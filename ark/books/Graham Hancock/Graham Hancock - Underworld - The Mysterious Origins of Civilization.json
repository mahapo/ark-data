I can only thank here a small number of the very many peoplewho have contributed to it in one way or another.First and foremost, thanks to my wife Santha, who travelled every step of thejourney with me, took all the risks side by side with me, did every dive withme, faced up to every challenge with me and lived and breathed Underworld forfive years just as I have done. Of course, all the photos in the book areSantha’s but there has only been space here to reproduce a tiny fraction ofthem. Many more of her wonderful pictures from our adventures appear on thesection of my website http://www.grahamhancock.com that is dedicated toUnderworld.Special thanks to Sharif Sakr, my brilliant researcher, who joined me straightout of Oxford University in the summer of 2000 when the writing phase of thebook was just beginning. Sharif is, in every sense, exactly what a greatresearcher should be – an original thinker and an individualistic self-starterwith huge intelligence, boundless energy and limitless initiative who neverneeds to be told what to do but who always just gets on and does it. Sharif’scontribution to the strengths of Underworld has been enormous.Thanks also to John Grigsby, my researcher for some years before Sharif joinedme, and to Shanti Faiia for her excellent work on researching, planning andcoordinating many of the diagrams in the book. Thanks to Sean Hancock forresearching Ice Age chronologies and chasing rumours of underwater ruins for usat Pohnpei and Kosrae. Thanks to Leila Hancock for her research on the natureand attributes of Siva. Thanks to Shakira Bagwandeen for research notes onvarious issues of Indian religion and prehistory.Dr Glenn Milne of Durham University’s Department of Geology played a crucialrole in generously providing all the inundation maps used in Underworld. Glenn’skindness in supplying these maps should not be taken as any sort of endorsementon his part of the broader theories and ideas presented here – which areentirely my own responsibility.Thanks to Ashraf Bechai for showing us the mysterious underwater megalithicsites off Alexandria, particularly the gigantic blocks of Sidi Gaber, whichorthodox archaeology has not yet come to terms with.In what I have to say about Malta I drew heavily on the remarkable research ofDr Anton Mifsud and want to express my thanks to him for allowing me to reporthis findings so extensively here. If, as I believe to be the case, an entirelynew chapter in the prehistory of Malta is about to open, then it is due toAnton’s tireless search for the truth and the far-reaching investigation that hecontinues to conduct into the Maltese past. Thanks also to Anton’s co-authors onhis various books – Charles Savona Ventura, Simon Mifsud and Chris AgiusSultana.In India I owe a debt of gratitude to all at the Archaeological Division of theNational Institute of Oceanography (NIO), in particular to Kamlesh Vora,Sundaresh and Dr A. S. Gaur. Special thanks, too, to Dr Ehrlich Desa, head ofthe NIO, who did so much to clear the way for our dives at Dwarka and Poompuhurand showed such good will and kindness towards us when Santha and I first turnedup at the NIO’s headquarters in Donna Paula, Goa.Thanks also to India’s National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), whoseground-breaking discoveries in the Gulf of Cambay are reported for the firsttime in this book. I mention in particular Dr S. Kathiroli, Project Director ofthe NIOT, Dr S. Badrinaryan, Geological Consultant to the NIOT, and G. JanakiRaman, Manager, Vessel Management Cell.So many good people have helped us in Japan over the years that it is simplyimpossible to mention all of them here. I hope those whose names are left outwill forgive me. Special mention must be made of our friend Shun Daichi, theJapanese translator of my books who accompanied me and Santha on our journeys inJapan – both above and below the water. Thanks too to Seamen’s Club, Ishigaki,and to the staff and management there whose help made all our diving adventuresin Japan possible. Outside Seamen’s Club, Kiyoshi Nagaki, Isamu Tsukahara,Kihachiro Aratake, Yohachiro Yoshimaru, Mitsutoshi Taniguchi and Kuzanori Kawaiall also dived with us and helped us in our underwater investigations.Last but not least, Santha and I want to thank our children Ravi Faiia, ShantiFaiia, Sean Hancock, Leila Hancock, Luke Hancock and Gabrielle Hancock forputting up with our preoccupations and prolonged absences from home. All thechildren have played their own parts in the quest, have learned to dive and havejoined us for some of our diving adventures. We’re proud and happy to have sucha bright and enterprising group of young people around us.Graham Hancock,London, January 2002"},{"pageContent":"PART ONEINITIATION"},{"pageContent":"1 / RELICSIf you do not expect it, you will not find the unexpected, for it is hard tofind and difficult.HeraclitusFive kilometres off the south-east coast of India, submerged at a depth of 23metres beneath the murky, shark-infested waters of the Bay of Bengal, an ancientman-made structure sits on the bottom of the sea. The structure is U-shaped,like a huge horseshoe; its periphery measures 85 metres and its walls are about1 metre thick and 2 metres high.1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn1]The discovery was made by a team of marine archaeologists from India’s NationalInstitute of Oceanography (NIO) in March 1991, working off-shore of theTranquebar-Poompuhur coast of Tamil Nadu near Nagapattinam. Their equipmentincluded side-scan sonar, which transmits an acoustic signal up to 1000 metreswide and measures the strength of the returning echo. Towed behind a researchvessel, side-scan sonar is capable of building accurate maps of sea-bed contoursand of identifying any obvious anomalies such as shipwrecks.On 7 March 1991 a shipwreck at a depth of 19 metres was pinpointed by the sonar.It was investigated by divers on 8 and 9 March, who found many scattered objectsincluding lead ingots and iron cannon on the surrounding sea-bed. The officialreport of the project then states:Till 1.00 p.m. [on 9 March] the divers were working on the scattered objects. T.C. S. Rao who was carrying out sonar survey 5 km opposite Chinnavanagiri [notfar from the wreck] reported another object 40 × 10 metres having the shape of aship [?] recorded on sonograph. Shri Bandodkar was sent to the site (designatedPMR2) and he placed two marker buoys there. By 2.00 p.m. Manavi and Chinni divedbut as the buoys had drifted the object could not be explored.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn2]A second side-scan sonar survey later in the afternoon refined the measurements,suggesting that the object was oval and measured ‘30–35 metres east to west and10 metres north to south with an apparent opening in one side’.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn3]On 16 and 19 March T. C. S. Rao continued the survey and now reported:There are actually three objects, the central one being oval-shaped with anopening on the northern side. Its longer axis is 20 metres. There is a claydeposit on the eastern flank beyond which another semi-circular structure isseen. To the north-west of the central object one or more oval-shaped objectsare found.4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn4]Finally on 23 March 1991 three divers were able to go down but only hadsufficient air to study the central structure. The official report describeswhat they saw as follows:a horseshoe-shaped object, its height being one to two metres. A few stoneblocks were found in the one-metre-wide arm. The distance between the two armsis 20 metres. Whether the object is a shrine or some other man-made structurenow at 23 metres depth remains to be examined in the next field season …5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn5]DEEP CAN MEAN VERY OLDIn the event no work could be done at the site in the next season, but in 1993the structure was examined again by the NIO’s diver archaeologists, who tookcareful measurements and eventually reported their findings as follows:The structure of U-shape was located at a water depth of 23 metres which isabout 5 kilometres off shore. The total peripheral length of the object is 85metres while the distance between the two arms is 13 metres and the maximumheight is 2 metres. The height of the eastern arm is greater than that of thewestern arm. The centre of the object is covered with sediment but some patchesof rock were noticed. Hand fanning showed that the central part of the object isrocky at a depth of 10–15 centimetres. Divers observed growth of thick marineorganism on the structure, but in some sections a few courses of masonry werenoted.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn6]Since 1993, for want of funding, no further marine archaeology has beenconducted along the Poompuhur coast and the general impression has beendisseminated in archaeological literature that the NIO has not found anysubmerged structures there that are older than the third century BC.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn7] This is certainly true of numerousstructures that were excavated very near to the shore, usually in depths of lessthan 2 metres of water and often half-exposed at low tide.8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn8] But the U-shaped structure at 23metres – more than 70 feet – is another matter altogether and cannot by anymeans be automatically assigned to the third century BC. On the contrary, sincewe know that the sea-level has been continuously rising during the last 19,000years,9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn9] common sense suggests thatstructures now submerged by 23 metres of water must be much older thanstructures in just 2 metres.‘NOBODY HAS LOOKED …’In February 2000 I travelled to Bangalore to the home of the doyen of India’smarine archaeologists, S. R. Rao, founder of the Marine Archaeology Centre atthe NIO and the man who had led the Tranquebar-Poompuhur survey. Rao is adistinguished, lean-faced man in his mid-seventies, with boundless energy andenthusiasm for his subject. After the pleasantries were over I told him that Iwas intrigued by the U-shaped structure his team had found at Poompuhur:‘Twenty-three metres is deep. Doesn’t that mean that it could be very old?’‘Correct, definitely,’ Rao replied. ‘That is what we are also thinking. In factwe took our ocean engineer also to see whether the structure had gone down as aresult of erosion by the sea or by its own weight. I don’t think that is thecase, because it is a huge structure which has been built at that depth – atthat time the sea was further out. This was built when it was above water. Thendoes the sea rise so much within such a short period was the question – 23metres just within 2000 years or so?’‘Maybe the sea-level rise that covered this structure took place a lot earlierthan that,’ I offered. ‘Maybe it belongs to a much earlier period than the2000-year-old ruins of Poompuhur up in the intertidal zone? There have beensea-level rises that could have done something like this but they took place along time ago – at the end of the Ice Age.’‘Correct. At that time it happened. You are correct.’‘There were three large floods at the end of the Ice Age – and even the mostrecent of these takes us back 8000 years. Is that a possible date for theU-shaped structure?’‘We don’t know,’ Rao replied, ‘because you see from whatever we have got we arenot able to decide its date at all.’‘Why is that?’‘Because amongst the samples we took we found no organic materials that could bedated by carbon 14 and no pottery that could be dated by thermo-luminescence orby type. We have only stone which cannot be dated in any meaningful sense.’‘Except by one factor – which is that the structure is now under 23 metres ofwater. So the sea-level rise itself can be helpful in indicating a date.’‘Correct. I do know that for the Gulf of Kutch in north-western India anoceanographic study has been made and the oceanographers themselves have saidthat at 10,000 BC the sea-level was 60 metres lower than it is today. If that istrue there it is also true here.’‘Which raises the possibility that we may be looking at remnants of a previouslyunknown ancient culture …’‘Ancient. Definitely!’ Rao exclaimed. ‘And, in fact, where really was the originof India’s earliest-known civilization – the Indus Valley civilization? Scholarsguess, but nobody knows. The Indus Valley script itself is already a highlydeveloped script when it first appears in the third millennium BC. The earlyarchitecture is already developed – you have got brick structures, you have gotdrains, everything is planned and all that – so there must be something beforethat. Where is the evolutionary phase? We don’t know.’Dr Rao was getting close to the real reason that I had come to see him. ‘Maybethe evidence of the evolutionary phase is underwater?’ I suggested.‘It’s underwater. Quite possible.’‘If so, then this underwater structure at Poompuhur could be incrediblyimportant – simply because of its depth …’‘Twenty-three metres …’‘Twenty-three metres. That’s right. Now if we can rule out land subsidence, andfurther work must be done before we can rule that out, but if we can rule thatout and if it’s an issue exclusively of sea-level rise, then we have a discoveryhere that calls into question the accepted chronology of civilization.’Rao pondered for a moment before replying: ‘You see, some people, sometraditions, do say that there was a continent in the Indian Ocean, a very longtime ago, more than 10,000 years ago, that got submerged … Quite possible. Yousee, we are not doing thorough research. If we had taken more time and morefunds and all that, perhaps we could find many more structures, not only thatone, and then you could come to some kind of conclusion about the much earlierepoch.’I told Rao that I was familiar with the south Indian traditions to which he wasreferring. These describe extensive lands, submerged about 11,000 years ago,that had once existed in the Indian Ocean to the south of the present CapeComorin. The name of these lost lands was Kumari Kandam. At the time of theirinundation, the traditions say, they had been the home of a high civilizationthat had even boasted an ‘Academy’ of advanced learning where philosophy andliterature were cultivated.‘It must have existed,’ Rao asserted. ‘You can’t rule that out at all.Particularly, as I have said, since we have found this structure at 23 metredepth. I mean, we have photographed it. It is there, anybody can go and see. Ido not believe that it is an isolated structure; further exploration is likelyto reveal others round about. And then you can go deeper, you see, and you mayget more important things.’I asked if there had been any further attempt since 1993 to find underwaterstructures off southern India.‘No,’ Rao replied. ‘Nobody has looked.’KEN SHINDO’S STORYIn 1996, four years before my meeting with Rao, my book Fingerprints of the Godsbecame the number-one bestseller in Japan, a country that had fascinated mesince childhood. The book’s success gave me my first opportunity to travelthere.I visited Japan twice that year to give a series of public lectures about theissues I’d explored in Fingerprints of the Gods. On the second visit I wasapproached after a lecture by a photojournalist named Ken Shindo, who works forthe influential Kyodo-Tsushin News Agency. He showed me striking under waterpictures that he had taken of a bizarre terraced structure, apparently aman-made monument of some kind, lying at depths of up to 30 metres off the southcoast of the Japanese island of Yonaguni. My central research and writinginterest, for years, has been the possibility of a lost civilization destroyedin the cataclysmic global floods that brought the last Ice Age to an end. So Iwas immediately fascinated by Shindo’s story: ‘An underwater ruin here inJapan!’ I exclaimed. ‘Is it definitely man-made?’Shindo laughed: ‘Some people say it’s a freak of nature but they haven’t spenttime on it like I have. I’m absolutely certain it’s man-made.’‘Does anyone know how old it is?’Shindo told me that he had been working with Professor Masaaki Kimura, a marineseismologist at the University of the Rykyus (Okinawa), who had been studyingYonaguni’s mysterious underwater structure since 1994. Kimura too was convincedit was man-made. His extensive survey, sampling and measurement had shown thatit had been hewn out of solid bedrock when the site was still above water. Ifsea-level rise were the only factor to take into account, then provisionalcalculations would indicate a date of inundation of around 10,000 years ago.That’s approximately 5000 years older than the oldest known monumental buildingson earth – the ziggurats of ancient Sumer in Mesopotamia.DAVY JONES’ LOCKERI knew that I had to learn to dive and talked my wife Santha into doing lessonswith me when we were on a visit to Los Angeles. We took our PADI Open-Watercourses in the chill, kelpy waters off Catalina Island in November 1996.My first reaction to diving was that it was a weird and scary experience,contrary to the laws of nature, and that I was unlikely to survive it. I waswrapped up like the Michelin Man in a full-body neoprene wetsuit, and thereseemed to be a ludicrous amount of equipment strapped, velcroed or clipped on tome.Let’s start at the feet. Here the diver wears short rubber boots tucked insidethe ankle-cuffs of his wetsuit. The wetsuit works by taking in a thin layer ofwater between the skin and the suit; this is rapidly warmed to body temperatureand remains warm for some time because the neoprene of the suit is an excellentinsulator. Over the boots are strapped the diver’s fins, without which he wouldbe almost as clumsy and immobile submerged as he is on land with all his gearon, and would unnecessarily waste a great deal of energy thrashing about.Strapped to his calf there should be a strong stainless-steel knife with a sharpblade – this can be life-saving if you get caught up in a drifting fishing netor some other equally uncompromising, usually man-made, hazard.Around the diver’s waist is a belt through which are threaded a number of leadweights to compensate for the natural buoyancy of the body and the additionalbuoyancy of the wetsuit. These days I can often get away with 2 kilos, butinexperienced divers need a lot more. On my first dives back in 1996 and intothe first half of 1997, I remember having to use 12 and in one case even 14kilos – a horrendous load.Moving on up the body, the next item of equipment the diver wears is a partiallyinflatable sleeveless jacket called a Buoyancy Control Device – ‘BCD’, or just‘BC’ for short. The scuba tank which provides the diver with air to breatheunderwater is strapped on to the back of the BC and typically comes in 10, 12and 15 litre sizes. A mid-sized tank weighs more than 15 kilos and for mostdives is filled with nothing other than normal air under enormous compression.This is delivered to the diver through two transformers which step down thepressure of the air to a level where it can be breathed easily. The‘first-stage’ is mounted immediately on top of the tank and removes most of thepressure, from here a rubber hose leads to the ‘second-stage’, or ‘regulator’,which is placed in the diver’s mouth and provides air on demand. Three otherrubber hoses also emerge from the first-stage. One of these connects to the BC,allowing the diver to power-inflate it direct from the tank. One leads to adangling instrument-console usually containing a compass and gauges that tellyou how much air you have left and how deep you are. The last, called the‘octopus’, is a spare second-stage for use in emergencies – for example toprovide air to another diver whose own tank is empty.Sometimes divers wear a rubber hood, since heat loss from the unprotected headis very rapid. A glass-fronted mask, without which the human eye can onlyperceive blurred images under water, covers the eyes and nose. The final majorpieces of equipment are a small wrist computer, which can save your life bywarning you if you are ascending too fast from depth, and a pair of gloves tokeep your hands warm and prevent grazing or accidental contact with unpleasantmarine organisms like fire coral.Wrapped up in all this stuff, with our total scuba experience at that timeamounting to just three half-hour swimming-pool dives each, Santha and Icontemplated the waters of the Pacific with certain misgivings. To be honest, wewere afraid. It looked deep and dark and dangerous down there, down amongst thewaving streamers of kelp, down in Davy Jones’ Locker … But if we wanted to seethat incredible underwater structure in Japan for ourselves then we were goingto have to do this. On our instructor’s command we jumped in and paddled outfrom shore.Four days later we were licensed but definitely not yet experienced enough todive at Yonaguni.A GENEROUS OFFERI did not know when we would be able to organize a diving trip to Japan but knewonly that it would be expensive. Then a strange synchronicity occurred. Out ofthe blue some time in January 1997 I received a fax from an American companyrepresenting a Japanese businessman. The fax said that the business man had readFingerprints of the Gods and would like to invite Santha and me to flyfirst-class to Yonaguni at his expense to explore the island and to dive at themonument. He would ensure our safety by sending a group of top-flight divinginstructors with us from the Seamen’s Club, a hotel and dive school on theneighbouring island of Ishigaki. He would also provide us with a fully equippeddive boat and all other facilities.There were no strings attached to this generous offer, which we accepted. InMarch 1997 we flew from London to Tokyo and then via Okinawa to Yonaguni to doour first dives there. This was the beginning of a long-term friendship with thebusinessman (whose privacy I protect) and of what began as an informal projectto explore, document and try to understand the sequence of ancient and highlyanomalous structures that have been found underwater at Yonaguni and at otherislands in south-west Japan.YONAGUNIThe first anomalous structure that was discovered at Yonaguni lies belowglowering cliffs of the southern shore of the island. Local divers call it IsekiPoint (‘Monument Point’). Into its south face, at a depth of about 18 metres, anarea of terracing with conspicuous flat planes and right-angles has been cut.Two huge parallel blocks weighing approximately 30 tonnes each and separated bya gap of less than 10 centimetres, have been placed upright side by side at itsnorth-west corner. In about 5 metres of water at the very top of the structurethere is a kidney-shaped ‘pool’ and near by is a feature that many diversbelieve is a crude rock-carved image of a turtle. At the base of the monument,in 27 metres of water, there is a clearly defined stone-paved path orientedtowards the east.If the diver follows this path – a relatively easy task, since there is often astrong west-to-east current here – he will come in a few hundred metres to ‘themegalith’, a rounded, 2 tonne boulder that seems to have been purposely placedon a carved ledge at the centre of a huge stone platform.10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn10]Two kilometres west of Iseki Point is the ‘Palace’. Here an underwaterpassageway leads into the northern end of a spacious chamber with megalithicwalls and ceiling. At the southern end of the chamber a tall, lintelled doorwayleads into a second smaller chamber beyond. At the end of that chamber is avertical, rock-hewn shaft that emerges outside on the roof of the ‘Palace’. Nearby a flat rock bears a pattern of strange, deep grooves. A little further eastthere is a second megalithic passage roofed by a gigantic slab that fits snuglyagainst the tops of the supporting walls.Two kilometres to the east of Iseki Point is Tategami Iwa, literally ‘TheStanding God Stone’, a natural pinnacle of rugged black rock that soars up outof the ocean. At its base, 18 metres underwater, there is a horizontal tunnel,barely wide enough to fit a diver, that runs perfectly straight west to east andemerges amidst a scatter of large blocks with clean-cut edges.A three-minute swim to the south-east brings the diver to what looks like anextensive ceremonial complex carved out of stone. Here at depths of 15 to 25metres there are massive rectilinear structures with sheer walls separated bywide avenues.At the centre is the monument that local divers refer to as ‘the stone stage’.Into its south-facing corner either man or nature has carved an image that looksto some like a gigantic anthropoid face with two clearly marked eyes …KERAMAAt Aka Island in the Kerama group 40 kilometres west of Okinawa, local divershave been aware for some years of the existence of a series of underwater stonecircles at depths of 30 metres. There are also associated rectilinear formationswithin the same general area that show some signs of having been cut and workedby human beings.Diving conditions at Kerama are atrociously difficult (as indeed they often areat Yonaguni too). There is a killer current, but this drops away almost tonothing for approximately an hour between tides. Only in that lull is itpossible to get any serious work done and to gain a perspective on the enigmaticstructures without constantly having to fight against the sea.Kerama’s most spectacular feature is ‘Centre Circle’, which has a diameter ofapproximately 20 metres and a maximum depth of 27 metres. Here concentric ringsof upright megaliths more than 3 metres tall have been hewn out of the bedrocksurrounding a central menhir.A second, similar circle, called ‘Small Centre Circle’ by local divers, standsimmediately to the north-east. It is not noticeably smaller than the first.A little to the south is ‘Stone Circle’, which is made up of much smaller,rounded stones. It has a huge diameter of about 150 metres. Within it aresubsidiary stone circles sometimes touching one another at their edges like thelinks of a chain.AGUNIAguni Island, 60 kilometres north of Kerama, has steep and forbidding cliffs. Onthe south-west side of the island these cliffs overlook an area of turbulentwater that local fishermen call the ‘washing machine’. The turbulence is causedby the presence of a sea-mount that ascends from much greater depths to form asmall plateau only 4 metres under the surface. This plateau, perpetually sweptby strong currents, contains a series of circular holes that look initially likewell-shafts.As they are lined with small blocks, there is little doubt that these shafts areman-made. The largest and deepest has a diameter of 3 metres and reaches amaximum depth (below the summit of the sea-mount) of about 10 metres. Others aretypically 2 to 3 metres in diameter with a depth of less than 7 metres. A feware narrower and shallower. One has a small subsidiary chamber cut sideways intothe wall of the main shaft.CHATANThe coastline around Okinawa has been the subject of intensive developmentduring the past half-century. Thirty kilometres north of the capital Naha, onthe west coast of the island, is the popular resort area of Chatan. Here, lessthan a kilometre off-shore, at depths of between 10 and 30 metres, is strewn alooming underwater fantasia of ‘walls’ and ‘battlements’ and ‘step pyramids’.Are these weird submerged structures natural or man-made? And if they areman-made then when, and by whom?One possibility suggested to me by local fishermen is that the ‘structures’could be artefacts of relatively recent military dredging. Certainly, severallarge US Air Force bases are located very close to Chatan and the site isconstantly overflown by all kinds of American warplanes doing manoeuvres. Istill remain open to the possibility that dredging could have produced some ofthe features to be seen underwater, but against this I have received a reportfrom Akira Suzuki, a Japanese historical researcher, who has carefullyinvestigated both US and Japanese archives in Okinawa and has been unable tofind any record of such operations in this area.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn11]The most striking of the Chatan structures is a wall with its base on the sandybottom at a depth of 30 metres. It rises to a ‘battlement’ with a sunken‘walkway’ about 10 metres above the sea-bed. At a certain point the walkway isbroken by a vertical U-shaped shaft cut through the entire height of the wall.To dive at Chatan is to be reminded of an episode in the Nihongi, one of Japan’smost ancient texts, a chronicle of the earliest times. Here, in a longintroductory section entitled ‘The Age of the Gods’, there is a passage thatdescribes how a deity named Ho-ho-demi no Mikoto climbed into an upendedwaterproof basket and descended to the bottom of the sea. In this makeshiftsubmarine ‘he found himself at a pleasant strand … proceeding on his way hesuddenly arrived at the palace of the Sea-God. This palace was provided withbattlements and turrets and had stately towers.’No doubt the many curious things that the Nihongi has to say about the Age ofthe Gods may all be explained as mythology and imagination. Still, I find itcurious in Japan, where there are so many underwater ‘anomalies’, that such avenerable ancient text contains a clear tradition of submerged structures thatcan only be visited by divers.15,000 YEARSBetween 1996 and 2000, while I increased my practical diving experience ofJapan’s underwater ruins, I several times got caught up in the virulent debateabout their provenance. Some scholars and journalists think they are entirelynatural or ‘mostly natural’ (Robert Schoch of Boston University, for example).Others, such as Professor Kimura and Professor Teruaki Ishii of TokyoUniversity, remain convinced that they are man-made but are uncertain as totheir antiquity (in addition to sea-level rise, complex factors such as possibleland subsidence – through volcanism, plastic flow or isostatic rebound – must betaken into account when determining the date of submergence of any givensite).12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn12] No early resolution ofthis debate can be expected, since we are dealing here as much with matters ofopinion as with matters of generally agreed fact. Those who think the structuresare natural are likely to go on thinking so no matter what the other side says –and vice-versa. It looks like a stalemate.Yet there is a potentially fruitful line of inquiry, capable of shedding lighton this problem, which neither side has yet considered. Whether they wereflooded by rising sea-levels or because of some form of land subsidence into thesea (quite possible in an area of great seismic instability like Japan) all theunderwater ruins were above water at some point between 17,000 years ago (theend of the Last Glacial Maximum) and 2000 years ago – the latest date thatanyone has suggested for their submergence.What happened in Japan during this 15,000-year period? Could it be that there issomething concealed in the remote prehistory of these islands that would providea context and perhaps even a completely rational explanation for the underwaterruins?ALEXANDRIADuring 1998 and 1999 the Egyptian Mediterranean city of Alexandria was much inthe news. French archaeologists, led by the melodiously named Dr Jean-YvesEmpereur of the National Centre for Scientific Research, had announced thediscovery of submerged ruins, complete with underwater columns, sphinxes andgranite statues. In the same location they also claimed to have found theremains of the famed Pharos, or Lighthouse – 135 metres tall and one of theSeven Wonders of the ancient world13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn13] – that had overlookedAlexandria’s Eastern Harbour from the point where the fort of the Mamelukesultan Qait Bey now stands. Though it was thought to have been built in theearly third century BC, historical reports suggest that at least part of thegiant lighthouse remained intact until 8 August AD 1303, when a tremendousearthquake struck the Egyptian coast.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn14]Researching my earlier books had given me little reason to go to Alexandria.During a decade of travels in Egypt my focus had always been on the oldest sites– those going back to the third millennium BC and perhaps further – sites likeGiza, with the three Pyramids and the Great Sphinx, Saqqara, where theremarkable Pyramid Texts are inscribed inside the tombs of Fifth and SixthDynasty Pharaohs, and Abydos, with First Dynasty boat graves and the mysteriousOsireion.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn15]Since it was common knowledge that Alexandria had not existed until 332 BC, thedate of its foundation by Alexander the Great,16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn16] I had always felt that it wasunlikely to hold much of interest to me. I was vaguely aware that it had beenbuilt upon the site of an earlier settlement named Rhakotis or Raqote, but sincethis was usually described as ‘an obscure fishing village’,17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn17] I never suspected for a momentthat there might be significant traces of earlier monumental constructions inthe area.None of the underwater discoveries that were made public at the end of the 1990sdid anything to change my view. They too belonged to what is called thePtolemaic period of Egypt, named for the ruling dynasty – of which Cleopatra wasthe last monarch – established soon after Alexander’s death by his generalPtolemy. I was at first intrigued to learn that inscriptions belonging to muchearlier Pharaohs had been found amongst the underwater ruins – the cartouche ofRameses II (1290–1224 BC) on pink-granite ‘papyriform’ columns from Aswan, anobelisk of his father Seti (1306–1290 BC), a sphinx from the time of SenuseretIII (1878–1841 BC) and numerous other artefacts and objects bearing ancientinscriptions.18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn18]On good grounds, archaeologists did not regard such discoveries as evidence ofany earlier monumental settlement in Alexandria but rather of a well-knownPtolemaic habit of borrowing pieces of religious art and architecture fromtemples that had been built throughout Egypt by earlier Pharaohs.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn19] Jean-Yves Empereur was very clearon this point:The numerous products of the Pharaonic period – sphinxes, obelisks and papyruscolumns [found underwater around Qait Bey] – do not make any significantdifference to what we already know about the history of Alexandria and itsfoundation by Alexander the Great.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn20]DIVING WITH EMPEREURA research trip to Alexandria was easy to talk myself out of. Since what wasknown of its history was that it had no history before the end of the fourthcentury BC, there was obviously no good reason for me to go there. The ruins ofthe Pharos and of what looked like an extensive complex of buildings seaward ofit had not been submerged in the period I was interested in – the end of thelast Ice Age – but between the fourth century BC and the thirteenth century AD,most probably as a result of what geologists call ‘vertical tectonic subsidence’caused by earthquakes.21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn21] Besides,there is a complicated permissions ordeal which one must undergo if one wishesto dive at Alexandria involving the Ministry of Information, the Ministry ofNational Security, the Supreme Council of Antiquities, the Police, Customs andthe Navy. The whole process routinely takes a month …So I’d pretty much quashed the idea before it took shape when I remembered thatmy good friend Robert Bauval was born in Alexandria and that several members ofhis large, globe-trotting family were still living there. On a whim I telephonedhim – he lives just outside London – and asked him if he knew anything aboutEmpereur and whether he thought it would be possible to fix up a day ofunofficial diving with the French team.Rob is reputed to have worked miracles in Alexandria, even from as far away asEngland. I therefore wasn’t too surprised when he called me back the next dayand informed me that he had spoken to his great-aunt Fedora, who knew Empereurwell; she in turn had put in a good word with the archaeologist. The upshot wasthat we would be allowed to dive at Qait Bey without formality, any time thatsuited us in the next few weeks.SLEEP OF YEARSOn 30 September 1999 Santha and I, hefting our gear, met up with Robert at thegatehouse to Qait Bey fort. He ushered us inside its medieval limestone walls,soothing the guard in Arabic, and led us to a yard where scuba tanks were laidout and a group of young archaeologists, the men muscular, with stubbly chins,the women tanned and serious, were donning wetsuits and checking gear.Empereur, in his late forties, was older than the rest of his team. He waswearing a tropical linen jacket and a Panama hat and carrying a briefcase.‘Excuse me,’ he now said as we shook hands, ‘but I have to rush off, so I won’tbe diving with you today.’‘No problem. I’m really very grateful to you for allowing us to do this at allat such short notice.’Empereur shrugged: ‘My pleasure. I hope you enjoy yourselves.’ He introduced usto the other team members, then we shook hands again and he strode away.Because it’s hard to take notes underwater, I normally document my dives onvideo. It was my intention to do so now, but as we were getting ready I was toldthat this would not be permitted. Santha, likewise, was asked to leave her threeNikonos 5s behind. Apparently it was something to do with an exclusive deal thathad been signed with the French photo agency Sygma. Robert protestedvociferously on our behalf and as a compromise it was ultimately agreed thatSantha could use her cameras but that my video would not be allowed under anycircumstances.Once that was settled we were led down through a series of dank stone corridorswith arrow-slits overlooking the sea until we emerged at the edge of the island– long since connected to the mainland by a causeway – on which Qait Bey stands.Here we put on our gear and tanks, jumped into the water with one of thearchaeologists as our guide and descended at once into a submarine wonderlandless than a dozen metres below us.It may be the most beautiful ancient site I have ever had the privilege toexplore. The visibility was poor, which added a kind of foggy glamour to thescene, and we had to criss-cross the ruin-field many times, over three lengthydives, before I began to appreciate how vast and how heterogeneous it was. Therewere huge numbers of columns, some broken, some virtually intact, but alltumbled and fallen. There were Doric column bases surrounded by tumbled debris.Here and there one or two courses of a wall could be seen, rising up out of themurk. There were dozens of metre-wide hemispherical stones, hollowed inside, ofa type that I had never encountered before in Egypt. There were several smallsphinxes, one broken jaggedly in half, and large segments of more than onegranite obelisk seemed to have been tossed about like matchsticks. There werealso quarried granite blocks scattered everywhere. Most were in the 2–3 squaremetre range but some were much larger – 70 tonnes or more. A notable group ofthese behemoths, some a staggering 11 metres in length, lay in a line runningsouth-west to north-east in the open waters just outside Qait Bey. When Iresearched the matter later I learnt that they were amongst the blocks thatEmpereur had identified as coming from the Pharos:some of them are broken into two or even three pieces, which shows that theyfell from quite a height. In view of the location the ancient writers give forthe lighthouse, and taking into consideration the technical difficulty of movingsuch large objects, it is probable that these are parts of the Pharos itselfwhich lie where they were flung by a particularly violent earthquake.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn22]There were exquisite moments when the sun broke through the clouds that lay overAlexandria that day and cast a beam of light down into some dark corner of thesubmerged ruins. Then the vanquished structures over which we were diving seemedto regather their former stature, like ghosts returning to flesh, beforecollapsing once again into their sleep of years.TREASURE OF THE SUNKEN CITYA few weeks later I still hadn’t been able to get the images of what I’d seenunderwater off Qait Bey out of my mind, or quite rid myself of the feeling thatI might have missed something important there. Without any particular objectiveI began to buy books about Alexandria and to acquaint myself better with thestory of its past. Visiting Amazon.com one evening in mid-October, I found thatsomeone was offering a second-hand copy of Alexandria – A History and a Guidewritten during the First World War and published in 1922 by the British novelistE. M. Forster.23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn23] I bought it atonce, for it is rumoured to be a fount of wisdom. Then I snapped up, in quicksuccession, The Library of Alexandria – Centre of the Ancient World, edited byRoy Macleod; Life and Fate of the Ancient Library of Alexandria by MostafaEl-Abbadi; Philo’s Alexandria by Dorothy L. Sly; and The Vanished Library byLuciano Canfora.24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn24]Oddly enough, Amazon’s search-engine couldn’t immediately find me anything whenI entered the keyword Pharos. While I was thinking about what to search for next– maybe Seven Wonders of the ancient world? – I called up Jean-Yves Empereur’sname to see the complete list of his publications. I already owned his bookAlexandria Rediscovered, which told the story of the underwater excavations atQait Bey, but I hoped that he might have written other books about the region.He hadn’t and I found myself looking at Amazon’s sparse sales page forAlexandria Rediscovered.There was one review, from a reader in Phoenix, Arizona. He wrote that he wishedno disrespect to Dr Empereur; however, after seventeen years as anarchaeological diver in Egypt, he could not agree that Empereur’s team had foundthe Pharos. What they had found was interesting, yes, important, yes, but it wasdefinitely not the Pharos.What was someone who’d worked for seventeen years as an archaeological diver inEgypt now doing in Phoenix, Arizona? And what did he know – or think he knew –about the Pharos? My instincts told me that there could be a story here, andalthough the reviewer did not give his name, there was an e-mail address. I senthim a message at once, explaining my interest in the underwater ruins ofAlexandria and asking him to elaborate on his views about the Pharos.The next day, 17 October, I received this reply:Mr Graham,My name is Ashraf Bechai. I am the former leader of the Maritime Museumunderwater team (1986/89). I am also a former diving engineer of the Instituteof Nautical Archaeology. You can find a little more about me on the Instituteweb page. I will be glad to help you with any question you have.Sincerely, Ashraf Bechai,Phoenix AZ, USA.Attached was an extraordinary 23-page report titled Treasure of the Sunken City:The Truth About the Discovery of the Lighthouse.ASHRAF BECHAI’S STORYWhat came across in Ashraf’s Bechai’s angry and impassioned report was a sense,above all else, of intellectual outrage. In his view Jean-Yves Empereur and histeam had been altogether too narrow-minded in their interpretation of what theyhad found underwater at Qait Bey:During the last three years there have been many claims that the Frenchmarine-archaeological team that has been working underwater in the area of QaitBey Fort has found the remains of a great building, identified by French andEgyptian archaeologists as the remains of the Pharos lighthouse.But is it the Pharos?I don’t see why we have to take it as they say without asking any questions. Idon’t see why we’re expected to suspend our common sense just because this stuffis underwater and looks very spectacular on television.Bechai pointed out that if the Pharos had indeed been more than 100 metres tall,as all historical sources maintain, then it must have been a truly enormousbuilding. The Great Pyramid of Giza, for example, which is 150 metres tall, witha base area of more than 13 acres, weighs 6 million tonnes and consists of 21/2million individual stone blocks.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn25] Since the building technology ofthe fourth century BC was, if anything, inferior to that of the third millenniumBC, it is therefore unlikely that the lighthouse – with a reported height of 135metres-could have had a base area of less than 12 acres or a weight of much lessthan 5 million tonnes. ‘Imagine how big the pile of stones that should remainfrom a building like that,’ suggested Bechai:Could this great amount of stone just disappear? Vanish in the water? The truthis that this much stone would have created an island in the sea and all thestatues, sphinxes and other ancient Egyptian artefacts that the French team havefound intermingled with the blocks would have been buried forever under a greatpile of rock.Even if one supposes – against the evidence – that a far superior buildingtechnology existed in Alexandrian times than in the times of the Great Pyramid,and even if one reduces the height of the Pharos from 135 metres to 100 metres,it is still extremely unlikely that it could have been built with less than halfa million individual stone blocks (as against the Pyramid’s 21/2 millionblocks). But let us reduce it still further – to just 100,000 blocks, or even50,000.Yet Empereur writes: ‘As soon as one puts one’s head under the water around QaitBey one begins to feel dizzy at the sight of the 3000 or so architectural blockswhich carpet the sea-bed.’26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn26] Itwas precisely this ‘dizzying’ spectacle of only 3000 blocks that botheredBechai. If the ruins around Qait Bey were the remains of the lighthouse andassociated structures, then 3000 blocks was nowhere near enough:Three thousand blocks wouldn’t even build a large temple let alone a lighthouse100 metres high! And many of the blocks in Empereur’s survey are scattered veryfar from Qait Bey. Some are almost a kilometre away. There is even one 75-tongranite block half a kilometre out to sea and 1.5 kilometres distant from QaitBey. Are we supposed to believe that the earthquake was powerful enough to throwa 75-ton block as far as that?Bechai also made another valid point. Ancient texts referring to the Pharosconcurred that it had been built of blocks of ‘white stone’ – limestone – whichis plentifully available locally. Yet the underwater ruin-field outside Qait Beyconsists primarily of scattered granite blocks and other architectural elements,such as columns, also made out of granite – a much more intractable materialthat had to be brought to Alexandria from quarries almost 1000 kilometres to thesouth. Whilst admitting that limestone does have a much faster rate of erosionthan granite, Bechai did not believe that the vast amount of limestone thatwould have been required for the Pharos could possibly all have eroded away. Heconcluded:What we have at this site are scattered artefacts from different ages, differentdesigns of blocks, columns and statues – not an indication of one thing but anindication of many things.THE GIANT BLOCKS OF SIDI GABERBefore I was half-way through the report I realized that it pinpointed paradoxesand anomalies that I had completely missed during my dives with the French team.No doubt Empereur would have answers to all these questions but at this stage Ihad to admit that the questions themselves sounded reasonable.As I read on I realized that Bechai was agitated about much more than just theproblem of the Pharos. He wrote: ‘I have seen things underwater in Alexandriaduring the last 17 years that challenge all our knowledge of the history of thisarea.’ As an example he reported how in 1984 he had gone spear-fishing with somefriends off-shore of Sidi Gaber, a district along Alexandria’s crowded Corniche,some 3 kilometres to the east of Qait Bey:We were about two kilometres from shore, diving off a small boat. I rememberthat the visibility underwater was exceptionally good. We hadn’t been expectingthat because there had been a storm a few days before which moved around a lotof the sand and silt on the bottom. Suddenly I saw hundreds of huge sandstone orlimestone blocks laid out in three rows, each two courses high, that had beenexposed on the sea-bed at a depth of about six to eight metres. The blocksappeared to be of identical dimensions – four metres wide by four metres long bytwo metres high. They were stacked up on an underwater ridge of some sort,because there was deeper water between them and the shore. All around there werehundreds more blocks of similar size that were heavily eroded, or damaged, orhad fallen out of line.This group of blocks has been seen on and off by fishermen and divers over atleast 25 years and there is still no proper explanation for it. I have neverbeen so lucky with the visibility there again, nor the same bottom conditions,and despite many subsequent attempts to relocate the site I have so far failedto do so.Another interesting site, one that Bechai hadn’t seen himself, was the so-calledKinessa, an Arabic word meaning ‘church’ or ‘temple’:If you have lived in the wonderful city of Alexandria long enough and hadconnection with fishermen who do commercial net fishing then you must have heardabout ‘A1 Kinessa’. Some say that it is out in the open sea about one kilometreto the north of Qait Bey and that when an east wind blows and the waters areclear you can sometimes see what look like the remains of a building underwater.Others claim it is much further north – perhaps as much as five kilometres outfrom shore. Three different people told me very specifically that it is fivekilometres north to north-west of Qait Bey. Before reaching it the sea-bedslopes down to 40 metres where the bottom is sandy with a few patches of rock;then you pass an area of rocky pinnacles, some as much as 20 metres high juttingout of another sandy bed; then the bottom profile rises up sharply from 40metres to just 18 metres in depth creating a smooth-sided, flat-topped hill fivekilometres from shore in the middle of nowhere. That is where they say theKinessa is.MYSTERY OF THE SEAAfter I had read Ashraf Bechai’s report I began to correspond with him aboutspecific points by e-mail, and in due course we agreed that we would divetogether to try to relocate the Sidi Gaber blocks and the Kinessa during thesummer of 2000. Although his home was now in Phoenix, Arizona, where he ran abusiness, he told me that he still returned to Alexandria for at least threemonths every year and would be happy to work with me there so long as I couldextract the necessary permits from the authorities.There were other travels to do in the meantime. On one trip, I don’t rememberwhere, I took E. M. Forster’s Alexandria – A History and a Guide with me asairplane reading. In it I was intrigued to learn that Forster had drawnattention to a report published in 1910 by the French archaeologist GastonJondet and entitled Les Ports submerges de l’ancienne île de Pharos.27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn27] According to Jondet, Forstersaid, someone had built a series of huge megalithic walls and causeways somedistance off the coast of Alexandria beyond the island of Pharos that were nowsubmerged to a depth of up to 8 metres beneath the sea. The character of theseconstructions, he judged, was ‘prehistoric’.28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn28] Summarizing reactions to thediscovery, Forster wrote:Theosophists, with more zeal than probability, have annexed it to the vanishedcivilization of Atlantis; M. Jondet inclines to the theory that it may beMinoan-built by the maritime power of Crete. If Egyptian in origin, perhaps thework of Rameses II (B.C. 1300) … The construction … gives no hint as tonationality or date. It cannot be as late as Alexander the Great or we shouldhave records. It is the oldest work in the district and also the most romanticfor to its antiquity is added the mystery of the sea.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn29]I wondered how many archaeologists today shared Forster’s view about theantiquity and romance of the prehistoric harbour. I knew for sure that Jean-YvesEmpereur did not. His on-the-record opinion, in full accord with the mainstreamscholarly view, was that before Alexander’s arrival ‘the only inhabitants of thearea must have been a few fishermen and perhaps also a garrison stationed hereto guard the approaches to the Delta’.30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn30] But if so, then who had built themuch older and now submerged harbour – if it was indeed a harbour? And how didit fit in, if at all, with the megalithic blocks underwater at Sidi Gaber, orthe elusive Kinessa that fishermen said appeared and disappeared beneath thesparkling waves – now you see it, now you don’t – like the Sea King’s castle?RUMOURS OF THE DELUGEDescriptions of a killer global flood that inundated the inhabited lands of theworld turn up everywhere amongst the myths of antiquity. In many cases thesemyths clearly hint that the deluge swept away an advanced civilization that hadsomehow angered the gods, sparing ‘none but the unlettered and the uncultured’31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn31] and obliging the survivors to‘begin again like children in complete ignorance of what happened … in earlytimes’.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn32] Such stories turn up inVedic India, in the pre-Columbian Americas, in ancient Egypt. They were told bythe Sumerians, the Babylonians, the Greeks, the Arabs and the Jews. They wererepeated in China and south-east Asia, in prehistoric northern Europe and acrossthe Pacific. Almost universally, where truly ancient traditions have beenpreserved, even amongst mountain peoples and desert nomads, vivid descriptionshave been passed down of global floods in which the majority of mankindperished.33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn33]To take these myths seriously, and especially to countenance the possibilitythat they might be telling the truth, would be a risky posture for any modernscholar to adopt, inviting ridicule and rebuke from colleagues. The academicconsensus today, and for a century, has been that the myths are either purefantasy or the fantastic elaboration of local and limited deluges – caused forexample by rivers overflowing, or tidal waves.34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn34] ‘It has long been known,’commented the illustrious anthropologist Sir J. G. Frazer in 1923,that legends of a great flood in which almost all men perished are widelydiffused over the world … Stories of such tremendous cataclysms are almostcertainly fabulous; [but] it is possible and indeed probable that under amythical husk many of them may hide a kernel of truth; that is they may containreminiscences of inundations which really overtook particular districts, butwhich in passing through the medium of popular tradition have been magnifiedinto worldwide catastrophes.35 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn35]Unquestioningly following Frazer’s lead, scholars to this day still persist inseeing flood stories asrecollections – vastly distorted and exaggerated … of real local disasters …There is not one deluge legend but rather a collection of traditions which areso diverse that they can be explained neither by one general catastrophe alone,nor by the dissemination of one local tradition alone … Flood traditions arenearly universal … mainly because floods in the plural are the most nearlyuniversal of all geologic catastrophes.36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn36]Not all mainstream academics toe this line. But amongst those who don’t it seemsto have been generally agreed that almost any explanation, however harebrained,is more acceptable than a simple literal interpretation of the myth of a globalflood – i.e. that there actually was a global flood … or floods. For example,this from Alan Dundes, Professor of Anthropology and Folklore at the Universityof California, Berkeley, is regarded as a perfectly acceptable scholarlyposition on the problem: ‘The myth is a metaphor – a cosmogenic projection ofsalient details of human birth insofar as every infant is delivered from a“flood” of amniotic fluid.’37 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn37]My guess is that such thinking will not much longer survive the steadyaccumulation of scientific evidence which suggests that a series of giganticcataclysms, exactly like those described in the flood myths, changed the face ofthe earth completely between 17,000 years ago and 8000 years ago. At thebeginning of this period of extraordinary climatic turbulence and extremes,fully evolved human beings of the modern type are thought to have been inexistence for 100,000 years38 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn38] –long enough in theory for at least some of them to have evolved a highcivilization. While much of the land they formerly lived on is now submergedbeneath the sea, and as unfamiliar to archaeologists as the dark side of themoon, how certain can we really be that some of them did not?DARK ZONESCUBA is the acronym for the ‘Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus’invented by the late Jacques Cousteau and Emile Gagnan in 1943.39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn39] At first thought likely to beexpensive and of use only to specialists, the technology rapidly entered themass market and, today, scuba-diving is the world’s fastest-growing sport.40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn40]Although it should be obvious, it is worth remembering that only sincescuba-diving was introduced has any kind of systematic marine archaeology becomepossible. Moreover, funds for this kind of research are limited, and the oceansare extremely large – constituting, in fact, more than 70 per cent of theearth’s surface.41 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn41] Marinearchaeologists have barely been able to begin the investigation of the millionsupon millions of square kilometres of coastal shelf inundated since the end ofthe last Ice Age. As a result, the underwater world continues to constitute agaping dark zone in human knowledge; it is entirely possible that archaeologicalsurprises and upsets await us there.Question: Why has the first extensive evidence of large-scale prehistoricstructures beneath the sea come from Japan?Answer: Japan has more scuba-divers than any other country and it follows thatits coastal waters have been more thoroughly explored than those of any othercountry.Question: Why have the main underwater structures in Japan all been found southof the thirtieth parallel?Answer: Because most sport divers prefer warm water. There may be structuresfurther north as well which simply haven’t been noticed yet because few diversare attracted to the cold or stormy seas in which they lie.India is the opposite of Japan. It has almost no leisure-diving industry (just acouple of dive-shops in the whole subcontinent)42[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn42] but it does have marinearchaeologists like S. R. Rao whose minds are open to extraordinarypossibilities. Rao’s work around Poompuhur was guided by ancient Tamiltraditions that speak of the submergence of large masses of land off southernIndia thousands of years ago.43 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn43]And he himself admits that the ‘U-shaped structure’ found at 23 metres is hardto explain within the orthodox framework of history.‘11,000 YEARS OLD, OR OLDER’In August 2000 I took on a new research assistant, Sharif Sakr, who had justgraduated in Human Sciences from Oxford University. One of the first tasks Igave him was to find me a top-flight academic, in Britain, who would be preparedto act as a kind of ‘resident expert’ on sea-level rise and who would bequalified to give an authoritative opinion on the date of submergence of almostany underwater structure in the world. Sharif came back to me with Dr GlennMilne, a specialist in glacio-isostacy and glaciation-induced sea-level changeat Durham University’s Department of Geology. Milne and his colleagues haveestablished a worldwide reputation predicting ancient sea-level changes and thecorresponding changes in the earth’s coastlines. Their predictions are based ona sophisticated computer model that has been under development since the 1970sand that takes into account many variables beyond changes caused solely by themelting of ice-sheets – the technical term is eustacy.44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn44]In October 2000 Sharif approached Milne on my behalf and asked him to calculatethe latest date that the large U-shaped structure and other nearby structuresoff the coast of Poompuhur could have been submerged.Thursday 12 October 2000, Sharif Sakr to Glenn Milne: Hi Glenn,Hope everything’s OK.Just a quick question: I’ve got a series of structures 5 kilometres off thesouth-east coast of India (Tamil Nadu region, probably roughly around 11N, 80Eas a rough guess).45 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn45] Thestructures are 23 metres underwater – which is extremely deep. If we assume onlyeustatics, then the implication would be that the structures are older thanaround 7000 BC. But there is also isostatic subsidence to consider: whatproportion of that 23 metres depth, as a rough off-the-record guess, could beexplained away through subsidence?Does the depth of the structures still suggest great antiquity, even whenisostatics are brought into the equation?Thursday 12 October 2000, Glenn Milne to Sharif Sakr: Hi Sharif,I did a quick model run for that site and the predicted sea-level curve showsthat areas currently at 23m depth would have been submerged about 11,000 yearsbefore the present. This suggests that the structures you mention are 11thousand years old or older!NO CIVILIZATION KNOWN TO HISTORY …Although I could not be certain of anything until I was able to dive on itmyself, the early descriptions of the U-shaped structure by the NIO’s marinearchaeologists left little doubt that it was man-made. The ‘stone blocks’ and‘courses of masonry’ that had been reported by all these experienced witnessesseemed to exclude any possibility that it could be natural or recent – or indeedanything other than the ruins of a very old stone building, resting on bedrock,constructed here before the ocean rose to cover it.Now, as I studied the e-mail from Glenn Milne, I knew just how ancient theU-shaped structure really might be – at least 11,000 years old. That’s 6000years older than the first monumental architecture of ancient Egypt or ofancient Sumer in Mesopotamia – traditionally thought of as the oldestcivilizations of antiquity. Certainly, no civilization known to history existedin southern India – or anywhere else – 11,000 years ago. Yet the U-shapedstructure off the Tranquebar-Poompuhur coast invites us to consider thepossibility that it was the work of a civilization that archaeologists have asyet failed to identify – one whose primary ruins could have been missed becausethey are submerged so deep beneath the sea."},{"pageContent":"2 / THE RIDDLE OF THE ANTEDILUVIAN CITIESAnd the Lord planted a garden eastward in Eden … And out of the ground made theLord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food …And a river went out of Eden to water the garden …Genesis 2:8–10I think we are going to get many surprises yet on land, and under the sea.Thor Heyerdahl, June 2000Millions of square kilometres of useful human habitat swallowed up by risingsea-levels at the end of the Ice Age. Myths of an antediluvian civilizationdestroyed by global floods. Sightings and rumours of inexplicable submergedstructures in many different parts of the world. Could there be a connection?In order to investigate this problem systematically what I really needed wassome method of correlating the facts about land loss at the end of the Ice Agewith the localities suggested by the myths and with any eye-witness reports ofanomalous underwater structures. I needed, in other words, something like an‘antediluvian Encarta’ – an electronic atlas of the world as it had lookedbefore, during and after the sea-level rise that accompanied the end of the IceAge. Ideally I should be able to see, on demand, any coastline, any island, anyexpanse of ocean, as it had looked at millennium intervals throughout the entireperiod of the meltdown.Such a program, unfortunately, does not exist commercially, nor is informationof the extremely specific kind I needed gathered together in any single work ofreference. Detailed studies of scattered areas are available but nocomprehensive, time-factored global picture. Yet, as I was to discover,cutting-edge research into post-glacial sea-level rise is underway at manyuniversities and the information necessary to create a useful and reasonablyreliable ‘antediluvian atlas’ does in fact exist – though not in published form.Glenn Milne and his colleagues at the Geology Department of Durham Universityare the leading UK specialists in the field and from September 2000 onwards itwas they who came to my rescue. As noted in chapter 1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01], the state-of-the-art computer modelthat they have developed calculates the relevant variables to the extent thatthey are known and produces printable screen images of any location at any epochduring the past 22,000 years. Since the model does not incorporate tectonicmotion and not all its variables are known with great certainty, it is mostaccurate at predicting shoreline changes in tectonically inactive regions andover time intervals of several centuries or more – beyond that, its predictionsare useful as approximate guides. The processing is not instantaneous andskilled man-hours are required to extract the required information from theprogram location by location. So Glenn was kind beyond measure in cheerfully andhelpfully preparing all the inundation maps that are used in the later chaptersof this book.But I had made forays into antediluvian geography before I met Glenn Milne. Thiswas feasible wherever sufficiently detailed sea-level data was accessible tobuild up a sense of how the inundation of a particular region had progressedover a period of several thousands of years. Thanks to the work of Kurt Lambeck,a geologist at the Research School of Earth Sciences of the Australian NationalUniversity, such data has been on public record for the Persian Gulf since 1996.Lambeck’s findings (which I was later able to confirm against Glenn Milne’smodelling of the post-glacial shorelines of the Gulf) were of enormous interestto me because the Persian Gulf was the home of a mysterious and extraordinaryancient culture – the Sumerians. Their flood myths seem to form the archetypefor the much later Noah story in the Old Testament, and they are regarded byarchaeologists as the founders of the oldest high civilization in the world.Inundation data for the end of the last Ice Age has never before been thoughtlikely to have a bearing, one way or another, on the problem of the origins ofcivilization and has therefore never been used as an investigative tool byarchaeologists interested in this problem. But since the relevant data wasavailable for the Persian Gulf, I decided to try to find out what it might show.THE FIVE ANTEDILUVIAN CITIES OF SUMERLocated immediately to the north-west of the present coastline of the Gulfbetween the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, ancient Sumer flourished during thefourth and third millennia BC and the earliest surviving written version of theglobal flood ‘myth’ was found during excavations of the Sumerian city of Nippur1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn1] (located on the Euphrates 200kilometres south of the modern city of Baghdad). Inscribed on a tablet of bakedclay, the Sumerian tradition is accepted by scholars as the source of the laterBabylonian Epic of Gilgamesh2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn2](which likewise speaks of a universal flood that destroyed mankind) and alsobears a close relationship to the much-better-known flood account in the OldTestament.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn3]The Sumerian text is from a fragment – the lower third – of what was once asix-column tablet.4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn4] And while itis clear that it belongs to a very ancient and widely dispersed family of floodtraditions, it nevertheless remains – in itself-a ‘unique and unduplicated’document. ‘Although scholars have been “all eyes and ears” for new [Sumerian]deluge tablets, not a single additional fragment has turned up in any museum,private collection or excavation.’5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn5]What a rare and precious thing this little slab of baked mud is! And what a taleit has to tell. When I first read it I was instantly intrigued, because itcontains explicit references to the existence of five antediluvian cities which,we are informed, were swallowed up by the waters of the flood. If such citiesever existed, then where should we expect to find their ruins today?[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_001_r1.jpg]The first thirty-seven lines of the Sumerian tablet are missing, so we do notknow how the story begins, but at the point where we enter it the flood is stillfar in the future.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn6] We hear aboutthe creation of human beings, animals and plants.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn7] Then another break of thirty-sevenlines occurs after which we find that we have jumped forwards in time to anepoch of high civilization. We learn that in this epoch, before the flood,‘kingship was lowered from heaven’,8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn8] a phrase that is eerilyreminiscent of similar sky-ground symbolism contained in ancient Egyptianscriptures such as the Pyramid Texts (c.2300 BC), the Book of what is in theDuat (c. 1400 BC) and the much later Hermetica (C.AD 300).9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn9]Then comes the reference to the foundation of Sumer’s antediluvian cities by anunnamed ruler or a god:After the lofty crown and the throne of kingship had been lowered from heaven,He perfected the rites and the exalted divine laws …Founded the five cities … in pure places,Called their names, apportioned them as cult centres.The first of these cities, Eridu …The second Badtibira …The third Larak …The fourth Sippar …The fifth Shurrupak …10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn10]‘A FLOOD WILL SWEEP OVER THE CULT CENTRES …’When we rejoin the narrative after a third 37-line lacuna the scene has changedbewilderingly. Although the flood is still in the future, the foundation of thefive antediluvian cities is now far in the past. It is apparent from the contextthat in the intervening period the cities’ inhabitants have behaved in such away as to incur divine displeasure and that a convocation of the gods has beencalled to punish mankind with the terrible instrument of an earth-destroyingflood. At the moment where we pick up the story again a few of the gods aredissenting from this decision and expressing their unhappiness anddissatisfaction with it11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn11]Without preamble, a man called Zisudra is then introduced – the Sumerianarchetype of the biblical patriarch Noah. The text describes him as ‘a pious,god-fearing king’12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn12] and allows usto understand that one of the gods – unnamed – has taken pity on him. The godtells Zisudra:Take my word, give ear to my instructions:A flood will sweep over the cult centres.To destroy the seed of mankind,Is the decision, the word of the assembly of gods.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn13]A text break of forty lines follows, which scholars deduce, from the many laterrecensions of the same myth, ‘must have continued with detailed instructions toZisudra to build a giant boat and thus save himself from destruction’.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn14] When the story resumes thecataclysm has already begun:All the windstorms, exceedingly powerful, attacked as one,At the same time the flood swept over the cult centres.For seven days and seven nights the flood swept over the land,And the huge boat was tossed about by the windstorms on the great waters.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn15]Throughout the cataclysm the skies remain dark. Then, on the eighth day, the sunbreaks through the clouds, and the rains and raging storms cease. From the deckof his survival ship Zisudra looks out over a world that has changed for everand sacrifices an ox and a sheep to the sun-god.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn16]An infuriating lacuna of thirty-nine lines follows, presumably telling us aboutthe place where Zisudra makes landfall and the steps that he takes thereafter.When we pick up the story again, near the end of the text, we find him in thepresence of the high gods of the Sumerian pantheon, An and Enlil, who haverepented of their earlier decision to wipe mankind entirely from the face of theearth and are now so grateful to Zisudra for building his Ark and surviving theflood that they decide to make him immortal:Life like a god they gave him;Breath eternal like a god they brought down for him,… Zisudra the king.The preserver of the name of vegetation and of the seed of mankind.17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn17]The final thirty-nine lines are missing.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn18]PICKING AND CHOOSINGIn his classic book The Sumerians, the late Professor Samuel Noah Kramer, one ofthe great authorities on ancient Sumer, observes that there are ‘tantalizingobscurities and uncertainties’ in this oldest surviving written version of theworldwide tradition of the flood.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn19] What there can be no doubt aboutat all, however, is that the tablet speaks of an urban civilization that existedbefore the flood somewhere in the Persian Gulf area and provides us with thenames of its sacred cities: Eridu, Badtibira, Larak, Sippar, Shurrupak. Thesecities, we are told quite specifically, were swallowed up in the deluge.Moreover, long after Sumerian civilization itself had ceased to exist, a richtradition concerning the five cities, the antediluvian epoch and the floodsurvived in Mesopotamia almost down to Christian times.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn20] Indeed it is fair to say that thetraditional history of this region, as it was told in antiquity, is very clearlydivided into two different periods – before and after the flood – and that bothperiods were regarded by the peoples of the region as absolutely factual andreal.It is only later scholars who have picked and chosen from the histories,accepting half of what they say as the basis for orthodox Sumerian chronologyand rejecting the other half – concerning the antediluvian period – as myth andfantasy. Their logic is that there is no archaeological evidence for any highurban civilization in Sumer earlier than the fourth millennium BC and indeedtheir digs have revealed none.21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn21]Yet, as the cliché goes, absence of evidence is not necessarily to be taken asevidence of absence – and even Kramer obviously had his doubts. In The Sumerianshe recounts how, before 1952, archaeologists were unanimous in their opinionthat Sumer had been uninhabited (and uninhabitable) marshland until about 4500to 4000 BC:This figure was obtained by starting with 2500 BC, an approximate and reasonablyassured date obtained by dead reckoning with the help of written documents. Tothis was added from fifteen hundred to two thousand years, a span of time largeenough to account for the stratigraphical accumulation of all the earliercultural remains down to virgin soil, that is right down to the beginning ofhuman habitation in Sumer.22 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn22]But then, continues Kramer, two geologists, Lees and Falcon, ‘published a paperwhich carried revolutionary implications for the date of Sumer’s firstsettlement’.23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn23] They demonstratedthat Sumer had ceased to be uninhabitable marshland long before 4500–4000 BC.NOW that this was understood:It was not impossible that man had settled there considerably earlier than hadbeen generally assumed. The reason traces of these earliest settlements in Sumerhave not as yet been unearthed, it was argued, may be because the land issinking slowly at the same time that the water-table has been rising. The verylowest level of cultural remains in Sumer may, therefore, now be under water andmay never have been reached by archaeologists, since they would have been misledby the higher water level into believing they had touched virgin soil. If thatshould prove to be true, Sumer’s oldest cultural remains are still buried anduntapped, and the date of Sumer’s very first settlements may have to be pushedback a millennium or so.24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn24]But why only a grudging millennium or so? Once we’ve admitted it is possiblethat archaeologists may never have reached the oldest layers of human habitationin Sumer, why should we assume that further digging might only push the horizonback by a thousand years? Why not five thousand years? Or ten thousand years?What is this worship of the recent that archaeologists indulge in?The reason I ask these questions with a certain amount of exasperation is thatKramer, whose work has influenced several generations of students, does not fora moment consider the possibility that Sumer’s antediluvian traditions might bebased on anything real at all. Indeed, he devotes only three pages of his bookto the prehistory of this ancient land before giving thirty pages to thehistoric period – as though all of the former is nothing more than a preamble tothe latter.I’m very struck by the extent to which Kramer relies on original Sumeriansources to build up his chronology of rulers, which begins, he says, with:The first dynasty of Sumer whose existence can be historically attested, theso-called First Dynasty of Kish, which according to the ancients themselvesfollowed immediately upon the subsidence of the Flood … The first ruler of Sumerwhose deeds are recorded is a king by the name of Etana of Kish, who may havecome to the throne quite early in the third millennium BC25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn25]It is in precisely this way that every Sumerian text about the period after theflood is treated as grist to the mill by historians constructing chronologieswhile every Sumerian text about the period before the flood is relegated to therealm of the mythologists …SO LITTLE TO GO ONKramer’s recognition, with the geologists Lees and Falcon, that people couldhave settled in the fertile valley between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers muchearlier than had previously been assumed has been entirely vindicated bysubsequent discoveries of the traces of ‘primitive agricultural villages’ datingback more than 8000 years.26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn26]But the clues that have come down to us from this remote period are scanty andoften ambiguous.For example, with a tiny evidence base, are archaeologists absolutely certainthat they could tell the difference between a small group of ‘primitive’ farmersand a small group of shattered and demoralized survivors from an urbancivilization destroyed in a terrible flood?27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn27] Not a river-flood, no matter howbig … but a real marine flood, deep and wild and sweeping in over the land,carrying all before it like the one described in the story of Zisudra.WOOLLEY’S DELUGEIt is a river flood that has traditionally been suggested by scholars as theevent described in the Zisudra text.28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn28] This goes back to the excavationsof the renowned British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley at the Sumerian cityof Ur in 1922–9. Digging inspection trenches through thousands of years ofhabitation layers, he suddenly reached a layer of silt almost 3 metres deepwhich he described as ‘perfectly clean clay, uniform throughout, the texture ofwhich showed that it had been laid there by water’.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn29] The silt itself was void ofhabitation evidence, but there were further habitation layers below it that hedated to 3200 BC.30 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn30]Woolley declared that he had found the first concrete proof of the cataclysmdescribed in the Zisudra story and the biblical flood of Noah and added:The discovery that there was a real deluge to which the Sumerian and the Hebrewstories of the Flood alike go back does not of course prove any single detail ineither of those stories. This deluge was not universal, but a local disasterconfined to the lower valley of the Tigris and Euphrates, affecting an areaperhaps 400 miles long and 100 miles across; but for the occupants of the valleythat was the whole world!31 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn31]Woolley may not have been right that the inhabitants of the Tigris/Euphratesriver valley thought of it as the ‘whole world’ but he needed to see them asgeographically naive in order to explain why they had described his ‘localdisaster’ as a ‘universal’ flood that threatened the survival of mankind as awhole. Neither was he necessarily right about the riverine nature of his siltlayer; other, more recent, voices have suggested that it may have been laid downa few hundred years earlier than he suggested and that the agency is more likelyto have been a massive transgression of the sea, followed by a gradual retreatof the waters with deposition of silt, than the work of the Tigris andEuphrates.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn32]RISING SEASIn the 1990s Kurt Lambeck of the Australian National University carried out adetailed study of the Persian Gulf in order to map and simulate its‘palaeo-shorelines’ from 18,000 ago – around the end of the Last GlacialMaximum-right up to today. He calculates that the modern shoreline of the regionwas reached shortly before 6000 years ago, and exceeded as relative sea-levelrose 1–2 metres above its present level, inundating the low-lying areas of lowerMesopotamia.33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn33]This marine transgression, which occurred between approximately 6000 and 5500years ago, flooded the coastal plains of Sumer and extended the northwesternshoreline of the Gulf to the doorsteps of Eridu and Ur – where the rising watersmay have temporarily peaked as high as 3 metres above today’s level beforereceding.34 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn34] Geneticist Dr StephenOppenheimer, who has made a special study of floods and ancient migrations,suggests that this could have been the event that left behind the thickinundation deposit that Leonard Woolley excavated at Ur – not a river-flood atall as Woolley had believed, but a marine flood.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn35]In his important book Eden in the East Oppenheimer argues that what happened inthe Gulf at this time, between approximately 6000 and 5500 years ago (4000–3500BC), was the local effect of a worldwide episode of rapid, relatively short-termflooding known as the Flandrian transgression – which had a significant impactnot only along the shores of the Gulf but in many other parts of Asia as well.36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn36] Noting that ‘the destructiveeffect of the Flandrian transgression in wiping out coastal archaeological sitesup to about 5500 years ago is now well recognized,’ he launches the interestingspeculation that in the case of Sumer:Eridu may be the oldest coastal city not destroyed by the invading sea. In otherwords it could have been the last old city to be built at the post-glacial highwater point.37 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn37]Likewise, the distinguished Sumeriologist Georges Roux argues that between 6000and 5000 years ago the shoreline of the Gulf was approximately 1 or 2 metresabove its present level, so that its north-western coast lay ‘in the vicinity ofUr and Eridu’. Thereafter, ‘gradual regression, combined with silting from therivers, brought it to where it is now’.38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn38]ERIDUSo I was back to the mystery of the antediluvian cities again and how they couldpossibly have been ‘swept over by the flood’, as the Zisudra story claimed, whenEridu had so obviously survived into historical times. In fact, as I was soon tolearn, all the antediluvian cities had survived into historical times; none ofthem was presently underwater and at least one of them – Eridu – appeared neverto have been underwater!Between 1946 and 1949 Eridu’s ruins, located in the south of Sumer near theEuphrates, a little to the north and west of the modern city of Basra,39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn39] were thoroughly excavated by ateam from the Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities led by Fuad Safar.40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn40] The archaeologists paidparticular attention to the temple of Enki, the Sumerian god of wisdom andEridu’s tutelary deity.41 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn41] Herethey dug a deep trench through many different layers of construction andreconstruction from about 2500 BC down until they finally reached the temple’svery first building phase. Originally thought to have dated to about 4000 BC42[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn42] – itself an epoch of fabulousantiquity – the excavators kept finding older and older material.The central structure of the site is its principal ziggurat – step-pyramid-whichwas erected around 2030 BC by a Sumerian king named Amar Sin.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn43] But it, too, turned out to standon top of a series of earlier structures. Under one of its corners thearchaeologists unearthed the ruins of no less than seventeen temples,built one above the other in proto-historic times. The lowest and earliest ofthese temples (Levels XVII-XV) were small, one roomed buildings which containedaltars, offering tables and a fine-quality pottery decorated with elaborate,often elegant geometric designs.44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn44]Judging by the pottery, these earliest shrines of Eridu go back much furtherthan 4000 BC and probably as far as 5000 BC – i.e. 7000 years ago.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn45] That, says Georges Roux, makes‘Eridu one of the most ancient settlements in southern Iraq’ and a ‘remarkable’choice in the mythology as the oldest of the antediluvian cities.46[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn46]There therefore seems to be no dispute that there was a settlement of some sorthere before the region was flooded by the Flandrian transgression around 5500years ago. Yet the excavations, which only stopped when the archaeologistsreached ‘virgin soil’, ‘yielded no trace of a flood’.47[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn47] How could that be explained in anantediluvian city supposedly inundated not just by any old flood but by theflood? And how was I to make sense of the fact that ancient Ur, less than 20kilometres away and on slightly higher ground,48[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn48] was not even named in the floodtradition and yet did show evidence of a severe, silt-bearing inundation?In 1992 Jules Zarins, a geologist at Southwest Missouri State University,suggested a possible solution to this problem. In a paper published in theJournal of the American Oriental Society, he showed that in spite of Eridu’slocation in a low-lying depression south-west of Ur ‘an eight-metre scarp of theUpper Fars formation (the Hazim) runs well to the north and south, possiblyblocking any marine infilling into the depression’.49[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn49] Now I was better equipped tounderstand what Oppenheimer and Roux were getting at. Looking at a map of thevalley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, I could easily see how the relativelysmall and temporary increase in sea-level associated with the Flandriantransgression could have flooded low-lying areas of ancient Sumer – in fact upto about 180 kilometres inland50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn50]-in what are now Iran, Kuwait andIraq. This would have brought the northern shoreline of the Persian Gulf veryclose to Eridu while quite conceivably carrying it just beyond Ur, thus leavingbehind the flood deposit that Woolley had found.51[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn51][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_002_r1.jpg]SHURRUPAK AND SIPPARThe archaeological results at the antediluvian city of Shurrupak, about 100kilometres north of Eridu on the Euphrates river, also show evidence of a floodin the form of ‘sizeable deposits of water-borne clay and sand due to a majorand prolonged inundation’.52 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn52]Since Shurrupak was renowned as the birthplace of Zisudra, the Sumerian Noah whohad ‘preserved the seed of mankind’,53[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn53] I thought at first that thismight be a promising lead. But it fizzled out. The Shurrupak flood was securelydated to 4900 years ago – probably six or seven hundred years later than theflood recorded at Ur – and was almost certainly riverine.54[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn54]Dedicated to the sun-god Utu,55 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn55]Sippar is the furthest inland of all the antediluvian cities and plays a specialrole in the Sumerian flood story. In fragment 4a of the few scattered remnantsof the once widely renowned History of the Babylonian priest Berossos (who wrotein the third century BC but whose work is thought by scholars to conveyauthentic Sumerian traditions),56 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn56]Sippar is remembered as the place where the knowledge of the antediluvian racewas hidden away before the flood and preserved for use by the survivors ofmankind.The Noah figure in this version of the story is named Xisouthros (instead ofZisudra). A god visits him in a dream, warns him that humanity is about to bedestroyed in a terrible deluge, and orders him to build a huge boat of the usualdimensions in the usual way.57 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn57] Sofar this is all very familiar, but then comes a feature not found in the otherversions of the tradition. The god tells Xisouthros that he is to gather up acollection of precious tablets inscribed with sacred wisdom and to bury these ina safe place deep underground in ‘Sippar, the City of the Sun’.58[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn58] These tablets contained ‘all theknowledge that humans had been given by the gods’ and Xisouthros was to preservethem so that those men and women who survived the flood would be able to‘relearn all that the gods had previously taught them’.59[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn59]The story of the flood itself is then given and of the journey of Xisouthros andhis protégés in the Ark. Immediately after they make landfall Xisouthros stepsdown from the great ship, offers a sacrifice to the gods and thenvanishes-having been transported immediately to immortal life. Those whoremained on board are now leaderless and confused until a voice is heard fromthe heavens telling them to sail the ship back towards Babylon and to seek outthe city of Sippar, which will have survived the flood. They are to ‘dig up thetablets that were buried there and turn them over to mankind’:60[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn60]And those who had arrived in Babylonia dug up the tablets in the city of Sipparand brought them out. They built many cities and erected temples to the gods andrenewed Babylon.61 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn61]AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGA quick inventory shows that we have so far identified three cities in thePersian Gulf area called Sippar, Shurrupak and Eridu in the historical periodand three counterpart cities with exactly the same names which tradition saysexisted before the flood. We have Ur, very close to Eridu, which is not spokenof as an antediluvian city but which clearly suffered a major episode offlooding that laid down almost 3 metres of silt around the middle of the fourthmillennium BC. We have Shurrupak, which was also inundated but not until about700 years later. Meanwhile Sippar, the northernmost and farthest from today’sGulf coast of the five antediluvian cities, is named in the Berossos text as aplace where it would have been practical for documents buried before the floodto be retrieved after the waters had subsided.The remaining two antediluvian cities of the Sumerian tradition – Badtibira andLarak – have also been identified with archaeological sites in Iraq;62[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn62] however (as indeed is the casewith Sippar, Shurrupak and Eridu as well), these sites are not particularlylarge, splendid or significant as one might expect of such sanctified ground. AsWilliam Hallo of Yale University comments, ‘The cities in question are notoutstanding in importance … They are distinguished, rather, for theirantiquity.’63 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn63]Since excavations at Eridu found the earliest occupation layers to have beenlaid down as much as 7000 years ago the city is indeed technically‘antediluvian’ (by more than 1000 years) with respect to the Flandriantransgression – and the same is already known to be the case at Ur, whereWoolley’s excavators found habitation traces not only above the flood layer butalso below it.On the face of things, then, it seems reasonable to agree – and many scholarsfrom Woolley onwards have agreed – that it was this flood at this time, or atany rate one of the frequent large-scale floods both riverine and marine towhich the region was much prone in antiquity, that must have given rise to theSumerian flood tradition. The new evidence revealing the extent of the floodingof southern Mesopotamia between approximately 4000 and 3500 BC – just on theedge of the historical period – should, if anything, have strengthened thishypothesis.So why didn’t I feel comfortable with it?HEYERDAHL ON SUMERThe floods that had been archaeologically testified in the valley of the LowerEuphrates and Tigris took place too soon after the date for the foundation ofEridu and the other ‘antediluvian’ cities to fit in with the sense of grandeurand vast age that the traditions conveyed. When I looked again at the story ofZisudra, the story of the Babylonian flood hero Atrahasis,64[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn64] the Epic of Gilgamesh,65[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn65] the fragments of Berossos, andnumerous other recensions and variants, I found that all of them set theantediluvian city-building period in the frame of vast expanses of time –frequently running into tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands ofyears.66 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn66] While I could understandwhy William Hallo felt that ‘this chronology, measured in millennia, isobviously fantastic,’67 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn67] I foundhis own proposed chronology equally absurd. ‘Mesopotamian urbanism,’ he arguedin the prestigious Journal of Cuneiform Studies, ‘was only some two centuriesold at the time of the flood …’68 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn68]In June 2000 I met the explorer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl, then eighty-sixyears old, at the excavation of a group of step-pyramids on Tenerife in theCanary Islands. We spent the afternoon together, under the blazing sun,exploring the site that he had brought to world attention.Heyerdahl was everything I had expected him to be – impatient with protocol, apowerful presence, with piercing blue eyes, endearing vanities, a bawdy sense ofhumour, and an open, inquiring, restless mind. His Tigris expedition in 1977,which had begun in the Persian Gulf and culminated in Djibouti in the Horn ofAfrica, had proved that the reed boats of ancient Mesopotamia were sufficientlyseaworthy and technically advanced to make long-distance marine voyages.Evidence of trans-oceanic trade at the very beginning of Sumerian historysuggested very strongly that they had indeed made such voyages as early as thefourth millennium BC – and perhaps even earlier. Moreover, whereverarchaeologists excavate they find amidst the ruins of Sumer’s most ancientcities all the signs of a civilization that was already highly evolved,accomplished and sophisticated when those cities were founded more than 5500years ago.‘Now we know that man is more than two million years old,’ exclaimed Heyerdahl,‘it would be very strange if our ancestors lived like primitive food collectorsfor all that time until suddenly they started in the Nile valley, in Mesopotamiaand even in the Indus valley, to build a civilization at peak level pretty muchat the same time. And there’s a question I ask that I never get an answer to.The tombs from the first kingdom of Sumer are full of beautiful ornaments andtreasures made of gold, silver, platinum, and semi-precious stones – things youdon’t find in Mesopotamia. All you find there is mud and water – good forplanting but not much else. How did they suddenly learn – in that one generationjust about – where to go to find gold and all these other things? To do thatthey must have known the geography of wide areas, and that takes time. So theremust have been something before.’I pointed out that the First Dynasty of Sumer defined itself as the firstdynasty after the flood. The historical Sumerians had always believed that theirhistory was connected to an earlier episode of city-building and civilized lifethat had begun many thousands of years in the past and from which this delugeseparated them. ‘We’re coming to a controversial idea,’ I suggested, ‘which isthat the great civilizations of historical antiquity may have received some kindof legacy from an antediluvian culture – an idea orthodox archaeologistsdetest.’‘I know that,’ Heyerdahl replied, ‘but I mean they cannot give any answer to howcould the Sumerians five thousand years ago know where to go and find thesedifferent kinds of raw material. They must have known the world. So, and I meanit, it is for me almost as fantastic as Erich Von Daniken who brought in peoplefrom space, to say as the archaeologists do – oh no, no, they sat in Egypt andMesopotamia and the Indus valley, and they decided, bang, suddenly, just likethat, we are going to build pyramids, we are going to go and find gold and weare going to do all this … It’s ridiculous. I say it straight out – it could notbe possible.’‘The idea of a lost civilization drives archaeologists mad and they seem to wantto stop people thinking about it.’‘Well I understand why! Too many people have brought this up together withfairytale stories …’‘Which has put the historians off, so that they simply never explore this kindof question?’‘Yes, and this is a great pity. Because I mean even the sunken Atlantis story,which they all dismiss, is interesting – because why did the early Greeks writethis story and why did they get it from the Egyptians, and for that matter whydoes every civilized and half-civilized nation in the world talk about theflood? Don’t let us throw it away until we know that this is impossible. Therehas to be a possibility … and I think that we should look for it with the moderntechnical means we have. I think we are going to get many surprises yet on land,and under the sea.’NO SURPRISES: WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAY ABOUT ‘BEFORE’Heyerdahl had arrived at his misgivings about the orthodox chronology of Sumerbecause he felt that it did not allow time for the evolution and development ofthe advanced urban civilization that archaeologists now knew had flourishedthere from the fourth millennium BC. ‘There has to have been something before,’he reminded me when we parted. ‘Look for whatever was before.’Of course, there had been something before – a well-worked-out stratigraphicalsequence that traced the development of human civilization in Mesopotamia backthrough ‘proto-history’ before the early dynastic period and thence into theNeolithic, Mesolithic and even the Palaeolithic epochs – a long, gradual,unsurprising process spread out over 30,000 years that Georges Roux sums up as‘from cave to farm and from village to city’.69[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn69]At risk of grossly abbreviating the painstaking archaeological work that hasgradually uncovered this sequence, here are a few of the main mileposts:Shanidar Cave in the Kurdish mountains of what is now northern Iraq: occupied byNeanderthal man c.50,000 years ago to 46,000 years ago; occupied by anatomicallymodern Upper Palaeolithic humans around 34,000 years ago; occupied by Mesolithicpeoples around 11,000 years ago.70[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn70]Jarmo, also in northern Iraq – a Neolithic agricultural site which may perhapsdate as early as 8750 years ago. It has a 7 metre high artificial mound restingon top of a very steep hill and is formed of sixteen layers of superimposedhabitations.71 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn71]Hassuna, again in northern Iraq (35 kilometres south of Mosul). The firstsettlement here has the appearance of a more primitive Neolithic farmingcommunity living in huts or tents. Overlying this layer archaeologists found sixlayers of houses, progressively larger and better built.72[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn72]Umm Dabaghiya – about 8000 years old: more sophisticated features found,including beautiful murals and floors made out of large clay slabs ‘carefullyplastered with gypsum and frequently painted red’.73[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn73]The Samarra period – named after a widespread pottery style created by what Rouxdescribes as ‘a hitherto unsuspected culture which flourished in the MiddleTigris valley during the second half of the sixth millennium BC’-i.e.approximately 7500 years ago.74 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn74]The geneticist Luca Cavalli-Sforza suggests that this date should be pushed backto ‘about 8000 years ago’.75 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn75]There is evidence that this culture used irrigation techniques, grew largesurpluses of wheat, barley and linseed, and built spacious houses out ofmud-brick76 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn76] – later the favouredmethod of construction in the cities and temples of historical Sumer.As well as Samarra several other ‘proto-historical’ cultural phases have beenidentified in which elements of Sumer’s future civilization can be witnessedtaking shape in increasingly organized and recognizable forms. Two of thesephases stand out prominently in the archaeological record – the ‘Ubaid’ period(roughly 7200 to about 5500 years ago77[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn77] and including the first temple atEridu),78 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn78] and the ‘Uruk’ period(6000 years ago79 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn79] down to about5200 years ago, showing further developments in the evolution of templearchitecture).80 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn80] The Uruk period,which some archaeologists prefer to see as a subdivision of the Ubaid,81[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn81] then merges fairly seamlesslyinto the early dynastic period of Sumer.82[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn82]All of the above dates are of course approximate and are subject to processes ofcontinuous revision and refinement by scholars. Nevertheless, they are thoughtlikely to be accurate to within about 300 years.83[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn83] In general the academics alsoagree that the direction of the ‘flow’ of the urban lifestyle in Mesopotamia isfrom north to south – with the first village-style settlements and large housesestablished in the north before being seen in the south. However, andparadoxically, Sumerian civilization as a distinctive entity, the origins ofwhich archaeologists now trace back at least as far as the Ubaid period if notfurther, appears to be a phenomenon that had its origins in southernMesopotamia. According to Georges Roux:During the fourth millennium BC the cultural development already perceptibleduring the Ubaid period proceeded at a quicker pace and the Sumeriancivilization finally blossomed. This, however, took place only in the southernhalf of Iraq, the northern half following a different course and lagging behindin many respects.84 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn84]The word ‘Sumerian’ is derived from Shumer, the ancient name of southern Iraq.85[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn85] Archaeologists believe that theyhave distinguished the presence of three distinct ethnic groups living in closecontact in this region at the dawn of history around 5000 years ago. These were:the Sumerians, predominant in the extreme south from approximately Nippur [nearmodern Diwaniyah] to the Gulf, the Semites, predominant in central Mesopotamia(the region called Akkad after 2400 BC), and a small, diffuse minority ofuncertain origin to which no definite label can be attached.86[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn86]Apparently, the only distinguishing features of these three groups are theirlanguages.87 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn87] Otherwise:All of them had the same institutions; all of them shared the way of life, thetechniques, the artistic traditions, the religious beliefs, in a word thecivilization which had originated in the extreme south and is rightly attributedto the Sumehans.88 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn88]THE SUMERIAN PROBLEMWith so much known about the evolution and development of the magnificent urbancivilization of Sumer, it comes as a surprise to discover that there is such athing as ‘the Sumerian problem’.89[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn89] I prefer to let the scholarsspeak for themselves:Who are these Sumerians? Do they represent a very ancient layer of population inprehistoric Mesopotamia, or did they come from some other country, and if so,when did they come and whence? This important point has been debated again andagain ever since the first relics of the Sumerian civilization were brought tolight more than a century ago. The most recent discoveries, far from offering asolution, have made it even more difficult to answer …90[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn90]And there is a mystery about the Sumerian language. It can be read and studiedbecause later civilizations, such as the Babylonians, kept archives of Sumeriantexts and also helpfully translated them into their own languages. However,Sumerian has a distinct peculiarity. It is unrelated to any of the knownlanguage families of the world.91 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn91]So although there is a real sense in which Sumer and its precocious urbanculture fit in very nicely with long-term developmental trends in ancientMesopotamia – as I believe the scholars have successfully demonstrated – thereis also a sense in which the Sumerians are definitely a bit different, a bitspecial … and conspicuously attached to the south …I’ve been dealing with archaeologists long enough now to realize that they don’tlike myths or traditions very much (‘can’t weigh ’em, can’t measure ’em, can’tcarbon-date ’em’). I was therefore not surprised to learn that they discountedwhat the Sumerians themselves had to say about their own origins:Sumerian literature presents us with the picture of a highly intelligent,industrious, argumentative and deeply religious people, but offers no clue as toits origins [emphasis added]. Sumerian myths and legends are almost invariablydrawn against a background of rivers and marshes, of reeds, tamarisks andpalm-trees – a typical southern Iraqi background – as though the Sumerians hadalways lived in that country, and there is nothing in them to indicate clearlyan ancestral homeland different from Mesopotamia.92[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn92]But, as we have seen, the Sumerians had very clear ideas about their own origins… In their myths and legends they remembered a time, before the flood, when theyhad lived in five great cities. And they remembered a deluge so ferocious thatit threatened the existence of all mankind …THE SEVEN SAGES: WHAT THE SUMERIANS SAID ABOUT ‘BEFORE …’Sumerian myths and legends of the antediluvian world do much more than speak ofthe five cities. They also tell an extraordinary story of how their ancestors,who lived in the ‘most ancient times’, were visited by a brotherhood ofsemi-divine beings described as half men, half fish, who had been ‘sent [by thegods] to teach the arts of civilization to mankind before the Flood’ and who hadthemselves ‘emerged from the sea’. The collective name by which these creatureswere known was the ‘Seven Sages’ and the name of their leader was Oannes. Eachof them was paired as a ‘counsellor’ to an antediluvian king and they wererenowned for their wisdom in affairs of state and for their skills asarchitects, builders and engineers.93[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn93][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_003_r1.jpg]Fish-garbed figure taken from stone relief on Assyrian temple, possiblyrepresenting Oannes, leader of the Seven Sages.The priest Berossos compiled his History from the temple archives of Babylon(reputed to have contained ‘public records’ that had been preserved for ‘over150,000 years’).94 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn94] He has passedon to us a description of Oannes as a ‘monster’, or a ‘creature’. However, whatBerossos has to say-ridiculous though this may sound – is surely more suggestiveof a man wearing some sort of fish-costume. There is also a geographical anomalyin the text that may prove worthy of further consideration:There appeared from the Red Sea in an area bordering on Babylonia a frighteningmonster, named Oannes … It had the whole body of a fish, but underneath andattached to the head of the fish there was another head, human, and joined tothe tail of the fish, feet like those of a man, and it had a human voice. Itsform has been preserved in sculpture to this day …This monster spent its days with men, never eating anything, but teaching menthe skills necessary for writing and for doing mathematics and for all sorts ofknowledge: how to build cities, found temples, and make laws. It taught men howto determine borders and divide land, also how to plant seeds and then toharvest their fruits and vegetables. In short, it taught men all those thingsconducive to a civilized life. Since that time nothing further has beendiscovered. At the end of the day, this monster, Oannes, went back to the seaand spent the night. It was amphibious, able to live both on land and in the sea… Later, other monsters similar to Oannes appeared.95[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn95]DID THEY COME FROM THE EAST?In 1944 Benno Landsberger, one of the great Sumerian scholars of the twentiethcentury, commented in an obscure essay that in his opinion:The legend of the Seven Sages who, emerging from the sea, imparted all technicalskills and all knowledge to the Babylonians, may quite possibly have somehistorical basis.96 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn96]What he had in mind here was ‘the Sumerian problem’ – i.e. the as yet unansweredquestion: where did the Sumerians come from? Earlier than most archaeologists,he fully understood that ‘the essential civilizing process on Mesopotamian soilmust be ascribed to the pre-Sumerian population’. But at the same time theSumerians were distinctively different and much more advanced than theirimmediate neighbours in terms of the level of development of their intellectualand philosophical ideas. ‘In the area of intellectual culture,’ he wrote, ‘onlythe Sumerians possessed creative powers.’97[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn97]In fact they were so different in this respect that Landsberger was convincedthey must have been migrants from somewhere else. He felt that only such amigration could account for the creation of the unique and idiosyncratic earlydynastic culturewhich is considered to be so specifically Sumerian and which in its latermanifestations indeed represented the Sumerian essence in its purest state. Inall probability the Sumerians came from the East. Not only does the density ofthe settlement indicate a settling from south to north, but the absence ofSumerian elements in the mountain ranges north and east of Babylonia favors thethesis that the Sumerians came across the sea.98[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn98]In further support of his thesis Landsberger pointed out that the island ofBahrain, in the south of the Persian Gulf near Qatarpossessed deities with authentic Sumerian names such as the chief god En-zak andhis spouse Me-skil-ak. This circumstance supports an overseas origin for theSumerians, since it is improbable that the island was colonized from southernMesopotamia.99 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn99]Landsberger went on to speculate that the spark of Sumerian genius might havebeen imported from the Indus Valley civilization across the Arabian Sea to theeast,100 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn100] an interesting idea initself. However, because he was writing in the 1940s he did not have access tomodern knowledge about the astonishing changes that took place in the PersianGulf at the end of the last Ice Age. He was thus unable to consider a far moreradical possibility that the new science has revealed.EXPLOSIVE IMPLICATIONSKurt Lambeck’s work on the Persian Gulf initially drew my attention because itspoke of a marine flooding incident – the Flandrian transgression between about6000 and 5500 years ago – that temporarily shifted the northern coast of theGulf more than 150 kilometres inland and made Ur and Eridu beachfront property.Lambeck’s study was published in 1996 in the Earth and Planetary ScienceLetters, a specialist geological journal that probably does not cross the desksof a great many archaeologists.101[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn101] He had focused on the periodfrom 18,000 years ago – around the peak of the last glaciation – until today andhad taken into account all the key variables includingthe response of the earth to glacial unloading of the distant ice sheets and tothe meltwater loading of the Gulf itself and the adjacent ocean. Models forthese glacio-isostatic effects have been compared with observations of sea-levelchange, and palaeoshoreline reconstructions of the Gulf have been made.102[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn102]Now, as I looked more closely into Lambeck’s research, I realized that it couldhave unexplored and potentially explosive implications for the prehistory ofSumer:From the peak of the glaciation until about 14,000 yr BP [years before thepresent] the Gulf is free of marine influence out to the edge of the Biabanshelf. By 14,000 yr BP the Strait of Hormuz had opened up as a narrow waterwayand by about 12,500 years ago the marine incursion into the Central Basin hadstarted. The Western Basin flooded about 1000 years later. Momentary standstillsmay have occurred during the Gulf flooding phase at about 11,300 and 10,500 yrBP…In other words the whole of the Persian Gulf – in fact to a point well beyondthe Strait of Hormuz in what is now the Gulf of Oman – was dry land between18,000 and 14,000 years ago. Only then did the sea begin to transgress into theGulf itself, first as a narrow waterway, later as a recurrent cycle of powerfulshort-lived floods, each followed by a partial recession of the floodwaters,then a standstill, then renewed flooding at irregular intervals.I knew from my first encounter with Lambeck’s research that the presentshoreline of the Gulf had been reached, and then temporarily exceeded, around5500 years ago during the Flandrian transgression. But what I had notimmediately understood was the extraordinary geological drama that had unfoldedbetween 14,000 years ago, when the Gulf first began to flood, and 7000 yearsago, when the city-state of Eridu was established at the north-western end ofthe Gulf and, along with it, the way of life that would soon flower as Sumeriancivilization.THE FLOOR OF THE GULFLambeck himself was convinced that there must be some connection between theflooding of the Gulf and ‘the Sumerian problem’:The early record is incomplete and numerous questions have been raised. Who werethe Sumerians, where did they come from? When did they arrive? Did they arrivefrom a mountainous region beyond Iran or did they arrive by sea? Were theydescendants from earlier Neolithic settlers in the region, from the Ubaidculture at 4500–3500 BC or from the even earlier Eridu culture at about 5000 BC[archaeologists often refer to the Eridu culture as ‘Ubaid I’ – i.e. theearliest stage of the Ubaid culture].103[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn103] Whatever directions the searchfor answers to such questions may take, a significant element in the puzzle mustbe the evolution of the physical environment of the Gulf itself.104[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn104]The last observation sounded particularly relevant to my concerns; however,Lambeck went on to qualify it by suggesting that the only epoch that historiansand archaeologists really need to pay attention to is ‘the latter period of theflooding of the Gulf and the subsequent flooding of the low-lying delta region[the Flandrian transgression] when sea-level rose perhaps a few metres above itspresent level between 6000 and 3000 yr BP’.105[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn105] If archaeologists wereinterested in the earlier period between 18,000 years ago down to as recently as7000 years ago – when a large part of the Gulf floor was still dry land – thenthey should focus on its role as a corridor of migration: ‘a natural route forpeople moving westwards from east of Iran. Is this the route travelled by theancestors of the Sumerians?’106 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn106]What Lambeck did not do, anywhere in his paper, was invite consideration ofanother possibility, even though it is suggested by some of his own data. Thisis the possibility that the dry floor of the Gulf could itself have been a placeof permanent settlement at some point during the 11,000 years between 18,000 and7000 years ago.If it was, then why shouldn’t an urban culture have evolved here, just as themyths of the antediluvian cities suggest?After all, orthodox archaeology has already accepted the existence of veryancient cities elsewhere in the Middle East – such as Catal Huyuk in Turkey (atleast 8500 years old), Jericho in Palestine (more than 10,000 years old)107[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn107] and, indeed, Eridu inMesopotamia (where, as we’ve seen, the oldest shrines are thought to be about7000 years old). Knowing the inundation history of the Gulf as well as we nowdo, therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the ruins of cities thatare literally ‘antediluvian’ could be concealed beneath its increasinglypolluted, industrialized and militarized waters …[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_004_r1.jpg]Dotted line represents projected course of Tigris-Euphrates through thePalaeo-Gulf.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_005_r1.jpg]In these and all inundation maps in this book, the black lines represent moderncoastlines, the light tint is land and the dark tint is sea.A RIVER RAN THROUGH ITDuring the period from the Last Glacial Maximum until about 10,000 years ago theIce Age world was generally colder and more arid than it is today, with averagetemperatures depressed by several degrees even in tropical and equatorial zones.However, these conditions are likely to have been much less severe within themicro-region of the antediluvian Gulf – essentially a large, well-protected,low-lying valley.108 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn108]Its notable feature, which undoubtedly would have been a magnet for life of allsorts including human beings – was that the Tigris and the Euphrates flowedthrough it, united as a single mighty river.109[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn109] The river’s course seems to haverun along the northern side of the valley and at different periods appears tohave passed through as many as three large, freshwater lakes in the Gulf’sWestern and Central and Eastern Basins.110[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn110] It exited the Gulf through thenarrows now known as the Strait of Hormuz and formed its delta on the BiabanShelf to the east.111 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn111] The deltawas relatively small for such a large river, which suggests to scientists thatit must have dumped most of its load of fertile alluvial silt in and around theshores of the lakes that it filled along the way.112[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn112] Over thousands of years thiswould have created areas of great natural fertility within the valley whereagriculture, if practised, might have been extremely productive.For a while things could only get better and, despite the remorseless advance ofthe sea after the Strait of Hormuz was breached 14,000 years ago, conditions inthe rest of the Gulf may for a long while have remained extremely pleasant. Iwas particularly interested to learn of a comprehensive study done in 1988 bythe COHMAP group which showed that ‘the Indian monsoon system penetrated intothe southern and eastern portions of south-west Asia during the period of 12,000to 9000 years ago, and then retreated’.113[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn113] The implication was thatthroughout this period the Gulf, along with other parts of south-west Asia,would haveenjoyed both winter rains and in some areas also summer rains or ephemeralsummer storms. This rainfall would have increased grazing opportunities,particularly in semiarid areas, but would have had little effect on the growthof winter cereals that formed a principal base of early agriculture.114[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn114]A protected valley … a great river … lakes … fertile soils … bountiful rainfall…The palaeo-climatological literature left me with the distinct impression thatthe Gulf around 10,000 or 12,000 years ago could have been a very unusual place… indeed a secret garden blessed with an ideal climate, offering nearly optimumconditions for the emergence of a civilization.A SEA CHANGEWhat changed everything was the sea. As Lambeck tells it:By 14,000 yr BP the Hormuz Strait has opened up as a narrow waterway and theflooding of the lowlands to the west begins, first with the flooding of theEastern Basin by marine water soon after 13,000 BP. Marine influence is firstexperienced in the Central Basin before about 12,500 BP … The Western Basin lakeremains free from marine incursion until about 11,500 BP. The northern part ofthe Gulf remains dry at this time, as does a vast area south of the palaeo-Gulf,although this plain contains numerous shallow topographic depressions. Untilabout 11,000 BP the northern part of the Persian Gulf floor would have been arelatively flat but narrow plain, hemmed in between the palaeo-Gulf and thesouthern foothills of the Zagros mountains forming the present coastline.As the sea-level rises the Gulf continues to expand and the marine influencespreads into the northern region. By about 10,000 BP the north-east margin ofthe Gulf has approached its present position in several localities, particularlyeast of about 52 degrees longitude. Much of the southern part of the Gulfremains exposed until about 8000 BP and areas such as the Great Pearl Bank arenot submerged until shortly after this time.115[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn115]I have deliberately chosen not to summarize Lambeck’s blow-by-blow account ofthe flooding of the Gulf, but to let him speak for himself. He does notdramatize or interpret his data but presents it neutrally, without speculation,as a good scientist should.I am not a scientist and I have a different approach. What I see here is firstand foremost a mystery – the mystery of Sumerian origins – ‘the Sumerianproblem’ as archaeologists like to call it. When I look closer I find that notonly do we not know where the Sumerians came from but also that their languageis unique in the world – apparently unrelated to any other known language.Closer up still and I learn that the Sumerians preserved traditions of aterrible flood that had nearly obliterated mankind from the earth and that hadinundated the five antediluvian cities of their ancestral homeland. There hadbeen survivors in a great ship who had been carried by the floodwaters toanother land and had settled there in order to renew the ruined earth, replenishthe seed of mankind, and preserve the ancient wisdom and the worship of thegods. For this reason those who later traced their line and religion from thesesurvivors always remembered history as being divided into two periods – beforeand after the flood – and recorded the dynasties of their rulers in exactly thesame way-with the list of the historical kings preceded by the list of theantediluvian kings, the latter reigning for a very long period.116[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn116]I review the archaeological literature for rational explanations of the Sumerianflood tradition and find that most of the experts agree it must have been rootedin some kind of historical truth; they point to the temporary inundation of Uraround 5500 years ago, either by gigantic river floods or by the marineincursion known as the Flandrian transgression. But when I look further and tryto match up the details of the flood tradition to the archaeological facts Ifind that nothing really fits; nevertheless there are strange resonances betweenthe evidence and the myths.For example, we’ve seen that Eridu, always named as the first and oldest of theantediluvian cities, was never flooded; yet the archaeological evidence doesmake it a strong contender, with its 7000-year-old shrines to the water-godEnki, for the title of ‘oldest’ Sumerian city.Conversely, Ur, which is not mentioned in the flood tradition at all, was mostdefinitely flooded around 5500 years ago. Shurrupak, which is named as one ofthe antediluvian cities, was likewise flooded, but not until 700 years later.So, for me, the theory that connects the Sumerian flood tradition with whateverevent it was that flooded Ur is a ‘dog that don’t hunt’. I would honestly soonerconclude that the Sumerians had made the whole thing up than agree that theywere so geographically ignorant and historically naive that they were incapableof distinguishing between a universal flood capable of wiping out humanity and alocal flood – however large. Since we respect them so highly in otherdepartments – as the builders of the world’s first schools, for example, theinventors of the world’s first bicameral congress, the compilers of the world’sfirst law codes,117 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn117] etc. –shouldn’t we also respect the Sumerians’ own evaluation of the great deluge thatthey say swallowed up the cities of their ancestors so long ago in the past?A NEW HYPOTHESISThen I come across Kurt Lambeck’s data. What it tells me is that the floor ofthe Persian Gulf was entirely exposed until as recently as 14,000 years ago,that between 12,000 and 9000 years ago it would have been a veritable Garden ofEden, and that, despite continuous flooding, large areas of the Gulf floorremained above the waves until somewhere between 8000 and 7000 years ago. Sincethese included the Great Pearl Bank – between modern Dubai and Qatar nearBahrain – I find it difficult to believe it is a coincidence that deities withauthentic Sumerian names were worshiped in ancient Bahrain or that the firstdefinite evidence of an identifiably ‘Sumerian’ presence in Iraq is at Eriduaround 7000 years ago – so soon after the Great Pearl Bank was inundated.In short, although I stress again that I’m no scientist, I believe that KurtLambeck’s data is strong enough to justify an entirely new hypothesis on thesubject of ‘the Sumerian problem’. I think it’s time to consider seriously thepossibility that the true story of Sumerian origins may have proved so elusivebecause it is veiled beneath the waters of the Persian Gulf. In that case, Eriduand the other four ‘antediluvian’ cities of Mesopotamia might well bear the samerelationship to the original antediluvian cities of the Gulf floor as Halifax,Nova Scotia bears to Halifax, England or as Perth, Australia bears to Perth,Scotland. They could, in other words, have been named in memory of other, oldercities somewhere else – normal, well-testified behaviour by migrants of almostall cultures in every epoch. Moreover, in this case we are not even required toimagine that the migration came from very far away but merely from the floodedlowlands of the Gulf towards the nearest higher and productive ground that wasblessed by the same Tigris/Euphrates river system as the floor of the Gulf hadonce been.At this point I find that the hypothesis and the existing archaeologicalevidence begin to converge nicely. Yes, it seems to be true that Eridu standsout as one of the earliest ‘nascent’ cities of Sumer, yes, the date ofsubmersion of the Great Pearl Bank coincides quite closely with the date offoundation of the first shrines to Enki at Eridu, and yes, the Sumerians didhave distinct memories of an advanced antediluvian culture that had beendestroyed by a great flood.But still, the flooding of the Gulf was a long-term event, wasn’t it, spread outover more than 6000 years? Surely something that gradual, that predictable, isno more likely than the localized flooding around Ur 5500 years ago to haveinspired the Sumerian tradition of the sudden world-destroying flood thatthreatened the survival of mankind?Before I attempted to test my Sumerian hypothesis further by trying to set up aproper diving expedition in the Gulf (written authorization required intriplicate from Saddam Hussein, the US Navy, the CIA, Texaco, the President ofIran, the King of Saudi Arabia, and the Emirs of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar,Sharjah, Abu Dhabi and Dubai) I decided that I had to learn more about thebehaviour of the world’s oceans in the key 7000-year period from roughly 14,000to 7000 years ago.I knew already that this had been the peak period of the meltdown of the lastIce Age. I knew already that it had been a period of great turbulence andinstability. It was therefore by no means impossible that something had happenedat the global level during these millennia that could have projected a trulycataclysmic flood into the sheltered valley of the Gulf.In fact, as I was to discover, it could have happened more than once …"},{"pageContent":"3 / MELTDOWNAthenian: Do you consider that there is any truth in the ancient tales?Clinias: What tales?Athenian: That the world of men has often been destroyed by floods … in such away that only a small portion of the human race survived.Clinias: Everyone would regard such accounts as perfectly credible.Plato, Laws, vol.

Mammoths bigger than Africanelephants, as well as smaller, pointy-toothed mastodons, ranged from Alaska toCentral America. Herds of horses and camels roamed the grasslands while groundsloths the size of oxen lived in the forests and bear-sized beavers built damsin the streams. By about 10,000 years ago, all of these animals – and otherssuch as American lions, cheetahs, sabertooth cats and giant bears – were gone.Some 70 North American species disappeared, three-quarters of them largemammals. Why?Washington Post, 21 November 2001If you study the literature and talk to the experts on the last Ice Age, youwill find that there are wide differences of opinion over such fundamentalmatters as the main sequence of events, the chronology and consequences of theseevents, and even the terminology used to describe them.The very idea of ‘the last Ice Age’ is poorly defined and is used differently bydifferent authorities. For some it refers to the period from roughly 125,000years ago, when the ice-caps of the northern hemisphere began their most recentadvance, down to about 21,000 years ago, when they reached their maximum extent(LGM – ‘the Last Glacial Maximum’) and then began to melt. Even here, though,there seems to be variation in the scientific literature, as I have seen the LGMdated as early as 25,000 years ago and as late as 18,000 years ago.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn1]Another school of semantics takes a longer view, pointing out that the ‘last IceAge’ was merely the most recent surge in a boom-and-bust cycle of glaciationsand deglaciations going back some 2.6 million years. To them it is this longercycle that is the Ice Age – and it is not ‘the last Ice Age’ because we arestill in it. They point out that the process of deglaciation after 17,000 yearsago was extremely rapid – being largely over within 10,000 years – but not farbeyond the norm set by previous deglaciations. Likewise, the relativelycongenial conditions that we have enjoyed during the 7000 years since then areperhaps a little better than those in some previous interglacials, but notspectacularly so.Although I am not concerned in this inquiry with epochs millions of years in thepast, I note in passing how curiously the fortunes of the creature called manseem to be intertwined with the long chronology of the Ice Age: * The traces of our earliest, upright-walking ancestors of the genus Homo first begin to appear in the fossil record about 2.6 million years ago, when the great cycle of the current Ice Age began. * Another coincidence occurs approximately 125,000 years ago, the onset of the most recent surge of the ice-sheets. It is at about this time, or a little after, that the earliest remains of possible anatomically modern humans are found. * The earliest undisputed remains of anatomically modern humans are much more recent – perhaps 40,000 years old. This is around the same time that the first traces of classic European ‘cave art’ begin to appear – already mature and fully formed – in such locations as the Chauvet Cave in France. * The earliest undisputed remains of large-scale permanent settlements with monumental stone architecture are found around 10,000 years ago – Jericho for example, which stands in the Jordan valley in Palestine. Other impressive sites include Catal Huyuk in Turkey, dating to perhaps 8500 years ago. The whole idea of permanent settlement, however, does not seem to take very wide root until after about 7500 years ago. This is the time when the world’s climate begins to stabilize again after 10,000 years of unbelievable turbulence, melting ice and rising sea-levels. * The same chronology, more or less, and the same loose correlation to the end of the last glaciation, applies to accepted scientific models of the spread of agriculture.But does it? Or is it possible that important parts of the story of our pastcould have been veiled from us by the upheavals of the glacial cycle?Although I know that it was just the most recent of many glaciations, I use theterm ‘the last Ice Age’ to refer to the latest glacial expansion between 125,000and 17,000 years ago. When I use the term Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) I refer notto a specific moment but to a period of approximately 5000 years between 22,000years and 17,000 years ago during which the ice-sheets remained at or near theirmaximum extent. There was some melting and sea-level rise after around 19,000years ago but the volume was relatively small and there was little impact oncoastlines. What may truly be described as the epoch of the ‘meltdown’ beganimmediately afterwards – say 16,500 years ago – with the mass of ice-sheetwasting and associated sea-level rise complete by 7000 years ago.BEFORE THE FLOODImagine the world before the flood. Seventeen thousand years ago, at the end ofthe Last Glacial Maximum, most of northern Europe and North America were buriedunder ice several kilometres thick. So much water was tied up in thesecontinental ice-caps that global sea-level was between 115 and 120 metres lowerthan it is today. The antediluvian world, therefore, looked very different fromthe world we are familiar with. * A land-bridge joined Alaska and Siberia across what is now the Bering Strait. * It was possible to walk from southern England to northern France across the dry valley that would later become the English Channel. * Many more islands were exposed in the Mediterranean than are visible today and existing islands were much larger. Malta, for example, was certainly joined on to Sicily. Corsica and Sardinia formed a single huge island. * Further east, we’ve already seen that the whole of the Persian Gulf as far as the Strait of Hormuz was dry 17,000 years ago but for its great alluvium-rich river and its life-giving lakes … * Further east still, India’s coastlines were much more extensive at the end of the last Ice Age than they are today and the shape of the subcontinent was strikingly different. Sri Lanka was joined to the mainland and south of Sri Lanka, sprawling across the equator, the Maldive islands were far larger than they are today. * Around modern Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, and stretching as far north as Japan, lay the endless plains of ‘Sunda Land’, a fully fledged antediluvian continent. It was submerged very rapidly some time between 14,000 and 11,000 years ago. * Up until about 12,000 years ago, the three main islands of Japan formed a continuous landmass. * In the southern seas lay the gigantic Ice Age continent of Sahul, formed out of the united landmasses of Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. * Across the Pacific the thousands of small, remote islands of today were integrated into much larger archipelagos 17,000 years ago. * In the western Atlantic, in the same epoch, the Grand Bahama Banks, now shallowly submerged, formed a huge plateau 120 metres above sea-level, and all of the Florida, Yucatan and Nicaragua shelves were exposed.2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn2]In short, the habitable landmasses that modern civilizations have inherited fromthe meltdown of the last Ice Age only began to take their present form in theten millennia between 17,000 and 7000 years ago.Before that, areas that are densely populated today, Chicago, New York,Manchester, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Berlin, Moscow – in fact most of North Americaand northern Europe – were absolutely uninhabitable due to the fact that theywere covered by ice-caps several kilometres thick. Conversely, many areas thatare uninhabitable today – on account of being on the bottom of the sea, or inthe middle of hostile deserts such as the Sahara (which bloomed for about 4000years at the end of the last Ice Age) – were once (and relatively recently)desirable places to live that were capable of supporting dense populations.Geologists calculate that nearly 5 per cent of the earth’s surface – an area ofaround 25 million square kilometres or 10 million square miles – has beenswallowed by rising sea-levels since the end of the Ice Age.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn3] That is roughly equivalent to thecombined areas of the United States (9.6 million square kilometres) and thewhole of South America (17 million square kilometres). It is an area almostthree times as large as Canada and much larger than China and Europe combined.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn4]What adds greatly to the significance of these lost lands of the last Ice Age isnot only their enormous area but also – because they were coastal and inpredominantly warm latitudes – that they would have been among the very bestlands available to humanity anywhere in the world at that time. Moreover,although they represent 5 per cent of the earth’s surface today, it is worthreminding ourselves that humanity during the Ice Age was denied useful access tomuch of northern Europe and North America because of the ice-sheets. So the 25million square kilometres that were lost to the rising seas add up to a greatdeal more than 5 per cent of the earth’s useful and habitable landspace at thattime.Now, imagine if you were to discover a hidden secret: the entire orthodoxaccount of world prehistory as it is presented in the classroom, at university,through books and in the media has been created by archaeologists with noreference whatsoever to China and Europe, or to South America and the land-massof the USA. Having missed out entirely such large areas from their excavationsand research wouldn’t you feel that their conclusions about world prehistory andthe story of the origins of civilization were likely to be – to say the least –flawed? Well, it is a similar story with the 25 million square kilometres lostat the end of the Ice Age. Marine archaeologists have barely even begun asystematic survey for possible submerged sites on these flooded lands. Mostwould regard it as a waste of time even to look. In consequence, whether inAustralia or Europe, the Middle East, India or south-east Asia, the enormousimplications of the changes in land-use and rising sea-levels between 17,000 and7000 years ago do not appear ever to have been seriously considered byhistorians and archaeologists seeking the origins of civilization.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_006_r1.jpg][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_006a_r1.jpg]A CASE HISTORY: THE DROWNED 3 MILLION SQUARE KILOMETRES OF SAHULLet’s look more closely at what happened to Sahul – also known as ‘GreaterAustralia’ – between approximately 17,000 and 7000 years ago. Much of the storyhas been unravelled by the work of Jim Allen, an archaeologist at Australia’s LaTrobe University, and Peter Kershaw from the Department of Geography andEnvironmental Science at Monash University, Melbourne.5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn5][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_007_r1.jpg]Sahul at the Last Glacial Maximum.Until the end of the Last Glacial Maximum 17,000 years ago, and probably forseveral thousand years afterwards, New Guinea was fully integrated with theAustralian continent across the Torres Strait and the Arafura Sea, Tasmania wasfully integrated in the south – the Bass Strait then being dry land – and ‘othersmaller, now offshore, islands were also incorporated’.6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn6] In total Allen and Kershawestimate that Sahul of 17,000 years ago extended ‘from almost exactly theEquator to nearly 44 degrees S and from 112 degrees E to 154 degrees E’.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn7]Then came the meltdown:Between circa 16,000 BP and 7000 BP Greater Australia was reduced in area bymore than three million square kilometres – an area much larger than Mexico.Three major landmasses existed where previously there had been one … Coastalsites were either submerged or preserved on islands, while sites of the formerarid interior became coastal … In places the postglacial marine transgressionreduced the width of the coastal plain by up to several hundred kilometres, thuspresumably drowning many terminal Pleistocene sites in the process …’8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn8]And how much else? There are, after all, a number of discontinuities andmysteries in the human story in Australia, not least the venerable antiquity ofits first settlers – thought to date back as far as 50,000 years. Though thereis no archaeological evidence whatsoever that a high civilization in thetechnical, material or urban senses ever flourished here before the modern era,there are certain aspects of Aboriginal culture that are frankly puzzling and donot fit in. These include evidence of sophisticated astronomical ideas from avery early date and the use of an ‘astronomical terminology’ that is also foundin other very distant regions of the world. Thanks to the research of theRussian prehistorian Boris Frolov, for example, we must now ask ourselveswhether it is a coincidence that indigenous tribal peoples as far afield asNorth America, Siberia and Australia all called the Pleiades star-group ‘theSeven Sisters’.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn9] Frolov’s own viewis that coincidence is not a satisfactory explanation and that only an extremelyancient shared heritage can account for this and many other thought-provokingparallels that he has uncovered.10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn10] But if Frolov is right, as theCambridge anthropologist Richard Rudgley observes in his groundbreaking LostCivilizations of the Stone Age, then the implication is:a tradition of communicable knowledge of the heavens that has existed for over40,000 years, since a time roughly coinciding with the beginning of the UpperPalaeolithic. This is something that is extremely awkward for most widelyaccepted views of the history of knowledge and science – in short it is far, fartoo early for most people to accept.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn11]Of course, it is true that archaeologists excavating Australian terrestrialsites have not turned up any evidence there of the kind of social infrastructurethat would normally be associated with the spread of a global astronomicaltradition. But with more than 3 million square kilometres of Greater Australiasubmerged between 16,000 and 7000 years ago, and almost entirely unexplored byarchaeologists, who can be sure what yet might be found?FLOODS AND CIVILIZATIONWere the post-glacial ‘floods’ really floods at all? It doesn’t take amathematical genius to work out that 120 metres of sea-level rise spread outover 10,000 years amounts to an average of not much more than a metre a century.Inconvenient, certainly … But surely not enough to submerge and sweep away alltraces of a great civilization? Surely not enough to inspire the global myth ofthe flood-so often accompanied, as it was in Sumer, by the unshakeableconviction that the gods had resolved to obliterate mankind?In previous books I have discussed the cycle of the Ice Ages. Over the past 2.6million years, this cycle shows strong correlations with the (slowly changing)obliquity and precession of the earth’s axis and the varying degree ofeccentricity of its orbit around the sun. Some scientists feel that theselarge-scale astronomical influences are sufficient, on their own, to explain therecurrent glaciations and deglaciations of our planet. Others feel that triggerfactors must also be involved – extreme episodes of volcanism, asteroidal orcometary impacts, a realignment of the earth’s crust or mantle, and so on and soforth.Irrespective of the cause, however, there is no dispute about the biggestconsequence of the meltdown of the last Ice Age: sea-level is now 120 metreshigher than it was 17,000 years ago. This, by any standards, represents adramatic change in the distribution of habitats for human settlement and should,one might expect, be a matter of great interest to archaeologists. When I beganto research this subject I was therefore surprised to learn that this is not atall the case: * only an infinitesimal amount of marine archaeology has been done along continental shelves (infinitesimal in relation to the total area of land submerged worldwide); * of the marine archaeology that has been done, the largest part has been focused upon the discovery and excavation of shipwrecks and of sites submerged in historical times;12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn12] * with the exception of Robert Ballard’s exciting underwater survey of the Black Sea for the National Geographic Society, which got underway in 2000 and has been oriented directly towards an investigation of a colossal incursion of the Mediterranean through the Bosporus narrows 7500 years ago, marine archaeology has simply not concerned itself with the possibility that the post-glacial floods might in any way be connected to the problem of the rise of civilizations.I am aware that there is a new mood of political correctness amongstarchaeologists and a willingness to accept, and state publicly, that the peoplesof the Stone Age were neither ignorant savages nor lowbrow ‘cave men’ – althoughone need only spend a moment glancing at the transcendental art of Lascaux torealize that! But still it seems to me true to say that the great majority ofarchaeologists see no particular trend or connection that obviously links the‘Palaeolithic’ way of life, 17,000 or even 12,000 years ago, to the urban way oflife that first appears at Jericho, Catal Huyuk and a handful of other sitesbetween 10,000 and 7000 years ago. This is why, although they are certainly moreopen than they were before to the spirituality and high artistic culture of theancients, archaeologists – almost without exception – do still assume that thepopulation of the earth was at a uniformly hunter-gatherer level of social andeconomic development 17,000 years ago, and still about 7000 years away fromfounding the first cities. They therefore have no particular reason to beinterested in the fact that millions of square kilometres of continental shelfwere flooded in the intervening years, changing the face of the habitable earthcompletely.If, on the other hand, the level of development of different cultures in thatperiod was not uniform (as is the case in the world today) and if one or severalcultures had concentrated along the ancient sea-shores – or in any other areaswhich might have been rapidly and cataclysmically inundated – then it ispossible that the post-glacial floods could have had enormous significance forthe story of civilization.Moreover, the rise in sea-level of 120 metres over those 10,000 years between17,000 and 7000 years ago is large enough to have engulfed entire cities forever and either demolished or covered up with millennial deposits of silt andmuck all evidence of their former existence. If the waves rose slowly, suchhypothetical cities would have been pounded for centuries in the high-energyintertidal zone which makes short work even of granite structures. But if thesea-level rise was due to some cataclysmic surge, then walls of water would haveborne down on and crushed beyond recognition much that stood in their path.MANY THINGS HAPPENING AT ONCEIt is hard to know where to begin to tell the story of the meltdown of the lastIce Age, because it is really many different stories woven together into asingle fabric. * Part of it concerns large-scale climate flips, sudden radical thaws and equally radical freezes, volcanism on a planetary scale, earthquakes of unparalleled ferocity and mass extinctions of animal species. * Part of it, which I’ve already touched on, is the huge loss of habitable land, of low-lying coastal plains and fertile river deltas that occurred as the sea-level rose – a ‘lost continent’ scattered around the world like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle with a combined land area of 25 million square kilometres. * Part of it concerns the speed and the sheer magnitude of the post-glacial flooding. * Part of it is the need to understand the processes that led the earth into this devastating cycle of inundations. * Part of it is a complexity: yes, global sea-level did rise by about 120 metres between 17,000 and 7000 years ago; no this ‘eustatic’ rise (i.e. pertaining to sea-level alone) has not been uniformly reflected in changing shorelines through time. Thus, in some parts of the world sea-level relative to ancient shorelines has remained quite stable for millennia; in others, submersion of a particular locality may be deeper than expected from eustatic changes; in yet others submersion may be shallower than expected from eustatic changes. Such variations can be caused by local land subsidence or land rise following earthquakes or volcanic activity; however, a much more potent and extensive agent of changing land-levels is known to geologists as isostacy.KICKING THE GEL-FILLED FOOTBALLThe earth’s surface, which seems solid beneath out feet, can yield and deformwhen subjected to sufficiently large pressures. It behaves a bit like a footballthat has been loosely filled with a thick, heavy gel: pressure at one point onthe gel-filled ball will result in an indentation in that area, a displacementof the fluid mass within and a corresponding rise in a roughly circular areasurrounding the indentation. Geologists call this process isostacy, and it playsan important role not only during Ice Ages but also for thousands of years afterall the ice has melted away. The reason it does so is that the vast weight ofthe ice-caps is sufficient to force down the earth’s crust into great basin-likedepressions beneath them. When the ice melts, that pressure is suddenly removedand the floors of the basins begin to rebound; they will, if sufficient time isallowed, rise again to their original levels.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_008_r1.jpg]Ice-loading causes a depression in crust under ice, and an isostatic bulgeeffect beyond it. Based on Wilson and Drury (2000).At the LGM 17,000 years ago, the ice-caps over large parts of North America andnorthern Europe were between 2 and 4 kilometres thick and applied loads ofthousands of billions of tonnes to the continental landmasses on which they hadformed.13 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn13] Thomas Crowley andGerald North, both oceanographers at Texas A&M University, observe that NorthAmerica’s Laurentide ice-sheetextended from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic shore and from the ArcticOcean southward to about the present positions of the Missouri and Ohio rivers.In Europe the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet reached northern Germany and theNetherlands. The weight of the massive ice sheets depressed the crust by as muchas 700–800 metres, resulting in gravity anomalies that are still detectable.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn14][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_009_r1.jpg]The post-glacial world showing regions of isostatic rebound (light shade) andsubmergence (dark shade). Based on Wilson and Drury (2000).On average it has been found that 100 metres of ice-loading depressescontinental crust by 27 metres.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn15]But this is only part of the story. The water of the world’s oceans also hasweight; indeed it is denser than ice. Thus, 100 metres of water-loadingdepresses the sea-bed beneath it by 30 metres.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn16] Since all the ice formed on landduring the last Ice Age was made out of water extracted from the sea, it followsthat while the crust was pressed down beneath the continents, it actually roseup beneath the oceans (as the water-burden above it lightened). Conversely,after all the ice had melted and returned to the oceans as water, the burden onthe sea-bed would have again increased. R. C. L. Wilson, Professor of EarthSciences at Britain’s Open University, calculates that a layer of water 165metres deep was subtracted from the oceans to make the great ice-caps of thelast glaciation. This, however, only produced a net drop in relative sea-levelof around 115 metres between the onset of glaciation 125,000 years ago and theonset of LGM 104,000 years later – the reason for the discrepancy being thatreduced water-loading in the oceans during the Ice Age allowed the sea-bed torise by 50 metres through the process of isostatic compensation.17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn17]Let’s stop for a moment and take another look at this see-saw system swing byswing: 1. 125,000 years ago the most recent glacial surge begins, turning a worldwide layer of ocean 165 metres deep into ice-caps thousands of metres high piled up (for the most part) in North America, Greenland, northern Europe, South America and the Himalayas. 2. The maximum extent of ice formation is reached 21,000 years ago and largely maintained until 17,000 years ago; by this time the continental crust beneath the big ice-caps has been depressed into huge basins nearly a kilometre deep. 3. Simultaneously, as the ice-burden on the land increases, the water-burden on the sea-bed decreases; by the Last Glacial Maximum this had allowed the ocean-floor around the world to rise by 50 metres. 4. Soon after the LGM the ice begins to melt and to flow back as water to the oceans, a process that is substantially over within 10,000 years. 5. Since a layer of water 165 metres deep was taken out of the oceans to begin with to make up the ice-caps, it follows that a layer of water 165 metres deep is returned to the oceans with the complete melting of the ice-sheets. 6. Professor Wilson observes that the rate at which the crust and mantle respond to loading and unloading is ‘much slower than the build-up or melting of ice caps. This is why areas that were buried beneath several kilometres of ice 18,000 years ago are still rising today, thousands of years after the ice sheet melted away.’18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn18] 7. It also follows that the average 50 metre rebound of the ocean floor between 125,000 and 17,000 years ago would take thousands of years to be forced down again by isostatic subsidence to its original level. 8. Measured at a warm point in a long interglacial, and after 17,000 years of isostatic subsidence, today’s sea-level is probably quite close to the final balance in the equation of rising seas and sinking sea-beds. But there must have been many times during the meltdown of the Ice Age when the speed of the former far outstripped any compensating effects of the latter.Is it not possible, perhaps even probable, that this combination of a highersea-floor than today’s and rapid influxes of meltwater from the decayingice-caps could have produced relative temporary rises in sea-level much greaterthan the average annual rate projected over the full period of the meltdown?SEE-SAWExamples of segments of continental crust that continue to rise throughisostatic rebound since the removal of the ice-sheets include the highlands ofScotland19 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn19] (where the ice-capthat once covered most of Britain was at its thickest), the floor of the Gulf ofBothnia in what is now the Baltic Sea (reported to be rising at a rate of ametre per century),20 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn20] large partsof the coasts and mainland of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, the north-east coastof Canada,21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn21] and parts ofsouthern Chile.22 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn22]Complicating the picture is the fact that around each zone of ‘post-glacialrebound’, there lies what geologists call a ‘peripheral zone ofsubmergence’-which is always larger than the zone of rebound.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn23] Thus, while it is not uncommon tofind such phenomena as raised beaches in the highlands of Scotland24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn24] (demonstrating graphically thatareas that were once at sea-level, and formed an ancient coastline, have nowbeen lifted well above it), other areas of the British Isles are visibly sinkinginto the sea. This is because the downward pressure of the Fennoscandianice-sheet on the northern European continental crust at the LGM was transformedby the mechanism of isostatic compensation into a huge ‘forebulge’ severalhundred kilometres beyond the ice-margin-literally as though one end of asee-saw had been forced down, pushing the other end up. As the ice melted theweight that was holding the end of the ‘see-saw’ down was released, allowing itto rise again and causing the other end – the ‘forebulge’ – to fall.This is exactly what is happening in the English Channel today, which we’ve seenwas entirely dry at the LGM. The Isle of Wight stood on the forebulge of theFennoscandian ice-sheet, forced upwards by isostatic compensation. Then when theice-sheet melted, the dynamics of isostacy again came into play and theforebulge began to subside – taking the Isle of Wight (and much of southernEngland) down with it.ISOSTATIC ATLANTISAn ingenious theory of the lost land of Atlantis, the first that I am aware ofthat is explicitly based upon the relationship between isostacy and risingsea-levels, was put forward in the late 1990s by Vitacheslav Koudriavtsev, amember of the Russian Geographical Society of the Russian Academy of Sciences.It is well known that the story of Atlantis was set in writing in the fourthcentury BC by the Greek philosopher Plato – in his dialogues Critias andTimaeus. But before that, Plato tells us, it had been an oral tradition passeddown within his family from his ancestor Solon, the revered Athenian lawmaker.Solon had been told it during a visit that he had made to Egypt at around 600BC. His informant, in turn, had been an elderly Egyptian priest at the Temple ofSais in the Delta, who said that he had drawn the information from writtenrecords, then more than 8000 years old, lodged in the temple’s archives.There are four essential ingredients in Plato’s story: * Atlantis was a relatively advanced, well-organized and prosperous civilization. * It flourished and was destroyed 9000 years before Solon’s time – in other words, approximately 11,600 years before our time. * It was located on a large island ‘opposite the Pillars of Hercules’ – presumed to be the modern Straits of Gibraltar. * Its destruction was the result of a global cataclysm: ‘There were earthquakes and floods of extraordinary violence, and in a single dreadful day and a night … the island of Atlantis was … swallowed up by the sea and vanished.’25 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn25]There have been a thousand theories about the location of lost Atlantis, movingit around in time according to individual researchers’ whims and placing iteverywhere from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to Indonesia and from the Andes mountainsto Crete. What Koudriavtsev is suggesting is just another theory. Nevertheless,it has the great merit of requiring no liberties to be taken with Plato’s texteither in respect of the location of ‘Atlantis’ (beyond the Straits of Gibraltarin the Atlantic Ocean) or of the date of its submergence – 11,600 years ago.Koudriavtsev’s location is an area known to fishermen as the Little Sole Bank,situated on a vast underwater plateau called the Celtic Shelf, 200 kilometres tothe south-west of the British Isles and Ireland. Although the shallowest part ofLittle Sole Bank is now 57 metres beneath the waves, and thus might be expectedto have been about 60 metres above sea-level just before the end of the last IceAge, Koudriavtsev’s research shows that it and a large area of the surroundingshelf may have been tilted dramatically upwards during the build-up to the LastGlacial Maximum by the see-saw effect of isostatic forces emanating from thecontinental ice-mass. In brief, his theory is that there was an unusually rapidcollapse of the forebulge in this area around 11,600 years ago, coinciding witha ferocious episode of ice-melting and global flooding – the sudden inundationof Atlantis described by Plato.‘In my opinion,’ states Koudriavtsev,the most serious argument in favour of the assumption that Atlantis was notinvented by Plato is that the time when it vanished, as indicated by Plato –about 11,600 years ago – and the circumstances of its vanishing described by him(the sinking into the deep of the sea), coincide with the findings of modernscience about the end of the last Ice Age and the substantial rise of the levelof the World Ocean that accompanied it.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn26]THREE GLOBAL SUPERFLOODSAnyone who has read the Timaeus and Critias carefully knows that what Platodescribes in his account of the destruction of Atlantis is indeed a global floodthat took place approximately 11,600 years ago and that swallowed up hugelandmasses as far apart as the eastern Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean. Iwould have thought that a first line of approach for scholars investigatingPlato’s claims would be to find out whether anything on this scale mightactually have happened in the world 11,600 years ago. So far as I can discover,however, not a single historian or prehistorian has ever made the effort to doso – although many of them have put forward theories, usually widely applaudedby their peers, locating Atlantis anywhere but in the Atlantic, where Plato saysit was, and any time within the epoch of recorded history, rather thanconsidering the prehistoric date of 9600 BC given by Plato. One of the ludicrous(but positively peer-reviewed) claims put forward to divert the debate endlesslyinto trivia is that Plato meant 9000 months before Solon’s time, not 9000 years,when he spoke of the submergence of Atlantis.In my experience historians and archaeologists will go through Houdini-likecontortions of reason and common sense rather than consider the possibility thattheir paradigm of prehistory might be wrong – so I am not surprised that theyhave never attempted to investigate at face value the Atlantis tradition of adevastating global flood 11,600 years ago. However, there are scholars – trainedin other disciplines and not hobbled by the same preconceptions – who are moreopen to the possibility that the flood tradition in general, and the Atlantisstory specifically, might be rooted in the real events of the meltdown of thelast Ice Age. This view has been entertained positively by the late CesareEmiliani, for example, former Professor in the Department of Geological Sciencesat the University of Miami27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn27] –one of the pioneers of the isotopic analysis of deep-sea sediments as a way tostudy the earth’s past climates.28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn28] Moreover, Emiliani’s fieldwork inthe Gulf of Mexico has produced striking evidence of cataclysmic global flooding‘between 12,000 and 11,000 years ago’.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn29] Robert Schoch, Professor in theDepartment of Geology at Boston University, observes that there was also adramatic warming of the earth’s climate in the same period30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn30] – the ‘Preboreal’ – and thatoverall there is astunning line-up in time between the sudden warming of 9645 BC, Emiliani’sscenario of a massive freshwater flood pouring into the Gulf of Mexico, and thedate Plato ascribed to the sinking of Atlantis. Whatever the accuracy ofspecific details, this curious coincidence points to the effect sudden climaticchanges can have – and no doubt have had – on civilization.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn31]Science writer Paul LaViolette likewise argues that ‘there may be much truth tothe many flood cataclysm stories that have been handed down to modern times invirtually every culture of the world. In particular, the 9600 BC date thatPlato’s Timaeus gives for the time of the deluge happens to fall at thebeginning of the Preboreal at the time of the upsurge of meltwater discharge.’32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn32]Before rejecting the possibility of a lost civilization of the last Ice Age,therefore, I urge historians and archaeologists to take a close look at the massof data that now exists about the sequence of cataclysmic floods that swept theearth between 17,000 and 7000 years ago.Yet this too is a contentious area of debate. For while scientists now agree onthe approximate figure of 120 metres for sea-level rise during the 10,000 yearsof post-glacial flooding, many do not accept that these were ‘floods’ at all –and certainly not in the cataclysmic sense. Averaging the rise over thetime-span as we did earlier, they see a fairly gradual and distinctlynon-cataclysmic process in the range of a metre a century. This remains themajority view. But since Emiliani’s findings first began to undermine it in the1970s there has been more and more research to show how very cataclysmic themeltdown of the Ice Age could in fact have been.In brief what is being suggested is that during the long span of the meltdown –in addition to countless episodes of smaller-scale flooding – there were threeglobal superfloods which have been dated within the following approximatetime-bands: 15,000–14,000 years ago, 12,000–11,000 years ago and 8000–7000 yearsago. I have found that estimates of these dates vary by more than a thousandyears either way, depending upon which authority you consult, but the generalpoint is clear enough: there now exists a strong case that nearly half the totalmeltwater release at the end of the last Ice Age was concentrated into thesethree relatively short episodes, creating conditions of concentrated damageafter long periods of stability – precisely the combination of circumstances andbad luck that could have led ultimately to the destruction of an antediluvianculture.33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn33]PROFESSOR EMILIANI’S ICE DAMSCesare Emiliani made many original contributions to scientific understanding ofthe meltdown of the last Ice Age. He was also among the first to work out theprecise mechanism behind the characteristic ‘rhythm’ of this 10,000-year period– millennia of slow melting and gradual sea-level rises interrupted, apparentlyrandomly, by much shorter episodes of extremely severe global flooding andrapid, destructive oceanic transgressions:During the last Ice Age, ice reached its maximum extension 20,000 years ago.Deglaciation started almost immediately and progressed rapidly. Sometimes icemeltwater would pile up behind an ice dam and when the dam collapsed a huge flowwould follow. One such great flood occurred in the American northwest 13,500years ago when an ice dam holding back about 2000 cubic kilometres of icemeltwater (Lake Missoula) collapsed. A huge mass of muddy water and debrisrushed across the area into the Columbia River, cutting broad channels calledcoulees and forming the so-called Channelled Scabland … As a result of the floodthat formed the Scabland, the sea-level rose very rapidly, from minus 100 tominus 80 metres [vis-à-vis today’s level]. By 12,000 years ago more than 50 percent of the ice had returned to the ocean, and the sea-level had risen to minus60 metres. At that point other giant floods occurred, down the Mississippi Rivervalley into the Gulf of Mexico and down the Siberian river valleys into theArctic Ocean. The Mississippi flood carried pebbles, which are now confined tothe upper reaches of the Missouri-Mississippi system, all the way down to thedelta. Sea-level rose very rapidly from minus 60 metres to minus 40 metres.34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn34]The key phrase that caught my attention when I first read this passage was ‘icedam’. It was very simple, and yet it explained so much. Averaged out over 10,000years it was true that the total global sea-level rise of 120 metres at the endof the last Ice Age only amounted to a little more than a metre a century. Butwhat Emiliani was now suggesting was the intriguing possibility that enormousquantities of the glacial meltwater could have been detained for thousands ofyears behind ice dams on continental Europe and continental North America – andthen released into the open ocean all at once.The ice-caps that formerly covered these areas were up to 4 kilometres thick, aswe’ve seen, and larger than present-day Antarctica in both cases.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn35] Emiliani reminds us how:The weight of the ice on the land surface below created bowl-shaped depressionsabout 1 km deep. Heat from the interior of the earth was trapped under the icesheets, the bottom ice melted, and great freshwater lakes formed. Twice in NorthAmerica and western Siberia these lakes busted through the ice margins andcreated huge floods. Sea-level rose abruptly around 13,000 years ago and again11,000 years ago and then more slowly as the residual ice continued melting.Some have hypothesized that these prehistoric floods generated the flood legendscommon to many civilizations.36 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn36][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_010_r1.jpg]Between 8900 and 8200 years ago, the Laurentide ice-sheet disintegrated in theHudson Bay, facilitating catastrophic drainage of the massive Agassiz/Ojibwayglacial lakes into the Labrador Sea. Based on Barber et al. (1999).PROFESSOR SHAW’S ABRUPT STEPSJohn Shaw, Professor of Earth Sciences at the University of Alberta, is one ofthe world’s leading experts on the last Ice Age and on its catastrophicmeltdown. The author of an impressive list of peer-reviewed scientific papers,his research is at the forefront of inquiry in this field and has focused on thereasons for the superfloods. This is the graphic account that he gave us:The big ice-sheets that covered Canada, most of Scandinavia and much of northernRussia – instead of them being pure ice and rock – it seems that at a late stagethere was rock at the bottom and then a sub-glacial lake or reservoir of water,then the ice. And it’s possible that when warming occurred, the top of the icestarted to melt, and the ablation zone and the sub-glacial water got bigger andbigger and bigger. And yet for good reason the ice-sheet seals around the edges.And then one time the big system on top connects – it’s a little bit like atoilet bowl, you sort of open the valve and the water comes surging through.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_011_r1.jpg]Graph of sea-level in the Caribbean against time since the LGM showing threeabrupt steps around 14,000, 11,000 and 8000 years ago. Based on Blanchon andShaw (1994).[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_012_r1.jpg]Graph of rate of sea-level rise against time since the LGM. Based on Blanchonand Shaw (1994).[In Canada on one occasion] the water literally came spewing out all over,except to the east of the Hudson Strait, because there was a big ice barrierthere. So it came out southwards and through the St Lawrence, through the fingerlakes, down through the Red river, South Winnipeg and the Winnipeg Lakes, andout through parts of Saskatchewan and out over the Milk river – which is thecontinental divide south of Alberta. The Milk river water flowed north to theArctic, to the east to Hudson Bay, south to the Gulf of Mexico. And a hugeamount of water went north into the Arctic Ocean. So you were suddenlyintroducing a vast amount of water to the oceans. And the duration of the flowswas probably measured in weeks. And the kind of flow that we’re talking about,just for a small filament in Alberta, would have been 10 million cubic metresper second – that would drain Lake Ontario in about four days. And sea-levelwould have risen instantly, and somewhere in the region of 10 metres. This isabout 15,000 years ago, when there were people living in many places. And thesea-level would have suddenly risen, and if you had lived by the sea-shorecollecting jellyfish or something like that, and your house was suddenlyunderwater, you’d notice it. I imagine that it had quite an impression on theoral tradition and myths.So the big event came from under the ice about 15,000 years ago. And then about11,000 years ago there was a big lake in the southern part of the ice-sheetcalled Lake Agassiz that covered a big part of Canada. There was an equally biglake called the Baltic Ice Lake in Scandinavia. And then recent evidencesuggests that there were big lakes across northern Asia and the north of theSoviet Union. These lakes were dammed by ice and tended to drain very suddenly.And as a result you get a similar effect, with a sudden rise in sea-level. Thenlast of all, about 8,000 years ago, there was the last lake in North Americaassociated with the Laurentide ice-sheet which is called Lake Ojibway, and itlay just south of the Hudson Strait. And that lake drained catastrophically.So originally it was thought that the rise of sea-level was steady at the end ofthe Ice Age, but now we are able to see that it rose abruptly in steps.37[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn37]FLOODS, VOLCANOES, EARTHQUAKESProfessor Shaw’s ‘abrupt steps’ were, arguably, the most traumatic experiencesof global cataclysm that our species has ever undergone. To those alive then,the end of the last Ice Age with its sudden global floods must have seemed likethe end of the world. Continental plates were shifting upwards relieved of theweight of the ice they’d supported for 100,000 years. Huge earthquakes andoutbreaks of volcanism accompanied this extensive crustal rebalancing. The earthwould have rung like a bell with tremendous sounds and vibrations. The sky wouldhave been heavy with volcanic dust and black, bituminous rain. And at the sametime the oceans were remorselessly, apparently unstoppably, rising. One of thegeo-climatological mysteries of the last Ice Age is that the period of themeltdown – roughly from 17,000 to 7000 years ago – was also a period ofdramatically enhanced volcanic activity. A paper published in Nature in October1997 draws particular attention to what at first sight seems like a bizarrecorrelation between the rate of global sea-level change and the frequency ofexplosive volcanism in the Mediterranean area – with a distinct episode ofenhanced volcanic activity registered in the geological andpalaeo-climatological records between 17,000 and 6000 years ago:38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn38]In areas where active volcanism and glaciation coincide, the correlation betweenthe events can be explained by the effect of changing ice volumes on crustalstress. In contrast the effect of ice-sheet volume changes on unglaciatedvolcanic areas remains problematical. Several authors have proposed thatmeltwater loading and unloading could influence volcanic activity at sitesdistant from areas of ice-accumulation through the global redistribution ofwater, although this hypothesis has never been tested.39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn39]The international team of scholars behind the Nature article counted tephralayers in deep-sea cores from the bottom of the Mediterranean (tephra is ageneral term for solid matter ejected during volcanic eruptions) and concludethat:The frequency of tephra-producing events and, by proxy, notable explosiveeruptions at Mediterranean volcanoes, can be related to rapid variations insea-level change. In particular we draw attention to the quiescent phase centredat 22,000 years ago and corresponding to the last low sea-level stand, and tothe most intense period of tephra layer formation between 15,000 and 8000 yearsago which accompanied the very rapid rise in post-glacial sea-levels.40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn40]The authors think that ‘the existence of a single causal link between the rateof sea-level change and the level of explosive activity is unlikely’ and pointout that ‘the unique response of individual volcanoes to large changes insea-levels requires detailed study of each eruption record’.41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn41] Where this has been done,however, ‘The level of explosive eruptions is seen to fall to a marked lowbetween 22,000 years ago and 15,000 years ago, coincident with the last lowsea-level stand.’42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn42]I find it intriguing that the end of a 7000-year period of volcanic quiescence15,000 years ago, and the beginning of the period of violent eruptions, bothoverlap with the first of John Shaw’s global superfloods; likewise the end ofthe period of enhanced volcanic activity around 8000 years ago follows Shaw’sthird and last superflood.Addressing this point, the scientists writing in Nature argue for broad-scaleinfluences operating, for example, throughstress changes in continental margins and at island arcs. These may promote theascent of fresh batches of magma into volcanoes, while increased levels ofregional seismicity related to load distribution may play a role indestabilizing already weakened volcanoes.On a global scale the number of volcanoes susceptible to the above-mentionedeffects is large. Current spatial distributions of active volcanoes show that 57per cent form islands or occupy coastal sites while a further 38 per cent arelocated within 250 kilometres from a coastline. Assuming a similar distributionfor around 1500 volcanoes active during [the last Ice Age], then 1400 are likelyto have been subject to the more direct effects of rapid sea-level change …Furthermore, the rapidity of these sea-level changes, and consequently theirpotential to trigger responses in active volcanic structures, are only nowbecoming apparent.43 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn43]Despite its authors’ caution about identifying a single cause, the evidence setout in the Nature paper does suggest that the earth’s own isostatic rebalancingprocess, sparked off by the sudden meltdown of the ice-sheets and rapidly risingsea-levels at the end of the last Ice Age, must have been what awakened thevolcanoes. The implication is that isostatic adjustment does not always proceedat a constant, steady rate – otherwise volcanism would presumably be constant aswell – but must at times involve large, rapid shifts transmitting shock-wavesthrough the earth’s crust powerful enough to set the volcanoes raging around theglobe.It is precisely a shift of this speed and magnitude that Koudriavtsev envisageswith his hypothesized ‘overnight’ collapse of the Celtic Shelf on the forebulgeof the Fennoscandian ice-sheet 11,600 years ago. Moreover, researchers havefound evidence that the meltdown of the same ice-sheet also unleashed tremendousforces during other periods of rapid worldwide flooding. At the time of Shaw’sthird great flood around 8000 years ago, for example, the stresses andearthquakes became so severe that immense waves were formed in the ground. Oneof these, in northern Sweden, is 150 kilometres long and 10 metres high and hasbeen described as a ‘rock tsunami’44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn44] that can only have been caused by‘earthquakes of unbelievable magnitude’.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn45]DESCENT OF HELLSnaking across a bleak landscape, Sweden’s Parvie (‘wave in the ground’) as itis known locally, is a remarkable and somewhat disturbing feature, exactlyresembling a three-storey-high tsunami made of solid rock caught forever infreeze-frame as it rears up just before breaking. The most remarkable – anddisturbing – thing about it, however, is that this part of northern Sweden is azone of extremely low seismicity and stands on what geologists define as a‘stable continental region’ (SCR) of the tectonic plate.46[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn46] There should be no reason forcatastrophic earthquakes ever to happen in an SCR. Yet the evidenceunambiguously demonstrates that a catastrophic earthquake – indeed ‘the largestearthquake ever known within the stable continental regions’47[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn47] – did throw up the Parvie:Studies over the last two decades show that it formed suddenly by earthquakefaulting in the late glacial to early postglacial times of the greatFennoscandian ice sheet (approximately 8000 to 8500 years ago), suggesting agenetic relationship between the two.48[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn48]The precise nature of this relationship and the true magnitude of ‘post-glacialfaults’ (PGFs) such as the Parvie have been studied by Ronald Arvidsson of theSeismological Department of Uppsala University. He has shown that such faults –of which there are a whole series in northern Sweden – frequently cut as far as40 kilometres deep into the earth’s crust. All were caused by different giganticearthquakes and all these earthquakes occurred within the same thousand-yearperiod between 9000 and 8000 years ago.49[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn49]Arvidsson’s widely agreed estimate is that the Parvie quake measured 8.2 on theRichter scale.50 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn50] Another scholar,Arch C. Johnston of the Centre for Earthquake Research at the University ofMemphis, points out that quakes of this magnitude only occur today along theedges of tectonic plates. The force that formed the Parvie ground-wave must,therefore, have been enormous:The Fennoscandian PGF’s are … a remarkable consequence of rapid crustalunloading as the ice-sheets of the last Ice Age melted. The Parvie and otherPGF’s … represent the faults of induced earthquakes, events that would not havehappened without externally-imposed … conditions.51[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn51]Johnston then goes on to note that, although ‘induced seismicity’ is knowntoday,the post-glacial earthquakes are easily the largest known examples of thisclass. Surface quarrying can generate earthquakes of 2 to 4 [on the Richterscale];52 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn52] deep mining anddeep-well waste disposal 5 to 6 events; and large hydro-reservoirs mid 6 events.Excluding PGF’s there are no earthquakes exceeding 7 confidently consideredinduced. The earthquake magnitude seems to scale with the agent of change ofcrustal stresses: great ice-sheets can induce great earthquakes.53[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn53]Now a characteristic of the Richter scale, not widely understood by those wholive outside earthquake zones, is that it is calibrated so that each increase ofone unit represents a tenfold increase in the magnitude of the quake.54[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn54] So a 2 is ten times bigger than a1, a 3 is ten times bigger than a 2, a 4 is 10 times bigger than a 3, and so on.The earthquake that hit Kobe in Japan on 17 January 1995, killing more than 5000people in twenty seconds, measured 7.2.55[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn55] With a Richter scale value of8.2, the Parvie quake was ten times bigger than Kobe. The largest earthquakesever recorded on the scale – rare events in subduction zones under oceans orbetween continental plates – have not exceeded the value of 9.56[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn56]The clear implication of Arvidsson’s and Johnston’s research, therefore, is thatcrustal rebound and isostatic rebalancing did at times take place very rapidlyas the ice-caps melted down into cascading floods – rapidly enough to triggerextremely violent earthquakes and sudden massive faulting (penetrating tohitherto unheard-of depths of 40 kilometres and radiating laterally for up to160 kilometres).57 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn57] Writing up hisfindings in Science magazine, Arvidsson concludes:I interpret the earthquakes as signs of a progressive rapid rise of the landfrom the centre of postglacial rebound … to the outer reaches of the ice-sheet …More than 9000 years ago a nearly isostatic equilibrium was reached due to thedepression of the lithosphere by the ice. After a quick removal of the ice-sheeta non-isostatic condition caused compressional stresses within the crust whichtriggered the earthquakes.58 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn58]Since the Parvie is only one of many giant post-glacial faults associated withthe collapse of the Fennoscandian ice-sheet, what Arvidsson is really talkingabout – I think – is the descent of hell in northern Europe for a reign of 1000years centred on 8000 years ago. As we follow his evidence, we must envisageextraordinary scenes of geological turmoil in which continuous deep tremorsvibrate all the way through the Baltic Shield crust and the earth repeatedlyroils, fractures, rears up and collapses – seemingly about to tear itself apart… While this is happening the ancient ice-cap over Fennoscandia is in a state ofrunaway meltdown, close now to the point of total collapse, and huge chunks ofdecaying ice the size of islands are falling into the sea, generatingcataclysmic displacement waves. The ice-cap over North America is behaving inmuch the same way …And let’s not forget that the earth by this time – 8000 years ago – has alreadysuffered the consequences of 7000 years of intense volcanism, 7000 years ofrising sea-levels and sudden and unpredictable marine floods, 7000 years ofcontinental shelves, land-bridges and islands vanishing beneath the waves, and7000 years of spectacular climatic instability. Indeed, thepalaeo-climatological record testifies to all of the following – and much more –between 15,000 and 8000 years ago: cold oceans, high winds, mountains of dust inthe atmosphere59 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn59] and wildlyunpredictable temperature shifts.60[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn60]To give an example of the latter, Romuald Schild of the Polish Academy ofSciences cites an abrupt warming that took place in the northern Atlantic ataround 12,700 years ago, stopped and equally abruptly went into reverse 10,800years ago – when there was a sudden 800-year plunge to almost full glacialtemperatures – then turned again to another episode of abrupt warming about10,000 years ago.61 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn61] Robert Schochreports that the bulk of the first warming ‘approximately 27 degrees Farenheit,a massive increase’ – occurred after 11,700 years ago:Remarkably, the ice-core data suggests that half of the temperature change, inthe neighbourhood of 14 degrees Farenheit, occurred in less than 15 yearscentring around 9645 BC. That’s a bigger temperature increase, and faster, thanthe scariest doomsday scenario about global warming in the twenty-firstcentury.62 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn62]It also happens to coincide, almost exactly, with Plato’s date of around 11,600years ago for the sinking of Atlantis, when, the reader will recall, ‘There wereearthquakes and floods of extraordinary violence, and in a single dreadful dayand night … the island of Atlantis was … swallowed up by the sea andvanished.’63 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn63]‘YOU REMEMBER ONLY ONE DELUGE …’I’m not trying to ‘find’ Atlantis, or even to guess where it might have beenlocated – if it ever existed at all – since it is well known that such inquirieslead to madness. I prefer to treat it like any other archaic flood account,whether in the form of myth or purporting to be history, and to consider itsolely in terms of its general level of plausibility – a task made easier by itsunusual detail and precision. What it tells me at that level is at least thefollowing: 1. A devastating global flood occurred around 11,600 years ago. This is interesting, the date coincides with the second of John Shaw’s super-floods and with Cesare Emiliani’s data from the Gulf of Mexico. 2. The flood was accompanied by enormous earthquakes. This is plausible because of the close correlation between huge earthquakes, enhanced volcanism, rapid ice melting, and fast post-glacial flooding. 3. The island of Atlantis was swallowed up by the sea and vanished in a day and a night. We have seen how isostatic rebalancing sometimes occurred very rapidly and cataclysmically at the end of the last Ice Age and how it is theoretically possible that intense isostatic subsidence in a suitably weakened area of the earth’s crust could have brought about just such a sudden collapse as Plato describes.There is one further element of the story that also resonates with scientificevidence, and this is that the flood that destroyed Atlantis 11,600 years agowas but one of many floods …Remember that the source of the Atlantis tradition is supposed to have been anancient Egyptian priest, in conversation with Plato’s ancestor Solon. Here’s howPlato reports the exchange in the Timaeus:Egyptian priest: Oh Solon, Solon, you Greeks are all children, and there’s nosuch thing as an old Greek.Solon: What do you mean by that?Egyptian priest: You are all young in mind, you have no belief rooted in oldtradition, and no knowledge hoary with age. And the reason is this … With you,and others, writing and the other necessities of civilization have only justbeen developed when the periodic scourge of the deluge descends and spares nonebut the unlettered and the uncultured – so that you have to begin again likechildren, in complete ignorance of what happened in early times … You rememberonly one deluge, though there have been many …64[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn64]As a general synopsis, I have to say that the priest’s comments fit reasonablywell with the three global superfloods and countless lesser deluges that we nowknow did occur at approximately 15,000, 11,000 and 8,000 years ago. Moreover,his placing of the Atlantis flood anywhere in this period (the only period inthe last 125,000 years when there actually were floods of the kind described) is– if you stop to think about it – quite an achievement in itself.AN AGGRESSIVE LITTLE BUGGER FROM YORKSHIRE …We’ve seen that it was Cesare Emiliani who first drew serious attention to thepossibility of post-glacial superfloods. In a paper published in Sciencemagazine in 1975, he and a group of colleagues presented startling evidence fromdeep-sea cores from the north-eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. The evidencerevealed ‘a 2.4 per cent isotopic anomaly between 12,000 and 11,000 years ago’,which the authors correctly interpreted as having been caused by ‘the occurrenceof major flooding of ice meltwater into the Gulf of Mexico … centring at about11,600 years before the present’.65[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn65]At the time Emiliani’s ideas were not well received. As Isaac Asimov was laterto comment: ‘The suggestion was largely ignored because it was difficult toimagine the ice melting that fast, but in 1989, John Shaw … made a suggestion asto just how such floods might come about …’66[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn66] I thought that I had alreadyfully understood Professor Shaw’s catastrophic scenario of how the three greatdeluges were caused by sudden releases into the world ocean of pent-up meltwaterfrom behind ice dams. But as I looked more closely at his research, and at thetranscript of the lengthy interview he had given us in February 1999, I began torealize that his story had hidden complexities and that the cataclysms hedescribed could have been far more severe than I had initially supposed. For itwas not just a matter of very rapidly rising seas submerging and washing awaylow-lying coastal areas – although there was an immense amount of that! – butalso of the true character and extent of the run-off floods on land as theice-caps melted down and the glacial lakes burst their ice barriers.Shaw’s interest in this problem does not begin with floods but with drumlins:Drumlin: elliptical, streamlined hill composed of till [unstratified glacialdeposit consisting of boulder clay and rock fragments of various kinds]deposited beneath moving glacial ice. Drumlins commonly are found in clusterswith their long axes roughly parallel to the direction of the ice movement. Theyslope steeply in the direction from which the glacier came and gently in thedirection in which it moved. They vary in height from 6 to 60 metres and inlength up to several miles … Drumlin fields may contain as many as 10,000drumlins; one of the largest fields is in the north-western plains of Canada.67[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn67]Based at the University of Alberta, Professor Shaw has Canada’s drumlins at hisdoorstep, at least in a manner of speaking, so it’s not surprising – as ageologist – that he should have views about them. But the reactions that hisviews have elicited amongst other geologists are harder to understand:When I go to conferences, people yell at me, people get angry and they yell andscream, and are constantly bringing in diversions because they don’t want thestory to be told. And being an aggressive little bugger from Yorkshire anyway, Itend to fight back.68 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn68]At a recent conference in Sweden a senior Quaternary geologist instructed Shaw:‘Don’t bring your ideas here’:So I looked at him and grinned, and next day I gave the paper. And then it wasrejected and not published in the conference proceedings so I put it on the Net,and that’s where it is now … If I were a young assistant professor I wouldn’t bekept and I wouldn’t have published either and people would say my ideas werebarmy.69 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn69]What, one might ask, is all the fuss about? It seems hard to believe thatgeologists could come close to excommunicating such a senior and widelyrespected colleague as Professor Shaw simply for expressing an originalscientific opinion on the matter of elliptical, streamlined hills. I mean, whocares?In fact, we should care, says Shaw, because the drumlins and other ‘hummocky’landforms strewn across Canada are evidence of continental floods of biblicalproportions – floods of water in some cases hundreds of metres high-that roaredout from beneath the ice-caps during the last deglaciation, destroying ormangling everything in their path. Shaw explicitly suggests that many elementsof the universal myth of the deluge may be explained by such floods pouring downoff the land – intimately linked, as they were, to the episodes of sudden andferocious sea-level rise that took place between 15,000 and 8000 years ago.70[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn70]SLOW AND GENTLE OR FAST AND FURIOUS?Although there is no single explanation for the formation of drumlins to whichall geologists subscribe, most see them as the result of a relatively slowsubglacial process involving first the lodgement of a huge mass of ‘till’ on thebedrock beneath the glacier and subsequently its moulding into the classic‘streamlined-hill’ shape by the flow of the ice itself.71[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn71] Such gradualistic theories havedominated the earth sciences and archaeology since the end of the nineteenthcentury, creating an exceptionally difficult environment in both disciplines forthe exploration of alternative hypotheses requiring any kind of sudden change orcatastrophic agency. Because John Shaw’s theory requires both, it was inevitablethat it would face stern opposition. Nevertheless, he has stuck to his gunssince first putting his ideas forward in the 1980s and has gradually seen aconvergence of evidence building up in his favour, including ‘subglaciallandforms, surface water isotopic composition of the Gulf of Mexico, and thesedimentology of cores from the Gulf’.72[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn72]At risk of reducing a massively documented and complex argument to statements ofludicrous simplicity, I think it is fair to say that Shaw himself does not claimto have found any definitive, all-inclusive explanation for the formation ofdrumlins but believes them to be features that are caused in different ways bydifferent kinds of cataclysmic floods and not, as has traditionally beenthought, by ice moulding. For example, ‘on the evidence of form and structure’,his interpretation of the Livingston Lake drumlins in northern Saskatchewan isthat they are ‘infills of inverted erosional marks scoured in the ice-bed bysubglacial meltwater’.73 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn73] In otherwords, forget about the old notions of ‘lodgement’ and ‘moulding’ thatgenerations of geologists have had hard-wired into their logic-circuits.Consider the possibility, instead, that the end of the Ice Age was much lessgenteel – as, indeed, we already know that it was in almost every othermeasurable characteristic that we have encountered – and that the vastdrumlin-fields at Livingston Lake were created by apocalyptic meltwater floods.This is precisely Shaw’s scenario and he believes that the ‘subglacialland-forms’ – i.e. the drumlins themselves – are his most powerful evidence:When I first looked at drumlins – this is how it all started for me really – Ithought, My, they look just like erosional forms on the sea-bed – which arenegative forms of course – but these ones are positive. How can that be? Thenthe idea came to me, OK, if you erode upwards into the ice and then fill in thecavities with sediment that’s what you would get. And so we went and dug holesand found out that the sediment corresponded to filling in from below and verycatastrophically.74 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn74]In brief, Shaw’s argument is that at certain stages during the collapse of theLaurentide ice-sheet between 15,000 and 8000 years ago, parts of the slowlymoving ice-mass – more than 3 kilometres thick and weighing as much as a giantmountain range – must have rested not on bedrock but on a deep layer ofmeltwater moving at high speed and under enormous pressure. These‘turbulent-flows’ would have carried with them tremendous volumes of sedimentranging from finely grained clays to huge stones and boulders, and it is easy tosee how a cavity eroded into the base of the ice-mass – where it rested on therunning water – would quickly have become filled up and densely packed withsediment forced in from below. The result, like any object created in a mould,would have taken on the characteristic shape of the mould – which in the case ofthis kind of erosion is streamlined, elliptical and hill-shaped – and might thenhave been sealed within the ice, and carried further by it, until it wasultimately released by generalized melting.75[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn75][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_013_r1.jpg]Different kinds of landforms created by subglacial meltwater floods of varyingdepths. Based on Shaw (1998).Take a few thousand such objects of varying sizes, dump them in northernSaskatchewan, and you have the Livingston Lake drumlin-field.Shaw believes that other drumlin-fields in Canada have been created in adifferent way – again involving glacial meltwater rather than ice, but this timeas a direct erosional agent on bedrock or depositional landforms:Drumlins around Peterborough and Trenton, Ontario, are mainly erosional; theirinternal stratigraphy is relatively undisturbed … Drumlins in Ireland containcomplex glacigenic sequences … The form of these Irish drumlins … is almostentirely erosional.76 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn76]Returning again to his notion of powerful floods running under immense pressureat the base of the ice-sheets, Shaw draws attention to the drumlins of BeverleyLake field in Canada’s Northwest Territory, which he suggests were sculpted bythese floods, and to erosional marks – also caused by floodwater-in the bedrocknear Kingston, Ontario:Concerning the depth of the flow, it is clear that the [Beverley Lake] drumlins… must have been submerged in the formative flow … minimum depths of about 20metres were required … Erosion marks in the bedrock in the Kingston area,Ontario, indicate subglacial meltwater flows that have widths of more than 60kilometres. Spectacular erosional marks along the north shore of Georgian Bay,Ontario, also indicate broad subglacial meltwater flows. On a helicoptertraverse along the north shore of Georgian Bay, a single field of bedrockerosional marks was noted that had a width of at least 50 kilometres … [These]drumlins and erosional marks indicate meltwater floods that were competent toremove the largest boulders … Flow widths, equal to the widths of drumlin anderosional-mark fields, were in the range of 60 to 150 kilometres.77[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn77]I think it is worth re-emphasizing Shaw’s figures, and their implications. He istalking about turbulent, energetic floods 20 metres deep flowing in vortices athigh speed and pressure, under the main ice-sheets, across fronts up to 160kilometres wide. Only floods on such a scale and of such violence could havesculpted the drumlin-fields and hummocky terrain and tortured pitted scablandsof Canada and the United States and carved out other remarkable features such asthe extremely large through valleys – including those containing the FingerLakes – that lie to the south of drumlin-fields in northern New York State.78[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn78] ‘Volumes of water required tosustain such floods’, observes Shaw, ‘would have been of the order of onemillion cubic kilometres equivalent to a rise of several metres in sea-levelover a matter of weeks.’79 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn79]DROWNED CORAL AND FLOATING ICEOf course, when water flows under ice, severing its connection to bedrock, theice begins to move – ‘surge’ is the technical term:Subglacial meltwater sheets with thicknesses of several tens of metres occurredover vast areas of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The decoupling of glaciers fromtheir beds as a consequence of increased water pressure is used increasingly toexplain their rates of sliding. The scale of this process implied here is muchlarger than that considered for modern glaciers. Nevertheless, the effectsshould be similar … In short, the glacier is expected to surge.80[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn80]There is indeed compelling evidence of a series of massive glacial surges at theend of the last Ice Age. These correlate with meltwater pulses and peaks ofsea-level rise, recorded, for example, in ‘drowned’ reefs of Acropora palmatafrom the Caribbean-Atlantic region near the island of Barbados. Acropora is anefficient tracker of rising sea-level because it is a light-loving coral thatdies at depths greater than about 10 metres. The Barbados reefs were drownedthree times at the end of the last Ice Age – at approximately 14,000, 11,000 and8000 years ago81 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn81] – and sosuddenly and deeply on each occasion that they now form three distinct steps,one for each flooding peak (rather than having crept towards shallower water aswould have been the case with more gradual sea-level rises). Shaw and hiscolleague Paul Blanchon at the University of Alberta conclude in a 1995 paper inGeology that the reef data confirm:three catastrophic, metre-scale sea-level rises during deglaciation. Byconverting radiocarbon-dated marine and ice-sheet events to a siderealchronology we show that the timing of these catastrophic rises is coincidentwith ice-sheet collapse, ocean-atmosphere reorganization and large-scalereleases of meltwater.82 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn82]There is also evidence that a cataclysmic feedback mechanism may have been atwork between even relatively small eustatic sea-level rises due to meltwateralone and much larger and more sudden events caused by the destablization ofentire ice-sheets extending over continental shelves.83[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn83] Indeed, in an article in Nature,geologists D. R. Lindstrom and D. R. Macayeal go so far as to identify ice-sheetmechanics ‘as a controlling factor in meltwater production’.84[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn84] They then make the very radicaland original suggestion that:sudden and significant changes in sea-level due to the floating of formerlygrounded ice-sheets and attendant ice-dome drawdown might have accompanied themeltwater pulses and these ‘jumps’ in sea-level might not have been recorded inthe reef accretion data. Thus a logical mechanism exists by which sea-level mayhave risen faster and to higher levels than represented by the reef-accretionhistories at Barbados.85 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn85]In other words global floods that already appear to have been extremely suddenand severe on the basis of the coral-reef data alone – and each ‘drowning’ eventrequired a minimum instantaneous sea-level rise of 5 metres before it would takeeffect86 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn86] – may temporarily havebeen several magnitudes more severe than the coral-reef record shows. Shaw andBlanchon suggest that a global eustatic hike in sea-level of between justtwo-tenths and four-tenths of a metre in a period of a few weeks would have been‘sufficient to free grounded ice and stimulate further ice-sheet wasting,additionally elevating sea-level on the order to 5 to 10 metres or more’.87[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn87]ARMADAS OF ICEBERGSInduced by sudden sea-level rises, such sudden wasting at the sea-margins of theice-sheets would have manifested in equally sudden launchings of fleets ofgigantic icebergs. In 1988 the German oceanographer Hartmut Heinrich was thefirst to come up with the firm geological evidence for such a cataclysmic‘iceberg-calving’ process during the last Ice Age. By examining deep-sea drillcores sampled at various points across the North Atlantic he demonstrated theexistence of widely dispersed layers of ‘ice-rafted detritus’ – millions oftonnes of rocks and rocky debris that had once stood on land, that had beenclawed up by the ice-sheets and that had ultimately been carried out to seafrozen into huge icebergs:As they melted they released rock debris that was dropped into the fine-grainedsediments of the ocean floor. Much of this ice-rafted debris consists oflimestones similar to those exposed over large areas of eastern Canada today.The Heinrich layers as they have become known, extend 3000 kilometres across theNorth Atlantic, almost reaching Ireland.88[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn88]The Heinrich layers record at least six separate discharges of ‘stupendousflotillas of ice-bergs’89 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn89] intothe North Atlantic – discharges that are now known, obviously enough, as‘Heinrich Events’ and that are thought to have unfolded in concentrated burstsof activity that may, in each case, have lasted less than a century.90[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn90] Because of the progressivethickening of the Heinrich layers towards the western side of the Atlantic andthe continuation of this trend into the Labrador Sea in the direction of HudsonBay, it is obvious to geologists that ‘much of the floating ice was sourced fromthe Laurentide ice-sheet’.91 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn91]However, other debris has been found intermingled in some Heinrich layers that‘could only have come from separate ice-sheets covering not only Canada, butGreenland, Iceland, the British Isles and Scandinavia’.92[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn92] Likewise, research into southernhemisphere ice-caps in the Andes and New Zealand shows that these too ‘grew andthen collapsed synchronously with the ice-rafting pulses recorded in the NorthAtlantic’.93 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn93] The implication,admits Professor R. C. L. Wilson of Britain’s Open University, is that some‘global rather than regional forcing of climate change’ must have been atwork.94 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn94]With this reminder of the interconnectedness of all the great ice-sheets of thelast glaciation – and the broad similarities of all their biographies – let’stake a closer look at one of them. What happened to it also happened, to a verysimilar degree, to all of the others. Its apocalypse is therefore the end of theIce Age in cameo.LAURENTIDEThomas Crowley and Gerald North, oceanographers at Texas A&M University,describe the melting of the great ice-sheets at the end of the last Ice Age as‘one of the most rapid and extreme examples of climate change recorded in thegeologic record’.95 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn95] As we haveseen, most of the changes were concentrated into a period of just 7000 yearsbetween 15,000 and 8000 years ago. Like the other ice-sheets, the Laurentide didnot really go into meltdown until after 15,000 years ago, and like the others itexperienced three primary episodes of collapse correlating closely withProfessor Shaw’s three global superfloods (at approximately 15,000, 11,000 and8000 years ago).It is known that an immense meltwater reservoir in the Laurentide ice-sheet wascatastrophically released between 15,000 and 14,000 years ago:The volume of water discharged produced regional-scale fields of drumlins,giant-flutings and extensive tracts of scoured bedrock. Such large amounts ofmeltwater could potentially destabilize ice sheets grounded below sea-level.96[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn96]The period between 13,000 years ago down to about 10,000 years ago saw recurrentoutburst-flooding from a series of glacial lakes and lake complexes in theLaurentide – notably glacial Lake Agassiz which ‘periodically emptied into theGulf of Mexico via the Minnesota spillway and the Mississippi drainage basin’.97[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn97] The reader will recall Emiliani’sevidence for a peak flooding event of Laurentide meltwater into the Gulf ataround 11,600 years ago. Within a thousand years of that date glacial LakeMissoula (in Montana in the western United States) also underwent one of itsperiodic outbursts, sending what Crowley and North calculate to have been ‘awall of water 600 metres high on to the Columbia plateau of easternWashington’.98 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn98]Another series of large outburst floods occurred around 9400 years ago.According to Charles Fletcher and Clark Sherman of the Department of Geology andGeophysics at the University of Hawaii, each event added an estimated 4000 cubickilometres of water to the world ocean.99[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn99] By 8400 years ago yet morecalamitous melting had allowed Lake Agassiz to merge with its formerly separate(and almost equally massive) eastern neighbour, Lake Ojibway. This confluencecreated a titanic inland sea, with a surface area of more than 700,000 squarekilometres, poised behind an ice dam over Hudson Bay at elevations of between450 and 600 metres above sea-level.100[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn100]At some point between 8400 and 8000 years ago the dam broke and the almostunimaginable mass of water burst through and emptied almost instantaneously intothe North Atlantic:The breakout occurred into the Hudson Bay lowland, lowering lake level by atleast 250 metres and resulting in a total discharge of between 75,000 and150,000 cubic kilometres, possibly the single largest flood of the QuaternaryPeriod.101 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn101]This outburst may have single-handedly raised global sea-level by half a metreor so. But this is a good place to remind ourselves that the spiralling decayand collapse of the Laurentide ice-sheet was not an isolated event but was partof a global pattern and feedback system – and that floods of almost equalmagnitude poured in tandem off the Fennoscandian ice-sheet on the other side ofthe Atlantic Ocean. This is why, at around the same time as the collapse of theLaurentide, the north-eastern side of Britain close to the Fennoscandian marginsalso experienced severe flooding. Here there was a very rapid rise in sea-levelwhichsubmerged an area in the North Sea the size of modern Britain … Most of this100,000 square mile British ‘Atlantis’ [not to be confused with Koudriavtsev’ssuggested site of Atlantis on the Celtic Shelf] was there in 8000 BC and gone by6500 BC. By then only a 140 mile long, 5000 square mile island, where the DoggerBank is now, survived.102 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn102]The separate meltwater floods originating in different ice-caps would, ofcourse, have mingled in the world ocean and multiplied their effects by floatingand breaking up grounded ice on the continental shelves. Stephen Oppenheimercalculates that the ice ‘flushed out through the Hudson Strait’ from what hadonce been the centre of the Laurentide ice-dome between 8400 and 8000 years agomay have been as much as ‘1.6 kilometres thick and a third the size ofCanada’.103 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn103]Such statistics beggar the imagination and require common sense to rebel againstwhat is still very much the establishment view – namely that the sea-level risesat the end of the last Ice Age – though large overall – were too small on ayear-by-year basis to have caused cataclysmic flooding, and thus to haveinspired global flood myths, or to be of any relevance at all to traditions oflost civilizations and antediluvian cities.Although very few historians are presently taking any interest, the geologicaland oceanographic evidence has begun to turn against this ‘gradualist’ and‘uniformitarian’ view of the meltdown, and there are more and more reasons tosuspect that ‘the world of men’, as Plato’s Athenian comments in the passagefrom the Laws quoted at the beginning of this chapter, might indeed have oftenbeen ‘destroyed by floods … in such a way that only a small portion of the humanrace survived’.ENTERING THE REALM OF THE UNKNOWNAt any of the three nodes of peak flooding around 15,000, 11,000 and 8000 yearsago the convergence of evidence suggests very fast global sea-level hikes of theorder of 5–10 metres – and sometimes far more – in each case complicated andexacerbated by induced ice-sheet break-up and other factors. In particular, aswe have seen, experts believe that there may have been several temporary risesin sea-level during these periods – caused by the sudden floating of vast massesof ice – that far exceeded the margins recorded in the oceanographic record.104[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn104]Moreover, rising sea-levels – bringing floods from sea to land – are only partof the story of the end of the last Ice Age. Of at least equal, perhaps greater,importance are the terrible walls of water hundreds of metres high that againand again rolled out from the monstrous ice-domes – and thence over low-lyingland, and from land to sea – when ice dams ruptured and glacial lakes spilled,or when pressurized subglacial meltwater burst from under the ice-sheet.We know that relatively minor sea-level rises could set off major ice-sheetbreak-ups, and it has been suggested by Stephen Oppenheimer that the tremendousearthquakes caused by isostatic rebalancing at the end of the Ice Age could havestirred up ‘mountain-topping superwaves’ in the northern regions of the Atlanticand Pacific Oceans.105 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn105] Otherthan Oppenheimer’s own investigations, however, my impression is that while manybrilliant individual scientists have studied individual post-glacial phenomenain great depth, very little has yet been done to investigate all these phenomenatogether as part of a complex system or to consider the effects on the earth andits human population of multiple, interacting cataclysms – floods, landssubsiding into the sea, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions – all occurring at thesame time.We are entering the realm of the unknown here – because science has onlyrecently begun to consider the end of the last Ice Age as a cataclysm at all andthe evidence is still coming in about just how devastating and extensive thatcataclysm might have been. Nevertheless, some observations that I believedeserve special attention have been made by the researcher Paul LaViolette inhis 1997 book Earth Under Fire:(1) At peak moments of the meltdown any hypothetical civilizations living aroundthe edges of partially enclosed seas that served as drainage areas for the greatice-sheets could have suffered disproportionately large and rapid changes insea-level. In a sophisticated and original argument, LaViolette draws particularattention to the Mediterranean:Glacial meltwater [from the nearby European ice-sheets] would have entered theMediterranean much more rapidly than it could escape through the Straits ofGibraltar, and, as a result, the temporary rise in Mediterranean sea-level wouldhave been much greater than in the surrounding oceans … [Such meltwater surges]could have temporarily raised the Mediterranean by some 60 meters, flooding allcoastal civilizations.106 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn106](2) Mega-avalanches of rock and ice must have repeatedly thundered into theworld’s oceans during the epoch of the meltdown because of the effects ofisostacy on continental margins and the breakaway collapse of the giganticice-sheets. From an example in recent history we know how severeavalanche-induced floods can be. In July 1958 in Alaska’s Lituya Bay ‘ 40million cubic metres of ice and rock weighing 90 million tons, avalanched fromthe glaciated slopes of the Fairweather Range and fell 900 metres into one ofthe bay’s inlets.’ The resulting wave roared inland up the bay’s steep oppositeshore for a distance of more than a kilometre at a speed of 200 kilometres perhour and ‘destroyed ten square kilometres of forests to a height of 540metres’.107 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn107][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_014_r1.jpg]Glacier wave sweeps down side of ice-sheet, growing in height as it descends.Based on LaViolette (1997).What then would have been the effects of the fall into the North Atlantic of asheet of ice a third of the size of Canada?(3) The phenomenon of outburst floods from catastrophically released glaciallakes, already understood to have had apocalyptic regional-scale effects, mayhave been far more severe that previously thought:Ponds and lakes on a glacier’s surface, as well as natural caverns within theglacier, are known to store large quantities of glacial meltwater. From time totime the contents of such reservoirs can discharge suddenly to createpotentially destructive floods called glacier bursts or glacier floods …During periods of intense climatic warning, the Earth’s ice-sheets were meltingextremely rapidly, with most of the melting taking place on their uppersurfaces. Consequently large quantities of meltwater would have collected on theice-sheet surface to form numerous supraglacial lakes perched at elevations ofup to 3.5 kilometres. In cases where the impounded waters were restrained by icejams and where mounting pressures caused these jams to give way, large floods ofglacial meltwater would have poured out over the ice-sheet surface. As one suchglacier burst swept forward, gradually descending the ice-sheet’s surface, itwould have incorporated any ponded meltwater that lay in its path, triggeringthese supraglacial lakes to discharge their contents and add to its size.Through this snowballing effect a single initial glacier burst would haveprogressively grown in size and kinetic energy during the course of its downhilljourney, eventually becoming of mountainous proportions. This so calledcontinental glacier wave would have produced catastrophic floods unlike anythingseen on our planet today …Waves of greater height travel faster. Accordingly, as a glacier wave proceededacross an ice-sheet to lower altitudes, gaining in height and kinetic energy, itwould have accelerated to higher speeds. By the time it had journeyed thousandsof kilometres to the edge of the ice-sheet, it could have attained heights of600 metres or more, a cross-sectional breadth of as much as 40 kilometres, and aforward speed of several hundred kilometres per hour. Such a wave could haveextended thousands of kilometres along the ice-sheet … Glacier waves issuingfrom the surface of ice-sheets in North America, Europe, Siberia and SouthAmerica would have had sufficient kinetic energy to travel thousands ofkilometres over land to devastate regions far removed from the ice-sheet’sboundary. Upon entering the ocean, the wave would have continued forward as atsunami to cause considerable damage on the shores of distant continents.Because of its immense energy, a glacier-wave tsunami would be far moredestructive than any tidal wave observed in modern times.108[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn108]YESTERDAY …There is much that we do not know about what happened to the earth, and tomankind, between 17,000 and 7000 years ago. And though science has made greatstrides towards a fuller understanding of that epoch, there is much that we maynever know. Yet it is to this precise period of unrecorded prehistoric darknessset amidst epic climatic and environmental turmoil that archaeologists trace theorigins of civilization: the first settlements, the first signs of structuredhierarchical communities, the domestication of plants, the invention ofagriculture, building with bricks and stone, etc. – in other words the wholesuite of economic and social attributes that set mankind on the road to scienceand reason and the technological achievements of the modern world.Proper ‘history’ doesn’t begin until after 5000 years ago when we have writtenrecords to go on and thus the basis to build up a reasonably accurate picture ofpast events – although even then there are huge gaps. Before 5000 years ago, inthe absence of written records, all we have to light up our collectiveyesterdays are the conjectures of archaeologists based upon theirinterpretations of extremely scanty material evidence elevated from tiny areasof archaeological sites that become more and more scarce the further we go backin time. And almost all of these sites, of course, are on land. Thus far thecontribution of marine archaeology to the debate has been risible. So this isthe flimsy, hopelessly incomplete, and wholly inadequate basis on which we restour understanding of the unwritten past and passively accept, as though we aredrugged or senseless, that there is no mystery in it."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOINDIA (1)"},{"pageContent":"4 / FORGOTTEN CITIES, ANCIENT TEXTS AND AN INDIAN ATLANTISThe lasting gift bequeathed by the Aryans to the conquered peoples was neithermaterial culture nor a superior physique, but a more excellent language and thementality it generated … At the same time the fact that the first Aryans wereNordics was not without importance. The physical qualities of that stock didenable them by bare fact of superior strength to conquer even more advancedpeoples and so to impose their language on areas from which their bodily typewas almost completely vanished. This is the truth underlying the panegyrics ofthe Germanists; the Nordics’ superiority in physique fitted them to be thevehicles of a superior language.Vere Gordon Childe, Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology,University of Edinburgh, 1926In the end there is no reason to believe today that there ever was an Aryan racethat spoke Indo-European languages and was possessed of a coherent orwell-defined set of Aryan or Indo-European cultural features.Gregory Possehl, Professor of Anthropology,University of Pennsylvania, 1999The word ‘city’ is etymologically linked to the word ‘civilization’. It istherefore of interest that mankind’s first cities have been traced by historiansto the following regions and dates: (1) Mesopotamia, late fourth and early thirdmillennia BC; (2) Egypt, late fourth and early third millennia BC; (3) India,late fourth and early third millennia BC; (4) China, mid-second millennium BC;(5) Central and South America, mid-second millennium BC.In four of the five regions – Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and the Americas-nothingremains of these ancient civilizations except their extraordinary stonemonuments together with more or less incomplete collections of theirinscriptions, legends and traditions. These, by good fortune, have come down tous and have proved amenable to translation. But the cultures that created themonuments and the scriptures are long gone and thus inaccessible to study-exceptthrough inference and deduction from the material remains they left behind.In the fifth region, the Indian subcontinent, matters are very different. Herethe oldest cities are ascribed to the ‘Indus Valley civilization’. It wasforgotten by history and unknown to archaeologists until the 1920s, when thefirst two sites to be discovered – Harappa and Mohenjodaro on the Indus river inwhat is now Pakistan – were excavated and found to be about 5000 years old. Itis because of the location of these two ‘type sites’ that the name ‘Indus Valleycivilization’ was coined – while at the same time the characteristic ‘BronzeAge’ archaeological assemblage of this civilization was referred to as‘Harappan’ – since Harappa was the first site to be explored. Subsequentexcavations, continuing today, have led to the realization that the majority ofthe approximately 2600 ‘Harappan’ sites so far discovered in fact lie outsidethe Indus valley, particularly to the east along the course of the ancientSarasvati, a river that has been dry for almost 4000 years. This widedistribution of sites has been recognized by scholars, many of whom now preferto speak of the ‘Indus-Sarasvati civilization’ – the term that I shall generallyuse here, since it more accurately describes the very large geographicalcatchment area in which this mysterious culture flourished.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_015_r1.jpg]It was an architectural culture, carrying out prodigious feats of civilengineering and building its gigantic cities out of bricks so strong, so uniformand so well made that even after thousands of years they could safely be reusedon modern construction projects (something that happened frequently in thenineteenth and early twentieth centuries before Harappa and Mohenjodaro wererecognized as archaeological sites). The Indus-Sarasvati civilization was alsothe first in the world to experiment with ‘New Towns’ – towns literally plannedand built from scratch, according to a blueprint – the first to institutescientifically designed urban sanitation systems and the first to build anefficient tidal dock.It was a literate culture. Altogether, some 4200 objects – mainly pottery andseals made from steatite and terracotta – have been found bearing theIndus-Sarasvati script. Many of the seals are inscribed in ‘mirror image’ (so asto produce a positive impression when stamped, for example, into damp clay) andare thought to have been used by merchants to brand-mark their goods. Theearliest inscribed seal (excavated in Harappa) dates to 2600 BC while thepottery is a little older. The average inscription contains five signs, thelongest twenty-six, and there are many with just one sign. Despite the bestefforts of the world’s leading linguists, it has not proved possible totranslate any of inscriptions (although quite a number of translations have beenattempted and then rejected by the academic community). There is, however, ageneral consensus that the script, as presently known ‘emerged as a fully-formedsystem of abstract signs called graphemes … After careful comparison of all thesigns, most scholars agree that there are between 400 and 450 different signs orgraphemes.’1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn1] The mature form ofthe script, in other words, appears suddenly in the archaeological record sometime before 2600 BC. There are no indications of evolution or development. Oneday it wasn’t there, next day it was.How is this to be explained?A MISSING LITERATUREIt could simply be because the traces of the script’s evolution exist but havenot yet been found by archaeologists, or that such traces once existed but havenow all been destroyed. It could be that the script did not ‘evolve’. Perhaps itwas invented and introduced all at once, a bit like the script for thepreviously unwritten Somali language that was invented in the 1960s andintroduced in the Horn of Africa in 1972.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn2] Or it could be that theIndus-Sarasvati civilization did not regard written documents as a suitablemedium in which to preserve its great literary and religious compositions. WhatI mean to suggest by this is the possibility that the Indus-Sarasvati scriptmight have been devised to serve strictly limited commercial and bureaucraticfunctions such as labelling merchandise, naming the owners of goods, naming thecontents of pots, etc. It could be that the nature of the society was such thatit would have been regarded as a desecration to use the script to write downanything that was revered or sacred like a wonderful story from antiquity or theprayers, hymns and recitations used in religious services.To live in the twenty-first century is to live in a world in which it isincreasingly difficult to imagine how any kind of civilization could existwithout large-scale written communications. We regard writing as an essentialintellectual skill, as well as the only way to preserve proper long-termrecords. In our society to call someone ‘illiterate’ is therefore an insult;people who do not read and write fluently often have feelings of inadequacy; andthere is widespread unstated agreement that the written word is in itself avirtue, that’s its absence is a curse, and that no high civilization couldpossibly develop without it. This great, universally accepted ‘given’, asunimpeachable as motherhood, is one of the reasons why historians andarchaeologists regard evidence of the introduction and extensive use of writingas amongst the defining characteristics of a ‘civilization’ – to such an extentthat ‘preliterate’ cultures are automatically regarded as much less civilizedthan literate ones.But isn’t this exactly the perspective that one would expect of a highlyliterate technical society looking at the past? Wouldn’t it tend to seek out itsown image there, in however early a form, and define that as ‘civilization’?I believe that this may be what has happened with the vexed issue of theindecipherable Indus-Sarasvati script. The very brevity of the inscriptions(which is part of what makes them so difficult to decipher) means that theycannot have been used to tell complex stories containing numerous details andlarge quantities of information – and I do not think any scholar would disagreewith me on that point.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn3] Yet, to mymind, it is inconceivable that a society so large, so complex, so well orderedand so intelligently run as the Indus-Sarasvati civilization did not possess aliterature, did not possess religious and spiritual compositions, did not havevital sacred records that it wanted to preserve. I am certain that it had allthese things, and since I know that this society understood the principle ofwriting, and indeed had developed a writing system with more than 400 differentsigns, I am not at all inclined to conclude that it did not possess anyinformation of great cultural importance but rather that it must have made adeliberate choice not to use its script to convey such information.A POTION FOR REMEMBERING …A clue as to why a civilization might not regard writing as an automatic virtue,and why its leaders might even take an ethical decision to restrict the use ofwriting, has been passed down to us by Plato. In Phaedrus he has Socrates pose arhetorical question: ‘What feature makes writing good, and what inept?’ He thendeclines to give an immediate answer to this question but instead continues:I can tell you what I’ve heard the ancients said … Among the ancient gods … inEgypt there was one to whom the bird called the ibis is sacred. The name of thatdivinity was Theuth [Thoth, the ancient Egyptian god of wisdom], and it was hewho first discovered number and calculation, geometry and astronomy, as well asthe games of checkers and dice, and, above all else, writing.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn4]What the ancients said about Thoth, Socrates reports, was that having inventedwriting he had gone to the god Amon, ‘the King of all Egypt at that time’, andurged him to introduce it amongst the populace, with these words: ‘O King, hereis something that, once learned, will make the Egyptians wiser and will improvetheir memory; I have discovered a potion for memory or wisdom.’ But Amonreplied:O most expert Theuth, one man can give birth to the elements of an art, but onlyanother can judge how they can benefit or harm those who use them. And now,since you are the father of writing, your affection for it has made you describeits effects as the opposite of what they really are. In fact it will introduceforgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it: they will not practise usingtheir memory because they will put their trust in writing, which is external anddepends on signs that belong to others, instead of trying to remember from theinside, completely on their own. You have not discovered a potion forremembering but for reminding; you provide your students with the appearance ofwisdom, not its reality. Your invention will enable them to hear many thingswithout being properly taught, and they will imagine that they have come to knowmuch while for the most part they will know nothing.Later in the discussion Socrates makes it clear that he feels there are certainmatters and certain kinds of information that should not be available to all butshould be limited to ‘those with understanding’:Once it has been written down, every discourse roams about everywhere, reachingindiscriminately those with understanding no less than those who have nobusiness with it, and it doesn’t know to whom it should speak and to whom itshould not …5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn5]These passages in the Phaedrus may be interpreted in many different ways, butone of the things they definitely are is a sturdy defence of the oral traditionand a clear statement that scripts may not, ultimately, be the best way topreserve precious cultural documents. Because a script depends on signs there isalways the possibility that a time will come when those signs will no longer beunderstood (as has indeed happened with the Indus-Sarasvati script today). Insuch a case any knowledge consigned to the future exclusively in the ‘ark’ ofthat script will have been utterly and irredeemably lost. Because a script isaccessible to anybody who reads it means there is no guarantee that compositionsexpressed in it will be delivered only to those whom they are intended for. Ifthe compositions contain sacred material that is aimed exclusively at initiateswithin a cult, for example, and cannot be properly understood without specificinformation possessed by those initiates, then it is probable that suchcompositions – even if they can be ‘translated’ in a literal sense – will appearmeaningless, nonsensical or absurd to outsiders. Last but not least, because ascript eliminates much of the need for memory its introduction in any societywill inevitably lead to a reduction in the value of the science of memory and indue course that science will be forgotten. Memorization is not a highly regardedskill in our society today (and increasingly less so as the years go by), yet itis possible that a powerful memory, developed through discipline and training,could operate as a catalyst to other intellectual and perhaps even spiritualskills which would otherwise lie dormant.By keeping communications within a strictly oral tradition all of these problemscan be avoided. From generation to generation, from initiate to initiatedirectly, the sacred archives (or hymns, or utterances) can be passed down andtheir obscurities explained where necessary, no doubt evolving to some extent asthe language in which they are carried evolves, perhaps even being translatedinto other languages – but always strictly through the medium of the spoken andmemorized word, with suitable interpretation and explanation by a wisepractitioner at hand, never, never, never through the medium of the writtenword.Consider sacred texts that are valuable to ‘advanced’ technological societiessuch as Japan and the United States. In Japan the Nihongi and the Kojiki arerevered for the antiquity and wisdom of the traditions they contain. In theUnited States the Old Testament and the New Testament of the Bible are equallyrevered amongst Christians. But in neither country does more than a tiny handfulof people (if indeed any at all) have these enormous and complicated texts offby heart. In consequence, although they may be found in many householdlibraries, they are not often discussed or consulted by the majority of Japaneseor Americans today.Now, by contrast, consider the case of India with its population of one billion.ALMOST SUPERNATURAL FEATS OF MEMORYUnlike in other big modern industrial nations that have long ago lost all senseof the sacred and all respect for ‘what the ancients said’, the sacred lifestill permeates India through and through to such an extent that an appeal tothe authority of scripture can still settle all disputes. And unlike thecultures of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, China and the Americas, where onlyspectacular fossils of architecture and language remain, the culture of ancientIndia is still vibrantly alive today in the subcontinent and offers as its giftto the present a vast library of archaic rituals, dances, games, ceremonies,festivals and customs as well as an immense oral literature that has not onlybeen preserved and continuously passed on in the memory of sadhus and rishis(sages, wise men) for thousands of years but that is also celebrated, rehearsed,admired and relished in hundreds of thousands of Hindu villages from theHimalayas to the sea.The oldest elements of India’s oral tradition are the Vedas (the word veda means‘knowledge’), consisting of four major samhitas (compilations of hymns): the RigVeda (the most ancient and the most revered), the Sama Veda, the Yajur Veda andthe Atharva Veda. The language used is a very archaic form of Sanskrit, andthere is a great deal of it! The Rig alone has an extent of around 450,000 words(about twice as long as this book) expressed in 1028 hymns made up of 10,589verses.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn6] The total compendium ofthe four samhitas probably runs to almost double that. But what is most amazingabout these hymnodies is not so much their overall length, which is awesome, butthat for most of their history it is probable that no written versions of themever existed – and not because they could not be written down but because thepriests of the Vedic religion that evolved into Hinduism believed that theyshould not be written down but should be kept alive instead in human memory.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn7]The Vedic texts were originally part of an oral literature. They are sruti, or‘Heard’, and Brahmins [the priestly caste in Hinduism] were expected to memorizeall four books, some parts of which were clearly composed and arranged to assistin this learning process. It can be surmised then that there was a period ofcomposition, when new material was added and older verses were edited andchanged. But at some point this flexibility in composition stopped and thepriests defined their text as immutable, not to be changed by one word or evenone syllable, and the slightest mispronunciation or deviation from the canon wasbelieved to be a sacrilege.8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn8]Significantly there is no mention of writing in the Rig Veda. Moreover, evenwhen writing had become widespread in ancient Indian society for other purposes,strict proscriptions continued to be enforced against writing the Vedas down.This ban was respected until about 1000 years ago, from which period theearliest surviving written versions have reached us.9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn9]Gregory Possehl, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania,and one of the world’s leading experts on ancient India and the Indus-Sarasvaticivilization, comments:The Indian Brahmins took the memorization of the Vedas very seriously, anddeveloped means to ensure accuracy and the careful reproduction of the samewords and sounds from generation to generation. Careful, even exact oralreplication of the Vedas was part of the Hindu faith, institutionalized duringthe learning process and maintained through peer observation and pressurethrough the life of a Brahmin. This community of faithful Brahmins was large andthey all went through the same learning process, which was standardized to somedegree. Deviation from the … path of exact replication would have broughtpowerful forces of censure to bear on the offender …There is also good agreement between the written Vedas that exist from Medievaltimes on, and the oral versions. It is thought that the oral tradition may nothave been contaminated by the literate, but we cannot really know for sure.Still, the writing down of the Vedas was not favoured, nor widespread …The noted Sanskritist J. A. B van Buitenen told me that in the eighteenth andnineteenth centuries the Europeans who were learning Sanskrit were impressed bythe fact that no matter where they went in the subcontinent, when they heardBrahmins recite the Vedas they heard the exact same thing. From Peshawar toPondicherry, or Calcutta to Cape Comorin, hundreds of thousands, even millions,of Brahmins who had no direct contact knew these texts in precisely the same way…[There are therefore] some reasons to believe that this oral tradition isdifferent from most, and that what we have today as texts may be remarkablyclose to those of deep antiquity.10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn10]THE PROBLEM OF THE ARYASHow deep? How ancient is the content of the Vedas really? And from whatwellspring of philosophy, insight and religious speculation do they flow?Scholars like Gregory Possehl, with the (almost) unanimous backing of non-IndianIndologists and Sanskritists, believe that the Vedic hymns were ‘codified’ ataround 1200 BC. They admit that the actual compositions must be older than thatbut it is clear that they would be unlikely to accept a date – even forcomposition – that is earlier than about 1500 BC, perhaps begrudgingly 1800 BCin some rare cases.11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn11] Why shouldthis be so when the archaeological record makes it is clear that the secondmillennium BC in India, if not a time of total decay and collapse as it hassometimes been painted, was certainly not a time that was magnificently fruitfulintellectually and does not look like the sort of epoch that would have produceda sublime intellectual creation like the Rig Veda? On commonsense grounds alone,isn’t this enigmatic text, which we will explore in chapter 6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06], at least as likely to have been thework of the equally enigmatic Indus-Sarasvati civilization? And why is it onlynow that such a possibility is beginning to be tentatively explored by somescholars while the majority still won’t even consider it?The answer is that the Vedic peoples are referred to repeatedly in the Rig asthe ‘Aryas’ and that from this a great and sustained error of orthodoxhistorical scholarship was spawned. Even though the adjective ‘Aryan’ in ancientSanskrit actually means ‘noble’ or ‘cultured’ – and therefore the Aryas areessentially ‘the “noble” or “cultured” folk’, and thus as easily a religiouscult as an ethnic group – it was assumed by historians and archaeologists thatthey were a race and that they had invaded India around 1500 BC. Known as the‘Aryan invasion theory’, this error was only brought to light and dropped fromofficial curricula during the last quarter of the twentieth century. Because ithas far-reaching implications, and requires the wholesale rewriting of canonicalacademic texts and standard works of reference, it is the kind of error thathistorians are not normally eager to admit. Yet in this case, to their credit,it is the orthodox scholars themselves who have exposed it.It is not an error that has ever made the headlines. But since the early 1990sit has been increasingly widely discussed in academic journals and books andtaken into account, more or less completely, in all new thinking and teaching onthe subject. So there is no question at all of a cover-up or even of significantdenial by those whose specialisms have been most directly affected or whosepublications in scientific journals are now out of date.THE ARYAN INVASION OF INDIAThe attribution of the Vedas to ‘Aryan invaders’, the date of 1200 BC for thecodification of the Vedas, and the Aryan invasion theory itself can all betraced back to an idea that had already planted roots by the beginning of thenineteenth century. It was then that a number of Western scholars began tonotice that Sanskrit, the classical language in which the Vedas are written, andits modern relatives in north India such as Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujeratiand Sindhi, have extremely close affinities with modern and ancient Europeanlanguages such as Latin, Greek, English, Norwegian and German. How, the scholarsasked themselves, had this amazingly widespread distribution of what are nowknown as the ‘Indo-European’ family of languages come about?Fairly soon a predictable doctrine began to take form. ‘This’, explains GregoryPossehl,had to do with the Aryan race, proposed to be the people who spoke the languagesof the Indo-European family. European intellectual and moral superiority was aforegone conclusion to most savants of the nineteenth and early twentiethcentury. The success of European colonialism, Christianity and the IndustrialRevolution proved that. This condition of innate superiority was seen in theClassical Greeks and to have been carried forward by Rome. With the discovery ofthe Indo-European family of languages there was evidence for an even earlierhistory, one set within a prehistoric past that only archaeology could uncover.The Aryans, or Indo-Europeans, must have been blessed with this ‘superiority’since they too were successful conquerors of vast lands, from the Bay of Bengalto the outer islands of Scandinavia and the United Kingdom.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn12]It was against this ideological background of inevitable European superiority,combined with misunderstood references to the Aryas in the Rig, that thedoctrine of the ‘the Aryan invasion of India’ arose and gained universalacceptance amongst scientists as an event that had taken place at a specificmoment in history and that had involved a mass movement of peoples from aEuropean ‘homeland’ into India.Indeed, the earliest version of this scenario remained widely accepted until thetwentieth century was quite far advanced. It held that India – which before hadbeen inhabited exclusively by dark-skinned aboriginal and Dravidian tribes – wasinvaded from the north-west through the passes of Afghanistan by a light-skinnedand perhaps even blue-eyed European race at some time during the secondmillennium BC. The pale nomadic invaders, mounted on horses, armed with ironweapons and driving fast war chariots, called themselves the ‘Aryas’. Theyrapidly overwhelmed and subjugated the indigenous inhabitants, whosecivilization was at a lower level than their own. At the same time they importedtheir own naturalistic religion – expressed in the Rig Veda – which they imposedon the ‘inferior’ conquered races of India.The second scenario began to take shape after the discovery and excavation ofthe Indus valley sites of Harappa and Mohenjodaro during the 1920s and 1930s. Itrapidly became clear that these sophisticated, centrally planned cities weremuch older than the supposed 1500 BC date for the Aryan invasion of India andthat they belonged to a previously unidentified high civilization of remoteantiquity, perhaps almost as old, it was speculated, as Sumer or Egypt – inother words, dating back to 3000 BC or earlier.Like other resilient bad ideas, the Aryan invasion theory survived what shouldhave been critical evidence against it by adapting. Although the chronology hadto be increasingly stretched to fit in with the new archaeological discoveries,historians were for a long while able to cling on to the notion of an invasionby ‘Aryan’ hordes in the second millennium BC.What changed was the background. Previously, the pale Aryas had overrunprimitive tribes of dark-skinned hunter-gatherers. Now it had to be admittedthat they had overrun a sophisticated urban civilization that had flourished inIndia for at least a thousand years before their arrival and that had been farahead of them in culture but no match for their superior military prowess andtechnology. Previously the Aryas had been the bringers of civilization to abenighted and barbaric India; now they were the destroyers of a far oldercivilization than their own – a literate civilization, moreover, and one thathad clearly been prosperous for a very long time.It was generally agreed that this earlier race of city dwellers had beenDravidians – an ethno-linguistic group, principally represented byTamil-speakers, that is now almost entirely confined to southern India. With nomore evidence than the authoritative (and in this case incorrect) opinion of therevered British archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler concerning a few dozenskeletons thought to display wound marks that had been found at Mohenjodaro,scholars adopted the theory that the invading Aryas had ‘massacred’ theDravidian inhabitants of the Indus-Sarasvati cities, forcibly taken over theirlands and driven the survivors towards the south.Although the massacre theory was later discredited (the skeletons came fromdifferent epochs, showed no signs of fatal wounds, and were not the result ofany one event),13 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn13] the idea of aviolent invasion of India by a non-Indian people calling themselves the Aryassurvived in at least some enclaves of mainstream scholarship into the early1990s – when even its most ardent supporters began to distance themselves fromit. By 1999 the standard texts on the subject had caught up and Gregory Possehlwas able to write the definitive obituary of the Aryan invasion hypothesis inhis massive tome Indus Age:In the end there is no reason to believe today that there ever was an Aryan racethat spoke Indo-European languages and was possessed of a coherent orwell-defined set of Aryan or Indo-European cultural features.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn14]1500 BC OR 15,000 BC?So it is not controversial to state that the top scholars in this field nowaccept, absolutely, that there was no Aryan race and no Aryan invasion.Strangely, however, very few of them seem to have noticed that these conclusionsmust have implications for the history that we ascribe to the Vedas – hithertoassumed to have been composed by the Aryan invaders, and codified by them intothe form that is with us now, during the first few centuries after their arrivalin India around 1500 BC.It turns out that this assumption, which in all logic cannot stand now that thecore idea of an Aryan invasion has been abandoned, is one of the pillars of theorthodox chronology of the Vedas. This dates the codification of the fourprincipal books – the Rig Veda, the Atharva Veda, the Yajur Veda and the SamaVeda – to between 1200 and 800 BC (with the three centuries between 1500 BC and1200 BC allocated to the actual composition of the hymns).The second pillar has to do with metals and the supposed date of the ‘Iron Age’in India. The Rig Veda, which is thought to be the oldest Vedic text, uses ageneral term, ayas, for metal. By the time of the codification of the slightlylater Atharva Veda, however, a new term has been introduced: krsna ayas, meaning‘black metal’. Scholars have taken this to be a reference to iron, and havedrawn very large chronological conclusions from it. Gregory Possehl:There is some content of the Rig Veda that hints at its age. There arereferences made to metals … but not iron. However, by the time of the AtharvaVeda iron is known. This can be used to suggest that the Rig Veda was codifiedprior to the widespread use of iron in northern India and Pakistan and that theAtharva Veda is on the other side of this timeline; nominally 1000 BC orslightly earlier.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn15]Possehl describes this as nothing more than a ‘reasonable or interestingobservation, not a hard and fast historical point’.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn16] This is certainly a wise caution.For example, the metal krsna ayas might have been known in Rig Vedic times butsimply not mentioned in the Rig itself. Or, as a number of authorities haveargued, it may be that krsna ayas has been mistranslated as iron and that someother dark-coloured metal was intended. Or again, with no indication given inthe texts as to how the krsna ayas was acquired or manufactured, it is alsopossible – even if ‘iron’ was intended – that the references are to meteoriticiron (as opposed to man-made smelted or forged iron). This is widely understoodto be the case, for example, with the many references to ‘iron’ – bja – in theancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts (c.2300 BC, long before the Egyptian ‘Iron Age’)and there is no reason from the context why it should not also be so in theAtharva Veda.The third pillar supporting the orthodox chronology of the Vedas, and the onemost relied upon for dating the Vedas today, is a linguistic argumentextrapolated from a ‘feeling’ certain specialized scholars have about the paceat which Sanskrit might have evolved. Gregory Possehl again, setting out theorthodox view as it stood in 1999:Based on the language of the Rig Veda, its vocabulary and grammar, VedicSanskrit can be thought of as the archaic form of this language. TheSanskritists on whose judgement I rely, feel that the date for the codificationof the Rig Veda is not likely to be earlier than 1200 BC nor later than 800 BC.There is some bias toward the later date. These dates are not based on a processof reasoning rich in data and cross-checks. They emerge instead from a sense ofhow rapidly Sanskrit might have changed, using the grammar of Panini (c.5thcentury BC) as a baseline and working backward from this point. There are fewchronological checkpoints in this process and the period between 1200 BC and 800BC emerges as a scholarly judgement; a kind of ballpark guess …17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn17]Possehl then goes on to warn that since ‘this date for the Rig Veda is basedprimarily on language’, it gives at best ‘the approximate date for thecodification of the text, but not for the history that may be represented there,which is certainly earlier; how much earlier is simply not known’.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn18]Likewise, it is surely significant that Max Muller, perhaps the most eminentIndologist of all, and in fact the first Sanskritist to propose a codificationdate of 1200 BC for the Rig Veda, was himself much more hesitant than thegenerations of scholars following uncritically after him, who have allowed thedate of 1200 BC to crystallize into received wisdom. It is clear that Mullerbecame aware during his own lifetime that such a ‘crystallization’ process wasunderway – and that he resisted it. ‘I have repeatedly dwelt on the entirelyhypothetical nature of the dates which I ventured to assign to the first threeperiods of Vedic literature,’ he protested at one point.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn19] Again, in his Gifford Lectures in1890, Muller warned his students that 1200 BC was a purely arbitrary date basedon unproven assumptions about the rate of evolution of Sanskrit: ‘Whether theVedic hymns were composed in 1000 or 1500 or 2000 or 3000 BC no power on earthcould ever fix.’20 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn20] And in hisbook The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy, which describes the Vedas as ‘tombsof thought richer in relics than the royal tombs of Egypt’, Muller cautions:If we grant that they belonged to the second millennium before our era, we areprobably on safe ground, though we should not forget that this is a constructivedate only, and that such a date does not become positive by mere repetition …Whatever may be the date of the Vedic hymns, whether 1500 or 15,000 BC, theyhave their own unique place and stand by themselves in the literature of theworld …21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn21]ALCHEMYDespite Muller’s insistent and repeated caveats, the date of around 1200 BC thathe had once ‘Ventured to assign’ to the codification of the Rig Veda was thedate that stuck. The master himself never saw it as anything more than ahypothesis, but the alchemy of his own prestige and authority transformed itafter his death into a ‘fact’.Such cults of the personalities of great men have converted opinions into factsbefore – usually only for short periods of time until common sense reassertsitself. But Muller’s nineteenth-century hypothesis about Vedic chronology isstill treated as a fact virtually universally in the twenty-first century even,as we have seen, amongst such wise and insightful scholars as Gregory Possehl.To give just one further example out of many that are available to make thepoint, Professor Jonathan Mark Kennoyer of the University of Wisconsin, anotherleading authority on the Indus age, states as fact in his 1998 book AncientCities of the Indus Valley Civilization that:The Rig Veda is a compilation of sacred hymns that was codified in its presentform during the mid-second to first millennium BC at around the same time as theIndus cities were declining …22 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn22]As anyone who knows their work can attest, Kennoyer and Possehl are far frombeing dogmatic about the interpretation of the past. On the contrary, they areamongst a number of really fine thinkers and brilliant field-researchers inuniversities all around the world – not least in India itself and in Pakistan –who are today confronting the enduring riddle of Indian antiquity with aformidable combination of open minds and scientific method. It is important alsoto remind ourselves that they are only proposing codification dates for the RigVeda and fully endorse Muller’s earlier recognition that many of thecompositions within the standardized collections may have had an extremely longprior existence in India’s ancient and fantastically elaborate oral tradition.So while their approach does recognize a date of approximately 1200 BC forcodification, Possehl, Kennoyer and others are advocates of much earlier datesof composition. Kennoyer in particular seems willing to explore the possibilityof continuity between Indus-Sarasvati motifs and the Rig Vedic hymns23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn23] – when not so long ago such aline of thought would have been inconceivable for mainstream scholars.Yet so far neither Possehl nor Kennoyer, nor any other Western Indologist ofwhom I am aware, nor any Western historian, archaeologist, linguist or any otheracademic from any other discipline working in a university outside India itself,has ever seriously considered the possibility that the Indus Valleycivilization, hitherto believed ‘mute’ because its script cannot be deciphered,could in reality have been speaking to us all along through the medium of VedicSanskrit.Having taken two big steps towards such a conclusion – dumping the Aryaninvasion theory, and accepting that the Vedas are likely to be significantlyolder than their date of codification – it is, I think, rather strange thatscholars outside India have not yet been prepared to take the third obviousstep, which would involve giving proper consideration to the possibility thatthe true parent of these orphaned scriptures could be the Indus-Sarasvaticivilization itself rather than the evaporated ‘Aryan invaders’ of the secondmillennium BC.Could it be that the reason for this reluctance is the same as the reason thatthe Aryan invasion theory was allowed to flourish during the colonial era in thefirst place?HOW TO HAVE YOUR ARYAN INVASION AND NOT ADMIT ITThere can be little serious doubt that the evolution and lengthy survival of theAryan invasion theory was underpinned by an ingrained conviction on the part ofEuropean scholars that the presence in India of a ‘superior’ language such asSanskrit that was related to European languages must imply a movement of thatlanguage from Europe to India in remote prehistory rather than from India toEurope.Vere Gordon Childe, Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at the University ofEdinburgh and later Director of the Institute of Archaeology, University ofLondon, was one of the most influential exponents of this gross scholarlyracism. In 1926, while Harappa and Mohenjodaro were actually under excavation,Childe eulogized the ‘gift’ that he believed had been given to India by brawny‘Nordic’ Aryans:The lasting gift bequeathed by the Aryans to the conquered peoples was neithermaterial culture nor a superior physique, but a more excellent language and thementality it generated … At the same time the fact that the first Aryans wereNordics was not without importance. The physical qualities of that stock didenable them by bare fact of superior strength to conquer even more advancedpeoples and so to impose their language on areas from which their bodily typewas almost completely vanished. This is the truth underlying the panegyrics ofthe Germanists; the Nordics’ superiority in physique fitted them to be thevehicles of a superior language.24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn24]Such ideas, endorsed and propagated by the leading archaeologists andethnologists of the time, played a crucial role in the growth of the Nazi cultof ‘Aryan’ racial superiority during the 1930s and 1940s and led, ultimately, tothe abomination of the Holocaust. One would expect, therefore, thatarchaeologists of today would take an entirely different line. This is whatColin Renfrew, Professor of Archaeology at Cambridge University, has to say onthe subject:As far as I can see there is nothing in the Rig Veda which demonstrates that theVedic-speaking population were intrusive [to India]; this comes rather from ahistorical assumption about the ‘coming’ of the Indo-Europeans …25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn25]Renfrew blames Vere Gordon Childe’s contemporary Sir Mortimer Wheeler for thewidespread diffusion and rapid uptake of the ‘invasion’ idea, whichis rooted entirely in assumptions … When Wheeler speaks of ‘the Aryan invasionof the Land of the Seven Rivers in the Punjab’, he has no warranty at all, sofar as I can see. If one checks the dozen references in the Rig Veda to theSeven Rivers, there is nothing in any of them that to me implies invasion: theLand of the Seven Rivers is the land of the Rig Veda, the scene of the action.Nothing implies that the Aryas were strangers there.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn26]Finally Renfrew makes the significant observation that despite Wheeler’s attemptto hold the Aryas responsible for massacres they never committed in theIndus-Sarasvati cities, and to blame them for those cities’ collapse in thesecond millennium BC:It is difficult to see what is particularly non-Aryan about the Indus Valleycivilization, which on this hypothesis would be speaking the Indo-Europeanancestor of Vedic Sanskrit.27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn27]But ultimately Renfrew too turns out to be proposing an Aryan invasion of India– only in a freshly scrubbed, politically correct incarnation. Renfrew’sscenario enables him to keep a non-Indian origin for Sanskrit while abandoningthe now untenable theory of an invasion in the second millennium BC. Hisargument, in the simplest terms, is that the ‘invasion’ was actually a peacefulagricultural ‘migration’ or ‘dispersal’ and that it took place much earlier thanthe second millennium BC – indeed he prefers a date at the beginning of theNeolithic perhaps as much as 9000 years ago.28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn28] In his important studyArchaeology and Language he makes the case that Anatolia (in modern Turkey,occupying the peninsula between the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Aegean)wasa key area where an early form of the Indo-European language was spoken before6500 BC. From there the distribution of the language and its successors intoEurope was associated with the spread of farming … The zone of early farmersspeaking Proto-Indo-European extended east to northern Iran and even toTurkmenia at the outset. The spread of Indo-European speech to the south, to theIranian plateau and to north India and Pakistan, can then be seen as part of ananalogous dispersal, related to demographic changes associated with the adoptionof farming.29 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn29]After their forefathers had arrived in India, Renfrew’s hypothesis has it thatthe descendants of the original Neolithic migrants remained there and developedtheir society and religious ideas in situ for thousands of years. In his viewthey continued to speak an evolving form of the language brought with them fromAnatolia that was to become Sanskrit – in which the Vedas would ultimately becomposed. And although he has not explored the implications further, he clearlyhas no objection in principle to the idea that it was also they who founded theIndus-Sarasvati civilization.TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COINOutside the cosy Pall Mall club of Western scholarship, Indian academics havebeen forthright in contemplating direct links between the Indus-Sarasvaticivilization and the Vedic texts. Like Renfrew, Dr S. R. Rao, famous as thefounder of marine archaeology in India, believes that the language of theIndus-Sarasvati cities was an early form of Vedic Sanskrit – and has even goneso far as to propose a full interpretation on this basis of all known examplesof the Indus-Sarasvati script.30 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn30]A number of other leading scholars, such as Dr R. S. Bisht, Director of theArchaeological Survey of India, and S. P. Gupta, Professor of the History of Artin the National Museum Institute, New Delhi, also have similar ideas.Bisht, for example, has argued that the hierarchical layout of Harappan townswas organized according to the Rig Vedic trimeshthin system which advocatesthree distinct sectors of settlement: Parama-Veshthina (Upper Township),Madhyama-Veshthina (Middle Township) and (Avama-Veshthina) (Lower Township). Healso points out that the Harappan city of Dholavira in Gujerat, which dates backto the third millennium BC, measured 771 metres from east to west at its maximumextent and 616.8 metres from north to south, the ratio being 5:4. The Citadel,or Upper Township, measured 114 metres from east to west while from north tosouth it measured 92.5 metres, the ratio being again 5:4. Bisht does not thinkit is a coincidence that the same ratio is specifically mentioned in ancienttexts setting out the proper construction of Vedic fire-altars.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn31]S. P. Gupta likewise points out that all the key characteristics ascribed to RigVedic religion and culture are already found in the mysterious ancient citiesalong the Indus and Sarasvati rivers. First and foremost amongst thesecharacteristics are the cities themselves – since, contrary to the old view thatthe Vedas portray only a pastoral or nomadic lifestyle, all scholars nowacknowledge that cities are frequently mentioned in the Rig and other Vedictexts as the homes of Aryans. Additional archetypally ‘Vedic’ characteristicsthat have been confirmed by excavation of the Indus-Sarasvati sites include thepresence of cattle and of the domesticated horse, the use of fire-altars, andevidence of widespread international trade and deep-sea navigation. Guptaconcludes:Once it becomes reasonably clear that the Vedas do contain enough material whichshows that the authors of the hymns were fully aware of the cities, city life,longdistance overseas and overland trade, etc., which characterized theIndus-Sarasvati urban gamut of cultural elements, it becomes easier for us toappreciate the theory that the Indus-Sarasvati and Vedic civilizations may havebeen just two complementary elements of one and the same civilization.32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn32]Unlike Renfrew and other Western experts, however, the Indian scholars are notinclined to support any kind of European or central Asian origin for Vediccivilization. Instead, with good reason, they prefer to see it as a whollyindigenous development of their subcontinent – Indian through and through likethe Indus-Sarasvati cities.In this way they have begun the long-overdue process of bringing together one ofthe greatest and most profound spiritual literatures of antiquity with what isarguably the greatest and most remarkable urban civilization of antiquity. Aswell as resolving the paradox of a sophisticated urban culture with a script butno literature, and of a sophisticated literature with no urban culture evidentbehind it, this process has the potential to link the Vedas to known history andprehistory and to definite archaeological remains rather than to vapidspeculations about an ‘Aryan invasion’.Perhaps we are coming to a time when ancient India will speak for herself againafter millennia of silence …MY INDIAN CHILDHOODOn a bright morning in July 1954, when I was three years and eleven months old,I got off a ship in the port of Bombay with my mother and father. We then madean immense journey across India by rail that I remember very little of (althoughI remember the ship very well), and eventually arrived in Vellore in the stateof Tamil Nadu in the far south. There my father took up the post of generalsurgeon at the Christian Medical College Hospital.We lived in a flat on the campus of the CMC with other doctors’ families andmedical staff. We had a verandah to the rear of the flat that overlooked somedistant palm trees at the edge of a field. During the monsoon season, if Iplugged the drains of the verandah, it would fill up with rainwater like aswimming pool. The view of the palm trees bent double in the big winds of themonsoon used to make my heart race and my chest feel tight and I still rememberit now as though it were yesterday.Our flat was on the first floor. There was a dust-patch below in which I oncefound a lizard’s soft-shelled eggs. There was a lily-pond with enormous frogs.And there were trees to climb, including one with a tree-house.I remember often being in Vellore, 5 kilometres away from the campus. SometimesI would be at the CMC Hospital following my dad around. Or I would be at theTamil school I attended at around the age of six where a fellow pupil oncestabbed me in the left forearm with a pencil; I still bear the scar.My father was on a missionary salary in India, so we thought we were as poor aschurch mice. Still, we employed a servant, who must have been a lot poorer thanus. His name was Manikam. I remember he used to bring me my lunch every day in askyscraper of circular aluminium tiffin tins and take me for rides on rickshawsthrough narrow streets jammed with tremendous crowds of people.We had holidays too – Kodai, up in the mountains, where Trixie, my dog, wasbitten by something rabid and had to be put down, and Mahabalipuram, on thecoast just south of Madras, where I learned to swim. Imprinted on my memory foryears afterwards – until I returned there, in fact, and was able to overlay oldmemories with new ones – were images of the eerie rock-hewn temples ofMahabalipuram, overlooking the Bay of Bengal.My childhood encounter with India was formative and I am grateful that I wasintroduced at such an impressionable age to its aura of intriguing andimpenetrable mystery, its velvety warmth and depth, its intense colours, sights,sounds, tastes and smells, its joyous, erotic beauty, its cruelty, its love, itspassion and its never-ending drama of stark contrasts – past and present, sunand storm, desert and meadow, wealth and poverty, life and death …My baby sister Susan was born in India and died less than a year later of somenameless disease. Then my brother Jimmy was born with an immune system so weakthat he could not even fight off the most minor infections. Soon he too wasteetering on the edge of death, his lungs ravaged by Pneumocystis cariniipneumonia – known today as one of the most awful opportunistic infections ofAIDS. So, on a dark night in March 1958, when I was about seven and a half yearsold, I climbed on board an aeroplane with my mother and father and tiny, sad,sickly Jimmy almost invisible inside his portable oxygen tent.And that was it. That was the end of my Indian childhood.We flew back through the darkness. We stopped in Egypt, where I saw an ocean ofsand from the air. We stopped in Zurich. It was snowing and I was bought myfirst-ever bar of Toblerone, a truly unforgettable experience. For a while Isomehow became briefly separated from my father while we were on the ground andhad terrible fears that the plane would leave without me. Finally we landed inLondon, where my parents rushed to Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital in adesperate but ultimately hopeless attempt to save Jimmy. Meanwhile, I was takento Edinburgh by my grandmother. There I became entranced by snow, got soaked andfrozen playing in it and promptly went down with a life-threatening case ofpneumonia.INDIAN ATLANTISMany years later, in the summer of 1992, a letter was forwarded to me by mypublishers from an Indian lady resident in Canada. She had just read my thennewly published book The Sign and the Seal and had noticed that it contains afew pages on the subject of Atlantis and considers the possibility of a lostcivilization destroyed in a flood cataclysm. The reason for her letter was totell me of an Indian tradition, which she rightly thought I might not have heardof, that spoke of something quite similar – a great city that had been swallowedup by the sea thousands of years previously. The name of the city, she said, hadbeen ‘Dwarka’ or ‘Dvaraka’ and it was referred to in India’s sacred texts. Moreinterestingly, a team of Indian marine archaeologists had been to the site whereDwarka was said to have been submerged and had found the remains of giganticwalls and fortifications underwater.At the time I received the letter I was already deeply embroiled with researchfor my next book, Fingerprints of the Gods, (eventually published in 1995) andhalf considering a trip to India anyway. By then I was married to Santha, who isof Tamil origin (although she was born and brought up in Malaysia), and she toowas keen on the idea. But it was the synchronicity and obvious potentialrelevance of the letter from Canada that focused our minds. We agreed that wewould go if the Dwarka story checked out.First I confirmed that there are indeed scriptural references to antediluvianDwarka in ancient Indian texts. There are many. They speak very clearly ofDwarka’s foundation in a bygone age by the god Krishna in human form and of itssubmergence soon after Krishna’s death.Next I looked to see if Dwarka, which the texts clearly locate in north-westernIndia, had any counterpart on land in historical antiquity. I found that notonly did it have such a counterpart but that there is still, today, a sacredcity called Dwarka, which is one of India’s major sites of pilgrimage. It islocated just where it should be, in the state of Gujerat on the north-westerncorner of the Kathiawar peninsula overlooking the Arabian Sea. And as myinformant had correctly indicated, Indian marine archaeologists (led by S. R.Rao) had been diving about a kilometre off-shore and had discovered a very largesubmerged site. Although no datable artefacts had been found, the ruins had beenassigned to the ‘late period’ of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, perhaps aslate as 1700 to 1500 BC.Santha and I didn’t dive in those days but it still seemed worth going to Dwarkajust to get the flavour of the place and see if we could learn anything. So webegan to plan a journey of about five weeks for November and December of 1992.We would go to Pakistan first to visit the world-famous Indus valley cities ofMohenjodaro and Harappa – cities that had traded with Sumer, cities as old asthe Great Pyramid of Egypt. Then we would fly north to Nepal to visit Shanti andRavi, Santha’s two children from her first marriage, who were attending theAmerican School in Kathmandu. From Nepal we would travel to Delhi, the Indianfederal capital, and then east to the state of Orissa to the sacred solartemples of Puri and Konarak on the Bay of Bengal. The next stop would be TamilNadu, so that we could visit Vellore, my childhood home, and explore Santha’sconnections with southern India. From there we would fly to Gujerat and spend aweek in Dwarka.Well it didn’t quite work out that way. The best-laid plans in India almostnever do. Riots and demonic hate-killings between Hindus and Muslims had led toa partial imposition of martial law. At the same time, for entirely unrelatedreasons, the main domestic carrier, Indian Airlines, had gone on strike and wasstranding passengers all over the subcontinent.So although we did in the end reach Dwarka on that trip it was not by air but byroad.THE FLOODING OF DWARKA AND THE DESCENT OF THE KALI AGEIndian thought has traditionally regarded history and prehistory in cyclicalrather than linear terms. In the West time is an arrow – we are born, we live,we die. But in India we die only to be reborn. Indeed, it is a deeply rootedidea in Indian spiritual traditions that the earth itself and all livingcreatures upon it are locked into an immense cosmic cycle of birth, growth,fruition, death, rebirth and renewal. Even temples are reborn after they growtoo old to be used safely – through the simple expedient of reconstruction onthe same site.Within this pattern of spiralling cycles, where everything that goes aroundcomes around, India conceives of four great epochs or ‘world ages’ of varyingbut enormous lengths: the Krita Yuga, the Treta Yuga, the Davapara Yuga and theKali Yuga. At the end of each yuga a cataclysm, known as pralaya, engulfs theglobe in fire or flood. Then from the ruins of the former age, like the Phoenixemerging from the ashes, the new age begins.And so it goes on – birth, growth, fruition, death, rebirth – endlessly acrosstime. At the end of each cycle of four ages there is a super-cataclysm and thena new cycle of yugas begins.Each cycle and each yuga within a cycle is believed in India to possess its ownspecial character: the Krita Yuga is a golden age ‘in which righteousnessabounds’. The Treta Yuga that follows sees a decline and ‘virtue falls short’.In the Davapara Yuga ‘lying and quarrelling expand, mind lessens, truthdeclines’. In the Kali Yuga ‘men turn to wickedness and value what is degraded,decay flourishes and the human race approaches annihilation’.The story of Dwarka is tightly intertwined with this scheme of things. Reportedin the ancient Indian epic known as the Mahabaratha (thought to have beencomposed a few hundred years after the Rig Veda) and in later sacred texts suchas the Bhagvata Purana and the Vishnu Purana, it straddles two of the greatworld ages.Towards the end of the most recent Davapara Yuga, the texts tell us, Dwarka wasa fabulous city founded on the north-west coast of India. Established and ruledover by Krishna (a human avatar of the god Vishnu), it was built on the site ofan even earlier sacred city, Kususthali, on land that had been reclaimed fromthe sea: ‘Krishna solicited a space of twelve furlongs from the ocean, and therehe built the city of Dwarka, defended by high ramparts.’33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn33] The gardens and the amenities ofthe city are praised, and we understand that it was a place of ritual andsplendour.Years later, however, as the Davapara Yuga comes to an end, Krishna is killed.The Vishnu Purana reports: ‘On the same day that Krishna departed from the earththe powerful dark-bodied Kali Age descended. The ocean rose and submerged thewhole of Dwarka.’34 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn34] The Age ofKali thus ushered in turns out to be none other than the present epoch of theearth – our own. According to the Hindu sages it began just over 5000 years agoat a date in the Indian calendar corresponding to 3102 BC.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn35] It is an age, warns the BhagvataPurana, in which ‘people will be greedy, take to wicked behaviour, will bemerciless, indulge in hostilities without any cause, unfortunate, extremelycovetous for wealth and wordly desires …’36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn36]"},{"pageContent":"5 / PILGRIMAGE TO INDIAMahabalipuram became soon celebrated beyond all the cities of the earth; and anaccount of its magnificence having been brought to the gods assembled at thecourt of Indra, their jealousy was so much excited at it that they sent ordersto the God of the Sea to let loose his billows and overflow a place whichimpiously pretended to vie in splendour with their celestial mansions. Thiscommand he obeyed, and the city was at once overflowed by that furious element,nor has it ever since been able to rear its head.William Chambers, The Asiatic Researches, vol. 1, 1788On the same day that Krishna departed from the earth the powerful dark-bodiedKali Age descended. The ocean rose and submerged the whole of Dwarka.Vishnu PuranaIt is a curious thing that if one wishes to select a date that truly does seemto mark the beginning of some kind of ‘new age’ in the Indian subcontinent, thenit would have to be around about 3100 BC – the epoch traditionally signalled asthe beginning of the Kali Yuga. It was at this time, at any rate, along theriver valleys extending down from the Karakoram and Himalayan mountain ranges,that the largest urban civilization of antiquity began to stir. As we have seenit would later be called the Indus Valley civilization, or the Indus-Sarasvaticivilization.At its peak around 2500 BC this mysterious prehistoric culture boasted at leastsix large inland cities – others may yet await discovery – with populations inexcess of 30,000. These urban hubs were linked to hundreds of smaller towns andvillages and to several key ports like Lothal and Dholavira at strategiclocations along its coastline and up its navigable rivers. Its borders enclosedan area larger than western Europe – 1.5 million square kilometres, extendingfrom Iran in the west and Turkmenia and Kashmir in the north to the Godavarivalley in the south and beyond Delhi in the east.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn1] It also had outposts overseas,including a once thriving colony in the Persian Gulf, and it had an extensivetrading network supported by a large merchant navy.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn2]In November 1992, when Santha and I boarded the PIA flight from London toKarachi, I had heard enough about the ‘Indus Valley civilization’ (the only nameby which I knew it then) to be intrigued by it, but was ignorant about thedetails. Like most people who know of it at all I identified it only with thefirst two sites to be excavated – Harappa and Mohenjodaro – which had attractedworldwide headlines and won everlasting renown when they were discovered in the1920s.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_016_r1.jpg]Based on Possehl (1999).After spending a day sleeping off jet-lag in a seedy hotel in Karachi we flewnorth to the city of Multan, itself the shrine of a famous Islamic saint. Therewe found an English-speaking taxi-driver who was willing to drive us first northto Harappa, then south to Mohenjodaro, and finally to drop us off in Karachi-atotal journey of about 1000 kilometres.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_017_r1.jpg]MOHENJODAROI’ll pick up a bit of the story from my 1992 notebook, skipping over Harappasince, honestly, Mohenjodaro can stand for both places. At the point where theentry begins we’ve been on the road for most of the day and are just enteringthe province of Sind:Monday 16 November 1992Cross from Punjab into Sind quite late – 9.30 or 10 p.m. Checkpoints fairlythorough. Atmosphere of increased security in Sind. Finally arrive in Sukkur,crossing the Sukkur Barrage, around 10.50 p.m. and check into hotel in somedusty suburb around 11.50 p.m.Hotel receptionist, who also cooks us dinner around midnight, inquires what timewe will be leaving in the morning. I ask why he wants to know. He says becausethere is a big security problem in Sind – dacoits (bandits). Recently oneJapanese and one Taiwanese traveller were kidnapped on the road with a totalransom required of six million rupees – their families paid half; Pakistangovernment paid half. Foreigners very much in demand by kidnappers as all arebelieved to be enormously rich.It turns out we must have an escort to drive between Sukkur and Hyderabad viaMohenjodaro. Mohenjodaro itself, in Larkana district, is ‘very dangerous’apparently.It also turns out that a police guard will be required at the hotel all night,because we are there, to prevent us from being snatched from the room!Leave hotel at 9 a.m. next morning accompanied by four armed police escorts inthe back of a Toyota pick-up. They have an array of weapons – one G3, one AK47and two much older carbines.We follow and discover that we are part of a well-coordinated escort operationthat will see us ‘passed’, like the baton in a relay race, from police vehicleto police vehicle – a total of fourteen in all between Sukkur and Hyderabad.Often the escort cars drive very fast, headlights flashing, sirens sounding,pushing through traffic with us behind. In general we are treated like VIPs andthe police coordination is impressive with the next vehicle already pulling outahead of us as the previous vehicle pulls in at the end of its jurisdiction.They’re all in touch with each other by radio and the whole province of Sind, itseems, is under martial law, controlled by the army, with the police subordinateto the army.We arrive at Mohenjodaro around 11.30 complete with our police escort – at thispoint four guards in a lorry with two up front. En route we have broken downonce and spent an hour at the side of the road with the four armed policemenstanding in a cordon around us, presumably to prevent us from being snatched bythe twenty or so Sindhi villagers who milled curiously and unthreateninglyaround us in their little Sindhi hats.At any rate, we go straight into the site, still closely followed and guarded byour armed escorts, who politely refuse to leave us alone, even for a second,advising that there would be a real risk of our being snatched if they did. Wetherefore progress through the dusty ruins with an entourage of armed men. Itall feels slightly surreal and peculiar.Because the Harappan culture only very rarely decorated the bricks used in theconstruction of its massive buildings, Sir Mortimer Wheeler [The IndusCivilization, 3rd edition, 1968] describes the vast remnants of Mohenjodaro as‘impressive quantitatively and significant sociologically’ but ‘aestheticallymiles of monotony’.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn3] Surveying thevery extensive brick ruins through the heat-haze of midday, I found little todisagree with in Wheeler’s words. There is a certain monotony and sameness aboutthe acres of red brick under the red dust that lies everywhere. At the sametime, paradoxically, this strange place manages to be overwhelming: dense,solid, truly impenetrable.We approach the main area of ruins up some steep steps and around the westernedge of the eroded Buddhist stupa built here 2000 years ago [long after theIndus-Sarasvati civilization had ceased to exist]. From here there is a viewdown in a westerly direction over the structure that the archaeologists call the‘Great Bath’ and Mohenjodaro’s geometry of neat orderly streets organized into astrict north-south/east-west grid with rows of brick houses and covered drains.Beyond the Bath, again towards the west, what’s left of the ‘Granary’. Andbeyond that the old course of the Indus.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_018_r1.jpg]City plan of Mohenjodaro. Based on Possehl (1999).The Great Bath – presumed to have been for ritual bathing and purification –looks exactly like a medium-sized rectangular swimming pool and measures 11.89metres in length (north to south) and 7.01 metres wide (east to west), the depthbeing 2.44 metres.4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn4] Theclose-jointed brickwork and the use of bitumen damp-courses and gypsum mortar towaterproof it all bespeak a high culture with much experience of architecture –experience that could not have evolved overnight … Particularly impressive isthe drainage system, whereby water was released from the Great Bath, passingthrough a deep channel covered by a high brick corbel vault.Moving on from the Great Bath area we then walked half a mile or so to the eastof the stupa to the ‘DK’ residential area of probably wealthy or noble families.It’s called DK after its unfortunately named excavator, a certain D. K.Dikshitar, who worked here in the 1920s.DK would have been an imposing residential suburb. Many of its buildings hadtwo, sometimes even three, storeys and some walls still stand up to four metreshigh. Evidence that wooden beams, long since rotted away, once supportedfloorboards and ceilings. Also evidence of municipal street-lighting (lanternsin wall-sockets – one such lantern in museum) and municipal refuse collection –with public rubbish-bin enclosures. Even more impressive is the obvious concernwith sanitation evidenced by the miles of covered drains and by the fact thatmany of the houses had private toilets, somewhat of the modern Western type,which vented down carefully made angled brick slipways into the sewers or intorefuse pots that stood outside in the street under the vents and that arethought to have been cleared away at regular intervals by municipal sewagesquads. Inside the main sewage drains themselves, spaced at regular intervalsand again regularly cleaned out, were rectangular sump-pits that trapped solidwaste while allowing liquid waste to flow away.These people, in short, knew a great deal about urban life and urbanarchitecture. And that knowledge, I’m sure, was already old and evolved, handeddown, a legacy, when they first began to build Mohenjodaro …SCIENCEAt its peak in the mid-third millennium BC the total inhabited area ofMohenjodaro exceeded 250 hectares and it is possible that its population mayhave risen as high as 150,000.5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn5] Bythen it was part of a vast network of other cities, towns and villages withinthe Indus-Sarasvati civilization, the majority of them built out of baked mudbricks produced from moulds with standard proportions. One size of brick(measuring 7 × 14 × 28 centimetres) was used in house construction, and adifferent size (10 × 20 × 40 centimetres) was used in the building of citywalls. But both sizes of brick have identical proportions: thickness=1, width =2 × 1, length = 4 × 1.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn6]Like Mohenjodaro, some of the other Indus-Sarasvati settlements (though by nomeans all) were laid out according to a strict grid with the major thoroughfaresand buildings accurately aligned to the cardinal directions – north-south andeast-west. This suggests a high degree of planning and deliberation – after all,in most cultures settlements grow up haphazardly, a bit at a time, butapparently that didn’t happen here: in the case of many Indus-Sarasvati sitesthe template was set out right at the beginning. Moreover, the precision of thealignments of major structures leaves little doubt that the planners employedthe services of astronomers in their architectural teams. Several scholars havereasonably deduced that astronomy may have been a highly regarded science in theIndus-Sarasvati cities and was perhaps linked to whatever religion was practisedthere.7 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn7]It has also been noted that weights and measures found at Mohenjodaro, Harappaand many other widely separated Indus-Sarasvati sites are not only extremelyaccurate and consistent but demonstrate a high level of mathematicaldevelopment. The weights appear to have been designed according to a binaryscale: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., up to 12,800 units (with one unit beingequivalent to 0.85 grams).8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn8]Measures, on the other hand, made use of a decimal system: ‘In Mohenjodaro ascale was found that is divided into precise units of 0.264 inches. The “foot”measured 13.2 inches (equalling 50 × 0.264).’9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn9] Likewise in the Indus-Sarasvatiport of Lothal, S. R. Rao excavated a scale with tiny divisions of just over 1.7mm:Ten such divisions … (are equal to … 17.78 mm. The width of the wall of Lothaldock is 1.78 metres, which is a multiple of the smallest division of the Lothalscale marked in decimal ratio. The length of the east-west wall of the dock is20 times its width. Obviously the Harappan engineers followed the decimaldivision of measurement …10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn10]In Rao’s opinion the material remains of the Indus-Sarasvaticivilization-whether in terms of the alignments of its city blocks, the designand civil engineering of its efficient public sewerage systems, or the use ofstandardized weights and measures in precise mathematical relationships –provide ample proof of ‘the scientific approach of the Harappans’.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn11] In some cases this approach wasso scientific that ‘even today’, as Jonathan Kennoyer admits,many aspects of Indus technology are not fully understood as scholars attempt toreplicate stoneware ceramics from ordinary terracotta clay and to reproducebronze that was as hard as steel.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn12]‘ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WAS EVER WRITTEN ABOUT THIS CIVILIZATION BEFORE FIVEYEARS AGO IS WRONG …’It is inconceivable that a civilization as developed and well organized as theone that boomed 4500 years ago along the banks of the Indus and Sarasvati riversin northern India and Pakistan could have simply appeared from nowhere, fullyformed, with all its principal accomplishments already in place. Common sensesuggests that there must have been a very long developmental phase – somewhere –before such a civilization could have reached maturity. Yet for most of thetwentieth century the archaeological record refused to reveal evidence of asufficiently long period of development anywhere in the subcontinent.The result was a vacuum in which European scholars felt free to conclude thatthe Indus Valley civilization might, in its origins, have been alien to India.Many seem to have been attracted to this convenient explanation of the advancedstate of Indus-Sarasvati culture. For example, as S. P. Gupta points out, notonly did Sir Mortimer Wheeler teach that Mohenjodaro and Harappa had beendestroyed by invading Aryans; also he never quite brought himself to accept thatcities as advanced as these could originally have been the creation of Indiaherself and argued that at least ‘the “idea” of “city” as a way of life’ musthave come to India ‘from Mesopotamia’.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn13] He even tells us, Gupta noteswith annoyance,that at least some Mesopotamian masons must have been working in Mohenjodarodirecting the method of construction involved in brick masonry. All this simplymeans that at the operational level not only the ‘idea’ but also the ‘men’ camefrom Mesopotamia to India to give the latter her first cities.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn14]When Wheeler died in 1976 his theory of the Mesopotamian origin of the IndusValley civilization died with him. But the reason it did so had less to do withhis passing than with the start of excavations in 1974 by the Frencharchaeologist Jean-François Jarrige at a previously unexplored site namedMehrgarh overlooking the western edge of the Indus valley from the rugged Bolanpass.What Jarrige and his team have unearthed since then is the archaeologicalequivalent of the Holy Grail – an intact sequence of occupation layers atMehrgarh extending uninterrupted from approximately 6800 BC, 4000 years beforethe urban boom at Harappa and Mohenjodaro, until the decline of these cities inthe second millennium BC.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn15] Theexcavations are still actively underway and the pace of analysis at Mehrgarh,and other nearby sites such as Nausharo that are equally ancient, has quickenedsince the mid-1990s with results that have a dramatic bearing on the origins ofthe Indus-Sarasvati civilization. Indeed, these results are so dramatic thatwhen we spoke with Gregory Possehl by telephone in October 2000 he had this tosay: ‘You want to know something? I’m teaching a class and I told them thatalmost everything that was ever written about this civilization before fiveyears ago is wrong.’16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn16]In chapter 8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08] we will return to themystery of Mehrgarh, but in 1992, when Santha and I visited Harappa andMohenjodaro, I was ignorant of the place and knew nothing of its extraordinaryimplications.FROM THE HIMALAYAS TO THE SEAAfter leaving Pakistan on 19 November 1992 we travelled first to Nepal, wherethe bookshops in the narrow streets of Kathmandu’s cosmopolitan Thamel marketare stocked with interesting and unusual reference works on ancient Indianreligious thought – including many of the hard-to-find primary texts. AtPilgrims Bookshop I was able to buy the entire unabridged six-volume set ofRalph Griffith’s 1881 translations of the Rig Veda, the Atharva Veda, the YajurVeda and the Sama Veda. But, because at that point I had no reason to disagreewith the 1200–800 BC time-span that scholars assigned to the Vedas, I again andagain postponed studying these huge, daunting books over the next several yearsand gave my attention instead to texts from Sumer and Old Kingdom Egypt, which Isupposed to be much more ancient.I was about to learn in due course that a new generation of scholars both fromwithin and beyond India are beginning to be convinced that the opposite may betrue and that the Vedic hymns could be, by a margin of several thousand years,the most ancient surviving scriptures on earth. In 1992, however, this was justanother one of the many possibilities about India’s mysterious past that I wasignorant of.From Nepal we flew on to northern and eastern India – Delhi, Khajuraho, Puri,Konarak – and then south to Tamil Nadu:Sunday 6 December 1992Arrive Madras around 10 a.m. – with a migraine. Dr Ramni Pulimood, who workedwith my father in the 50s at the Christian Medical College, has sent a taxi topick us up. We motor the 150 kms to Vellore, passing the spot where Rajiv Gandhiwas assassinated. There is a small memorial to him which we visit.I’m in a coma with my migraine for most of the journey, but rouse myself when weare about 50 kms outside Vellore. Is the countryside familiar? I don’t knowreally. Don’t seem to recognize anything. Then we cross a bridge over a verywide dried-out river bed – and I’m sure I remember that from my dreams ofchildhood, just as I’m sure I remember a dried-out river bed suddenly filled tooverflowing with the roiling, rearing waters of a flash flood. And I remember,too, palm trees bent double in the monsoons, the warm splash of fat drops ofrain on my bare back, red spider-mites teeming across the earth, and the smellof distant thunder.We reach Vellore – a medium-sized, dirty, bustling south Indian town full ofgarish modern signs and vegetarian restaurants. I still remember very little,even when we pull up for a moment right outside the CMC Hospital.Then we drive through the town and out again towards the CMC compound. I do seemto remember an old school that we pass. Finally I see to my left College Hillrising greenly to a rocky summit and, far away to my right, Toad Hill – so namedafter the toad-shaped boulder that squats on its peak. I do remember both ofthese landmarks quite vividly, and remember climbing them as a child with my dadand our dog Trixie, but the college buildings into which we now pull ring noimmediate bells. I realize later that this is so because they now stand toeither side of a busy main road. In the 50s there was no road like this.We go to ‘the big bungalow’ and meet Ramni Pulimood, who accommodates us thereas previously agreed. Inside, I remember the ancient green cloth blinds whichwere also standard fitments in the Men’s Hostel where we lived and in which Ionce found a trapped bat.Half an hour later Ramni and her son drive us out to the Protestant cemetery,where we hope to find my sister Susan’s grave. Santha brings flowers, butdespite pacing up and down in the peaceful late-afternoon sun we find nothing.We ask the caretakers to check the records, but they too fail to find the grave.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_019_r1.jpg]1.

We visit the CMC Hospital in themorning. Then take a rickshaw to Vellore Fort and then back to the CMC compoundvia the Protestant cemetery once again. Still we can’t find the grave. It’sstrange to reflect that my sister lies buried and forgotten somewhere here. Idreamed of her a few nights ago, dreamed that she spoke to me. I would like tohave known her and-really for the first time – am acutely aware of a missingpresence in my life. It’s all years ago now, and far away, but I do miss you,Susan. I wish I could just pick up the phone and call you sometimes. Instead I’man only child, wandering in a graveyard, feeling sorry for myself.Santha and I complete our visit to Vellore by exploring the CMC compound. Iremember the lily-pond – still there – with its frogs. And I do remember thegreat old tamarind tree and the general outline of the two wings of the Men’sHostel.Finally we climb up College Hill again for a last look around and then set offon the four-hour drive to Madras on the coast of the Bay of Bengal.THE MYSTERY OF THE SEVEN PAGODASThe next day our target was Mahabalipuram, 50 kilometres south of Madras, whereI planned to indulge some more childhood memories – this time of a rock-hewntemple standing by the sea. As in Vellore, I didn’t really feel that I was thereto do research, more on a journey of personal reminiscence. Since the templeswere thought to be less than 1500 years old, and had been made on the orders ofknown historical kings, I had no reason to expect they might be relevant to myprimary interest in the possibility of a lost civilization of the last Ice Agemore than 12,000 years ago.Perhaps it was because I went to Mahabalipuram in this frame of mind in 1992that it gave me back exactly what I expected – i.e. nothing of interest. And yetall along, as I was to discover much later, there was something that I needed toknow there. It was hidden away in an anthology of travellers’ journals andreports edited by a certain Captain M. W. Carr in 1869 under the titleDescriptive and Historical Papers Relating to the Seven Pagodas of theCoromandel Coast.17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn17] I found theanthology in a second-hand bookshop in Madras after visiting Mahabalipuram in1992 but did not read it until the year 2000. It was then I discovered for thefirst time that ‘Seven Pagodas’ is the old mariners’ name for Mahabalipuram –and that the Coromandel coast is the coast of the Bay of Bengal from PointCalimere in the south to the mouth of the Krishna river in the north.In one paper J. Goldingham, Esq., writing in 1798, spoke of the part ofMahabalipuram that I remembered best from my childhood – the ‘Shore Temple’,carved out of solid granite, lashed by waves:The surf here breaks far out over, as the Brahmins inform you, the ruins of acity which was incredibly large and magnificent … A Brahmin, about 50 years ofage, a native of the place, whom I have had an opportunity of conversing withsince my arrival in Madras, informed me his grandfather had frequently mentionedhaving seen the gilt tops of five pagodas in the surf, no longer visible.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn18]An earlier traveller’s report, from 1784, describes the main feature ofMahabalipuram as a ‘rock, or rather hill of stone’, out of which many of themonuments are carved. This outcropping, he says:is one of the principal marks for mariners as they approach the coast and tothem the place is known by the name of ‘Seven Pagodas’, possibly because thesummits of the rock have presented them with that idea as they passed: but itmust be confessed that no aspect which the hill assumes seems at all toauthorize this notion; and there are circumstances that would lead one tosuspect that this name has arisen from some such number of Pagodas that formerlystood here and in time have been buried in the waves …19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn19]The same author, William Chambers, then goes on to relate the more detailed oraltradition of Mahabalipuram – given to him by Brahmins of the town during visitsthat he made there in 1772 and 177620[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn20] – that prompted his suspicion ofsubmerged structures.According to this tradition, which is supported by certain passages in ancientHindu scriptures,21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn21] the godVishnu had deposed a corrupt and wicked Raja of these parts at some unknown datein the remote past and had replaced him on the throne with the gentle Prahlada,whose reign ‘was a mild and virtuous one’.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn22] Prahlada was succeeded by his sonand then by his grandson Bali, said to have been the founder of the oncemagnificent city of Mahabalipuram (which, translated literally, means ‘the cityof the great Bali’ or more likely ‘the city of the giant Bali’).23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn23] Bali’s dynasty continued with hisson Banasura – also portrayed as a giant24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn24] but during his reign disasterstruck:Aniruddha, the [grand]son of Krishna, came to his [Banasura’s] court in disguiseand seduced his daughter, which produced a war in the course of which Aniruddhawas taken prisoner and brought to Mahabalipuram; upon which Krishna came inperson from his capital Dwarka and laid siege to the place.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn25]Although the god Siva himself fought on the side of Banasura, they could notprevail. Krishna found a way to overthrow Siva, captured the city and forcedBanasura into submission and lifelong fealty.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn26]An interval followed, after which another Raja – whose name was Malecheren –took the throne at Mahabalipuram. He encountered a being from the heavenlyrealms who became his friend and agreed ‘to carry him in disguise to see thecourt of the divine Indra’ – a favour that had never before been granted to anymortal:27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn27]The Raja returned from thence with new ideas of splendour and magnificence,which he immediately adopted in regulating his court and his retinue, and inbeautifying his seat of government. By this means Mahabalipuram became sooncelebrated beyond all the cities of the earth; and an account of itsmagnificence having been brought to the gods assembled at the court of Indra,their jealousy was so much excited at it that they sent orders to the God of theSea to let loose his billows and overflow a place which impiously pretended tovie in splendour with their celestial mansions. This command he obeyed, and thecity was at once overflowed by that furious element, nor has it ever since beenable to rear its head.28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn28]There are puzzles about this myth.First, it was collected, written down and published in the eighteenth century.This was long before any of the ancient inscriptions of Mesopotamia could beread, yet the story of Mahabalipuram bears some striking resemblances to theflood myths of Mesopotamia. In the original Sumerian flood text cited in chapter2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02], and in all later variants of it –including the Babylonian versions, the Old Testament account of the flood ofNoah and, for that matter, Plato’s (supposedly unrelated) story of Atlantis29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn29] – the gods are angry with orjealous of mankind, exactly as they are said to have been in the Mahabalipurammyth. In all the other myths (with the exception of the Noah story) the godsmeet in assembly – again as they are said to have done at Mahabalipuram – beforeresolving to destroy upstart mankind by sending a flood. And in all the othermyths cities and cult centres are submerged by the flood:Sumer: ‘All the windstorms, exceedingly powerful, attacked as one; at the sametime the flood swept over the cult centres.’Mahabalipuram: ‘The God of the Sea … let loose his billows and … the city was atonce overflowed by that furious element …’It is also obvious that there are resonances between the Mahabalipuram floodtradition from south-eastern India and the Dwarka flood tradition from thenorth-west. It is not just that Dwarka is specifically mentioned in theMahabalipuram story (somewhat surprising in itself) but also that Mahabalipuramand Dwarka, like lost Atlantis and the five antediluvian cities of Sumer, allsuffer the same fate – which is to be swallowed up by the sea.In the case of Dwarka there is also another matter to consider – the end of theformer age of the earth and the dawn of the Kali Yuga.TRAVELS IN THE KALI YUGAOur journey from Mahabalipuram to Dwarka in December 1992 was fraught withreminders that we live in the Kali Yuga today – an age of spiritual darknessthat the Vedic sages always knew would be filled with the worst kinds of humancruelty and evil. On 6 December 1992 Hindu kar savaks (volunteers) violentlyattacked and pulled down the mosque at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh intent onbuilding a new temple for Ram (Rama, another incarnation of Vishnu), whosebirthplace is believed to have been on the site of the mosque. This act of‘reclamation’ sparked off a wave of violence and mass murder between Hindus andMuslims throughout India which reached a peak in the city of Surat on the Gulfof Cambay in south-western Gujerat. There whole families were roasted alive onfires made up of heaps of their own possessions and in one grisly incident awoman was subjected to multiple rape by a crowd of frenzied males, then burned,and finally beheaded with a sword.With martial law declared in most cities and go-slows and strikes being stagedby Indian Airlines, it took us two days to fly via Madras and Trivandrum toBombay. From there we arranged to travel the remaining 1000 kilometres or so toDwarka by road and hired a Maruti van (a motorized roller-skate) and a stalwartGujerati driver named Vinhod to get us there.Saturday 12 December 1992Set off north from Bombay in our little Maruti van. The country towards Gujeratis surprisingly lush, jungly and hilly. The roads are completely crazy and thisis an interminable day of driving. It becomes clear that we cannot reach Dwarkain less than two full days like this, and that we may require three – so we setour sights for the first night on Lothal, the Indus-Sarasvati port of the thirdmillennium BC that lies in central Gujerat near the northern end of the Gulf ofCambay. Unfortunately, Vinhod and most people along the way don’t seem to knowwhere or what Lothal is and the maps we have are not clear. But part by luck,part by trial and error, we arrive at a truck stop called Pakota late, late atnight which turns out to be just 18 kms from Lothal. One of the truckers directsus to a rundown hotel.LOTHAL AND THE SHIPS FROM MELUHALothal turned out to be a quiet sleepy mound in the midst of flat, productivecountryside, but in the third millennium BC it was the greatest port of theIndus Valley civilization, connected to the sea by a tidal river channel thathas long since dried up. Its dominant architectural feature still survivingtoday is its great trapezoidal dock.A major problem with river ports in general is that they can quickly becomechoked by silt and useless. At Lothal a scientific solution was found to thisproblem 4500 years ago. First a huge artificial basin was cut into the ground onthe eastern side of the town. Then a walled structure measuring 219 metres inlength (north-south), 38 metres in width (east-west) and 4.15 metres high, wasbuilt into it. The walls were almost 1.78 metres thick at the base, narrowing tojust over 1 metre thick at the top, and millions of the best quality kiln-firedbricks were used in their construction.30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn30] According to the report of S. R.Rao, Lothal’s excavator, the inner faces of the dock walls are plumb and ‘nosteps or ramps are provided anywhere as the primary purpose was to see that theedge of the boat should touch the wall-top to facilitate easy landing andhandling of cargo’.31 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn31] At the sametime ‘three offsets were provided on the outer face of the western wall and twoin the case of other walls to resist the overturning movement due to waterthrust’.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn32]The dock has a major inlet in its north wall, a second inlet at the southern endof its east wall and a spillway, fitted with an efficient water-locking device,in its south:33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn33]Ships entering the Gulf of Cambay had to be moored along the river quay on thewestern side of the town and sluiced into the basin at high tide through thefirst inlet (12 metres wide) provided in the northern arm. A spillway with 1.5metre thick walls was built at right angles to the southern arm for escape ofexcess water at high tide. The water-locking device provided in the spillwayensured a minimum draught at low water [2 metres as against 3.5 metres at highwater]. Easy manoeuvrability of large ships of 60 to 75 tons capacity andmeasuring 18 to 20 metres long was possible as they could enter from the shorterside and move along the longer side. The easy flow of water at high tide throughthe basin ensured automatic desilting. The scouring effect of the tidal waterswas arrested by constructing a buttress wall on either margin of the inlet,traces of which can be seen in the case of the northern inlet and more clearlyin the second-stage inlet. When the river changed its course and started flowing2 kms away from the town, a new inlet 2 metres deep, was dug to connect theriver with the eastern arm of the dock, but large ships could not enter thebasin after 2000 BC.34 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn34]Archaeologists and engineers are in little doubt that the design of the docktestifies to a long-accumulated experience within the Indus-Sarasvaticivilization of the particular problems and challenges posed by such structures.According to N. K. Panikkar and T. M. Srinivasan:The Lothal dock being purely a tidal one, the Lothal engineers must havepossessed adequate knowledge of tidal effects, the amplitude, erosion andthrust. From this knowledge they developed competence at Lothal for receivingships at high tide and ensuring flotation of ships inside the dock at low tide.This is perhaps the earliest example of knowledge of tidal phenomena being putto a highly practical purpose both in the selection of site having the highesttidal amplitude and in adopting a method of operation for entry and exit ofships.35 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn35]The builders of Lothal lived in the same epoch of early history as the buildersof the wonderful Great Pyramid of Egypt and – though obviously on a smallerscale – the dock is a reminder that the peoples of the Indus-Sarasvaticivilization possessed a scientific approach, design skills, and hands-onexperience of construction problems comparable to those that were evidentamongst the ancient Egyptians.Moreover, it is thought likely that there were both direct and indirect contactsbetween the Nile and Indus valleys, and between Asia and Africa in general,going back to very ancient times. In the on-site museum at Lothal we were ableto see certain items excavated by Rao’s team that are indicative of this. Theseinclude a terracotta figurine of a gorilla, a species that is found only insub-Saharan Africa, and a second terracotta figure reminiscent of an Egyptianmummy.36 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn36]Finds in Egypt also suggest contact. Of special interest, because it dates backto the predynastic ‘Gerzean’ period (roughly 3500–3300 BC),37[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn37] is a ripple-flaked flint-bladedknife with a beautifully carved ivory handle that was excavated at Gebel-el-Arakin Upper Egypt. In one of the reliefs that decorate the handle a bearded man infine robes is depicted gripping two powerful male lions by the throat. Accordingto the Egyptologist and art historian Cyril Aldred, this scene ‘shows, subduingtwo lions, a hero who resembles the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh, “Lord of theBeasts”’.38 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn38] Aldred notes that‘this same unusual theme appears on a wall-painting in a Gerzean tomb atHierakonopolis’39 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn39] – which isindeed the case. He seems unaware, however, that, with minor variations, thescene also appears in the art of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization – for example,on ornate terracotta and steatite seals, excavated in many sites, and on aparticularly striking moulded tablet from Harappa that Jonathan Mark Kennoyerdescribes as:a figure strangling two tigers with bare hands [which] may represent a female,as a pronounced breast can be seen in profile. Early discoveries of this motifon seals from Mohenjodaro definitely show a male figure, and most scholars haveassumed some connection with the carved seals from Mesopotamia that illustrateepisodes from the famous Gilgamesh epic. The Mesopotamian motifs show lionsbeing strangled by a hero, whereas the Indus narratives render tigers beingstrangled by a figure, sometimes clearly male, sometimes ambiguous or possiblyfemale. This motif of a hero or heroine grappling with two wild animals couldhave been created independently for similar events that may have occurred inMesopotamia as well as the Indus Valley.40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn40][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_033_r1.jpg]Gilgamesh-like figure between two felines from a bronze breastplate, Tiahuanaco.Perhaps. But I wonder if Kennoyer’s conclusion is not a little hasty, andwhether it is strengthened or weakened by the fact that almost identical figuresof a ‘man between two felines’ have also been found amongst the art of theprehistoric megalithic city of Tiahuanaco in South America.41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn41] Such similarities may depictsimilar events that occurred by coincidence in different places, but otherexplanations might also fruitfully be sought for why the same – ‘unusual’ –symbolic device is found in ancient Egypt, ancient Mesopotamia, the ancientIndus-Sarasvati civilization and ancient South America.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_034_r1.jpg]Gilgamesh-like figure between two felines from a Gerzean period knife, Egypt.On the other side of the Gebel-el-Arak knife handle is a second scene thatsuggests contact between Indus-Sarasvati peoples, predynastic Egyptians and theancient civilizations between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers inMesopotamia. In Aldred’s description it shows a water battle in progress: ‘Inthe upper row, the boats have vertical prows and sterns rather like the belemsof the Tigris, in the lower they have the normal appearance of Egyptian boats ofGerzean date.’42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn42] But thearchaeologist Ernest J. H. Mackay, who carried out extensive excavations in bothEgypt and the Indus valley during the first half of the twentieth century,noticed something else. Describing a representation of a boat carved on a sealthat he found at Mohenjodaro, he commented:The bindings of its hull suggest that this boat was made of bundles of reeds, aswere so many contemporary craft of ancient Egypt. It is mastless, which perhapsindicates that it is a river boat. The uprights at either end of the cabin carryflags or emblems and a seated steersman holds a pair of rudders, as on themodern Indus craft. This vessel, it is interesting to note, is singularly theone portrayed on the well known Gebel-el-Arak ivory knife handle.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn43]The specific comparison being made here is to the mastless boats with high prowsand sterns, which Aldred separately likens to Tigris river craft, and while thesimilarities cannot be taken as conclusive evidence of contact amongst all threeregions in prehistory they are at least suggestive. Thor Heyerdahl showed longago with his Tigris and Ra expeditions that reed-boats are capable oftrans-oceanic journeys.44 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn44] Besidesmany representations and terracotta models of masted sea-going boats have beenfound in Indus-Sarasvati sites – and at Lothal itself trade goods and inscribedseals from the Persian Gulf have been excavated.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn45]The indications are that the bulk of this trade was carried on ships of theIndus-Sarasvati civilization – a civilization that was known to its neighboursin the Persian Gulf as Meluha.46 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn46]Inscriptions from ancient Babylon and Akkad speak proudly of the number of greatboats from Meluha that have moored in their harbours. Five such references havebeen found in the cuneiform records of the time before Hammurabi (1792 BC).47[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn47] One concerns Sargon of Akkad(2334–2279 BC) and tells us: ‘the ships from Meluha … he made tie up alongsidethe quay of Akkad’.48 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn48]Interestingly, a terracotta seal from Mohenjodaro shows a large high-prowed shipwith a spacious on-deck cabin. Fore and aft of the cabin perch two birds whicharchaeologists believe are ‘land-finding birds [diskakas]’.49[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn49] As the reader will undoubtedly beaware, many ancient traditions of the global flood, not least the biblical storyof Noah, make prominent mention of the role played in the navigation of thesurvival ship by birds just such as these.50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn50]THE CITY OF KRISHNAAfter leaving Lothal in the late afternoon we spent another night on the road atJamnagar, the regional capital, and completed our journey to Dwarka the nextmorning. This final two-hour leg was across the barren, sun-baked flatlands ofGujerat’s Kathiawar peninsula, uninhabited and for the most part overgrown withthorn trees and scrub vegetation. Through the open windows of the van we beganto sense first the humidity, then the salty tang, of the approaching ArabianSea. Next, a glimpse of distant water came into view and, rising above itthrough the heat haze, a shimmering pyramidal mound, topped by the spectacularDwarkadish temple, sacred to Lord Krishna, soaring skywards on its 72 granitecolumns.51 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn51] At the apex of themirage fluttered a colourful flag decorated with astronomical symbols, whilearound its base the medieval labyrinth of Dwarka’s streets and houses clusteredtightly packed, as though seeking protection.We asked Vinhod to bring us closer and we eventually pulled up in a crowdedmarket area directly in front of the temple. From this vantage point I couldmake out weird figures like the gargoyles of a Gothic cathedral carved into thecorners of the roof and walls – here an elephant, there a swan, there a wingedsphinx with a woman’s face … It was easy to imagine the temple as an avatar’spalace magically brought into being in the midst of the sea, charged with themantric energy of pilgrims’ prayers and surrounded by a force-field of divinegrace.In Book X of the Bhagvata Purana we read how Krishna used ‘his supernaturalyogic powers’,52 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn52] in a crisis ofbattle, to transfer all his people to Dwarka where he could protect them fromthe enemy in ‘a fortress inaccessible to human beings’ [literally ‘bipeds’]:the Lord caused a fortress constructed in the western sea. In the fortress hegot built a city twelve yojanas (96 miles) in area and wonderful in everyrespect.The building of the city exhibited the expertise in architecture and the skillin masonry of Tvastr, the architect of the gods. The roads, quadrangles, streetsand residential areas were constructed in conformity to the prescribed tenets ofthe science of architecture pertaining to city building.In that city, gardens planted with celestial trees and creepers and wonderfulparks were laid out. It was built with sky-scraping, gold-towered buildings andbalconies of crystals. It had barns built of silver and brass which were adornedwith gold pitchers. The houses therein were of gold and big emeralds.53[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn53]But that was the first Dwarka, the original Dwarka – India’s lost Atlantisswallowed up by the sea long ago at the beginning of the Kali Age. This Dwarkaof today, whatever it was, and this Krishna temple, were much more recent-builtto commemorate the inundated city perhaps, but not to be confused with it.Santha and I checked into a mosquito-infested hotel with the bonus of severaldozen hornets drowsing irritably in the curtains of our room and then took astroll through the town in the late afternoon. It was dusty, of course, dirty,of course. There were people, everywhere, of both sexes and all age-groups –selling to one another, buying from one another. Nobody seemed to be miserableor angry or in a grouchy mood. A whole menagerie of animals roamed the streets,grunting and squawking, barking and mewing, bleating and mooing. There were cowseverywhere – a normal sight in Hindu India but here the sacred animals seemed tobe more than usually serene and unhurried. I suppose it helps that just abouteverybody in Gujerat, and definitely everybody in Dwarka, is a strict vegetarian– so strict that not only are animals safe from them but also eggs, onions andgarlic as well.Through the maze of narrow lanes and cobbled alleyways lined with tiny, garishone-roomed shops and makeshift stalls we worked our way down to the bank of theGomati river where it runs along the edge of the town and enters the ArabianSea. Here, a large group of giggling children fed breadcrumbs to small fish, andorange-robed sadhus, their faces smeared with ash, sat with their backs to anancient brick wall, reciting verses from the Rig Veda. The air was filled withfrankincense and ganja and the sound of chanting, and the December sun, settingout over the sea to the south-west, had infused the vast horizon with anotherworldly glow.Continuing the remaining few hundred metres along the embankment in thegathering dusk we came to the small circular temple of Samudranarayana – thetemple of Samudra, God of the Ocean – perched directly above the point where theGomati flows into the sea. A breeze was picking up, stirring the waves intowhite caps, and I walked to the edge of the jetty and looked out.I had read the reports of the marine archaeologists and I knew that a city ofgigantic proportions lay underwater less than a kilometre in front of me. Ireminded myself that a conjectural date of approximately 1700–1500 BC had beenassigned to the site by S. R. Rao and that he believed it to be one of the lateworks of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization – much too late to have had anythingto do with any hypothetical lost civilization of the last Ice Age.But there were areas of doubt. Although it seemed astonishing, and was perhapsjust the result of incomplete research on my part, I had not been able to findevidence in the scientific literature that any Indus-Sarasvati artefacts-thoughreasonably plentiful in the countryside round about – had ever been recoveredfrom the submerged ruins of Dwarka (or, for that matter, evidence that anydatable objects of any kind had ever been found there). All that thearchaeologists had discovered underwater were the looming remains of huge stonewalls built of undatable megalithic blocks often interlocked with one another bymeans of L-shaped dovetails. Since there were thick silt deposits around thesite, it was possible that many further structures remained as yet unexcavatedbeneath those that had already been mapped. Moreover, no thorough survey hadbeen done further out from the shore in water that was deeper than 20 metres.All in all it seemed to me that the chronology that the archaeologists hadproposed here might be right or might be wrong, but was far from settled. Andwhat complicated the picture even more was the opaque history of relativesea-level rise in this part of India which had included several intense episodesof tectonic activity to do with mountain-building in the Himalayas during thepast 20,000 years. It had therefore proved difficult to establish the date ofDwarka’s submergence from geological clues alone.The sun was now half-sunk in the ocean and the light was fading fast as thewaves piled up against the jetty.It would be another four years before I learned to dive and four more after thatbefore I could return to Dwarka to explore the underwater city."},{"pageContent":"6 / THE PLACE OF THE SHIP’S DESCENTSages who searched with their heart’s thought discovered the existent’s kinshipin the non-existent … Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence itwas born and whence comes this creation?

Having just read the statement, and knowing the authority of its sourceare you: Shocked? Surprised (that you have not seen any headlines on this)?Sceptical? Disbelieving? Disoriented (if the Jews didn’t write the OldTestament, then who did)? Angry? All of the above? None of the above? Or do youknow enough about the Torah and about Jewish culture to have realized at oncethat the statement is a complete fabrication? No such scientific evidence hasever been produced and the identification of the Torah with the Jewish peopleand the Hebrew language remains unassailable today. This is so because thesacred book is comprehensively rooted and grounded in a known culturalbackground of great antiquity and fits perfectly into its historical andarchaeological context.The same cannot be said of the Rig Veda, the fundamental scripture of Hinduism.The abandonment by scholars of the theory that India was invaded around 1500 BCby a people calling themselves the Aryas, and the recognition that there neverwas any such thing as an Aryan race that spoke Indo-European languages, have hadthe unfortunate side-effect of orphaning the Rig – because it was hithertobelieved that these very same Aryas had been its authors. We’ve also seen how ithas been claimed by Renfrew and others – probably correctly-that Indo-Europeanlanguages have been present in north India for at least 8000 years. Logically,therefore, the fact that the Rig Veda is expressed in Sanskrit-an Indo-Europeanlanguage – can no longer be used to substantiate a chronology for the Rig Vedathat brings the culture that is supposed to have composed it into India (via thenon-existent Aryan ‘invasion’) as late as 1500 BC.In other words, the ship of the Vedas presently has no one at the helm. Thesesublime hymns, these cleverly coded riddles from antiquity, which form the corescripture of a thousand million Hindus in the twenty-first century, now stand inthe astonishing position of having no known authors, no known culturalbackground and no known historical or archaeological context into which theyfit. Moreover, although their moorings to an ‘Aryan’ race in 1500 BC have beensevered, most orthodox historians and archaeologists living outside the Indiansubcontinent seem content to leave the Vedas drifting and unassigned – thescriptures of no known people composed at no known time.In such a situation where history has little to offer and a huge blunder toretract, it becomes reasonable to inquire: what do the Vedas have to say on thesubject of their own origins?SOME POINTS OF TERMINOLOGY, SOME BASIC INFORMATIONIn ancient Sanskrit the word veda means ‘knowledge’, ‘gnosis’, ‘insight’(deriving from the root vid, meaning ‘to see, to know’),1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn1] and the word rig [rc or rik) means‘verses’ or ‘hymns’.2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn2] So Rig Vedameans ‘Verses’ or ‘Hymns’ of ‘Knowledge’. We’ve seen that there are three otherVedas. These are, respectively, the Sama Veda – the Veda of song or chanted hymn(a reordering for liturgical purposes of certain verses of the Rig with newverses added);3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn3] the Yajur Veda –an annotated text of the instructions and sacrificial formulae required at Vedicrituals;4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn4] and the Atharva Veda,which Gregory Possehl describes as the ‘least understood of the Vedas … a bookof magic, spells and incantations in verse’5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn5] and Griffith as ‘the Veda ofPrayers, Charms and Spells’.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn6]As well as these, many Indian scholars also list the following massive andvenerable bodies of text within the Vedic corpus:7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn7] the Brahmanas (very ancient prosecommentaries on the Vedas),8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn8] theArankyas (a later development of the Brahmanas, given over to ‘secretexplanations of the allegorical meaning of the Vedas’)9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn9] and the Upanishads (philosophicalspeculations arising out of the Vedas).10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn10]The Upanishads are often referred to in Sanskrit as the Vedanta, meaning‘conclusion of the Veda’, since they are thought to represent the final stage inthe tradition of the Vedas.11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn11]However, there are other important later texts of Hinduism which unerringlycontinue the same essential teaching and cosmology rooted and grounded in theVedas, and which will therefore also be cited in this inquiry from time to time.These include the Mahabaratha (which is about eight times as long as Homer’sOdyssey and Iliad put together!),12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn12] the Ramayana, and the Puranas.The Mahabaratha and the Ramayana are both epics consisting of a mass oflegendary and instructive material worked around a central heroic narrative.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn13] Embedded within the vast text ofthe Mahabaratha is the famous Bhagvad Gita, (‘Song of the Lord’), described as‘the single most important text of Hinduism’.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn14] The Ramayana, which tells of thedeeds of the hero Rama, an incarnation of Krishna, is traditionally ascribed tothe semi-legendary poet Valmiki.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn15] Last but not least, the Puranas(Sanskrit for ‘Ancient Lore’) are collections of myth, legend and genealogy.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn16]A generally agreed chronology for all these texts (with arguments usually aboutperiods of hundreds rather than thousands of years) is in use amongst scholars.We saw earlier that the Rig Veda tends to be dated anywhere in a broad rangefrom 1500 BC (the supposed date of the non-existent Aryan invasion of India)down to 800 BC. Dr John E. Mitchiner, a great authority on the ancient Sanskrittexts, prefers a narrower range of 1400–1100 BC for the Rig, with the Sama andYajur Vedas dated 1200-1000 BC, the Atharva Veda 1300–900 BC, the Brahmanas900–600 BC, the Aranyakas 700–500 BC, the Upanishads 600–400 BC, the Mahabaratha350 BC – AD350, the Ramayana 250BC - AD200, and the Puranas AD200-1500.17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn17]While this is convenient as a summary of what is still, amazingly, the acceptedscholarly chronology, I feel it is essential to bear in mind that these datesare a house of cards founded on the redundant hypothesis of an Aryan invasion ofIndia in the second millennium BC. Whether starting in 1500 BC, 1400 BC or 1200BC, the timelines that have been suggested for the compilation and codificationof the Rig Veda all rest on this now thoroughly falsified and bankrupt idea. Andsince the chronology that scholars have ‘established’ for the Rig is thefoundation of the entire literary history of India, it follows that if thepreviously accepted dates for it are proved by further research to be badly inerror then the dates for much of what comes after it are also likely to bewrong. In this connection, Mitchiner himself concedes that ‘the dating ofSanskrit texts is a notoriously difficult problem’18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn18] – one that is further complicatedby many texts ‘which may be relatively late in their overall or finalcomposition yet contain passages of considerable antiquity alongside much lateradditions’.19 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn19]Amidst this tangled maze of texts, all of which once lived as memorizedrecitations within an oral tradition before they were written down, only onestory is offered – the same story repeated again and again with minor variationsand additions – as an explanation and account of the origins of the Vedas. Thisis the story of Manu, the father of mankind – India’s Noah – and of a mysteriousbrotherhood of ascetics called the ‘Seven Sages’, said in many of the recensionsto have accompanied Manu in the Ark when the great flood overtook the world.THE FATHER OF MANKINDManu (whose name has the same root as the English word man) was the first andgreatest patriarch and legislator of the Vedic peoples and is unambiguouslydescribed throughout the ancient texts as the preserver and father of mankindand of all living things.20 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn20] RalphGriffith, the translator of the Vedas, describes him as ‘the representative manand father of the human race and the first institutor of religiousceremonies’.21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn21] And in the RigVeda the people who called themselves the ‘Aryas’ – an epithet meaning literallythe ‘noble’, or ‘pure’, or ‘good’ or ‘enlightened’ folk (a puzzle that we shallreturn to in another chapter) – are also referred to as ‘Manu’s progeny’,22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn22] while Manu is known as ‘FatherManu’23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn23] and even the gods arenamed as ‘Manu’s Holy Ones’.24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn24] Atthe same time the Rig does not take the trouble, anywhere, to tell us exactlywhat it was that Manu supposedly did to earn these honorifics; only that theevents took place ‘long ago’.25 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn25]Manu’s literary predicament much resembles that of Osiris in ancient Egypt.Nowhere in the entire corpus of ancient Egyptian scripture, from the PyramidTexts to the last versions of the Book of the Dead, is the full story of Osirisever told. We get fragments of it, bits and pieces here and there, records ofhis titles and honorifics, many axioms (‘the truth is great and mighty and ithas never been broken since the time of Osiris’, etc. but never a connected,continuous narrative which states clearly what it was that Osiris did to deserveall this honour and prominence. Only in a later, non-Egyptian, text – Plutarch’sIsis and Osiris – does the whole story come out. Plutarch states that hissources were Egyptian priests and the details that he provides are soconvincingly identical to the much more fragmentary details contained in themuch earlier ancient Egyptian material that each, in a way, providescorroboration for the other. Scholars therefore believe that Plutarch got thestory just about right and that it was never spelled out in detail in theearlier scriptures because it was simply too well known for this to benecessary.26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn26]It looks as though the same sort of process must have been at work within theRig Veda. Here, like Osiris for the Egyptians, Manu is a household name evenincorporated into aphorisms such as ‘may we speak like Manu’27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn27] – which, Griffith says, wasuniversally understood to mean ‘with the wisdom and authority of Manu who wasinstructed directly by the Gods’.28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn28] Yet nowhere in the Rig is thereanything even remotely resembling a continuous Manu narrative which wouldexplain the awe within which he was held and the fundamental role assigned tohim as the saviour and the progenitor of Vedic civilization. As with the case ofOsiris in Egypt, it is probably safe to assume the full story of Manu was simplyso well known amongst the practitioners of the Vedas that the composers andcompilers saw no need to spell it out in detail.A FLOOD TO CARRY AWAY ALL CREATURESThe earliest surviving glimpse of a more complete version of the story of Manuis provided by the Satpatha Brahmana. The setting is antediluvian India someyears before it is to be destroyed by the flood and Manu is a king and leader ofmen (specifically identified in the later Bhagvata Purana with ‘a South Indianor Dravidian king named Satyavrata’):29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn29]In the morning they brought to Manu water for washing the hands. When he waswashing himself a fish came into his hands. It spake to him the word ‘Rear me, Iwill save thee!’ ‘Wherefrom wilt thou save me?’ ‘A flood will carry away thesecreatures: from that I will save thee.’ ‘How am I to rear thee?’ It said, ‘Aslong as we are small, there is great destruction for us: fish devours fish. Thouwilt first keep me in a jar. When I outgrow that, thou wilt dig a pit and keepme in it. When I outgrow that, thou wilt take me down to the sea for then Ishall be beyond destruction.’ It soon became a large fish … Thereupon it said,‘In such and such a year that flood will come. Thou shalt attend to me [i.e. tomy advice] by preparing a ship; and when the flood has risen thou shalt enterinto the ship and I shall save thee from it.’ After he had reared it in thisway, he took it down to the sea. And in the same year which the fish hadindicated to him, he attended to the advice of the fish by preparing a ship; andwhen the flood had risen he entered into the ship. The fish then swam up to him,and to its horn he tied the rope of the ship and by that means he passed swiftlyup to yonder northern mountain. It then said, ‘I have saved thee. Fasten theship to a tree; but let not the water wash thee away30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn30] whilst thou art on the mountain.As the water subsides, thou mayest gradually descend!’ Accordingly he graduallydescended, and hence that slope of the northern mountain is called ‘Manu’sdescent’.31 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn31]In this version, Manu survives the deluge alone, with no mention of the ‘SevenSages’ and with no other human companions. How then does he qualify for hisVedic role as the father of mankind?According to the Satpatha Brahmana:Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. Duringthis time he also … offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, wheyand curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year … With her he went onworshipping and performing austerities, wishing for offspring. Through her hegenerated this race, which is this race of Manu …32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn32]‘THE SHIP WHIRLED LIKE A REELING AND INTOXICATED WOMAN …’Maintaining the sequence of the established chronology, the next properlyconnected version of the Manu story comes to us in the Mahabaratha. In thisrecension of the old tale Manu is not a king but a powerful rishi (sage, seer)who spends a supernaturally long time practising yogic austerities:standing with uplifted arm, on one foot, he practised intense, austere fervour.This direful exercise he performed with his head downwards, and with unwinkingeyes, for 10,000 years. Once, when clad in dripping rags with matted hair, hewas so engaged, a fish came to him on the banks [of a river] and spake, ‘Lord Iam a small fish; I dread the stronger ones, and from them you must save me.’33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn33]With a few more details the tale then proceeds in the same manner as in theSatpatha Brahmana with the fish being cared for and attended to by the kindlyManu, outgrowing various habitats and finally being placed by him in the ocean:When he had been thrown into the ocean he said to Manu: ‘Great lord, thou hastin every way preserved me: now hear from me what thou must do when the timearrives. Soon shall all these terrestrial objects … be dissolved. The time forthe purification of the worlds has now arrived. I therefore inform thee what isfor thy greatest good. The period dreadful for the universe has come. Make forthyself a strong ship, with a cable attached; embark in it with the Seven Sagesand stow in it, carefully preserved and assorted, all the seeds which have beendescribed of old … When embarked in the ship, look out for me: I shall comerecognizable by my horn … These great waters cannot be crossed over withoutme.34 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn34]When the deluge came:Manu, as enjoined, taking with him the seeds, floated on the billowy ocean inthe beautiful ship. [The arrival of the enormous fish is then announced.] WhenManu saw the horned leviathan, lofty as a mountain, he fastened the ship’s cableto the horn. Being thus attached the fish dragged the ship with great rapidity,transporting it across the briny ocean which seemed to dance with its waves andthunder with its waters. Tossed by the tempests the ship whirled like a reelingand intoxicated woman. Neither the earth, nor the quarters of the worldappeared; there was nothing but water, air and sky. In the world thusconfounded, the Seven Sages, Manu and the fish were beheld. So, for very manyyears, the fish unwearied drew the ship over the waters; and brought it atlength to the highest peak of Himavat [the Himalayas]. He then smiling gently,said to the Sages, ‘Bind this ship without delay to this peak.’ They did soaccordingly. And the highest peak of Himavat is still known by the name ofNaubandhana (‘the Binding of the Ship’).35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn35]Thereafter, through his advanced yogic powers Manu, the father, ‘began visiblyto create all living beings’.36 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn36]‘THE SEA WAS SEEN OVERFLOWING ITS SHORES …’A third example – amongst so many more that it is invidious to chose – comesfrom the Bhagvata Purana where Manu first bears the name of Satyaravrata, ‘thelord of Dravida’37 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn37] [south India].In the usual way this Manu encounters a small fish, it grows big and heeventually throws it into the sea. It then reveals itself to him as none otherthan an incarnation of the god Vishnu, who warns him of the impending flood –which here, as the Mahabaratha also hints, acquires the cosmic and universaldimension of the great pralaya that brings each yuga, or age of the earth, to anend:On the seventh day after this the three worlds shall sink beneath the ocean ofthe dissolution. When the universe is dissolved in that ocean, a large ship,sent by me, shall come to thee. Taking with thee the plants and various seeds,surrounded by the Seven Sages … thou shalt embark on the great ship and shaltmove without alarm over the one dark ocean …38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn38]The fish incarnation of Vishnu then vanishes, promising to return at the rightmoment. Seven days later: ‘The sea, augmenting as the great clouds poured downtheir waters, was seen overflowing its shores and everywhere inundating theearth.’39 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn39]Next, the ship of Vishnu appears and Manu and the Seven Sages embark in it –with Manu not failing in his duty to bring on board ‘the various kinds ofplants’.40 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn40]Last but not least the great fish returns. Manu’s Ark is moored to its horn andtowed safely across the flood and storm waves.41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn41]FLESHING OUT THE VEDIC FLOOD MYTHIs this ancient tradition entirely mythical and symbolic, or could it beanchored at some level in geological reality and historical time?My impression, perhaps quite wrong, is that the later texts of the traditiondeliberately begin to fill in and clarify the details of the Manu narrativemissing from the numerous ‘customary’ allusions to him in the Vedas that seem totake a widespread and detailed knowledge of his story for granted.Perhaps this setting down in writing of the ancient tradition in its late daysarose from a recognition that such widespread knowledge could no longer berelied upon and a fear that the oral compositions might eventually be completelylost. The result, at any rate, is that we can now guess exactly why the Rigspeaks of Manu as the father of mankind. It is because in the ancient traditionsof the Vedic peoples – so well known to all in the early days that no writtenelaboration was thought necessary – he was remembered as the survivor of theuniversal flood through whose virility and yogic powers the human race and allliving beings were propagated again after the cataclysm. We now also have thefollowing other pieces of information at our disposal: 1. Manu made a special point of bringing something very precious and significant with him from the world before the flood – a cache of ‘plants and various seeds’ by means of which agriculture could be restored in post-diluvian times. 2. lso with Manu in the ship were the Seven Sages. 3. The character of the flood was that ‘the sea … was seen overflowing its shores and everywhere inundating the earth’. 4. Borne up on the waters of the flood, and towed by a god, Manu’s survival ship travelled towards the north. 5. Manu and the Sages made landfall on the slopes of the ‘Northern Mountain’ in Himavat – the Himalayas. 6. They were to descend from the mountain ‘gradually’, and only as the flood subsided, making sure never to put themselves in a position where they could be ‘washed away’. 7. Manu was believed to have practised yoga. 8. Manu was believed to have been, in antediluvian times, a king of the Dravidian people of south India.A SHIP IN THE HIMALAYAS?Despite the formidable reputation of India’s oral tradition for preserving andtransmitting extremely ancient information, I realize that some linguists andhistorians are likely to be sceptical of any attempt to connect what may berelatively late texts about Manu’s survival of the flood to his earlier morefleeting appearances as a ‘household name’ in the Vedas. Nevertheless there is astrange, isolated passage in the Atharva Veda (AV), and another in the Rigitself, which add further merit to the view that the Vedic peoples at the dawnof their civilization were already fully conversant with all the details of theflood myth as they are given in the much later texts – and even used similarsymbols, imagery and language.Of course, it is possible that the later compositions simply echo the olderones, but if that were so I would expect them not just to be similar but to bemuch more similar than they in fact are. In my opinion a sufficient degree ofdifference is evident in the terminology to make it quite unlikely that theSatpatha Brahmana, the Mahabaratha and the Bhagvata Purana, etc., are simplycopying the AV and the Rig and much more likely that the earlier and the laterwritten texts both descended separately from a common, extremely archaic, oralsource. My view on this is buttressed by the fact that the relevant passages inthe AV and the Rig are opaque and meaningless if left to stand alone but beginto make sense to any reader – or listener – who already has knowledge of thebroader tradition of Manu and the flood. This creates a knotty logical paradoxfor those who wish to believe that the connected Manu/flood story is aninvention of the later texts and was not in circulation at the time of the AVand the Rig. The knot can be untangled very simply, however, if we accept thatthe full connected Manu/flood story must indeed have been in circulation(perhaps even very wide circulation) in the earliest Vedic times but was simplynot written down then and remained for much longer in the exclusive domain ofthe oral tradition.As far as I am aware, the peculiarity of the passage in the Atharva Veda wasfirst commented on in the nineteenth century by Professor Albrecht Weber, awell-known German Indologist.42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn42]The passage can be found in Book 19, Hymn 39, Verse 8, and a modern translationhas recently been provided by Sanskrit scholar David Frawley: ‘At the place ofthe ship’s descent at the top of the Himalayas, there resides the vision ofimmortality.’43 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn43] Griffith’s (1895)translation of the same verse reads as follows: ‘Where is the Sinking of theShip, the summit of the Hill of Snow, there is the embodiment of life that diesnot.’44 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn44] In a footnote Griffiththen adds:The Sinking of the Ship: or the place where the ship sank or glided down;probably the Naubandhana of the later Epos [i.e. the Mahabaratha], the highestknown peak of the Himalayas, to which in the great flood Manu fastened hisship.45 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn45]Weber’s 1882 comment on the passage had made essentially the same comparison ofthe Rig Veda and the Mahabaratha. In the latter, the peak of the Himalayas towhich the ship was tied was afterwards called Naubandhana (meaning ‘the bindingor tying of the ship’). Weber pointed out the curious imperfect similarity ofthis concept to the central idea of AV, 19, 39, 8, ‘where the termNavaprabhramsana or “Gliding down of the Ship” is used in connection with thesummit of Himavat’.46 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn46]Since one would not normally expect to see a ship either moored to a mountain orgliding down one, I submit that the presence of such imagery in the AV withoutan accompanying explanation only makes sense if we assume that the singers ofthe Vedic hymns were already very well acquainted with a story of how a ship gotitself into the Himalayas. There are also extremely good reasons to assume thatthe story in oral circulation then was an early version of the compositions thatwere much later written down in the Satpatha Brahmana, Mahabaratha, etc.The passage in the Rig Veda is, if anything, even more indicative of the longpre-existence of this story, with all its essential ingredients. In Book 2, Hymn23, Verse 13 there is suddenly a reference to ‘pure medicines … those that arewholesomest and health-bestowing, those which our father Manu hath selected …’47[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn47] In the mid-nineteenth century theVedic scholar Horace Haymann Wilson was the first to conclude that ‘this alludesto the vegetable seeds which Manu, according to the Mahabaratha, was directed totake with him into the vessel in which he was preserved at the time of thedeluge’.48 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn48]Finally, to return to the Atharva Veda, there is one other unexplained matterraised in AV, 19,39,8. This concerns the association of immortality – ‘life thatdies not’ – with the ‘Place of the Ship’s Descent’ in the Himalayas (or the‘Place of Manu’s Descent’, as the Satpatha Brahmana calls it). Once again, latertexts provide the background story that is presupposed in the Vedas by tellingus that as his reward for saving mankind and the seed of all living creaturesthe gods granted Manu insight into ‘the mystery of the soul’,49[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn49] mastery over ‘all knowledge’50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn50] and more than human powers with alifetime of millions of years so that he might reign for ‘one manvantara’.51[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn51] A manvantara is a period of timewhich the Vedic sages (with uncharacteristic vagueness) describe as ‘about 71’complete cycles of four yugas,52 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn52]equivalent to 64,800,000 years53 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn53]– effective immortality.As readers may already have noticed, there is something familiar about thistradition that Manu was rewarded by the gods with immortality – or at any ratean extremely long life! The same gift was also bestowed (by a supposedlydifferent group of gods) upon Zisudra, the Sumerian flood survivor whosetravails are described in chapter 2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02]:Life like a god they gave him;Breath eternal like a god they brought down for him,… Zisudra the king,The preserver of the name of vegetation and of the seed of mankind.54[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn54]TWO TIMES SEVENAnother extraordinary similarity concerns the presence of Seven Sages in boththe Sumerian and Vedic traditions. Most ancient societies, I concede, had theirsages or seers or wise men – in India they were, and still are, called rishis.But it seems to me to be stretching coincidence too far to find a groupspecifically named the ‘Seven Sages’ prominently associated with two separateancient cultures and to imagine that this did not come about through some sortof connection.In the case of Sumer the Seven Sages were depicted as amphibian, ‘fish-garbed’beings who emerged from the sea in antediluvian times to teach wisdom tomankind.In the case of the Vedas the focus is not on the antediluvian period but on theflood itself and those antediluvians who are claimed to have survived it, namelyManu and the Seven Sages.What do we have so far? * Two groups of seven antediluvian sages, one in ancient Sumer, one in ancient India. * Both groups are associated with fish symbolism of some sort – the Seven Sages of Sumer are themselves half men, half fish, and the Vedic Seven Sages take refuge on Manu’s survival ship, which is towed by a gigantic fish through the raging waters of the deluge. * Both groups of sages perform an identical function – which is to preserve the gifts of civilization and bring them to mankind in their respective areas. * Both groups of sages set an example of asceticism and teach and promote the spiritual life. * Paradoxically, both groups of sages also play an absolutely fundamental and extremely distinctive earthly role as king-makers and as advisers to kings.Perhaps the similarities result from direct cultural exchange and transfer ofideas between ancient India and ancient Sumer? This option is at least worthconsidering, because we already know that the Indus-Sarasvati civilization-whichhas been proposed as the likely mother of the orphaned Vedas – and thecivilizations of ancient Mesopotamia were contemporary and did have contact withone another. The problem as before, however, is that the similarities are notsimilar enough – or, to put it another way, that there are too many differencesbetween the traditions – for them to have resulted from the direct transmissionof the ‘Seven Sages’ idea from one society to the other. Besides, although theIndus-Sarasvati people and the Sumerians undoubtedly traded with and knew oneanother and have left proof of this, the archaeological record also shows thatthey simply did not exchange cultural ideas, themes and motifs – even at themost basic level such as jewellery design, let alone so fundamental a religiousand historical concept as the Seven Sages.The only explanation left then is coincidence.Or the possibility that the two traditions are after all related – not directly,but through a shared legacy from a more ancient and perhaps even forgottencommon ancestor …AN INSTITUTION FOR SAVING THE VEDASWhat is particularly striking about the Indian tradition is the way that thestory of Manu and the Seven Sages is bound up with the ancient yuga theory ofthe cyclical destruction and rebirth of worlds. To this extent it is reminiscentof the story of the inundation of Dwarka; however, in Dwarka’s case we hear ofonly a single city being destroyed while in the case of the flood of Manu – atrue pralaya – the waters overtake the whole earth and (improbably!) reach highenough to maroon a ship in the Himalayas.The Sanskrit texts make it clear that a cataclysm on this scale, though arelatively rare event, is expected to wash away all traces of the former worldand that the slate will be wiped clean again for the new age of the earth tobegin. In order to ensure that the Vedas can be repromulgated for future mankindafter each pralaya the gods have therefore designed an institution to preservethem – the institution of the Seven Sages, a brotherhood of adepts possessed ofunerring memories and supernatural powers,55[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn55] practitioners of yoga, performersof the ancient rituals and sacrifices, ascetics, spiritual visionaries, vigilantin the battle against evil, great teachers, knowledgeable beyond all imagining,who reincarnate from age to age56 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn56]as the guides of civilization and the guardians of cosmic justice.But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start with first principles.THE SEVEN GODLIKE SAGESThe earliest surviving written references to the Seven Sages are in the RigVeda. But as with Manu it is apparent from the nature of the compositions thatan initiated audience has been assumed and that no attempt has been made torender a full connected narrative (quotations from the Griffith translation);57[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn57]Our fathers then were these, the Seven Sages … (4, 42, 8)They value One, only One, beyond the Seven Sages … (10, 82, 2)Those Gods of old, Seven Sages who sat them down to their austere devotion …(10, 109, 4)So by this knowledge men were raised to Sages, when ancient sacrifice sprang up,our Fathers. With the mind’s eye I think that I behold them who first performedthis sacrificial worship. They who were versed in ritual and meter, in hymns andrules, were the Seven Godlike Sages. Viewing the path of those of old, the[later] sages have taken up the reins like chariot-drivers. (10, 130, 6 and 7)There are many additional accounts of individual rishis – and of their deeds,their knowledge, their powers, etc., but the four passages cited above containthe only direct and explicit references to the Seven Sages [Sapta Rishis) in theentire half-million-word corpus of the Rig Veda. The references aretantalizingly brief. Yet they are at the same time surprisingly rich ininformation – rich enough, I think, to allow us to make a few tentativedeductions about Vedic beliefs on this subject: 1. The Seven Sages were considered in some way as the ‘fathers’ of those rishis who controlled the rituals and recited the Vedas in later times. 2. The Seven Sages were held in enormously high esteem, second only to ‘the One, the only One’ – the supreme divine power in the universe. 3. The Seven Sages had formerly been mortal men and had been elevated, through their possession of ‘knowledge’, at the time ‘when ancient sacrifice sprang up’ – presumably at the dawn of the Vedic religion. 4. The Seven Sages were in some way ‘Gods’ or at any rate ‘Godlike’. 5. The Seven Sages performed austerities. 6. The Seven Sages were ritual specialists who knew the ancient rules of metre and memorization that made it possible to preserve and transmit the ‘verses of knowledge’ for the benefit of future mankind. 7. Later generations of sages who continued to perform the ritual functions and to memorize and recite the verses of knowledge – i.e. the Vedas – were (in the words of one nineteenth-century commentator) ‘only imitators of those who preceded them’.58 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn58] It appears that one of the techniques used by subsequent generations to follow ‘the path of those of old’ may have involved yogic visualization (in the ‘mind’s eye’) of the primal gathering of ‘the Seven Godlike Sages … who first performed this sacrificial worship’.MAKERS OF THE VEDASAs with the story of Manu and the flood, the overlapping story of thebrotherhood of Seven Sages who survive the deluge in the Ark with Manu is adifficult jigsaw puzzle scattered across thousands of pages of ancient Sanskrittexts. The leading expert on the subject is Dr John Mitchiner, whose Ph.D.thesis at London University’s School of Oriental and African Studies was on theSanskrit traditions of the Seven Sages and who later published the definitivebook, Traditions of the Seven Rsis59[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn59] (he uses the Sanskrit termthroughout, being a stickler for detail, and not satisfied that the Englishwords ‘sage’ or ‘seer’ perfectly translate all the nuances of the Sanskrit rsior rishi).60 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn60]Mitchiner points out that a fundamental connection exists in Indian thoughtbetween the Sages and the origins of the Vedas – so fundamental that an inquiryinto the latter inevitably ends up being an inquiry into the former as well:The Seven Rsis are … frequently described as being those who composed, are mostconversant with and supremely knowledgeable in the Vedas – as makers of theVedas, knowers of the Vedas and masters of the Vedas … [They are] thought to becomposers of Vedic hymns, and … to come to the earth periodically in order torenew Vedic knowledge among men; they are further depicted as teaching the Vedasand other sacred works to various individuals and pupils, and as praising thelearning, study and recitation of the Vedas.61[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn61]Despite the apparent clarity of the statement, the relationship between theSeven Sages and the composition of the Vedas is and always has been difficult tounravel. According to the doctrine of India’s yuga system as set out by thegreat nineteenth-century Hindu savant Bal Ganghadar Tilak:The Vedas were destroyed in the deluge, at the end of the last age. At thebeginning of the present age the Sages, through tapas [meditation and yogicausterities], reproduced in substance, if not in form, the antediluvian Vedas,which they carried in their memory by the favour of god.62[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn62]So on the one hand we are to understand that it is the role of the Seven Sagesto ‘reproduce’ and repromulgate the ‘antediluvian’ Vedas (which themselves werebelieved to have been the result of an earlier such process of reproduction andrepromulgation). On the other hand, and confusingly, there are other hymns inwhich the Sages are referred to as ‘making’, or ‘generating’ or ‘fashioning’ –i.e. composing – the Vedas.63 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn63]Last but not least there are passages which leave no doubt that the hymns werebelieved originally, in some remote epoch, to have been ‘inspired’, ‘given’, or‘generated’ by the gods and are thus, in essence, revealed knowledge.64[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn64]SECRET COMMUNICATIONDuring the long journeys both intellectual and physical that I have made inIndia I have learned to live with a certain level of ambiguity. Remember thatthe Hindu religion is the child of the Vedas and that in this religion what wethink of as ‘reality’ (i.e. ‘the world of form’, the material universe) is heldto be maya – an illusion or mass hallucination sustained by ignorance anddispersable only by the special knowledge, insight or gnosis that is concealedwithin the Vedas.65 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn65] Since thisknowledge was intended to be earned through individual study and personalasceticism, and yet was conveyed in publicly recited hymns, it was necessary forit to be coded in some way, or for it to make use of cues, images or ideas thatmight have one set of meanings for the laity and a totally different set ofmeanings and associations for those on the path to gnosis. That such a system ofcoding or secret communication was in use is confirmed by the Rig Veda itself inBook 1, Hymn 164, Verse 45 (Griffith translation):Speech hath been measured out in four divisions, the Brahmans who haveunderstanding [gnosis] know them. Three keep in close concealment cause nomotion; of speech men speak only the fourth division.66[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn66]Wilson translates the same passage this way:Four are the definite grades of speech: those Brahmans who are wise know them:three deposited in secret indicate no meaning; men speak the fourth grade ofspeech.67 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn67]THE NEW AND THE OLDThere are enough similar hints68 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn68]scattered here and there throughout the ancient Sanskrit texts to justify acautious approach to the ambiguities about the Seven Sages and their role ineither merely ‘reproducing’, or actually ‘composing’, Vedic hymns – while thesehymns are at the same time understood to consist of revelations from the gods.Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who devoted his scholarly life to unravelling the Vedas andwho approached the subject with an extremely lucid and open mind, suggests thatthere is a way to reconcile these seemingly conflicting utterances. Thisinvolves making a distinctionbetween the expression, language, or form on the one hand and the contents,substance or subject matter of the hymns on the other; and to hold that whilethe expression was human, the subject matter was believed to be ancient orsuperhuman. There are numerous passages in the Rig Veda where the bards speak ofancient poets (purve rishayah), or ancient hymns (1.1.2; 6.44.13;.7.29.4;8.40.12; 10.14.15, etc.] … [or where a hymn is said to be] new [navyasi], yetthe god or the deity to whom it is addressed is old [pratna) or ancient (6.22.7;62.4; 10.91.13, etc.). This shows that the deities whose exploits were sung inthe hymns were considered to be ancient deities. Nay, we have express passageswhere not only the deities but their exploits are said to be ancient, evidentlymeaning that the achievements spoken of in the hymns were traditional and notwitnessed by the poet himself.69 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn69]The Rig Veda is therefore best understood as a multi-layered constructcontaining some extremely ancient information (which is either repeatedverbatim, as handed down from antiquity, or in various ways spoken of, orreferred to, in later compositions) and also a fair amount of much less ancientinformation associated, perhaps, with the various stages and locales ofrepromulgation and dissemination of the Vedas. Moreover, while linguists andhistorians can debate endlessly about the origins, authorship and antiquity ofthese amazing compositions and of the later bodies of texts that descend fromthem, the compositions themselves are absolutely clear on all these points.THE VEDIC PALIMPSESTSThe Vedas describe themselves as being in essence primordial, having beenrevealed to mankind by the gods. After that initial revelation, when the Vedasentered human space and time, a mechanism had to be found to protect the path tognosis enshrined within them from the vicissitudes of the material world – ofwhich the greatest and most deadly of all is the pralaya, the cataclysm, thatseparates one age of the earth from the next. The function of the Seven Sages isto ensure that the Vedas are not lost during these periodic episodes ofdestruction; instead, they are to preserve the hymns in their memories, survivethe flood, and repromulgate the entire corpus again to the new age of men.It is important to note, in the Vedas, and the later explanatory hymns as weknow them today, that this was already understood to have happened many timesbefore70 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn70] – in other words theseVedas were not believed, even by those who recited them in antiquity, to be thefirst Vedas but rather a younger recension separated by countless aeons from theoriginal, salvaged from the most recent pralaya by the Seven Sages in the Ark ofManu, brought to ‘the Place of the Ship’s Descent’ in the Himalayas, and fromthere repromulgated to the present race of men. Moreover, further study of thetexts makes it perfectly clear that even these events are cast far in the pastin the Vedic scenario – that the time of the flood, Manu and the Seven Sages wasitself perceived as having occurred long, long ago by those who said they werethe descendants of Manu and by those later sages who spoke of the Seven Sages astheir ‘Fathers’. Tilak summarizes the issue in the following way:The Vedic Rishis were themselves conscious of the fact that the subject-matterof the hymns sung by them was ancient or antediluvian in character, though theexpressions used were their own productions.71[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn71]The hymns are therefore ‘oral palimpsests’, each imposed on top of an earlierhymn which itself has been ‘reproduced’ from an earlier hymn, which wasreproduced from an even earlier hymn – and so on, back into the night ofprehistory. Often the older layers of the palimpsest show through in the youngercompositions so that everything is jumbled – like archaeological strata thathave been turned over with earth-moving machinery indiscriminately mixing olderand more recent artefacts.As we will see in a later chapter, progress has been made in separating thetruly ancient from the more recent information tangled up in the Vedic hymns –and the results have been surprising.Meanwhile, in summary, it is at least clear that the essential task of the SevenSages, whose own story is set in the remotest antiquity, was that having learnedthe Vedas from the Sages of an even earlier age they should survive thecataclysm and go forth at the beginning of the new age72[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn72] to ‘repromulgate the knowledgeinherited by them, as a sacred trust, from their forefathers’.73[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn73] According to the Matsya Purana:‘What the Seven Sages heard from the Sages of the preceding age, that theynarrated in the next age.’74 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn74]CONNECTIONS HIDDEN IN THE STARS?There are repeated hints in the Sanskrit texts concerning something that soundsvery much like a lineage of Sages – or perhaps a monastic order or a cult knownas ‘the Seven Sages’ which was believed to have replenished its ranks in eachgeneration. Indeed, in some of the texts detailed lists are provided of manygroups of Seven Sages and of the past ages of the earth in which they lived.75[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn75] The Mahabaratha makes explicitmention of ‘the many Seven Sages’.76[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn76] There are even different groupsof Seven Sages assigned to different regions – particularly to northern andsouthern India77 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn77] – whichapparently were believed to have coexisted in different areas at the same time.Out of all this confusion, however, the names Visvamitra, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja,Gotama, Atri, Vasistha and Kasyapa are most frequently mentioned in the earlyliterature as comprising the ‘main’ group of Seven Sages,78[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn78] with Agastaya sometimes cited asan eighth.79 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn79] But another group ofseven ‘Great Sages’ (with Atri and Vasistha overlapping), is given at leastequal prominence: Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha.80[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn80]It is this latter group that is assigned most often to southern India. But atthe same time, curiously and strikingly, there are traditions that associate itsmembers very firmly and vividly with seven stars in the northern sky –specifically the stars that form the prominent ‘Big Dipper’, or ‘Plough’, withinthe larger circumpolar constellation of the Great Bear.81[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn81] The identification of thisconstellation with a bear is extremely ancient and found in many supposedlyunconnected cultures.82 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn82] This mayshed light on an otherwise peculiar passage in the Satpatha Brahmana whichinforms us: ‘The Seven Rishis were in former times called the Rikshas[bears].’83 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn83] Mitchiner comments:In later times the term rksa came to be given a more general meaning, denoting …any star … This more general meaning is, however, in all probability derivativeof the original and more specific meaning denoting the shining stars of the Bearor Ursa Major.84 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn84]The identification of the Seven Sages with this particular group of stars, soapparent in the Indian tradition, is peculiarly resonant of the well-knownancient Egyptian belief in the stellar destiny of the soul.85[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn85] I cannot help but be reminded ofthe Pharaoh’s wish, repeated countless times in the Pyramid Texts, that if inthis lifetime his spirit has been ‘perfected’ then it should upon his death betransformed into a star in the sky.86[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn86]Two areas of the sky were favoured for stellar rebirth by the ancient Egyptians– the region of the constellation of Orion in the southern sky and the region ofthe circumpolar, never-setting, ‘Imperishable’ stars – particularly Kochab87[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn87] in the Big Dipper – in thenorthern sky. Regarding a circumpolar destiny we read in Utterance 419 of thePyramid Texts: ‘Arise … raise yourself that you may travel in company with thespirits … Cross the sky … Make your abode among the imperishable stars …’88[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn88] Regarding a destiny in Orion weread in Utterance 466: ‘O King, you are this great star, the companion of Orion,who traverses the sky with Orion.’89[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn89]I do therefore find it odd, to say the least, that ancient India’s Seven Sagesare given a stellar ‘manifestation’ as the Big Dipper at the heart of thecircumpolar region of the sky, just where the Egyptian Pharaohs wanted to go.Even odder, however, as Mitchiner reports, is that one of the Sages, Visvamitra,is said in both the Ramayana and the Mahabaratha to have transferred a king ofancient India named Trisanku to the sky in bodily form ‘where he now shines asthe constellation of Orion’.90 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn90]KNOWLEDGE AND BALANCEJust like the Heliopolitan priesthood who oversaw the construction of the GreatPyramid of Egypt, what the Sanskrit texts suggest to me is the possibility thatthe ‘Seven Sages’ of ancient India were not a small group of remarkableindividuals but an institution that persevered through time – perhaps for manythousands of years – that recruited new members in each generation, and that wasdedicated to the preservation and transmission to the future of a body ofspiritual knowledge from the remote past.The highly initiated Sages of India were understood to be ascetics who shunnedmaterial pleasures and material things. They are said to have worn simpleclothes made out of natural products such as bark-cloth and to have smearedtheir bodies with ashes. They did not cut their hair but allowed it to grow longand matted. They were strict vegetarians who gathered fruits and roots to liveon, praised abstention from meat91[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn91] and spent the greater part oftheir time in the snow-covered mountain fastnesses of the Himalayas. There itwas said that they withdrew to perform the tapas – or yogic austerities – bymeans of which they were able to strengthen their spiritual power.92[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn92]But the ancient texts also tell us that the Sages did intervene and involvethemselves extensively in mundane affairs – in particular as king-makers and asadvisers to kings who influenced and shaped state policy.93[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn93] Their role in this respect againparallels the role of the Heliopolitan priesthood of ancient Egypt, theking-makers of the Pyramid Age.94 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn94]In both cases the purpose of secular involvement was the same: to guide, shape,form, and maintain indefinitely a society in perfect balance with itself andwith the universe – a society constructed in accordance with what the ancientEgyptians called maat (earthly and cosmic harmony, truth, balance, the ‘rightway’) and what the Hindus still call dharma, a concept that has exactly the samemeanings.95 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn95]Thus we discover that the Seven Sages would from time to time take over as therulers of kingdoms during an interregnum or in the prolonged absence of thelegitimate ruler.96 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn96] They wouldinstruct rulers on the duties of kings.97[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn97] They would also ‘obtain sons forkings’ (if necessary by impregnating the king’s wives themselves!) thus ensuringthe longevity of royal dynasties98[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn98] – since it was felt (in bothancient India and in ancient Egypt) that the presence of a king or pharaoh wasan essential aspect of cosmic balance. When through some mishap there was noking, then it was the task of the Seven Sages to seek out and appoint a new one.In this regard the Mahabaratha tells how, after the destruction of the kinglycaste, ‘the earth – being without kings – started to sink in distress, whereuponKasyapa supported the earth and found new kings for her’.99[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn99]Amongst many other roles related to rulers and the secular order it isinteresting to note that the Seven Sages also frequently cursed kings if theyabused their powers (and it was a very dangerous thing – often fatal – to becursed by a Sage). ‘In such contexts,’ observes Mitchiner:The Rsi comes to be seen not merely as an upholder or teacher of dharma whostrives to maintain righteousness and proper conduct among men, but as the veryembodiment of dharma itself, manifesting dharma in his words and deeds, andpurging with his curse the adharmic actions of others.100[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn100]A SPIRITUAL BASIS TO HISTORY?In conclusion, the more I learned about ‘the Seven Sages’ on my journey throughthe ancient texts and commentaries, the more they began to sound to me like areligious cult armed with powerful spiritual ideas, fired by yogic asceticismand the quest for gnosis, manipulating the development of ‘kingdoms’ in Indiafrom retreats in the Himalayas. And maybe not only kingdoms in India, butelsewhere in the archaic world as well?We’ve seen that the Sanskrit texts speak of two groups of Seven Sages, one forsouth India, one for north India – regions that are widely separatedgeographically. But beyond India it’s worth reminding ourselves again that itwas Seven Sages – also associated with the dissemination of a system ofknowledge – who served as the advisers to kings in ancient Sumer. Is it not acoincidence too far to discover that Seven Sages fulfilled exactly the samefunction in Egypt? According to the remarkable Edfu Building Texts, which Iexamined at length in an earlier book,101[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn101] these Seven Sages and other godscame originally from an island, ‘the Homeland of the Primeval Ones’, said tohave been destroyed suddenly in a great flood during which the majority of its‘divine inhabitants’ were drowned.102[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn102] Arriving in Egypt, those few whosurvived became ‘the Builder Gods, who fashioned in the primaeval time, theLords of Light … the Ghosts, the Ancestors … who raised the seed for gods andmen …’103 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn103]Most historians and archaeologists today more or less automatically project the‘materialist’ basis and structure of modern society (whether in its ‘capitalist’or ‘socialist’ form) back on to societies of the remote past. This belief – thatcivilization is simply a function of economic forces – has in turn dictatedresearch and excavation strategies in the field and profoundly influenced theway that scholars look at ancient texts such as the Vedas. In recent years,however, a thought-provoking counterview has begun to emerge. ‘Our political andeconomic interpretations of history’, argues the Sanskritist David Frawley,‘cannot be true if enlightenment or spiritual realization is the real goal ofhumanity.’104 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn104]Frawley draws attention to the ancient science of yoga in India – how ancient itmay really be is one of the subjects we will consider in the later chapters-andpoints out:The modern view of the development of human civilization is far removed from theevolution of man according to the system of Yoga. The modern idea ofcivilization developing gradually through the growth of technology andscientific thinking contradicts the yogic point of view which rather seesculture as having been originally formulated and passed down by sages … If theessence of civilization is technology then the modern view may be right, but ifit is the culture of spirit, it is quite wrong. By my interpretationcivilization was founded by yogis, seers and sages.105[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn105]Is it conceivable that the Indus-Sarasvati civilization of ancient India couldhave sprung up exactly in the way that the Vedic traditions tell us? Could ithave been the outcome of a programme or even a ‘policy’ instituted by religiousascetics to protect a precious system of knowledge – knowledge from before theflood that was said to have reached India in the Ark of Manu, preserved in thememories of the Seven Sages?"},{"pageContent":"7 / LOST INDIAWhen Varuna and I embark together and urge our boat into the midst of the ocean,we, when we ride o’er the ridges of the waters, will swing within that swing andthere be happy.Rig Veda (8, 88, 3]The Vedic flood story, which is also the story of Father Manu and the SevenSages, contains seemingly absurd elements: a gigantic fish towing the survivalship; no women on board, so Manu must create a wife and progeny by magicalmeans; and a flood so huge and so high that the ship is carried to theHimalayas. There it is ultimately moored to the peak of the ‘northern mountain’,also referred to as ‘the mountain of snow’, in a legendary spot known in theMahabaratha as Naubandhana (‘the Binding of the Ship’) and in the Atharva Vedaas Navaprabhramsana, ‘the Place of the Ship’s Descent’ (or ‘the Place of theSinking of the Ship’).Although it is true that the Himalayas are young mountains in geological terms –mountains that were indeed once under the sea and that are still rising as Indiapushes up against the mass of Asia – I know that I am on absolutely safe groundto state that no oceanic flood in the entire evolutionary history of mankind hasever reached into or even anywhere near these 9000 metre high snow-coveredranges. It is, in other words, a geophysical impossibility for Manu’s Ark tohave been marooned in the Himalayas as the sacred texts of India claim.Yet it is also true that large areas of the Indian subcontinent did experiencesevere oceanic flooding at the end of the Ice Age – particularly between 15,000years ago and 8000 years ago. The floods of that epoch were global phenomena, aswe saw in chapter 3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03]. In the Arabian Seaand the Bay of Bengal, however, they were fuelled and amplified locally by thespectacular meltdown of the Himalayan ice-cap, which was much deeper and moreextensive in the Ice Age than it is today.So, although I remained puzzled by the references to a ship in the Himalayas, Iwas not yet prepared to join the scholars in their opinion that all of this wascomplete fantasy with no historical value. It was time to get more detail onexactly what did happen to India in the crucial epoch of post-glacial floodingfrom 15,000 to 8000 years ago.TWO ANOMALOUS SITES … AND COUNTINGIn chapter 1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01] I reported a bafflingdiscovery that was made in the early 1990s by marine archaeologists working inthe Bay of Bengal along the Tranquebar-Poompuhur coast of southern India nearNagapattinam. Although they did not at the time have sufficient funding toundertake more than a cursory examination, they were able to identify, andrecommend for future investigation, a large, man-made ‘U-shaped structure’flanked by a ‘semi-circular structure’ and an ‘oval-shaped’ mound. What isbaffling about these submerged ruins, on which ‘a few courses of masonry’ can bemade out under thick encrustations of marine growth, is the fact that they werefound 5 kilometres off the present shoreline and at a depth of 23 metres.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn1]I had discussed the Poompuhur structure with S. R. Rao some months previously(see again chapter 1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01]) and had for along time regarded them as being of great potential significance. Nevertheless,local sea-levels in many parts of the world can (and do) rise and fall for allsorts of reasons independent of global sea-level rise – so, while tempting, Iknew that it would be a mistake to jump to conclusions about the age of thePoompuhur ruins just because they are deeply submerged. This was why I put theproblem to Dr Glenn Milne of Durham University, one of the world’s leadingexperts in the cutting-edge science of ‘inundation mapping’ – which uses apowerful computer program to calculate the complex variables and to produceaccurate models of ancient shorelines at chosen dates in chosen locales.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_035_r1.jpg]Milne ran the programme for the coordinates of the Poompuhur site and e-mailedthe result on 12 October 2000:areas currently at 23 m depth would have been submerged about 11,000 yearsbefore the present. This suggests that the structures you mention are 11thousand years old or older!2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn2]The possibility that the traces of a forgotten episode of global prehistorymight indeed lie underwater off the shores of the Indian subcontinent suddenlylooked a good deal more plausible. Previously I had focused on only oneanomalous submerged site – in the north-west off the coast of Gujerat at Dwarka– and it was of uncertain date. But now I had confirmation of a second strongcandidate located at the opposite end of India – in the south-east off the coastof Tamil Nadu – with a provisional dating to the end of the last Ice Age.The next step was to ask Milne and his colleagues in the Department of Geologyat Durham to prepare detailed inundation maps of the whole coastline of greaterIndia as far to the south as the Maldive islands – which straddle the equator –as far to the north and west as Pakistan’s Makran coast half-way to the PersianGulf, and as far to the north and east as the Ganges delta at the top of the Bayof Bengal.Milne e-mailed the results of this new inquiry in mid-December 2000.INDIA 21,300 YEARS AGOHe had prepared four high-resolution maps. The earliest of these (see page 152)shows the subcontinent as it would have looked 21,300 years ago – around thetime of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when the world ocean had sunk to itslowest level.In that epoch India’s coastal plains were everywhere more extensive than theyare today, in some areas they were much more extensive, and in two areas inparticular – around Gujerat in the north-west and around Tamil Nadu in thesouth-east – they were so much more extensive as to make ancient India virtuallyunrecognizable. Is it by chance that it is in these two areas exactly-wheremarine encroachment during the Ice Age meltdown was more dramatic than anywhereelse in the subcontinent – that anomalous underwater ruins have been found?At the LGM a strip of territory at least 100 kilometres wide that is nowentirely submerged was exposed along almost the whole of the west coast of India– a linear distance of 2000 kilometres from the far south, beyond present CapeComorin, to as far north as the Indus delta. However, at about latitude 15degrees north this strip began to widen rapidly. Off modern Goa it was 120kilometres wide, four degrees further north it was close to 500 kilometres wideand at 21 degrees north the Gulf of Cambay was a pleasant valley and the site onwhich the city of Surat now stands would have been as much as 700 kilometresfrom the sea.But as I studied Milne’s inundation map in December 2000 I was most struck bywhat it revealed about Gujerat’s distinctive Kathiarwar peninsula. Todaysurrounded on three sides by the sea (with the Gulf of Cambay to the south, theGulf of Kutch to the north and the Arabian Sea to the west), it was completelylandlocked 21,300 years ago. Even Dwarka with its mysterious submerged ruins –now poised on the extreme north-western ‘horn’ of the peninsula – would thenhave been about 100 kilometres from the sea.All in all, I realized that what western India had lost to the global floodsthat followed the Last Glacial Maximum amounted to a vast coastal domain, nearlythe same size and roughly the same shape as modern California and BajaCalifornia put together, with an area of close to half a million squarekilometres.The second part of the map that was almost unrecognizable was in the south-east,where the underwater structures had been found off Poompuhur.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_036_r1.jpg]Milne’s calculations demonstrated that the Poompuhur site would have been almost100 metres above sea-level at the Last Glacial Maximum, and would have stoodtowards the northern edge of a great peninsula roughly the same size and shapeas the modern Koreas. Enclosing the Palk Strait, which was then a valley, andgrafting a much-enlarged Sri Lanka firmly to the mainland, this lost Ice Agerealm extended from a little below Dondra Head, at about 6 degrees north, as faras modern Pondicherry at around 12 degrees north. Mahabalipuram, with itsneglected legends of the Seven Pagodas and the flooded city of Bali, lies at12.37 degrees north and would have been at least 50 kilometres from the sea atthe Last Glacial Maximum. Meanwhile, to the west of the Sri Lankan peninsula,forming the other side of the Gulf of Mannar – a large enclosed bay at the LGM –a snout of land extended into the Indian Ocean more than 150 kilometres beyondmodern Cape Comorin. Finally, off-shore to the south-west, the ‘necklace’ oftiny atolls that make up the Maldives in the twenty-first century appeared as animposing archipelago on Milne’s map. Greatly enlarged and increased in numberbecause of the lowered sea-level, they included thousands of square kilometresof continuous landmasses at the Last Glacial Maximum that have long sincecompletely vanished.So here again what the inundation map revealed was a substantial, integratedarea – an entire sub-region of India – that had been above water 21,300 yearsago and that is submerged today.16,400 YEARS AGOMilne’s second map did not look very different from the first, although itshowed India almost 5000 years later – at 16,400 years ago.To my eye the south-eastern portion was to all extents and purposes identical inboth maps. In the south the snout-shaped peninsula below Cape Comorin wasslightly reduced in width, but still about the same length, and some of thelarger Maldives had begun to break up.In the south-western sector of the mainland (northwards from the Cape) the 100kilometre wide strip of coastline up as far as latitude 15 degrees north wasthinner – generally between 20 and 50 kilometres thinner – than it had been atthe LGM. But beyond 15 degrees north, where the strip began to widen, the lossof land had been much less severe, indeed negligible. The Gulfs of Cambay andKutch were still filled in, the Kathiarwar peninsula was still landlocked, andDwarka was still about 100 kilometres from the sea.In the light of what I’d learned so far about the chronology of the post-glacialcataclysms, the general lack of dramatic change during this period made perfectsense: 16,400 years ago the meltdown of the last Ice Age had only just begun andthe first of the three global superfloods identified by Professor John Shaw anddiscussed in chapter 3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03] was still morethan a thousand years away.The reader will remember the approximate chronology of those floods, which wereactually prolonged episodes of flooding in all cases – 15,000–14,000 years ago;12,000–11,000 years ago; and 8000–7000 years ago.10,600 YEARS AGOGlenn Milne’s third map showed India as it had looked 10,600 years ago, afterthe first two of the three episodes of flooding had done their work. In the farsouth the ‘snout’ that had protruded beneath Cape Comorin was now almostcompletely inundated, leaving only a lonely island anchored in the Indian Oceanabout 80 kilometres off-shore.To the south-west the Maldives archipelago was much reduced, although theresidual islands were larger than their modern counterparts.In the south-east, I was surprised to see Sri Lanka still attached to Indiaalbeit by a diminished land-bridge – as late as 10,600 years ago. On themainland the coast of Tamil Nadu had in general been reduced almost to today’slevels. Five kilometres off-shore the Poompuhur structures had been inundated.At Mahabalipuram the coastal plain still extended 2 or 3 kilometres further intothe Bay of Bengal 10,600 years ago than it does today – far enough, in theory,for the legendary city of Bali to have been built there as late as that date.On the south-west side of the Indian mainland the strip of coast running fromCape Comorin at 8 degrees north up as far as 15 degrees north now extended lessthan 5 kilometres beyond today’s level. At about 17 degrees north it began towiden as before, but much more gradually. A very large part of the landmassdirectly below the Gulf of Cambay was now flooded by the sea and it was possibleto make out the emergence of the modern shape of the Kathiarwar peninsula.Nevertheless the Gulf of Cambay was still entirely above water 10,600 years ago,so too was the Gulf of Kutch, and the present coastline of the peninsula wasstill surrounded by a healthy margin of dry land. Dwarka was at least 40kilometres from the sea. Off-shore of Dwarka to the south-west there was anisland about 50 kilometres in length – a remnant of the formerly much extendedcoastline in these parts. A second much larger island – 400 kilometres long andalmost 100 kilometres wide – lay a little further to the south and extended downto well beyond modern Bombay.4800 YEARS AGOWhen I turned to study the final map of the four received from Milne it showedthat sea-level was slightly higher 4800 years ago than it is today, marking thepost-glacial high-stand of the sea. In the far south the Maldive islands hadalmost completely vanished and Sri Lanka was fully isolated from the mainlandand in its modern form. On the mainland itself most parts of the coast wereindistinguishable from those on a modern map, although the eminence on whichDwarka stands today would have been an island at that date. Much moresignificant marine incursions into areas that are now mostly dry land were showninto the Rann of Kuch and the Gulf of Cambay in the north-west and aroundPoompuhur-Tranquebar in the south-east.But this made sense. I remembered that in the Persian Gulf too the sea-level hadbeen a metre or two higher around 5000 years ago – as a result of a worldwideepisode of rapid, relatively short-term flooding known as the Flandriantransgression.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn3] Presumably inIndia, as in the Gulf, the land had later been recovered thanks to thesubsequent regression of sea-level to the modern value, combined with the localeffects of silting. Indeed the salt-flats of the Rann remain susceptible tomarine transgressions to this day and by 4800 years ago had become, temporarily,a large navigable extension of the Gulf of Kutch, scattered with numerousislands, that would not dry up for another thousand years. Into that gulf as faras Dholavira, the trade of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization was soon to bebrought in great high-prowed ocean-going ships – the ships depicted on theterracotta seals of the mid-third millennium BC, the ships that also sailedfurther south, through the extended Gulf of Cambay, to the now landlocked portof Lothal.The amount of time that Glenn Milne was able to spend making inundation maps forme was strictly limited, but there was a period within the range of 21,300 to4800 years ago that I particularly wanted him to do some more modelling on. Ialready knew by comparing his map for 21,300 years ago with his map for 10,600years ago what lands had been surrendered to the sea during the first two globalfloods (15,000–14,000 years ago and 12,000–11,000 years ago). Now I wanted morefine detail on what had happened between 8000 and 7000 years ago, when the thirdepisode of global superfloods had been unleashed. Just to be on the safe side Iasked Milne to give me a complete sequence of maps covering the period from13,500 years ago down to the present.WHAT IF?India is so big that I sometimes find it difficult to conceive of it all atonce. Now after my first session with the inundation maps it seemed to bedividing itself conveniently into the two great cultural, linguistic andgeographical regions into which it has always divided itself – at least sincethe time of the Rig Veda – namely the Dravidian-speaking south and theIndo-European-speaking north.In both these areas there had been extensive post-glacial flooding, and I wasdetermined to dive in both if I could. But the south was far from the Himalayas,with which the Vedas associate the escape of the Seven Sages and Manu from theflood, while the north-west coast around modern Gujerat was not only much closerbut also had lost more land more rapidly than any other part of India.The conjunction begged an obvious speculation. What if by extraordinary bad lucksome kind of civilization had been based in precisely this area, on land thathad been inundated 11,000 or 8000 years ago at the end of the Ice Age?If so, then it was by no means inconceivable that the survivors might have fledto the Himalayas, pretty much as the Vedic traditions state. They could not havegot there by boat, of course. But if a boat had played an essential part intheir survival of the flood then it was easy to see how the whole adventuremight have been dramatized and remembered in later times as a boat journey.I could think of several good arguments against this scenario. In no particularorder: (1) What right had I to assume that there had been any civilization atall, anywhere, 11,000 or 8000 years ago? (2) Even in the unlikely event that aculture that was a little out of the ordinary had existed at that time, and hadso far escaped discovery by archaeologists, why should it have chosen toconcentrate itself in the very part of India that would suffer the mostextensive post-glacial inundations – when there were so many other parts ofIndia to choose from? (3) Even if both the prior improbabilities are granted andwe accept that a civilization was there and was flooded, why did its survivorsretreat all the way to the Himalayas? There was perfectly safe land in betweenthat would have been much more congenial for settlement and for agriculture(presumably an important priority to Manu, who made such a point of ‘saving thename of vegetation’ and of bringing with him ‘all the seeds which have beendescribed of old’).4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn4]Yet history is full of examples of improbable things that have happened. It wasthought improbable in the nineteenth century that a European army could ever bedefeated in battle by an African army – until the Abyssinians routed theItalians at Adowa in 1896. It was thought improbable that the Titanic would sinkon her maiden voyage, but she did. The residents of Pompeii obviously thought itwas improbable that their city would be smothered by an eruption of Vesuvius,but it was.So let’s just ask the question and be damned: what if a prehistoric people, withmore sophisticated spiritual ideas and a more developed culture than is known tohave existed elsewhere in India at this time, had evolved on theCalifornia-sized coastal domain between Goa and the Indus delta before it wasinundated at the end of the Ice Age? What would have happened to that culturewhen the deluge came? What sort of story might its survivors have told? And-theheart of the matter really – could it be that story that is expressed in theVedas?THE HYPOTHESIS THAT NO ONE HAS TESTEDEven in the twenty-first century, long after it supposedly relinquished itsgrip, the dead hand of the ‘Aryan invasion of India’ theory still moulds ourperceptions of the Vedas. The assumption that there ever was such a thing as aninvasion, or even a distinct ethnic group called the Aryas, may have beenabandoned, but we’ve seen in previous chapters how scholars have retained theclosely related assumption (albeit within a much wider time-scale) of anoverland migration of semi-nomadic or transhumant tribes towards India fromsomewhere in the general direction of Europe.Underlying this assumption are other assumptions about the state of developmentof the migrants (in the early days of ‘the transition to agriculture’); aboutthe kind of land that they might have inhabited before coming to India (plains,valleys, mountains); and about the various ‘environmental challenges’(desertification, drastic changes in rainfall and temperature regimes, etc.) or‘economic pressures’ (overpopulation, competition for scarce resources) thatmight have compelled them to migrate in the first place.Because assumptions are free and everybody is entitled to one, the quest for the‘Indo-European homeland’ has become something of a scholarly equivalent of thequest for Atlantis. By various highly ranked authorities at various times it hasbeen placed as far afield as the North Pole, Scandinavia, central Europe,southern Russia, central Asia and eastern Anatolia.5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn5] The suggestion that it might havebeen within India itself has only very rarely been made and then not by Europeanscholars. Indeed in a survey of ‘Recently proposed homelands of the originalIndo-Europeans’ the Sanskritist David Frawley, along with historian of religionGeorge Feuerstein and Professor Subash Kak of Louisiana State University, foundthat only one out of ten of the homelands that had been proposed was in India(and that by an Indian academic) while the other nine were all set much furtherto the north and west.’6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn6]Never, so far as I am aware, has a reputable scholar – Indian or otherwise –ever suggested a Vedic homeland located not only within India but alsoexclusively on the subcontinent’s coastal margins inundated at the end of theIce Age. Nor for that matter do I know of any reputable scholar who has everconsidered oceanic flooding in any shape or form amongst the ‘environmental’challenges that might have compelled a migration of the ‘proto-agricultural’Vedic peoples out of their ‘homeland’ (wherever that was) and into a widertheatre.This seems like an oversight, since the origins of settled agriculture and‘civilization’ in India – indeed of the very urban lineage that culminatedmillennia later in the Indus-Sarasvati civilization itself – are now known byscholars to go back at least as far as #500 years before the present. That isthe approximate date – 6500 BC – of the first habitation strata at theextraordinary prehistoric town of Mehrgarh in Pakistan’s Bolan pass,7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn7] an archaeological site of greatmystery, as we shall see. It is also an early enough date to lie firmly withinthe time-frame of the three episodes of global superfloods at the end of thelast Ice Age.A MARITIME CULTURE?What sort of ancient culture would have chosen to locate itself exclusively in aregion so close to the sea that the recurrent cycles of post-glacial floodsmight have seriously endangered it?In my opinion only a maritime, sea-going culture – indeed a culture that wasdependent on the sea – fits the bill. Moreover, there can be no objection inprinciple to the existence of such a culture in India 8000 or even 15,000 yearsago – since scholars accept that early humans may well have been seafarers asmuch as 40,000 years ago and that by 10,000 years ago lengthy oceanic journeysand difficult navigational feats were being accomplished by supposedly ‘StoneAge’ peoples in many different parts of the world.8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn8]Yet the assumption continues to be that the founders of the Vedic religion – theforefathers of those who sang the Vedic hymns that have come down to us – werehunter-gatherers or nomads or farmers who only reached India after a longoverland journey (itself thought to have been motivated by the demand for moreland). Most Western Indologists studying the Rig Veda have therefore never seenthe need to analyse the many references that its ancient hymns contain to ‘seas’and ‘oceans’. Indeed, only David Frawley, who is far from the mainstream butwhose knowledge of the Vedas cannot be faulted, has attempted a seriousinvestigation of this problem:The modern, generally Western idea is that the Rig Veda is the product of anomadic people invading India from the northwest, who, therefore, could not haveknown anything of the sea … However this idea does not come from the Vedaitself. It is a preconception used to interpret it. We can only discountenancethe many references to the ocean in the Rig Veda by redefining the regularSanskrit terms for ocean presented in it to have meant nothing more than anylarge body of water, river or lake. If we take them as they appear … they fairlyclearly show a maritime culture.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn9]Frawley argues that although forests and deserts are also mentioned in theVedas, familiarity with these does not prove non-familiarity with the ocean:The scope of Vedic geography is quite large, with mountains, plains, rivers andseas. This allowed scholars to focus on one side of it and become caught up inthat one aspect. Yet the oceanic symbolism appears to be the most common.10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn10]So much so, Frawley points out, that Ralph Griffith, the translator of the Vedas– who did not accept that the Vedic peoples had any experience of oceans – wascompelled almost 100 times to translate various Vedic terms as ‘ocean’ or ‘sea’,because this is exactly what those terms mean and no alternative translation ispossible.11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn11] Other more ambiguousmaritime references, in Frawley’s view, were mistranslated or treated simply asmetaphors. And while he admits that the word ‘ocean’ in the Vedas is sometimesused as a metaphor (the ‘ocean of heaven’ for example), he argues persuasivelythatsuch images do not reflect a lack of contact with the earthly ocean … They showgreat intimacy with the sea, not just as a practical fact but as a poetic imageimpressed on them by life in proximity to it.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn12]Nor are the maritime images in the Vedas confined to seas and oceans. They alsoinclude descriptions of sailing, of ships and of ship-borne trade. According toProfessor S. P. Gupta:There are … references to sea, i.e. samudra, and traders, i.e. panis, engaged inseaborne trade; navah, samudiiah, sata-aritia, etc. are such terms which clearlyindicate it. Even piracy is mentioned. Attack by unscrupulous people on boatsladen with goods in order to capture them finds clear mention in terms likeduseva, tamovridha.13 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn13]IF YOU LISTEN TO THE VEDAS YOU CAN HEAR THE OCEANScholars have long regarded it as legitimate to make firm deducations about thebiblical world – its economy, its history, its environment, its sense ofgeography, its social organization, etc. – by studying the Old Testament.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn14] When the same approach is appliedopen-mindedly to the Rig Veda, you can hear the ocean:All sacred songs have magnified Indra, expansive as the sea. (1, 11, 1)He [the god Varuna] knows the path of birds that fly through heaven, and … ofthesea, He knows the ships that are thereon … (1, 25, 7)Like as a watery ocean so doth he [Indra] receive the rivers spread on all sidesin their ample width … (1, 55, 2)The Seven mighty Rivers seek the ocean. (1, 71, 7)O thou whose face looks every way, bear us past foes as in a ship … As in a shipconvey thou us for our advantage o’er the flood. (1, 97, 7–8)Come in the ship of these our hymns to bear you to the hither shore. (1, 46, 7)Yea Asvins [two ‘divine intermediaries’ or ‘guardian angels’ frequently referredto in the Vedas], as a dead man leaves his riches, Tugra left Bhujyu in thecloud of waters … Ye brought him back in animated vessels … Bhujyu ye bore … tothe sea’s farther shore, the strand of ocean … Ye wrought that hero exploit inthe ocean which giveth no support, or hold, or station, what time ye carriedBhyjyu to his dwelling borne in a ship with hundred oars, O Asvins. (1, 116,3–5)Ye ever-youthful Ones … ye brought back Bhujyu from the sea of billows …uninjured through the ocean … (1, 118, 14–15)O Asvins … Ye made for Tugra’s son [Bhujyu], amid the water floods, thatanimated ship with wings [sails?] to fly withal, whereon … ye brought him forth.And fled with easy flight from out the mighty surge. Four ships, most welcome inthe midst of ocean, urged by the Asvins, saved the son of Tugra, him who wascast down headlong in the waters …(1, 182, 5–6)O Maruts [sky and storm gods], from the Ocean ye uplift the rain, and fraughtwith vaporous moisture pour the torrents down. (5, 55, 5)Earth shakes and reels in terror at their [the Maruts’] onward rush, like a fullship which, quivering, lets the water in. (5, 59, 2)May Aja-Ekapad, the God, be gracious, gracious the Dragon of the Deep, and Ocean…(7, 36, 13)Let not the sinful tyranny of any fiercely-hating foe smite us as billows smitea ship. (8, 64, 9)As rivers swell the ocean, so, Hero, our prayers increase thy might. (8, 88, 8)Ye furtherers of holy Law, transport us safe o’er many woes as over water-floodsin ships. (8, 72, 3)When Varuna and I embark together and urge our boat into the midst of the ocean,we, when we ride o’er the ridges of the waters, will swing within that swing andthere be happy. (8, 88, 3)In both the oceans hath his home, in eastern and in western seas. (10, 136, 5)Well knoweth Savitar [the personification of the Sun as a life-giving force]where ocean, firmly fixt, o’erflowed its limit. (10, 149, 2)Although the Vedas are eloquent on their own behalf, the passages above (quotedfrom the Griffith translation and representative of many other passages notreproduced here) do seem to raise a number of queries.For example, as well as confirming a knowledge of the relationship betweenrivers and oceans – with references to rivers seeking the ocean, pouring intoit, etc. – we are also presented with the concept of rivers filling up theocean, quite a different matter. When was the last time that human beings arelikely to have seen rivers literally filling up the ocean (rather than justflowing into it and making no difference to its level as they do today)? Couldit have been the time when the ocean, previously thought to have been firmlyfixed in its place, ‘o’erflowed its limit’ and when only those on board shipswere safe from its floods?And what about the Maruts, the storm gods, who ‘from the Ocean … uplift therain, and fraught with vaporous moisture pour the torrents down’? Knowledge ofthe workings of our planet’s great ocean-evaporation-cloud-rainfall cycle is notsomething that we normally ascribe to proto-agricultural nomads who have neverbeen near an ocean in their lives. But the idea should occur naturally to anyonewho lives in sight of a coast – where, at times, the clouds do seem visibly tobe drawing up moisture from the sea.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn15]Also amongst the quoted passages are references to the ‘eastern and the westernseas’, and to ‘both the oceans’. These references suggest a rather widespreadmaritime experience (at the very least, presumably, of the Arabian Sea to thewest of India and of the Bay of Bengal to the east).Then we must consider the question of all those references to ships – hardly asubject of great interest or relevance to landlubbers but something that wewould naturally expect to encounter in the discourse of mariners. And whatships! Ships in which to ride out the ‘water-flood’ as we have seen … ships soformidable and so secure that they are used as a metaphors for safety, securityand protection … ships, with great sails and banks of oars, that fly across thewaves so fast they hardly seem to get wet … ships that can brave the billows andpull off the spectacular rescue ‘from out the mighty surge’ of a man lostoverboard and then return him safe to his dwelling on ‘the strand of ocean’.Last but not least, and again as we would expect with a maritime people, thereis knowledge both of the dreads and dangers of the sea and of its joys andpleasures. Thus, on the one hand, there is the delightful hymn to Varuna whichcould only have been composed by someone completely at ease with the motions ofthe sea and the way that a sailing ship behaves as it skips the ridges of gentlewaves or lies at anchor rocking on the swell. On the other hand, these ancientcompositions also offer an insight into the awful predicament of the human lostalone in the ocean ‘which giveth no support, or hold, or station’. In a fewsimple words and images they allow us to know the fear and victimization felt bythose on board a ship that is being mercilessly pummelled by storm waves‘smiting’ it ‘like a fiercely-hating foe’. With the same minimal but effectivedescription we learn of the ‘terror’ experienced by its sailors when an injuredship ‘quivers’ and begins to ‘let the water in’. And then there are suchcreatures to appease as the ‘Dragon of the Deep’ – aquatic monsters that wouldbe out of place in fields or mountains but seem quite at home in the fantasiesand experiences of a maritime people.I therefore find much in the Rig Veda to recommend the hypothesis that itsoriginal composers must have lived close to the sea and been familiar with theways of the sea over a long period of time. This, at the very least, improvesthe odds in favour of a possibility briefly raised in previous chapters – namelythat the Vedas (a superb religious literature with no known parent) might infact have been the work of the undeniably maritime Indus-Sarasvati civilization(which was long known to have possessed a script but apparently had no religiousliterature).In that case the mystery of the origins of the Vedas would converge with themystery of the origins of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization – origins that arereceding further and further back into the past with each new turn of thearchaeologists’ spade at sites such as Mehrgarh and Nausharo in Baluchistan thatare already confirmed to be more than 8000 years old.I remind the reader again that 8000 years before the present is within thetime-frame of the great post-glacial floods.HIDDEN TREASURESWe’ve seen that the scholarly chronology really has no bearing, one way oranother, on the ultimate age of the Rig Veda. Even the date of 1200 BC that isgenerally used turns out to be for codification only, with all concerned readyto admit that many of the actual compositions must be older – although exactlyhow much older nobody knows.It’s also obvious that the Rig is a composite work, recension after recension,layer upon layer, and that part of the difficulty of interpreting it probablycomes from a jumbling of earlier with later material. Similarly, as GregoryPossehl argues, it looks like a work that underwent a long period ofcomposition, ‘when new material was added and older verses were edited andchanged’. Then at some point ‘this flexibility in composition stopped and thepriests defined their text as immutable, not to be changed by one word or evenone syllable, and the slightest mispronunciation or deviation from the canon wasbelieved to be a sacrilege’.16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn16]So in a sense what the Rig presents us with is a dynamic body of scripture andoral history that kept on changing and growing, retaining its dynamism –conceivably even for thousands of years – before being frozen in amber and thenpreserved eternally in its interrupted form for later study and reflection.I see no need to get into the argument about when, precisely, that ‘freezing inamber’ might have occurred, or join with the scholars in bickering about a fewhundred years here or there. I’m much more interested in the possibility thatlayers of extremely ancient oral history and tradition could be concealedalongside the much more recent material that the Rig also undoubtedly contains.THE CASE OF THE VANISHING RIVERThere is a river, spoken of repeatedly in the Rig Veda, that vanished into theearth – though not from human memory – thousands of years ago and that was onlyrevealed again by satellite imaging and remote-sensing technology in the latterhalf of the twentieth century. It is the Sarasvati – the very same ancient riverwhich now gives its name to the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, because largenumbers of ‘Harappan’ and ‘pre-Harappan’ archaeological sites, dating back atleast to the fourth millennium BC, have been discovered close to its formercourse. The Sarasvati began to dry out towards the end of the third millenniumBC and to all extents and purposes had ceased to flow by the early secondmillennium BC. Even now, however, notes Gregory Possehl,there is a river bed, kilometres wide in some places and heavily cultivated,that the people of Haryana refer to as ‘Sarasvati’. During the monsoon, parts ofthis channel carry small amounts of water, most of which is quickly captured forirrigation. Thus the river that today’s people call Sarasvati is not entirelydead …17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn17]There is a bigger question to ask, however: when was it entirely alive? When,for example, was the Sarasvati alive enough to merit these descriptions of it inthe Rig Veda?Sarasvati, the mighty flood …18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn18]Coming together, glorious, loudly roaring – Sarasvati, Mother of Floods … withfair streams strongly flowing, full swelling with the volume of their water …19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn19]She with her might … hath burst with strong waves the ridges of the hills … Yea,this divine Sarasvati, terrible with her golden path, foe-slayer … whoselimitless unbroken flood, swift-moving with a rapid rush, comes onward withtempestuous roar … Yea, she most dear amidst dear streams … graciously inclined,Sarasvati hath earned our praise.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn20]In the footnotes to his 1889 translation, long before the era of satellites andremote sensing, Griffith commented on the use of the word ‘she’ in the aboveverse and expressed a certain geographical puzzlement:She: Sarasvati as a river. The description given in the text can hardly apply tothe small stream generally known under that name; and from this and otherpassages which will be noticed as they occur it seems probable that Sarasvati isalso another name of Sindhu, or the Indus.21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn21]Griffith did not for a moment consider the possibility that the Sarasvati of theVedas might have been a much greater ‘stream’ in the distant past than it istoday (thus justifying the Rig’s description), and even translated withoutcomment another passage that negates his own hypothesis by speaking of bothrivers in the same verse:Let the great Streams come hither with their mighty help, Sindhu [Indus],Sarasvati, and Sarayu with waves. Ye Goddess Floods, ye Mothers, animating all,promise us water rich in fatness and in balm …22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn22]Because the Rig is in fact clear on the matter, scholars have long since givenup the attempt to brush off the anomalous descriptions of the Sarasvati bytrying to pretend that the Indus was meant. Nor-because of the perfectconformity between the ancient descriptions of a massive Sarasvati and thelatest scientific evidence of a formerly massive Sarasvati – does there seem tobe much mileage in writing it all off as hyperbole or poetic licence. ThusPossehl is prepared to concede:The image created in the Rig Veda for the Sarasvati River is one of a powerful,full-flowing river, not easily reconciled with the literal meaning of the name‘Chain of Pools’. The discrepancy cannot simply be dismissed; swept under thecarpet. It is a good example of how difficult it can be to use the Rig Veda, andthe Vedic texts generally, as historical sources.It could be that when the composers of the Vedas first came to the Sarasvati itwas a river of great magnitude, and these recollections are what we read intheir texts. But over time the stream was robbed of its headwaters and dried up,becoming a chain of pools. For whatever reason, the name was changed andSarasvati is the name that was preserved in the texts; awkward to be sure, butprobably not insurmountable. This carries an interesting chronologicalimplication: the composers of the Rig Veda were in the Sarasvati region prior tothe drying up of the river and this would be closer to 2000 BC than it is to1000 BC, somewhat earlier than most of the conventional chronologies for thepresence of Vedic Aryans in the Punjab.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn23]Possehl understates his case. The ‘chronological implications’ of Vedic Aryansin the Punjab by 2000 BC are much more than ‘interesting’. They are potentiallydevastating for the academic edifice of Indian literary history founded on adate for the Rig Veda of around 1200 BC – and thus for every assumption aboutIndian prehistory that has ever been based on such a date for the Rig. At thevery least, if this is what the references to a full and powerful Sarasvatimean, then the possibility of a connection between the Indus-Sarasvaticivilization and the Vedic religion must be greatly enhanced.But the plot thickens …FROM MOUNTAIN TO OCEANAs well as presenting us with images of a powerful, fast-flowing, roaring river(that would seem to be have been historically accurate for the Sarasvati at anytime up until the end of the third millennium BC) the Rig Veda tells ussomething else, very, very clearly, that at first sight does not appear to behistorically accurate at all. It tells us that the Sarasvati known to the Vedicpriests and sages ran unbroken from the mountains to the ocean:This stream Sarasvati with fostering current comes forth, our sure defence … theflood flows on, surpassing in majesty and might all other waters. Pure in hercourse from the mountains to the ocean …24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn24]The problem, in a nutshell, is this: the satellite studies indicate that thelast time the Sarasvati flowed into any ocean may have been more than 10,000years ago – in other words during the final millennia of the post-glacialmeltdown. In a paper in the specialist journal Remote Sensing, S. M. Ramaswamy,P. C. Bakliwal and R. P. Verma make the following observations about thesatellite data from which they draw this very important conclusion about the‘palaeo-Sarasvati’:The occurrence of well-developed tentacles of palaeo-channels in the vast IndianDesert [north-east of the Rann of Kutch] and the final arm of the palaeo-channelas the Ghaggar … show that River Sarasvati flowed close to the Aravalli hillranges [and] met the Arabian Sea in the Rann of Kutch.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn25]The exact epoch in which the Sarasvati stopped flowing ‘pure in her course’ tothe Arabian Sea and began to lose her way instead in the thirsty sands of theIndian Desert is not yet known with any certainty. Nevertheless, Ramaswamy,Bakliwal and Verma are quite satisfied that it was not in the ‘Holocene’ (themost recent geological age) but in the ‘late Pleistocene’ – about 12,000 yearsago.26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn26] The same approximate datehas also been suggested by Bhimal Ghose, Anil Kar and Zahrid Jussain in a studyfor the Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Jodhpur,27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn27] and by Ghose et al. in theGeographical Journal.28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn28] B. P.Radhakrishna of the Geological Society of India similarly indicates the periodbetween 8000 and 6000 BC as the time when melting ice-sheets in the Himalayas,accompanied by a great increase in precipitation, allowed ‘Sarasvati and all itstributaries [to flow] in full majestic splendour’.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn29] If all these scientists areinterpreting the data correctly, then it is only to follow Possehl’s own logicto observe that the combination of the remote-sensing evidence and the textualevidence carries an interesting chronological implication: the composers of theRig Veda were in the Sarasvati region at a time when that river still ran allthe way to the sea, and this would be closer to 8000 BC than it is to 1000 BC.It goes without saying that such a date is not just ‘somewhat earlier’ butdramatically, startlingly, inexplicably earlier than any of the conventionalchronologies for the presence of Vedic Aryans in the Punjab. So has the modernscience of remote sensing revealed one of the deeper layers of the Vedicpalimpsest? Or is it just a fluke that what appears to be an accurategeographical account of the Sarasvati river as it last looked 10,000 or even12,000 years ago seems to have been preserved in the Rig2.Since leading mainstream scholars like Gregory Possehl have already all butaccepted the heretical possibility that Vedic civilization was present in thePunjab by 2000 BC (on the basis of the colourful description of a full andturbulent Sarasvati) it seems invidious of them to ignore or sidestep the Rig’sequally colourful description of the Sarasvati flowing to the sea. However, thisis exactly what Possehl does. Quoting the relevant passage (‘pure in her coursefrom the mountains to the ocean’), he admits that ‘the Vedic pundits thoughtthat the Sarasvati went to the sea’ but explicitly advises students to treatthis observation ‘critically, not literally’30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn30] – presumably because to take theobservation literally would imply an ‘impossibly’ early date for Vediccivilization.UNDER VEDIC SKIESThere are other passages within the Rig – not to do with rivers at all – whichalso appear to contain material of very great antiquity. These particularlyconcern astronomical observations of various stars and groups of stars at setseasons – the spring and autumn equinoxes and the summer and winter solstices.Because of a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, the technicaldetails of which need not detain us here,31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn31] the constellations seen at theseseasons slowly and magisterially trade places, as though revolving on a greatbelt in the heavens, at the rate of one degree every seventy-two years with afull cycle of just under 26,000 years.32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn32] Thus, if an ancient text says ‘wesaw the star such-and-such or the constellation such-and-such rising at dawn atmidsummer’, then it is possible with modern astronomical formulae to calculateapproximately when that observation must have been made.There are numerous statements of this sort about stars and the seasons in theRig Veda which, if taken at face value, suggest that the Vedic sages madeobservations of the sky for thousands of years and from time to time addedverses or hymns incorporating new astronomical data to the pre-existingcompilation. The problem is that the range of dates, going back to the sameepoch as the Sarasvati material, has always been thought of as too outlandish tobe taken seriously by the majority of scholars.This is, however, not quite a uniform view. Two of the highly respected Vedicscholars of the late nineteenth century, Professor H. Jacobi and Bal GanghadarTilak, were in no doubt that very ancient celestial observations are embeddedwithin the Rig. On the basis of astronomical references Jacobi dated most of thehymns to the epoch of 4500–2500 BC.33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn33] And although Tilak’s morecomprehensive study found the greatest concentrations of references pointing toapproximately the same period, he noted that earlier dates were also flagged.34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn34] Tilak thought that the mostprolific epoch of Vedic composition had been between 4000 and 2500 BC – the‘Orion period’ as he called it – in which references are found ‘from the timethat the vernal equinox was in the asterism of Ardra to the time when it recededto the asterism of the Khtikas [the Pleiades]’.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn35] But he also identified an oldersub-layer of Vedic hymns with what he called ‘the Aditi or the pre-Orionperiod’, stating: ‘we may roughly assign 6000–4000 BC as its limit’.36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn36]More recently David Frawley has pointed to other references which may carry theRig Veda’s astronomical testimony back even earlier than 6000 BC, indeed‘possibly as early as 7000 BC when the [winter] solstice first entered [theconstellation of] Ashwini’37 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn37](i.e., when the winter solstice was at or very near the beginning of theconstellation of Aries).38 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn38]Frawley concludes:The Vedas look back to a time when the winter solstice, the Path of the Gods ornorthern course of the Sun, began near the beginning of the sign Aries … Thisdoes not mean that the hymns which use such symbolism were all composed duringthis era … It means that the Rig Veda looks back in its mythology to this era asdetermining much of the symbolism of its Gods and the order of its rituals …39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn39]THE ERA OF THE SEVEN SAGESWhy should the Rig look back in time towards such a distant epoch, roughlybetween 7000 and 6000 BC, if it does not have some very real and significantconnection with that epoch?Oddly enough, exactly the same question can be asked of a system of calendricalreckoning still in use in some remote highland parts of India today, notablyKashmir.40 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn40] Described at length inthe Puranas, it is called, suggestively, ‘the Era of the Seven Rishis’.41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn41] Although it operates completelyindependently of the yuga system it does intersect with it at certain pointsand, indeed, it is this very Saptarishi calendar which provides the referentsthat pundits have used to calculate the onset of the Kali Yuga to a date of 3102BC.42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn42]To state a complicated matter briefly, the Saptarishi calendar envisages aseries of revolving cycles, each of 2800 years duration (much shorter than thoseof the yuga system). And while the yuga system has no real beginning or end, theSaptarishi calendar has a definite start date – a very first ‘Era of the SevenRishis’. This start date is 6676 BC.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn43] According to John Mitchiner’sdetailed study:The complete cycle wherein occurs the start of the Kali Yuga will commence withKrittika in 3876 BC … while the preceding complete cycle will commence withKrittika some 2800 years earlier, namely in 6676 BC … and the following completecycle will commence with Krittika in 1076 BC … The date of 6676 BC was in somesense regarded as being a starting point for Indian chronology.44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn44]Mitchiner points out that that there is historical corroboration for aseventh-millennium BC start-point for Indian chronology in the works of Greekand Roman authors. Notable examples are Solinus and Pliny (AD23–79), who said ofthe Indians that from the time of the founding-father of their civilization tothe time of Alexander the Great: ‘they reckon the number of their kings to havebeen 154 and they reckon the time as 6451 years and 3 months’.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn45] Alexander entered the Punjab in326 BC and left in the same year. The implication is that the ‘Father’ figure(associated with Bacchus in the Roman texts) ‘was thought to have reigned inIndia in 64511/4 + 326 = 6777 BC’.46[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn46]Since Pliny and Solinus drew on reports sent back by Rome’s ambassadors toIndia’s Maurya court,47 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn47] theirchronology is regarded as first-hand information and is thought to transmit anaccurate representation of ancient Indian beliefs about the past. Mitchiner istherefore intrigued by the factthat the date of 6777 BC which is given … by Pliny and Solinus is only a singlecentury in advance of the date of 6676 BC which is suggested in the Indian textsto represent the starting point of Indian chronology, as based upon the Era ofthe Seven Rsis. We may therefore conclude that such a date was indeed regarded –from at least the 4th century BC – as being a starting point of Indianchronology.48 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn48]CONNECTIONSI already knew that it was the ancient function of Rishis – Sages, Seers – tosustain the institution of kingship on earth. It was to this end, and in orderto preserve and repromulgate the Vedas, that the Seven Sages were said to havetravelled to the Himalayas with Father Manu in the time of the great flood.Now I also knew that an Indian calendar system identified with the Seven Sages,with a father figure and with a line of kings, had a start date of around 6700BC – a date that fell well within the time-frame of the greatest floods theearth has known in the past 125,000 years.Last but not least, I could not forget that 6700 BC is extremely close to thedate at which the first settlement of the remarkable site of Mehrgarh inBaluchistan took place – a site where the systematic planting and cultivation ofcereals and vegetables, as well as systematic animal husbandry, was apparentlyintroduced into India for the first time.Inevitably I began to wonder if all these things might not in some way beconnected."},{"pageContent":"8 / THE DEMON ON THE MOUNTAIN AND THE REBIRTH OF CIVILIZATIONWhy humans came to domesticate plants and animals at some particular point inhistory remains somewhat of a mystery. It seems to be a phenomenon thatdeveloped just after the opening of the Holocene in several regions of both theOld and New Worlds. Why it did not occur earlier is not known.Professor Gregory Possehl, University of Pennsylvania, 1999Geological record indicates that during Late Pleistocene glaciation, waters ofthe Himalaya were frozen and that in place of rivers there were only glaciers,masses of solid ice … When the climate became warmer, the glaciers began tobreak up and the frozen water held by them surged forth in great floods,inundating the alluvial plain in front of the mountains … No wonder the earlyinhabitants of the plains burst into song praising Lord Indra for breaking upthe glaciers and releasing waters which flowed out in seven mighty channels[Sapta Sindhu). The analogy of a slowly-moving serpent (Ahi) for describing theHimalayan glacier is most appropriate … With the hindsight we possess asgeologists, we at once see that the phenomenon described in the Rig Veda was noidle fancy but a real natural event of great significance connected with thebreak-up of Himalayan glaciers and the release of pent-up waters in greatfloods.B. P. Radhakrishna, Geological Society of India, 1999In its study and interpretation of the past, archaeology depends heavily onmaterial evidence produced at excavations. The dependence becomes total when theculture being investigated has left no documents or inscriptions to tell usabout itself.The Indus-Sarasvati civilization was a literate culture, but the archaeologicalinterpretation of it has been strictly limited to excavated material remains andhas never been able to draw upon the civilization’s own texts. This is becauseall attempts to decipher the enigmatic ‘Harappan’ script have failed, andbecause (at least until very recently) the Sanskrit Vedas were regarded as thework of another, later culture and were assumed to have had nothing to do withthe Indus-Sarasvati civilization. Well into the twentieth century, this approachsimply meant that there was no Indus-Sarasvati civilization. It was not part ofthe archaeological picture of India’s past and was never even contemplated. Itwas, in other words, as ‘lost’ as Plato’s Atlantis until the material evidencethat proved its existence began to surface when excavations were started atHarappa and Mohenjodaro in the 1920s.Many more characteristically ‘Harappan’ sites were discovered during the nexthalf-century of excavations in Pakistan and India but, as luck would have it,none of these were significantly older than Harappa and Mohenjodaro themselves.For a long while, therefore, the prevailing view amongst scholars was that thesegreat cities had sprung up suddenly, with none of the long-term localdevelopment, evolution and growth that would normally be expected to underliesuch a huge leap forward into organized urban life. For some archaeologists thiswas proof that the Indus-Sarasvati civilization was an offshoot of what wasassumed to be the much older civilization of Sumer in Mesopotamia. Others justtook it as an enigma and preferred to get on with the more practical business ofunderstanding the evidence in hand.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_037_r1.jpg]The breakthrough came with the start of excavations at ‘the village farmingcommunity’ of Mehrgarh in Baluchistan in 1974. Now joined by Nausharo and anumber of other equally ancient sites, its earliest settlement layers are datedto around 7000 BC. TWO things are particularly striking about Mehrgarh: (1) fromthe very beginning its people were efficient and productive farmers; and (2)invaluably for archaeology, the site remained continuously inhabited until aslate as the first millennium BC.Moreover, many sites of intermediate age, between Mehrgarh in 7000 BC andHarappa around 2500 BC, have also subsequently been found in the ever-wideningIndus-Sarasvati catchment area – and all of them are now regarded byarchaeologists as the direct antecedents, represented at various stages of anentirely normal and reassuringly gradual process of evolutionary development, ofthe Indus-Sarasvati civilization itself.This is often lauded as an example of how archaeologists are open to new factsand at the same time as proof that if you dig deep enough and far enough afieldyou will sooner or later expose a lengthy phase of evolution behind any highlydeveloped civilization. In other words, great cities with a mature and efficientagricultural base don’t spring out of nowhere, ever. They may seem to, for awhile; but in the end they always turn out to have a background.Professor S. P. Gupta of the National Museum Institute in New Delhi provides auseful summary of current archaeological thinking on the origins of theIndus-Sarasvati civilization:It is common knowledge that the history of Indian civilization begins in theNeolithic cultures of the north-western hills and the piedmont regions datingback to the late eighth millennium BC at sites like Mehrgarh on the Bolan Riverin Baluchistan. Unfortunately … Mehrgarh … was not put to excavation [until]1974 … However, after the excavations conducted at Mehrgarh our entireperspective of the hill cultures of Baluchistan, hence about the beginning ofthe Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, has undergone a sea-change.We now no longer talk of Baluchistan either in terms of a ‘corridor’ throughwhich Iranian or Turanian1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn1]cultures passed on their way to the Indus Valley and caused the Indus-SarasvatiCivilization, or in terms of a rugged mountainous region with ‘as many culturesas there are now hills’. Instead, we now see the hills and sub-mountainousregions of Baluchistan as the ‘nuclear zone’ which gave birth to a very longsuccession of cultures starting from the aceramic Neolithic, datable to the 8thmillennium BC, to the beginning of the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization in the mid4th millennium BC In other words, what was once thought … to be a loose chain ofautonomous Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures inspired by Iranian cultures cannow be seen as parts of well-integrated cultural systems operating on aninterregional basis all along the sub-mountainous regions, skirted by theKirthar and Suleiman mountains, and the basins of the Indus, Ravi, Chenab,Satluj and the Sarasvati along with their tributaries. It is this system whicheventually gave birth to the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization in the plains of theIndus and the Sarasvati.2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn2]WHAT ARCHAEOLOGY KNOWSSo let’s be clear about the mainstream archaeological position today: 1. The ‘nuclear zone’ out of which the Indus-Sarasvati civilization emerged was the ‘submontane’ or ‘piedmont’ region in the foothills of the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalayan mountain ranges. 2. This ‘first stirring’ of what was ultimately to become the largest urban culture of the ancient world, took place around the end of the eighth millennium BC and the beginning of the seventh. 3. The earliest surviving and most complete site so far found that bears witness to it is Mehrgarh in the Bolan pass, which dates to around 7000 BC. 4. Since Mehrgarh, the story of the evolution and development of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization is well known, with close to 3000 sites excavated. It is therefore extremely unlikely that any more major surprises await archaeologists researching the 5000-year period from 7000 BC down to 2000 BC.I feel it is important to stress that all these points represent entirelyreasonable deductions from the evidence now to hand and that the orthodoxscholarly picture of the origins and development of civilization in India sincethe time of Mehrgarh is likely to be correct – not only in broad outline butalso in most of its finer details. In the absence of texts there will certainlybe some aspects of the process that have been misunderstood or not evenrecognized – particularly matters to do with religious or symbolic expression –but there is no doubt that the archaeologists (these days mostly indigenousteams from India and Pakistan) have done diligent and extensive work and that byand large they have got the chronology and the connections right.WHAT ARCHAEOLOGY DOESN’T KNOWThe same cannot be said of the period before Mehrgarh, as the scrupulouslyhonest Gregory Possehl informs us:Almost nothing is known of the time between the late Glacial Age at circa 15,000BC and the beginnings of Mehrgarh at circa 7000 BC … The first period atMehrgarh has fully-developed domestic architecture based on mud brick … So whileMehrgarh … is undoubtedly an early village farming community, there is also asense that the excavations there have not documented the beginnings of thistradition or the beginnings of food production and domestication in the region.It is certainly nothing like a terminal hunting-gathering site with theintensive collection of cereals, pulses and sophisticated hunting. These peoplewere already farmers.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn3]Quite a mystery, in my view!Possehl explains the ‘sudden’ appearance of this strangely sophisticated villagefarming community at Mehrgarh as an artefact of incomplete excavations and isconfident that ‘the beginnings of food production and domestication in theregion’ will eventually be traced – within the region itself.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn4] Also he relates the level ofdevelopment that archaeologists have exposed in the first period of Mehrgarh,c.7000 BC, to that of so-called PPNB (‘Pre-Pottery Neolithic “B”’) sites in theLevant. The PPNB represents the period between 8600BC and 7000 BC, when farmingeconomies first came to dominate the Levant and southeast Anatolia (though thereis highly localized evidence of agriculture in the Levant a thousand yearsbefore that).5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn5] Possehl is careful,however, not to imply any causal connection or influence in one direction or theother and admits:Why humans came to domesticate plants and animals at some particular point inhistory remains somewhat of a mystery. It seems to be a phenomenon thatdeveloped just after the opening of the Holocene in several regions of both theOld and New Worlds. Why it did not occur earlier is not known.6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn6]Why, in other words, did the shift to food production and domestication happensuddenly and specifically then – after 12,000 years ago (the date thatgeologists have set as the end of the ‘Pleistocene’ glacial age and thebeginning of the modern ‘Holocene’) rather than at some other time? This isprecisely the moment, Possehl observes, ‘near the beginning of the Holocene,following the retreat of the last great continental glaciers’ that the ‘originsof settled life in the northwestern sector of southern Asia can be documented’.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn7]We are entering here one of the truly great riddles of prehistory: not just whydid humans begin to domesticate plants and animals at a particular moment in theIndian subcontinent, but why did they do so in the first place anywhere in theworld – and when and where (if anywhere) did this process really begin?There have been many attempts to understand the driving forces behind thefood-producing and domestication revolution in human history:8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn8]Propinquity, overpopulation, cultural readiness, systems feedback, climaticchange and stress, population pressure, even a kind of historical inevitabilityhave all been offered, acting alone or in concert with other forces, to explainthis revolution.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn9]By the mid-1990s the abrupt climate changes at the Pleistocene/Holocene boundarythat accompanied the end of the Ice Age were becoming a focus of specialinterest to quite a number of researchers interested in the origins ofagriculture.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn10] McCorriston andHole (1991) and Bar-Yoseph and Meadow (1995) were amongst many to argue that:The origins of agriculture must be viewed in the context of a fluctuatingclimatic regime that broadened and then constricted areas suitable forproductive hunting and gathering and later for cultivation and pastoralism …abrupt climate shifts are seen as triggers.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn11]The counter-argument to this position offered by Gregory Possehl in 1999 ispersuasive and worth hearing in detail:Those who use the ‘short-term climatic trigger’ hypothesis are essentiallyproposing that … when the climate reduced resources, there was only room for oneresponse: food production with domestication. That may have been a possibility,but there must have been other conceivable reactions to such climatic stress:e.g. migration (probably only partial) to other environments, broadening theadaptation to include plants and animals not already part of the subsistenceregime, population reduction, some combination or partial implementation ofthese solutions.The San !Kung bushmen seem to have lived through a three-year drought inBotswana and hardly noticed it. Neighbouring Bantu-speaking pastoralist-farmerslost 100,000 cattle, and food for 200,000 farmers and herders had to be broughtin as relief. In fact, the hunter-gatherers are reported to have helped theBantus who came into their area to gather. We learn from this that the humanresponse to drought and natural adversity is difficult to predict. Thehunting-gathering adaptation can be extraordinarily resilient and provide verydeep, very reliable insulation against adversities of nature.We should not imagine that the relationship between humans and the natural worldinvolves such unsophisticated responses as those proposed by the climatic andenvironmental stress models. The notion that early Holocene hunting andgathering populations … were just fine until the weather turned bad and thatthis caused them to domesticate plants and animals is just too simple …Moreover, placing the burden of the final shift to food production on adeteriorating climate relies on the notion that the people who ‘inventedagriculture’ were under stress and impoverished.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn12]WHAT THE VEDIC SAGES KNEW (1): FLOOD SURVIVORSIn summary, isn’t it much more likely that ‘the people who invented agriculture’would have been part of a society with the means and time to undertake whatscholars have described as ‘the leisurely process of domestication’, rather thanpeople on the brink of starvation?13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn13] Such a scenario, at the veryleast, seems to offer an alternative explanation for why the inhabitants ofMehrgarh were already farmers when the first bricks were laid there 9000 yearsago: either, as Possehl suggests, they evolved their food-producing skills inthe submontane belt around the foothills of the Karakorams and the Himalayasearlier than 9000 years ago. In this case we must suppose, as he does, that thetraces of this vital evolutionary phase – between sophisticated hunter-gatheringon the one hand, and full-scale agriculture and livestock management on theother – still await discovery (despite the admittedly intense archaeologicalinvestigation of these areas during the past fifty years); or, they evolvedtheir skills somewhere else, in the Levant or another place where archaeologistshave not looked, and migrated into the submontane regions of north-west Indiafrom there.Oddly enough, it is the second possibility, not the first, that is favoured bythe ancient traditions of India itself. We’ve seen how these explain that Manuand the Seven Sages retreated to the Himalayas from a place that was not theHimalayas at the time of a terrible oceanic flood, and that they brought withthem from their antediluvian homeland not only the Vedas but also all the‘seeds’ that would be necessary to re-establish permanent food-producingsettlements.The sacred texts also tell us that Vedic society was guided by a brotherhood ofthese Seven Sages – Rishis, wise men – who oversaw its evolution, establishedthe institution of kingship within it for the general benefit of mankind, andensured that those kings ruled justly. The fundamental ethic taught by the sageswas asceticism – which is indeed the eternal ethic of ancient India for as farback as the memory of man extends – and while recognizing the necessity of asociety that could meet all the basic material needs of human beings, it isunlikely that the ‘economic policies’ of such sages would ever have encouragedoverproduction or the growth of luxury.A relatively simple lifestyle, with few material preoccupations and a focus onspirituality and yogic self-discipline would be more along the lines of whatwould be expected – a lifestyle very much like that of Mehrgarh 9000 years agoat the end of the Ice Age.MEHRGARH’S STORYThe Bolan pass connects the western side of the Indus valley with the highlandsof Baluchistan and beyond. Mehrgarh nestles at the foot of the pass on thealluvial Kachi plains beside the Bolan river. It is a well-chosen spot:sheltered location; plenty of water; good for agriculture; and good as a transitpoint for any trade or travel that is going on between the mountains on one sideand the lowlands and the Arabian Sea on the other. Mehrgarh is far enough fromthe coast – about 500 kilometres – to have been safe from oceanic inundation(still an issue 9000 years ago with one further major episode of globalsuperfloods yet to come). Moreover, although rugged, Baluchistan is not highenough to have supported an ice-cap during the last glaciation. Other thanoccasional unavoidable flooding of the Bolan river, we may therefore speculatethat Mehrgarh would have enjoyed a moderate climate threatened by no obviousenvironmental or geological hazards when it was founded around 9000 years ago.So it’s easy to see why those first inhabitants – who were already farmers andclearly knew a thing or two about agricultural land – chose to settle atMehrgarh rather than somewhere else. What is not so clear is whether there wasany special motive or purpose or plan or inspiration behind the settlement orwhether it is just to be seen the way scholars usually portray it – i.e. as partof some general, haphazard ‘trend’ towards sedentarization and intensified foodproduction in north-west India that had in some vague way been prompted byclimate change.Mehrgarh is extensive, running north to south along the west bank of the Bolanriver in a strip up to a kilometre wide and more than two kilometres long –although not all sectors were occupied at the same time. The Period 1 materialis clustered towards the northern end of the site, where it is estimated tocover an area of approximately 3–4 hectares. Of this only a very smallproportion (75 square metres) has as yet been excavated.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn14]One of the several things about Mehrgarh that I find puzzling, given thegenerally high level of development and discipline shown by its people from thebeginning, is that the first settlers either did not know how to make pottery,or for some inexplicable reason chose not to use it. At any rate no pottery hasbeen found in the earliest occupation layer (Period 1A) dated to around 9000years ago; it begins to show up in Period 1B, about a thousand years later.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn15]This ‘aceramic’ phase suggests that Mehrgarh’s first inhabitants must have beenrelatively unsophisticated; however, other evidence – notably concerning theircompetence as builders – contradicts this view. From the outset, for example,they built with well-made mud bricks of regular size (33 × 14.5 × 7centimetres)16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn16] and orientedcertain structures to the cardinal directions.17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn17] Many of the structures are simpledwellings with relatively strong walls made out of two courses of bricks laidside by side and with floors on which the ancient impressions of reeds cansometimes still be made out. The average size of these dwellings is small, just5 by 4 metres, and yet they are frequently subdivided into several smallrooms:18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn18][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_038_r1.jpg]Plan of Compartmented buildings at Mehrgarh. Based on Rao (1991)Ovens and hearths … were usually found in the corners of rooms and signs oftheir use can be seen as traces of smoke on the plastered walls. One circularoven was lined with bricks and had a dome [like the tandoor ovens of Pakistanand northern India today] which was traced in its collapsed condition.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn19]Some of the Mehrgarh structures bear a striking family resemblance to much laterbuildings of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization – notably the so-called ‘Granary’of Mohenjodaro, which has numerous narrow, cell-like compartments and has beeninterpreted as a storage facility.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn20] The same interpretation has beengiven by the French archaeological team to ‘Structure B’ at Mehrgarh, whichmeasures:6.3 metres by 6.7 metres, is oriented north-south, and is made up of sixrectangular rooms. Three rooms measure 2.25 metres by 1.5 metres and the otherthree 3.3 metres by 1.5 metres. No doorways between rooms were found even thoughthere are two, three or four preserved courses of bricks. The walls were made oftwo rows of bricks … The floors of five of the rooms were covered with pebbles(three rooms were completely covered with them).21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn21]There are traces of many other compartmented structures at Mehrgarh from severalsuccessive periods in the life of the town. Some of them are preserved up to aheight of more than 15 courses of bricks and in none of them have doors orwindows been found. The cell units are often no larger than 1 square metre andit is presumed that they must have been entered through their roofs.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn22][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_039_r1.jpg]Diagram of cell units at Mehrgarh. Based on Quivron (1991).So, although they did not make pottery, the very first inhabitants of Mehrgarhdid make a range of brick buildings – and these look like the work of people whoknew what they were doing. The compartmented structures may not have been‘granaries’ – there’s no definite evidence – but, whatever they were, theyclearly had a function and were built according to some sort of protocol. Such aprotocol must, logically, have antedated the foundation of Mehrgarh in order tofeature in an already developed form in the oldest habitation layers there.The first people of Mehrgarh were accomplished farmers, from the beginning, asGregory Possehl has pointed out. They grew domesticated wheat and barley, stilltwo of the principal food grains of northern India today.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn23] In their suite of crops they alsoincluded other carefully chosen domesticates: lentils, peas and chickpeas:The pulses, annual legumes cultivated for their seed, are an especiallyinteresting group of plants because they are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen insymbiosis with the bacterium Rhizobium found on their roots. They add nitrogento the soil, rather than consume it, and if these plants are rotated and mixedwith the food grains, higher yields are achieved through increased soilfertility.24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn24]Because agricultural knowledge like this ought to take centuries, maybemillennia, to build up, Gregory Possehl is not alone amongst archaeologists inhis conviction that Mehrgarh does not represent the beginnings of thefood-producing tradition in north India but an already developed stage of it.There is also evidence that the domestication of wild species of goats, sheepand cattle was undertaken by Mehrgarh’s first settlers, with great success, asthough this was something else that they already understood how to do fromexperience that they had acquired in another location. Moreover, they seem tohave arrived at Mehrgarh with this animal-domestication programme already inmind and in the initial years supplemented their diet with hunting on the Kachiplains (gazelle, swamp-deer, blackbuck, wild pig, elephant, etc.) while thedevelopment of their domesticated herds was underway. ‘What we see at Mehrgarh,’concludes Possehl,is a sequence of events that seems to document the local domestication ofanimals. The sheep, goats and cattle start out looking wild, and weremanipulated … Over time the potential domesticates came to look likedomesticated animals (smaller, with the osteological hallmarks of domesticatedbeasts) … The contribution of domestic or ‘pro-domestic’ stock to the faunalassemblages came to surpass that of other animals early in the aceramic.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn25]I note in passing that the food-production sequences that archaeologists havebeen able to piece together at Mehrgarh show a good level of fit with the Manustory – which, unlike the Noah story, says nothing about animals on the Ark, butwhich does tell us that the archetypal Indian flood survivor brought on board,‘carefully preserved and assorted, all the seeds which have been described ofold’.26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn26]Other materials excavated at Mehrgarh add to our understanding of its firstsettlers: they used small amounts of copper ‘thought to be of the nativevariety, not smelted’; their primary tools, fashioned from flint, include sickleblades bearing the characteristic sheen imparted when such blades are used toharvest crops; they wove textiles; they made baskets, sometimes waterproofingthem with bitumen; they fashioned awls, spatulas and needles from bone; theyalso possessed a well-developed bead-making industry producing tiny disc-shapedbeads in black steatite, barrel-shaped beads in calcite and bangles of polishedconch shell;27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn27] Dentalium shells –long, hollow tubes that form natural beads – have likewise been found inMehrgarh. These shells are endemic to the Gulf of Cambay.28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn28] There is also evidence of contactwith coastal areas ‘and long distance trade networks as attested by the presenceof marine shells, lapis lazuli, and turquoise in even the earliest graves’.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn29]Mention of these earliest graves raises another mystery that surrounds the firstinhabitants and founders of Mehrgarh. Unlike later occupants of the site, theyburied their dead with great care and ceremony. The bodies were carefullyarranged in a ‘flexed’ or embryonic posture, oriented with the head towards theeast and the feet towards the west,30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn30] surrounded by personal effectsand sometimes by offerings of food and drink for sustenance on what was clearlybelieved to be some form of afterlife journey of the soul.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn31] Such burials – 166 graves intotal – began right at the start of aceramic Period 1A and were sustained overmore than a thousand years down to Period 11A before gradually beingabandoned.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn32] A particularlyinteresting ‘side-wall’ grave from Period IB contained the remains of an adultmale or femalealongside a very eroded wall. At the feet were a polished stone axe, a largeflint core, a piece of a red ochre lump, a bovine bone, and two fragments of adouble-pointed bone tool, a third fragment of which lay in front of the thoraxand provides evidence for the intentional breaking of the tool before burial.Also associated were two turquoise beads (as a belt) and other bovine bonefragments.33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn33]Ritual burials of this nature, with more or less elaborate grave goods, wereconducted again and again in the early years of Mehrgarh. The practice is firmlyestablished at the beginning, with a number of distinct conventions in placeconcerning the style and orientation of the grave and the types of objects andornaments interred with the deceased. All of this suggests a complex religiousand funerary culture – one that must already have been in use by Mehrgarh’sfirst inhabitants when they established the site.But in use for how long? And where? Where did the mature religion with afterlifebeliefs that we get a glimpse of at Mehrgarh 9000 years ago have its origins?Although most archaeologists consider the origins of Indian agriculture to lieeither in the Near East or in the sub-Himalayan piedmont region, there is onediscordant observation about the first settlers which raises doubt. Although theobservation was published in 1983 in the peer-reviewed journal CurrentAnthropology, and although its validity has not been challenged by any of thearchaeologists working at Mehrgarh, it seems that no scholar has yet got fullyto grips with what it could mean.The observation, arising from research conducted by dental morphology specialistJohn Luckacs, concerns ‘the high frequency of shovel-shaped incisors among theinhabitants of Mehrgarh Period I. This is a distinctive feature of populationsof eastern and southeastern Asia.’34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn34] According to Luckacs, the teethof the Period I inhabitants of Mehrgarhcontrast strongly with the European dental complex [generally found in India andin the neighbourhood of Mehrgarh from antiquity] and share several dentalfeatures common with the Sundadont pattern … The Neolithic people of Mehrgarhmay represent the western margin of South-Southeast Asian phenotypic dentalpattern known as Sundadont.35 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn35]Though passed off in a low-key manner, the implications of this discovery areactually quite extraordinary – since the way overland from south-east Asia tonorth-west India is very long indeed and since the Sundadont characteristicsfound at Mehrgarh have never been observed anywhere else in the subcontinent.36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn36] Moreover, south-east Asia’sextensive Sunda Shelf – the home of Sundadont teeth and a continent-sizedlandmass above water at the Last Glacial Maximum – was submerged in severalrapid stages between 16,000 and 11,000 years ago.The implications seem obvious at first, i.e. that forced out of their originalhomes (where they had established agriculture, religion, etc.) by the floodingof the Sunda Shelf, the first settlers somehow sailed all the way from southeastAsia to the north-west coast of India then sailed up the Indus and then finallycrossed overland to the foot of the Bolan pass, where they founded Mehrgarh. Yetthe teeth don’t warrant such a large conclusion. They are not pure Sundadont butrather ‘share several dental features in common with the Sundadont pattern’ andare more likely to have come from some intermediate place – though where thatmight have been cannot be guessed from the dental evidence alone.Besides, if flooding is to be cited as the reason why settlers – hypothetically– would have left the Sunda Shelf and sailed to India, then why do we need tolook so far afield when we have half a million square kilometres of good land tothe north, south and east of Gujerat that was inundated during the same period?Aren’t hypothetical flood refugees much more likely to have reached Mehrgarhfrom there, less than a thousand kilometres away, than from distant Indonesia orMalaysia on the Sunda Shelf?At the very least, the similarities to the Sundadont pattern seen in the teethof Mehrgarh’s Period I people do seem to rule out any possibility that they hadmigrated to Mehrgarh overland from the west. As Jonathan Kennoyer confirms:They do not have strong morphological relationships to known Neolithicpopulations of West Asia. On the contrary their dental morphology associatesthem with a distinctively Asian gene pool.37[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn37]The mystery of who exactly it was who founded Mehrgarh therefore remainsunsolved to this day, and the whole issue has been somewhat neglected – perhapsbecause of its potential to cause controversy. Scholars also continue to have noidea as to what it was that brought the settlers to Mehrgarh in the first place,though they seem to have arrived with a definite plan and purpose in mind. Lastbut not least, we should not draw conclusions about the state of mental andintellectual development of the first inhabitants from the rather simple andaustere nature of their homes, their tools and their lifestyle. This‘archaeological assemblage’ is consistent with the orthodox historical model ofhow people at the threshold of sedentarized food production should have lookedand behaved when they set up their first permanent settlements.38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn38] But Mehrgarh is also consistentwith another model – the model that is suggested in the Rig Veda of a societyestablished by yogic sages to meet simple needs with great efficiency, butshowing no interest in material luxuries or excesses that might lure humans awayfrom the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and the immortal destiny of thesoul.RISING SEAS AND MELTING ICE-CAPSMehrgarh Period I takes us back to about 9000 years ago, but the radiocarbonresults are frequently confusing,39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn39] ‘the stratigraphy at the site isextremely complex’,40 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn40] and becauseof the margins of inaccuracy that apply to any attempt to date sites as old asthis one it is by no means inconceivable that Mehrgarh may in fact be closer to10,000 than to 9000 years old.41 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn41]I decided to find out more about what had been happening in the northwesternHimalayas in the millennia leading up to the foundation of Mehrgarh, during thecatastrophic meltdown at the end of the last Ice Age. It was at this time,immediately following ‘the retreat of the last great continental glaciers’, asPossehl puts it, that the food-producing explosion began in north-west India.But strangely neither he nor any other major scholar looking at therevolutionary cultural developments of that epoch has considered the possibilitythat the melting glaciers and rising sea-levels were more than just symptoms ofgeneralized climate change and might in some way have been directly connected tothe introduction at Mehrgarh of a settled agricultural way of life that wasapparently new to the subcontinent.We’ve already seen how dramatically India’s coasts were inundated after 15,000years ago. But what about the ‘supply’ end of the rising sea-level equation?What about the ice-caps, in runaway meltdown as glaciers collapsed, that senthuge floods roaring down from the mountains to fill up the oceans? If there werecataclysmic outburst floods from glacial lakes in North America and in Europe,then why not in the Himalayas too?DOUBLE MEANINGSThe language of the Rig Veda, even after its passage from a spoken, oraltradition to a written Sankrit tradition, and after its more recenttransformation from ancient Sanskrit into modern and often prosaic English,remains intensely mysterious – filled with symbols, metaphors and riddles thatsometimes seem to have been designed to blur the borderline between image andreality, between the symbol and the thing symbolized.A small but possibly significant example of this concerns the use of certainSanskrit words in the Manu story with what can only have been the deliberateintention of exploiting ambiguities and innuendoes in their meaning. This issurely the case, argues David Frawley, with the Vedic word for ‘boat’ – nau –which also means ‘word’ or ‘Divine Word’, while the word for ‘thought’, dhi,also means ‘vessel’.42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn42] Such punscould offer a rational explanation for the improbable image of a ship maroonedin the Himalayas that the Manu story leaves us with. For example, although thewords used speak literally of a ship attached to the peak of a high snow-coveredmountain, the relevant passages could very easily have been intended to suggestthat the ‘word’ – the revealed ‘Divine Word’, i.e., the Vedas themselves – hadbeen brought to the Himalayas for safekeeping in the memories of the SevenSages. That would make sense of the caution supposedly given to the refugees byVishnu that the ‘ship/word’ should not be allowed to descend from the mountainstoo fast lest the waters sweep it away. Perhaps the community of Sages that ishinted at in the texts decided to stay for a long time in retreat in theHimalayas, perhaps even for many generations, storing and preserving the seedsof already domesticated varieties of cereals and pulses that they had broughtfrom their homeland until such a moment as they felt it was safe for the ‘Word’once again to be promulgated amongst men. In this case we should read the termNaubandhana in the Mahabaratha (see chapter 6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06]) not as so much as ‘the place of thebinding of the ship’ but as ‘the place of the protection of the Word’.Another interesting area of ambiguity concerns the many shades of meaning thathave been found in the name of the Sarasvati river. Possehl renders it ‘Chain ofPools’, Frawley reads it as ‘She who flows’.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn43] Griffith’s authoritativetranslation, on the other hand, is ‘The Watery’.44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn44]What therefore are we to make of one of the most ambiguous and symbolic ideasthat the Vedas have to offer: the great myth known as ‘the Freeing of the SevenRivers’ that seems to speak of a flood cataclysm in the Himalayas?WHAT THE VEDIC SAGES KNEW (2): THE MELTDOWN IN THE HIMALAYASThe Rig Veda conjures up a compelling image of a demon in the form of a greatdragon, or serpent, that has wrapped itself around the ice-covered mountainranges that hem in northern India and strangled seven great rivers. The name ofthe demon is sometimes Ahi but more often Vrtra and the story of how he is slainby the god Indra and of how the seven rivers are freed, is repeated again andagain in the hymns of the Rig Veda:I will declare the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he achieved, theThunder-wielder. He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft thechannels of the mountain torrents. He slew the Dragon lying on the mountain; hisheavenly bolt of thunder Tvastr [the artificer of the gods] fashioned. Likelowing kine in rapid flow descending, the waters glided downward to the ocean …Indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces Vrtra … There helies like a bank-bursting river, the waters taking courage flow above him. TheDragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which Vrtra with his greatness hadencompassed … Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without arest for ever onward, the waters bear off Vrtra’s nameless body … O Indra … thouhast let loose to flow the Seven Rivers. (1, 32, 1–12)Indra hath hurled down the magician Vrtra who lay beleaguering the mighty river.Then both the heaven and earth trembled in terror at the strong Hero’s thunderwhen he bellowed. (2, 11, 9)Thou, slaying Ahi, settest free the river’s path. (2, 13, 5)Indra, whose hand wields thunder, rent piecemeal Ahi who barred up the waters,So that the quickening currents of the rivers flowed … Indra, this Mighty One,the Dragon’s Slayer, sent forth the flood of waters to the ocean. (2, 19, 2–3)Thou in thy vigour having slaughtered Vrtra didst free the floods arrested bythe Dragon. Heaven trembled at the birth of thine effulgence; Earth trembled atthe fear of thy displeasure. The steadfast mountains shook in agitation: thewaters flowed and desert spots were flooded. (4, 17, 1–3)Thou slewest Ahi who besieged the waters … the insatiate one, extended, hard towaken, who slumbered in perpetual sleep, O Indra. The Dragon stretched againstthe seven prone rivers, where no joint was, thou rentest with thy thunder. (4,19, 2–3)Indra for man made waters flow together, slew Ahi and sent forth the SevenRivers, and opened as it were obstructed fountains. (4, 28, 1)E’en now endures thine exploit of the Rivers, when, Indra, for their floods thouclavest passage. Like men who sit at meat the mountains settled. (6, 30, 3)Indra … ye slew the flood-obstructing serpent Vrtra … Heaven approved thineexploit. Ye urged to speed the currents of the rivers, and many seas have yefilled full with waters. (6, 72, 3)A common explanation that is offered for this myth, both by foreign scholars andby the Indian commentators, sees Vrtra as a symbol for large, dark rain-cloudswhich Indra bursts open with his thunderbolt. The rivers in this scenario aresaid to symbolize ‘streams of rain’.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn45] Thus Horace Wilson writes:the original purpose of the legend of Indra’s slaying of Vrtra … is merely anallegorical narrative of the production of rain. Vrtra … is nothing more thanthe accumulation of vapour condensed or figuratively shut up in, or obstructedby a cloud. Indra, with his thunderbolt, or atmospheric or electrical influence,divides the aggregated mass, and vent is given to the rain which then descendsupon the earth.46 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn46]It is true that some descriptions of Vrtra in the Rig Veda do unambiguouslydepict the demon as a withholder of rain (‘the rain obstructor’, 1, 52, 6) andequally clearly associate his destruction with the onset of ‘floods of rain’ (1,56, 5) – so any attempt to assess Vrtra’s character must take such descriptionsinto account. Nevertheless, I do not feel that Wilson’s elegant allegorysatisfactorily explains certain key features of the myth outlined in thepassages cited above: the constant references to the ‘freeing of the SevenRivers’ (if ‘rivers’ are really ‘streams of rain’, then why are there just sevenof them?); the description of pieces of Vrtra’s body being carried away in thewaters, ‘rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents’ (surely more consistentwith what is seen during powerful floods than it is with rainstorms?); the clearstatement that the released waters cut channels in the mountains and descend inrapid flow to the oceans; the way that the flooding of ‘desert spots’ isconnected to this downrush of waters from the mountains; and most of all the waythat the released waters are said to flow ‘above’ the Dragon Vrtra as he liesabased ‘beneath the feet of torrents’ (whereas, if he were merely a rain-clouddispersed by Indra’s thunderbolt, one would have expected what was left of his‘body’ – the remaining wisps of cloud? – to have been above the freed waters,not beneath them).Uncomfortable with Wilson’s pure symbolism for precisely these reasons, otherscholars have offered a more literal interpretation of the myth in which therivers are the seven physical rivers of ancient north-west India – an area thatis indeed referred to as early as the Rig Veda as the ‘Land of the SevenRivers’.47 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn47] The rivers concernedare generally presumed to be the Indus, the Sarasvati and the five rivers of thePunjab48 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn48] which ‘often entirelydried up in the summer’.49 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn49]According to this variant, Indra is ‘the god of the rainy season’ who calls therivers back to life and Vrtra is the demon of summer drought.50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn50]But there are problems here too. Most significantly, Indra’s ‘exploit of theRivers’ is not portrayed in the Rig Veda as an annually or seasonally recurringevent but as a one-off, unrepeatable event of awe-inspiring proportions thattook place a long time ago (so long ago it is described as Indra’s first manlydeed and the poet remarks with wonder that ‘e’en now’ its fame endures). When Iread the accounts in the Rig I find it impossible to convince myself that thesages of remote antiquity who composed these hymns were talking about somethingthat happened every year when they described this epic conflict that took placein the snow-covered northern mountain ranges. On the contrary, the texts leaveno doubt that when Vrtra was slain he was slain for ever: ‘When Indra and theDragon strove in battle, Maghavan [“Lord of Bounty”, an epithet for Indra]gained the victory for ever’ (1, 32, 13).So I think there’s room for a third scenario – one that the scholars haven’tlooked at.ICE DRAGONSuppose that Vrtra symbolizes glaciation – more specifically the Himalayanice-cap, which would have been greatly extended at the Last Glacial Maximum andmight indeed at times have choked off the headwaters of the Seven Rivers. If so,then it can be seen that the myth is quite consistent with the tumultuouscollapse of ice-caps all around the world at the end of the Ice Age – and withwhat one might have expected to witness in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountainsat this time: * Before the heroic intervention of Indra, the demon Ahi in his lair high in the mountains is explicitly described as being ‘extended’ and ‘stretched against the seven prone rivers’ and also as being locked in a ‘perpetual slumber’ – a suitable metaphor for an ice-cap in deep-freeze. * Indra’s slaying of Ahi/Vrtra is compared to the sudden opening of obstructed fountains. * The floods pouring down off the mountains are incredibly strong – strong enough to cleave rocks and ridges asunder as they carve out their paths. * Large chunks of the central dome of the ice-cap get flushed out with the powerful onrushing floods (‘Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward, the waters bear off Vrtra’s nameless body’). * Filled with jostling icebergs, the waters are turbulent and noisy, like stampeding herds of cattle, as they foam out of the rocky gorges and rush towards the ocean. * The dramatic effects of the meltdown include tremendous descending waves (‘glacier waves’, see chapter 3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03]) that form in the vast pools of meltwater on the surfaces of large glaciers (‘There he lies like a bank-bursting river, the waters taking courage flow above him. The Dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents’). * Gigantic earthquakes are unleashed as the burden imposed by the ice-cap on the land beneath is suddenly reduced; in the Himalayas and Kara-korams, which are anyway amongst the fastest-rising regions on earth, such isostatic rebound might have been amplified by normal mountain-building processes (‘the steadfast mountains shook in agitation’). * Distant desert areas far downstream are flooded. * The floods are of a nature to fill ‘many seas’. * After the catastrophic events that denuded the Himalayas and the Kara-korams of much of their Pleistocene ice-cover and that perhaps left them looking very much as they do today, the Seven Rivers that previously had been dammed up or frozen at their headwaters by the expansion of the ice-cap were set free and began to flow again in their normal courses.Plausible? Some of it, perhaps. But this is one of the problems with the game ofinterpreting myth: the meaning ascribed may be more in the eye of the beholderthan anywhere else …Still, after reviewing the whole Vrtra mystery, I thought it made sense to lookmore closely into the scientific literature about the Himalayas. What did thepalaeoclimatologists say had been happening there during the 10,000 years afterthe end of the Last Glacial Maximum when every other ice-covered area in theworld, as far afield as New Guinea, the Andes, North America and northernEurope, was simultaneously experiencing the danger and the drama – but also thepromise for a better future for mankind – of a ferocious meltdown?FLYING THROUGH ELA LANDScientists studying ice-caps and glaciers make much use of the acronym ELA,which stands for Equilibrium Line Altitude, ‘the altitude on a glacier at whichannual accumulation [of ice] is exactly matched by annual ablation [melting], sothat the net mass balance is zero’.51[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn51] As one might expect, numerousstudies have confirmed that ELAs across the Himalayan and Karakoram mountainswere significantly lower at the Last Glacial Maximum than they are today (i.e.the ice-coverage descended further into the valleys and the ice-cap wastherefore deeper – although opinions differ somewhat as to exactly how muchdeeper). A few examples from the literature are sufficient to illustrate theconsensus on this matter:It is evident that there is still considerable room for disagreement on theglacial succession in the north-west Himalaya and Karakoram, and even on thedetails of the events during the last Pleistocene glaciation. This isillustrated by the continuing divergence of opinion on the ELA depression duringthe Last Glacial Maximum, the maximum (of Haserodt) being 1250 metres and theminimum (of Scott) being 720 metres … Despite the apparent diversity in theestimates of ELA-depression-values for the Last Glacial Maximum, values for thenorth-west Himalaya, Greater Karakoram and Swat Kohistan tend to cluster in therange 800–1000 metres.52 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn52]For the Dunde ice cap on the northern flank of Tibet … we have interpreted atemperature decrease of four to six degrees Centigrade and consequent loweringof equilibrium line altitude (ELA) in the range of 700–850 metres during thelast glacial stage.53 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn53]Estimated maximum depressions of ELAs range from approximately 1100 metres belowpresent values (Swat Kohistan and the Hunza Valley in the Karakoram range) to600 metres (southern side of the Zanskar range).54[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn54]Depressions of ELA were calculated from glacial geological mapping of the formerextent of the glaciers. Maximum ELA depressions were 700 metres below presentvalues in the Ningle Valley, 750 metres in the Liddar Valley, and 800 metres inthe Sind Valley.55 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn55]ELAs were reconstructed for the Last Glacial Maximum advance … The results showan ELA depression of approximately 1000 metres below present values in theLadakh range.56 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn56]One would not go far wrong by saying that the average lowering of ELA over theHimalayan/Karakoram ice-cap at the Last Glacial Maximum was probably of theorder of 750 metres – i.e. about three-quarters of a kilometre.Now what does this mean in practical terms? Writing in Science, NicholasBorozovic, Douglas Burbank and Andrew Meigs helpfully provide an answer to thisquestion with special reference to the north-western Himalayas and theKarakorams at the Last Glacial Maximum:[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_040_r1.jpg]small changes in ELA significantly increase the percent surface area covered byglaciers when the region lies at an altitude similar to the EL A … For deeplyincised mountainous regions (Nanga Parbat, the Karakoram, and Haramosh andRakaposhi] there is an approximately linear relation between ELA lowering andthe area above the snowline. Modern-day glaciers in the Karakoram are extensive;conditions at the LGM would have nearly doubled the area above the snowlineavailable for their accumulation areas. For the Nanga Parbat and Haramosh andRakaposhi regions, LGM conditions could have nearly quadrupled the area abovethe snowline … For the plateaus and dissected plateaus, the effect of loweringEL As is even greater on the landscape. The Deosai Plateau is unglaciated todaybut would have been blanketed by an ice sheet during LGM conditions.57[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn57]Years ago, so long ago it seems like a former incarnation, I flew in afive-seater Alouette helicopter over the bleak high plains of the Deosai plateauabove Skardu. At one edge of the plains, which, if not permanently glaciated,were certainly deeply blanketed in snow, there is a lake, frozen most of theyear round, called Shershar. Hovering over it in the thin air, we could see thedistant peaks of the surrounding mountains, ice-bound, marching away in alldirections.It was March or April of 1981, I was still thirty and I was working with MohamedAmin – a great friend and a great photographer who much later tragically losthis life in the Ethiopian Airlines hijack of 1996. We spent an exhilarating,nerve-racking fortnight flying around the Karakorams in the Alouette, which wasowned by the Pakistan Army and piloted by a lieutenant colonel and a major withimpressive handlebar moustaches. We were based in Gilgit, in the shadow of the7,788 metre shark-tooth peak of Rakaposhi, and every day we went out and flew atridiculous altitudes through the mountains – sometimes plunging down below thesnowline into secret, verdant valleys – so that Mo could get the spectacularphotographs that would later feature in our book Journey Through Pakistan.58[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn58] On the third morning, in allseriousness, I wrote out a will and left it with my passport in my hotel room.The Alouette had a service ceiling of around 3300 metres, but we frequentlystruggled and clattered up to over 5200 metres – the pilots said it was atraining exercise for them – and then just hung there suspended amidst theglaring white wilderness under the bright blue sky. It was a very macho thing todo with no oxygen on board and the machine wasn’t really built for it, but itbrought home to me, more clearly than any other experience could possibly havedone, how immense these mountains are. When we flew by Rakaposhi at 5000 metres,with our rotors almost brushing its flank, its peak still towered nearly 3000metres above us. And within a 160 kilometre radius of Gilgit there are 100 peaksover 5486 metres high, including K2 which, at 8610 metres, is the world’ssecond-highest mountain.59 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn59]In an area of such superlatives it is hardly surprising that the north-westHimalayas and the Karakorams contain some of the longest valley glaciers in theworld outside of the polar regions60[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn60] – and these huge glaciers coilthrough the ranges like ancient serpents of myth, their backs ridged withserried ranks of ice-scales.At the Last Glacial Maximum they may have been up to four times as massive andthe whole landscape surrounding them would have been locked and frozen in deepice-cover extending to altitudes of 4000 metres – as much as a kilometre furtherdown than today.61 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn61]Imagine what must have happened when all that ice melted down.SO, WHAT DID HAPPEN?The scientific literature covering various effects and phenomena of the Ice Agein the Himalaya/Karakoram area is growing fast – as is interest in this subjectamongst palaeoclimatologists and geologists.One important issue that has been much debated concerns the glaciation anddeglaciation of the Tibetan plateau at various periods during the past 2.5million years. It has even been controversially suggested that the geologicallyrecent uplift of Tibet as a result of mountain-building forces in the Himalayasbetween 3 and 2.5 million years ago may have been the specific trigger that setthe Pleistocene Ice Age in motion ‘through the effects this had on the Earth’srotation as well as on the circulation of ocean and atmosphere’.62[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn62]A related area of active debate concerns the overall extent of the Himalayanice-cap. Here, explains Edward Derbyshire of the University of London’sQuaternary Research Centre, the broad measure of agreement that exists on themagnitude of the ELA depression at the Last Glacial Maximum:is not matched by agreement on the regional extent of the last glaciation whichhas been described, at one extreme, as an ice sheet of continental scale and, atthe other, as an Alpine glaciation in the Karakoram-northwest Himalayan regionwith some trunk valleys remaining unglacierized.63[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn63]How is it possible for serious and respected scientists, reporting their studiesin peer-reviewed journals and working from essentially the same evidence base,to have come up with such divergent views about the extent of the Himalayanglaciation? ‘The explanation of the apparent paradox,’ suggests Derbyshire, liesin the difficulty of interpreting the chaotic geological record in thisextremely mountainous region:The world’s greatest relief is a locus of enormous geodynamic energy consistingof a complex interplay between tectonics and glacial and fluvial erosionassociated with widespread and frequently catastrophic mass wasting. One obviousproduct of such a situation is the problem of reliably discriminating betweendiamictons deposited by glacier ice and those laid down by other processes. Thetwo suites of processes are frequently intimately related, posing a recurrentchallenge to those attempting to establish limits of past glaciations.64[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn64]‘Diamicton’ is a general term used to describe a mixture of sand, clay, silt orgravel that is laid down by various geological processes – notably the forces offlowing rivers, or moving glaciers, or lakes draining catastrophically.Derbyshire’s point is that where ongoing geological activity results in acontinuous mixing up and redepostion of the materials being studied – as is mostdefinitely the case in the Himalayas – then there is obviously going to beuncertainty over the extent of glaciation in the region at any particular momentin the past.The range of the uncertainty surrounding the extent of the ice-cap at the LGMis, however, surprisingly large – since there is all the difference in the worldbetween ‘an ice-cap of continental scale’ on the one hand, and a regional‘Alpine glaciation’ on the other. Moreover, this uncertainty seems even greaterwhen it comes to immediately post-glacial events. Indeed, although a great dealis known about the cataclysmic meltdown of other ice-caps in this period, I wassurprised to discover that the literature has relatively little to say aboutwhat happened in the Himalayas after the LGM.65[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn65]BEFORE AND AFTERScientists have been able to pick up traces of at least one cataclysmic meltingevent that took place in the area before the LGM. It is another measure of theuncertainty of the data available for study that the date-range offered for thisflood is very wide – it could have happened any time between 28,000 years agoand 43,000 years ago.66 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn66]Fortunately, its imprint on the landscape has not been as badly obliterated andjumbled as those of earlier and later floods and geologists have narrowed itslocation to the Upper Chandra valley in the Lahul Himalaya. Using landforms andsediment data, Peter Coxon, Lewis Owen and Wishart Mitchell, writing in theJournal of Quaternary Science, conclude that former glacial Lake Batal – whichhad backed up the Chandra valley for about 14 kilometres – suddenly burstthrough its ice dam. When it did so it released almost one and a half cubickilometres of water into the valley in less than a day: ‘This cataclysmic floodwas responsible for major resedimentation and landscape modification within theChandra valley.’67 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn67]Further striking but unfortunately undatable evidence of colossal ancientoutburst floods is provided by the presence of numbers of large bouldersscattered across the Potwar plateau – so-called ‘Punjab erratics’ – whichgeologists now believe were ‘carried down the Indus valley by catastrophicflooding, probably in iceberg rafts’68[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn68] The traces of violent outburstfloods long after the post-glacial meltdown was over, have also been widelyrecognized and there are a number of eye-witness accounts. In 1959, for example,there wasa sudden outburst from an ice-dammed lake in the Shimsal valley which caused aflood wave of approximately 30 metres to be produced, destroying the village ofPasu at the confluence with the Hunza River, 40 kilometres down-valley.69[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn69]Similarly, when a moraine-dammed glacial lake in the Khumbu area of easternNepal called Dig Tsho burst on 4 August 1985, the consequences for the regionwere catastrophic:The destruction of a newly-built hydroelectric power plant, 14 bridges, about 30houses, and many hectares of valuable arable land, as well as a heavily damagedtrail network resulted from 5 million cubic metres of water plummeting down theBhote Kosi and Dudh Kosi valleys. The breaching of the moraine was triggered bywave action following an ice avalanche of 150,000 cubic metres into the lake.The surge had a peak discharge of 1600 cubic metres per second; 3 million cubicmetres of debris were moved within a distance of less than 40 kilometres.70[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn70]The most spectacular event, however, was undoubtedly the great Indus flood of1841 – a deluge of near biblical proportions which, like the return of thewaters of the Red Sea after the Hebrews had passed safely through to the otherside, destroyed a vast army.The first step was an earthquake in late 1840 or early 1841. The earthquakecaused the collapse of the Lichar Spur, part of the flank of Nanga Parbat, whichblocked the Indus valley to a depth of 300 metres, strangled the downstream flowof the Indus to a trickle for six months and caused a lake 60 kilometres longand 300 metres deep to back up behind it. When the blockage was breached in June1841 a gigantic flood wave was released. The wave raced downstream along the (bythen almost dry) course of the Indus at a terrifying pace and fell upon a Sikharmy that was camped on the Chach plain near Attock, 400 kilometresdownstream.71 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn71] Eye-witnesses laterreported that:A wall of mud, many tens of metres high, rushed down the watercourses. Thosepeople not fast enough to reach the high ground, numbering several thousandtroops and camp followers, were lost. Trees were uprooted, buildings destroyed,artillery guns scattered, and farmland washed away. Large areas of the Vale ofPeshawar were flooded as the various tributaries banked up against the Indusfloodwaters.72 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn72]Today there is increasing awareness of the dangers posed by outburst floodsspecifically related to glaciation. It has been pointed out, for example, thatmore than thirty glaciers in the Karakoram mountains are presently in a positionto ‘form substantial dams on the Upper Indus and Yarkand river systems. Manymore interfere with the flow of rivers in a potentially dangerous way.’73[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn73] According to Kenneth Hewitt ofWilfred Laurier University, Canada:A particularly large and dangerous dam occurs where a glacier enters and blocksa major river valley of which it is a tributary … In one region of the world, …the Karakoram Himalaya and neighbouring ranges, there has been a substantialnumber of these main valley glacier lakes in modem times. Outbursts from aseries of dams … between 1926 and 1932 brought devastating floods along morethan 1200 kilometres of the Indus. Some even larger landslide dams and outburstfloods occurred here in the nineteenth century and an exceptional concentrationof surging glaciers has been found. Some of the latter have formed main valleyice dams … Thirty-five destructive outburst floods have been recorded in thepast two hundred years.74 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn74]STOCKTAKINGThere are a few details that are worth holding on to.The Equilibrium Line Altitude of glaciation in the Himalayas at the LGM wasabout three-quarters of a kilometre or more lower than it is today.The ice-cap at the LGM was much more extensive than it is today – although thereis no agreement over exactly how much more extensive.There have been catastrophic outburst floods from the Karakorams and theHimalayas in the past, floods that reshaped landscapes, floods that carriedicebergs full of huge impacted rocks all the way down to the Potwar plateau.Such outbursts continue to occur and even in the much reduced conditions oftoday’s glacial cover they can produce floodwaves 30 metres high capable ofsmashing whole villages to smithereens and destroying armies.The region is uniquely plagued by the particularly dangerous and rare phenomenonof its main river valleys being dammed by gigantic landslides or by theencroachment of glaciers – a sure recipe for catastrophic outburst flooding.Paradoxically, despite the evidence for catastrophic outburst floods before theLast Glacial Maximum, as well as in much more recent times, the literature paysscant attention to the issue of outburst flooding in the Himalayas during the10,000 years after the LGM.75 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn75]But this shouldn’t prevent us from asking a few common-sense questions: 1. If main river valleys are threatened by glaciers today, and if even a giant river like the Indus can be blocked for six months, then isn’t there every probability that the threat would have been much bigger and much worse under LGM conditions? 2. Is it unreasonable to speculate – as the Rig Veda has been telling us all along – that there could have been a time, within the memory of man, when some of the great rivers of north India were indeed choked off, most likely by giant glaciers entering and blocking their main valleys up in the Karakoram and Himalayan ranges? If so, then those glacial dams would eventually have burst asunder and the rivers chained up within them would have been set free once again … 3. Last but not least, is it so far-fetched to wonder if such a sequence of events might have inspired the great Vedic myth of Indra’s slaying of Vrtra with its specific symbolism of the freeing of the Seven Rivers?Probably no more far-fetched than the more orthodox ‘cloud-demon’ and ‘droughtdemon’ ideas, but hardly foolproof as a theory. For example, there’s the absenceof evidence of flooding in the Himalayas after the LGM – but that means verylittle given the state of the geological record (and the level of disagreementamongst geologists on the actual extent of the maximum glaciation).More seriously there is the other ‘face’ of the Vrtra myth – the clearassociation that some of the hymns make between the presence of the Dragon andthe withholding of rain on the one hand, and between the slaying of the Dragonby Indra and the return of the rain on the other.How is that to be explained if Vrtra is a symbol for glaciation?THE DRY AND THE WETSediments in ocean-bottom cores taken in the Arabian Sea off the south-westcoast of India contain pollen traces that tell us about the types of vegetationthat grew on the subcontinent at different periods going back to the LastGlacial Maximum – and since vegetation cover is determined by climate, reliabledeductions can be made from these pollen records about India’s climate in pastepochs.The Arabian Sea cores demonstrate that there was a period of extreme cold andaridity in India between 25,500 years ago and 21,500 years ago.76[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn76] This period is described by EliseVan Campo of the Université des Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc as ‘the LGMinterval’77 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn77] and coincides exactlywith other indications from around the world of the duration of LGM conditions(i.e., the Last Glacial Maximum was not a peak reached for a very short time,but rather a plateau of extreme glaciation that was sustained, in India at anyrate, for 4000 years). When warming did set in, it set in quickly and between21,500 years ago and 13,000 years ago the Indian climate did a 180-degree flipfrom cold and arid to warm and wet:The major fluctuations of the Indian monsoon climate are characterized by twoextreme periods, a very arid period around [25,500 to 21,500 years ago] and avery humid period culminating at [13,000 years ago] … The climate conditions ofthe LGM interval were greatly different from modern conditions. The southwestmonsoon, which produces a strong asymmetry between the western and the easterncoasts of the Arabian Sea, was considerably reduced and arid conditions werevery similar on both sides) …78 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn78](Carbon-14 dates in original text replaced with approximate equivalents incalendar years.)What this would have meant in the Himalayas between 25,500 and 21,500 years agowas 4000 years of deep freeze as the ice tightened its grip on the valleys andthe headwaters of the rivers in the mountains.Then at the peak of the LGM interval, some time soon after 21,500 years ago, thephase of warm, wet climate in India abruptly kicked in. Back to the Arabian Seacores, which demonstrate:an increase of monsoonal rainfall as early as about [19,700 years ago] at 10degrees north and at [18,500 years ago] at 15 degrees north. This period …culminates synchronously at [13,500 years ago] at 10 degrees and at 15 degreesnorth and is considered as the period of the greatest abundance of monsoonalrains.79 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn79]Worldwide, we know that the period of 14,000 to 13,000 years ago, whichcoincides with the peak of abundant monsoonal rains over India, was marked byviolent oceanic flooding – in fact, the first of the three great episodes ofglobal superfloods that dominated the meltdown of the Ice Age. The flooding wasfed not merely by rain but by the cataclysmic synchronous collapse of largeice-masses on several different continents and by gigantic inundations ofmeltwater pouring down river systems into the oceans.80[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn80]If this was happening in other glaciated regions such as North America andnorthern Europe between 14,000 and 13,000 years ago, then things are unlikely tohave been very different in the Himalayas, and it seems safe to assume thatthere must have been episodes of exceptionally powerful outburst flooding andthat all the great rivers from the Indus to the Ganges would at that time havebeen in full flow.So is 14,000 to 13,000 years ago a candidate epoch for the events recounted inthe Rig Veda as the slaying of Vrtra and the freeing of the Seven Rivers?The answer has to be no – simply because the previous 7000 years had witnessed acontinuous worldwide increase in temperature and because 14,000 to 13,000 yearsago was the peak and the climax of this long, humid warming phase in India. Assuch, it is most unlikely that the glaciers in the Karakorams and the Himalayaswould have been surging or advancing so as to block or ‘enchain’ rivers in theway that the Rig seems to describe. On the contrary, everything suggests thatthe flow of the rivers should have been uninterrupted from the end of the cold,dry LGM interval 21,000 years ago until the clear end of the humid phase thatshows up in the cores at around 13,000 years ago.Moreover, the Vedic myth portrays the slaying of Vrtra as being followed by therelease of the waters – both rivers and rain. This is very clear and, in a way,the point of the whole thing. But that was not what happened.A DRAGON CALLED THE YOUNGER DRYASWhat happened, at around 13,000 years ago, was that the long period ofuninterrupted warming that the world had just passed through (and that hadgreatly intensified, according to some studies, between 15,000 years ago and13,000 years ago)81 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn81] was instantlybrought to a halt – all at once, everywhere – by a global cold event known topalaeoclimatologists as the ‘Younger Dryas’ or ‘Dryas III’.82[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn82] In many ways mysterious andunexplained, this was an almost unbelievably fast climatic reversion – fromconditions that are calculated to have been warmer and wetter than today’s13,000 years ago,83 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn83] to conditionsthat were colder and drier than those at the Last Glacial Maximum, not much morethan a thousand years later.84 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn84]From that moment, around 12,800 years ago, it was as though an enchantment ofice had gripped the earth. In many areas that had been approaching terminalmeltdown full glacial conditions were restored with breathtaking rapidity andall the gains that had been made since the LGM were simply stripped away:Temperatures … fell back on the order of 8–15 degrees centigrade … with halfthis brutal decline possibly occurring within decades. The Polar Front in theNorth Atlantic redescended to the level of Cabo Finisterre in northwest Spainand glaciers readvanced in the high mountain chains. With respect to temperaturethe setback to full glacial conditions was nearly complete …85[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn85]For human populations at the time, in many except the most accidentally favouredparts of the world, the sudden and inexplicable plunge into severe cold andaridity must have been devastating. And in the Karakoram-Himalayan region, as inother glaciated areas, it is very likely that it was accompanied by asignificant readvance of the ice-cap that previously had been in recession forsome 7000 years.Is it possible that that this hypothetical readvance of the Himalayan ice-capbetween 12,800 years ago and 11,40086[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn86] years ago could be the eventpersonified in the Rig Veda as Vrtra the Dragon, the enchanter, the greatmagician, ‘who barred up the waters’?Since the slaying of Vrtra resulted in the release of the waters to flow to thesea, it obviously made sense to find out if there was evidence of suddenlarge-scale meltwater floods off the mountains shortly after 11,400 years agowhen the ‘climate switched back to warm, moist Holocene conditions, over only afew decades’.87 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn87]SALT AND FRESHWATERI did find evidence of floods. It was in another set of cores taken off theIndian coast. According to a report in Nature by a team of Australianscientists:Microfossil, sediment and oxygen-isotope studies of deep-sea cores from the Bayof Bengal and northern Arabian Sea have revealed strong contrasts between highlate Pleistocene and low early Holocene salinity values, indicative of majorchanges in runoff from the large rivers of southern Asia.88[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn88]Some definitions: salinity values measure the ‘saltiness’ of the sea, so ‘highsalinity values’ mean a saltier sea and low salinity values mean a less saltysea – i.e, a sea with more freshwater in it. The Pleistocene-Holocene boundaryis set, arbitrarily, at 12,000 years before the present. ‘Late Pleistocene’ isloose language but generally means the few thousand years before 12,000 yearsago. ‘Early Holocene’ is loose language too but generally means anywhere between12,000 years ago and 10,000 years ago.Why were India’s seas so salty just before 12,000 years ago? The most likelyexplanation is that the flow of the great rivers draining theKarakoram-Himalayan region had virtually ceased because of the advance ofglaciers into their main valleys during Dryas III – pretty much as the Rig Vedatells us (‘Ahi who besieged the waters … the insatiate one, extended, hard towaken, who slumbered in perpetual sleep’). Likewise, the explanation for the lowsalinity values that suddenly appear soon after 10,000 years ago is a suddengigantic inrush of freshwater to the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal on ascale that could have been caused by the breaching of ice dams in the Himalayas,the freeing of rivers pent up behind them, and the flushing out of parts of theice-cap. (The Dragon stretched against the seven prone rivers, where no jointwas, thou rentest with thy thunder.’ ‘Like lowing kine in rapid flow descending,the waters glided downward to the ocean.’)All in all, therefore, even in the absence of direct evidence of flooding of thetype described in the Rig Veda, the indirect evidence from the ocean cores doessuggest that such floods must have occurred and that they could have followed aperiod, however brief, when the main rivers of northern India had in fact driedup. So the hypothesis that the Vrtra story in the Rig Veda might be describingglacial outburst floods remains a reasonable one.89[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn89]Conveniently, the ambiguity over Vrtra’s character is also removed. Now he is atone and the same time an ice dragon blocking the flow of the mighty rivers and arain-withholding demon whose period of grim enchantment over the Himalayas isbrought to an end not only by the freeing of the rivers but also by the abruptreturn to heavy rains and warm, wet conditions that we know followed the YoungerDryas.90 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn90]All this is speculation, of course, and implicit in it is a deeply hereticalassumption – the assumption that the sages who composed at least some of theverses of the Vedas could have been in the Himalayas 12,000 years ago to witnessthe end of the Younger Dryas cold advance and to commemorate it as Indra’svictory over Vrtra. This does not fit at all with the much later date thatscholars habitually assign to composition of the Rig Veda – but then neither dothe accounts of a full and turbulent Sarasvati that the Rig provides us with andthat also seem to sketch out the archaic geography of 10,000 or more years ago.MEHRGARH’S YOGIC ETHICGrowing up in the industrialized and now the electronic world, dominated as ithas been by the rival material philosophies of capitalism and communism, weautomatically imbibe from schools, peers and parents the idea that civilizationis something that man invented in order to meet his material and economic needs.This is why, when archaeologists look for the origins of civilization, they lookfor the material and economic forces that might have driven hunter-gatherers tobecome farmers and to create the first permanent village communities.But India, with its vibrant spiritual culture, its armies of ragged pilgrims andits remarkable Vedas raises the possibility that the real origins ofcivilization could be very different – not driven by economics but by thespiritual quest that all true ascetics of India still pursue with the utmostdedication. Such a quest does not deny that the basic material requirements ofthe human creature must be met but seeks to limit our attachment to materialthings and in general to subordinate material needs to mental and spiritualself-discipline.In the sparseness, understatement and efficiency of Mehrgarh’s most ancientperiod could it be that we are seeing the imprint of this essentially yogicethic – which the Vedas anyway tell us was the ethic of most ancient India?And since archaeologists are now in universal agreement that there is anunbroken continuity of culture from Mehrgarh I around 9000 years ago all the waydown to the great cities of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization around 4500 yearsago, shouldn’t we expect signs of the same yogic ethic to turn up there?"},{"pageContent":"PART THREEINDIA (2)"},{"pageContent":"9 / FAIRYTALE KINGDOMIf Dwarka could be located and identified, well the personality of Krishna isnot a myth but a fact.S. R. Rao, discoverer of the Dwarka underwater ruins, 29 February 2000I stood in the Harappan Gallery of the National Museum in New Delhi peeringthrough security glass at a small steatite seal from Mohenjodaro. Dated toapproximately 2700 BC,1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn1] the sealdepicts an ascetic seated in difficult posture of highly advanced yoga known asmulubandhasana.2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn2] Lean-waisted,bearded, half-naked, phallus erect, the figure wears a head-dress of buffalohorns over long, unkempt hair. His face might be a mask. It is powerful, almosthypnotic, and there is the suggestion of two further faces (or masks?) inprofile looking to either side. He is surrounded, but clearly unthreatened, bydangerous big-game animals – wild buffalo, rhinoceros, elephant, tiger. His armsare covered with bangles and stretched out so that his hands rest loosely on hisknees – the traditional signal of a state of profound meditation.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_041_r1.jpg]Pasupati seal (2700 BC) from Mohenjodaro, showing a god in a yogic posture.It is often said that we can never hope to learn much about the religiousbeliefs or the guiding philosophy of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization because wecannot read its script – a line of which appears above the meditating figure.Yet even though the inscription is opaque to us this enigmatic seal fromMohenjodaro does provide some definite and indeed rather intriguing information.It tells us that at least the outward appearances of the ascetic mind-bodydisciplines of meditation and physical self-control which still lie at the heartof the spiritual lifestyle in Hindu India in the twenty-first century were beingpractised 4700 years ago in the Indus-Sarasvati cities.It tells us specifically that yoga, one of the six orthodox schools of Vedicphilosophy,3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn3] was already known4700 years ago as a fully evolved system – since mulubandhasana cannot beachieved by beginners but requires the prior mastery of numerous intermediatepostures.4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn4] Unless we are toimagine that yoga was miraculously conjured into being all at once as a completesystem 4700 years ago, it tells us that the origins of the system must be mucholder even than that. And since variants of the lean, unkempt yogic figureperforming mulubandhasana are ‘amongst the most common motifs in Indus ritualart’,5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn5] it tells us that theclassic image of the rishi, the yogic sage or seer, that is summoned up againand again in the Vedas, was also ubiquitous amongst the Indus-Sarasvati peoplein the third millennium BC.Moreover, if scholars are right in their universal consensus that theMohenjodaro seal ‘depicts the figure of a god seated in yogic posture’6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn6] then we are witness to an amazingcontinuity in religious iconography – for to this day the Hindu god Siva is ‘theLord of Yoga’ and is to be seen depicted on temple walls throughout India as alean, almost naked, meditating ascetic with shaggy hair and sometimes even witha similarly erect penis (the latter feature not meant to imply unconstrainedlust but rather its opposite; in Tantric Hinduism Siva’s erection symbolizescomplete yogic control of bodily desires).7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn7] Siva, too, is called Pasupati, the‘beastmaster’ or ‘Lord of animals’, because of his ability to tame ferociousbeasts with his yogic powers – exactly in the manner in which the figure on theMohenjodaro seal seems to be portrayed.8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn8] Even the phallic lingam symbol(the butter-smeared stone column erected in the inner sanctum of every Sivatemple in India and regarded by worshippers as an embodiment of the god himself)is prefigured in the Indus-Sarasvati cities by conical sacred stones or‘proto-linga’.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn9]For all these reasons the yogic god on the steatite seal has been known as‘proto-Siva’, and also routinely spoken of by archaeologists as ‘the Pasupatifigure’, since its discovery during excavations in the DK area of Mohenjodaro in1928/9.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn10] Yet Western scholarslike Jonathan Kennoyer attach little significance to the comparisons that invokesuch epithets:The figure has been referred to as ‘proto-Siva’ because of its similarity tolater iconography of the deity Siva from the Hindu pantheon. Whereas many laterHindu deities may have had their roots in earlier beliefs of the Indus Valley orother indigenous communities living in the subcontinent, we cannot confirmspecific connections between the horned figure on the Indus seals and laterHindu deities. There are similarities in the iconography but the meaning relayedmay have been significantly different.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn11]THE VEDAS AND ARCHAEOLOGYI left the Harappan Gallery deep in thought and walked across the corridor intothe Museum’s circular central garden. I realized that I felt irritated byKennoyer’s caution. And it wasn’t just because he was downplaying the manyinteresting iconographic links between Siva and the Mohenjodaro figure. Unspokenbehind this was the larger problem of the Vedas, which also describe a Siva-likeor ‘proto-Siva’ deity – the Vedic god Rudra12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn12] – and which bestow the utmostrespect, even awe, upon seven rishis with yogic powers.I found a shady spot to sit down, opened my notebook and scrawled the wordsSummary of Vedic traditions about the origins of civilization in India at thetop of a blank page:Summary of Vedic traditions about the origins of civilization in India: 1. An earlier civilization, which knew the Vedas and practised yoga, existed before the great flood and was destroyed by it. 2. Manu and the Seven Rishis (Saptarishi) were yogic adepts who survived the flood. 3. The role of the Seven Rishis was to preserve the Vedas through memorization and to repromulgate them amongst post-diluvial humanity. 4. The role of Manu was to re-establish agriculture after the flood, using a cache of seeds and plants that he had brought with him for this purpose, and to become the progenitor of future civilized humanity by fathering a dynasty of kings. 5. The Vedas and the traditions that descend from them depict the Saptarishi as a lineage of ascetics. After the flood their primary abode was in the Himalayas, where they would retreat to meditate and perform austerities, but they also played decisive roles in running and ordering secular affairs, and in the making and guidance of kings. 6. The so-called Saptarishi calendar of ancient India, which of course cannot be separated from the traditions of the Seven Rishis, has a start date around 6700 BC – almost 9000 years ago.Summary of archaeological evidence about the origins of civilization in India: 1. Fully functional Village farming communities’ like Mehrgarh in the foothills of the Himalayas appear suddenly in the archaeological record somewhere around 9000 years ago. It’s a bit of a mystery. No clear antecedents have yet been found. The original settlers came with seeds and already knew how to farm. 2. This happened in the midst of an epoch of cataclysmic global floods that saw huge areas of India’s continental shelf inundated. The possibility, therefore, cannot be ruled out that the founders of Mehrgarh had previously lived on lands swallowed up by the rising seas. 3. There is an unbroken archaeological continuum between Mehrgarh 1 A around 7000 BC and the upsurge of Mohenjodaro and Harappa as great cities after 3000 BC. For some reason the rate of growth and development became particularly rapid between 2600 and 2500 BC – the mature phase of incredibly vigorous urban expansion – but you can see the roots even of this phase in many small and large details more than 4000 years older exposed in the excavations of the first habitation layers at Mehrgarh. 4. The paramount ritual image to have come down to us from Mohenjodaro and Harappa, and therefore likely to be connected in some way to this ancient heritage, recognizably portrays a rishi seated in an advanced yogic posture and seemingly deep in meditation.Question:Why should the people of the largest and most sophisticated urban civilizationof antiquity have specially venerated the figure of a half-naked asceticmeditating in a rural setting surrounded by ferocious animals?If the Vedas were the scriptures of Mohenjodaro and Harappa, then an answerimmediately suggests itself.They would have venerated the image because they would have been taught fromchildhood that their civilization had been founded, and that it continued to beguided, by rishis looking exactly like this.I closed my notebook and returned to the Harappan Gallery for another look atthe cross-legged, three-faced, buffalo-horned rishi of Mohenjodaro. Well, notexactly cross-legged, in fact – because to perform mulubandhasana you first haveto sit down and bring your heels together with your feet pointing forward whilstplacing your knees flat on the ground. Next, with your feet still pointingforward, you tuck your heels in under your perineum. Then you turn your feet afull 180 degrees under your body so that they now point excruciatingly backwards– a manoeuvre that will disclocate the ankles of an inexperienced practitioner.Then you meditate.How long, I wondered again, does it take to perfect a system like yoga? And ifit was already perfect 4700 years ago, then how many thousands of years beforethat must its roots go back, what are we to conclude about the level ofdevelopment of the supposedly Stone Age people who created it, and why is thereno archaeological trace of them?RETURN TO THE DIVING QUESTFEBRUARY 2000From Delhi I flew to Goa to meet marine archaeologists at India’s NationalInstitute of Oceanography, whose research, I hoped, might provide me with someanswers. I had already been in contact with them by e-mail and telephone formore than a year, trying to arrange to dive at Dwarka – which still fascinatedme, as it had since 1992, with its ancient legends of a flood at the end of aworld age and its mysterious underwater ruins. The archaeologists seemedfriendly enough, even enthusiastic, but answered to higher authorities in theIndian government whose blessing they needed before they could agree to let medive with them.By this stage, early February 2000, I still didn’t have a clear chronology inwhich to place the underwater structures at Dwarka. Nor, it seemed to me, didthe NIO. As I’ve reported in previous chapters, there was a general assumptionthat the ruins had been submerged by relatively recent land subsidence (notrising sea-levels) and that they belonged to a very late period of theIndus-Sarasvati civilization – 1700–1500 BC. But the marine archaeologists hadnot recovered any datable artefacts that could confirm or deny this theory.All the more I wanted to look for myself and form my own opinion.LEGACY OF A LOST CIVILIZATIONFEBRUARY 2000On the flights to Goa, and the long stopover in Mumbai, I went back over some ofthe evidence on the origins of civilization in India I’d been considering inrecent months, reread the notes I had made in the National Museum in Delhi, andthen, in large letters, wrote the word Hypothesis at the top of an empty page:Hypothesis:The Indus-Sarasvati civilization, the development of which archaeologists havealready traced back 9000 years, has an earlier episode of hidden prehistory. Itwas founded by the survivors of a lost Indian coastal civilization destroyed bythe great global floods at the end of the Ice Age.Such floods occurred many times between 15,000 and 7000 years ago, but aparticularly bad episode is attested in high salinity levels in the Arabian Seaand the Bay of Bengal between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn13]The convergence of archaeological evidence is that the first food-producingvillages like Mehrgarh were established immediately after the worst floodingbetween 10,000 and 9000 years ago. For example, Gregory Possehl: There is noentirely satisfactory chronology for the Indus Age, especially for the internalstages and phases of prehistoric life. Present estimates, based on radiocarbondates, suggest that it arises at 7000 or 8000 BC with the earliest villages, thedomestication of plants and animals and the beginnings of farming and herdingsocieties.’14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn14]The survivors who established the early villages practised a ‘proto-Vedic’religion that they had brought with them from their inundated homeland andprobably spoke an early form of Sanskrit.The survivors were experienced farmers, as the archaeological record confirms,and their cultural level was high, but religious and philosophicalconsiderations (perhaps even a reaction to the supposed ‘judgement’ of the floodon their former lifestyle?) led them to create a sparse, utilitarian and asceticnew world – even as they moved gradually towards ever larger and more complexurban communities.There were secular rulers but the real leadership of the new communitiesremained vested down the generations in the brotherhood of sages whoseforefathers had escaped the deluge – the lineage of Vedic masters whose task itwas to preserve and transmit a precious body of antediluvian knowledge. Forthousands of years, from Mehrgarh to Mohenjodaro, it was the policies set bythese great rishis in pursuit of that objective – rather than in response toeconomic or other material forces – that shaped the steady, peaceful, modestmaterial development of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization.It was a hypothesis – just that, nothing more. But I’d already been playingaround with it in my mind for months as my research on India had progressed andit was time to set it down on paper. Nothing in it contradicted thearchaeological evidence. It made sense of the sudden and fully formed appearanceof village-farming communities like Mehrgarh between 10,000 and 9000 years ago.It took proper account, as other theories did not, of the latest science on theend of the Ice Age. It provided a rational basis in real events for the Indianflood myth. And it explained the phenomenal longevity and continuity of theIndus-Sarasvati civilization from the simplicity of its sudden beginnings at theend of the Ice Age until its equally sudden boom and collapse in the thirdmillennium BC.There was one way to prove the hypothesis very quickly. All I had to do was findruins more than 9000 years old underwater on India’s continental shelf. And thatwas the private hope I had for Dwarka.GATEKEEPERS OF THE FAIRYTALE KINGDOMThe headquarters of the National Institute of Oceanography are in Dona Paula,Goa, in a pleasant university-style campus of trees and lawns. As well asoccupying a modern block on the highest point of the campus, the Institute’smany divisions, sub-divisions and laboratories sprawl outwards into a suburb ofold-fashioned bungalows set beneath the trees. The Marine Archaeology Centre isin one of these, identifiable by a display of stone anchors and other stoneobjects mostly retrieved from depths of 5–10 metres amongst the underwater ruinsat Dwarka.My appointment was with Kamlesh Vora, the NIO’s head of archaeology, with whom Ihad been corresponding. I appreciated that he had taken the trouble to processmy proposal at all, since he could perfectly easily have dismissed it out ofhand or just ignored it, but the fact was that many months had passed and therewas still no sign either of approval or disapproval from the higher authorities– in Delhi as it happened – to whom he had submitted it.‘Now that you are here,’ he said, ‘perhaps it will galvanize them into action.’He picked up the telephone and placed a call to the offices of the ScientificResearch Council, the NIO’s parent organization and an important spoke in thewheel of central government. A lengthy conversation then followed in Hindi.Finally, Kamlesh hung up: ‘There is a certain lady within the SRC who I need totalk to about your case.’ He gave me a gloomy look: ‘Unfortunately she is not ather desk today’ A smile: ‘But I’ll find her tomorrow.’‘What do you expect the answer will be?’Kamlesh became gloomy again and explained that never before had the NIO had todeal with a request from an author to dive with them at Dwarka. If I was anacademic or governmental institution seeking to send an observer to the sitethere would be set procedures to follow and the permission process would goalong according to a well-ordered routine. But since I was a private individual,non-governmental, non-academic, and non-Indian into the bargain (raising issuesabout what sort of visa I should be travelling on), no one knew what to do withme.And here was the problem. The NIO’s annual campaign in Dwarka, which I washoping to join, was scheduled to go ahead in mid-February (less than two weekshence) but would continue only until mid-March. So my permission had to comethrough before then. If it didn’t I’d miss the campaign and therefore would losemy chance to dive at Dwarka until the following year.‘You mean you only dive there for one month every year?’‘If we’re lucky. Our funds are very limited, but we do what we can.’‘What if I make my own arrangements? If the permission comes through after theNIO has gone is there any way that I can arrange to dive privately at Dwarka?’Kamlesh was horrified: ‘No, not at all. It is a protected nationalarchaeological site, so our people have to be with you. Besides, there’s noprivate diving at Dwarka. There are no facilities there. It’s a very out of theway place. We bring our own compressor and tanks with us from Goa every year andtake them away again when we leave …’My heart sank. Since I’d first learned of it in 1992 as a non-diver, theunderwater city of Dwarka had beckoned to me like a fairytale kingdom thatseemed far beyond my reach. Eight years later I’d acquired the skills, but notyet the permission, to dive at it. And I felt helpless to influence the matterin any way.‘Come and see me mid-morning tomorrow,’ Kamlesh said. ‘I will try again with theSRC. Maybe I will have good news for you.’WRITE A LETTERI was back with Kamlesh by eleven the next morning, but there was no news, goodor bad. The lady at the SRC was still not at her desk. He called her again.Still nothing. Finally, half an hour later, she answered her phone. Yes, she hadreceived the paperwork concerning my proposed visit. Yes, it was beingconsidered. No, there was no decision as yet. Kamlesh asked if anything could bedone to speed things up. It might be a good idea, she told him, if I were towrite a letter explaining in greater detail than in my original proposal exactlywhy I wanted to dive at Dwarka.Suppressing a mood of rising irritation and bad temper, I took a taxi back tothe Ciudad de Goa hotel, fired up my portable computer and began to draft theletter – which Kamlesh suggested I should address in the first instance to DrEhrlich Desa, the Director of the NIO. ‘If he intervenes with the SRC on behalfof your case it will make a great difference.’When I met Kamlesh later in the afternoon to review the text of the letter, hetold me that he had spoken to Dr Desa who had agreed to see me at ten the nextmorning.Two days later I left Goa. Permission had still not been given. But my meetingwith Ehrlich Desa had been encouraging and he had promised his support infast-tracking my application through the SRC. I felt confident that he andKamlesh would do their best for me, and vaguely optimistic that somehow thenecessary strings would be pulled to allow me to dive at Dwarka. We agreed tostay in touch by e-mail.INTERLUDE: THE QUEST FOR KUMARI RANDAMMy trip to India in February 2000 had multiple objectives and I had intendedfrom the beginning to be on the road until the middle of March. So although thehold-ups and uncertainties about Dwarka were worrying, they hadn’t yet reallyinconvenienced me. It was perfectly possible that permission could still begranted …Meanwhile Santha and I had long planned another journey in southern India andflew first to Madras, now called Chennai, to pick up where we had left off in1992.Then it had been a journey of personal reminiscence – Vellore and the shoretemples of Mahabalipuram on the Coromandel coast. Now we would start inMahabalipuram, travel inland from there to Tiruvannamalai, a temple sacred toSiva since time immemorial, and thence to Madurai, an ancient centre of Tamillearning linked again to the yogic god Siva. To the north-east of Madurai weplanned to visit Poompuhur, and to the south-east Rameswaram on the thin spit ofmainland that reaches out towards Sri Lanka, dividing the Palk Strait from theGulf of Mannar. Then we would go on to Kaniya Kumari – Cape Comorin – on thesouthernmost tip of India.During 1999 I had begun background research on southern India and had beenintrigued by what I had found.One source of information that had lain unopened in my library for far too longwas Captain M. W. Carr’s Descriptive and Historical Papers Relating to the SevenPagodas of the Coromandel Coast.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn15] As I reported in chapter 5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05], Carr’s anthology preserves stronglocal traditions of a fabulous antediluvian city at Mahabalipuram swallowed upby the waters of a great flood. Those traditions had certainly been in widecirculation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when the papers in Carr’santhology were written. I wanted to find out if they were still in circulationtoday and if there could be any substance to them.I had also come across the work of David Shulman, Professor of Indian Studiesand Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. His wide-ranginginvestigation of Tamil flood myths had helped to put places like Poompuhur,Madurai and Kaniya Kumari on the map for me. In the Tamil epic known as theManimekalai it was said that the ancient port-city of Kaveripumpattinam had beenflooded by the sea off the Poompuhur shore. Other traditions spoke ofprehistoric wisdom schools or academies (sangam) established ‘in an antediluvianTamil land stretching far to the south of the present southern border at CapeComorin’.16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn16] The name of this lostland, which had been swallowed up by the sea in two distinct inundationsseparated by thousands of years, was Kumari Kandam, and its last survivors weresaid to have fled to Madurai.17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn17]As usual when I’m on the road I was carrying a shoulder bag full of books andreference materials with me, some brought from England, some picked up along theway. Following my few days in Goa, I had added substantially to my stack with apile of bulky annual conference reports and back numbers of the NIO’s Journal ofMarine Archaeology that Kamlesh had given me.Serendipitously the very first of these that I browsed through on the flightfrom Goa to Chennai (volume 5–6 of 1995–6) opened with a lengthy paper entitled‘Underwater Explorations off Poompuhur 1993.’18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn18] Much of the paper concentrated onan archaeological validation of the Manimekalai myth, connecting it to thesubmerged ruins of Kaveripumpattinam ‘an ancient port town of 3rd century BC to4th century BC’ that the NIO’s marine archaeologists had identified very closeto the shore in water generally less than 3 metres deep.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn19] But the paper also reported theanomalous U-shaped structure that the divers had found at a depth of 23 metresmore than 5 kilometres out to sea.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn20]I immediately realized that this obscure and neglected reference to a 1993exploration that the NIO had never had the funds to follow up was potentiallysignificant. I did not then have access, as I would later, to Glenn Milne’scomputerized inundation maps. But at that depth and that distance from theshore, common sense alone suggested that the U-shaped structure must beextremely old.21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn21]The main author of the report and team-leader of the Poompuhur exploration hadbeen S. R. Rao, Kamlesh Vora’s predecessor at the NIO and the originaldiscoverer of the underwater ruins of Dwarka. Since he was now retired andliving in Bangalore, only a short hop from Chennai, I decided on impulse that atsome point on our journey in the south I would try to meet him.‘IT MUST HAVE EXISTED …’FEBRUARY 2000My encounter with Rao, which I’ve already reported in chapter 1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01], took place on 29 February. To myamazement the doyen of Indian marine archaeology proved open to the notion thatan antediluvian civilization could have existed on the Indian coastal landsflooded at the end of the Ice Age:It must have existed. You can’t rule that out at all. Particularly, as I havesaid, since we have found this structure at 23 metre depth. I mean we havephotographed it. It is there, anybody can go and see it. I do not believe it isan isolated structure; further exploration is likely to reveal others roundabout. And then you can go deeper, you see, and you may get more importantthings.22 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn22]Well return to the quest for Kumari Kandam in chapter 11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11]. For me a big part of it unfolded thereand then in the year 2000 and an even bigger part – the diving part – in 2001.Meanwhile, a couple of days before my encounter with Rao, something suddenlyshifted in the turgid backlog of Indian bureaucracy and Kamlesh e-mailed me withthe good news that the permission had come through – ‘at the eleventh hour’ ashe put it – and that I would be allowed to dive at Dwarka with the NIO team.Much was owed, apparently, to the robust support given to our adventure by DrDesa. At any rate there would be no further obstacles and Santha and I shouldplan to reach Dwarka on 2 March.THE PROBLEM OF DWARKA’S AGEMARCH 2000It felt good to be back in Dwarka again after so many years away and to have theopportunity at last to look into the mystery of its underwater ruins.When I’d interviewed him in Bangalore, Rao had reaffirmed his longstanding viewthat the ruins are those of an Indus-Sarasvati port probably built between 1700BC and 1500 BC during the final years of the civilization’s decline and thenflooded by an incursion of the sea. However, he admitted that the dates were asupposition not an empirical fact. Radiocarbon or thermoluminescence tests,which might settle the matter, had not been possible, since the latter requirespottery contemporary with the ruins and the former organic materialscontemporary with the ruins – neither of which had yet been found in submergedDwarka itself:Rao: I mean to be frank, you see, we did some thermoluminescence dating for thepottery extracted from the wall which is just on the shore – and of course italso partially gets submerged at some times. All right, that gives 1528 BC. Butthat is at a slightly higher terrace than the submerged one. So the submergedone must be earlier.GH: Would it be fair to say, concerning the underwater structures, that theminimum age would be about 1500 BC but that it is possible that they may beolder?Rao: Oh yes, definitely, that you can definitely say. Minimum age would be abouteven 1500, 1600 BC, but an earlier date can’t be ruled out. I mean there isevery possibility of getting earlier dates.GH: My understanding is that underwater structures that have been identified sofar go down to about 12 metres under the sea?Rao: These structures go to about 10 metres depth. Of course, the ridge whichwas converted into a sort of wharf, that is at 12 metres depth. Beyond that wehave gone, but not much.23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn23]GH: Do you think there’s any chance of further ruins being found further outinto the sea?Rao: Maybe. Maybe. I won’t rule that out at all. Because, you see, what we did[beyond the 12 metre depth contour] was only side-scan sonar survey. I mean, alittle diving as well we have done here, but not much, to be frank. I mean, ifyou dive for three days or four days only then you cannot expect to find much…24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn24]EXPECTING THE BESTWe were to dive at Dwarka off a small wooden sea-going trawler, arough-and-ready working ship crewed by local fishermen that the NIO hadchartered. Since its draft was too deep to approach the shore it was moored inthe bay about half a kilometre to the south-west in front of the Gomati rivermouth. We were ferried out to it in an inflatable dinghy that picked us up fromthe steps of Gomati Ghat, and as we chugged across the bay I found myselflooking down impatiently at the water, hoping to get some glimpse of whateverlay below.The ruins had been thoroughly mapped by the NIO across a large area between themouth of the Gomati – which now lay behind our dinghy to the north-east – and asubmerged rock ridge about a kilometre out to sea to the south-west that hadbeen cut and modified as a wharf when it was above water in ancient times. Thiswas the wharf that Rao had mentioned as the site’s deepest known structure at 12metres and which he suspected to have been part of its harbour.All the other remains, revealing the outlines of a series of spaciousrectilinear buildings, lay much closer to shore between just 3 and 10 metreswith the majority concentrated between 5 and 7 metres.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn25] These included twelve so-called‘citadels’, protected by massive bastions, six on each bank of a now submergedsection of the Gomati channel, where Rao told me he thought that ‘not only theKing but also the army chief, other officials or his ministers used to live’.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn26] The ancient harbour city itselfwas divided into six blocks:All six sectors have protective walls built of large well-dressed blocks ofsandstone, some as large as 1.5 to 2 m long, 0.5 to 0.75 m wide and 0.3 to 0.5 mthick. L-shaped joints in the masonry suggest that a proper grip was provided soas to withstand the battering of waves and currents. At close intervalssemi-circular or circular bastions were built along the fort walls in order todivert the current and to have a proper overview of the incoming and outgoingships … There are entrance gateways in all sectors as surmised on the basis ofthe sill of the openings. The fort walls and bastions, built from large blockswhich are too heavy to be moved by waves and currents, are in situ up to one ortwo metres height above the boulder foundation in the sea. In a few places asmany as five courses of masonry are visible but in others the wall and bastionhave collapsed.27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn27][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_042_r1.jpg]Map of submerged ruins off Dwarka. Based on Rao (1999).Prepped by such imagery of a fairytale underwater city, and the beautifulreconstructions of antediluvian Dwarka that feature in Rao’s books, I confess Iwas expecting the best as I clambered out of the dinghy and up the side of theNIO’s chartered fishing boat on the morning of 3 March 2000.FOG, WEED AND SLUDGEIn the relentless war of heat-exchange that goes on between a diver and the sea,it is the sea that always wins in the end. The process is faster in cold water,slower in warm water, and can be delayed further by an insulating wetsuit;however, the end result is always the same. If the sea is colder than thediver’s body temperature then the diver’s body temperature will begin to fall.I think of myself as a reasonably experienced diver but I’m fifty years old, waypast my peak fitness, and I make mistakes. The mistake I made at Dwarka, thoughI’d been warned that the water was only 23 degrees centigrade (and thus 14degrees below body temperature), was not to wear a wetsuit. This would have beenfine if I’d been going down for just one or two short dives. But we did threedives that day, running to an hour or more each.The first two dives were on the big concentration of ruins that the NIO hadmapped between the 5 and 7 metre contour lines. Gone were the lofty turrets,battlements and bastions of Rao’s reconstructions and of my imagination. Allseemed to have been reduced to a ruin-field of haphazardly strewn stone blocks,the angles and edges of which poked here and there out of the thick sludge ofsediment and slimy green weed that carpeted everything. And although the sea wascalm that morning, allowing some settlement of silts carried down into the bayby the Gomati river, millions of tiny particles hung suspended in the water,scattering light like a fog.Through the fog I was just able to make out beneath me several dozen largelimestone blocks that seemed to have come from a collapsed section of wall, notquite megalithic in the strict sense of the term, but very close to it, tumbledon top of one another. The wall had been dry-stone – no mortar in the joints tokeep the courses together. But I could see how the masons had dealt with theproblem. Many of the bigger blocks had been designed to lock into each otherwith dovetails and, as Rao had commented, with carefully chiselled L-shapedjoints which would have given extra structural stability.The same architectural principle had been used in the massive curved bastionsthat had stood at the corners of the citadels. Although I found none intact, Iseveral times came across huge curved monoliths, dressed and polished to veryhigh standards and in one case still jointed to a second block.Also protruding out of the slime and ooze on the sea-bed were carvedhemispherical stones, some up to a metre across, with circular holes drilledthrough their centres. These were thought to have been door sockets.And trapped amongst the rubble of ancient Dwarka there were still a number ofthree-holed triangular stone anchors that the NIO had not yet salvaged for thedisplay outside their offices. Identical anchors, Rao had told me, were known tohave been used in the Mediterranean by the merchant ships of Cyprus and Syria ataround 1400 BC and also in the Persian Gulf and at the nearby Indus-Sarasvatiport of Lothal.28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn28] Assuming the1400 BC date for this type of anchor to be generally valid, he regarded theirpresence at Dwarka as good circumstantial evidence in favour of his 1600 BC datefor the city. Certainly, they could only have been dropped here after the ruinshad been submerged deeply enough for boats to sail over them.But one mystery which began to nag at me on those first two dives, since we weresupposedly in the heart of the ancient city, was that there didn’t seem to beenough stone ruins here. This had nothing to do with the stark contrast betweenRao’s archaeological reconstructions of the antediluvian city and its actualappearance underwater today. What bothered me more was the almost equally starkcontrast with photographs that Rao had shown to me from his personal collectionthat tracked the NIO’s underwater excavations at the site from 1983 to 1994.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn29] Although some of the features inthose photographs were instantly recognizable on the sea-bed, many others werenowhere to be seen. Most notable by their absence were several partially intactwalls of large stone blocks, in some cases up to five courses high, in somecases showing right-angled corners where two walls joined, in some casesextending in straight lines away from the camera as far as the eye could see –and the visibility was far better in those early shots than the fog that I wasfinning around in now.So where were the missing walls?STORMSAfter I’d surfaced from the second dive and clambered back on board the boat Iasked Kamlesh this question and he signalled for Sundaresh and Anuruddh Gaur,two of the NIO’s senior marine archaeologists, to join us. A geologist bytraining, Kamlesh himself was not then a diver. Gaur and Sundaresh, on the otherhand, had been diving at Dwarka since the 1980s.Their answer was that the majority of the intact walls that had beenphotographed before 1994 either no longer existed or could not be relocated.Apparently, a series of severe monsoon storms during the past six years hadloosened and dislodged the great blocks and tumbled the walls over. Since thensedimentation and weed had covered up the debris which had been scattered over awide area by the monsoon swells.I remembered the section of fallen wall that I’d seen early on the first diveand thought no more about it. It was only much later that it struck me how oddit was that a site which had supposedly been submerged for more than threemillennia, and at which so many intact structural features had been documentedas recently as 1994, could have deteriorated so dramatically in just the lastsix years.THE ROCK-CUT WHARFSlightly dodgy-looking curries were available for lunch, cooked by the crew on akerosene stove in the cabin of the fishing boat and served out on a mixture ofplastic and tin plates. The wind had come up since the morning and wavelets werefreshening in the bay – not enough to stop us diving but potentially enough tostir up the bottom and worsen the visibility.I wasn’t feeling particularly well – headache, stiff-neck, nausea – and wasaware that I had been cold on the last dive, but I didn’t put the two together.I thought that what was making me ill was the exhaust gas from the diesel pumpthat the NIO had on board to provide air from the surface via long tubes totechnical divers working down below. A powerful air-lift system was alsooperating, sifting silt around the foundations of the ruins in the stillunsuccessful search for artefacts that could positively identify their period ofconstruction. All the vibrations and the fumes were a bit much for me but Ithought that I’d probably feel better when I got back in the water and couldbreathe the clean air from my tank.At this point the voice of reason told me it was time to put my wetsuit on forthe afternoon’s work and the voice of stupidity urged me not to bother. Thevoice of stupidity won.The dive we did that afternoon was with Gaur on the rock-hewn wharf at a depthof 12 metres about a kilometre out in the bay. Athough this was technicallystill a shallow dive, there was an oppressive darkness and gloom in the dirtygreen water and I began to feel more and more cold, weak and exhausted.We swam east on the seaward side of the ridge. As well as its rock-cut features,including what were presumed to have been holes for mooring-ropes drilledthrough it at several points, there were a number of hulking megaliths scatteredround about it on the sea-bed down to depths of about 18 metres. The officialview was that these were natural slabs that had become detached from the rockridge due to wave action when sea-level had been much lower – and perhaps evenbefore the wharf had been fashioned – but to my eye they looked in places asthough they had been dressed and cut.Quarter of an hour later, still heading east along the ridge, I saw a pattern ofother smaller blocks, like large tiles, laid out in a square grid amidst atangle of boulders. I went down to investigate and found that the regularpattern seemed to continue under the boulders. That was exciting. On the otherhand, up close, the little blocks and the joints between looked less regular,less man-made, than I had thought …I couldn’t make up my mind. And other ambiguous features along the ridge leftme, if anything, even more in doubt.WHITECAPS AND LENTIL SOUPI spent the next four days in bed in our dingy hotel room paying the price forbeing a fifty-year-old with no sense and mild hypothermia. A blinding, thuddingheadache was by far the worst of it and continued without any let-up for morethan seventy-two hours. I felt weak, shaky and couldn’t keep down anything Itried to eat.But I wasn’t missing much diving. The wind that had begun to pick up on thatfirst afternoon grew steadily stronger during the night, whipping the waves inthe bay into whitecaps, reducing the visibility to zero and making furtherdiving impossible. The NIO’s chartered boat headed back for the shelter of anearby fishing port and everyone waited to see if the weather would improve.By the time I dragged myself out of bed the wind had died down and the boat wasanchored over the ruins again. But the underwater conditions, with thetransparency of lentil soup, made it impossible to do any serious work. I trieda couple of dives at different locations on the site but could see nothing.Then the wind came up once more; this time with a forecast that it wouldcontinue to blow for more than a week, and it became obvious to all that therewould be no further diving that season.LAYER UPON LAYERHow old is the city beneath the waves?Sitting on the edge of the Gomati Ghat by the Temple of the Sea God on the lastevening of our stay in Dwarka, I looked over the agitated waters of thedarkening bay and tried to figure out the mystery.When I’d interviewed Rao at his home in Bangalore, I remembered that he’d toldme how he had first become involved with excavations at Dwarka more than twentyyears before. In his work for the Archaeological Survey of India he had arrangedthe demolition of a modern building that stood beside the main Dwarkadish(Krishna) temple, blocking the view:Rao: It was demolished. When we removed this structure we were surprised to finda temple below it – a temple of Vishnu. [Krishna is considered to be an avatar,or manifestation in human form, of the Vedic god Vishnu]30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn30] … It has beautiful sculptures andall that. We were surprised. You see this is a thirteenth-to fifteenth-centurytemple, the present one that we visit, but here is a ninth-century temple. Howis it? When we dug for that we got two more temples below – below that there aretwo more temples.GH: So it’s as though the existing Dwarkadish temple was built on top of anolder temple?Rao: Not the existing one. The one just by the side of it. You see, actually,this temple, I mean the existing one, must have been built on top of an ancientone, because what we got is a small shrine, and the other shrine must be belowthe present temple.GH: But your excavation was beside the existing temple and there underneath youfound earlier layers?Rao: Earlier layers. And further when we dug we came across a clear sectionshowing erosion by sea, with pottery and other datable objects of about 1500 BC.So between 1500 BC and 1500 AD there must have been continuous occupation hereof which we hardly know anything. But again sometime there is divine help forus. One professor by name of B. R. Rao, a geologist, had come to Dwarka toinspect the site for a proposed university. I showed him the section and he saidyes, this is clear evidence for erosion by the sea. I showed him the pottery andhe said there must have been a township near by. He said, what will you do? Isaid we have to excavate in the sea – that’s marine archaeology.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn31]Rao then successfully arranged government funding for his proposed venture atDwarka:But we did not know how to start the work. We had hardly any experience ofmarine archaeology. Then I thought what we should do now is take a bold step …Where to look for the structures was the question. Fortunately, there is thetemple of Samudra Narayana, the sea god. So I said people have been making someofferings here. Maybe ancient times also there may have been some structurethere and offerings might have been made. So we straight away started lookingthere. And then within a few days we got evidence of the structural remainsthere, underwater.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn32]AN EARLIER TOWNLooking over the bay from the Samudra Narayana temple I reflected on Rao’sdating of the underwater ruins to the second millennium BC and the ‘lateHarappan’ period. I could see no reasons why the scattered structural remainsthat I had dived on should be any older than that – and even some to suspectthat they might be younger, perhaps much younger. Except for the rock-hewnwharf, which itself was not particularly deep, most of the structures were inshallow water of 7 metres or less and might easily have been submergedrelatively recently in land-subsidence caused by the immense earthquakes thatperiodically afflict Gujerat.33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn33]Besides, what I’d seen of the underwater ruins looked nothing like any of the‘late Harappan’ settlements I knew of; on the contrary, the distinctive curvedbastions and general style of the architectural blocks on the sea-bed lookedmuch more like medieval Indian construction work than anything to do with theIndus-Sarasvati civilization.But what intrigued me, and what Rao had been entirely open to, was thepossibility that there might be other ruins further out to sea which the NIO hadnot yet found – indeed had not yet even looked for. Rao also reminded me thatthe ancient texts that seemed to have correctly predicted the presence of theunderwater ruins that he had discovered also predict that other older ruinsshould exist in the vicinity – for Krishna was said to have built Dwarka on thesite of an even earlier city called Kususthali:In fact I used to read the Mahabaratha and also other Puranas like Vishnu Puranaand others, where it is clearly states that Dwarka was built at Kususthali insuch a way that it was surrounded by the sea … So Krishna comes to Kususthaliand then builds a town and calls it Dwarka and there existed an earlier townbefore Dwarka was built …What is striking about the story of Krishna’s city being built above an earliercity is the way it resonates with the firm evidence we already have from Rao’sexcavations around the Dwarkadish temple – revealing layers and layers ofearlier constructions beneath it and around it, going back to a stratum ataround 1500 BC that is roughly parallel to modern sea-level. The ruins that Raothen found underwater should, as he reasons, belong to the time-periodimmediately before 1500 BC – say 1700 to 1800 BC at the earliest – suggestingthat the city that today clusters around the Dwarkadish temple and down toGomati Ghat is where it is because it replaces the earlier city that liessubmerged in the bay beneath it.And that city in turn – the city of Krishna – is where it is, the legends say,because of the earlier city of Kususthali:GH: Is there a sense in the ancient texts that there had been a sacred centre atDwarka in the remote past, a long time ago? Or was it absolutely newlyestablished by Krishna?Rao: Well, you see, it says that [an ancestor of Krishna] had built that townKususthali and he went to Brahamaloka [a higher world]. So some connection withmythology and all that is already there when Krishna comes to that place. So theearlier township had some sanctity about it …In an epoch of rising sea-levels the obvious place to rebuild and reconsecrate asubmerged shrine or sacred centre would be on the nearest area of coast stillabove water. When the new shrine was inundated in its turn it would have to bere-established on higher ground – and so on. So maybe this is what we’re seeingat Dwarka: Krishna’s Dwarka was built to replace the antediluvian sacred centrethat the texts call Kususthali – and when Krishna’s Dwarka was inundated, modernDwarka was built to replace it. By inference, if we keep looking further out tosea, beyond what’s left of Krishna’s Dwarka – if it really is Krishna’s Dwarka,as Rao believes – then we should find older, more deeply submerged ruins.3102 BCBut are the underwater ruins that Rao discovered at Dwarka the remains of‘Krishna’s city’ – or of something else?As I sat there overlooking the darkening waves, with the heady aroma of sacredganja being exhaled all around me by the orange-robed sadhus who’d gathered towatch the sunset from Samudra Narayana, I remembered feeling that Rao couldn’thave it both ways. He couldn’t have his underwater ruins dating archaeologicallyto around 1800 or 1700 BC on the one hand and claim on the other that they werethe ruins of Krishna’s city – since, apart from one minor variant tradition,Krishna is universally believed in India to have died at a date equivalent to3102 BC.34 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-ftn34] This date (see chapter4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04]) also marks the onset of the KaliYuga.But Rao wasn’t trying to have it both ways:GH: Another question concerning Krishna. The departure, or death, of Krishna’sincarnation, if I understand correctly, is taken as the end of a previous age,of a yuga, and the beginning of the Kali Yuga. Now in many calculations thatI’ve seen – numerous calculations – they all seem to point the beginning of theKali Yuga to 3100 BC approximately.Rao: Correct.GH: Do you regard that as an impossible date? Because you seem to focus on amuch later date, in the second millennium BC, for the submerged Dwarka.Rao: Well, I wouldn’t call it an impossible date. But what evidence we have gotso far shows that about 1700 or 1800 BC, by that time this township that is nowunderwater must have been built. Now if so, how is that date wrong? I mean, the3100 BC date. We have discussed this matter in a journal where we said thatmaybe we are yet to find some more antiquities of the same township … So wecan’t discard the earlier date totally.But if the underwater ruins already excavated do really date back to 1700 or1800 BC, then where is the logical place to search for ruins even older thanthat – the ruins of the city said to have been engulfed by a great flood at thebeginning of the Kali Yuga in 3102 BC?FURTHER OUT, IN DEEPER WATERThe connection of the death of Krishna and the submergence of Dwarka to theonset of the Kali Yuga is a powerful and widespread tradition in India, as isthe connection of the Kali Yuga to a start date of 3102 BC.We know that the city called Dwarka today is built on a mound made up ofcontinuous occupation strata going down to present sea-level at 1500 BC and with‘a clear section showing erosion by sea’ in the lowest stratum – indicative of amarine incursion (perhaps a tidal wave?) at that date.We know that ruins have been found under that level beneath the sea andprovisionally dated to 1800–1600 BC, though a more recent date is also possible.These ruins extend up to approximately 1 kilometre from the shore.Therefore, it follows, if we wish to search for the ruins of 3100 BC and earlierthat are hinted at in the traditions, that we are going to have to look furtherout, in deeper water.In March 2000 I still didn’t have Glenn Milne’s inundation maps and imaginedthat Gujerat’s Ice Age coastline might have extended 5 or at the most 10kilometres beyond the modern shoreline of Dwarka. In fact, as the maps show,Dwarka was almost 100 kilometres from the sea 16,400 years ago when it was partof a vast antediluvian landmass around Gujerat that filled in the Gulfs of Kutchand Cambay – and was still 20 kilometres inland as late as 10,600 years ago,just after the rapid rise in sea-level attested in the deep-sea cores between10,000 and 9000 BC and the sudden appearance of village farming communitiesalong the piedmont of the Himalayas.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_043_r1.jpg]If anywhere in the world looks like a potential ‘nucleus region’, or ‘Ice Agerefugium’, out of which the first settlers of Mehrgarh and the other ‘aceramicNeolithic’ food-producing settlements in north-west India might have sprung,then, surely, this is it? And doesn’t it make sense that the descendants ofthose first settlers, who went on, in time, to create the Indus-Sarasvaticivilization, might have continued to revere sacred coastal sites and to rebuildthem further inland whenever the sea-level rose?THE MYSTERY OF THE U-SHAPED STRUCTUREThat night, over a farewell dinner with the NIO team, I produced the Journal ofMarine Archaeology given to me by Kamlesh and opened it at the report on theunderwater explorations off Poompuhur in the south-east – about as far away fromDwarka as it is possible to get and still remain in India. Both Sundaresh andGaur had participated in the 1993 Poompuhur expedition and had co-authored thereport with S. R. Rao. Now was my chance to quiz them about the anomalousU-shaped structure that they had found 5 kilometres from the shore and 23 metresdeep and to launch the idea of mounting a further expedition with them toPoompuhur at some time in the future.We began by discussing the less controversial – and for me less interesting –ruins of Kaveripumpattinam in the intertidal zone and the shallows down to 3metres. These, Sundaresh and Gaur concurred, were in the range of 2000 yearsold, and I had no reason to doubt them.‘OK,’ I said, ‘so let’s accept that dating for the inshore structures. Then whatdo you find as the water gets deeper?’They told me that their survey had identified fairly extensive structuralremains in the form of heavily eroded and scattered dressed sandstone blocksdown to a depth of about 7 metres. At the same depth they had also locatedseveral curious circular cairns, some 10 metres in diameter, made up of roundedstones and some small upright stones. Nothing was seen deeper than 8 metresuntil the U-shaped structure and its neighbouring mounds suddenly appeared at 23metres.‘Don’t you think that’s odd?’ I asked.Sundaresh and Gaur agreed that it was indeed odd since it suggested that thedate of submergence of the U-shaped structure must be much earlier than the dateof submergence of the structures inshore.‘How much earlier?’‘Maybe 8000 years earlier,’ said Gaur after a moment’s thought.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_044_r1.jpg]Position of various submerged structures off Poompuhur coast. Based on Rao etal. (1993).‘So if the Kaveripumpattinam structures in 1–3 metres are 2000 years old thenwhat you’re saying is that the U-shaped structure might be 10,000 years old?’‘I’m saying it would have been submerged by the rising sea-level about 10,000years ago – maybe even before that. But I think it must be some sort of naturaloutcrop.’I was genuinely puzzled. ‘Everyone else who has dived on it seems convinced it’sman-made. Courses of masonry were seen on it. That’s in this report’ – I pointedat the Journal of Marine Archaeology – ‘which you co-authored by the way.’Gaur laughed: ‘Yes, but I have my own view and the more I think about it themore I am convinced it must be natural.’‘But why? What are your reasons?’‘Because it is a huge structure and we know that there was no culture anywherein India at that time capable of mobilizing the necessary resources andorganizing the necessary labour to build something so big.’‘That’s just classic old-school historical chauvinism,’ I complained. ‘It’s asthough you’re saying, “We archaeologists know everything about the past and wewon’t let a few contradictory facts get in our way.”’‘It is a fact! We don’t know of any culture 10,000 years ago that could havebuilt this structure.’‘But maybe it was the work of a culture that you don’t know about yet. Maybethis U-shaped structure, whatever it is, is the first concrete evidence for theexistence of that culture. Maybe if you look you’ll find even more structures,even further out, in deeper water.’Sundaresh chipped in at this point that he did not agree with Gaur. In hisopinion, he said, the U-shaped structure was not a natural outcrop: ‘It isdefinitely man-made. And I have seen a second structure, a mound, about 45metres away at the same depth where there are perfect cut blocks scattered onthe sea-bed …’‘But what about the 10,000-year-old date?’‘Maybe the structures are not that old at all. Maybe there has been some greatland subsidence here that we do not know of, or erosion of the coast by thesea.’It was obvious that the only way to find out, and to settle the mystery, was bydoing more diving and by careful measurement, observation and excavation of thesite. But the problem was that since 1993 no funding had been available for afurther expedition.‘So you have no plans to dive at Poompuhur in the coming year?’ I asked.‘Rather you should say no budget,’ Kamlesh intervened dolefully. ‘If somebodywill finance us to go – only then can we go.’I bit the bullet. ‘So what would it take to finance your team to go back thereand dive on the site with me later this year or early next year – a sort ofspecial charter, so to speak? Is it even possible to do something like thatwithin the NIO’s regulations?’‘Now that the SRC already know of you it should be possible,’ said Kamlesh. ‘Idon’t see why not.’He spent the next three minutes doing calculations on the back of a napkin andfinally quoted me a sum equivalent to the gross national product of a smallEuropean country.I gulped but steadied my nerves. It was going to be a long negotiation."},{"pageContent":"10 / THE MYSTERY OF THE RED HILLThe ground near it is not at all touched by the four oceans that become agitatedat the close of the Yuga and that have the extremities of the worlds submergedin them … When the annihilation of all living beings takes place, when allcreated things are reabsorbed … all the future seeds are certainly depositedthere … All the lores, arts, wealth of scriptures, and the Vedas are truthfullywell-arranged there … Brahmanas who resort to the foot of that mountain arecalled by me after the deluge and I make them study the Vedas and makecollections thereof …Skanda PuranaFEBRUARY 2000, SOUTH INDIASince 5 a.m., Santha and I had been climbing the winding track towards the rocky800 metre summit of Arunachela, the sacred mountain of Tamil Nadu. It was nowjust after 6 a.m. and dawn had not yet broken. Except for the sound of ourfootfalls and distant cockcrows, everything was silent, everything still. Thenwe rounded a corner and the streetlights of Tiruvannamalai, the burgeoning townthat clusters at the foot of the mountain, came suddenly into view beneath us.In its midst, due east of us, there lay a huge geometrical pool of deep darknessand shadow, like a giant doorway to another world. This place, where no lightsyet burned, marked the precincts of Arunacheleswar, one of the five mostimportant temples of Siva in all of India.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn1] We found a ledge of rock to sit onand waited for the sun to rise …After being drawn in by the charisma and magnetism of the ‘proto-Siva’ figure onthe Mohenjodaro seal I began to realize that Siva is everywhere in India. Evenin Dwarka, with its all-pervasive cult of Krishna, there is also a beautifulSiva temple. Yet the devotees of the yogic god are most numerous and mostdemonstrative in the south, amongst the Dravidian-speaking peoples of TamilNadu, and Tiruvannamalai is one of the true centres of his cult.Very little in Hinduism is straightforward or exactly what it seems: identitieschange and merge, contradictions abound, one thing stands for another, gods maymanifest in different ways at the same time, ambiguity is everywhere. All thisis there in the ancient story of Siva’s great temple at Arunachela:The Supreme Being, the Ocean of Grace, Lord Siva once had a desire – ‘Let mebecome many.’ In accordance with this desire, Brahma and Vishnu came intoexistence spontaneously. They were delegated the duty of creating the worlds andprotecting them. However, instead of merely carrying out the duty ordained bythe Lord, they were caught up in an argument out of egoism which resulted in amajor conflict. Seeing the terrible rage they had fallen into while battlingwith each other, the Lord of Compassion deemed it fit to reveal Himself in aform that would put an end to their fighting.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn2][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_045_r1.jpg]To cut a long story short, Siva revealed himself on the spot where Arunachelanow stands in the form of a limitless column of blazing light and scorching firepiercing the sky and pervading the universe. On seeing this dazzling andfearsome vision Brahma and Vishnu were not humbled but entered into a newcompetition to discover ‘either the beginning or the end’ of the column.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn3] Only when both had provedthemselves incapable of doing so did Siva at last emerge from the effulgence.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn4]There are a few other twists and turns in the story, but the upshot is that Sivaforgives Brahma and Vishnu for their contentions, telling them: ‘Carry onvigilantly with your work of creation and sustenance without forgetting me.’5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn5] He then announces that theeffulgent column will remain eternally manifest on this spot in the form of amountain of fire:My Effulgent form will shine here forever as eternal, immutable Arunachela.Oceans will not submerge it even at the time of the great Deluge. The winds willnot shake it and the world-destroying fire will not burn it.On hearing these words Brahma and Vishnu humbly bowed down to Siva and prayed:‘Sustainer of the Universe! Let this Hill be the mainstay of the world as statedby you. But moderate its Effulgence, O Rudra, so that it becomes bearable, yetretains its boundless glory and remains a repository of everything auspicious.’6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn6]In answer to Brahma and Vishnu’s prayers, ‘Siva reduced the blinding effulgenceof his shining appearance in the column by transforming himself into thislacklustre mountain’7 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn7] – the ‘RedHill’ of Arunachela, of which it is said: ‘Just as we identify ourselves withour body, Lord Siva identifies himself with this Hill where the reddish colourof the rocks suggests the primeval fire.’8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn8] In addition Brahma and Vishnubeseeched Siva:Although this Red Hill exists for the welfare of all, none could worship itwithout your grace … [Therefore] we request you also to take the form of aLingam on the East side of the Mountain so that we may worship you …9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn9]Again Shiva complied and a miraculous column of stone – the Sivalinga, orphallic symbol of Siva – appeared at the foot of the mountain on its easternside. As a token of gratitude Brahma and Vishnu commanded Visvakarma, thearchitect of the gods, to erect a temple around it – the primordial temple ofArunacheleswar.The temple that now stands on the site is of more recent origin. But believersmaintain that it is the original natural stone lingam, ‘self-generated’ at thebeginning of time, that still resides in the Holy of Holies and continues to bevenerated by millions of pilgrims as the sign and the seal of Siva’s presence onearth.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn10]AUSTERITIESWe watched the sun come up in the south-east, illuminating first the ninepyramidal gopurams that surround the temple complex and then the deeper shadowsin the interested rectangles of its plazas, ambulatories and shrines. As thetown’s streetlights faded out in the rising glare of the day we could see thatbeyond the temple was a plain extending to the horizon in a great arc beneathus, its flatness broken here and there by isolated conical hills.We resumed our climb of Arunachela. Although it is not particularly high, theway is steep and the winding path is long. After another hour had passed westill seemed to be nowhere near the summit, the sun was much hotter, and I wasbeginning to regret bringing only one bottle of water. Santha and I paused totake a swig each, looking down the way we had come to the distant towers ofArunacheleswar. Rising out of the morning haze the temple possessed an epic,otherworldly quality and it was not difficult to imagine it in the way that theancient traditions describe it – as the work of the gods themselves, built atthe dawn of the present cycle of time.We started climbing again and when we next looked up we saw a lean but muscularyoung man, with the long tangled hair, ash-smeared forehead and orangeloin-cloth of a sadhu, sitting cross-legged on a rock on the slope above us. Heseemed oblivious to our presence but when Santha said good morning to him inTamil his reply was friendly enough.We passed him and continued to climb. When I glanced back a few moments later Isaw that he was no longer seated on the rock but following immediately behind,barefooted and silent. Now, effortlessly, he increased his pace and overtook usand soon he had disappeared round a twist in the path ahead, shielded from us bypiles of fallen boulders.I guessed that he must be one of the devotees of Narayana Swami, the almostlegendary figure I was hoping to encounter, who was reputed to have remainednear the summit of Arunachela for the previous ten years, consuming no solidfood of any kind and subsisting exclusively on small quantities of milk and teabrought to him by his acolytes.By the performance of such austerities [tapas], which may range from relativelypleasant tasks like prolonged sexual intercourse without ejaculation torelatively unpleasant ones like holding one’s arm permanently above one’s headfor decades, great yogis like Narayana Swami are believed to build up a specialpower of supernatural ‘heat’:The basic transformation brought about by the Rishi in his performance of tapasis the production of heat in the body. The fire of his tapas becomes such thatit is transformed into Fire itself, burning the worlds with his heat andilluminating them with the light that radiates from his body … Powers ofbecoming invisible, walking on water and flying through the air are among thosemost frequently said to be obtained by performing tapas-, while in theYoga-sutras, a large number of such powers are listed as being attained throughthe practice of yoga – including, in addition to such ‘physical’ powers, varioustypes of mental knowledge such as of previous existences and of the thoughts ofothers …11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn11]The intense physical and mental discipline that tapas requires is also anessential step on the road to liberation from death. Thus, through theirfearsome austerities, the Seven Rishis of the Vedas were said to have possessedpowers of rejuvenation, of curing illnesses, and of restoring the dead to life …One of the aims of the Rsis in performing tapas was to attain to the realm ofthe immortals and to obtain immortality – even as it is said that the gods anddemons themselves performed tapas in order to escape death.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn12]John E. Mitchiner, the expert on the traditions of the Seven Rishis, admits that‘such powers are indeed attributed to the Rsis throughout Indian literature’.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn13]But the question is why? Why the consistent association, throughout history, ofgreat rishis with these extraordinary powers, and why do they always use thesame means – yoga, austerity, meditation – in order to develop them? Is it alljust imagination and fantasy on the part of the ancient storytellers? Or is itpossible that something substantial lies behind these traditions?I did not expect Narayana Swami to tell me the answer but I was neverthelesscurious to set eyes on anyone who could live on tea and milk at the top of amountain for ten years. I was also intrigued by the way that his presence thereappeared to symbolize or bear out another tradition, recorded in a Tamil textknown as the Arunachela Mahamatmyam (‘Glory of Arunachela’) to the effect thatSiva himself always sits beneath a tree near the summit of the mountain in theguise of a siddha:Siva abides here forever as a siddha known as Arunagiri Yogi, wearing only aloin-cloth and with matted locks and forehead shining with marks of vibhuti.[sacred ash].14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn14]Because I had gradually acclimatized myself to such material over many months, Inow had no difficulty in understanding how Siva could, at one and the sameinstant, be a phallic stone column in the Holy of Holies of the temple at thefoot of the mountain, an ascetic meditating under a tree at the top of themountain, and the mountain itself – for it is said that ‘unlike other mountains,which have become holy because the Lord dwells in them [e.g. Kailas in theHimalayas], Arunachela is Lord Siva himself’.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn15]MAINSTAY OF THE WORLDIn the north Indian tradition of the flood we hear that Manu and the Seven Sagestook refuge in the Himalayas and that it was from there that they spread out tore-establish agriculture and to repromulgate the Vedas in the ‘Land of the SevenRivers’ between the Indus and the Ganges. For south India, a Tamil traditionrecorded in the Skanda Purana assigns the same role – as a place of refuge fromthe flood and as a centre of subsequent teaching – to Arunachela, foreverprotected by Siva’s guarantee that ‘oceans will not submerge it even at the timeof the great deluge’:16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn16]The ground near it is not at all touched by the four oceans that become agitatedat the close of the Yuga and that have the extremities of the worlds submergedin them … When the annihilation of all living beings takes place, when allcreated things are reabsorbed … all the future seeds are certainly depositedthere … All the lores, arts, wealth of scriptures, and the Vedas are truthfullywell-arranged there … Brahmanas who resort to the foot of that mountain arecalled by me after the deluge and I make them study the Vedas and makecollections thereof … Sages of well-praised holy observances and rites, whoabide within the caves of that mountain, shine with their matted hair. They havethe refulgence of 100,000 suns and fires …17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn17]The Puranas also tell us that the Seven Sages (normally associated with thepost-diluvial preservation of the Vedas in the Himalayas) were amongst those whovisited Arunachela.18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn18] And it wasundoubtedly the case, I reflected, as Santha and I continued our climb – passingnow through a zone of cooling mist and then entering a dark defile – that thisred-granite mountain, which in fact belongs to one of the oldest exposed rockformations on earth,19 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn19] wouldnever have been flooded during the post-glacial meltdown. Even during the worstevents, the great tidal waves would not have reached this far inland or thishigh.So Arunachela might well have been perceived as a solid and reliable ‘mainstayof the world’ in a time of rapidly and unpredictably rising sea-levels aroundthe coasts of southern India. How interesting, therefore, that it wasremembered, like the Himalayas in the distant north, as a place where ‘all thefuture seeds’ were deposited for the later benefit of mankind, and as a refugefor sages where the ancient wisdoms of the Vedas were kept safe and from whencethey were later repromulgated.MASTER OF ALL WISDOMSiva is a god of many dimensions and he has been present in India – all of India– for a very long while. We’ve seen that his form as a meditating sadhu, lean,naked, powerful, the Lord of Yoga, goes back at the very least to the Pasupatiseals of Indus-Sarasvati times, 4700 years ago. The same is true of hismanifestation as a phallic cone or column of stone – many examples of which havebeen excavated in Indus-Sarasvati sites.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn20] He is also one of the primevalgods of the Rig Veda, where he is known as Rudra. It is in recognition of thisancestry that the names Siva and Rudra are used interchangeably (or jointly as‘Rudra-Siva’) in many ancient Indian scriptures.21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn21] And Rudra is addressed as followsin the Yajur Veda: ‘Thou art Siva [gracious, kind] by name.’22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn22]Like Siva, Rudra is both terrifying and reassuring.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn23] He is said to have ‘two naturesor two “names”: the one, cruel and wild (rudra), the other kind (siva) andtranquil (santa)’.24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn24]Like Siva, Rudra is the ‘dweller in the mountain’,25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn25] ‘the blue throated one’,26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn26] and ‘Tryambaka’ (‘thethree-eyed’).27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn27] Like Siva, Rudraof the Vedas has a fair or white complexion28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn28] (but is also sometimes describedas ‘red’29 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn29]), and is a great Yogiand the Lord of Animals.30 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn30] LikeSiva, Rudra has long, braided and/or matted hair, and healing powers.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn31] Like Siva, Rudra is associatedwith fire.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn32] And like Siva,Rudra’s symbol in later Vedic tradition is sthanu, ‘a post’ or ‘a pillar’signifying ‘the timeless, motionless state of samadhi in which the Lord of Yogadwells’.33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn33]But above and beyond any of this, the true defining characteristic of Rudra-Sivais as the God of all Knowledge and of insight and inner wisdom (jnana – gnosis).This is why we read, in Book VIII of the Rig Veda: ‘That mind of Rudra, freshand strong, moves conscious in the ancient ways.’34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn34]This is why Siva is frequently portrayed in Hindu religious art asJnana-Dakshinamurti, Master of all Wisdom, ‘sitting under a tree on MountKailasa with his foot on a dwarf who symbolizes human ignorance’.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn35]THE HIGHEST KNOWLEDGE TO THE MOST HUMBLEThe particular nature of Rudra-Siva as the God of Knowledge in the form of apowerful rishi with unkempt hair who lives in mountains and wild places isconnected to a subtle and complex system of ideas which, even if one does notagree with it, must be admitted to be extremely well thought-out and (in view ofthe Mohenjodaro seal) extremely ancient. Ultimately, it seems to state thatenlightenment, and true knowledge, cannot be attained without becoming themaster of one’s impulses and renouncing the lures of the material world – or atany rate one’s ‘attachment’ to it. Conversely, a person’s material wealth andphysical beauty can tell us nothing useful about that person’s mind and soul. Itis to drive this point home, perhaps, that when the gods come to seek advicefrom Siva they find him ‘accompanied by myriads of devoted followers, all ofthem naked, all deformed, with tangled curly hair’.36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn36]Likewise the Orientalist Alain Danielou observes that:Already the Vedas picture Rudra as living in the forests and mountains, rulingover animals tamed and wild. The Saiva mythology shows him as the divinity oflife, the guardian of the earth, who wanders naked through rich forests, lustfuland strong. He teaches the highest and most secret knowledge to the mosthumble.37 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn37]The idea that true wisdom does not clothe itself in finery is also conveyed inanother story of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, where Brahma and Vishnu are once againcontending as to which one of them is the supreme being:Thus Vishnu and Brahma disputed, and at length they agreed to allow the matterto be decided by the Vedas. The Vedas declared that Siva was the creator,preserver, destroyer. Having heard these words, Vishnu and Brahma, stillbewildered by the darkness of delusion, said, ‘How can the lord of goblins, thedelighter in graveyards, the naked devotee covered with ashes, haggard inappearance, wearing twisted locks ornamented with snakes, be the supremebeing?’38 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn38]The answer, since Rudra-Siva is in fact the supreme being, is that he can takeany form he chooses. And it is his choice that leads him to smear himself withashes and consort with the poor and humble who are pure in spirit. According toProfessor Stella Kamrisch:He stood apart and was an outsider to other Vedic gods. He could be recognizedby his weird, mad looks. He seemed poor and uncared for, neglectful of hisappearance; the gods despised him, but he intentionally courted dishonour, herejoiced in contempt and disregard, for ‘he who is despised lies happy, freed ofall attachment’. The fierce, self-humiliated Lord was a yogi … He provokedcontempt as a test of his detachment.39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn39]So there is an idea here, a fairly consistent idea – perhaps it is better to saya system of ideas – behind the conception of Rudra-Siva as the God of Knowledge.Whatever knowledge and powers he possesses have been acquired throughmeditation, austerity and self-sacrifice – practices that are likely to havebeen part of a wider curriculum. And the same is true, unconditionally, of theSeven Rishis of the Vedas. They also, John Mitchiner observes,smother their bodies with ashes, and have their hair uncut, matted and tied in aknot: in other words they are depicted as being in appearance much as many other– especially Saiva – ascetics.40 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn40]There is even a tradition in the Bhagvata Purana that the greatest sages ‘rangeover the world in the guise of mad persons’ whilst imparting wisdom.41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn41]At the very least the lesson of this is that it is worth showing respect andlistening carefully to the words of any person. Appearances can be deceptive andyou never know who you’re dealing with.In such a spirit I hoisted my weary body up the last few metres of Arunachela’scrumbling granite scree and on to the muddy path overlooked by sloping rocksthat led to Narayana Swami’s mountain-top lair.TEA AND PRAYERSThe rishi did not occupy the summit of the mountain – he would have been roastedby the sacred fire that is lit there every December to mark the apotheosis ofSiva as a column of flame – but had set up his hermitage in a tree-lined bowerthat lay off to one side a few minutes’ walk below the summit. He was attendedby the young man who had passed us earlier on our climb, and four other Sivaascetics (Sivachariars) clad in orange rags, who now peered down from the rocksand greeted us from either side of the muddy path.Suddenly, as soon as we’d arrived, we found ourselves in the middle of some sortof ceremony or routine. The young acolytes indicated that we should take off ourshoes – because we were now approaching holy ground – and beckoned to us toaccompany them down a little incline to the edge of the bower where NarayanaSwami had presumably been sitting for the past ten years. In the shady gloom,buzzing with enormous hornets, we could just make out a little half-tent, like arefugee lean-to covered in plastic, underneath the overgrowing branches of thetrees.We never actually did get to see the rishi, this embodiment of Siva, face toface, let alone speak to him. He didn’t speak to anyone, at least not in anyknown language, although he did mumble and grunt incoherently to his followersfrom time to time and they seemed to understand. The most we saw was a thin butstrong arm with leathery skin reaching out sometimes, and a bony finger makingpatterns in the mud in front of the little plastic tent – and there was a greatdeal of mud around the rishi’s bower and pools of water lying in the hollows ofthe rocks.Next we had to sit down in the mud and the acolytes brought us dirtyhalf-coconut shells of what they announced to be tea that had been blessed bythe rishi. Into this tea, which was lukewarm, they melted finger-sized dollopsof butter and asked us to drink. We did so, with some trepidation (I wasthinking amoebas, right from the start). Then there were prayers, reminding usthat the tea had been blessed and that it would make us well in our bodies. Thenmore tea and more prayers. Then we were brought a cold, but somehow greasy,herbal drink with leaves floating in it – also blessed by the rishi. We drankit. More prayers followed, and more tea with butter and intestinal parasites.After that one of the acolytes beckoned to us to line up behind him and led usin a clockwise direction on a brisk walking circuit (with each circuit requiringonly twenty or thirty seconds to complete) of the path that runs around theinside of the bower and in front of Narayana Swami’s shelter. There we kneltdown in the mud and sacred ash was placed on our foreheads. Then we completed afew more circuits chanting as we went ‘Siva, Siva, Siva, Raga Ra, Raga Ra’ – orsomething like that.It was very strange. We didn’t ask for the ceremony and – most unusually inIndia – no money was required of us for participating in it.ARUNACHELA AND KUMARI RANDOMWas Narayana Swami genuinely mad, I wondered, as we made our way down Arunachelathat afternoon. Or was he one of those great rishis, lit with the inner fire oftapas, said to roam the world disguised as a madman whilst imparting knowledge?To believe him to be wise if he was in fact mad would be the height ofgullibility, but to believe him to be mad if he was in fact wise might be aneven bigger mistake. Besides, whatever he was, his presence testified to thecontinuing vitality of the pan-Indian tradition that mountains such as this onehad served as centres for the collection and repromulgation of the Vedas afterthe flood and as places where a brotherhood of ascetics preserved antediluvianknowledge that would be used to plant ‘the seeds of the future’.Setting aside for a moment its connection with Rudra-Siva, the Yogic god ofwisdom, I felt that I needed more information on this ‘flood’ aspect of theArunachela story. Specifically, I wanted to find out if was connected in any wayto the mysterious lost land called Kumari Kandam that was said to have beenswallowed up by the sea around south India thousands of years before. By thetime Santha and I reached Tiruvannamalai in February 2000 I was already familiarwith some details of this tradition – which is widely known amongst India’s 200million Tamils but almost unheard-of outside India. I now hoped to learn morefrom a Tamil pundit whom I had arranged to meet after our climb. A retiredship’s captain who had given himself over to the life of contemplation, he nowresided permanently at the Ashram of Sri Ramana Maharishi, which is positionedat the foot of Arunachela about 2 kilometres from the Arunacheles-war temple.A LOIN-CLOTH, A WATER-POT AND A WALKING STICKMaharishi means ‘great rishi’ and Sri Ramana seems in every way to qualify forthis title. Like Naryana Swami, he had at one stage of his life exposed himselffor several years on the slopes of Arunachela after first arriving there in1896. At the time, it is recorded, Sri Ramanawas completely oblivious to his body and the world; insects chewed away portionsof his legs, his body wasted away because he was rarely conscious enough to eat,and his hair and fingernails grew to unmanageable lengths.42[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn42]This fugue had been brought on by a flash of spiritual insight that the realnature of the human creature is ‘formless, immanent consciousness’.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn43] After two or three years in thisstate Sri Ramana ‘began a slow return to physical normality, a process that wasnot finally completed for several years’.44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn44] During this period followersbegan to gather about him and by the time of his death in 1950he was widely regarded as India’s most popular and revered holy man … He madehimself available to visitors twenty-four hours a day by living and sleeping ina communal hall which was always accessible to everyone, and his only privatepossessions were a loin-cloth, a water-pot and a walking stick.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn45]Since Sri Ramana’s death his Ashram has continued to attract devotees and is athriving, busy place today with a good library, extensive offices, private andcommunal accommodation, a canteen and a beautiful prayer hall. The pundit I hadcome to meet, Captain A. Naryan (no relation to Naryana Swami), was a tall,heavy-set moustachioed man in his early seventies, who explained to me that hewas no great scholar, but that he had a personal interest in Tamil traditionswhich he had been able to pursue since his retirement, and that he hoped hissmall knowledge might provide me with a few clues for my search. ‘Everyone callsme Captain,’ he said, when I asked how I should address him.AS OLD AS THE HILLSWe began by talking through the story of Arunachela and how it was said that themountain would never be submerged or swept away – even by the waters of thegreat deluge at the end of a world age. ‘So we may assume that this has been thecase in the past?’ I was half asking, half affirming ‘because there is adestruction at the end of each cycle of yugas, so somehow Arunachela hasremained constant throughout all of this?’The Captain nodded sagely.‘So it is the centre of everything,’ I continued. ‘Now the area which I’m tryingto explore is the borderland between history and what comes before history. Andwe know that, historically, the temple here at Arunachela, there are documentswhich speak of its construction, and probably the temple as we see it now, mostof it is less than 1000 years old and some parts may go back closer to 2000years old, but at the heart of it is the Sivalingam, which is said to be mucholder. Can you tell me a bit about that lingam – which is supposed to be“self-created”? What does this mean?’‘ “Self-created”,’ replied Narayan, ‘means it is not chiselled by man in the waythat other lingas are chiselled by man. But there are certain other lingas whichcome out of the earth, not made by man, but which conform to all thecharacteristics – like the proportion, the width, the circumference and theheight. So just like a man-made Sivalinga it conforms to the correctproportions.’‘So it would look like a man-made one, but it’s not?’‘It is not!’ affirmed the Captain. ‘It is more perfect. And it must be as old asArunachela itself. Because as the Purana says, when the primal gods werebeseeching the supreme being: “Since the mortals cannot see you in youreffulgence form, you should take the form of a lacklustre hill. Even if youassume the form of a lacklustre hill, only the clouds can anoint you and onlythe sun and the moon can be the lamps lit for you. But we have to do puja[prayers, offerings] before you so you should assume the form of a smallerlingam.” So Arunachela granted their wish and he told them I will appear in theform of a lingam and you may worship me …’‘And that is the lingam that’s in the temple?’‘That is the lingam.’‘OK, fair enough. A naturally formed lingam that’s literally as old as thehills. But at some point human beings must have found it, begun to treat it as acult object, and built some sort of structure around it. What I’m trying to getat is when did the anointing and worship of this naturally formed lingam begin?It’s presumably much earlier than the date of construction of the temple that’sstanding on the site today?’‘Yes. Yes, naturally. What the Puranas say is that gods came here and they werethe first to build a temple around the self-generated lingam of the Lord. That’swhat the Puranas say. The primal gods Brahma and Vishnu built the temple, andcities were created by the heavenly builder Visvakarma around this place, aroundArunachela.’CITIES OF THE GODSI was already familiar with the origin myth of Arunachela as it is told in theTamil Puranas46 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn46] and knew that itwas like many other tales from around the world of cities and temples built bygods.47 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn47] Frequently – as in thecase of the Edfu Building Texts of ancient Egypt, for example – such traditionstell us that the gods embarked on these works of construction at carefullychosen locations on earth in the aftermath of a global cataclysm, typically aflood.48 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn48] This is not what thePuranas say about the temples and cities supposedly built around Arunachela bythe gods; nevertheless the central motif of the story is the eternal enduranceof the Red Hill through the cataclysms that accompany the end of world ages, andit is specifically stated: ‘Oceans will not submerge it, even at the time of thegreat deluge.’49 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn49] So it was herethat I wondered if there might be some crossover with the Kumari Kandam myth.‘This memory of gods building the first temple and cities at Arunachela,’ I nowasked, ‘what period do you think it originates in? If those cities are supposedto have been built at the same time as the formation of the mountain and theself-generated lingam, then that’s surely an awfully long time ago.‘Geology says it must have been 3.5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn5] billion or 2.5 billion years agothat Arunachela first took its form as a mountain. But such a time-span seemsoutside any reasonable scale for the construction of cities and temples, sincewe know that the human race only came into being, what is it, 100,000 or 200,000years ago? No “memory” of ours can be older than that.‘But if they’re to be placed in the human scale, if they’re not just somethingthat’s been made up by stortytellers, then shouldn’t archaeologists be able tofind at least some traces of these former cities of the gods?’The Captain shrugged. ‘Probably during the previous destructions of the worldtheir remains have been hidden from us and if we could search sufficientlywidely probably we could find many cities below the surface of the earth.’He seemed to reflect for a moment. ‘You see,’ he said at last, ‘Arunachela is inthe land of the Dravidians, where our language goes back more than 10,000years.’He then told me that the Red Hill was referred to in the most ancient survivingwork of Tamil literature, the Tolkappiyam,50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn50] which itself makes reference toan even earlier work now lost to history which in turn had supposedly been partof a library of archaic texts, all now also vanished, the compilation of whichwas said to have begun more than 10,000 years previously. This had been thelibrary of the legendary First Sangam – or ‘Academy’ – of the lost Tamilcivilization of Kumari Kandam, swallowed up, as Captain Narayan put it, ‘by amajor eruption of the sea’.And one of the members of the First Sangam, he added, finally making the directconnection that I suspected to the Arunachela story, had been Siva himself,51[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn51] the god in the mountain, the godof yoga performing tapas beneath a tree at the top of the mountain, the god ofcosmic knowledge compressed into the lingam at the foot of the mountain.ACADEMIES OF THE GODSAs Captain Naryan walked us to the gate of the Sri Ramana Ashram later thatafternoon, he gave me the name and telephone number of a friend who he hopedmight be useful to me in the city of Madurai, the next great centre of the cultof Siva that we intended to visit in south India. There, he told me, there wereknowledgeable professors at many colleges and universities – for Madurai hasbeen always been a place of scholarship and learning – who would certainly beable to tell me much more about Kumari Kandam and the Sangam tradition. Norcould there be any more appropriate place to mount such an inquiry, sinceMadurai itself was an important part of the Sangam tradition – having served asthe headquarters of the Third Sangam …‘So let me see if I’ve got this right,’ I asked in parting. ‘We have a FirstSangam thousands of years ago and it gets flooded – the city which it’s in getsflooded?’‘You are right. Permanently flooded. It was overwhelmed by the sea.’‘And that city was?’‘It was called Tenmadurai – which means “Southern Madurai”. It was in thesouthern part of Kumari Kandam. After it was gone, a city called Kapatapuramthat lay further to the north was chosen as the headquarters of the SecondSangam. It endured for some thousands of years but ultimately it too wasflooded. Our oldest surviving text, the Tolkappiyam, is a work of the SecondSangam.’‘And then?’‘Finally, when Kumari Kandam had entirely gone beneath the sea, the Third Sangamwas established in the city of Madurai. Then it was called Uttara Madurai,“Northern Madurai”.’LINGAM OR OMPHALOS?Before we left Tiruvannamalai we visited the Arunachelswar temple in order tosee Lord Siva in his lingam form.Walking barefoot through the ambulatories and open stone-paved plazas, we passedrows of poor, homeless and hungry people, for the most part dressed in rags –here a mother with sunken breasts trying to suckle her child, there an old blindman, here a cripple, there a leper – waiting patiently for the charity soupkitchen to feed them.If we looked up we could see the rugged red peak of Arunachela looming above us,framed by the tall towers of the gopurams that marked the main entrances of eachof the temple’s internested rectangular zones. Their steep pyramidal form, andtheir general arrangement in opposing pairs around a geometrical central plaza,as well as the scale of the whole enterprise, reminded me forcefully of theMayan city of Tikal in Guatemala, and of Angkor Thorn and Angkor Wat inCambodia. Indeed, in general, it has for a long while struck me as worthy ofnote that so many of the world’s ancient places of worship – in Europe, Egypt,Israel, Mesopotamia, India, south-east Asia, China, Japan, Central America andthe Andes, for example – have assertively geometrical designs and architecture.What is this recurrent association of geometry with the religious quest?Certainly, it seems that there were many great thinkers in antiquity who, ifasked ‘What is God?’, might well have replied, as St Bernard of Clairvaux did tothe same question, ‘He is length, width, height and depth.’52[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn52]Because all Hindu temples are part circus, we encountered a painted elephantsurveying the world through a jaundiced eye, chained up in a stone pillaredpavilion, and when we descended the steps to the sacred pool, known asSiva-ganga Teertham we were followed by a persistent fortune-teller who couldonly with great difficulty be persuaded to relinquish what he clearly felt was afair claim on us.Soon after we had shaken him off (not until Santha had relented and agreed tohave her fortune told for 100 rupees) we were appropriated by a beautifuldoe-eyed young man in flowing white robes who floated up to us declaring himselfto be a Brahmin and the son of a senior priest of the temple. As though readingour thoughts he then led us towards the sanctuary where the ‘self-generated’lingam of Siva resides, explaining as he did so that it was normally out ofbounds to non-Hindus, but that we had happily chanced, in his person, upon justthe man to get us inside. The only thing we would not be allowed to do, he said,was touch the lingam – a privilege that was reserved for initiated Sivachariars.I have been offered illegal access to inaccessible areas in many temples aroundthe world, and the young Brahmin’s patter was so familiar that I could alreadyalmost count the 100 rupee notes changing hands. Still, we followed him througha maze of crowded rooms and hallways, visited various subsidiary shrines wherewe were fed puffed rice and sugar, had our foreheads liberally smeared with ash,and jumped a queue of worshippers at the entrance to the principal sanctuary.Then suddenly, for just a few moments, we were in the presence of the naturalpillar or cylinder of stone that is venerated by the faithful as the eternalmanifestation of Siva himself. The pillar, however, was so decked out withfinery, robes, jewellery and an elaborate head-dress in the form of a rearinggolden cobra hood that it was impossible to get a clear glimpse of any part ofit. All that I can say is that it seemed to be less than half a metre thick andapproximately 1.5 metres high and was rounded like a cigar-tube at the tip –very much, in other words, like ‘unclothed’ Sivalinga that can be seen intemples and shrines all around India.So what was special about this one?As he took my money, the Brahmin could only repeat the old mantras – that it isa wonder of nature wrought by the power of Siva, that it is ancient and nobodyknows how old it is, and that the first temple to be built around it was thework of the gods.THE NUMBERS OF TIME AND THE WORLD GRIDIn previous books I have grappled several times with the hypothesis that theearth and all its oceans may have been explored, mapped and accurately measuredwith lines of latitude and longitude – a pre-eminently ‘civilized’ andsophisticated activity – thousands of years before what we now think of ashistory began.53 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn53] I want to avoidthe tedious repetition of evidence and arguments that I have already presentedin Fingerprints of the Gods and Heaven’s Mirror, but, in summary, the problem isthis: certain medieval and Renaissance maps seem to express sophisticatedgeographical and cartographic knowledge far ahead of the science of their age. Anumber of researchers attribute this knowledge to older source documents thathave not come down to us. In his Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, for example,Charles Hapgood draws attention to the accurate longitudes on the so-called‘portolano’ charts of the fourteenth century (400 years before the invention ofHarrison’s Chronometer supposedly made the accurate measurement of longitude atsea feasible for the first time). Hapgood believes that the anachronism may beexplained by the survival of ancient cartographical knowledge (either in theform of maps copied and recopied again and again down the generations, or in theform of oral traditions retained and passed on amongst mariners) that originatedwith a highly advanced, sophisticated and as yet unidentified seafaringcivilization of prehistory. He makes the same argument for the appearance ofAntarctica on the Oronteus Finnaeus map of 1539 (some 300 years beforeAntarctica is believed to have been ‘discovered’).54[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn54]Evidence that provides some tangential support for the general thrust ofHapgood’s theory comes from a large sequence of numbers – including 18, 36, 72,144, 2160, 4320, 25,920, etc. – that appears repeatedly and prominently inancient myths, scriptures and traditions from all around the world.55[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn55] According to the late ProfessorGiorgio de Santillana of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and ProfessorHertha von Dechend of Frankfurt University, these ubiquitous numbers derive froman archaic astronomical tradition which used shared, globally diffusedconventions to record its observations of the stars. The central symbol of thesystem depicts a great wheel that rotates in heaven, ‘churning’ or ‘milling’ forthousands of years. The entire axis, spokes and bands that bind this wheel aresaid to be periodically broken by recurrent cataclysms – often flood and fire –at which point a new wheel is forged and the cycle begins again.Santillana and von Dechend’s explanation for this symbolism and for the numbersassociated with it is that it is a metaphor for the celestial phenomenon thatastronomers today call ‘precession’. This is a slow, cyclical wobble of theearth’s axis in space so that, if the tip of the north (or south) pole wereimaginarily extended it would be seen to transcribe a great circle amongst thepolar stars over a period of 25,920 years. Though it was not thought to havebeen detected until the time of the Greeks, it is Santillana and von Dechend’sradical contention that precession was observed, and measured, thousands ofyears earlier than that by what they describe as ‘some almost unbelievableancestor civilization’.56 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn56] Theyfurther claim that it is these same ancient measurements (all time measurements)that generate the mysterious numbers in the myths.The most notable effect of precession is that it causes a slow, relentless driftof the background of stars against which the sun is seen to rise on the springequinox (21 March, when night and day are of equal length). This is called ‘theprecession of the equinoxes’. Although it can be detected by relatively simpleobservations, these must be sustained over several generations before thesequence begins to emerge.The ruling number in the sequence, Santillana and von Dechend suggest, is 72 –the round number of years required to observe one degree of the precession ofthe equinoxes.57 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn57] This, they say,is why the tally of significant numbers in the myths includes 72 and multiplesof 72 (e.g. 144, 720, 2160, 4320, etc.); 36 (half of 72) and multiples of 36; 24(one-third of 72) and multiples of 24, etc. The system also uses other ways ofcombining these numbers – e.g., 72 + 36 = 108, a sacred number in many cultures,while half of 108 is 54, also a sacred number, as is 540 or 540,000, or5,400,000, etc. and as are 108,000, 1,800,000, and so on.58[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn58]It may be that this powerful number system is not based on the observation ofthe precession of the equinoxes at all and that some explanation other than alost civilization will ultimately be found for it. But what cannot be denied isthe simple, well-evidenced fact that the system exists – whatever its source –and that it occurs in known texts of all the great archaic mythological andreligious systems, amongst them ancient Sumer and Babylon, Vedic India, ancientEgypt, ancient Greece, ancient China, the Maya of Central America, the OldTestament Hebrews and many other cultures.59[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn59]It was only while I was writing Heaven’s Mirror that I began to look intoanother and much more controversial possibility – that a network of sacred sitesmight have been established all around the globe according to a longitude gridbased on precessional numbers. Thus, the massive sacred complexes on which standthe Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt and the fabulous temples of Angkor inCambodia are on meridians 72 degrees of longitude apart; Pohnpei is 54 degreesof longitude east of Angkor; Easter Island is today the closest dry land to 144degrees of longitude east of Angkor; the Bay of Paracas in Peru, dominated bythe massive cliff drawing of unknown origin known as the ‘Candelabra of theAndes’, lies 180 degrees east of Angkor. Frequently these sites are linked toflood myths, spoken of in ancient traditions as ‘Navels of the Earth’ (omphalosin Greek), and are rich in symbolism of obelisks, stone pillars, pyramids andother stone monuments.60 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn60]All this I was already well aware of during my travels in India in February andMarch 2000. Yet I honestly did not expect when I came to Arunachela, despite itsobvious and prevalent omphalos/lingam symbolism, that it too would prove to belocated at a meaningful point on the same hypothetical ‘precessional grid’. Ionly looked it up in the longitude tables as a matter of routine. As soon as Idid so, however, it was immediately obvious that a relationship based onsignificant precessional numbers does in fact exist between Arunachela and othergrid sites – for it lies 24 degrees west of Angkor and 48 degrees east of Giza(respectively one-third and two-thirds of the 72 degrees of longitude separatingthe former from the latter).61 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn61]Apparent longitudinal ‘correlations’ linking sacred sites according to asequence of numbers thought to have been derived from astronomical observationsthat occur in ancient myths and scriptures could, of course, arise by chance. Idon’t deny that possibility. But I wish to pursue what I believe to be the moreinteresting explanation – namely that such sites may originally have beenestablished on specific longitudes to act as permanent markers and referencepoints for an archaic worldwide grid of earth measurements and to safeguardprecious geodetic and navigational knowledge for the long-term benefit ofmankind.This, indeed, is little more than is already claimed in the ancient Indianaccounts of the deluge, and the survival of it by a remnant of wise men, andtheir preservation and repromulgation of antediluvian knowledge in the new ageof the earth. Moreover, it can hardly be an accident that the yuga system thatlies at the heart of the Dwarka story, of the story of the flood of Manu, and ofthe Hindu concept of recurrent cycles of cataclysm and rebirth, is alsodenominated in terms of precessional numbers. According to the Puranas, forexample, the duration of the Kali Yuga is set at 1200 ‘divine years’, equivalentto 432,000 mortal years. The durations for the preceding Krita, Treta andDavapara Yugas are set respectively at 4800 divine years, 3600 divine years and2400 divine years, such that one mahayuga – made up of the total of 12,000divine years contained in the four lesser yugas – is equivalent to 4,320,000years of mortals.62 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn62]Whatever the explanation ultimately turns out to be, and whether Santillana andvon Dechend are basically right or basically wrong, the worldwide distributionof such an intricate sequence of numbers, not only in myths but also inarchitecture (e.g., the 72 pillars of the Dwarkadish temple), represents aserious problem that orthodox historians have so far failed to address.If it is not ‘coincidence’, then what is it?THE RIDDLE OF VISHNU’S THREE STEPSSantha and I treated ourselves to a luxury in south India in February 2000,which we would never have dreamed of affording back in 1992. This was acomfortable, crème-white, air-conditioned Ambassador limousine (for what wasgoing to turn out to be a journey of almost 3000 kilometres) with Palani, asmall, wiry ex-army driver from Chennai, at the wheel. With his steady nervesand encyclopedic knowledge of the highways and byways of Tamil Nadu, he was thebest possible guide and friend we could have had on such a journey. When Ineeded a beer in a ‘dry’ town he always knew (although never imbibing himself)where to obtain bottles of cold, illicit Kingfisher wrapped up in brown papersacks. And more to the point he put us through no collisions, no nerve-janglingskids, no horrific misjudgements of the proximity of a pedestrian, nodeath-defying overtaking manoeuvres, and no falling asleep at the wheel.From Tiruvannamalai we drove south all day towards Madurai through a rich,green, predominantly flat dreamscape of paddy fields and palm trees dotted hereand there with the weird outcroppings of ancient red granite that are thecharacteristic feature of this region. There were people everywhere, Tamilpeasant farmers at work in the fields in brightly coloured clothes, or strollingalong the road, sometimes drying cattle fodder on the road itself, doing hardlabour on building sites and eighteen-hour days in wayside shops and stalls – atremendous mass of individual human lives surviving in many cases on the veryedge of absolute penury yet somehow making do and getting by. It was fascinatingto realize, and impossible to ignore, that the religion of all these industriouspeople was a peculiarly Saivite brand of Hinduism: * Siva ‘the embodiment of knowledge’.63 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn63] * Siva, the god of wisdom, who rules in ‘the city of knowledge’ (jnana-puri, literally ‘gnosis city’).64 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn64] * Siva who takes the form of Arunachela, ‘the mountain of knowledge’.65 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn65] * Siva who, through initiation into gnosis, has the power to inflict or to withhold death and to grant immortality.66 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn66]In some texts, I had been interested to learn, Siva is identified with Vishnu.In the Mahabaratha, for example, there is an episode in which the warrior Arjunaexperiences a revelation after being wrestled to the ground by a huge stalwartbeing:Arjuna’s limbs were bruised and he was deprived of his senses. When he recoveredhe hailed the god, saying: ‘Thou art Siva in the form of Vishnu and Vishnu inthe form of Siva … O Hari, O Rudra, I bow to thee.’67[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn67]In the Rig Veda, Vishnu’s principal exploit, recounted and celebrated again andagain, is the taking of ‘three steps’.68[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn68] Although it is agreed that thesesteps must symbolize something of profound importance, scholars have as yetreached no consensus as to their underlying meaning.69[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn69]I pulled the Griffith translation of the Rig Veda from the half-open satchelthat lay perched between Santha and myself on the middle of the back seat andopened it at Book I, Hymn 104:I will declare the mighty deeds of Vishnu, of him who measured out the earthlyregions … thrice setting down his footstep, widely striding. For this mightydeed is Vishnu lauded … He within whose three wide-extended paces all livingcreatures have their habitation … Him who alone with triple step hath measuredthis common dwelling place, long, far extended …70[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn70]All kinds of symbolism might indeed be intended in such a passage, but if wetake the hymn at face value, then isn’t it rather clearly saying that Vishnumeasured out the earth by taking three footsteps? We might speculate on whatprecisely the footsteps represent, but the involvement of the whole enterprisein earth-measuring – i.e., geography – cannot reasonably be denied.Other passages reinforce the same conclusion, describing Vishnu, for example, as‘He who strode, widely pacing, with three steppings forth over the realms ofearth for freedom and for life …’71[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn71] Two verses later we read that‘He, like a rounded wheel, hath set in swift motion his 90 racing steedstogether with the four …’72 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn72] Whatcould the function of this latter verse possibly be if it is not to invite us tomultiply 90 by 4, giving us the 360 degrees of the circle (or ‘rounded wheel’)?Remember, we have been told just beforehand that such an approach to measuringout ‘the realms of earth’ is a contribution to the cause of freedom and life – aclear incentive to its preservation!In Book 6, Hymn 49 of the Rig we find Vishnu described as ‘He who for man’sbehoof in his affliction thrice measured out the earthly regions.’73[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn73] Again, the idea seems to be thatVishnu’s earth-measuring endeavours were of great value and benefit to mankindand were, moreover, delivered in a time of ‘affliction’.Last but not least, in Book I, Hymn 164, we encounter the following riddle:Formed with 12 spokes, by length of time, unweakened, rolls round the heaventhis wheel of during Order. Herein established, joined in pairs together, 720sons stand …74 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn74]So here, represented by a multiple of its ‘ruling’ number 72, pops up Santillanaand von Dechend’s ancient precessional code combined in the same passage withthe familiar ‘wheel of heaven’ metaphor of the precession of the equinoxes. Thepassage also provides further evidence that the convention still in use bymodern geographers of dividing the circle into 360 degrees (or 720 half-degrees)was already in existence in Vedic times and is directly alluded to in this hymn.Likewise, the 12 spokes of the wheel are anachronistically suggestive of the 12‘houses’ of the (supposedly Graeco-BabyIonian) zodiac in which the sun rests for30 ‘days’ of each precessional month – each such month being equivalent to 2160human years with the entire precessional cycle thus amounting to 12 × 2160 =25,920 human years.75 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn75]SURVIVING THE NULL HYPOTHESISCould there really be ‘science’, in the hard, empirical, modern sense, in theancient Indian scriptures?According to Dr Richard L. Thompson, who received his Ph.D. in mathematics fromCornell University, where he specialized in probability theory and statisticalmechanics, the answer to this question is ‘yes … probably’! In his impressivelyresearched and thoroughly documented study Mysteries of the Sacred UniverseThompson takes a particularly close look at the Bhagvata Purana (a latercompilation of oral traditions than the Rig Veda but one that neverthelessbelongs, as we have seen, to the same body of knowledge).76[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn76] In it he draws attention to acurious word picture called Bhu Mandala that the Purana conjures up and thatconsists of circles and internested spheres of precise, very large, dimensions.He argues that Bhu Mandala is a complex and cleverly designed cosmological modelserving at one and the same time as an accurate map of the solar system and as aplanar projection map of the earth.77[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn77]Thompson’s arguments must be considered on their own merits backed up by thedetailed evidence that he sets out in his book. But the centrepiece of his caseis the electrifying correlation, to which he is the first to draw seriousattention, between the dimensions given for the various circles of Bhu Mandalain the Bhagvata Purana and the actual dimensions of the planetary orbits withinthe solar system as determined by modern science.78[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn78] Since the correlations turn outto be extremely close, Thompson concludes:[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_046_r1.jpg]The Bhu Mandala shown as a tilted ring in relation to a local horizon on Earth.Based on Thompson (2000).[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_047_r1.jpg]Orbits of Saturn and Uranus around Earth.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_048_r1.jpg]It is clear that Bhu Mandala, as described in the Bhagvatam, can be interpretedas a geocentric map of the solar system out to Saturn. But an obvious andimportant question is: Did some real knowledge of planetary distances enter intothe construction of the Bhu Mandala system, or are the correlations between BhuMandala features and planetary orbits simply coincidental?79[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn79]Being a mathematician interested in probability theory, Thompson is betterequipped than most to answer this question and does so through computermodelling of a proposed ‘null hypothesis’ – i.e.,that the author of the Bhagvatam had no access to correct planetary distancesand therefore all apparent correlations between Bhu Mandala features andplanetary distances are simply coincidental.80[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn80]However, the Bhu Mandala/solar system correlations proved resilient enough tosurvive the null hypothesis. ‘Analysis shows that the observed correlations arein fact highly improbable.’81 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn81]Thompson concludes:If the dimensions given in the Bhagvatam do, in fact, represent realisticplanetary distances based on human observation, then we must postulate thatBhagvata astronomy preserves material from an earlier and presently unknownperiod of scientific development … [and that] some people in the past must havehad accurate values for the dimensions of the planetary orbits. In modernhistory, this information has only become available since the development ofhigh-quality telescopes in the last 200 years. Accurate values of planetarydistances were not known by Hellenistic astronomers such as Claudius Ptolemy,nor are they found in the medieval Jyotisa Sutras of India. If this informationwas known it must have been acquired by some unknown civilization thatflourished in the distant past.82 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn82]Needless to say, a civilization that could make accurate maps of planetarydistances, a hypothetical civilization of the distant past that had approachedto within 200 years of our own level of development in astronomy, would have hadno great difficulty in observing and measuring the precession of the equinoxes,or in dividing up the earthly and celestial spheres into degrees of longitudeand latitude, or in consecrating a series of sacred sites at specificlongitudes, and, in the process, exploring and mapping the globe.Neither do I find it at all difficult to imagine how the geodetic andcartographic works of such an elder culture might have been remembered in muchlater and more superstitious times as gifts that had been handed down by thegods.Had some stone pillar, now venerated as the self-generated lingam of Siva, beenset up by prehistoric geodecists at Arunachela, for example, to mark theauspicious longitude of the Red Hill? The same symbolism of the lingam is, ofcourse, found all over the temples of Angkor in Cambodia. And in ancient Egyptthe conical Ben Ben stone, perched atop a stone pillar, was the symbol of theHeliopolitan priesthood that built the Pyramids of Giza.Same symbolism in all three places.Same gnostic quest for immortality.Same use of precessional numbers in their architecture and their myths.And there are 48 degrees of longitude between Giza and Arunachela, 24 degreesbetween Arunachela and Angkor, and 72 degrees between Giza and Angkor.Coincidence?Design?Take your pick.MADURAIA few hours later, well after dark, the Ambassador rolled smoothly across thethin membrane that separates rural from urban life in India, and we foundourselves in Madurai. As the reader will recall, Captain Naryan had told me thatthis city, with the great Meenakshi temple residing at its heart, was the siteof the third and last Sangam, or Academy, of Tamil poets and philosophers – aninstitution that traced its origins back to the antediluvian civilization ofKumari Kandam.While we drove through the crowded streets blaring with sound and lights Iremembered that the First Sangam was said to have been established manythousands of years ago in an earlier ‘Madurai’ – Tenmadurai – that lay far tothe south on lands subsequently swallowed up by the sea.It is astonishing how little attention has been paid to these Tamil myths, andhow little has been written about them outside the subcontinent. Even DavidSchulman, who has done more than most to fill this gap in knowledge, isdismissive of the significance of the traditions:The story of the three Cankam [Sangams] as it appears in our sources is suspecton many counts, and there is no geological evidence of any deluge affecting thearea in historical times.83 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-ftn83]Though I respect Dr Schulman’s work, which offers a lucid exposition in Englishof the Tamil flood myths, he is dead wrong to consider only whether deluges haveaffected the area in historical times when massive geological corroborationexists for multiple deluges at the end of the last Ice Age – well within thetime-frame of more than 10,000 years that is set out in the Sangam traditionitself.Could it be the ruins of Kumari Kandam that are lying in 23 metres of water 5kilometres off-shore of Poompuhur? And could those mythical antediluviansremembered by the ancient Tamils have been the source of the fragments of highcartographical and astronomical knowledge that seem to have been fossilized inthe ancient Indian texts?"},{"pageContent":"11 / THE QUEST FOR KUMARI RANDAMThe river Prahuli, and the mountain Kumari, surrounded by many hills, weresubmerged by the raging sea.Silipathikaram xx: 17–20With reference to the first two Sangams I may say that the account is toomythical and fabulous to be entitled to any credit and I do not think that anyscholar who has studied the histories of the world will be bold enough to admitsuch tales within the pale of real history.Professor Sesagiri Sastri, Essay on Tamil Literature, Madras 1897FEBRUARY 2000-JANUARY 2001, SOUTH INDIAMadurai is an ancient city but it has little to show, other than a few texts ofdisputed antiquity,1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn1] to back upits claim to have been the headquarters of the third and last of the great TamilSangams (‘Academies’). It can produce no evidence in support of its furtherclaim that the Third Sangam was the direct-line descendant of two earlierSangams, dating back thousands of years into prehistory, located in antediluvianTamil cities that had once existed far to the south of Madurai but that had beenswallowed up by the sea. The very word ‘Sangam’ turns out not even to be derivedfrom the Tamil language (it is Sanskrit) and does not appear in any of the textsthat tradition attributes to the Third Sangam period.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn2] Last but not least, the earliestsurviving written account of the so-called ‘Sangam Age’ is not thought byscholars to be older than the sixth century AD.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn3]By his use of such arguments the late K. N. Shivaraja Pillai – whose highlyregarded but rare Chronology of the Early Tamils I was able to consult at aresearch library in Madurai – stands out as the most persuasive opponent of thealluring notion of lost Tamil lands and a lost Tamil civilization in the IndianOcean. He wags an admonishing finger at those tempted to wonder if there mightbe even a drop of the truth anywhere in the story of Kumari Kandam and the firsttwo Sangams, and proclaims the whole thing to beone of the most daring literary forgeries ever perpetrated. The incredibly highantiquity with which Tamil literature comes to be invested by this legend, andthe high connection with divinity it brings about, were more than enough tosecure for it a ready acceptance by a credulous public.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn4]The historical annals of most cultures contain examples of this kind ofmanipulation of the past in order to annex some dignity or aura of the divine toa fledgling royal dynasty, or to dress up a new cult in a cloak of antiquevenerability – or, for that matter, to render arriviste philosophies or literaryworks more acceptable to traditionalists by attaching them to existing orimagined traditions.5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn5] It istherefore easy to see the force of Pillai’s arguments, and, since he publishedhis Chronology in 1932, his view that Kumari Kandam is nothing more than a‘preposterous story’6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn6] has been thedominant one amongst serious scholars of Tamil history.This, of course, by no means guarantees that his view is correct. On thecontrary, as I continued my research in Madurai, the potential significance andimplications of what the NIO had found in 1993 off the south-east coast of TamilNadu at Poompuhur began to weigh more and more heavily on my mind.LOST LANDS AND FLOODED CITIESFrom the photographs and descriptions that I had by this time seen and read,everything about the U-shaped structure appeared to be strikingly anomalous. Yetequally striking was the way in which it had thus far attracted zero attentionor interest outside the rather closed world of the NIO (which had been unable todo anything further about it because of insufficient funding). I found this lackof interest and knowledge to be almost unbelievable.After all, the fully qualified Indian marine archaeologists who had dived on thestructure in 1993 had not hesitated in their official report to pronounce it tobe man-made with ‘courses of masonry’ plainly visible – surely a momentousfinding 5 kilometres from the shore at a depth of 23 metres? But far fromexciting attention, or ruffling any academic feathers, or attracting funds foran extension of the diving survey to the other apparently man-made mounds thathad been spotted near by on the sea-bed – and very far indeed from inspiring anyTamil expert to re-evaluate the derided possibility of a factual basis to theKumari Kandam myth – the NIO’s discovery at Poompuhur had simply been ignored byscholarship, not even reacted to or dismissed, but just widely and generallyignored.All the more I felt it was my role to be proactive and to stir things up aroundthis matter. Because if the U-shaped structure was indeed man-made and more than10,000 years old (remember at this stage I still did not have Glenn Milne’sinundation maps that would later push the age of the ruins back to 11,000 yearsold or older) then things were going to have to change in south Indian history.Despite all the question marks that had been raised over it on literary andphilological grounds, the myth of Kumari Kandam and of the two antediluvianSangams would suddenly clamour to be taken seriously.After all, it is one thing for scholars like Shivaraja Pillai, David Schulmanand others, to belittle the historical significance of a myth for which thereseems to be no substantiating evidence, but it is quite another to try tosustain such a posture among a growing community of scholars and interestedmembers of the public with access to inundation data like Milne’s.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_049_r1.jpg]14.

Incorporating SriLanka in the south-east, extending southward, below Cape Comorin, and enhancedoff-shore by the enlarged Lacadives/Maldives archipelago running all the way tothe equator and into the southern hemisphere, the maps portray the region as noculture of the historical period is supposed to have known it: yet when I lookat them through half-closed eyes I can almost imagine that someone has tried todraw, at various stages of its supposedly mythical inundation, the much biggerDravidian homeland of thousands of years ago that is described in the KumariKandam tradition.Coincidence? Or mystery? * With its dominant motif of a once much larger Dravidian homeland, the opening of the Kumari Kandam flood myth is set in remote prehistory between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. * The work of Glenn Milne and other inundation specialists confirms that between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago India’s Dravidian peninsula and its outlying islands would indeed have been far larger than they are today – but were in the process of being swallowed up by the rising seas at the end of the Ice Age. * With its descriptions of flooded cities and lost lands, the Kumari Kandam myth ‘predicts’ that prehistoric ruins more than 10,000 years old should lie underwater at various depths and locations off the Tamil Nadu coast. * The NIO’s discovery of a large and apparently man-made structure at a depth of 23 metres off Poompuhur seems to confirm the accuracy of this prediction.If the myth is right about the flooded cities, then what else might it be rightabout?If there is anything at all to the story of the First and Second Sangamsorchestrating a golden age of literary, artistic and musical creativity amongstthe Tamils of 10,000 years ago and maintaining an archive of written records,then it means not only that an as yet unidentified culture of the last Ice Agemay have flourished in the lost lands of the Indian Ocean, but also that we seemto be dealing with a civilization here that had reached a high level ofdevelopment, organization and self-awareness.THE TEACHINGS OF ILLUSTRIOUS MENThe sources for all that is known today about Kumari Kandam are limited and itis true, as the detractors of the myth point out, that the oldest writtenversion dates from no earlier than the sixth century AD – some would even makeit as young a document as the tenth century AD. Supposedly the work of therenowned medieval commentator Nakirar, this version appears in a learned glossto the Iriyanar Agapporul, a grammar of classic Tamil love poetry in sixtysutras.7 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn7] Our concern here is notwith the Agapporul, but strictly and exclusively with Nakirar’s gloss, which isitself said to have been ‘handed down orally for ten generations before it wasput into writing’.8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn8]Other medieval commentators who support Nakirar by speaking of Kumari Kandam andof the first two Sangams not as myths but as historical entities areNachinarkkiniyar, in his gloss to the Tolkappiyam Poruladikaram, thedistinguished Per-Asiriyar in his commentary upon the Tolkappiyam, andAdiyarkkunelar, in his commentary on the Silipathikaram.9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn9]As my research continued in Madurai, therefore, I was not surprised to learnthat long before something looking very much like underwater ruins had beenfound off the south-east coast of India in exactly the depth/age-range that ispredicted by the Kumari Kandam myth, the credibility lent to the flood andSangam tradition by the illustrious men who passed it down to us had clearlybegun to worry some otherwise sceptical modern historians:Three commentators of no mean scholarship and repute have unreservedly acceptedthe version of the commentator of the Iriyanar Agapporul. Though it is easy todismiss these valuable works as unhistorical and uncritical and hence worthlessto students of history, still we cannot afford to credit commentators with suchignorance of the subject which they were handling. When they quote with approvalit means they were satisfied of the veracity of the tradition behind theaccount.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn10]THE KUMARI KANDAM TRADITION (1)Although I am (of course!) writing Underworld with the benefit of hindsight, Ihave sought to unfold the key information that it contains in something of thegradual and fragmentary manner in which it reached me. Thus I didn’t learn aboutKumari Kandam and the Sangam tradition all at once – but rather in dribs anddrabs over a period of many months – and this is reflected in the details that Ihave already given about Kumari Kandam in earlier chapters.Now, with all the resources of Madurai at my disposal, I was able to compile amore extensive and accurate summary of what the tradition actually says (asopposed to what others say about it): * Over a period of just under 10,000 years, the Pandyans (a part-historical, part-legendary dynasty of Tamil kings) formed three Sangams or Academies in order to foster among their subjects the love of knowledge, literature and poetry: ‘These Assemblies were the fountainhead of Tamil culture, and their principal concern was the perfection of Tamil language and literature.’11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn11] * The first two Sangams were not located in what is now peninsular India but in the antediluvian Dravidian land to the south ‘which in ancient times bore the name Kumari Kandam’12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn12] (literally ‘the Land of the Virgin’ – or perhaps ‘the Virgin Continent’).13 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn13] * The First Sangam was headquartered in a city named Tenmadurai (‘Southern Madurai’). It had 549 members ‘beginning, with Agattiyanar (the sage Agastaya) … Among others were God Siva of braided hair … Murugan the hill god, and Kubera the Lord of Treasure.’14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn14] * Patronized by a succession of eighty-nine kings, the First Sangam survived as an institution over an unbroken period of 4440 years, during which time it approved and codified an immense library of poems and literature. These classic texts, all now lost and known only by their titles, are said to have included works such as the Agattiyam, Paripadal, Mudunarai, Mudukurgu and Kalariyavirai – still well known and revered among Tamils today.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn15] * At the end of this golden age the First Sangam was destroyed when the deluge arose and Tenmadurai was ‘swallowed by the sea’ along with large parts of the land area of Kumari Kandam.16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn16] * However, survivors of the antediluvian civilization were able to relocate further north, saving some of the First Sangam books, and the Second Sangam, said to have been patronized by fifty-nine kings, was established in another city – Kavatapuram. ‘The Agattiyam and Tolkappiyam, the Mapuranam, Isainunukkam, and Budapuranam were their grammars. The duration of the period of this Sangam was 3700 years.’17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn17] Then, like its predecessor, the Second Sangam was ‘swallowed by the sea’ and lost for ever with all its works (with the possible exception, some claim, of the Tolkappiyam, which has survived to this day).18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn18] * Following the inundation of Kavatapuram the survivors of the Kumari Kandam civilization again relocated northward, this time into peninsular India, where the headquarters of the Third Sangam was established in a city identified with modern Madurai – then known as Uttara Madurai or Vadamadurai (‘Northern Madurai’, presumably to distinguish it from its antediluvian predecessor ‘Southern Madurai’).19 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn19] * The Third Sangam survived for a further 1850 years: ‘Forty-nine were the kings who patronized this Academy.’20 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn20]CHOOSING THE RIGHT SLOTA matter that I found hard to reconcile while I talked to the experts and readup the literature in Madurai was the way in which the very same Tamilauthorities who brush off the First and Second Sangams as ‘preposterousstories’,21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn21] accept without demurthe existence of the Third Sangam – or anyway some sort of genuinely Tamilinstitution of letters that might retrospectively have been referred to by theSanskrit term Sangam. Most, moreover, agree upon dates of between AD 350 and 550for the termination of this Third Sangam’s activities.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn22]For example, Ramachandra Dikshitar proposes that ‘the end of the fifth centuryAD marked the extinction of the Academy’.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn23] He adds:Though the origin of the Sangam as an institution is shrouded in deep mystery,still the fact remains that there was something like an organized Academy … andit continued to exist for several centuries. A definite stage was reached by thebeginning of the sixth century AD [after the extinction of the Academy] when theTamil language underwent some transformation in regard to style, metre, etc.24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn24]According to Shivaraja Pillai – as ever pursuing his ‘forgery’ case against thescheme of things set out in the commentary on the Agapporul.The fabricator appears to have started from some authentic data before him. Theywere the so-called ‘Third Sangam’ works, which in all probability must have bythat time assumed a collected form. These collections furnished the basis onwhich he proceeded to raise his imaginary structure of the Three Sangams.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn25]If we accept the generally agreed date of between AD 350 and 550 for the end ofthe – at least semi-historical – ‘Third Sangam’, then this gives us a fixedreference point on which to anchor the chronology of the myth: * AD 350 minus the 1850 years given as the duration of the Third Sangam takes us back to 1500 BC (i.e., about 3500 years ago); * 1500 BC minus the 3700 years given as the duration of the Second Sangam takes us back to 5200 BC (7200 years ago); * 5200 BC minus the 4440 years given as the duration of the First Sangam takes us back to 9600 BC (11,600 years ago).The date of 9600 BC for the formation of the First Sangam (or 9800 BC or 9400 BCfor that matter) coincides closely enough with Plato’s date for the inundationof Atlantis – also 9600 BC – to raise the hairs on the back of my neck.And the question continues to be this: how could Plato less than 2500 years ago,or Nakirar less than 1500 years ago, have managed by chance to select the epochof 9600 BC in which to set, on the one hand, the sinking under the waves of theAtlantic Ocean of the great antediluvian civilization of Atlantis and, on theother, the foundation of the First Sangam in Kumari Kandam – a doomed IndianOcean landmass that was itself destined to be swallowed up by the sea?If Plato and Nakirar were pure ‘fabulists’ working independently of any realtradition or real events, then isn’t it much more likely that they would havechosen different imaginary epochs in which to set their flood stories?Why didn’t they chose 20,000 or 30,000 years ago – or even 300,000 years ago, orthree million years ago – instead of the tenth millennium BC?And was it just luck that this slot turns out to have been in the midst of themeltdown of the last Ice Age – the only episode of truly global flooding to havehit the earth in the last 125,000 years?THE KUMARI KANDAM TRADITION (2)More information than I have already reported remains to be gleaned within themedieval commentaries. And outside the commentaries there are several allusionsin Tamil literature that can also fairly safely be said to be part of ‘thetradition behind the account’ – even if they do not always refer to KumariKandam or to the first two Sangams by name. Some are in works of considerableantiquity and high renown, others are in less well-known sources, but all in oneway or another add to our picture of the lost Tamil lands and of the floods thatancient peoples believed had swallowed them up.According to V. Kanakasabhai, a specialist in south Indian history, the Tamilsof the early first millennium AD preserved a tradition, already ancient in theirtime,that in former days the land had extended further south and that a mountaincalled Kumarikoddu, and a large tract of country watered by the river Prahulihad existed south of Cape Kumari. During a violent irruption of the sea, themountain Kumarikoddu and the whole of the country through which flowed thePrahuli had disappeared.26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn26]Kanakasabhai’s sources include the Kalittogai (stanza 104:1–4) and theSilipa-thikaram (xx: 17–20): ‘The river Prahuli, and the mountain Kumari,surrounded by many hills, were submerged by the raging sea.’27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn27] Adiyarkkunelar fills in some ofthe detail when he tells us that in the time before the flood these forested andpopulated lands between the Prahuli and Kumari rivers were divided into 49counties that stretched for ‘700 Kavathams’ – about 1000 miles.28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn28]The historian P. Ramanathan also draws attention to ‘ancient Tamil poems andauthentic traditions [that] refer to successive submersions of land to the southof India in the Indian Ocean and the consequent reduction of the extent of theTamil land’:29 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn29]Purunanuru 6 by Karikishar and Purunanuru 9 by Nettimaiyar … refer to Kumari andPrahuli rivers both placed by ancient commentators in the submerged lands to thesouth of Cape Comorin [modern Kaniya Kumari]. Kalittogai 104 specifically refersto [a Pandyan king] losing his territories to the sea and compensating the lossby conquering new territories from the Chera and Chola rulers (to the north).Silapathikaram – Kadukankathai (lines 18–23) refers to the sea swallowing up thePrahuli river along with Kumarikoddu tract comprising many hill areas. TheVenirkathai of Silipathikaram refers to the ocean as the southernmost frontierof Tamilaham and commentator Adiyarkkunelar explains that the reference there isto the topography after the deluge. The Payiram to the Tolkappiyam refers toVenkatam as the northern boundary and [Kaniya] Kumari as the southern boundaryof Tamilaham. In his commentary thereon Illampuranar states that the southernboundary (viz Kumari) was mentioned because, before submersion by the sea therewere lands to the south of Kumari … In his commentary on the Tolkappiyam,Nachinarkkiniyar mentions that the sea submerged 49 Nadus (counties) south ofKumari river …30 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn30]Ramanathan further reminds us that, according to tradition, the Pandyans are:the oldest of the three ancient Tamil dynasties. Perhaps the oldest rulingdynasty in the world … Some accounts … say that Cheras and Cholas were merebranches of the Pandyan dynasty which separated long ago.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn31]He then repeats essentially the assertion of the Kalittogai cited above that:One of the earliest Pandyan kings, Nediyon (‘the tall one’) is said to haveorganized the worship of the sea. Portions of his land to the south of CapeComorin [Kaniya Kumari] were submerged by the sea and to compensate for the losshe conquered vast territories to the north of the Pandyan kingdom.32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn32]Likewise, T. R. Sesha Iyenagar refers to Tamil traditions which suggest that,although Kumari Kandam may have included islands, a large part of it wasmainlandconnected with South India … which was overwhelmed and submerged by a hugedeluge. There are unmistakable indications in the Tamil traditions that the landaffected by the deluge was contiguous with Tamilaham, and that, after thesubsidence, the Tamils naturally betook themselves to their northernprovinces.33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn33]What secrets lie concealed in such fragments of folklore and tradition? In hispaper ‘The Cultural Heritage of the Ancient Tamils’, Dr M. Sundaram, ChiefProfessor and Head of the Department of Tamil, Presidency College, Madras, sumsup the evidence to conclude that:The tradition of the loss of a vast continent by a deluge of the sea is toostrong in the ancient Tamil classics to be ignored by any serious type ofenquiry. In fact the first Tamil Sangam was said to have been functioning fromSouth Madurai, in the lost continent. Ancient grammatical texts in Tamil andtheir latter day commentators testify that River Prahuli and Kumari Mountainranges were lost by a deluge, a Purunaruli verse refers to the River Prahuli andSilipathikaram mentions the deluge in which the Kumari continent was lost …There were 49 divisions between River Prahuli and mountain Kumari. The eruditecommentator of Tolkappiyam, Per-Asiriyar, has stated that the Kumari river wasleft as Cape Kumari after a deluge.34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn34]Last but by no means least, the Tamil epic Manimekalai speaks of the flooding ofa city off-shore of Poompuhur as divine retribution upon a king who had failedto celebrate the festival of Indra.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn35] Most archaeologists believe thatthe reference here is to the shallowly submerged ruins of the historical city ofKaveripumpattinam found just south of Poompuhur in the intertidal zone mainly at3 metres or less and dated to between 300 BC and AD 300 (see chapter 9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09]). However, the U-shaped structure thatis now known to lie much further out from shore and in deeper water raises thepossibility that what is remembered in the Manimekalai could be a far earlierevent.RAVANA’S ANTEDILUVIAN DOMAINIf the Kumari Kandam tradition is in any way a true guide then we should expectto find underwater ruins not only in south Indian waters, but also in the watersof the island of Sri Lanka – ancient Ceylon. And because Sri Lanka was joined tothe mainland during the Ice Age by a land-bridge close to Poompuhur (indeed,would have been an integral part of ‘Kumari Kandam’) logic suggests that SriLankan myths and legends should also have something to say on the subject offloods.It is therefore reassuring to discover that the Mahavamsa, Dipavamsa andRajavali, Ceylonese chronicles based on archaic oral sources that first began tobe set down in writing by Buddhist monks around the fourth century AD,36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn36] ‘speak of three deluges whichdestroyed a large land area that lay beyond Ceylon’.37[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn37] For example the Rajavaliremembers a time, long before its own compilation as a text, whenthe gods who were charged with the conservation of Ceylon became enraged andcaused the sea to deluge the land … In this time … 100,000 large towns, 970fishers’ villages and 400 villages inhabited by pearl fishers … were swallowedup by the sea …38 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn38] Twenty miles ofthe coast, extending inland [were] washed away.39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn39]The same source also refers to a flood that affected Sri Lanka even earlier –indeed ‘in a former age’40 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn40] –during the time of the giant Ravana (the ‘demon king’ whose exploits feature,separately, in the Indian Sanskrit epic, the Ramayana). Ravana, it seems, hadangered the gods with his ‘impiety’ and was punished in the usual way:The citadel of Ravana, 25 palaces and 400,000 streets, were swallowed up by thesea … The submerged land was between Tuticorin [south-east coast of modern TamilNadu] and Mannar [north-west coast of modern Sri Lanka] and the island of Mannaris all that is now left of what was once a large territory.41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn41]I was later to realize that there is something remarkable about this. InDecember 2000 when I was first able to study Glenn Milne’s inundation maps ofthe Poompuhur region, I noticed that a large tract of land would indeed havebeen exposed between Tuticorin and Mannar – just as the chronicle said – ataround 16,000 years ago. This was soon after the end of the Last GlacialMaximum, shortly before global sea-level began to rise steeply, and Milne’s mapsgo on to show the flooding of Ravana’s antediluvian domain by the post-glacialfloods. Interestingly, the maps also show an area of higher relief that wasnever submerged and that is today, as the Rajavali correctly reports, the islandof Mannar.42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn42][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_062_r1.jpg]Sir J. E. Tennant, among others who wrote long before the era of inundationmapping, disregarded ‘the traditions of the former extent of Ceylon andsubmersion of vast regions by the sea’ on the grounds that ‘evidence is wantingto corroborate the assertion, at least within the historic period’.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn43] But once again, as we now know,there is abundant evidence that before the historic period, at the end of theIce Age, Sri Lanka was indeed much larger than it is today with the greatestextent of antediluvian land in the north-west bridging the Gulf of Mannarexactly where, ‘in a former age’, Ravana’s citadel is supposed to have stood.16,000 BC TO 9600 BCThis notion of earlier flood epochs – with the parallel thought of layer uponlayer of forgotten history receding deep into a past beyond remembrance – isreinforced in certain Ceylonese traditions about the ancient Tamils. Amongstthese an intriguing statement is made that the total number of Sangams was notthree, as most other accounts maintain, but seven44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn44] – implying the existence atunknown locations of four previous Sangams before the First Sangam set up itsheadquarters at Tenmadurai on the banks of the Prahuli river.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn45]In this connection I note that N. Mahalingam, Chairman of the InternationalAssociation of Tamil Studies, refers in the Proceedings of the FifthInternational Conference of Tamil Studies to Tamil traditions that speak ofthree episodes of flooding in the millennia preceding the supposed foundationdate of the First Sangam:The first great deluge took place in 16,000 BC … The second one occurred in14,058 BC when parts of Kumari Kandam went under the sea. The third one happenedin 9564 BC when a large part of Kumari Kandam was submerged.46[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn46]The date for the third of these archaic floods, as readers will note, overlaps,give or take forty years, with the date of 9600 BC for the foundation of theFirst Sangam (and thus also with Plato’s date for the submersion of Atlantis).It is only a hint, but if there is any substance to it, then it raises thepossibility that the First Sangam too, like its successors, might have beenfounded by flood survivors – perhaps even survivors of the very same episode ofglobal floods that in another ocean gave rise to the Atlantis myth.CULTS OF KNOWLEDGEAt the heart of the Sangam story, whether it concerns three or seven ancientAcademies, is a theme of entropy and degeneration, spiralling downwards througha series of stages from a golden age, powered by vast cosmic cycles ofdestruction and rebirth. There are curious echoes here of the yuga system at theheart of the Dwarka story, on the one hand, and of the Vedic notion of thepralaya – the global cataclysm that recurs at the end of each world age – on theother: * In both cases we must envisage an antediluvian civilization of high spiritual and artistic achievement and a group of sages – the Seven Rishis in the case of the Vedas, the members of the ‘Academy’ in the case of the Tamil texts – who gather to serve the interests of knowledge and to provide an archive or repository for poetic and religious compositions. * In both cases a cataclysm in the form of a global flood intervenes, swallowing up huge areas of land and destroying the antediluvian civilization. * In both cases survivors repromulgate the ancient knowledge in the new age – which is portrayed as a decline from the age before – forming a new group of Seven Rishis or a new Sangam suitable to that age.Needless to say there are many differences between the two traditions – too manyfor either to be the result of direct influence from the other. Nevertheless,the underlying idea is essentially the same – that recurrent cataclysms afflictthe earth, threatening the obliteration of human knowledge and a return toignorance, but that an institution or ‘brotherhood’ (the Seven Rishis, theSangam) survives ‘the periodic scourge of the deluge’ and rises again after therecession of the waters to carry the cause of knowledge forwards into the newage and to ‘bring glory and light to ignorant lands and peoples’.47[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn47]There are also prominent crossover figures suggestive of an unseen link. Forexample, the Sage Agastya, frequently listed amongst or alongside the VedicSeven Sages, appears in Tamil traditions as a member of the First Sangam.Likewise, listed amongst the 549 members of the First Sangam is the Vedic godRudra-Siva, master of animals, Lord of Yoga, ‘he of the braided hair’. And whilehis presence there may well, as Pillai argues, be just an outcome of Tamil‘fabulists’ seeking to concoct a divine heritage for their work, it is worthremembering that Siva’s primary attribute is gnosis – or knowledge – and thatwhether in south India or the Himalayas he is associated with a cult of esotericknowledge that is said to have been carried down from before the flood.THE TANK AND THE PILLARSiva is everywhere in Madurai and stories of his deeds and miracles abound here.Even the Meenakshi temple is in fact two temples within a single walled complex– one, the smaller of the two, for the goddess Meenakshi, a wife of Siva, andone for Siva himself in his manifestation as Sundareshwar. The temple sits atthe ancient geometrical centre of Madurai, occupying an area measuringapproximately 220 × 260 metres48 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn48]– as large as the footprint of the Great Pyramid of Egypt.49[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn49] Its perimeter is embellished witheleven spectacular gopurams (entrance towers – the highest, in the south, risingto more than 50 metres), all of them luridly carved and painted with sensationalthree-dimensional scenes from Hindu mythology. Such scenes, made up of anestimated total of 33 million carvings,50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn50] crowd in everywhere upon thevisitor who approaches this vast complex of buildings – from the walls of itsmedieval stone gateways to the columns of its Thousand Pillar Hall.The temple is not aloof from the great city that surrounds it, but rather thelife of the city continues within its walls at a different pace. Sometimes ithas the atmosphere of a market with colourful, noisy crowds bustling from shrineto shrine, beggars seeking alms, hawkers selling souvenirs and long-horned cowswandering about as though they own the place. It is surprising how often youwill see a businessman slip off his shoes to stroll inside, smear sacred ashupon his forehead and offer prayers amongst the cool shadows and garlandedstatues. Lean pilgrims and wild-haired sadhus gather from all parts of Indiaseeking alms and enlightenment, couples and families come here on outings, andclasses of schoolchildren march bright-eyed through the corridors, adding theirshrill laughter to the non-stop hubbub of conversation and chanting.I entered through the southern gopuram and made my way across a sunlitambulatory to the nearby Citra Mandapa, an elegant cloistered colonnade withpainted walls and ceilings surrounding the Golden Lotus Tank – perhaps theMeenakshi temple’s most spectacular feature. Legend has it that this very largetank, which measures 52 metres long by 36.5 metres wide, was ‘used to judge themerits of Tamil literary works’ during the Third Sangam period.51[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn51] The manuscripts that floated wereconsidered great works of literature, and if they sank they were dismissed.’52[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn52]In terms of general appearance and design the tank strikingly resembles theGreat Bath at Mohenjodaro – only there the rectangular ritual bathing pool hasbeen empty and dry for thousands of years; here it is filled with green waterand is still used by pilgrims for purification ceremonies. Much of the temple aswe see it today dates from the thirteen century AD or later – while theIndus-Sarasvati cities had fallen into ruin by the second millennium BC – but Iknew that the tank ‘prominently figures in legends connected with the origin ofthe shrine’.53 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn53] As atTiruvannamalai these legends also state that the temple stands where it doesbecause of the prior existence there of a sthala or pillar of natural stone – aSivalingam – that had manifested in primordial times. In the case of Madurai,however, the pillar did not appear at the foot of a sacred mountain but wasfound standing upright in a forest ‘beneath a Kadamba tree’ where the Vedic godIndra was said to have built the first prehistoric shrine around it.54[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn54][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_063_r1.jpg]Floorplan of Madurai temple. Based on Howley and Dasa (1996).I was reminded of the cylindrical and conical stone pillars (of officially‘unknown’, but I would have thought obvious, function) that have been excavatedby archaeologists along the valleys of the Indus and the Sarasvati rivers atnumerous Harappan and pre-Harappan sites.55[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn55] These ‘proto-Sivalinga’ areantedated by even earlier stone pillars of the same sort excavated fromNeolithic settlements in India56 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn56]– so many of them that T. R. Sesha Iyenagar can write: ‘the worship of Siva inthe form of a linga existed in the Stone Age, which certainly preceded the VedicAge’.57 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn57]The truth is that nobody really knows when the ‘Vedic Age’ began just as nobodyhas yet found the beginning of the Siva cult in India. Powerful and omnipresentfrom the Himalayas to the deep south, it always seems to have existed – in theworship of the lingam, in the worship of the sacred mountain, in the worship ofthe god of yoga and knowledge, cross-legged, deep in meditation, surrounded bywild beasts.This enigmatic figure, and the complex system of ideas and symbols that heevokes, must have come from somewhere.Perhaps Kumari Kandam?LOOK SOUTH‘It was the most ancient continent in the whole world,’ exclaimed Dr T. N. P.Haran, Professor of Tamil Studies at the American College in Madurai. ‘The bestand the ancient civilization existed there. And it belongs to Tamils.’‘And if I wanted to find it – whatever’s left of it – where would I have tolook?’‘Kumari Kandam was a big land. So many people were there. The sea came in and itswallowed the whole thing.’‘If I were to go diving off modern Kaniya Kumari, do you think I’d find ruins?’‘I’ve no idea! But I wish you all the best!’I persisted: ‘Should I look directly south of Kaniya Kumari?’Haran thought for a while before replying: ‘Yes, I think at least 300 kilometressouth of Kaniya Kumari. If you go there you will be able to get something.’WHAT FISHERMEN KNOWBefore returning to dive with the NIO at Dwarka at the beginning of March 2000(reported in chapter 9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09]) Santha and Icompleted the rest of our long overland journey in Tamil Nadu with visits tofour coastal towns: Kaniya Kumari in the south, Rameswaram in the south-east,where India reaches out towards Sri Lanka across the Palk Strait, and Poompuhurand Mahabalipuram along the Coromandel coast facing the Bay of Bengal. * Mahabalipuram commands attention on account of the old myths of the Seven Pagodas and the sunken city of Bali (see chapter 5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05]). * Kaniya Kumari is explicitly referenced in the Kumari Kandam tradition as the new southern border of India after the hilly and well-watered land that formerly lay to the south of it had been swept away in the deluge. * Rameswaram is identified in the Ramayana with what sounds like a land-bridge to Sri Lanka: ‘To build a bridge across the sea, the bears and monkeys hurled trees and rocks into the water which by the power of Rama remained afloat. The Gods looked down enthralled as the monkey armies moved across the sea on Rama’s bridge.’58 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn58] (The ‘monkey armies’ – don’t ask, it’s a long story! – are on their way to Lanka to rescue Rama’s wife Sita from Ravana, the same demon king of a ‘former age’ whose antediluvian domain is said in the Ceylonese Chronicles to have stretched between Tuticorin and Mannar. So much land-bridge imagery, from two different traditions, and in just the right places!) [images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_064_r1.jpg] * Poompuhur speaks for itself as the site of the submerged U-shaped structure. When I went there in February 2000 I knew that diving would be out of the question without going through a long permissions and money rigmarole with the NIO first. But I wanted to get a sense of the land side of the story and at least dip my toes in the water.As we explored and talked to more and more local people it began to dawn on methat the ubiquitous south Indian traditions of lost lands and flooded cities –which so many scholars simply ignore in their evaluation of history – are wellknown and almost universally believed to be true accounts by the general publicof the region.This in itself does not necessarily mean anything. Superstitions and folliesabound amongst the public in every country. But many of my informants werehard-bitten professional fishermen who for the most part were clearly notrelaying half-remembered folklore that they had heard from their grandfathers,but were speaking from direct personal experience. Indeed, in Poompuhur andagain in Mahabalipuram I met fishermen, who had nothing whatsoever to gain bydeceiving me, who claimed to have seen with their own eyes what they describedas ‘palaces’, or ‘temples’, or ‘walls’ or ‘roads’ underwater when diving down tofree trapped anchors or nets.An underwater ruin, if it is of any size, will function as an artificial reef,attracting many different species of fish to the shelter and security that itprovides – particularly in areas like south-east India, where the sea bottom islargely flat and featureless. And since fishermen are in the business ofcatching fish, they naturally look out for places in the ocean where fishcongregate for any reason. In this way they are often the first to findunsuspected underwater sites – and frequently may know of sites thatarchaeologists are unaware of.My instinct is that this may well turn out to be the case along extensivestretches of the south Indian continental shelf which, except off Poompuhur, hasnever been the subject of a marine archaeological survey. My travels from KaniyaKumari to Mahabalipuram have convinced me that the local sightings of anomaloussubmerged structures in these areas are too numerous, too consistent and toowidespread to be safely ignored. Moreover, were it not for the NIO, no marinearchaeology at all would have been attempted anywhere in the region. It istherefore surely significant that in the one place where the NIO has looked –Poompuhur – something as unusual as the U-shaped structure was found in aproject lasting just a few days. It makes sense to suppose that if furthersystematic surveys and marine archaeology can be done underwater – at Poompuhurand at the other south Indian locations – then more discoveries are likely to bemade …At Mahabalipuram, in the little fishing village that lies in the curve of thebay a mile or so to the north of the Shore temple, Santha and I sat on the beachon a pile of drying nets with a large crowd gathering around us. Everybody inthe village who might have an opinion or information to contribute was there,including all the fishermen – some of whom had been drinking palm toddy most ofthe afternoon and were in a boisterous and argumentative mood. What they werearguing about were their answers to the questions that I was asking andprecisely who had seen what, where underwater – so I was happy to listen totheir animated conversations and disagreements.An elder with wrinkled, nut-brown eyes and grey hair bleached white by longexposure to the sun and sea spoke at length about a structure with columns whichhe had seen one day from his boat when the water had been exceptionally clear.‘There was a big fish,’ he told me. ‘A red fish. I watched it swimming towardssome rocks. Then I realized that they were not rocks but a temple. The fishdisappeared into the temple, then it appeared again, and I saw that it wasswimming in and out of a row of columns.’‘Are you certain it was a temple?’ I asked.‘Of course it was a temple,’ my informant replied. He pointed to the pyramidalgranite pagoda of the Shore temple: ‘it looked like that.’Several of the younger men had the usual stories to tell about heroic scarydives – lasting minutes, hearts thudding, their breath bursting in their lungs –to free fishing gear snagged on dark and treacherous underwater buildings. Inone case, it seemed, a huge net had become so thoroughly entrapped on such astructure that the trawler that was towing it had been stopped in its tracks. Inthe case of another underwater ruin divers had seen a doorway leading into aninternal room but had been afraid to enter it.One strange report was that certain of the ruins close to Mahabalipuram emit‘clanging’ or ‘booming’ or musical sounds if the sea conditions are right: ‘Itis like the sound of a great sheet of metal being struck.’‘And what about further away,’ I asked. ‘If I were to take a boat southfollowing the coast what would I find? Are the underwater structures mainly justhere around Mahabalipuram or are they spread out?’‘As far south as Rameswaram you may find ruins underwater,’ said one of theelders. ‘I have fished there. I have seen them.’Others had not travelled so far but all agreed that within their experiencethere were submerged structures everywhere along the coast: ‘If you just gowhere the fish are then you will find them.’WHICH SITE TO DIVE ON?If I had unlimited funds and complete freedom of action then I would long agohave organized full-scale marine archaeological expeditions at Kaniya Kumari,Rameswaram, Poompuhur and Mahabalipuram in the south and south-east of India,and all along the coast of the Gujerat peninsula and the Gulfs of Kutch andCambay in the north-west. But I don’t have unlimited funds – or time – andIndia, for all her magnetism, is a vast challenge and energy drain bestapproached with a flexible schedule and a spirit of compromise.Besides, India is one facet of ‘Underworld’, not the whole mystery. Afterreturning to England in March 2000, with the Dwarka dives behind me, I could notafford to forget that other research was also crying out to be completed andthat other journeys had to be made – at the very least to the Maldives, thePersian Gulf, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and Japan. Although I had nointention of abandoning the wider investigation in India I therefore decidedthat for the immediate future I would focus my energies on getting to dive atPoompuhur – which I had already begun to negotiate with Kamlesh Vora beforeleaving Dwarka – and that all the other potential Indian dive sites would haveto wait their turn.Poompuhur was the obvious first choice, head and shoulders above the othercontenders. Here alone advance work had been done by the NIO, who, quiteextraordinarily and with absolutely no fanfare, appeared to have found preciselywhat I was looking for – viz. a large, well-organized and apparently man-madestructure that had been inundated more than 10,000 years ago at a time whenthere was no known civilization in the vicinity that could have built it.While keeping the money and permissions process going with the NIO by e-mail, Iused the next several months to complete an intensive series of research anddiving trips to Malta, Alexandria, the Balearic islands, the Canary islands andtwice to Japan (once in April/May for seven weeks and again in September for afurther two weeks).By October 2000 my attention was very much back on Poompuhur again, when GlennMilne’s calculations arrived showing that the U-shaped structure was in fact‘11,000 years old or older’ – putting its inundation squarely in the sametime-frame as the supposedly mythical foundation of the First Sangam atTenmadurai, and as the supposedly mythical submersion of Plato’s Atlantis.The next development came in December 2000 when Milne supplied me with a seriesof high-resolution inundation maps of India, spanning the period between 21,300years ago and 4800 years ago, which tracked the changes in the subcontinent’scoastline caused by rising sea-levels during the meltdown of the Ice Age (seechapter 7 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07]). The maps show not only thehuge amounts of land that antediluvian India surrendered to the rising seas buthow practical a proposition it is that an unidentified high culture – orcultures – of Indian antiquity could have been lost to archaeology during thisperiod.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_065_r1.jpg]In December 2000 I also received confirmation from the NIO that permission hadat last been granted for me to dive at Poompuhur. The trip could take place inFebruary 2001 – exactly a year after my previous visit. Mercifully, the finalarrangements and negotiations (and the money that had to be paid to the NIO) hadbeen taken over on my behalf by a film crew from Channel 4 TV in Britain whowere now covering my story. I welcomed the fact that whatever the NIO had toshow me at Poompuhur would be documented properly for television. I wasconvinced that only by allowing the greatest number of people to see theU-shaped structure for themselves and to make up their own minds about it did itstand a chance of getting the attention it deserved from the archaeologists whohad hitherto ignored it.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_066_r1.jpg]UNFOLDING THE INDIAN FLOODSIn January 2001 Glenn Milne, who had been working overtime, sent me more Indianmaps – a complete sequence of high-resolution inundation simulations for 21,300years ago; 16,400 years ago; 13,500 years ago; 12,400 years ago; 10,600 yearsago; 8900 years ago; 7700 years ago; 6900 years ago.Although I had a rough idea of what to expect, it was still a revelation to fliprapidly through these maps from the oldest to the youngest and watch the entireprocess of the post-glacial inundation of India unfold before my eyes. What Ifound most striking of all, however, was the way in which the two areas rich inflood myths where underwater ruins had already been found – off the coast ofGujerat in the north-west and off the coast of Tamil Nadu in the south-east-were also the two areas most clearly flagged by Glenn Milne’s maps as large andcontinuous antediluvian habitats in which it was conceivable that Ice Agecivilizations could have flourished.Moreover, now that I had the maps at virtually millennium intervals, it waspossible to pinpoint periods when the extent of the ongoing loss of land to thesea had been particularly rapid and to note any correlation between these and(1) John Shaw’s cataclysmic chronology for the post-glacial floods; (2) therelevant mythology; and (3) the accepted dates for the so-called ‘Neolithicrevolution’ in India (i.e., the beginnings of food production at Mehrgarh andother sites).THE NORTH-WESTIn the north-west, around Gujerat, the maps show that a huge land area wasinundated between approximately 17,000 and 7000 years ago – an area contiguousto the domain in which archaeologists believe that the first recognizable rootsof the Indus-Sarasvati civilization were planted during the last three millenniaof the same period. As we saw in chapter 7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07], the submerged lands are at their mostextensive around the modern Gulf of Cambay – south of which the map for 16,400years ago shows an extensive depression, very likely to have been filled with alarge freshwater lake, bounded by a further tract of land at least 100kilometres wide and beyond that the Arabian Sea.The next map in the sequence – 13,500 years ago – reveals that major changesoccurred during the intervening 2900 years. The landmass around the Gulf ofCambay was much reduced in area and a large island, almost 500 kilometres longand 100 kilometres wide at its midpoint, was marooned off-shore in the ArabianSea. Between the island and the mainland a marine strait, also 100 kilometreswide in some places, opened up through the basin of the former freshwater lake.These rather dramatic land-losses between 16,400 and 13,500 years ago correlatewell with the first of John Shaw’s proposed episodes of global superfloods,which falls midway through the period at around 15,000 years ago.Over the next 6000 years – between 13,500 years ago and 7700 years ago – themaps show that the large off-shore island and the coastal strip masking theoutline of the Gujerat peninsula were continually nibbled away at by the risingseas, but that these events were gradual, extended over many lifetimes, andwould have been unlikely to have been perceived as cataclysmic. As late as 7700years ago the Gulf of Cambay was still the ‘pleasant valley’ that it had been,uninterrupted, since at least the Last Glacial Maximum and the island lyingoff-shore, though reduced, was still of formidable size – perhaps 300 kilometresin length and close to 80 kilometres wide.This pattern for the Gujerat area, therefore, does not correlate well with thesecond of John Shaw’s proposed episodes of global superfloods around 11,000years ago. Nor does it suggest a motive for any memorable panic-migration offlood refugees out of this area at any point during this period – whichstraddles the supposed date of around 9000 years ago for the first settlement ofMehrgarh.What happens next, however, provides a close match to Shaw’s chronology ofaround 8000 years ago for the third flood. The maps for 7700 years ago and 6900years ago show that in this relatively short period of 800 years the largeremnant island below the Gulf of Cambay was completely wiped off the map and theGulf itself was fully and permanently inundated to its modern extent. For anyhypothetical coastal culture that had been forced to retreat and compact intothe Gulf’s pleasant valley over the previous 6000 years, or that had lived onthe island, it goes without saying that these events would have been more thancataclysmic.They would have looked like the end of the world.THE SOUTHAs we would expect, the inundation maps for 21,300 years ago and 16,400 yearsago show that few significant coastline changes took place in the south duringthe five millennia or so of the Last Glacial Maximum. At that time Sri Lanka wasjoined to the mainland, as we have seen, and ‘a substantial integrated area – anentire sub-region of India’ that is today submerged59[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn59] – was above water in the southand the south-east (and indeed all along the Malabar coast in the west also).This lost antediluvian realm accords extremely well in a general sense with thecentral claim of the Kumari Kandam tradition that a large landmass did existaround the south of India in ancient times and that it was swallowed up by thesea in a series of floods.The maps of 21,300 and 16,400 years ago reveal the full extent of thecontinental shelf that was exposed during the Ice Age, but a specific feature ofgreat interest is the snout-shaped peninsula shown to have extendedapproximately 150 kilometres southwards into the Indian Ocean below modernKaniya Kumari. As the reader will recall, such a peninsula in exactly thislocation is spoken of in the Kumari Kandam tradition:In former days the land … extended further south and … a mountain calledKumarikoddu, and a large tract of country watered by the river Prahuli hadexisted south of Cape Kumari. During a violent irruption of the sea the mountainKumarikoddu and the whole of the country through which flowed the Prahuli…disappeared.60 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn60]The peninsula that Glenn Milne’s calculations place on the inundation maps isnot as large as the one described in the tradition (which was said to have been‘ 700 Kavathams’, about 1500 kilometres, in length). Still it is there –precisely where the Kumari Kandam tradition says it should be, and in thecorrect time-frame. Moreover, the maps show another antediluvian landmass thathas also for the most part disappeared beneath the waves standing in the openocean to the south-west – the greatly enlarged Maldive islands as they looked atthe Last Glacial Maximum.What if the civilization of Kumari Kandam had been partially based along thecoastal margins of southern India and Sri Lanka and partially on theantediluvian Maldives archipelago? If so, then the idea that Kumari Kandam onceextended 1500 kilometres to the south of Kanya Kumari does not seem sofar-fetched. Nor does the notion that a civilization that had once existed inthis area could have been destroyed by recurrent cycles of catastrophic floods.The tradition says that the last of these floods occurred 3500 years ago(supposedly the flood that destroyed the Second Sangam at Kavatapuram), and theone preceding it 7200 years ago (supposedly the flood that destroyed the FirstSangam at Tenmadurai). In addition N. Mahalingam has cited further Tamil sourcesthat speak of earlier floods: one around the date of foundation of the FirstSangam, approximately 9600 years ago, one just over 16,000 years ago and theearliest 18,000 years ago.61 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn61]Once again there is a good general correlation between what scientists now knowabout the meltdown of the Ice Age (particularly the episodic and recurrentnature of the post-glacial floods) and what the Kumari Kandam tradition claimswas happening in the world in precisely the same period (episodic and recurrentfloods). There is by no means one-to-one agreement on the dates at whichparticularly severe inundations occurred – as is to be expected given themargins of inaccuracy that surround the estimating processes used by both Shawand Milne, not to mention the scope for error and exaggeration in the traditionitself. Still, there is more than enough agreement on the general course ofevents to give us pause for thought. After all, how many times can we reasonablycry ‘coincidence’ when the medieval Tamil ‘fabulists’ keep on getting theirpalaeogeography right? Or did they in fact – as Shivaraja Pillai askssarcastically – ‘come upon some secret archive which had escaped the deluge’?62[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn62]Glenn Milne’s inundation map for 13,500 years ago shows a dramatic change in thesouth Indian landscape since the previous map of 16,400 years ago: the coastalmargins have been greatly reduced and the peninsula below Kaniya Kumari has beensevered by the sea, leaving an island off-shore. In the Indian Ocean to thesouth-west the land area of the antediluvian Maldives archipelago has beenreduced almost by half.The map for 12,400 years ago shows little significant change, but in the map for10,600 years ago the island to the south of Kaniya Kumari has been reduced to adot, the Maldives have been further ravaged, and, for the first time, a neck ofsea is shown separating Tuticorin on the mainland and Mannar in what is now SriLanka. This incursion seems very close to what is described in the Sri Lankanmyth of the flooding of Ravana’s kingdom (said to have extended betweenTuticorin and Mannar ‘in a former age’).63[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn63] Moreover, the timing – between12,400 and 10,600 years ago – coincides with Glenn Milne’s date for thesubmersion of the U-shaped structure at Poompuhur and accords well with thesecond of John Shaw’s episodes of post-glacial flooding around 11,000 years ago.The map of 8900 years ago shows further minor erosion all around the southIndian coastal strip and a deepening of the marine incursion beyond Tuticorinand Mannar into what is now a bay beneath the war-torn Jaffna peninsula.However, the Palk Strait was still dry land 8900 years ago and, though muchdiminished in size, the land-bridge connecting Jaffna to the mainland was stillin place at that date (and indeed was to remain there for another thousandyears).On John Shaw’s estimates, the third of the three great episodes of post-glacialflooding was unleashed on the world’s oceans around 8000 years ago – and we haveseen how this correlates well with what happened at around that time when theGulf of Cambay and neighbouring areas of the north-west of India were rapidlyinundated. In the south-east the inundation maps show that in the same periodbetween 7700 and 6900 years ago there was also significant further inundation ofthe Maldives, while the land-bridge between Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu, which hadclung on for so long, was at last swallowed up by the sea -leaving India lookingvery much as it does today.OCCAM’S RAZORWhat are we to conclude about the Kumari Kandam myth?In some respects there is no doubt that it has proved eerily, stunninglyaccurate. On the other hand much of it sounds wildly improbable and in placesobviously ‘manufactured’. For example, when one studies the way numbers are usedin the myth (something that I have not sought to tax the reader with here)certain obvious patterns emerge that are more suggestive of a mathematical game,or code, than of true reports of the number of members of, or the number ofroyal patrons of, or the duration of this or that Sangam.It will be recalled that the durations of the three Sangams were said to be 4440years for the First Sangam, 3700 years for the Second Sangam and 1850 years forthe Third Sangam.64 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn64] It isobviously not an accident that each of these numbers is a multiple of 37 (120x37= 4440; 100x37 = 3700; 50x37 = 1850).65[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn65] What the significance or purposeof this pattern is I cannot begin to guess, but it means that the chronology ofthe myth is suspect and cannot be treated as a reliable historical record.Still, it does not follow from this and other criticisms that the whole mythmust be tossed in the dustbin of history and forgotten – as it has been by mostscholars. Although wildly out of line on some of the details and dates, the mythis right in the broad sweep. It is right that India’s Dravidian peninsula wasformerly much bigger than it is today. It is right that a series of huge delugesoccurred over a period of several thousand years and that these swallowed up theantediluvian lands in stages. And the myth selects the correct epoch – smack inthe middle of the post-glacial floods around 11,600 years ago – in which to setits flood story.Besides, whatever one thinks of myths (and most historians and archaeologistsregard them as useless to scientific inquiry)66[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn66] there is the awkward andinescapable archaeological fact of the U-shaped structure 23 metres underwaterand 5 kilometres off-shore of Poompuhur – a structure that is ‘11,000 years oldor older’.67 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-ftn67] Isn’t the mostparsimonious way to explain its presence there the very one that the myth itselfprovides – namely, that a civilization of former times once flourished in thisregion but was swallowed up by the sea?I could only learn more by diving."},{"pageContent":"12 / THE HIDDEN YEARSThe period dreadful for the universe has come. Make for thyself a strong ship,with a cable attached; embark in it with the Seven Sages and stow in it,carefully preserved and assorted, all the seeds which have been described of old…Satpatha BrahmanaAn epoch of spectacular geological turmoil occurred at the end of the last IceAge, with the most dramatic effects registered in a series of cataclysmic floodsthat took place at intervals between roughly 15,000 and 7000 years ago. Is it anaccident that this same 8000-year period has been pinpointed by archaeologistsas the very one in which our supposedly primitive forefathers made thetransition (in different places at somewhat different times) from their age-oldhunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled agriculture? Or could there be more to ‘thefood-producing revolution’ than meets the eye? After all, most scientistsalready recognize a causative connection between the end of the Ice Age and thesupposed beginning of farming – indeed an unproven hypothesis that rapid climatechanges forced hunter-gatherers to invent agriculture presently serves as prettymuch the sum of conventional wisdom on this subject.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-ftn1]But there is another possibility. Nobody seems to have noticed that in thegeneral vicinity of each of the places in the world where the food-producingrevolution is supposed to have begun between 15,000 and 7000 years ago there isalso a large area of land that was submerged by the post-glacial floods between15,000 and 7000 years ago: * We have seen that this is true for India, one of the world’s ancient agricultural ‘hearths’,2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-ftn2] which lost more than a million square kilometres in the south and the west and, most conspicuously in the north-west, at the end of the Ice Age. * It is true for China and for south-east Asia, both important centres of palaeo-agriculture. Immediately adjacent to them, but now under as much as 100 metres of water, lies the Ice Age continent of Sundaland. Prior to its final inundation of about 8000 years ago, this consisted of more than 3 million square kilometres of prime antediluvian real estate extending from the Malaysian peninsula through what are now the Indonesian islands and the Philippines. Taiwan was incorporated with the Chinese mainland and northwards from there the coast expanded almost 1000 kilometres to the east to fill what is now the Yellow Sea and incorporate the Korean peninsula fully with the mainland. [images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_067_r1.jpg] [images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_067a_r1.jpg] * It is true for the so-called Fertile Crescent – the prime agricultural ‘hearth’ of the Middle East, centred around lands watered by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, that forms a rough semi-circle through parts of modern Israel, the Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran and ends up near the Persian Gulf. For not only was the Gulf previously dry – and flooded at the end of the Ice Age, as we saw in chapter 2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02] – but a glance at the wider map also shows several other inundated areas near by in the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and the eastern Mediterranean. * And it is true for Central America, where agriculture is thought to have sprung up spontaneously, independent of developments in the Old World. Off the Gulf of Mexico, the Yucatan, Nicaragua, Florida and Grand Bahama Banks were imposing landmasses during the Ice Age that were swallowed by the post-glacial floods around 7000 years ago. Evidence from Mexico and Panama, published in July 2001, indicates that ‘agriculture in the Americas began around 7000 years ago’. It is notable that: ‘On the Gulf coast pollen evidence suggests that forest was being cleared around 5100 BC and domesticated maize plants were being grown only a century later … The San Andres site near the famous Olmec centre of La Venta showed that maize had been introduced and grown in a region of beaches and lagoons.’3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-ftn3]My curiosity about coincidences like these developed as I researched Underworld- because the sudden appearance of village farming communities at the end of theIce Age was the first step on the road to modern civilization (so the stakes inthis inquiry are high), and because the Ice Age lands that went under the seacover an area of more than 25 million square kilometres of the earth’s surfacewhere, for obvious practical reasons, almost no archaeology has ever been done(so important evidence could very easily have gone undetected). Since many ofthe coastal lands that were inundated would have offered desirable refugia frominhospitable and unpredictable Ice Age conditions, the possibility surely has tobe considered that the real story of the origins of food production and ofcivilization may yet await discovery because the evidence is underwater.I decided to explore this neglected possibility with all the resources at mydisposal, knowing when I did so that it would commit me to an exhausting andexpensive schedule of travel and diving – much of which might prove fruitless –and that I would have to enter arcane areas of inquiry, ransack obscurelibraries and rack my brains on uncompromising sciences if I was to have anyhope of success.LONG SHOTI needed a good research assistant and in August 2000 I found one – Sharif Sakr,who has proved to be the very best of the many good researchers I have workedwith over the years. Right at the beginning, I asked Sharif to find me anauthoritative scientist at a major university who could produce high-resolutioninundation maps for us, virtually on demand, for any point on earth at any timeduring the meltdown of the Ice Age. This was the start of our long andproductive working relationship with Glenn Milne.Then, as the inundation data began to pour in during the last quarter of 2000, Iset Sharif another closely related task. This was to comb through collections ofancient maps from the sixteenth century or earlier – i.e. before the world hadbeen fully explored – to see if he could find any that showed correlations withGlenn Milne’s reconstructions of Ice Age coastlines.This touches on a problem – and a mystery – that I have long had an interest inand to which I devoted three chapters in my 1995 book Fingerprints of the Gods.To put matters at their simplest, it has been claimed by Charles Hapgood andothers that certain maps dating roughly between the fourteenth and sixteenthcenturies show Antarctica and other areas of the world not as they look today,but as they may have looked during the Ice Age when sea-levels were 120 metreslower. Moreover, many of the areas in question had not even been discovered whenthe maps were drawn (Antarctica was not discovered until the nineteenthcentury).Hapgood explains such anomalies with the suggestion that a high civilization,which was subsequently destroyed, may have existed and mapped the world tonear-modern levels of precision during the Ice Age. He further proposes thatafter the destruction of that hypothetical civilization some of the mapssurvived and were handed down from generation to generation, being copied andrecopied many times as the original materials on which they were drawn perished.Perhaps facsimiles preserved and passed on in this manner eventually ended uplodged in the great libraries of late antiquity – notably at Alexandria inEgypt, which was for a long while a world centre of navigational andastronomical science. Perhaps some of the facsimiles were amongst other salvageddocuments rescued from the fire that is said to have destroyed the Alexandrialibrary in the early centuries of the Christian era. Perhaps a handful foundshelter in other archives in the Middle East. Perhaps from there, after a fewmore centuries had passed, they were looted by Crusaders and redistributedaround the Mediterranean where their value as navigational charts was recognizedby mariners. And perhaps then, in the late thirteenth or early fourteenthcentury, a new era of copying began in which information from the highly reveredand generally accurate ancient maps was integrated with the observations andmeasurements of contemporary sailors to create navigational charts of astoundingaccuracy. Since the Mediterranean was at that time conceived of by itsinhabitants as the centre of the world, it would have been quite natural for thecopyists to focus most of their work on reproductions of the Mediterranean andneighbouring coastal regions – even if their source documents showed a far widerarea …All speculation of course. Except the part about the sudden appearance at aroundthe end of the thirteenth century, of uncannily good maps of the Mediterraneanand immediately neighbouring parts of the Atlantic. That is completely true.They are called portolans or portolanos and several hundred have come down to us– all of which, eminent cartographers are agreed, show the influence of a singlesource map, now lost, that the great map historian A. E. Nordenskiold called‘the normal portalano’. Rarer, but fortunately still also surviving, are ahandful of world maps and portions of world maps in recognizable portolan style– and it is mainly amongst these that the alleged similarities to Ice Agecoastlines and topography are observed.Many years have passed since Hapgood published his famous Maps of the AncientSea Kings in 1966 and there have been huge improvements in the technology forcalculating post-glacial sea-levels. Moreover, although he has been repeatedlyattacked and vilified by scholars who claim to have ‘debunked’ his work, theessential mystery upon which he touched remains unsolved to this day.I’m not interested in reviewing Hapgood again – read Fingerprints, or betterstill read Hapgood! But in the light of the good inundation data we now had fromGlenn Milne I asked Sharif to cast a fresh eye over some of the more intriguingancient maps that Hapgood had drawn attention to and to look for others thatmight have a bearing on the problem. I suggested he exclude Antarctica from thesearch, since I had paid enough attention to it in 1995. And on the same groundsof redundancy I told him to ignore any correlations that Hapgood himself hadalready written up. I only wanted material that hadn’t been observed and arguedabout before, that correlated well with the inundation maps, and that wassubstantial enough to withstand the rigours of hostile academic scrutiny.It seemed a lot to ask for – a real long shot – but then in February 2001 Sharife-mailed me about a map of India that he had been investigating. What wasremarkable about this 1510 Portuguese map was the fidelity and degree of detailwith which it which it portrayed areas of the Indian coast as they had lastlooked 15,000 years ago.I was already in India when I read the e-mail on my laptop on 23 February 2001.I had just flown into Tamil Nadu from the Republic of Maldives, where I hadspent four days working with the Channel 4 film crew.The same night, after we had checked into the Fisherman’s Cove hotel inMahabalipuram, where we would be filming the next morning, we receivedconfirmation from the NIO that their team had relocated the U-shaped structureat Poompuhur and would be ready to dive with us on the 26th."},{"pageContent":"13 / PYRAMID ISLANDSThe Redin came long before any other Maldivians. Between them and the presentpopulation other people had also come, but none were as potent as the Redin, andthere were many of them. They not only used sail but also oars, and thereforemoved with great speed at sea …Thor HeyerdahlRepublic of Maldives 18–23 February 2001This is the Maldives. Imagine you are flying in a specially equipped plane,under an endless blue sky over endless blue ocean … The plane is very fast andmanoeuvrable, you can go where you want in it, and yet all you see is blue -justblue above and blue below.Suddenly, in the distance, far away where the sky meets the water, your eyecatches a glint of … something on the horizon. You turn the plane towards it,skimming at 200 metres over the ocean with little waves breaking into whitehorses below you.Soon land comes into view – just a curving feather of sand no more than akilometre wide and three kilometres long, adorned with plumes of lush green palmleaves seeming to float in a sea that is now not merely blue but that gradesinto incredible shades of azure and turquoise. Passing directly overhead you seean area cleared of jungle packed with tiny houses built out of white corallinelimestone blocks and separated from one another by an orderly network of streetsbrushed with white coralline limestone sand – so that the whole Lilliputianvillage glares like a mirror in the morning sun.You take the plane higher to get a better view (remember this is an imaginaryjourney and you can go as high as a satellite if you want), and you see that thestunningly beautiful but tiny inhabited island over which you have just flown ispart of an even more stunningly beautiful ring of even tinier uninhabitedislands and sandbars also shaped as rings and crescents and ellipses. This ringin its turn reveals itself to be just one of countless other rings and crescentsand ellipses lying side by side to form a much larger ellipse in the ocean – theouter rim of a great Maldivian atoll 50 kilometres wide and more than 100kilometres long. The atoll encloses a lagoon of hardly smaller dimensions (sincethe rim islands themselves are narrow), and within the lagoon are scattereddozens more small coral islands and sandbars in which the essential patterns ofthe entire Maldives chain – circles, ellipses, crescents – repeat themselvesagain and again.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_068_r1.jpg]You urge the plane higher still, look down at last on the entire archipelagostretched out below you around the curve of the earth and discover that itconsists of an assembly of similar atolls, twenty-six of them in all, strungtogether like the pearls in a necklace and draped in the form of an elongatedellipse 754 kilometres long from north to south and 118 kilometres wide fromeast to west.Each atoll is the product of coral growth around the edges of a submergedvolcanic mountain peak:In a scenario played out over hundreds of thousands of years, coral first buildsup around the shores of a volcanic landmass producing a fringing reef. Then whenthe island, often simply the exposed peak of a submarine mountain, begins slowlyto sink, the coral continues to grow upwards at about the same rate. This formsa barrier reef which is separated from the shore of the sinking island by alagoon. By the time the island is completely submerged, the coral growth hasbecome the base for an atoll, circling the place where the volcanic landmass orisland used to be. The enclosed lagoon accumulates sand and rubble formed bybroken coral, and the level of this lagoon floor also builds up over thesubsiding landmass … Coral growth can also create reefs and islands within thelagoon …1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn1]The lagoon floors are all submerged today, but at the Last Glacial Maximum, whensea-level was lower by about 120 metres, the huge basins within each and everyone of the Maldives atolls were all dry land …You fly the plane lower again, spiralling downwards towards the sea, zooming inon one atoll, one emerald-green island. Within a beach perimeter of startlinglywhite sand it seems at first to be just thick palm jungle from one side toanother and apparently uninhabited.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_069_r1.jpg]Then you spot a clearing in the jungle less than half a kilometre from the sea.You fly closer. In the heart of the clearing, with a tree growing on its summit,is what looks like a conical hill. Closer still and you discover that the hillis not a hill at all, and it is not quite conical either.It is a ruined and partially collapsed pyramid about the height of a two-storeybuilding.THE NECKLACEThe four-day trip that we made to the Maldives immediately before returning toIndia on 23 February 2001 was not intended to be an expedition to search forunderwater ruins – hardly practicable in such a short time in an archipelago ofalmost 1200 tiny islands extending through eight degrees of latitude across90,000 square kilometres of ocean. In all that mass of blue water the total areaof dry land is presently less than 300 square kilometres and many scientists areof the opinion that even this remnant may be submerged before the end of thetwenty-first century by rising sea-levels linked to global warming.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn2]The threat of extinction that hangs over the Maldives and its unique cultureserves as a reminder that the world’s oceans can and do rise, and that when theydo they can swallow up low-lying countries – and all their history – with not atrace left visible above the water. And if that is true today, deep in what hasso far been the most placid interglacial of the past 2.5 million years, then itdoesn’t take much imagination to work out how things must have been in the worldwhen sea-levels were rising crazily between 15,000 and 7000 years ago.Besides, thanks to the ingenuity of modern science, we have inundation maps totell us the story – perhaps still not with 100 per cent accuracy (although thatis being refined all the time) but based on the best data presently available.And what the maps tell us about the Maldives is that the necklace of scatteredcoral atolls of which the archipelago now consists was almost continuous land atthe Last Glacial Maximum, broken only by intermittent channels, bays and inlets,occupying perhaps 50,000 square kilometres out of the total of 90,000 squarekilometres that the Republic presently encloses within its territorial waters.In other words, some 49,700 square kilometres of the Maldives that was abovewater between 21,000 and 16,000 years ago is underwater today.In my investigation of the riddle of Kumari Kandam I could hardly ignore thislost antediluvian landmass in the Indian Ocean that had stretched towards theequator from a point roughly parallel to the extended southern tip of Tamil Naduduring the Ice Age. Even today the much reduced Maldives are a barrier toshipping, but 16,000 years ago, had anyone been sailing in these parts, theywould have been confronted by an 800 kilometre long line of cliffs running northto south effectively blocking the east-west passage. Hypothetical Ice Ageseafarers wanting to sail east or west would have been more or less obliged tomake their way through one of two deep-water channels – the ‘One and a HalfDegree Channel’ (so named because it slices across the Maldives one and a halfdegrees north of the equator) and the ‘Equatorial Channel7, then as now about 50kilometres wide, which separates South Huvadhoo Atoll (in the northernhemisphere) from Addu Atoll (in the southern hemisphere).So rather than the dots in the ocean that they are today, the Maldives 16,000years ago would have been formidable. If such a thing as ‘Kumari Kandam’ everdid exist, centred as the myths suggest on the antediluvian coastal margins ofsouthern India and Sri Lanka, then might it not also have included the greatbarrier islands of the Maldives just a few hundred kilometres to the south-west?As I noted in chapter 11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11], such ahypothesis would explain the old Tamil traditions which tell us that KumariKandam once extended into the Indian Ocean some ‘700 Kavathams’ (about 1500kilometres) beyond modern Cape Comorin.THE DISAPPEARANCE OF PREHISTORYThe ancient history of the Maldive islands is almost completely unknown3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn3] and their inundation profilesuggests that their prehistory, if any, may have been lost beneath the risingseas at the end of the Ice Age. The matter is further complicated by thepresence of an alarming ‘gravity anomaly’ centred here. In layman’s terms whatthis means is that the archipelago is situated at the bottom of an enormoustrough in the surface of the Indian Ocean itself – this trough being created bya strong local gravitational field which some believe may be linked to the massof sunken mountains on top of which the Maldives atolls have grown. Like othergravity anomalies (several similar troughs have been measured in the world’soceans by satellites) it is not certain that this one has always remained inexactly the same location, or that its depth has always remained the same, orthat it always will do so in the future.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn4]Very little archaeology of any kind has ever been done in the Maldives, but theview of most orthodox scholars is that ‘the first settlers probably arrived fromCeylon not later than AD 500 and were Buddhists’.5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn5] Other authorities argue for anearlier date – back to about 500 BC – and note some south Indian, specificallyTamil, Hindu religious influence.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn6]Thor Heyerdahl, who is one of the few to have conducted archaeologicalexpeditions in the Maldives and whose book The Maldives Mystery is the onlyserious attempt to get to grips with the problems of the islands’ ancienthistory, believes that they were settled much earlier than that – perhaps by2000 BC or even 3000 BC – and that they may have played a part in an archaicIndian Ocean trading network involving ancient Egypt and the Mesopotamian andIndus-Sarasvati civilizations.7 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn7] Sofar Heyerdahl has not been supported by the few carbon-dates obtained from theMaldives – none older than AD 5408 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn8]– but in this as other matters he may yet be proved right. What we do not knowabout these islands far exceeds what we know:Usually the history of a nation begins with a potent king founding a dynasty.The Maldives is a definite exception. A long dynasty of kings was already therebefore known Maldive history started. This kingdom ended when Maldive historybegan. The last king was made a sultan by a pious foreigner who came by sea andstarted local history. He caused all the kings to disappear into oblivion,except one, the one he himself converted. With neither arms, nor with anyMaldive blood in his veins, he introduced a new faith, new laws, and founded thepresent Moslem Maldive state.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn9]In other words, not only has the Maldives suffered the incursions of the sea andthe usual depredations of time but also it was converted, in the year AD 1153(the year 583 of the Holy Prophet), to the Islamic faith,10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn10] which led to further attrition ofancient structures, artefacts and inscriptions. As my old friend Peter Marshall,author of Journey Through the Maldives, explains:Recorded history only begins about the time of the conversion of Maldives toIslam … As Christians in Europe begin their calendar from the birth of Christand tend to dismiss all earlier religions as pagan, so Maldivians follow theIslamic calendar. Until recently they had very little interest in what happenedbefore. Not only was Maldivian pre-Islamic history suppressed but mostpre-Muslim artefacts were destroyed.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn11]So what archaeologists are left to work with in the Maldives, above the water atleast (and nobody has yet looked underwater), is almost certainly just afraction – and perhaps an extremely unrepresentative fraction – of what was oncethere.Even so, buried deep in the jungle of islands up and down the archipelago -someuninhabited and all off-limits to tourists – there are several dozen partiallycollapsed and heavily overgrown pyramids, up to ten metres high, with theirsides oriented to the cardinal directions. Although in a state of ruin today,these mounds of compacted earth and stone, in some cases with stepped courses ofclosely jointed megalithic masonry to be seen exposed under the earth fill, havea sombre and looming presence as they emerge out of the jungle. Called hawittaby the local people, the precise function and origin of these mounds have notbeen confirmed – though the carbon-dates put their construction between roughlyAD 500 and 700.12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn12]Most scholars think they are Buddhist stupas (relic mounds), which probably theyare. Unimpeachably Buddhist sculptures, reliefs on stone and artefacts have beenfound amongst the ruins and some of the pieces are recognizably similar to otherBuddhist work of the same period from India and Sri Lanka -so there is no doubtthat Buddhism was extensively present on these islands in the centuries beforethe coming of Islam.13 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn13] Indeed, aSanskrit text of Vajrayana Buddhism dating back to the ninth or tenth century ADis the earliest surviving legible inscription thus far found in the Maldives.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn14]Still, as a number of observers have noted, there seems to be something strangeabout this Maldivian Buddhism. Could it be some other religious influenceshowing through – maybe a form of Hinduism that had preceded the Buddhist faithto the Maldives? Certain striking sculptures of grotesque human faces withbulging eyes, twirled mustachios and curved cat-like fangs ‘may recall Hindudeities’,15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn15] admits ArneSkjolsvold, an archaeologist with the Kon-Tiki Museum – who nevertheless prefersto explain such images as expressions of a localized subculture of TantricBuddhism.16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn16]There may be clues in Dhivehi, the Maldivian language. It belongs to theIndo-European family and is related to Sanskrit and thus also to Sinhalese, oneof the two languages of Sri Lanka (the other being Tamil). Sinhalese has beenheavily influenced and modified by its contact with Tamil,17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn17] and, according to ClarenceMaloney, a Tamil/Dravidian sublayer exists in Dhivehi also, which suggests that‘Hinduism was present in the Maldives before the Buddhist period.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn18]Interestingly, large numbers of ‘phallic’ sculptures have been recovered inarchaeological excavations in the Maldives – for example amid the ruins of avast temple complex in North Nilandhoo Atoll.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn19] I was able to study a collectionof such objects from different parts of the archipelago and in my opinion,despite some idiosyncrasies, they are nothing more nor less than Sivalinga.That Siva’s characteristic emblem should be found here in these remote islandson the edge of the southern hemisphere is in a way not surprising – since he wasever Daksinamurti, ‘the God of the South’.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn20] But Siva is an ancient and widelyrevered god whom the Vedas associate with the high peaks of the Himalayas far tothe north and whose image as the ascetic Lord of Yoga and as Pasupati, Master ofBeasts, goes back nearly 5000 years in the Indus valley cities of Harappa andMohenjodaro.Moreover, as we saw in chapter 11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11], somany lingam-like objects have been found in much older pre-Harappan sites thatT. R. Sesha Iyenagar can exclaim: ‘the worship of Siva in the form of a lingaexisted in the Stone Age’.21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn21] Inthis regard, therefore, the Kumari Kandam tradition once again proves itself tobe in accord with the archaeological facts when it proclaims Siva’s membershipof the First Sangam, supposedly founded in the antediluvian city of Tenmadurai11,600 years ago – a date deep in the Stone Age.THE RIDDLE OF THE HAWITTASLet’s set to one side for a moment the intimations of vast antiquity for thereligion and religious ideas that became Hinduism and Buddhism (for Buddhism ismerely a ‘protestant’ offshoot of Hinduism and both trace their origins andauthority back to the Vedas).Let’s accept the range of dates around the middle of the first millennium ADproposed by archaeologists for the construction of the pyramidal hawittas of theMaldives (or, strictly speaking, for the construction of the few that have thusfar been excavated).And let’s accept the same date range for the religious sculptures, artefacts,etc. that have been found round about them. There seems no good reason not to doso; on the contrary, it looks as though the archaeologists have done their jobswell and that these dates are likely to be accurate within a reasonable marginof two or three hundred years either way.But then the question arises, where did the distinctive religious art andarchitecture of the Maldives come from? Yes, its sculptures and its pyramids -orstupas – are similar to those of the Buddhists of Sri Lanka, but there aredifferences … And yes, they are similar to those of the Hindus of south India,but again there are differences. So where and when did these differences andunique characteristics incubate and take shape? There is no archaeological traceof any evolution of architectural and symbolic ideas behind the oldeststructures in the Maldives. The hawittas just suddenly appear – we must assumearound 1500 years ago from the carbon-dating – in an already fully designed,fully worked-out form and with all the required building skills already inplace.Were they the work of immigrants importing a pre-existing architectural canonfrom elsewhere? Perhaps – but if so, then where? No other trace of the distinctMaldives style has been found in India or Sri Lanka. Or is it possible that theever-encroaching seas have simply swept away and covered up the earlier stagesof the Maldives story – just as they will sweep away and cover up the littlethat is left of the archipelago before the end of this century?BILL ALLISON’S ANTEDILUVIAN TOURI dived a couple of times in the blue waters of the Maldives with Bill Allison,a tough, crew-cut, steely-eyed, flat-bellied 54-year-old Canadian who isconducting a long-term scientific survey of the islands’ coral reefs. I’vealready noted that our rushed filming schedule and the vast area that would haveto be covered ruled out any structured or useful exploratory diving during ourshort stay – for the same reasons that there is no point in looking for a needlein a haystack. So the producers’ objective for these two dives was simply tofilm what they call ‘pretties’ – beautiful fish, beautiful coral, lush tropicalwaters with infinite visibility, sun effects, surge effects, etc., and genericshots of me finning around in situ. The ‘motive’ for our dives here instorytelling terms (as if anyone needs a motive to dive in the Maldives!) wouldbe provided by Bill Allison – the coral reef expert – showing me – the eagerhistorical detective -notches and caves at various depths that had been cut inthe coral formations by waves during the lowered sea-levels of thousands ofyears ago.After we had completed our dives we sat talking on the deck of the boat in theafternoon sun, moored in the open sea just on the outside edge of North MaleAtoll. I asked Bill: ‘How come the Maldives are here? We see coral under us, butwhat’s the story of how it got there?’Bill: Well, it seems that as India drifted over towards Asia [continental drifthundreds of millions of years ago] the Maldives or what became the Maldives wereleft as a string of volcanoes behind it, and as these volcanoes sank into theearth’s crust, coral grew on them and just kept growing. Right now there’s overmaybe 2000 metres of coral.GH: 2000 metres of coral on top of the original volcanoes?Bill: That’s right.GH: Wow … [pauses for thought) – Now if we … if we go back to the period thatI’m interested in, which is the period from the Last Glacial Maximum, throughuntil about the beginning of historical times, about 5000 years ago or so – sosay from 17,000 years ago down to 5000 years ago – what would we be seeingaround us here, if we could be here 17,000 years ago?Bill: Well, we’d be right now where we are with respect to these islands,looking up about 130 metres to see those trees … Like the cliffs of Dover orsomething. It’d be a plateau with notches cut where the channels are, so thecliffs might be 130 metres high –GH: Wow.Bill: - and the channels –GH: So that would be towering above us?Bill: That’s right. And the channels might be, oh, 80 metres, 90 metres high.GH: Wow. And then once we’re inside that area there (pointing towards atoll)presumably it would all be land?Bill: Yeah.GH: Or would there be some water too?Bill: Well, it’d be depressed and it just depends. This is very porous material.Coral doesn’t grow as a solid mass, just a lot of crevices and so on, so anywater falling would drain rapidly. There might be temporary lakes, there’d bestreams. They would probably develop into underground rivers and they’d probablyempty into the sea through the ground or maybe through the channels.GH: Would there have been rivers above ground?Bill: Rivers? Probably. But probably not big rivers and probably disappearinginto the ground pretty quickly, and we can imagine waterfalls cascading out ofthis plateau we’re looking at, into the sea.GH: So … so the land would be rearing above us. Does that mean we would orwouldn’t be on the sea where we are now?Bill: Well, we might be … we might be on part of the shelf, or on the islandtoo, depending how far out from shore we are. [Looks around and over side ofboat.)GH: But in general, from island to island, what would the situation have been?Would they have been islands?Bill: (figuring out location of boat in relation to reef) Oh, right, OK. We’reon the outside of the atoll now so we’d still be on the sea … We’d be looking atthis big plateau and the islands, what we now think of as sea bottom between theislands, would all be dry – unless it was raining and there were lakes forming –and there’d be vegetative jungle. It’d look a lot like the cockpit country inJamaica in the present time.GH: Right. So it would be –Bill: That’s how I imagine it.GH: So it would be kind of lush, jungly country?Bill: Yeah. On limestone, what’s called karst topography, very rugged, with sinkholes.GH: And then what happens? That’s 17,000 years ago. We’re outside the atoll. Welook inside. We see a huge amount of land – jungle – between what are nowscattered individual islands. Then we know that after the Last Glacial Maximum,sea-level begins to rise. So if you could just talk me through what happensafter that. And I understand it’s a complicated problem, because at the sametime the sea is rising, the volcanoes are very, very slowly sinking and thecoral is growing.Bill: Well, as the sea-level rose, we’d see all that vegetation and landinundated. A lot of the soil would become sediment suspended in the water. Itwould probably inhibit coral growth for a while, so some of the reefs would growand others would not grow, and that probably accounts for some of the variationwe see. We see reefs that are maybe at 50 metres … their tops are at 50 metres,yet now there’s no obvious reason why they didn’t grow, we can only assume thatfor some reason they drowned, whereas other reefs kept up and they’re the oneswe see on the surface today.GH: I know from the studies that we’ve done that there were still substantialamounts of land exposed here down to 10,000, even as late as 8000 years ago.There was more land above water than there is now. Would there be any reason whythese islands should be uninhabited at that time? Would they have been the kindof place where people could have lived?Bill: I would have thought that they’d be relatively easy to find given how farthey were out of the water, and presumably how far west the shelf around Indiamight have extended, so given how much we’re finding out about how our ancestorsused to get around, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if they’d made it here.GH: Because it seems that this sea-level rise – I don’t know if your studiesunderwater have given any indication of this, but what we’ve found out so far isthat the sea-level rise seems not to have been gradual, but to have occurred inepisodes and peaks when there were sudden flooding events and then a plateau andthen another flooding event. Do you see signs of that underwater here?Bill: Well, in fact probably not only was it intermittent, but there were alsodeclines at certain times, and provided that the sea-level stood still for along enough time – and I don’t really know how long that was but probablycenturies to a millennium – then you would get notches cut in the reef slope forexample, and in some places the substantial notches that dissolved in waterbecame grottoes or caves, like those we swam through this afternoon – and someof those collapsed, and you can see these collapsed structures here and there.BILL ALLISON’S TANTALIZING GLIMPSEI had what I thought was a final question for Bill – the obvious one: ‘In allyour years of diving around the Maldives,’ I asked, ‘have you ever seen anythingunderwater that looks man-made – and I don’t mean something modern that’s beendropped down there, but something old?’There was a pause, then he replied rather hesitantly: ‘Well, I did once when Iwas down where I shouldn’t have been, and … I wouldn’t trust what I saw.’GH: How deep were you?Bill: I was about 40 metres doing some work, and it was down below me and I canonly estimate that it might have been at 70 metres, and it looked a lot like astairway.GH: Wow.Bill: But given the distance between it and me, and the fact you can’t resolveanything very clearly at that distance, and because your mind plays a few trickson you at that depth … Well, I wouldn’t want to bet the farm on it.GH: But it looked like a regular cut stairway?Bill: Yeah. And it was narrow, that’s what made me think about it – that itwasn’t an undefined width. It was clearly defined.GH: With sort of side edges?Bill: And had a step-like structure, yeah, as far as I could tell from thatdistance.GH: So what was your feeling when you saw that? Hallucination?Bill: No. I thought, ‘That’s interesting – I’d like to get back and have acloser look some time.’ But I’d prefer to do it on Trimix and with propersurface support.GH: How far is the site from here?Bill: It’s in the Vadhoo Channel – about an hour by boat, but I’m not at allsure that I could find it again.GH: And is it close to islands? I guess everywhere around here is.Bill: Yeah, it’s right on the edge of an atoll rim. So if sea-level was 130metres lower, or anything less down to about 70 metres, then to access the wateror the land, you’d need something like that.GH: You’d need something like a jetty or a wharf, something with steps, yeah.Bill: But I mean I really …GH: You can’t guarantee it?Bill: I’d give it a probability of about 20 per cent or less.Even if Bill had rated the probability of relocating his steps at 2 per cent orless, I think I would still have wanted to go and see if we could find them.But if we could find them – itself probably requiring several days of searching– I would have to do a lengthy, complicated and highly technical course indiving with Trimix (special mixed gases instead of compressed air) before Icould safely descend to work at 70 metres (about 220 feet). So the most we wouldbe able to do – and then only if the visibility was very good – would be tohover at 40 metres and look down at the steps as Bill had done before.However, none of this was an option, because our filming schedule required us tofly to India the next day. Steps or no steps, we were going to have to pack upand leave …THE SECRET OF THE REDINThere are ancient oral traditions, still repeated by the elders of some of themore remote islands, which provide an explanation for the Maldives’ atmosphereof lost prehistoric grandeur and for its strange ruins. These traditions speakof a mysterious people called the Redin, said to have built the hawittas, whowere described to me by Naseema Mohamed, a scholar at the Maldives NationalInstitute for Linguistic and Historical Research, as:Very tall. They were fair-skinned, and they had brown hair, blue eyes sometimes.And they were very, very good at sailing. So this story has been around inMaldives for many, many years, and there are certain places where they say theRedin camped here, and certain places which they say here the Redin were buried.But we don’t really know how old or how long ago it happened.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn22]During his series of research visits to the Maldives, Thor Heyerdahl collectedand compiled Redin legends from all parts of the archipelago. He concludes thatin the memory of the islanders the Redin were ‘a former people with more thanordinary human capacities’:23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn23]The Redin came long before any other Maldivians. Between them and the presentpopulation other people had also come, but none were as potent as the Redin, andthere were many of them. They not only used sail but also oars, and thereforemoved with great speed at sea …24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn24]Likewise, Peter Marshall reports a Maldivian tradition about the phenomenalmaritime abilities of the Redin which tells of how on one occasion they cookedtheir food in the north of the archipelago then sailed so fast to the far souththat they were able to eat the meal there still warm.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn25]Such notions of humans with supernatural or even god-like powers flying swiftlyacross the sea in their boats with sails and oars is strangely reminiscent ofthe imagery of the Rig Veda cited in chapter 7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07] concerning the Asvins – who are severaltimes praised for having conducted a daring rescue in the deeps of the IndianOcean:Yea Asvins, as a dead man leaves his riches, Tugra left Bhujyu in the cloud ofwaters … Ye brought him back in animated vessels … Bhujyu ye bore … to the sea’sfarther shore, the strand of ocean … Ye wrought that hero exploit in the oceanwhich giveth no support, or hold, or station, what time ye carried Bhyjyu to hisdwelling borne in a ship with hundred oars, O Asvins.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn26]O Asvins … Ye made for Tugra’s son [Bhujyu], amid the water floods, thatanimated ship with wings [sails?] to fly withal, whereon … ye brought him forth.And fled with easy flight from out the mighty surge. Four ships, most welcome inthe midst of ocean, urged by the Asvins, saved the son of Tugra, him who wascast down headlong in the waters …27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn27]A CONNECTION WITH THE GULF OF CAMBAY?Any connection with the Vedic Asvins is purely speculative. Nevertheless, ThorHeyerdahl makes a case that there is real history behind the Redin myth, that itis older than the date now confirmed by radiocarbon for the construction of thehawittas - which tradition nevertheless attributes to the Redin – and that thepeople it refers to probably originated in north-west India, the primary settingof the Rig Veda. After visiting Gujerat and the great marine dockyard of theIndus-Sarasvati civilization at Lothal -where cowrie shells from the Maldives(Cyprea Moneta) have been excavated amongst the ruins and are to be seen in thesite museum28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn28] – he comments:[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_070_r1.jpg]Possible prehistoric maritime connection between the Maldives and northernIndia.I was convinced that at least the Hindu element in the Maldives had come fromthe north-western corner of India. And probably the Hindus were not even thefirst to have made the journey straight south from the Gulf of Cambay to theMaldives. Perhaps earlier sailors in the days of Mesopotamian and Indus Valleyseafaring had been led by the sun to the Equatorial Channel, and survived inlegend as the Redin.29 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn29]But if this could be so, then it is also possible that the real people upon whomthe Redin myth is based could have arrived in the Maldives even earlier thanthat. Of particular interest is the fact that the Gulf of Cambay was not a gulfuntil it was suddenly inundated by the last of the three great episodes ofpost-glacial floods some time around 7700 years ago (see chapter 11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11]). Prior to that, the further back yougo in time the further the coast extends to the south of the Gulf, with anotherepisode of tremendous land-loss registered at around 15,000 years ago.MORE THAN ONE LOST CIVILIZATION?Then there is the whole complicated question of the obvious but ancient role ofDravidian and south Indian culture in the prehistory of the Maldives and the wayin which the enlarged Ice Age footprint of the Maldives dovetails with theKumari Kandam myth of the Tamils.On the other hand, there is the obvious Sanskrit and north Indian influence thatis also present in the Maldives and that dominates its language, Dhivehi.It is too easy, in my view, to argue, simply because Dhivehi belongs to theIndo-European language family, that it therefore must be derived from Sinhalese,the Indo-European language of Sri Lanka – which itself only became entrenched inthat island around the sixth century BC following an invasion of settlers fromnorthern India.30 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-ftn30] ThorHeyerdahl’s hypothesis of a prehistoric maritime connection between the Maldivesand Gujerat – and let us not be too hasty to put an upper limit on the antiquityof that connection – is an equally effective means of supplying the Maldiveswith an Indo-European language.Behind all of these questions and problems is the wider issue of therelationship between the Dravidian culture of south India, the traditions andreligious ideas of north India and the distinctive manner in which the Vedic andthe Tamil flood myths intertwine, sharing gods, sharing sages, and sharing thesame underlying story-line built up around the theme of recurrent cataclysms andthe preservation of antediluvian knowledge.Not for the first time I found myself wondering if we could be dealing in Indiawith not one, but two different and yet intimately interrelated lostcivilizations of the Ice Age – one predominant but not exclusive in theantediluvian north-west, with its own individual character, style and language,the other predominant but not exclusive in the antediluvian south, again withits own individual character, style and language.Because of the spectacular land-losses that India had suffered at the end of theIce Age, it was not difficult to imagine how both could have flourished alongthe subcontinent’s coastal margins and outlying island chains at roughly thesame time, both could have been swallowed up by the sea over roughly the sameperiod, and both could have left survivors to repromulgate the antique system ofknowledge that they shared – which claimed, through self-discipline, meditationand the asceticism of yogic austerities, to have marked out the straight andnarrow path of spiritual transcendence in the material world."},{"pageContent":"14 / GHOSTS IN THE WATERThe great deluge took place in 16,000 BC … The second one in 14,058 BC, whenparts of Kumari Kandam went under the Sea. The third one happened in 9564 BC,when a large part of Kumari Kandam was submerged.N. Mahalingam, Chairman, International Association of Tamil StudiesPoompuhur coast, south India, 26 February 2001The ancient religious teachings of India may be directed towards spiritualtranscendence but the morning that we were going out to dive at Poompuhur I feltno inner peace. Instead, I was up brooding long before dawn, my head swirlingwith fears and anxieties, hopes and possibilities. I could feel the first leadennumbness and uneasy visual aura of an oncoming migraine – a perverse afflictionwith which I must deal whenever I am under great stress and am most in need of aclear head. I immediately treated myself with an injection in the thigh of thepowerful drug Immigran, which will normally stop even a severe full-blownmigraine in its tracks, but this time it only reduced and did not entirelyeliminate the symptoms, leaving me feeling weak, drained and on edge.I knew that these were going to be big dives for me, that there was a lot ridingon them, and that the mysterious U-shaped structure that I had come to see wouldbe filmed for the first time so that people everywhere, archaeologists andnon-archaeologists alike, could make up their own minds about it.What this meant was that I was being given the chance – the incredibleopportunity funded by Channel 4’s money and prestige – to test the basicproposition of the Underworld hypothesis, i.e. that evidence which might shedsignificant new light on the mystery of the origins of civilization could belying under the sea. I realized that if Glenn Milne’s inundation dating of‘11,000 years old or older’ for the U-shaped structure was correct, and if theearlier NIO marine archaeologists’ reports that it was man-made rather than somenatural outcrop of rock were also correct, then what was awaiting me on thesea-bed off Poompuhur was, quite possibly, the vindication of my quest.It didn’t matter much what the structure turned out to look like. For example aruined pyramid, or a corbelled archway, or broken columns – though archetypalantediluvian images in popular culture – were not in the least required.Irrespective of how dilapidated it might be, irrespective of how covered inmarine growth and sediment it might be, even should it prove dull andunexceptional to the eye, all that I needed to prove my case were the remains ofa structure that was monumental in scope, man-made and more than 11,000 yearsold, sitting on the sea-bed off the south-east coast of Tamil Nadu.If the U-shaped structure was all these things, then it could not be explainedby the orthodox model of history. And if it was all of these things, then thehitherto discredited Tamil myths of a great antediluvian civilization calledKumari Kandam that had once existed around the southern coasts and islands ofIndia might very well be true. So in a way, I reflected, if the U-shapedstructure really was what the NIO said it was, then I was about to come face toface with my own personal Holy Grail.How very annoying, therefore, that my film producers had scheduled just one dayfor the diving. Having gone to great lengths to get the NIO to cooperate with usover filming the U-shaped structure at Poompuhur, and having paid out a verylarge sum of money to hire the NIO diving team and marine archaeologistsfull-time for six days, here we were making use of them for just one day!It struck me as a crazy, misguided, self-contradictory policy which on the onehand had moved heaven and earth to make it possible for me to dive at Poompuhurat all and on the other would only allow me two or at the most three dives atthe site – thus making it almost inevitable that I would not be able to do aproper job there. I felt like Moses being told that he could see the PromisedLand but would not be allowed to enter.No wonder I had a headache.THAT GENTLEMAN IS NOT WELL …The coastal plains around Poompuhur are exceptionally flat with a gentle seawardslope – a characteristic of topography that continues unbroken underwater for avery great distance out from shore and that would have multiplied the effects ofeven relatively small sea-level rises into rapid and catastrophic floods capableof inundating very large areas.We met up with our NIO friends on the beach – Kamlesh Vora, Gaur, Sundaresh,Gudigar, Bandodkar and others – and a scene was shot of me greeting them andwalking with them. The scene required three takes.Then we all piled into a small open launch to make the run through the bigbreakers that were lashing the shallows to the point about a kilometre off-shorewhere the fishing trawler that the NIO had chartered for the diving was moored.Another hour or so passed while we did the launch-to-trawler run twice more sothat it could be shot from different angles.Then finally we all climbed on board the trawler – not so easy since its sidestowered more than 2 metres above the bottom of the launch – stowed ourequipment, and headed out into the open sea.I was irritable, withdrawn – certainly not very conversational – and felt likelying on my back and closing my eyes to ease the ominous symptoms of myreturning migraine. Instead, for the next half hour as we chugged the remaining4 kilometres towards the dive site, basic good manners required that I stay onmy feet, catch up on gossip with everyone from the NIO, and look cheerful,optimistic and positive. After all, I was a man being given an incredibleopportunity. Shouldn’t that put a smile on my long Scottish face?[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_071_r1.jpg]Position of the submerged U-shaped structure off Poompuhur coast. Based on Raoet al.Sundaresh and Bandodkar had already buoyed the site some days previously andwhile the trawler manoeuvred into position to anchor next to the buoy I wanderedoff to an unoccupied corner of the deck and surreptitiously gave myself anothershot of Immigran. That made two, the maximum permitted dosage in twenty-fourhours. Praying that this horrible, increasingly blinding and ghastly headachewould now please go away, I lay down with a towel over my eyes for the next tenminutes, only sitting up again when it was clear that the anchoring operationhad been completed.‘Feeling any better?’ asked Kamlesh with genuine concern.‘Not sure,’ I replied.‘That gentleman also is not well.’I looked over to where Martin, our underwater cameraman, was indeed verydefinitely unwell, sprawled on the deck retching miserably …It seemed unlikely that he would be going underwater any time soon.CORNUCOPIAIn the end it was decided that Stefan Wickham, the producer, would film thefirst dive. Hopefully, Martin would be well enough to shoot the second for us.There probably wouldn’t be time for a third, because we still had to interviewGaur, Sundaresh and Kamlesh on the boat and had already used up most of themorning shooting the scenes from the beach and just getting to the dive site.As I was rigging my tank I noticed that half a dozen small local fishing crafthad arrived here ahead of us and that the fishermen, oblivious to our presencein their midst, were cheerfully casting out their lines and hauling them inagain with big silver fish attached. It seemed that here, as elsewhere along theCoromandel coast, the location of underwater ruins was part of the essentialsurvival knowledge and folklore of fishing communities – just as they knew thetides and the monsoons – because an underwater ruin meant one thing for sure andthat was a cornucopia of fish …Stefan jumped in the water first – intending to have the camera rolling before Ijumped in. Instead, he was carried off in a brisk surface current and beganrapidly to recede from view. Fortunately, the trawler had a motorized rubberdinghy in tow which was dispatched to retrieve him and fifteen minutes later hewas back on board. The trick, explained the NIO divers, was not to try to fightthe current but to grab hold of the buoy-line the minute you hit the water andthen use it to pull yourself down the 23 metres to the ruin.DIVE 1: DESCENTAlthough the sky is now overcast the water isn’t cold, not like Dwarka the yearbefore. But compared to the life-giving iridescent blues of the Maldives, itssickly and unnatural green hue, through which light penetrates only dimly afterthe first few metres of the descent, has all the allure of radioactive fog aftera nuclear disaster. Like blighted snowflakes, a blizzard of grey particles blowsthrough the water on the current and I soon lose sight of the other divers onthe line. I know that Sundaresh, my dive buddy today, is just a few metres belowme, but I can’t see him. In conditions like this there is really nothing much tobe done except check your gauges, relax, trust in your own competence and headfor the bottom.Five metres deeper and the visibility suddenly begins to clear – notdramatically, but still much better than before. The current seems to haveslackened too, as sometimes happens at greater depth. Visibility continues toimprove and at one point looking down the line I can see all three of the NIO’sdivers spaced out at metre intervals below me, their yellow and blue tanksbright through the haze.At about 18 metres I begin to get the first sense of something large standingout from the flat and sandy bottom. At this moment it’s just a looming mass ofdarkness contrasted to lighter surroundings and my eyes can’t resolve it into adefinite shape.The other divers above and below me leave the line, fan out and disappear fromview. Gaur is working with Santha, who will be shooting stills. Gudigar isworking with Stef on the video camera. Gaur, Gudigar and Sundaresh were all partof the team of marine archaeologists who first dived on the structure during theNIO’s initial surveys in 1991 and 1993.SLEEPING WITH THE FISHESSundaresh, who is waiting for me at the bottom, wants to show me courses ofmasonry that he has noticed on his previous dives – but before I join him forthe guided tour I let go of the line, establish neutral buoyancy and just driftabout 2 metres above and 2 metres to the side of the structure. There’s nocurrent now at all, the visibility has gone very foggy again – probably sedimentkicked up by some of the other divers – and I rest completely still inmid-water, adjusting my eyes to the gloom, trying to understand what I’m lookingat.The only thing I can tell immediately is that it’s a big, squat,powerful-looking structure. In order to get any useful idea of its shape, extentand general situation, and even to form a first opinion of whether it might beman-made or natural, I need to be quite a bit further away from it than 2metres. But if I do that, in these conditions, it rapidly fades from view,becoming just a vague, undefined darkness on the sea-bed again, and thendisappearing entirely into the fog.I swim around a bit, now closer, now further away, trying to get perspective,looking for an angle. And then unexpectedly the whole scene in front of mebrightens – the sun must have broken through the clouds – and for thirty secondsI am confronted by a massive wall of deeply eroded and pitted stone. Althoughmuch broken and ruined, and incorporating a number of jagged verticalprotrusions and step-like changes in level, I can see that the wall in generalrises about 2 metres above the sea-bed to form the outside edge of an extensiveplatform.It comes home to me, in this moment of illumination, that the structure has itsown character – as many buildings do. It seems menacing but also forlorn, eeriebut also sad. For as well as thick growths of unusually leprous marine organismsall over it, the shaft of sunlight shows it to be draped and tangled across itsentire length in a strangling web of fishermen’s nets – some made of old rope,ancient and rotting away, others in the sinister colours of indestructiblemodern synthetics – which seem to tie it down like the body of a Mafia victimsleeping with the fishes.I find myself suppressing an involuntary shiver, as though reacting to anapparition, or a ghost, and swim back to find Sundaresh still patiently waitingfor me at the bottom of the line.WALLS … PASSAGES … ENTRANCESWe begin by swimming slowly south along the upper outside edge of the platformwall – if indeed it is a platform, which I’m now beginning to doubt. Rather thanflat as I’d initially assumed, its surface at this point seems to be slightlyconcave – or dish-like – and to be paved with a mosaic of small stones. I findmyself wondering if it’s possible that I’m looking at the retaining wall of anenclosure – I know its supposed to be U-shaped – filled up almost to the rimwith some kind of sandy, stony aggregate.The wall at this point is aligned north-south but soon begins to bend to theeast to form the base of the ‘U’. In another one of those little flashes ofillumination as the sun breaks through the clouds I can see that we must havestarted our swim at the open end of the ‘U’ – the end spoken of in some of theNIO reports as ‘the entrance’ – and that the length of the structure along thisaxis is therefore roughly the distance we have just travelled, about 30 metres.Not far before the bend begins I pass an opening to my left which I pause toinvestigate. It is a deep, narrow cleft with parallel sides a little wider thanmy shoulders slicing vertically through the whole height of the outer wall topenetrate the platform (or the stony fill, or whatever it is) that lies beyond.And for the first few metres at least, this gully, or unroofed passage (orwhatever it is!) follows a curving path that seems to duplicate, from within thestructure, the distinctive outer curve of the ‘U’. Swathed everywhere withsnagged and rotting nets, it is rough and broken in places, flat-floored andclean-edged with an almost quarried look in others.Making a mental note to spend more time here before the end of the dive I turnback and resume my original course along the outside wall where it bends to theeast, trying to catch up with Sundaresh. Looking for me, he meanwhile has swumall the way round and made his way back to the entrance where I eventually joinhim.But is it really an entrance?As though understanding my perplexity, Sundaresh points to a gap in the wallabout a metre and a half wide to one side of which I can now see that thebuoy-line is tied. Holding his hands up he reassuringly signals ‘this is theentrance’.I take a closer look.What’s confusing things once again is the stony aggregate that fills most of thestructure – although I’ve noticed that it does so quite unevenly. Its presencehere makes it hard to see the gap as an entrance because it doesn’t seem to leadanywhere much. At the same time the thick retaining wall, generally in the rangeof 2 metres high, is at least a metre higher than that on either side of the gap– resembling a pair of gateposts. It also has a pronounced lip standing proud ofthe aggregate infill by almost half a metre – weighting the scales ever more infavour of the idea that the U-shaped structure must originally have beendesigned not as a platform but an enclosure, and that it certainly cannot be anatural formation.But is the enclosure wall hewn out of living rock, like the great carved shoretemples of Mahabalipuram, or is it a built structure made of bricks or stoneblocks?We use up the rest of the first dive searching for the courses of masonry thatSundaresh is convinced he saw in 1993. Yet how are we to find them under thethick and tenacious armour of marine organisms that coats the wall? Severaltimes reaching into shadowy eroded hollows to see what’s inside we must work ourhands carefully around resident scorpion fish which flutter their poisonousspines as though to taunt: ‘Go on, touch me – make my day.’But we don’t find any evidence of masonry.Not on the first dive.DISTURBINGDuring the surface interval I fought down waves of nausea and the pounding in mytemples, took another shot of Immigran, and felt sufficiently restored afterhalf an hour to fall into an argument with Gaur about the U-shaped structure.The reader will recall from chapter 9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09]that Gaur’s position had been rather stark when he and I had first discussed thematter a year before: the structure was large; its depth meant that it was morethan 10,000 years old; archaeology knew of no culture anywhere in India capableof building such a structure 10,000 years ago; therefore either the structurewas not man-made or it was not 10,000 years old.I asked him if he’d changed his mind in any way over the intervening year andtold him of the findings of Glenn Milne and his team at Durham: ‘We’ve had somegeologists working with us on this project in Britain who are specializing insea-level rise. And their computer model is quite sophisticated. It takesaccount of many, many different factors, including land subsidence. And they’revery confident that for these bearings, for this location, that this site wouldhave been submerged about eleven thousand years ago. What do you make of that?’If anything, Gaur replied, this made his chronological problems with the dataeven worse: ‘11,000 years ago whatever settlements there may have been here wereat the Mesolithic level. And we don’t expect, we don’t have any data to suggest,that such people, Mesolithic people, can build this kind of structure.’‘Such a large structure as this?’ I prompted.‘Yes.’‘And you’re saying that – presumably – on the basis of what you already knowabout the level of culture and civilization in this area in different periods?’‘Yes,’ said Gaur: ‘So I think – if it is man-made – it should be around 2500years old, maximum date. Not earlier than that, particularly in this area.’‘And I think you’re putting the cart before the horse,’ I interjected. ‘See,obviously I’m not an archaeologist and I come at this really from the point ofview of a reporter or a journalist. So my response to this structure is first ofall the facts. A structure is there. It’s at 23 metres. Is it or is it notman-made? I feel the structure has to answer that question itself instead of ussimply replacing what it has to say with our preconceptions about the nature ofdevelopment of culture in India at this or that period. The structure shouldspeak to us through archaeology. We should excavate it and find out really is itman-made or not. Although I must say that I personally find it very difficult tobelieve that nature could have deposited a structure like that there. So thequestion I’m coming to is this. We know that certainly 9000 years ago peoplewere beginning to build quite large structures in some parts of India – forexample level 1A at Mehrgarh in the Indus valley. Now, admittedly that’s 2000years later than the proposed inundation date for this structure but it’s in thesame general ballpark – back at the end of the Ice Age. So my point is that ifpeople were building permanent structures at Mehrgarh in the north-west 9000years ago, then what is the objection in principle to the possibility thatpeople could have been building permanent structures here in the south-east11,000 years ago on lands that were flooded?’‘Well, because we don’t see any such structures in the archaeological record forsouth India or any part of India 11,000 years ago!’‘But maybe that’s precisely what we’re seeing here, Gaur! We haven’t seen itbefore because it’s been underwater, but now that it’s been found surely we haveto allow it to speak for itself? It seems to me that the archaeology needs to bedone on the site first before we make any definite statements about the level ofculture that was here 11,000 years ago.’‘From what I have studied and from what I understand about Mehrgarh,’ Gaurreplied, ‘if you go back to level 1A it was simply mud walls and they wereconcentrated in one area – they were living in a group and the village communitystarted. But when we come to Poompuhur – well, if you see the U-shapedstructure, it is such a big one. And it is part of a complex with other bigstructures spread over a wide area. So it means if human beings made this thenthey must have had very great technology at that time. I don’t think it can becompared with the simple mud-brick structures of Mehrgarh …’‘In other words, if the U-shaped structure is 11,000 years old and was made byhuman beings it would be rather disturbing for our view of history.’‘Yes. Obviously.’DIVE 2: IMPATIENCE AND HASTEMartin takes over from Stefan on the camera for the second dive but Stefan comesdown as well, just in case.We all descend the buoy-line and are back at the entrance – which is orientednorth. I swim south as before, heading for the curving passageway near the farend of the ‘U’ that I’d noted on the first dive and forgotten to re-examine.Sundaresh is a metre or two behind me, still looking for his courses of masonryand I’m steaming ahead when I feel him reach out and grab my fin. He points tosomething that he clearly regards as noteworthy, but whether it’s because I amdisoriented diving on an unfamiliar structure, or whether it’s because of theappalling visibility, or because I’m in too much of a hurry, or because of mymigraine, I just don’t see what he’s showing me.Behind us Martin doesn’t either – but he keeps shooting, recording the relevantincident in twenty-six seconds of videotape that I’m not able to review untillate that evening. The first twenty-four seconds show me being impatient andhasty. The last two seconds show something that I should under no circumstanceshave allowed myself to miss through impatience and haste – something that Ishould have examined thoroughly on the spot and had filmed and photographed fromevery different angle.Instant replay26 February 2001, 15.37.02–15.37.28:Hancock and Sundaresh swimming north-to-south, along western wall of U-shapedstructure, Hancock in lead, depth approximately 22 metres. Sundaresh pauses toexamine area of wall, attracts Hancock’s attention, then returns to wall.Hancock joins Sundaresh, who points to area of interest on wall.Hancock gives it cursory glance and seems keen to get a move on.Camera tilts down to base of the wall, just above the surrounding sea-bed, thenbegins to tilt up for point-of-view shot.Shot holds for two seconds on a narrow section of the wall about 1 metre highthat is clear of growth and reveals in lower right of frame an ordered patternof small blocks arranged in four distinct courses with the edge of a possiblefifth course partially visible under marine growth. The blocks are brick-sizedbut irregular in cross-section and appear to be set into some kind of matrix.Camera tilts up to top of wall, rediscovers Hancock who is swimming determinedlyaway, and follows …EXCURSION TO THE MOUNDAt this point – frustratingly still before I have reached the curving passagewaythat branches inside the structure at the southern end of the ‘U’ – the otherdivers signal us back, wanting to stick to the plan that we had all agreed inadvance for this dive and that I had forgotten as soon as I hit the water. Theplan is to spend most of our fairly limited bottom-time at this depth exploringa second major structure that lies close by (about 45 metres away according toSundaresh when we had discussed the matter in Dwarka the year before).1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c14-ftn1] One of a pair of ‘mounds’ lying tothe north of the U-shaped structure, it was identified during the NIO’s 1991 and1993 seasons at Poompuhur, and Sundaresh had spoken of seeing ‘perfect cutblocks’ scattered on the sea-bed beside it.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c14-ftn2]Bandodkar, whose word is law amongst the NIO divers, has insisted that thissecond dive should be limited on decompression grounds to half an hour or less –a prudent but in my view unnecessarily zealous interpretation of the nitrogentables for the depth we are working at. I suppose it was because I was feelingrebellious about this time-limit on the whole dive that I rushed off so fast atthe beginning to attend to my interest in the curved passageway.Now I am rightly brought to order so that we can all proceed as a group to thesecond structure. I can see the point of being safety-minded in theseconditions. The visibility is extremely bad – almost like being lost in animmense sandstorm but with a different texture. And although the NIO divers havepreviously rigged a yellow nylon rope as a guideline I still feel disoriented asI follow it. North? South? East? West? Up? Down?Down is easy. In fact I’m so close to the sea-bed that I’m practicallyslithering on it and yet it gives me no points of reference because it consistsof absolutely and uniformly smooth, flat and unbroken fine-grained sand. Thecontrast with the stony textures and the bulky solidity and complexity of theU-shaped structure could not be more pronounced.Then we reach the ‘mound’. Like the U-shaped structure it has an isolatedposition in the middle of the flat plain with no slope or build-up. A lot ofsilt and sand has been deposited on it and around it, but there’s no doubt thatits core is a massive stony pile. I can make out what seems to be the edge of awall a metre thick and similar in general appearance to the enclosure wallsaround the U-shaped structure. Festooned in scorpion fish it rises to a heightof about 3 metres above the sea-bed before disappearing into the larger mass ofthe mound behind it.Martin shoots this scene but then signals that he is unwell and must return tothe boat. Sticking to Bandodkar’s safety rules the entire group leaves the moundand makes the trek back along the rope with him until we come again to theentrance of the U-shaped structure where the buoy-line is anchored. Martin andsome of the other divers then ascend. Stef, who has the camera again, followsme.BLOCKS IN THE PASSAGEWAYI’m still determined to explore that curving passageway, so I swim south asusual along the west wall. Sundaresh and Stef both keep pace.I can see the narrow entrance to the passage coming up on my left when I noticesomething on the bottom to my right less than 2 metres west of the base of thewall. It looks like a small splintered tree stump protruding upwards out of thesand. But it proves to be made of badly damaged and eroded stone. Two moresimilar objects are near by but none of them in itself seems particularlyinteresting. Feeling pressured for time, I do not examine them further.Next I’m into the passageway. Been there. Done that. I want to see where itleads to.So I follow it all the way through this time and find myself in something like aroom, very roughly defined, that seems to be free of the otherwise all-pervasivestony aggregate that so confuses the picture elsewhere on the structure.Platform? Or enclosure? It would be a funny sort of platform that had anopen-roofed room carved out in the middle of it – maybe more than one room forall I know.For my money, therefore, this is yet another good reason to conclude that theU-shaped structure is an enclosure, that it probably has several internal wallsthat are presently hidden from view, that it has its main entrance to the northand at least one subsidiary entrance in the west wall, and that either throughhuman or natural agency it has at some point been partially filled up with stonyrubble.Ah, the freedom and manoeuvrability of diving. On a whim I adjust my buoyancy bybreathing in and ascend out of the ‘room’ to a point a few metres above thestructure hoping to get a plan view – but once again the awful visibilitydefeats me and I can see almost nothing.I drop back down and work with Stef to complete a little sequence of me lookingaround the ‘room’ then swim out of shot while he finishes filming inside. Amoment or two later I see him emerge backwards from the curving passage, stillfilming, with the camera seeming to focus mainly on the floor and the lower partof the side walls.On that footage too I will later note something else of interest that I missedin the rush and stress of the day. It’s on just eight seconds of tape.Instant replay26 February 2001, 15.56.33–15.56.42Shot tracks unsteadily along floor of passage and passes across net draped overand partially obscuring change of level and possible step up in floor.Camera ascends about a metre, shot tracks left of net and picks up a clear lineof five blocks emerging from under marine growth. They are dark, almost charcoalblack, and brick-sized like those seen on the first dive, but here much moreregular in cross-section.Shot wavers, returns to net, then tracks left again passing the same line ofblocks which is now seen to continue to the left by at least a further sixblocks, with other courses in outline above and below it, before it disappearsunder the heavy marine growth again.ASCENTOn the way up we do the routine five-minute stop at 5 metres to reduce ournitrogen levels. The water is very still and warm, the visibility worse thanever, and I drift in neutral buoyancy slowing my breathing, just thinking thingsthrough.It feels strange to have been privileged to see a structure hidden from humaneyes for 11,000 years.A structure more than 7000 years older than the Great Pyramid of Egypt.A structure for which no archaeological context exists.A ruined net-draped structure.A ghost in the water …MORE BLOCKS ON TAPEThis was turning out to be a good day for Glaxo Wellcome. After the second diveI took my fourth injection of Immigran at $50 a shot. Then I had to collapseagain, sprawled out like a landed fish on the wooden deck of the trawler whilethe pain in my head gradually dulled and withdrew – only people who suffer fromsevere migraines will understand the sense of relief and release that I felt asthe drug did its work.By 5.30 I was back on my feet drinking tea and chatting to Kamlesh Vora. Ataround the same time Martin went down for a short dive in the last of thedaylight accompanied only by Gudigar in the hope of getting relatively clean,undisturbed shots of the structure.When I later came to review these shots I found that they contained a thirdbrief sequence showing construction blocks, this time of better quality than theprevious two. The sequence is timecoded 17.36.15–17.36.29 and Martin seems to bestanding on the sea-bed near the enclosure wall:The shot starts focused on a small white shell lying on the sand then quiteslowly pans across to the base of the wall and holds steady for several secondson four distinct courses of masonry. Again the size of modern household bricks,perhaps a little larger, the blocks here are extremely regular and almostcylindrical – or cigar-shaped. The exposed sections of each course can be seento continue horizontally over a width of approximately a dozen blocks until theyeither vanish out of shot or disappear beneath thicker marine growth.MYSTERIOUSBy profession Kamlesh Vora is a geologist, not a marine archaeologist, butgeology plays an increasingly important role in modern marine archaeologicalresearch and is one of several important skills necessary to distinguish whethera disputed structure is natural or man-made. Moreover, Kamlesh had been involvedin the very first work that the NIO had ever done at Poompuhur way back in 1981– long years before the 1991 and 1993 campaigns – and had carried out theinitial sonar surveys on which much of the later work plan was based.I kicked off our interview on the boat with a leading question: ‘The ocean is abig place and we see that there are some possible structures here. Have you doneany kind of surveying from the surface?’Kamlesh replied: ‘In 1981, when we started marine archaeological explorations inTamil Nadu, we began with Poompuhur. And we scanned the sea-bed usingechosounder and magnetometer. What we found interesting was that otherwise thesea-bed was flat, even and smooth as far as the echosounder was concerned. Butthere were a number of anomalous features scattered in the area – some a bitoblong in structure, some like pinnacles – and the echosounder showed theelevation of these features to be in the range of 2 to 5 metres above thebottom. Such outcrops and elevations are not at all to be expected from localgeology and we could not comprehend how they had been formed. If they are to benatural extensions of bedrock, then we should see different topography. Forexample, off the west coast of India we have found pinnacles or things like thisbecause of a number of reasons, and we have collected samples and then done ourinvestigations.’‘And on the west coast they’re a natural extension of the rock?’‘There are basaltic rocks,’ Kamlesh clarified, ‘which may have extensions. Andwe have found man-made structures underwater in the north-west like Dwarkawhich, as you know, have come in the last 5000 years …’‘But the story is different here on the east coast?’‘This is totally different because we could not give any logical explanation forthem. So even during those times we considered them as anomalous.’‘So, looking at them as a geologist, as you are, you find it surprising thatthese features are sticking up if they’re purely natural?’‘Yes,’ Kamlesh replied with a shrug. ‘Only thing during that time is we didn’thave support of diving team. So we could not collect samples and do analysis ofthe rocks. Even now when we collect it, we could not get the proper rocks fordifferent kinds of test, so we don’t have samples enough to go to some logicaltheory on that.’‘This U-shaped structure that we’ve just been diving on,’ I asked, ‘was itidentified in that survey?’‘Yes. And totally up to twenty structures were identified round about.’‘But you’ve not had a chance to dive on the other ones?’‘No,’ said Kamlesh, ‘we didn’t get the opportunity to come back and work likethis. So maybe in future we shall come and concentrate on them. Then also weshould seek information and try side-scan sonar surveys and diving to see ifthere are other structures in other areas along the coast. Because this oneplace may be in isolation. But if there are three or four other major groups ofstructures in other locations …’He looked out to sea and stopped speaking without completing his sentence.‘It feels to me like a very exciting area,’ I offered after a moment, ‘with somany, as you say, anomalous structures And they are anomalous. We don’t knowwhat they are. But it seems to me an area that deserves more attention.’‘Mysterious,’ Kamlesh replied after a moment more.THE MOUND AT 27 METRESWhen we were parting company with our NIO friends well after nightfall on thedarkened beach, Gaur took me aside to tell me that he had remembered a dive doneduring 1993 at Poompuhur that might be of interest to me. The dive had been afirst exploration, never subsequently followed up, to check out one of theanomalous mounds in 27 metres of water – 4 metres deeper than the U-shapedstructure. Gaur had not dived on this deeper structure himself but had been toldabout it by colleagues who had: ‘It was a heap,’ he said, ‘of things … It’squite high. I mean 2 metres high.’‘Is it in the same general area as the U-shaped structure?’ I asked.‘No,’ Gaur replied. ‘It’s further out. A 4 metre difference in depth here meansyou have to go out at least another 500 to 600 metres.’‘All the more obvious, then, that there’s a need for a really extensive surveyand much more marine archaeology here …’‘I agree,’ said Gaur, ‘even if only to prove that these things are notman-made.’SECRETS OF THE REINAL MAPFEBRUARY/MARCH 2001Readers will recall that three days before our dives at Poompuhur I had receivedan e-mail from my researcher Sharif Sakr concerning an intriguing Portuguese map– the Reinal map of the Indian Ocean, dated 1510. But not until I was back inEngland at the beginning of March did I have the time to consider in detail whatSharif had to say about it or compare his attached scan of the Reinal map andother maps that he mentioned with Glenn Milne’s sequence of inundation mapscovering the end of the last Ice Age.Sharif Sakr to Graham Hancock23 February 2001Hi Graham,I’ve noticed an interesting correlation between the Jorge Reinal map of 1510(see attached scan from facsimile in Hapgood, fig. 77) and Glenn Milne’sinundation maps of India. It is perhaps not immediately obvious, so please letme know what you think. (There is a good facsimile of the Reinal 1510 in vol. 1of the Portugaliae Monumenta Cartographica in the Bodleian Library, Oxford andI’ve ordered a reproduction. Until it arrives we must rely on the tracing inHapgood, which lacks detail but is basically accurate.)I was first attracted to the Reinal by its remarkable accuracy, and its obviousrelationship to the Cantino 1502, and also the Ptolemaeus Argentinae 1513. Whilethe map is not as accurate as the Cantino in terms of the ratio of India’s longand lat extensions, it is nevertheless an amazing development relative to theolder Ptolemaic model, especially considering that Portuguese naval explorationof India only began after 1498. E. Kemp (Asia in Maps) suggested that Cantino’sdepiction of India came not from Portuguese observation but from contacts withthe traders of Calicut – perhaps Reinal’s map of India was based on the samesources (and perhaps these sources were the Indian Ocean nautical chartsmentioned by Polo?).Despite the map’s general accuracy, there are a number of glaring mistakes.Firstly, at the precise latitude of the mouth of the Indus there is a large gulfrather than the delta which exists today. Secondly, moving south along the map,Reinal makes the same mistake as the author of the Cantino, and fails to showthe important Kathiawar peninsula or the gulfs (Kutch and Cambay) that flank it.Instead, Reinal has given this north-west corner of India a distinct bulge, suchthat it appears ‘fatter’ than it should. Thirdly, Reinal has apparently ignoredthe proper portolan convention of depicting very tiny islands (too small to bedrawn to scale) as crosses (or some other diagrammatic symbol) and has insteaddrawn the Lakshadweep and Maldives as rather large islands – far larger thanthey really are. Lastly, Reinal has failed to give the southern tip of India itsproper south-easterly orientation. Instead, he has given it a south-westerlyorientation, and distinct ‘lips’ which make it look like an open mouth, ready tobite off the top of the Maldives.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_072_r1.jpg]Outline of India’s coastlines in Jorge Reinal’s map of AD 1510, based on tracingby Charles Hapgood (1966).[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_073_r1.jpg]Outline of India’s western coastline as it was 21,300 years ago.While these deviations are all errors relative to a modern map of India, they infact match up extremely well with Glenn Milne’s map of India 21,300 years ago atLGM. This inundation map shows a large indent at the mouth of the Indus, a bulgeobscuring completely the Kathiawar peninsula, enlarged Lakshadweep and Maldiveislands, and, most surprisingly, a SW-pointing ‘mouth’ shape at India’s southerntip that is virtually identical to that shown by Reinal. (Note that the ‘errors’match up even better with a basic bathymetric map of India that shows the verydistinct outer shelf, which I use as a kind of benchmark for the basic shape ofIndia’s coastline around LGM.) As you travel in time through the sequence thecorrelation is still good 16,400 years ago but is gone by 13,500 years ago whena large island appears south of the Kathiawar peninsula.The correlation is not perfect – the inundation maps show a clear land-bridgebetween India and Sri Lanka, whereas Reinal has not drawn a land-bridge. BeingPortuguese and living during the exciting time of the Portuguese discovery ofIndia, Reinal would have been a laughing stock if he’d failed to depict theisland of Ceylon. Curiously, however, Reinal has drawn dots in the shape of theland-bridge across the Palk Strait, giving the impression that Ceylon is tooclose to the mainland. Perhaps Reinal was indicating dangerous shallows. But aglance at my bathymetry data suggests there are no such shallows – most of theStrait is over 6 m in depth. Alternatively, Reinal may have wished to indicatetiny islands, but even this would have been inaccurate, as the real distributionof islands in the Palk Strait today is nothing like the shape of Reinal’s dotsor of the land-bridge that would have existed at LGM. So I wonder why Reinaldrew these dots between India and Sri Lanka – was he perhaps trying to reconcilecommon knowledge of Ceylon as an island with other sources that depicted aland-bridge?A final point of interest is that as the years went on, after 1510, Reinal beganto correct all the mistakes described above (for example he added the Gulfs ofKutch and Cambay). But as he made these corrections, the basic outline of Indiaactually worsened rather than improved. To me, this suggests that the earlier1510 map was based on the same unknown sources as the Cantino (very accurate interms of long and lat, but with some strange features), whereas the later mapswere based on contemporary Portuguese observational mapmaking and all itsinherent weaknesses. Regards, SharifAlthough Hapgood had reproduced the Reinal map, he had analysed it only from theperspective of its mathematics and inclusion of anachronistic geographicalknowledge (e.g., of Australia, not discovered at that time).3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c14-ftn3] He had not considered thepossibility of a correlation between the way in which it portrayed India and theactual appearance of the Indian coastline during the Ice Age. On the contrary,he concluded:It seemed evident to me that this map showed much more geographical knowledgethan was available to the Portuguese in the first decade of the sixteenthcentury, and a better knowledge of longitudes than could be expected of them.The drawing of the coasts, however, left much to be desired. The map looked muchlike a map, once magnificently accurate, that had been copied and recopied bynavigators ignorant of the methods of accurate mapmaking.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts_r1.htm#c14-ftn4]So Sharif’s approach to the Reinal map did not duplicate Hapgood – somethingthat I was determined to avoid – but looked at its depiction of India in thelight of the new science of inundation mapping that had already provided us withan extremely effective and revealing research tool.I agreed with Sharif that in the light of that science Reinal had in fact drawna weirdly accurate map of the south-west, west and north-west coasts of theIndian subcontinent between roughly 21,000 and perhaps 15,000 years ago. It wasalso potentially the strongest lead that I had seen for a long while on theextraordinary possibility that accurate maps could have been made of the worldduring the Ice Age and that some copies of these maps could have survived andgot into circulation again – always in use and subject to constant modification– during the European Age of Discovery.Maps of the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean.Maps of the Pacific and the Far East.Maps of the North.Maps of Africa.Maps of the Americas and the Atlantic – perhaps including the map, never found,that Columbus is rumoured to have used to guide his journey to the New World in1492.Even maps of Atlantis …I decided to investigate further.CAMBAY: ANOTHER GHOST RISING FROM THE DEEP?MAY 2001Our final filming trip to India, which would focus on Dwarka, and inlandHarappan sites such as Dholavira in Gujerat, was scheduled for November 2001,still many months away.Then in May, although hardly reported at all by the international media, thefollowing story made headline news in the Indian press:The Times of IndiaSaturday 19 May 2001HARAPPAN-LIKE RUINS DISCOVERED IN GULF OF CAMBAYIn a major marine archaeological discovery, Indian scientists have come up withexcellent geometric objects below the sea-bed in the western coast similar toHarappan-like ruins.‘This is the first time such sites have been reported in the Gulf of Cambay,’Science and Technology Minister Murli Manohar Joshi told reporters.The discovery was made a few weeks ago when multi-disciplinary underwatersurveys carried out by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) pickedup images of ‘excellent geometrical objects’, which were normally man-made, in a9-kilometre stretch west of Hazira in Gujerat.‘It is important to note that the underwater marine structures discovered inGulf of Cambay have similarity with the structures found on land onarchaeological sites of Harappan and pre-Harappan times,’ Joshi said.The acoustic [sonar] images showed the area lined with well-laid housebasements, like features partially covered by sand waves and sand ripples at30–40 metre water depth.At many places channel-like features were also seen indicating the possibleexistence of possible drainage in the area, he said.Possible age of the finds can be anywhere between 4000 and 6000 years, Joshisaid, adding the site might have got submerged due to a powerful earthquake.This guess seems perfectly reasonable in line with the orthodox chronology ofIndian history and prehistory. But it is also perfectly wrong.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_074_r1.jpg]Cross marks position of Cambay underwater site discovered by NIOT.What Joshi could not have known without studying inundation maps first is thatearthquakes or not (and admittedly this part of India does suffer from severeearthquakes) no site anywhere in the Gulf of Cambay could possibly have beenabove water as recently as 4000 years ago – although 6000 years ago is gettingcloser. As we have seen, the Gulf of Cambay remained a valley until it wascompletely flooded by rising sea-levels at some point between 7700 years ago and6900 years ago.Then we must consider the scale of the ruins that the researchers from theNational Institute of Ocean Technology seem to have identified – this city thatis now underwater extends continuously for 9 kilometres, meaning that it is manytimes larger than Harappa or Mohenjodaro or any other city of theIndus-Sarasvati civilization yet discovered.Think how long it takes to build a city 9 kilometres long. A long time, surely?So even if the Gulf of Cambay was flooded at the latest possible date indicatedby Milne – 6900 years ago – we cannot reasonably suppose that the constructionof this enormous metropolis could have begun only one or two centuries beforethat. Surely it would require a millennium, maybe much longer, to build a cityso big?But if we allow a millennium, then that takes us back to somewhere around 8000years ago – 6000 BC – as the very latest date at which the city beneath the Gulfof Cambay could have been founded.A city 9 kilometres in extent and more than 3000 years older than Harappa andMohenjodaro would rewrite not only the history of the Indian subcontinent but ofthe world.It was the Holy Grail, all over again."},{"pageContent":"PART FOURMALTA"},{"pageContent":"15 / SMOKE AND FIRE IN MALTALord grant him eternal rest.SCICLUNA – COMMENDATORE SALVINO ANTHONY, passed peacefully away at St Luke’sHospital on June 11, aged 73, comforted by the rites of Holy Church.Sunday Times of Malta, 18 June 2000There is nothing looking remotely like one of these temples outside the MalteseIslands.D. H. Trump8 November 1999Some months begin badly, then get worse. November 1999 was like that for me.It started when Horizon, BBC TV’s flagship science series, aired ‘AtlantisReborn’ – a one-hour blitzkrieg on my character, my reputation and my work.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn1] But life had to go on, andUnderworld was not going to research and write itself.A central part of my research task, as I define it, is to check out personally-by scuba-diving – any and every sighting of anomalous underwater ruins thatcomes to my attention. On 8 November 1999, therefore, just four days after beingblitzed by Horizon, a sense of duty compelled me to fly to Malta to follow up astory that was then circulating on the Internet. Accompanied by ambiguouslyblurry colour photographs captured from videotape, the story concerned thediscovery – by a German named Hubert Zeitlmair – of a ruined megalithic temple 8metres underwater off Malta’s north-east coast.I had contacted Zeitlmair, and Santha and I had arranged to meet him on ourarrival in Malta later that afternoon. But now, as I passed the flight reviewingthe thin file of documents I had downloaded to my laptop, I had to admit thatthe auspices were not encouraging.A JOKE OR A HOAX?For example, in various unexplained but worrying ways something called the‘Palaeo-Astronaut Society’ was involved – thus virtually guaranteeing that theacademic authorities would treat the discovery as a joke or a hoax, irrespectiveof any merit it might have. Moreover, it very probably was a joke! By this timeI had done enough diving to know that 99.999 per cent of all mysterious‘man-made’ structures sighted underwater prove to be just weird geology ortricks of the light combined with wishful thinking. Only a tiny fraction checkout, and these are usually found by level-headed professional divers with noparticular theories to promote.As he was presented on the official ‘Maltadiscovery’ website, Hubert Zeitlmairseemed the antithesis of all that. He was described, unpromisingly, as a‘real-estate investor’, a ‘part-time archaeologist’, and a ‘fan’ of authorZecharia Sitchin (who believes that extra-terrestrial beings had a hand in theconstruction of megalithic sites around the world). Perhaps this was whyZeitlmair had chosen to announce his discovery of the Maltese underwater temple‘at a meeting of the Palaeo-Astronaut Society’ in his home town of Augsburg,Germany on 18 August 1999:The final dive that led to the discovery took place on July 13, 1999 at 10:00AM; and subsequent dives and underwater photography confirmed the nature andmegalithic size of the structures.The temple sits on an underwater plateau about 500 to 900 metres long. Thelowest point of the plateau is more than 25 metres below sea level and thehighest point of the plateau is about 7 metres below sea-level.The structure itself shows the same characteristics as the other above-groundtemples on Malta. Gigantic stone blocks aligned with astronomical significance,thought to be used as a calendar. The basic diameter of the interior rooms are6–7 metres and some of the highest walls that are still standing are about 4–6metres high. There is an avenue that goes up the centre of the structureindicating an orientation to the equinoxes. There are kidney-like formed roomsorientated to an easterly direction, which would coincide with the rising sunand the winter or summer solstices. The main difference is this structure isunderwater.Since the structure, as the others on Malta, had to be first built on solidground, its present underwater position could result from either the sinking(due to earthquakes?) of coastal parts of the island, or from a marked rise inthe sea-level (due to an immense flooding).Dr Zeitlmair adheres to the second possibility, and wonders whether the causewas the Great Flood described in the Bible and in the lore of many ancientpeoples, the so-called Noah’s Flood.He is inclined to this explanation because the west side wall of the structureis more overgrown by sea grass than the east side wall, apparently because therewas more sand deposited on that side. Therefore, the stones on the east side aremostly free of sea grass. This could indicate that the destructive water flowcame from the west into the Mediterranean Sea, adding confirmation to theoriesthat the water broke through the Strait of Gibraltar, filling the Mediterraneanbasin. A couple of big stones were lifted up and dropped down in a valley below,apparently by the destructive water flow.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn2]‘GREAT INTEREST AMONGST FOREIGN ARCHAEOLOGISTS …’The website also reprinted and translated a number of articles about thediscovery that had recently appeared in the press. I’d put these on to my laptopas well and now scrolled through them to see if they had anything to add.From II Mument (Maltese national newspaper), 31 October 1999:Recently, structures that resemble megalithic temples have been discovered onthe sea-bed in Maltese waters. These are currently being studied to establishwhether they are actually unique megalithic temples.This discovery has been considered to be of great archaeological importance, andhas raised great interest amongst foreign archaeologists …The discovery was made on the 13th of July 1999 at 10 a.m. and was photographed.The diver/cameraman who filmed the structures was Shaun Arrigo, while thephotographer who took the photos was his brother Kurt …So two Maltese diver-photographers, the brothers Shaun and Kurt Arrigo, had beeninvolved with Zeitlmair in the discovery – and had in fact taken the blurryphotographs that I had seen on the web.I would need to contact them.‘THE AGE FOR THE MEGALITHIC TEMPLES MUST BE CHANGED …’What next? I scrolled quickly through another article in the file. It hadappeared in the periodical Maltamag and contained an interview with Zeitlmair.But in the preamble written by reporter Daniel Mercieca, my eyes were drawn tothis paragraph:During a meeting with Joseph S. Ellul, a Maltese who has dedicated his life tothe study of prehistoric constructions, Dr Zeitlmair was shown a 1933 phototaken by the Royal Navy. This picture seemingly showed a megalithic constructionbelow the surface. Ellul confided to Dr Zeitlmair that he had proposed to thelocal authorities concerned to start research on site. Unfortunately, hissuggestion was never taken up, his numerous letters being left unanswered.In the interview Zeitlmair commented:Following my meetings with Joseph S. Ellul I strengthened my determination andcontacted various people about the subject. This led to the formation of a teamall set towards one goal – uncovering a temple under sea water. After severalfutile attempts at locating the site, success came on July 13th, 1999 at 10 a.m.Where exactly is the site of the discovery!It is located some mile and half off the Sliema coast … Incidentally, when Ifirst came to the islands, I was residing at the Diplomat Hotel in Sliema, whereI occupied a room with a superb sea-view. Now that the temples have beenlocated, I realize that the answer was lying under my nose for so long!What accounts for the site being underwater?Though further investigations have to be made, the Ice Age is most likely thecorrect answer to this. The last Ice Age ended around 13,000 years ago.Hopefully studies will prove that the ‘temples’ date back to that period.Could these findings change Malta’s history as we know it!Most certainly – and not only Malta’s! The age for the megalithic temples mustbe changed to 12,000 or 13,000 years ago. And the same applies to all theartifacts recovered from those periods. Malta may indeed prove that the earth’shistory as we know it must be changed.Now I had a new name – Joseph Ellul – to add to the list of contacts who I wouldneed to chase down in Malta, and new doubts about the exact provenance ofwhatever it was that had been discovered underwater off Sliema. For if the pressreports were correct, then: (a) Zeitlmair had not shot the original videofootage and photographs of the site (these were the work of Maltese divers Shaunand Kurt Arrigo); (b) Zeitlmair had got the idea for the location of the sitefrom a Maltese prehistorian named Joseph Ellul; and (c) Joseph Ellul was inpossession of an aerial photograph of the north-east coast of Malta thatactually showed the location of the site about a mile and a half off Sliema …‘CONFUSED …’The last article in my file was a sarcastic piece by Mark Rose in Archaeology,the journal of the Archaeological Institute of America. Entitled ‘The Truth, AndSome Other Stuff, is Out There’ it made heavy weather of Zeitlmair’sancient-astronaut enthusiasms and pointed out that:Chronology appears to be somewhat confused in Zeitlmair’s interpretation.According to the website, he sees links between the submerged ‘temple’ and bothNoah’s Flood and the rise in sea-level following the end of the Ice Age.Furthermore, the presence of deeper sand deposits on the west side of the‘ruins’, the side toward Gibraltar, than on the east side is taken as anindication that the flooding of the Mediterranean by Atlantic waters (whichreally did occur) was involved in the inundation of the ‘temple’. TheMediterranean flooding, however, took place some five million years ago.The Maltese Museum Department’s archaeology curator Reuben Grima has visited thesite, and was unconvinced that the stones on the seafloor are indeed a temple,according to archaeologist Anthony Bonanno of the University of Malta. Bonannohimself is skeptical of the find, noting that even if there is a submergedstructure it does not mean the temples need to be re-dated.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn3]Two more names for my list: Reuben Grima and Anthony Bonanno.The complete list now included Shaun Arrigo, Kurt Arrigo, Joseph Ellul, ReubenGrima, Anthony Bonanno. And, of course, Hubert Zeitlmair – whom Santha and I hadarranged to meet in the coffee lounge of the Diplomat Hotel in Sliema soon afterour arrival.Our plane was coming in over Malta now, gear down, ready to land. The islandblazed white with reflected light from its limestone outcrops and cliffs. Thesky was clear. The surrounding sea was deep blue and flat calm. Despite warningsthat November is an unpredictable month in this part of the Mediterranean, I hadevery reason to hope that we might be able to dive the next morning and settlethe matter of the underwater temple once and for all by thoroughly exploring andphotographing it.But it wasn’t going to be quite as easy or as straightforward as that.BIRD’S-EYE VIEW … (1)MALTA, 24 JUNE 2001I’m on board a helicopter – an old Soviet Mi8 with masses of room inside fortroops and great visibility out of the open door and rear window. It’s beenconverted for commercial use and I know for a fact that it served for severalyears as an air taxi in Bulgaria before ending up in Malta. Normally it fliespassengers between Malta and Gozo but this afternoon, thanks to Channel 4, wehave the exclusive charter of it for an hour.We take off from Luqa airport, hop straight up into the air 50 metres, circlewidely, then head north-east across the township of Paola that separates two ofMalta’s extraordinary prehistoric monuments – the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni(fully carved out of the living rock underground and thus not visible from theair) and the majestic Tarxien temple complex with its apsidal (‘kidney-shaped’)rooms, graceful spirals carved in relief, looming ‘mother-goddess’ figures andgigantic megaliths.Archaeological consensus dates Tarxien to between 3100 and 2500 BC while theHypogeum is thought to be a few hundred years older – with parts of it perhapsgoing back as far as 3600 BC.4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn4]Such a range of dates ranks these structures amongst the very oldest examples ofmonumental architecture yet to have been discovered anywhere on earth.And the problem is that they are clearly not the work of beginners. Themegaliths, some weighing 20 tonnes, perfectly balanced and integrated with oneanother in complex walls and passages, are hewn from the hard coralline andglobigerina limestone with which Malta is plentifully endowed and which to thisday affords the inhabitants their primary source of building materials. But nowit is sawn up into manageable blocks weighing only a few kilos and barely half ametre in length.We continue north-east across Grand Harbour to hover at 200 metres above thefairytale city of Valletta. It is much younger than the temples, belonging inevery sense to a different epoch of the earth, with most of its labyrinth ofnarrow alleyways and shadowed courtyards dating from the sixteenth century AD orlater. Yet Grand Harbour, now gleaming with gantry cranes unloading greatcontainer ships, was once itself the site of a megalithic temple – the remainsof which are believed to lie underwater, buried in deep silt and rubble, at thefoot of Fort Saint Angelo.5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn5]According to an eye-witness report by Jean Quintinus, this prehistoric templeextended over ‘a large part of the harbour, even far out into the sea’ as lateas AD 1536. In 1606 Megeiser could still see enough to note that it wasconstructed of ‘rectangular blocks of unbelievable sizes’. And even in thenineteenth century visitors reported ‘stones five to six feet long and laidwithout mortar’.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn6][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_075_r1.jpg]That nothing is left of the temple today does not surprise me. Since my firstresearch visit to Malta in November 1999 I’ve learned that objects – and evenplaces – of archaeological importance can and do disappear here in mysteriousways. For example, ancient remains of an estimated 7000 people were found in theHypogeum of Hal Saflieni, buried in a matrix of red earth, when it was excavatedby Sir Themistocles Zammit at the beginning of the twentieth century.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn7] Today only six skulls are left,stashed out of public view in two plastic crates in the cavernous vaults ofMalta’s National Museum of Archaeology. Nobody has the faintest idea what hashappened to all the rest of the bones. They’ve just ‘vanished’, according toofficials at the Museum.8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn8]And the six skulls? After much pressure and protest I have been allowed to seethem only this morning and they are – I must confess – extremely andunsettlingly odd. They are weirdly elongated – dolichocephalic is the technicalterm but this is dolichocephalism of the most extreme form. And one of theskulls, though that of an adult, is entirely lacking in the fossa median – theclearly-visible ‘join’ that runs along the top of the head where two plates ofbone are separated in infancy (thus facilitating the process of birth) but laterjoin together in adulthood. I should be paying attention to the fantastic viewsand seascapes unfolding beneath the helicopter but I keep on wondering: whatwould people with skulls like that have looked like during life? How could theyhave survived birth and grown to adulthood? And did the other skulls from theHypogeum – the lost skulls, the lost bones – also show the same distinctivepeculiarity?Still at 200 metres, the helicopter is now flying north-west from Valletta toSliema, following the contours of the coast, taking me over waters that I’vedived in many times since November 1999 following the trail of HubertZeitlmair’s elusive temple …HUBERTWORLD … (1)MALTA, 8 NOVEMBER 1999Zeitlmair met us, as we had arranged, in the coffee lounge of the Diplomat Hotelin Sliema. He proved to be a tall, rather dashing man in his mid-forties withlong, well-groomed, salt-and-pepper hair, stylish clothes, a soldierly bearingand an impressive moustache. Within a few minutes it had also become obviousthat he was severely sight-impaired, if not entirely blind, and he explained,without rancour, that this was the result of a viral infection of the eyes thathe had suffered during a period of military service.I ventured that his disability must have made diving very difficult – when hewas searching for the underwater temple. But he shrugged off my concerns. ‘Ofcourse,’ he explained, ‘I didn’t dive myself. I wouldn’t have been able to see athing. I guided the divers to the site and they went down to take thephotographs and get the evidence.’‘You mean Shaun and Kurt Arrigo?’‘Yes,’ Zeitlmair exclaimed in the manner of a man suppressing a sneeze, ‘theArrigos.’Until that moment I thought I had come to Malta to dive with Hubert Zeitlmair,the discoverer of the submerged temple off the Sliema coast. Indeed, we haddiscussed the matter by telephone and he had confirmed that a boat and tanks forup to four dives had been arranged for the following day for that specificpurpose. The fact that Zeitlmair himself turned out to be a blind non-diver didnot necessarily jeopardize those arrangements, of course. Nevertheless, Ithought it was time for some clarification.‘So well be diving with Shaun and Kurt Arrigo tomorrow?’ I asked. ‘They’re theones who know the location?’‘I know the location,’ asserted Zeitlmair into his cappuccino. ‘It was I who ledthe Arrigos to it in the first place …’‘No offence,’ – I had to ask – ‘but how did you do that? I mean, since youreyesight is so poor, how did you manage to lead them there?’At this point Zeitlmair conjured from his briefcase a magnifying glass and alarge black-and-white aerial photograph of the coast of Malta between Vallettaand Sliema. As he rolled the photograph out on the table between us he said, ‘Iwas able to lead them to the site because of the indications … here.’ Squintinghis eye to the glass and lowering his head he eventually found what looked to melike a pattern of white dots on the photograph in an area of open sea north-eastof Sliema. ‘This is the site of the temple,’ he announced. ‘The photograph wastaken by the British Royal Navy some time before World War II. The sky and seawere exceptionally clear, and the site became visible to the camera through thewater …’Well … Maybe. Or maybe it was just light reflecting off dust on the lens.‘Is this the photograph you got from Joseph Ellul?’ I asked‘Yes, from Ellul. That’s right.’We then entered into a long, rambling, muddled discussion about who haddiscovered what. I was on autopilot through most of this, but the gist of it wasZeitlmair’s claim to have developed a theory concerning the locations of Maltesemegalithic sites which predicted the presence of a structure underwater offSliema. The theory had to do with the well-known ‘pairing’ of temples in Malta,one on high ground and the other in the valley below it (as is the case atSkorba and Mgarr, for example, or at Hagar Qim and Mnajdra).9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn9] To this day I cannot understandwhich temple exactly Zeitlmair has in mind for the high ground around Sliema,and I am not clear whether his theory takes into account the ancient traditionsof a megalithic temple in Grand Harbour. Still, what he’s getting at iscompletely obvious: when sea-level was lower 12,000 or 15,000 years ago, thereefs around Malta, now submerged to depths of 100 metres or so, would all havebeen above water and the pleasantly sloping valley below Sliema might haveseemed an ideal spot in which to build a temple.As Zeitlmair told it, he was already geared up to fund a diving expedition offSliema in order to test this theory; indeed, had bought a flat in Sliema to useas a base for the expedition, when his providential meeting with Joseph Elluloccurred. Ellul showed him the Royal Navy photograph which, he was convinced,pinpointed the exact place off Sliema in which the expedition should dive –roughly 2.5 kilometres from land along a bearing 65 degrees north-east off SaintGeorge’s Tower.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn10]‘Although the location is quite far from shore,’ Zeitlmair continued, ‘where thewater is generally more than 40 metres deep, I reasoned that there must be somesort of reef or shallows there to show up so clearly on the photograph -maybe alittle sea-mount, or something like that, a high point standing above thesurrounding valley, just the sort of place the temple builders would haveappreciated … Then I hired the Arrigos to get me to the site in their boat andto search the bottom with an echo-sounder. I figured if the echo-soundersuddenly started giving shallow readings in an area of generally deep water, andif we were about 2.5 or 3 kilometres from shore, then we would have found theright place.’I frowned: ‘But why did you need the echosounder? Surely a shallow spot likethat would show up on nautical charts? If it’s charted you should be able to seta course straight to it. No need to search.’Zeitlmair shrugged: ‘It is not charted … But still it is there. You will seetomorrow.’BIRD’S-EYE VIEW … (2)MALTA, 24 JUNE 2001The helicopter is at 200 metres, flying north-west from Valletta to Sliema about1 kilometre from shore. To our right is the open ocean – and somewhere out therethe ‘sea-mount’ that shows up as a glimmer of pale dots on the Navy photograph.Was it ever a real place? Or just a trick of the light?Despite the bad start that I undoubtedly made with Zeitlmair and the Arrigos inNovember 1999, my confidence has been growing for more than a year now thatthere could, after all, be something solid behind all the rumours of anunderwater temple off Sliema …THE CASE OF COMMANDER SCICLUNAMALTA, 15 JUNE 2000Joseph Ellul looks as old and as sturdy as a megalith, and his house in thesunlit village of Zurrieq is named after the nearby temple at Hagar Qim – to thestudy of which he has devoted most of his life. He speaks loudly, has certaineccentric mannerisms, and once launched on the subject of Malta’s prehistoryincreases enormously in size and becomes unstoppable.Ellul’s particular theory – based in some obscure way that I do not understandon the differential weathering-rates of coralline and globigerina limestone – isthat the megalithic temples of his native islands were originally built morethan 12,000 years ago by a prehistoric civilization, and were much laterdestroyed by the biblical deluge (which, he reckons, took place 5000 years ago].Ellul sets out this theory in his 1988 book Malta’s Prediluvian Culture at theStone Age Temples – a book that has been entirely overlooked by archaeologistsbecause of its cranky Creationist approach and unfortunate emphasis on animpossible mechanism for the deluge. This mechanism, in Ellul’s opinion, was acataclysmic penetration of the Straits of Gibraltar by the Atlantic Ocean 5000years ago, resulting in instant flooding, from the west, of the previously dryMediterranean basin. Such a penetration (as Michael Rose points out in thejournal of the Archaeological Institute of America cited earlier) did indeedoccur – 5 million years before Ellul suggests.Other aspects of Ellul’s theory are less far-fetched and he has somewell-reasoned arguments about flood damage at Hagar Qim – but this was not whatI had come to talk to him about that day in June 2000 on the second of my threebig research visits to Malta. Having failed to make contact with him in November1999, I was here now exclusively to find out if he could shed any fresh light onthe mystery of Zeitlmair’s missing underwater temple. It immediately becameobvious, however, that Ellul did not regard the temple as in any way being‘Zeitlmair’s’, or missing, and that he clearly felt aggrieved about how his ownrole in the discovery had been interpreted.Muttering in Maltese, he shuffled to a wardrobe positioned in the hall outsidehis kitchen and took down from it a rolled photographic print. It proved to beanother, larger version of the aerial view of the Sliema coast that Zeitlmairhad shown me the previous November. At the foot of it Ellul had drawn in a scaleby hand and had typed the following legend: ‘Undersea Prehistoric ruins situatedat Direction Bearing 65 degrees NE of St George’s Tower, 2.5 kilometres fromland at a depth of 25 feet’.11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn11]I was puzzled by one of the figures and asked: ‘You got the depth fromZeitlmair, I suppose, after the Arrigos dived on the temple in 1999?’Ellul favoured me with a sinister smile. ‘No,’ he replied, ‘I got the depth fromanother Maltese diver, Commander Scicluna, in 1994.’He shuffled off and returned with a much marked and tagged copy of his book inwhich he had been incorporating corrections for a new edition. He opened thebook and from a small stack of papers folded inside the front cover pulled out apress clipping. The clipping, from the letters page of the Sunday Times ofMalta, was dated 20 February 1994 and was a response to an article on thesubject of sea-level rise that had appeared in the paper on 13 February 1994:SEA-LEVEL CHANGESFrom Comm. S. A. SciclunaTHE ARTICLE ‘Sea-level changes of the past and present’ by Peter Gatt (theSunday Times, February 13) indicates that Malta’s shores are going down at therate of 2 mm a year … This is taking place in many Mediterranean countries,especially in Sicily, which is very close to us. At Marsameni and Motya, theevidence is very clear because both of them are now underwater.In Malta this evidence is also clear. There are three sites which are nowcompletely under water: the oil wells at Saint George’s Bay in Birzebuga(mentioned by P. P. Castagna in Malta u il-Gzejjer Tagha), a rock-cut tomb inSliema (exactly like the ones in Bingemma) – this is now in 25 feet of water;and a prehistoric temple I located last summer under 25 feet of water, also atSliema.I myself reported this find to President Tabone, to Dr Michael Frendo, Ministerof Youth and Arts, and to Dr Tancred Gouder, Director of Museums.S. A. Scicluna,SliemaCommander Scicluna, eh? Another name for my list. Plus of course PresidentTabone, Dr Michael Frendo and Tancred Gouder. It would be interesting to learnif any of these three, presuming they were still with us, had done anything atall to follow up Scicluna’s claim to have found a temple underwater off Sliema.Because unlike Zeitlmair, whose zany associations with ancient astronauts mustnot be held against him – but who unfortunately could not dive – it transpiredthat Scicluna was an archaeological diver of some renown who had led severalunderwater expeditions and received commendations from the British Navy and fromthe British Committee of Nautical Archaeology.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn12] When such a suitably qualifiedand experienced man chooses to state in a national newspaper that he has found aprehistoric temple underwater, it is appropriate that he be taken seriously.But had he been? After parting company with Ellul and returning to the flat thatSantha and I had rented that June, I tried directory inquiries for CommanderScicluna’s number. They couldn’t help me. Then I called Manjri Bindra, a friendof ours in Malta who is very good at finding people, and within an hour she hadthe number for me.I dialled and waited. There was a long delay, then a woman’s voice answered thephone: ‘Hello.’‘Oh. Yes. Hello. Er … My name is Graham Hancock. Is this Commander Scicluna’sresidence?’ Another delay, then: ‘Yes.’‘Oh, good. Look, I’m sorry to disturb you, but please may I speak to him?’Silence.‘I’m an author,’ I gabbled, ‘I’m researching a book about underwater ruins, andI understand that Commander Scicluna is a great expert in this field. I wouldlike to speak to him about a temple, underwater, that he discovered off Sliema…’‘I’m afraid that will be impossible.’I was nonplussed: ‘Why?’ I protested. ‘I just need to speak with him for a fewmoments, to confirm something.’‘I regret that my husband passed away four days ago’, the lady replied.Now, all at once, I understood the sadness and fatigue in her voice andstammered my apologies for disturbing her.‘It is all right’, she said wearily.HUBERTWORLD … (2)MALTA, 9 NOVEMBER 1999Santha and I sat in the coffee lounge of the Diplomat Hotel in Sliema drinkingcappuccinos with Hubert Zeitlmair. We had been there since 8 a.m.; it was now 9and there was still no sign of the Arrigo brothers showing up in their truck totake us diving. This was annoying, as we were already partly dressed for thewater, had our mesh bags packed at our feet, and could observe that the sea inwhich we had been expecting even now to be preparing to dive, was calm, windlessand generally perfect for our enterprise.‘I don’t understand it,’ Zeitlmair was saying. ‘We had a firm agreement thatthey would pick us up this morning at eight. Everything was arranged. I spokewith them myself just yesterday.’We had already tried to phone the Arrigos’ dive shop, and their mobiles, butwithout success. Admittedly it was still early, but it was odd that they were souncontactable – and so not here. Was Malta going to be a bust? I was beginningto think so. Because, after all, even if an underwater temple did exist atSliema, why should the Arrigos take me to it? In the event that it wasarchaeologically important, then it was sooner or later going to become a hotmedia property; meanwhile, the Arrigos’ interests, and the interests of thesite, might be best served by keeping its location confidential.It was obvious even then that the matter of ‘proprietorship’ was far fromsettled. Zeitlmair had a strong claim, to be sure, but it was by no means freeof encumbrances – and who was to say that he would ever be able to relocate his‘temple’ should the Arrigos decide not to cooperate? Even in the bestcircumstances objects found underwater are easily lost again unless accurateshore-bearings have been taken from the boat – impossible for the blind – or aGPS has been used to record the precise latitude and longitude of the entrypoint.‘Do you have GPS numbers for the site?’ I now asked Zeitlmair.‘No,’ he confessed, ‘but I told you already it is very simple to find it. Wejust go out 2.5 or 3 kilometres from Saint George’s Tower and use the echosounder …’‘Until we come to a reef that is shallower than the surrounding water?’‘Exactly. Then we will be on the spot.’Around 11 a.m. we finally managed to get a call through to Shaun Arrigo’s mobilephone.It transpired that the two brothers and their father – who ran the divingbusiness together – were on a boat off Gozo and would not be back in Malta untilthe evening of the following day. Although they knew of me and my visit, theyclaimed that no arrangement whatsoever had been made by Zeitlmair for them toguide me to the underwater temple that morning, and that they wanted to meet mefirst in order to discuss the matter further before deciding whether they wishedto guide me at all. Besides, it was the law of the land that I should becertified medically fit by a Maltese doctor before I would be allowed to dive inMaltese waters. Had I yet obtained such a certificate? No? Then that too neededto be arranged. They proposed that I call round to their dive shop in two daystime, on 11 November, to see if we could ‘work things out’.Silently fuming at myself for not having dealt directly with the Arrigos fromthe beginning in a matter as important as this, I turned to Zeitlmair: ‘Are yousure you can find the site again?’‘Sure!’ he barked.He did sound sure.‘OK, then, Hubert, here’s what I suggest we do …’BIRD’S-EYE VIEW … (3)MALTA, 24 JUNE 2001We’ve left Sliema behind and now the helicopter is rushing rapidly west alongthe north coast of Malta. Dropping our altitude to 100 metres, we soar overWhite Rocks and head for Qawra Point – a finger-shaped promontory dividingSalina Bay from Saint Paul’s Bay.There we circle and hover above the spot in the sea where two days before ChrisAgius, a new friend who has come to our aid in Malta within the past month, ledus on a dive to a remarkable straight canal cut out of the solid limestone ofthe sea-bed at a depth of 25 metres. A low bridge, also hewn out of the bedrock,spans the canal at one point, and Chris has identified tool marks on its innerwalls …13 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn13]We fly on, crossing Saint Paul’s Bay and Mellieha Bay, crossing the Gozo Channelfrom Cirkewwa with the tiny midway island of Comino to our right. And I rememberthat here, too, somewhere in the channel between Malta and Comino, a prehistoricstone circle is rumoured to exist. In fact it is rather more than a rumour,since I have talked directly with one of the commercial divers who saw thestructure before – as he claims – it was buried by developers beneath concretepilings …It would not be the first time in Malta that an archaeological discovery hasbeen conveniently hushed up to allow a construction project to go ahead. Thesame thing happened at the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni, which was entered andlooted by labourers renovating houses above it at the end of the nineteenthcentury at least three years before archaeologists ever learned of itsexistence. The initial discovery was very deliberately not reported to theauthorities for fear that they would sequester the site.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn14]HUBERTWORLD … (3)MALTA, 9–10 NOVEMBER 1999After the failure of communication over our dive plans with the Arrigos for the9th I felt superstitious. I therefore made the decision to hire a boat and divesupport from another dive shop and mount an entirely new search for theunderwater temple without the Arrigos’ help. Zeitlmair agreed and issued severalmore cheering statements to the effect that he would lead us straight to thespot, having got the Arrigos there before without any difficulty, etc….In character with the general pattern of annoyance and frustration that seemedto have draped itself around me that November, I then took our business to adive-shop staffed by pessimists and safety fanatics who began issuing direwarnings about the weather, and various dangers associated with diving in Maltain the winter months, virtually from the moment that I walked in their door.It took all of the rest of the 9th to sort out the medical certificates, findand hire the right type of boat, and tie up the arrangements for dive assistancethe next day.But the 10th dawned grey, stormy and windblown, with white-caps breaking out inthe open sea in front of Sliema. Santha and I looked gloomily at the waves fromour balcony in the Diplomat Hotel and decided that we would chance it. We haddived in worse. And the boat that we had hired was a 50 foot motorized lutzu(traditional Maltese fishing vessel) that should, in theory, be able to handlethese conditions without too much difficulty. We might take a bit of a poundinggetting back on board after each dive, but that was acceptable. While we weresubmerged we should face no problems.Our new dive suppliers did not agree. What if there was a current and we were toget swept away from the boat? It was sturdy but not very fast and in high seasit might lose us completely. Sliema was not some enclosed bay, after all. Thenext landfall was Sicily, 90 kilometres to the north.More badgering followed along these lines and I was eventually obliged toconcede that diving was probably not a very good idea that day …BIRD’S-EYE VIEW … (4)MALTA, 24 JUNE 2001Our hour in the helicopter is rapidly ticking by. We’ve passed Comino and hoverover Gozo’s Mgarr Harbour before heading into the heart of the island. There,south of Xaghra – itself the site of a huge semi-subterranean stone circle – isthe necromancer’s castle, the ‘Giant’s Tower’ of Gigantija, the greatest and theoldest of the megalithic temples of the Maltese archipelago, reckoned to havebeen built around 3600 BC.Looking down on it from above, I am struck not only by its enormous size butalso by the way in which it faithfully and exactly reproduces what may bethought of as the ‘canon’ of all the Maltese megalithic temples – an outerretaining wall of cyclopean blocks, some up to 5 metres high and many in therange of 15 tonnes or more, set out in a series of expansive, graceful curves toenclose an irregular space that feels more organic than architectural. Thisinner space contains a series of altars, shrines and large apsidal roomsinterconnected by axial passageways, all of which are also lined with hugemegaliths of mixed coralline and globigerina limestone.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_076_r1.jpg]Floorplan of Gigantija temple. Based on Evans (1971).Unlike other simpler temples, Gigantija features two distinct and not quiteparallel axial passages oriented east of south which dominate the whole complex.By means of imposing stone gateways, each of these passages penetrates a concavemegalithic façade defining the only two ‘entrances’ to the structure. Theeasternmost axis leads to four large apsidal rooms arranged in two pairs ofopposed lobes. The westernmost axis leads to five apses – two arranged as anopposing pair and the remaining three in the form of a clover-leaf.Orthodox scholarly opinion holds that the islands of the Maltese archipelagoremained entirely uninhabited until 5200 BC - 7200 years ago – when they weresettled by Neolithic agriculturalists from nearby Sicily.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn15]Orthodox scholarly opinion dates Gigantija to 3600 BC - 5600 years ago.The time lapse between settlement 7200 years ago and the construction ofGigantija 5600 years ago is 1600 years. And while there is evidence ofsmall-scale construction and the hewing out of rock tombs in the Maltese islandsduring this period, there is nothing from the excavation record thatarchaeologists are able to show us which in any way seriously charts theevolution of the temple-building phase. On the contrary:The temple builders did not begin with small-scale structures. Gigantija … is atremendous work of architectural design and of engineering, built a thousandyears before the date usually given for the Great Pyramid.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn16]To this Colin Renfrew, Professor of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge,adds:The façade [of Gigantija], perhaps the earliest architecturally conceivedexterior in the world, is memorably imposing. Large slabs of corallinelimestone, set alternatively end-on and sideways on, rise to a height of eightmetres; these slabs are up to four metres high for the first course, and abovethis six courses of megalithic blocks still survive. A small temple model of theperiod suggests that originally the façade may have been as high as 16 metres.17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn17]Cyclopean walls 16 metres high? At first sight, admits Renfrew,it seems inconceivable that such monuments could be built without theorganization and the advanced technology of a truly urban civilization … Yetaccording to the radiocarbon chronology, the temples are the earliestfree-standing monuments of stone in the world. In the Near East at about thistime, 3000 BC and perhaps even earlier, the mud-brick temples of the‘proto-literate period’ of Sumerian civilization were evolving: impressivemonuments in themselves but something very different from the Maltesestructures.18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn18]How are we to explain the fact that the oldest free-standing stone monuments inthe world, which by virtue of their size and sophistication unambiguouslydeclare themselves to have been built by a people who had already accumulatedlong experience in the science of megalithic construction, appear on thearchaeological scene on a group of very small islands – the Maltese archipelago– that had not even been inhabited by human beings until 1600 years previously?Isn’t this counter-intuitive? Wouldn’t one expect a ‘civilization history’ toshow up in the Maltese archaeological record documenting ever-more sophisticatedconstruction techniques – and indeed wouldn’t one also expect an extensive‘civilization territory’ capable of supporting a reasonably sized population(rather than tiny barren islands) to surround and nourish the greatestarchitectural leap forward of antiquity?Dr Anton Mifsud, President of the Prehistoric Society of Malta, who we will behearing from a great deal in the coming chapters, offers this succinct summaryof the problem: ‘Malta is presently too small in size to have sustained theearliest architectural civilization; its civilization territory is missing.’19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn19]We circle over Gigantija one more time, then bank sharply to the south-east,cross the Gozo Channel again and hover over a rugged spot called Marfa Point atthe extremity of the main island of Malta.Here, underwater, two days previously, we saw further strange channels cut inthe rock, some running in distinctive parallel tracks, leading to the edge of adrop-off at 8 metres. Beneath the drop-off we were shown a terrace of threelarge right-angled steps cut into the interior of a cave at 25 metres.Could the ‘civilization territory’ of Malta be missing because it is nowunderwater?HUBERTWORLD … (4)MALTA, 11–13 NOVEMBER 1999I didn’t keep the loose appointment that I had made to try to ‘work things out’with the Arrigos on 11 November, but I also did not go diving that day; 2 metrewaves whipped up by the strong prevailing wind from the north-east stillprohibited that.On the 12th and 13th, however, much to the astonishment of our pessimistic divehosts, the north-easterly lulled, the angry seas subsided and we were able totake the lutzu out and begin searching with the echo-sounder for Zeitlmair’suncharted sea-mount between 2.5 and 3 kilometres from shore.Within an hour of zigzagging back and forth across water generally 40 to 70metres deep we suddenly stumbled upon a shallow point where the echo-soundergave a depth of just 7 metres – more or less exactly as Zeitlmair had promised.It was with the air of a man vindicated, therefore, that he stood by beamingshort-sightedly as the lutzu was anchored and we prepared to dive.But we couldn’t find his temple – only a series of disparate features that insome way resembled, but did not actually seem to be, the features that ShaunArrigo had videoed a few months previously in July 1999.I felt incredibly disappointed, crushed and depressed after those dives, whichhad seemed so promising initially, and began to believe that we might never findthe site if we went on this way – for the same reason that the man on the beachcan never count all the grains of sand. By close of business on the 13th,therefore, I had decided to set pride aside, go back to the Arrigos cap in hand,and beg them to take me to their – or Zeitlmair’s – or whoever the hell’s templeit was.In my opinion no one owned the temple … if it existed at all. I certainly had nodesire to own it or lay any kind of claim to it. I just wanted to dive it.REUBEN GRIMA’S SHORT DIVE IN A THUNDERSTORMMALTA, 19 JUNE 2000The ‘Zeitlmair file’ in my laptop during my first visit to Malta in November1999 had contained a report from the journal Archaeology that seemed to writeoff the significance of the underwater temple right from the start. According tothat report Reuben Grima, archaeology curator at Malta’s National Museum, haddived at the Sliema site and was ‘unconvinced that the stones on the sea-floorare indeed a temple’. Quoted alongside Grima was Professor Anthony Bonanno ofthe University of Malta, who made the point that even if a ruined temple hadbeen found underwater, its submersion did not necessarily mean that all Maltesetemples had to be redated.20 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn20]Bonanno’s observation was completely correct. It would be necessary to establishthe mechanism of submergence of the site (land subsidence versus sea-level rise)before jumping to any conclusions about the age of any structures on it – andthis had not been done yet. On the other hand there would be little point inestablishing anything at all about the site if the ‘megaliths’ and‘kidney-shaped rooms’ that had been seen and photographed there were not in factparts of a temple at all but just natural formations that had beenmisinterpreted by excited amateurs – as Reuben Grima seemed to have concludedafter his dive.In November 1999 I had been too depressed to do anything much but stubbornly andrepeatedly go diving myself in the cold waters off Sliema – trying to get somehands-on experience of the structure so that I could form my own opinions. Ihadn’t contacted Reuben Grima then, so he was still on my agenda when I returnedin June 2000 to resume the dive search.I had arranged our appointment for 19 June – rather than any other day – with acertain ulterior motive. Santha and I wanted permission to be inside the ‘lowertemple’ at the megalithic site of Mnajdra at dawn on the 20th, the summersolstice and the longest day of the year. Reuben Grima was one of the few peoplewho had the power to grant this very rare privilege – and he did so with goodgrace and one telephone call to supervisory staff at Mnajdra. ‘I understand theeffect is spectacular,’ he said with a smile, ‘but you should be there before 5a.m. The watchmen will be expecting you …’I told him that I wasn’t any kind of archaeologist, just a popular writer, so heshould excuse me in advance if I seemed ignorant of archaeological proceduresand facts or if I asked naive questions. There was, however, something botheringme about the dating and ‘sequencing’ of the megalithic temples of Malta withinthe period 3600 to 2500 BC, and the dating of the first human habitation ofMalta to 5200 BC. ‘How have you arrived at these dates?’ I asked.As I had been expecting, Grima explained that the primary tool in establishingMalta’s prehistoric chronology had been radiocarbon-dating (based on the rate ofdecay of C-14 stored in all formerly living matter).21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn21] My views about C-14 are on therecord.22 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn22] I think it should beonly one amongst several tools and techniques brought to bear on the dating ofmegalithic or rock-hewn sites. It is a truism, but worth repeating nevertheless,that C-14 cannot date stone – only such organic materials as are found around orin association with stone ruins. It is an assumption (more or less safedepending on the stratigraphy and general circumstances of the site but still,at the end of the day, an assumption) that organic materials found close tomegalith B or trilithon A or dolmen C, etc., do in fact date from the sameperiod as the quarrying and erection of the megaliths concerned.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_077_r1.jpg]To this extent the excavation of a megalithic site is a bit like a crime scene.If the scene has been properly protected from contamination and intrusiveelements, then the results of any forensic tests are likely to be much moreaccurate and useful than they will be if the scene has been disturbed. C-14dating is a forensic test. And looked at as crime scenes, Malta’s megalithictemples are pre-eminently ‘disturbed’ – since they have been used as quarriesand goat pens by local farmers for millennia, in some cases arbitrarilyreconstructed on a whim,23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn23] anddug over with great enthusiasm and little skill by amateur archaeologists for atleast 200 years before the introduction of carbon-dating in the mid-twentiethcentury.But when I put these objections to Grima he brushed them aside: ‘Look, of courseit’s possible that new evidence might yet be unearthed which would require somerevision of our chronology for Maltese prehistory. But I think, after all theseyears and the application of so many eminent minds to the problem, that we’veprobably got things pretty well right. If we’re wrong it will be at the most bya few centuries, not by millennia. So we’re not expecting any big surprises.’‘How many carbon-dated samples does the orthodox chronology here actually dependon?’ I asked.‘For the temples?’‘Yes, and the Hypogeum too.’‘Well, very few actually.’‘Do you remember how many?’‘Off the top of my head, I don’t. But I can easily check. I know it’s not alarge number.’‘And out of this not very large number of carbon-dated samples from the templeperiod how many were actually taken from underneath undisturbed megaliths?’‘As far as I know none were,’ replied Grima.This seemed a good moment to turn the conversation to the subject of theunderwater temple off Sliema.‘I understand you dived on it,’ I said. ‘What did you make of it?’Grima raised his hands in a theatrical shrug: ‘Not very much. But then to befair, I didn’t see it properly’.He had gone to the site with Shaun Arrigo, he explained, rather late oneafternoon with a thunderstorm brewing. The conditions had looked bad. Moreover,Arrigo claimed not to be sure of the precise location of the ‘temple7. Then soonafter they dropped into the water and began to look for it, Grima discoveredthat by mistake he had strapped on a half-empty tank. Bearing in mind thedeteriorating surface conditions he had therefore been obliged to abort the diveafter only ten minutes. ‘The visibility was awful,’ he added, ‘and we might noteven have been in the right place, but what I saw looked like pretty much justordinary sea-bottom to me.’‘It might well have been. But the question is – was what you saw the same thingthat Zeitlmair is claiming is a temple?7Grima clearly had some difficulty taking Zeitlmair and his ancient astronautsseriously and I could understand why he might be sceptical of any claimsemanating from such a source. However, irrespective of his, or my, or anyoneelse’s views on Zeitlmair, I felt that the proposition of a submerged, man-madeprehistoric structure off Sliema was an eminently testable hypothesis whichcould be proved or disproved empirically by diving on it, thoroughlyphotographing it and collecting samples.Grima’s ten minutes in a thunderstorm didn’t even begin to qualify as a test. Sono matter how wacky its proponents might seem to be, the hypothesis that atemple could be there had still not been refuted as far as I was concerned.Besides, there had been nothing wacky about Commander Scicluna.As I was leaving his office at the National Museum in Valletta, I asked Grima ifhe was aware that six years before Zeitlmair, Scicluna had also reported theexistence of a megalithic temple underwater off Sliema, and at pretty much thesame depth.Grima said he knew nothing of the case and asked me to whom it had been beenreported.‘To Tancred Gouder, amongst others. I understand he was Director of Museums atthat time. Scicluna mentioned the discovery in a letter to the Sunday Times ofMalta in March 1994. I’m really surprised it wasn’t followed up …’BIRD’S-EYE VIEW … (5)MALTA, 24 JUNE 2001We’ve left Marfa Point and are flying over the sea parallel to the wall of sheercliffs, in some places hundreds of metres high, stacked up along the westerncoast of Malta. I’m told that these cliffs exist because this side of the islandhas been slowly but steadily rising over several millions of years as a resultof geological upheavals along the submarine Pantalleria Rift – levering itselfup out of the sea-bed at an annual rate of a millimetre or two and causing theeastern side of the island, by the law of equal and opposite force, to tiltdownwards.24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn24] That means that theSliema coast, with its rumours of an underwater temple, has experienced somedegree of submergence during the past 17,000 years not only on account of risingsea-levels at the end of the Ice Age but also because of the longer-term processof land-subsidence that is still underway today.We skip over Paradise Bay and then, in quick succession, Anchor Bay, Golden Bay,with its beach umbrellas and racks of lobster-pink tourists, Ghajn Tuffieha Bayand Gnejna Bay. Then we turn inland over the Bahrija valley and the Wied ir-Rumwith the twin medieval towns of Mdina and Rabat to our left and the sea to ourright.Malta’s landscape is everywhere rugged and stony, sliced through with plungingvalleys, crumbling escarpments and dark defiles – a racked and torturedtopography twisted, moulded and scoured out by extreme natural forces overaeons. It is easy to overlook the implications of so much rocky ruggedness anddrama being compressed into such a small space, but as Anton Mifsud explains:The present surface area of the Maltese islands is not sufficient to account forthe extensive valley formations such as the Wied il-Ghasel, Wied il-Ghasri andWied ix-Xlendi, amongst others. The creation of such deep and precipitousvalleys would have required a very extensive land surface to hold the waterswhich dug them out over the millennia.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn25]And Mifsud is right. The Maltese archipelago was once much bigger – indeed somuch bigger that it wasn’t an archipelago at all. Around 17,000 years ago, atthe Last Glacial Maximum when sea-level was more than 120 metres lower than itis today, the three main islands of Malta, Comino and Gozo, as well as littleFilfla in the south, were all joined into one landmass, itself joined by a wideand extensive land-bridge to Sicily 90 kilometres to the north – which was inturn joined to the ‘toe’ of the Italian mainland. Glenn Milne’s inundation maps,as we shall see in chapter 19 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c19_r1.htm#c19], leave nodoubt about the overall picture while more detailed bathymetric studies revealthe antediluvian central Mediterranean to have been an area of potentiallyenormous interest to the story of human civilization that has been almostentirely neglected by the responsible scholars.HUBERTWORLD … (5)MALTA, IS NOVEMBER 1999Malta is a small place, word of the search that Zeitlmair and I had beenconducting off Sliema had got around, and I used the same lutzu and crew fordiving with the Arrigos that I had used to try to locate ‘their’ site with acompetitor dive-shop just a couple of days previously. None of thisheavy-handedness helped to promote good relations, and I am certain that Shaunand Kurt Arrigo, and their father whose name I presently forget, must haveregarded me as an entirely unpleasant and untrustworthy customer and a completeidiot into the bargain.We spent the 14th engaged in angry discussions, recriminations and speeches ofself-justification but on the 15th we went diving. Kurt couldn’t make it, norcould Arrigo senior, so I dived with Shaun Arrigo, who looks like a pirate. Heis young – about thirty and physically fit, with long black hair, a hawk nose,hooded eyes and seven days of stubble. To my surprise, however, he claimed thathe was not sure of the exact location of the site and that we would have tosearch for it. With a sense of déjà vu I stood by as the boat zigzagged back andforth over a range of depths, bearings and distances from shore with ShaunArrigo repeatedly asserting that the site was not as far out as Zeitlmair stillbelieved.‘Well, how far out is it?’ I asked.‘Three kilometres,’ interjected Zeitlmair.‘One kilometre,’ insisted Arrigo.We used the echosounder to chart the bottom at both distances and at all pointsin between, but couldn’t find the right profile anywhere. Meanwhile, theweather, which had been calm a little earlier, had changed character, assumingan ominous tone as clouds massed overhead. Beneath the keel of the lutzu all ofus could feel the long rolling upsurge of a heavy swell – more scary in a waythan breaking waves because of its aura of suppressed violence and power. Thewaters that had been blue just half an hour before were now transmuted to darkgrey, almost black, and the air temperature had plunged. Even wearing a wetsuitI shivered. The shoreline between Sliema and Saint Juliens seemed far off acrossthe heaving sea. Was I seriously planning to dive in this?Then the captain called out from the cabin that the echosounder was giving adepth of 20 metres … 19 … 18.5 … 18 metres.‘We’ll go in here,’ yelled Arrigo, peering wildly over the side and alreadystrapping on his tank and BCD.I hurried to follow suit while the boat was brought to a standstill. By then,however, we had drifted off the 18 metre contour and the captain announced thatwe were now in between 25 and 30 metres of water.‘We’ll go in here,’ Arrigo repeated. ‘If it’s the right place we’ll find thatthe reef slopes up fairly steadily from 25 metres to 7 or 8 metres. All weshould have to do is follow the slope of the reef as it gets shallower and thatwill bring us to the plateau where the temple is …’‘But what if it isn’t the right place?’ I asked plaintively.Shaun Arrigo clasped his mask and regulator to his face, jumped overboard anddisappeared silently beneath the waves.BIRD’S-EYE VIEW … (6)MALTA, 24 JUNE 2001The helicopter passes above Dingli now, where the golfball domes of a modernradar station overtop the steep cliffs. Then we come to a sloping area ofexposed limestone between Buskett Gardens and the sea. Approximately 2kilometres square, it is incised with a tremendous network of curving paralleltracks – one of the few surviving tableaux of Malta’s famous ‘cart-ruts’.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn26]I have walked here several times during previous visits in 1999 and 2000 andknow that the ruts are often sheer-sided, sometimes a metre or more deep and upto two hands-breadths wide at the base. Nicknamed locally ‘Clapham Junction’,the area is preserved as a tourist attraction today. And as we hover 120 metresabove it – I can see that it does indeed resemble a junction point wheremultiple railway lines converge and diverge. Some of the pairs of tracks runstraight; some curve; some cross over one another. But there is no particularsense of organization or pattern – which is one among many reasons why nouniversally accepted explanation of this peculiarly Maltese phenomenon has everbeen given.27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn27] Archaeologistsdon’t even have a clue how old the ‘ruts’ are, although it is certain that thoseat Clapham Junction were already in place 3000 years ago when datable Punictombs were cut through a number of them.28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn28] It is certain, too, that theywere not simply worn away in the tough limestone by the passage of cart-wheelsover periods of centuries, as many have wrongly theorized; on the contrary,there is no proof whatsoever that cart-wheels ever ran in these ruts – whichwere initially carved or cut out of the bedrock with the use of tools.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn29] Some archaeologists associatethem with the megalithic temples;30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn30] others believe that they datefrom the Bronze Age, between 4000 and 3000 years ago after the culture of thetemple-builders had collapsed.31 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn31]The truth is nobody really knows anything at all about what they are, or whomade them, or when, or why.As with so much in Maltese prehistory their origins may belong in an underworldthat scholars do not seem anxious to explore. However the existence – to whichwe can now attest with photographs and film – of ‘cart-ruts’ on a gigantic scaleunderwater at Marfa Point raises the possibility that this phenomenon may havemuch older origins that any scholar has previously suspected.HUBERTWORLD … (6)MALTA, 15 NOVEMBER 1999I jumped immediately after Shaun Arrigo but he was already far below me and ittook me a moment or two of hard finning to catch up with him. Contrary to theindications of the echo-sounder – unless we had already been carried far fromour entry point by what was proving to be quite a brisk current – the bottomhere was deeper than 25–30 metres. In fact, as we continued to sink, it becameclear that it was deeper than 40 metres …Arrigo was a strong swimmer and I found it hard to keep up with him, but weforged ahead against the current until we did finally encounter a reef ofbedrock gradually sloping up from 30 metres or so through 28 metres, then 24metres, before levelling off into what seemed to be a vast submarine plaincovered with undulating fronds of seagrass, at about 22 metres. Because of thestormy overhead light, visibility at this depth was poor – like diving at dusk –and even if the plain did lead to an eminence at some point it was obvious thatwe would only stumble across it by chance.Besides, we had been down for quite a while now, quite deep – 38 metres at theoutset, then a long hard swim for twenty minutes or so at between 30 and 22metres. I checked my air pressure gauge and found, as I had expected afterburning so much energy, that I was already below 100 bar on what was only amoderate-sized 12 litre tank. Another 50 bar – definitely less than twentyminutes at this rate unless we got into shallower water – and I was going tohave to ascend, allowing enough air for at least a five-minute rest-stop (andpreferably a bit more) at 5 metres. Arrigo seemed to be making a personalstatement of some sort by staying ahead of me in the water at all times so Icouldn’t see his guage. But I could be reasonably sure that his air consumptionwould be better than mine, since he was twenty years my junior and dived for aliving.We swam on for a while at 22 metres, still against the current, then I caught upwith Arrigo with another titanic effort, grabbed one of his fins to get hisattention, showed him my guage – now down to 70 bar – and signed that I wasgoing to start doing this dive in shallower water.He indicated that he preferred to stay deep for a bit longer – making the‘search’ signal as he did so.Hmm … Interesting …Very slowly, remaining parallel with Arrigo but now above him, I began toascend.I realized that I was exhausted, almost gasping for breath as though the windhad been knocked out of me, but my ego would not allow me to show it or make anysign of distress. So I tried to relax, calm my breathing, reduce my heart-rate.Like other bad, fruitless dives that I had done, I told myself, I was going toget through this one.I did the rest-stop and had 50 bar left when I reached the surface – all fineand orderly. No panic. The only problem, as I looked around from the peaks andvalleys of the billowing waves upon which I now bobbed like a cork with my BCDfully inflated, was that there seemed to be no sign at all of the lutzu.I couldn’t see it anywhere. It had gone.Moments later, blowing like a seal, Arrigo joined me from the depths with 70 baron his gauge. So at least I would have someone to talk to while I waited todrown or die of exposure.BIRD’S-EYE VIEW … (7)MALTA, 24 JUNE 2001We’re still hovering over Clapham Junction while Colin Clark, the Channel 4cameraman, and Santha with her Nikons continue to occupy the open door andwindow, trying to get clean shots of the cart-ruts to compare with what we haveseen underwater at Marfa Point.The complicated question of which parts of the island are rising and which aresinking because of activity along the Pantalleria Rift must, of course, befactored into the equation along with sea-level changes – but theoretically itought to be possible to calculate a fairly accurate date for the submergence ofthe Marfa Point ‘ruts’. That would then give us a terminus ante quern for thecutting of the ruts by human beings – i.e., we could be sure that the ruts hadbeen cut before the date of their submergence and must therefore be at leastthat old.Interestingly, Anton Mifsud’s tireless research in the archives has unearthed anobscure account published in 1842 of the travels in Malta of a certain Dr J.Davy, whoobserved cart ruts between Marfa and Wied il-Qammieh in northwest Malta, andfrom their interrupted nature at the edge of the cliffs, inevitably concludedthat the Maltese islands had once been significantly larger during the presenceof man in Malta.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn32]Now it may well be that the submerged ruts we’ve dived on off Marfa Point willultimately prove to pose no problem to orthodox chronology. That is perfectlypossible if land subsidence has been the major factor in their inundation. Buteven so, they should be seen in context of the wider phenomenon of submergedruts – contiguous to many different stretches of the Maltese coast – which havebeen reported in the past. Indeed, Anton Mifsud demonstrates that ‘before theirgradual disappearance over the past few decades’ the ruts were ‘repeatedly andvalidly associated’ by scholars and travellers with a former extension ofMalta’s landmass.33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn33] ‘In severalmaritime sites around the island of Malta,’ wrote Sanzio in 1776, ‘one could seedeep cart ruts in the rock that extended for long distances into the sea.’34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn34] And in 1804 De Boisgelinbelieved he had found evidence that:Some serious disruptions and subsidings have taken place on the island … Anextraordinary subsidence … must have occurred on the coast not far from thepleasure grounds of Boschetto [Buskett] … on the southern side of which vestigesof wheels have cut into the rock, and may be traced to the sea … and the rutsmay be perceived underwater at a great distance, and to a great depth; indeed asfar as the eye can possibly distinguish anything through the waves …35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn35]Father Emmanuel Magri, the first official excavator of the Hypogeum at HalSaflieni, recorded the presence up until the end of the nineteenth century ofcart-ruts on the tiny uninhabited island of Filfla36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn36] – which lies some 5 kilometressouth of the twinned megalithic temples of Mnajdra and Hagar Qim in the samegeneral area of Malta’s south coast. And in 1912, R. N. Bradley commented oncart ruts near Hagar Qim – noting that they ran ‘over the precipitous edge ofthe cliff towards Filfla’.37 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn37] Insubsequent years the ruts in both places have been completely obliterated (inthe case of Filfla by sustained naval bombardments – the island was for a longwhile a favoured spot for target-practice). Nevertheless, as Mifsud observes,the combined effect of Magri’s and Bradley’s testimony is to suggest thatcart-ruts once ran all the way from Hagar Qim to Filfla passing across aland-bridge that has therefore been submerged since human beings first came tothe islands.38 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn38]In what he would be the first to admit is an untested hypothesis, Mifsudproposes a cataclysmic collapse of the Malta-Filfla land-bridge as a result ofrifting processes in relatively recent prehistory – just over 4000 years ago –and he links this hypothetical cataclysm with the seemingly abrupt demise of thetemple-building civilization of Malta around 2200 BC.39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn39]We have finished our work at Clapham Junction and the helicopter is now runningeast at 150 metres along Malta’s south coast between Ghar Lapsi and the BlueGrotto. To our left, nestled into the slope of the island, is the colossaledifice of Mnajdra and above it on the hilltop stands Hagar Qim. To our right,across the open waters of the Mediterranean, is Filfla.No diving is presently allowed around Filfla, and the entire area has beendesignated a closed nature reserve. But I can’t help wondering – what liesbeneath those waters other than unspent ordnance from the years of bombardment?Could there be the remains of a lost civilization there? Perhaps on the sea-bedbetween Hagar Qim and Filfla – as on the sea-bed off the Qawra and Marfa Pointsand off Sliema too – some of the mysterious antecedents of Malta’s extraordinarytemple-building culture are waiting to be found?HUBERTWORLD … (7)MALTA,15 NOVEMBER 1999The lutzu was there after all, but it had drifted far away. It was obvious,since we could hardly see it, that Santha and the others on board certainlycould not see us, especially when the swell carried us down – as it often did –into deep troughs in the waves. I knew that Santha would be beginning to beconcerned by now, although she might not be expecting us to surface for someminutes yet if she had been assuming a shallower dive than we had in fact made.Time passed and the sea was getting higher. Arrigo and I bobbed a few metresapart, beginning to feel cold, not talking because that required energy.Although my BCD was fully inflated, I found that I was constantly inhalingsea-water as waves splashed into my face or rolled me momentarily under. At thesame time I found myself reluctant to take air through my regulator from themiserable 50 bar or less that was left in my tank; I might need that for a realemergency.We tried waving – futile, of course in waves so high. We tried blowing thepathetic little whistles that manufacturers attach to BCDs and that cannot beheard at 5 metres if there’s a wind blowing. There was a wind blowing.Then Arrigo connected up a power-whistle that had been concealed in an emergencykit somewhere on his person to the inflator hose on his BCD and pressed thebutton. For two seconds the air was filled with an ear-splitting howl that couldhave been heard on the other side of the island. Then the noise suddenlystopped.Arrigo cursed: ‘Not enough pressure. It’s supposed to work down to 50 bar.’There was no sign of the distant lutzu charging course. If they had heard us ithad not been long enough to get a bearing.‘But you’ve got 70 bar,’ I pointed out.Arrigo shook his head. ‘Don’t think so. Maybe a faulty guage. How much do youhave?’‘Less than 50 bar.’‘Shit! Still, give it a try and see what happens.’I took the whistle from him, connected it to my inflator hose, pressed thebutton. Nothing.‘Shit.’We decided that we had better start swimming towards the shore, which by nowseemed tremendously far away – had a current been carrying us out to sea allalong? After ten minutes of effortful paddling, however, it became obvious thatwe had made no forward progress at all.I floated on my back to catch my breath and, on the off-chance, decided to trythe power whistle again. This time it worked at full blast and I kept the buttonpressed for several seconds, joyously observing as I did so that this time thelutzu was turning towards us. For a moment the whistle stopped, then startedagain, and I got three more good blasts out of it before it packed upcompletely. But the emergency was over. We’d been spotted and, after somemanoeuvrings, were recovered into the lutzu from the increasingly wild sea.Back on board, still in my wetsuit and drinking hot tea, I did not realize howclose our escape had really been until I saw the massive Valletta-to-Gozocar-ferry bearing down relentlessly on our last position in the water before therecovery.We had been snatched out of its path with just a few minutes to spare.BIRD’S-EYE VIEW … (8)MALTA, 24 JUNE 2001After the helicopter has made the run over the Ice Age valley long sinceinundated by the waters of the Mediterranean that once plunged between the twohigh points of Hagar Qim and Filfla, we circle back to take a closer look atHagar Qim and at its ‘paired’ temple Mnajdra.In total the remains of twenty-three megalithic structures classified byarchaeologists as temples have been found in Malta – of which, according to DrDavid Trump’s authoritative Archaeological Guide,six stand alone, ten are in pairs, and there is one group of three and one offour. Five more structures of similar type have irregular plans, and there areat least twenty scatters of megalithic blocks … which could represent the lastvestiges of former temples … It is on the whole unlikely that many more remainto be discovered. The number destroyed without trace we shall never know.40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn40]All the temples were supposedly built between 3600 and 2500 BC,41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn41] with the bulk of the workcompleted before 3200 BC.42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn42] Thebest known on the tourist circuit today are Gigantija on Gozo, and Tarxien,Hagar Qim and Mnajdra on Malta. Other important temples, though smaller and lessoften visited, include Mgarr and Skorba, Tal Qadi and Bugibba. In a peculiarlyMaltese compromise, the latter, near our dive site at Qawra Point, has beenengulfed and partially ingested by the modern Dolmen Hotel.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn43]The pilot holds the helicopter stationary over Hagar Qim, giving us a bird’s-eyeview of its impressive perimeter megaliths, which include one 7 metres high thatis estimated to weigh more 20 tonnes.44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn44] As at Gigantija the shape of thetemple is defined by graceful curves and re-entrants and it contains a series ofpaired apsidal rooms, also lined with megaliths. From above, the ovalarrangement of the apses make them seem almost like enormous eggs lying in ahuge stone nest and I am struck again by the strangeness and uniqueness of thisdesign and by the odd fact, pointed out with some bemusement by David Trump,that ‘There is nothing looking remotely like one of these temples outside theMaltese Islands.’45 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-ftn45]We circle several times, then bank downhill towards the coast where Mnajdra lies– the last stop on our magical mystery tour. Although it is a spaciousconglomerate of three temples (the ‘Small Temple’, the ‘Middle Temple’ and the‘Lower Temple’), Mnajdra can at first sight seem almost inconsequential, tuckedaway as it is in rugged terrain against a hillside. The lower temple and themiddle temple each have four of the characteristic megalithic apses arranged intwo opposed pairs. The small temple is ‘trefoil’ in plan – with three apsesarranged like a three-leafed clover.I remember how, a year previously – on 20 June 2000 – I’d watched the summersolstice sunrise from within the lower temple at Mnajdra courtesy of ReubenGrima. It was then as the rays of the sun were projected on to a great megalithflanking the south side of the central axis that I understood for the first timehow subtle and pure, how understated and yet how purposive, was thearchitectural genius of its builders. These people, who could achieve the mostprecise and painstaking alignments in the medium of cumbersome and giganticstone, had not only been master architects and engineers – and first-classobservational astronomers – but also excellent practical mathematicians andgeometers. And all of this, presumably, had been harnessed to something else,some greater or transcendant objective that was somehow expressed in thetemples.Our hour is nearly up. The pilot banks away from Mnajdra and we head backtowards the airport. In the last few minutes of the flight I find myselfreturning to the basic conundrum that has exercised my imagination in Maltasince 1999, when I first involved myself here. It’s the absence of background tothe temples, the fact that they’re suddenly just there, almost ready-made –without any obvious antecedents. And the fact that ancient megalithic orrock-hewn structures appear to exist underwater at several points around thearchipelago -suggesting an older episode of construction that prehistorians havenot yet taken account of.Despite archaeological and C-14 evidence to the contrary, the existence of whichI freely acknowledge, I think the time has come to consider the possibility thatthe origins of Malta’s megalithic temples and its mysterious Hypogeum might notbe confined exclusively to the fourth millennium BC, as we have hitherto beentaught, and that these amazing structures might have far older and far moremysterious roots."},{"pageContent":"16 / CAVE OF BONESTo sleep within the Goddess’s womb was to die and to come to life anew.Marija GimbutasThere are places in the world made by people gone before us – hallowed places,places of power – in which the art and architecture serve as mantras that dilatethe spirit. In some cases it is possible to trace back a sacred history of thesite that long predates any surviving structures and symbolism there –suggesting that we may be in the presence of something numinous in the locationitself to which human beings of all epochs and faiths can respond.Without any intention of giving an inclusive list I might mention ChartresCathedral and the prehistoric painted caves of Lascaux and Chauvet in France,Altamira in Spain, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the Temple of Seti I andthe Osireion at Abydos in Upper Egypt, the Great Pyramid of Giza in Lower Egypt,the Bayon at the heart of Angkor Thorn in Cambodia, the Temple of Apollo atDelphi in Greece, the rock shrines of Mount Miwa in Japan, Machu Picchu in Peru,Stonehenge in England …And the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni in Malta.Imagine yourself at the entrance to an underground labyrinth with a footprint ofhalf a square kilometre in the horizontal dimension measured out across threeirregularly shaped levels stacked on top of one another in the verticaldimension – and the whole plunged in sepulchral darkness. This labyrinth,descending into the bowels of the earth, is the Hypogeum. It is thought byarchaeologists to have been created earlier than 3000 BC. Some have speculatedthat its hive of interconnected chambers may first have begun to take shapenaturally millions of years ago as solution cavities in the bedrock which werelater expanded and reshaped by man. But the late J. D. Evans, formerly Professorof Prehistoric Archaeology at the University of London and a great authority onMalta, argues that the Hypogeum was entirely man-made from top to bottom andfrom the very beginning of the enterprise. Evans points out that even thecrudest, most cave-like chambers exhibit certain features, ‘such as the cleveruse of natural faults in the soft rock to provide ready-made walls and ceilings’that ‘point to a human rather than a natural origin’.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn1]There is controversy about the Hypogeum, as we shall see. But one matter aboutwhich there has been no disagreement is that the people who carved it out werethe same people who built the great megalithic temples like Gigantija and HagarQim above ground on the Maltese islands. Even the general architectural style ofthe rock-hewn features within the Hypogeum self-evidently belongs to the same‘school’ as the free-standing temples. Indeed, fragments of pottery from almostall the recognized phases of the temple-building period -and even from before itin the so-called Zebbug phase thought to date back to 4000 BC have beenexcavated from within the Hypogeum.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn2][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_078_r1.jpg]Hypogeum floorplan and cross-section. Based on Evans (1971).But next to nothing is known about the temple-builders themselves. We do notknow what language they spoke. They have left us no script to decipher thatmight shed light on their rituals, customs, history and beliefs. There are norecords elsewhere in the world from so ancient a period that refer to them. Sotheir extraordinary works of art and stone that have endured the passage of theages are now the only means we have to access all that is most interesting aboutthem – in other words, their religious and philosophical ideas and the level ofintellectual development of their culture.The spaces within the Hypogeum, like the clover-leaf lobes of the megalithictemples, feel womb-like rather than strictly ‘architectural’.Some of the chambers were washed from top to bottom in red ochre, enhancing theorganic effect.Others were gracefully painted with spirals, disks, volutes, honeycomb-patterns,animal figures, hand-prints and ideograms – the majority in red ochre, a few inblack manganese dioxide pigment.Here a cavernous circular hall was hewn out of the bedrock.There a ‘window’ was cut at eye-level into the wall of a passage and then anarea beyond was hollowed out with infinite care to create an ovoid cist aboutthe height of a man that can only be accessed through the window.A few paces to the west along the same wall, an elliptical hollow a metre deepwas carved. It eerily amplifies low-pitched voice tones while absorbing highernotes like a sponge.Over here a graceful gallery was hewn.Over there the rough, blank face of the bedrock was first chiselled into asweeping curve, then carved and penetrated to create a lintelled megalithicgateway leading to further galleries beyond.The lintel was painted with a pattern of twelve disks in red ochre.Above, ceilings were cut here so lofty that they recede from view and there solow that you must stoop to pass beneath them.Below, the floor was left rough in places, chiselled smooth in others,treacherous curbs and drops were created, and a stairway descending into thelowest depths was left hanging in mid-air after six steps down with a straightfall of 2 metres below it.Altogether thirty-three major ‘rooms’ have been defined within the labyrinth. Ofthese eight are on the upper level, nineteen on the middle level and six on thelowest level. Some of the rooms have as many as four subsidiary chambersbranching off them and multiple entrances and exits connecting to the widernetwork weaving through the entire edifice.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn3]The result, in the end, as we may still experience it, is a surreal underworldof stairways and chambers, galleries, pits, and tunnels interconnected withsinuous passages and shafts – like a game of three-dimensional snakes andladders.‘NO SPECIAL IMPORTANCE WAS ATTACHED TO IT …’I have explored the Hypogeum twice.The first time was in June 2000 when it had been closed to the public for almosta decade (as with my entry to Mnajdra at dawn on the summer solstice in the sameyear, this private visit was arranged at short notice, courtesy of Reuben Grimaof the National Museum).My second opportunity came when I was in Malta in June 2001 with the Channel 4film crew. Although the Hypogeum had been reopened by then, we were allowed towork in it out of hours under the benign supervision of Joe Farrugia, thecurator.There is ambiguous evidence that someone, or several people, might have enteredsome parts of the Hypogeum in the nineteenth century, and possibly even earlierin the seventeenth century,4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn4] butthe official story today is that it was discovered in 1902 after being sealedoff for millennia. Two blocks of houses were being built on the land immediatelyabove it in the township of Paola. Bell-shaped water-tanks cut out of thebedrock were a standard feature of Maltese homes of the period and the discoverywas made by construction workers cutting one such tank. They broke through intoa rock-hewn chamber below the cistern and from there were able to enter ‘themain halls of the monument’.5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn5]Subsequently other parts of the Hypogeum were also exposed as more cisterns werecut:The builder did not report his discovery to the authorities immediately, butused the underground chambers as handy dumping grounds for stones and debris tosave himself the trouble of carting away the useless material. When the houseswere ready the owners in a casual way informed some Government officials of theexistence of the Hypogeum. The place was visited, but being full of rubbish andswamped with water no special importance was at first attached to it. TheGovernment, however, appointed a Committee to report on the discovery, and in1903 the place became Public Property.6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn6]THE DOCTOR AND THE JESUITThe first scholar to visit the Hypogeum was the eminent Maltese medical man andpolymath, Dr A. A. Caruana, who spent 29 December 1902 there at the request ofthe British authorities.7 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn7] Caruanawas not able to excavate, merely inspect, but he commented particularly on arather macabre sight. The lowest level of the underground labyrinth proved tocontain ‘a great quantity of human skulls and bones … heaped over each other andat random’.8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn8]In 1903 official excavations started under the supervision of Father EmmanuelMagri, a Jesuit priest and one of the members of the management committee of theValletta Museum. Magri began by sinking a shaft deep into the rock to create themodern entrance to the Hypogeum in its middle level. All the rubbish left behindby the builders was then removed via this shaft. After that followed tonnes of‘dark dank earth’ that seemed to have been deposited throughout the structure atsome time in antiquity. According to contemporary observers, this deposit wasuniformly ‘full of fragments of bones, pottery and other small objects’.9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn9] The pottery and small objectswere saved; the bones were placed in a heap for daily disposal by the worksforeman and never heard of again.10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn10] Thus began a story of neglect,muddles and bizarre losses of prime archaeological evidence from the Hypogeum –a story that continues to the present day.Soon after clearing the central chambers, Magri was called away by the Jesuitsto save souls abroad and died suddenly at Sfax in Tunisia in 1907. He had notyet published any report on his work in the Hypogeum and the notebooks that hewas known to have kept in which he had recorded the details of his excavationsmysteriously disappeared after his death.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn11] Perhaps the Jesuits have them.The consequence at any rate, as David Trump admits, is that though most of theobjects and pottery excavated by Magri have been preserved, ‘no record of theircontext or associations survives’.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn12] Since full details of provenanceare essential if an informed archaeological judgement is to be made, or achronological sequence proposed, the value of the finds is thus greatly reduced.THE GODFATHERAfter Magri came Themistocles (later Sir Temi) Zammit, the renowned ‘godfatherof Maltese archaeology’, who was at this time Curator of the Valletta Museum.His careful and systematic excavations at the Hypogeum removed the remainingdeposits uncleared by Magri, including the bone-filled earthy mass in the loweststorey which Caruana had noticed in 1902. The nature of this mass was describedat some length by Zammit in the official report of his excavations published in1910:A dark compact deposit was found which showed nowhere signs of having beendisturbed. In this old deposit no stratification was observed and in caves whichwere cleared inch by inch, the deposit was always of the same type and containedobjects of the same quality. The deposit of the large caves, about a metre indepth, was made of the red earth one finds in our fields and in this, bones andpotsherds were intimately mixed … disjointed and confusedly massed … Very fewbodies were found lying in a natural position and no special arrangements suchas trenches, sepulchres, stone enclosures etc., were met with, anywhere,intended to receive a body.13 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn13]For example in one cave:Not a single [skeleton] was found lying with bones in position … At least 120skeletons were buried in a space of 3.17 by 1.2 by 1 m. This is enough to showthat a regular interment was out of the question as not more than 12 bodiescould be laid in such a limited space.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn14]In a separate publication in 1912, coauthored with T. E. Peet and R. N. Bradley,Zammit confirmed that:No complete skeletons came to light, and the bones lay in confusion through thesoil as in the rest of the Hypogeum, except that occasionally an arm withfingers, and a complete foot, and several vertebrae would be found lying withthe parts in situ. From the upright position of an isolated radius it might bejudged that the filling up of the cave was of a wholesale nature, rather thanthat individual burials took place in it … unrelated bones and also implementswere found in the interior of skulls … Animal bones were found mingled withhuman.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn15]Altogether, Zammit calculated, the skeletons of somewhere between 6000 and 7000individuals lay tangled and mashed up together within the Hypogeum.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn16] One of his students, W. A.Griffiths, who wrote a report on the excavations in National Geographic magazinein 1920, put a higher figure on the record:Most of the rooms were found to be half filled with earth, human bones andbroken pottery. It has been estimated that the ruins contained the bones of33,000 persons … Practically all were found in the greatest disorder …17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn17]Let’s assume Griffiths’ figure, not repeated elsewhere in the literature, is amistake and stick with the lower total of 6000 to 7000 individuals. What werethey doing there? And how (other than with howls of outrage and disbelief) arewe to receive the official admission, already reported in chapter 15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c15_r1.htm#c15], that almost none of this vast horde ofprehistoric bones has been preserved? Professor J. D. Evans was by no meansoverstating the gravity of the matter when he described the disappearance of theremains as ‘an irreparable loss to Maltese archaeology’.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn18] And that was in 1971 when theNational Museum still had eleven of the Hypogeum skulls in its possession.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn19] By 2001, as we’ve seen, only sixwere left.TRAVEL PLANSJUNE 2000I first went to Malta in November 1999 because of the rumours of an underwatertemple off Sliema reported in chapter 15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c15_r1.htm#c15]. My dives that November were arduousand unproductive. But I kept an open mind and determined that I would return thefollowing summer in better weather. I rarely plan things far in advance, but itwas obvious that we should be there in June, and very specifically around 21June – the summer solstice – in order to see the wondrous light effect,contrived by the ancients, that occurs at sunrise at the megalithic temple ofMnajdra. At least that was a sure thing, and worth making the journey for in itsown right, even if the diving turned out, as I feared it would, to be a bust forthe second time running.Since solstice alignments usually work equally well on 20, 21 and 22 June (thesun’s rising point in the east and setting point in the west hardly change atall during the entire three days), Santha and I scheduled to be at Mnajdra onthe 20th and then to fly on to Tenerife in the Canary islands to observe somemore solar magic on the 21st – this time at sunset – that had been reported in agroup of mysterious pyramids in the little town of Guimar recently excavated bythe explorer Thor Heyerdahl. We would meet Heyerdahl at Guimar for the veryfirst shoot of my Channel 4 TV series on the 21st. Afterwards the film crewwould return to England but Santha and I would stay on in Tenerife for a fewdays to check out claims by local divers to have seen ‘strange things’underwater at several points around this volcanic Atlantic island – including‘towers made of huge blocks of stone’ and a cross (also ‘huge’) formed by twostraight channels intersecting at right angles and seemingly carved into a lavaflow on the sea-bed at 27 metres.From Tenerife the final leg of our June 2000 journey, now spilling into July,would take us to Alexandria in Egypt. There, as reported in chapter 1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01], we had arranged to meet Ashraf Bechaifor 10 days of diving to see if we could relocate the parallel walls of giantregular blocks that he remembered seeing years before underwater off Sidi Gaber.A TEMPLE, OR A TOMB … OR SOMETHING ELSE?What was the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni for? Presumably its makers must have had aspecific function in mind when they invested so much time, energy and humanlabour in its creation. But what?J. D. Evans, the most influential of the group of archaeologists who made theirnames in Malta during the second half of the twentieth century, is reticent onthis subject. Concluding a 15,000-word dissertation, which guides us throughevery room and corridor of the Hypogeum with all the verve, passion andoriginality of a refrigerator manual, he writes: ‘This completes the descriptionof the monument. A few words must now be said about its nature and purpose. Inlater years Sir Themistocles Zammit was of the opinion …’20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn20] We then get a summary ofZammit’s opinions. In 1910, notes Evans, the great man had believed that ‘theHypogeum was in part used as a sanctuary in which religious ceremonies wereconducted, and in part as a burial place in which the bones of the dead weredeposited after being deprived of the flesh’.21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn21] In later years, however, hewas of the opinion that it was an underground temple, roughly analogous infunction to the stone-built ones above ground, though perhaps also used forspecial initiation rites, and that only at some later time was it used for theburial of the large number of people whose remains were found in it.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn22]And what of Evans’ own opinion, set down in his authoritative 1971 survey, ThePrehistoric Antiquities of the Maltese Islands: ‘In point of fact, there is nocogent reason against, and much evidence in favour of, the primary use of theHypogeum as a place of burial. It is its use as the locus of a cult which, ifanything, may be secondary …’?23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn23]He only momentarily allows himself to speculate, but when he does so he getsinteresting:Even admitting that a certain amount of cult activity must have gone on in theinner halls of the Hypogeum, the number of persons involved must have been verysmall. The Hypogeum was at no time a place of public worship, as the stonetemples seem to have been. Had it been so the smoke of the flares and torchesnecessary to provide adequate light must have stained and blackened the porouslimestone of the walls and ceilings, whereas in fact no traces of this can beseen. The Hypogeum was in all probability never fully illuminated in antiquity?its magnificently carved and painted halls were perhaps only half apprehended ina flickering and uncertain light by a few privileged or dedicated persons.24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn24]Dr David Trump, another of the acknowledged experts on Maltese prehistory,speculates that the Hypogeum ‘began as a simple rock-cut tomb [and] becameelaborated to include a funerary chapel at its heart’.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn25]Colin Renfrew, in Before Civilization, describes Hal Saflieni as ‘a greatcharnel house’ but also notes: ‘The main chamber has an imitation façade whichalmost certainly mimics the temples above the ground.’26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn26]So some sort of a combination between a tomb and a temple, with perhaps just asmidgeon of dimly lit cultic or initiatory behaviour grafted on, seems to be afair summary of the gamut of orthodox opinion as to the function of theHypogeum.THE GODDESS AND THE SLEEPING LADYZammit, Evans, Trump and Renfrew do represent orthodox opinion on this matter.They’re the heavy hitters. Centre Court at Wimbledon. In their league only thelate Marija Gimbutas, formerly Professor of European Archaeology at UCLA, takesa divergent approach – and even she does not question the basic, seeminglyobvious, assumptions that the Hypogeum was used as a burial place and thatrituals of some kind must have been performed within it as well. She likewiseaccepts, without examination, the orthodox chronology for the construction ofthe labyrinth (3600–2500 BC).27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn27]For these reasons, though radical, her view is not so divergent from themainstream position as it can sometimes appear. Rather, she works within thesame framework but places less emphasis in her analysis on burial at theHypogeum than on the cultic activities and initiation rituals that she believeswere also performed there.Gimbutas, who passed away in 2001, is one of the leading proponents of anintriguing hypothesis about who was who and what was what in prehistory. Itconcerns the distinctive carved and/or painted figures of enormously fat womenthat have been found in many European Neolithic sites (c.7000–4000 BC) and thealmost equally numerous and virtually identical examples going far back into theworld of Palaeolithic cave art (the Venus of Laussel, c.30,000 BC; the Venus ofLespugue, c.25,000 BC, etc.).28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn28]According to Gimbutas and others who have entered this fray, these figures arethe symbols and representations of an archetypal ‘Mother Goddess’ figure –simultaneously the Goddess of Fertility, the Goddess of Death and the Goddess ofRebirth – whose worship was ancient and must once have been extremelywidespread.29 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn29] Whether we findher painted, carved in relief out of the rock wall of a cave (as in thecelebrated example of Laussel), or in the form of a free-standing sculpture, theGoddess is usually represented as an imposing, hugely fat woman with danglingbreasts, egg-shaped buttocks and bulging calves and forearms. It is thereforenoteworthy that many figures exactly matching this description have beenexcavated from Malta’s megalithic temples, including two in repose – usuallyreferred to as ‘the Sleeping Ladies’ – that were found in the Hypogeum itself.‘The Hypogeum’, notes Gimbutas:with its rooms painted liberally with red ochre wash, represents the Goddess’sregenerative womb … An indication of the religious use of these womb-shapedchambers are the figurines of Sleeping Ladies lying stretched out on lowcouches, associated with two cubicles opening into the Main Hall. The morearticulate one, known as ‘The Sleeping Lady of the Hypogeum’, is a truemasterpiece. This generously rounded lady with egg-shaped buttocks lies on herside, asleep, almost visibly dreaming. Why is she sleeping in the tomb? Oneexplanation is that this represents a rite of initiation or incubation. To sleepwithin the Goddess’s womb was to die and to come to life anew. The Sleeping Ladycould also be a votive offering from one who successfully passed through therite of incubation in the Hypogeum …30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn30]I have stood before the Sleeping Lady of the Hypogeum many times. Her exactprovenance within the labyrinth is not as simple a matter as Gimbutas thinksbecause she was excavated by the ill-fated Father Magri. All we know, and thatis hearsay, is that she was found in a ‘deep pit of one of the painted rooms’.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn31] These days she occupies a glasscase mounted on a slender plinth in a cubicle at the rear of the NationalArchaeological Museum in Valletta. The cubicle is dimly lit and the tiny clayfigure, just 12 centimetres long, seems to float in space, sleeping if she issleeping, dreaming if she is dreaming …But can anyone really claim to know what was in the mind of the prehistoricsculptor who moulded her from clay, arranged the pleats of her figure-huggingmidi-skirt over her ample thighs, and positioned her in lifelike repose upon anoval couch with her right hand wedged under her ear for a pillow and her leftarm draped forward, supported by her huge breasts?NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON’TMALTA, 6–20 JUNE 2000During the two weeks we were in Malta before the June 2000 solstice we devotedan intensive week to diving. A Maltese friend, George Debono, supplied the boat– a small, comfortable cabin cruiser that is his pride and joy – and he, his sonChris and his sister Amy spent days with us tracking back and forth on thethankfully calm seas off Sliema. Dive support, tanks and refills were providedby Andrew Borg, a friend of George’s and a top-flight diver who worked with usuntiringly. We were lucky enough to have with us from Britain Tony Morse, aprofessional geologist and a PADI dive instructor in his own right. And HubertZeitlmair was on board as well, his confidence renewed each morning as we setout that that this would be the day on which we would relocate his missingunderwater temple.But we never did. We dived and dived and dived again yet we could not find it –as though it had dissolved in the sea or, like some magical castle, had thepower to appear and vanish, appear and vanish …In the Grail Castle Parsival fails to ask the right question and the Fisher Kingand his Knights and all the maidens of the procession, and the Holy Grailitself, and the castle too disappear without a trace. Was that what I did offSliema? Did I fail to ask the right question?I had certainly become over-focused on Zeitlmair’s notion that his temple was ona sea-mount 3 kilometres from shore. That, at any rate, is what I kept uslooking for, even though I remembered Shaun Arrigo insisting the previousNovember that the site he had filmed for Zeitlmair was not 3 kilometres out butjust 1. I would have liked to conduct a thorough search at both distances. Butthe problem was that I could only afford to devote a few days to speculativediving around Malta – a week at the most – and it made better sense toinvestigate one area well than two areas badly. So I had to gamble. Onekilometre or 3?I liked the level of conviction Zeitlmair radiated that the temple ruins stoodon a shallow spot surrounded by deep water and I felt reasonably confident thatsuch a place (with or without a temple on it) did exist off Sliema. Part of itwas the possible uncharted reef on the Royal Navy aerial photo that Zeitlmairhad shown me at our first meeting in the Diplomat hotel. And more provocatively,although it is difficult to judge distances accurately at sea, the very first ofmy November 1999 dives seemed to have been in exactly the right place on a reefwith exactly the right profile – which, unfortunately, I had not searchedproperly.So surely all we needed to do was find that reef a second time, which shouldn’tbe too difficult, I reasoned, since we’d already found it once – get its GPSbearings and then search it thoroughly from end to end until we came to thetemple.But neither the temple nor the uncharted reef wanted to be found twice – at anyrate obviously not by us. We abandoned the diving on the 14th. On the 15th I metJoseph Ellul and saw his original of Zeitlmair’s aerial photograph and thepress-clipping that he kept of Commander Scicluna’s modest 1994 report of havingfound a temple underwater off Sliema. And this shifted my perspective on thewhole problem. Because nowhere in Scicluna’s understated letter to the SundayTimes of Malta had he said what distance from the shore he had been diving atwhen, in his own words, he had located ‘a prehistoric temple … under 25 feet ofwater … at Sliema’ (see chapter 15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c15_r1.htm#c15]). Itwas Joseph Ellul’s lively mind that had put the two things together – on the onehand, Scicluna’s testimony and, on the other, the general location off Sliema ofthe ‘reef’ indicated in the aerial photograph – and it was Joseph Ellul who hadconcluded, not necessarily correctly, that the temple Scicluna had seen must belocated on that reef. Zeitlmair had then taken the inquiry to the next logicalstage by hiring the Arrigos to dive the site for him by proxy. And lo andbehold, when they had done so they had found and filmed something that lookedquite a lot like a temple.But the opportunities for miscommunication between Zeitlmair with his heavilyaccented German English and the Arrigos would have been legion and the wholebusiness of agreeing on the exact area in which to pursue the search would havebeen doubly complicated by Zeitlmair’s blindness. Now, over two seasons, I hadlooked where Zeitlmair had said I should look, and dived where he had said Ishould dive – pretty thoroughly, I should add – and had failed to find histemple.Was this because it wasn’t there? I would have thought so if it hadn’t been forScicluna’s letter. Or was it because we’d been looking in the wrong place? MaybeZeitlmair and I should have listened more carefully to Shaun Arrigo in November1999 when he’d insisted that the site was just a kilometre from shore.MORE FAT LADIESIf the Sleeping Lady is a form of the Goddess then it is probably significantthat two such figures were found in the Hypogeum while none have been foundelsewhere … But other ‘Fat Ladies’ – sitting down or standing up, sometimesminiature and sometimes carved on a fairly grand scale out of limestone – werefound by the excavators at all the major megalithic temples of Malta. Theoriginal of one of these sculptures, from Tarxien (a replica remains on site atthe temple) has been moved to the Museum and dominates the room next door to thetwo Sleeping Ladies. This obese figure is reckoned by Colin Renfrew to be ‘theearliest colossal statue in the world’.32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn32] David Trump believes that shemust surely, from her ‘size and position’, be ‘the Goddess herself’.33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn33]When complete she stood about 2.75 metres high, but time, weather and above allthe local farmers have reduced her to waist height … She wears a very fullpleated skirt. It would be ungentlemanly to quote her hip measurements, and hercalves are in proportion. She is supported, however, on small, elegant butseriously overworked feet.34 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn34]The section of the Museum overlooked by the Tarxien colossus is lined with longglass panels. Arranged behind these, like Bangkok prostitutes, a harem of FatLadies in varying stages of undress lounge and slouch – all of themdisconcertingly headless (although no significance should be placed on thissince the evidence suggests that the heads have simply been lost with thepassage of time).The group includes figures from the temple of Hagar Qim thought to date toaround 3000 BC retrieved from a strange cache, a time capsule, found ‘secretedunder an inner threshold step’.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn35] Of particular note are the socalled ‘Seated Goddess’ and the ‘Venus of Malta’. The former, 23.5 centimetreshigh,36 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn36] has luxuriouslycorpulent hips, buttocks and thighs; her ankles are crossed in front of her –crossing the legs would be impossible for a person so fat – and her bulging armsare folded. The Venus of Malta, 13 centimetres high and fashioned from clay,37[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn37] has been praised by manyobservers for its anatomical exactness and ‘startlingly realistic style’.38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn38] Again, the Mother Goddessattributes of huge breasts and thighs are unmissable.The remaining figures on display are summed up nicely by David Trump:Some are standing, naked or wearing only a pleated skirt, others also skirted,seated on some kind of stool, with legs to the front, yet others naked with thelegs tucked up to one side. One or both arms are usually across the chest, theother may hang at one side.39 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn39]ORIGINS IN THE PALAEOLITHIC?I have never visited any of the painted caves of Palaeolithic Europe – Lascaux,Chauvet, Laussel, Peche Merle, Lespugue, Altamira, Cosquer, and dozens upondozens of other sites – although I still hope, in this lifetime, to have theopportunity to do so. The majority are permanently closed to the public with nopossibility that they will ever be reopened and in some cases, as at Lascaux,there is even a long waiting list for access to the (apparently rather good)walk-through model that has been built near by. But I recoil at the idea oftouring a model and don’t think it is necessary to do so, or even to be an‘expert’ on the extraordinary artistic achievements recorded inside these caves,to recognize that the Venus figures found there – dating back as far as 30,000BC – do bear close comparison to the big-breasted, big-hipped Venuses of Malta,the ‘Fat Ladies’ represented again and again in the megalithic temples, and theSleeping Ladies of the supposedly Neolithic Hypogeum.My choice of the word ‘supposedly’ here is deliberate. The Hypogeum issupposedly – not definitely – a Neolithic structure.However, it has been assumed to be Neolithic since its discovery and has beenregarded as securely dated – to between 3600 and 2500 BC – since theintroduction of calibrated radiocarbon-dating more than a quarter of a centuryago.40 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn40] The habit of viewing itin the Neolithic time-frame is therefore deeply ingrained and not a singlescholar within the mainstream has considered the alternative possibility that issuggested by the Mother Goddess figures, the cave-like subterranean labyrinth,the use of red ochre and black manganese pigment – and many other curious andnotable features. This is the possibility that the Hypogeum, or parts of it, aswell as the ideas and symbolism it enshrines, might have been misdated to theNeolithic 5000 years ago – might in fact date back to the Palaeolithic more than10,000 years ago.It is thanks solely to the efforts of three determined Maltese scientists, allmedical doctors with a deep and abiding ‘amateur’ interest in prehistory, thatthis electrifying possibility, brushed under the carpet for a century, is todayon the agenda for serious discussion.Anton Mifsud is senior consultant in Paediatrics at Saint Luke’s Hospital,Malta, and President of the Prehistoric Society of Malta. His son, Simon Mifsud,is a senior registrar in Paediatrics at the Gozo General Hospital. CharlesSavona Ventura is a consultant in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Saint Luke’sHospital, Malta. Together and separately they have presented a devastatingcritique of the comfortable archaeological consensus, reported in the lastchapter, that the Maltese islands remained entirely uninhabited by human beingsuntil around 5200 BC.Recently, to their credit, some archaeologists have begun to pay attention andto do so publicly. Writing in 1999, for example, Anthony J. Frendo had this tosay:The earliest human inhabitants on these islands are currently thought to havecome here around the end of the sixth millennium BC during the Neolithic period.This quasi-dogmatic stance was severely put to the test when Anton and SimonMifsud claimed that this date had to be pushed back to a much earlier period,namely the Palaeolithic.41 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn41]After reviewing the detailed findings presented in their 1997 book Dossier MaltaFrendo concludes that the Mifsuds’ claim, though revolutionary, is in factcorrect and that their work has proved ‘beyond any reasonable doubt’ that humanbeings were present in Malta during the Palaeolithic as early as 15,000 to18,000 years ago and that ‘Malta’s history is thus extended backward by eightmillennia’.42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn42]REOPENING THE QUESTION OF TEMPLE ORIGINSAs Frendo is the Head of Department and Senior Lecturer in Archaeology at theUniversity of Malta, this is no lightweight endorsement. If it is supported byother archaeologists – and it becomes broadly accepted that there were indeedhumans on Malta after roughly 15,000 to 18,000 years ago – then the result,ultimately, can be nothing less than a complete rewrite of Maltese prehistory.In chapter 18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c18_r1.htm#c18] we will weigh up the hardempirical evidence that underwrites the Mifsuds’ case. Meanwhile, I doubtwhether archaeologists have yet properly understood the ramifications of theirprofession’s inevitable (and I suspect imminent) official adoption of the muchearlier date of first human habitation that the Mifsuds propose. At any rate, ifthey have understood, I see no sign of it in the literature other than Frendo’smonograph.For example, isn’t it obvious, once the presence of Palaeolithic humans in Maltais widely acknowledged, that this must force a radical revision of theperspective from which the Hypogeum and the megalithic temples like Gigantija,Hagar Qim and Mnajdra have traditionally been viewed? For even if furtherinvestigation reconfirms the conventional wisdom that these great structureswere indeed built in the Neolithic between 5600 and 4500 years ago, the proof ofa Palaeolithic presence in Malta must raise question-marks over the obviouslysophisticated and well-developed architectural heritage that all the templesincorporate and express from the outset. It would no longer be entirely safe, orlogical, to look exclusively outside Malta for the origins of the skills,knowledge and ideas invested in them – e.g. as part of the intellectual baggagecarried by the presumed first settlers (the so-called ‘Stentinello culture’,thought to have arrived from Sicily 7200 years ago).43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn43] On the contrary, an acceptedPalaeolithic presence would raise the possibility that the temple heritage wasnot an import from Sicily but was instead the product of very long in situdevelopment in Malta itself – perhaps in parts of Malta that have so far evadeddetailed archaeological scrutiny and particularly in areas that have beensubmerged by the sea.This is emphatically not to suggest that the wave of Neolithic settlement whicharchaeologists have detected in Malta around 7200 years ago did not occur –because it certainly did! It is to suggest instead a parallel hypothesis (myown, not the Mifsuds’, I hasten to add) that when Neolithic settlers firstentered Malta from Sicily 7200 years ago they may have encountered the remnantsof a much older, pre-existing culture which possessed and gradually passed onthe secrets of how to build and align the temples.Let’s not even dignify such wild speculation with the label ‘hypothesis’. Stillit seems to go some way towards resolving the paradox noticed by David Trumpthat ‘though building in stone was introduced to Malta by the first settlers …the use of huge blocks, so-called megalithic architecture, is not known beforethe temple period’.44 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-ftn44] Could thisbe because the stone-working culture of the ‘first settlers’ was fundamentallydifferent, and inferior, to an architectural tradition that already existed inMalta before their arrival and which was the true author and ancestor of theMaltese megalithic temples?"},{"pageContent":"17 / THE THORN IN THE FLESHWe amateur archaeologists do it for the love of it, and the excitement andadventure, whereas the so-called professionals are caught up in the ruts of theestablishment. Above all, they have no right at all to claim any monopoly ofinterpretation.Anton Mifsud, July 20011 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn1]Malta, 16 June 2000Anton Mifsud is in his early fifties, of medium build, olive-complexioned,heavily tanned, with a lot of experience and humour and a nice combination ofstrength, tolerance and intelligence in his face. He is exceptionallyopen-minded and lateral-thinking by nature – telling me once that he didn’tautomatically dismiss any idea, even if it seemed absurd. The point, he said,was to submit problems in history and prehistory to rigorous inquiry, find outthe facts about them and then draw the conclusions indicated by those facts.I first met Anton on 16 June 2000 when he signed my already much annotated copyof his explosive little book Dossier Malta. Just two days previously, on the14th, I’d concluded that I wasn’t going to throw any more money into diving offSliema. We’d looked, it hadn’t worked, the temple didn’t exist, and Malta didn’tlove me.Then on the 15th I met Joseph Ellul and read Commander Scicluna’s letter. So bythe 16th, when Anton Mifsud came to visit me at the seafront apartment Santhaand I had rented in Sliema, I was already more upbeat about the prospects of anunderwater discovery than I had been for several months. I’d also recentlyacquired and carefully read Dossier Malta and begun to digest the implicationsof Mifsud’s research, hitherto unknown outside Malta.Accompanying Anton that day was Charles Savona Ventura, with whom he hasco-authored several books. He’s a big bear of a man who looks like a Mexicanbandit and is a mine of information about Maltese prehistory.How, I found myself wondering, had these two obviously busy and successfulconsultants in hospital medical practice managed to keep their day jobs andlearn so much about the past as well? Because clearly they were not justinterfering ‘amateurs’ in the world of archaeology … You only had to listen tothem for two minutes to realize that they knew their stuff.MALTA: ECHOES OF PLATO’S ISLANDMALTA, 16 JUNE 2000As the conversation unfolded, Mifsud and Ventura got round to telling me aboutthe latest slice of provocative unorthodox prehistory they were working on-Malta: Echoes of Plato’s Island2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn2]– which would argue that Malta is a remnant of the lost island of Atlantis.‘You’re not going to like our date for the flood, though,’ said Mifsud, who hadread Fingerprints of the Gods, in which I first began to set out my case for alost civilization destroyed at the end of the Ice Age more than 12,000 years ago– a lost civilization of the Palaeolithic, in other words.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_079_r1.jpg]‘Why won’t Hike it?’On the one hand, Mifsud explained, he had strengthened and added to his evidencefor a human presence in Malta during the Palaeolithic in the three years sincethe publication of Dossier. On the other, however, his new research for Echoes(with Charles Savona Ventura and two other co-authors) had led him to adistinctly non-Palaeolithic date for the deluge that he believed had destroyed aformerly much larger Malta – the prehistoric Malta that was, in his scenario,the source of the Atlantis myth.Reduced to its barest essentials, Mifsud’s proposal is that a great land-bridgethat once joined Malta to Filfla collapsed cataclysmically through faulting ofthe submarine Pantelleria Rift at around 2200 BC.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn3] He links this event, which wouldhave generated massive tidal waves capable of flooding the entire archipelago,to the sudden demise of the temple-building culture that is well attested inMalta’s archaeological record at the end of the third millennium BC.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn4] And, in an elegant argument, hesuggests that it was this lost megalithic culture, and its overnight destructionby earthquakes and floods c.2200 BC, that was recorded in ancient Egyptianannals, passed on to the Greeks, and in later times remembered as ‘Atlantis’.5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn5] Mifsud points out that therelative chronologies for ancient Egypt and Atlantis given by Plato – with thelatter said to be a thousand years older than the former6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn6] – coincide with the relativechronologies for ancient Egypt and Malta (the former began to build withmegaliths in the Pyramid Age c.2600 BC; the latter began to build with megalithsa thousand years earlier at Gigantija, c.3600 BC).‘You’re quite right,’ I told Anton after I’d thought through his reasoning, ‘Idon’t like it at all.’As he looked at me expectantly, I raised my left hand and began to enumerate thecounter-arguments on my fingers.‘Firstly, there’s the issue of the relative chronology. To make your argumentwork – I mean about the megalithic civilization of Malta being a thousand yearsolder than the megalithic civilization of ancient Egypt – you have to buy intothe orthodox archaeological datings for both places. But you ought to be thefirst to know that orthodox archaeological datings may not always be correct. Inthe case of Egypt we have actual structures, such as the Sphinx and themegalithic temples beside it, which may be much older than the third millenniumBC7 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn7] – I’m sure you’re familiarwith the debate. There’s the megalithic stone circle at Nabta, 200 kilometreswest of Abu Simbel, which is at least 7000 years old.8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn8] And then there are the accountsof the ancient Egyptians themselves – the Abydos King List, the Turin Papyrusand so on – which trace the origins of their civilization back 30,000 years intothe past. Again, your relative chronology only works if you accept the orthodoxposition that all such accounts are baseless fictions – which I certainlydon’t.’Secondly, I continued, Anton’s argument involved not taking Plato seriously onthe epoch in which he had set the Atlantis events – supposedly 9000 years beforeSolon’s time, i.e., 9600 BC, i.e., about 11,600 years before the present, i.e.,the end of the Palaeolithic. And I could see no good reason not to take Platoseriously on that – indeed, he could have hardly set his global deluge(described as affecting both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic) in a moreflood-prone and cataclysmic epoch than the end of the Ice Age around 11,600years ago. To conclude that Plato had not meant 9000 years before Solon’s time(9600 BC) but 1600 years before Solon’s time (2200 BC) seemed to me arbitrary,to say the least.Thirdly, the notion inherent in Mifsud’s reasoning that Plato must have beenspeaking of the Mediterranean west of Malta when he referred to the ‘true ocean’leading to an opposite continent seemed to me to be highly suspect. I told AntonI was convinced that when Plato said this ocean was the Atlantic and placedAtlantis in it ‘opposite the Pillars of Hercules’ he knew exactly what and wherehe was talking about. So to my mind this on its own made Malta in the centralMediterranean an unlikely candidate for Plato’s island.But I hastened to add – and not just out of politeness – that none of this meantMifsud was necessarily wrong. I could be the one who was wrong. Atlantis hadbeen placed at other sites in the Mediterranean by other scholars – also atrelatively late dates.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn9] And ithad been placed almost everywhere else in the world from Indonesia to the SouthPole.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn10] I happened to be one ofthose who believed in taking Plato as literally as possible – if I was going totake him seriously at all – but I recognized the validity of other approaches.TERMINUS ANTE QUERNMALTA, 16 JUNE 2000Besides, there was no real contradiction between our positions – for the simplereason that we seemed to be talking about entirely different things. To state,as Anton did, that Malta underwent a flood/earthquake cataclysm about 4200 yearsago neither weakened nor strengthened my proposition that it would also havebeen subject to flood cataclysms – probably several times – during the meltdownof the last Ice Age between 17,000 and 7000 years ago. Likewise, Anton’s beliefthat a land-bridge between Filfla and south-west Malta collapsed through riftingprocesses 4200 years ago in no way contradicted the well-established fact thatMalta’s north-eastern coast was connected to Sicily by a 90 kilometreland-bridge before it was swallowed up by the rising seas at the end of the IceAge.Both periods are interesting for different reasons. But, I pointed out, Anton’sown research indicated that there had been human beings on Malta during theperiod of the great Ice Age floods at the end of the Palaeolithic. And althoughhe seemed to accept the orthodox radiocarbon ‘sequence’ and chronology for thetemples and the Hypogeum (of 3600 BC down to about 2200 BC), hadn’t he himselfalso written in Dossier Malta that:The terminus ante quern Carbon-14 dates given for these sites … are of beforesuch and such a year in the Neolithic; whether this period was a year or severalcenturies cannot be established by the Carbon-14 date alone. The most logicalexplanation is successive utilization of such sites initially by Palaeolithicand subsequently by Neolithic Maltese.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn11]And a few pages later:Since the megalithic temples have been assigned a terminus ante quern carbondate of before 3000 BC, nothing precludes that they were a carryover of atradition which had started in the Palaeolithic. Indeed the bas relief images ofbulls and a cow on the large blocks of stone lying just outside the Tarxientemple complex are themselves diagnostic features of Palaeolithic art.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn12]I could sense Mifsud’s reluctance as a rigorous scientist to get drawn into idlespeculation. But surely he was aware of the general direction in which hisarguments were tending? If he was saying that there had been humans on Malta inthe Palaeolithic, which he certainly was, and if he was suggesting that thesePalaeolithic humans had initiated the development of the megalithic temples,which, again, he certainly was, then weren’t the floods at the end of thePalaeolithic of at least as much potential significance to Maltese prehistory asthe floods and earthquakes that might also have occurred 4200 years ago?SKELETONS IN THE HYPOGEUMAnton Mifsud’s attack on the orthodox chronology and interpretation ofprehistoric Malta is made across several different fronts and sometimes producescontradictory data. This doesn’t seem to bother him. Once launched on aninquiry, he pursues the quest for data ruthlessly, as an end in itself, not tosupport particular arguments or positions.In the case of the Hypogeum, Mifsud’s approach, at first, was not directlyconcerned with chronology. Poring with the eye of a doctor over the earlyexcavation reports of Zammit, Bradley and others, he was puzzled by what theyhad to say about the state of the human remains found inside the labyrinth.In summary, as we’ve seen, all the excavators and all subsequent archaeologistspropose slightly different versions of the same theory that this great mass ofremains had been ritually buried in the earthy matrix that was found filling theHypogeum’s lower levels to a depth of about a metre when it was opened. Yet theinstinctive reactions that they set out in the original reports that Mifsud hadassembled, referred to in chapter 16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c16_r1.htm#c16],show that they were clearly startled, and in a few cases troubled, by thecomplete chaos and disorder in which the bones were found, commenting, forexample: ‘From the upright position of an isolated radius it might be judgedthat the filling up of the cave was of a wholesale nature.’13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn13] But how do we explain such a‘wholesale’ filling-up of the Hypogeum with the remains of thousands of humanbodies, all seemingly just dumped there ‘in a haphazard way’14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn14] with no anatomical disposition?Isn’t it a bit of a mystery?Not according to the archaeologists who say they’ve seen mass ‘catacomb-style’burials before in other parts of the world and on these islands – for example atBurmeghez, a natural cave in Malta,15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn15] and at the Borchtorff Circle onGozo, where rock-cut subterranean tombs encircle megaliths.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn16] So that makes this sort of‘funerary behaviour’ part of a pattern that legitimate experts in the subjectcan already claim to understand. None of them would deny that the Hypogeum’slabyrinthine character is utterly different from the rock-tomb character of theother sites, or that the bones it contained were indeed in such an extreme stateof disarrangement that any form of ‘regular interment was out of thequestion’.17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn17] But the problem caneasily be resolved within the prevailing ‘burial-place’ paradigm by proposingthat excarnation – i.e., the removal of the flesh from the bones – was practisedbefore interment and that the Hypogeum must therefore have been ‘a burial placein which the bodies were laid or heaped as skeletons’.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn18]Oh really? Heaped up and tossed about so casually? As Mifsud counters, theHypogeum cannot be legitimately compared to either of the two other significantsites of prehistoric mass burial in Malta:At Burmeghez there is a predominance of anatomical relationship between bodyparts, a left-sided flexed position of the body, an orientation along the mainaxis of the cave, and, by way of a lithic assembly, a stony arrangement [large,purposefully laid slabs] protecting the upper body parts …19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn19]Like at the Borchtorff Circle, all the burials are of an evidently (anduncontested) ritual nature and were disposed in two phases – a pair of rock-cuttombs with a shared central shaft dated to the Zebbug phase20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn20] (about 4000 BC-some centuriesbefore the supposed beginning of the temple period at Gigantija c.3600 BC), andfurther subterranean rock-cut tombs of the Tarxien phase arranged in anapproximate circle around a subterranean ‘megalithic assembly’.21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn21]In fact, the only site in Malta that Mifsud regards as comparable to theHypogeum of Hal Saflieni in general appearance – and that was found onexcavation to contain exactly the same sort of chaotic deposit – is the nearbyHypogeum of Santa Lucia (less than a kilometre away) that was excavated in theearly 1970s and has since been sealed up, presumably for ever – at least so theauthorities must intend – because it has been covered over by a moderncemetery.22 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn22]Mifsud describes the Santa Lucia Hypogeum as:a smaller version of that at Hal Saflieni, with a megalithic entrance and aninternal architecture similar to the temples above ground. The deposit insidethis hypogeum consisted of human remains admixed with Neolithic pottery andamulets, in a matrix of red earth soil; the context is similar to that at HalSaflieni. In the words of the Director of Museums at the time, the depositinside the Santa Lucia Hypogeum was ‘as if the mass had been dumped inside themonument from the surface’. F. S. Mallia could not have been more precise, andthe close proximity of the two hypogea enhances even further a similar mechanismoperating in both monuments in the creation of the deposit in question.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn23]Which brings us to the heart of the matter. Since Mifsud clearly does notbelieve that the carpets of disarranged human bones littered and dumped insidethe hypogea of Hal Saflieni and Santa Lucia arrived there as a result of burial,then what ‘mechanism’ does he think was operating?A FLOODLike other good ideas that no one has ever had before but that everybodyimmediately gets the point of once the secret is out, Mifsud’s explanation forthe mass of bones inside the Hypogeum is extremely simple:The accumulation of human remains at the Hypogeum in Hal Saflieni were notrelated to primary ritual burial, but were brought down into the Hypogeumlabyrinth through the action of floodwater in a matrix of red earth and soil.24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn24]The first and most obvious evidence for this novel hypothesis comes in themassively disordered nature of the remains described in the excavation reports.The presence of these disarticulated, non-anatomically disposed remains in anentirely ‘unstratified’ deposit ‘made of the red earth one finds in our fields’that was ‘always of the same type and contained objects of the same quality’,cannot in Mifsud’s view be explained by any form of deliberate burial – with orwithout prior excarnation. Only one agency, he argues, is capable of creatingsuch a conglomeration in an unstratified earth matrix in which ‘the same qualityof shards were found on the surface, at the bottom and in the space inbetween’,25 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn25] and in which‘fragments of shards in parts of the Hypogeum fitted other fragments depositedin other caves far away’.26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn26]That agency is a massive flood – and such events, from varying causes, have notonly been known to occur in the Maltese islands but also have left distincttraces of their passage in the form of animal and human bones, as well asassorted other materials, all muddled up together and evenly spread throughoutdeposits of silt or earth trapped inside caves or rock fissures. The classicexample is Ghar Dalam, an extensive natural limestone cave near Birzebbuga ineastern Malta, which contains six distinct layers of flood deposits swept intoits depths at different periods over the last 200,000 years. Exactly as in theHypogeum, notes Mifsud, the organic remains in Ghar Dalam ‘were not distributedin an anatomical manner as they would have been in a ritual burial, but theywere dispersed in random fashion inside the stratum of earth they lay in’.27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn27]What Mifsud is proposing in the case of the Hypogeum, therefore, is a one-off,one-time deluge that swept over the surrounding fields and habitations, andfinally over a great surface-level necropolis that then existed in the area,carrying away all its mouldering dead in one fell swoop and dumping theirskeletons and their grave goods, promiscuously mixed with fragments of pottery,the bones of large and small animals (including those of frogs and hedgehogs)28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn28] and a motley collection of otherobjects, into the nearest possible sinkhole – in this case the Hypogeum itself.Moreover, Mifsud believes that this was the same flood – caused by the collapseinto the sea of his proposed Filfla land-bridge and the resulting tsunami – thatbrought the temple-building culture of Malta, and all its activities within theHypogeum, to an abrupt and permanent halt c.2200 BC. Since carbon-dates fromMalta are as scarce as ice cubes in hell, as we shall see, it is interestingthat the first ever radiocarbon-dating of the Hypogeum’s few surviving humanremains – carried out in 1999 – does place them at the end of the Tarxien phase,c.2200 BC just as Mifsud argues.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn29] This new evidence from theHypogeum, he concludes, further strengthens ‘the feasibility of a suddencataclysm accounting for the sudden termination of the Tarxien people’.30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn30] And he points to the well-knownfact that the Tarxien temple itself was sealed at the end of the late Tarxienphase under a metre-deep layer of sterile silt.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn31] After several centuries ofabandonment a new culture then appeared – one that had nothing to do with thetemple-builders – and began building – on top of the silt layer.32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn32]OLD STONE AGEAlthough nobody in the world of archaeology seems to have noticed yet, the lateTarxien date (of between 2470 BC and 2140 BC)33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn33] for the Hypogeum’s human remainscontradicts the long-established convention, entered into dogma by J. D. Evans,that ‘the primary use of the Hypogeum [was] as a place of burial’. Since allarchaeologists accept that the construction of the labyrinth began significantlyearlier than 3000 BC, perhaps as early as 3600 BC (and since it even containedpottery of the Zebbug phase prior to 4000 BC), its ‘primary’ purpose can hardlyhave been to receive human remains that were not deposited in it until around2200 BC (whether or not one accepts that they were deposited there by flood). Itmust, therefore, have had some other quite distinct function at the time of itsorigin – a function that scholars may hitherto not have guessed, since noserious attempt has ever been made to investigate alternatives to the burialscenario.It may have been an underground version of a temple, of course – and its‘temple-like’ features have always been recognized – but if so, why is it such aunique and unusual temple? Why does it need all those winding corridors andlevels and cists secreted within rock walls, and spooky sound-effects andred-painted chambers, and falls and traps?Whatever its purpose – probably it will never be known fully, or known at all –certainty that the Hypogeum was not primarily designed as a central place ofburial for the dead of the temple-building culture as had hitherto been thoughtleft the way open for Mifsud to explore other possibilities about its functionand identity. And about its age. Because, as with the megalithic temples, sowith the rock-hewn labyrinth, the argument of terminus ante quern applies, andnothing rules out the possibility that the Hypogeum may be a ‘carryover of atradition which had started in the Palaeolithic – to quote again Mifsud’s ownwords, cited earlier. By the same token the flood that he believes swamped itwith bones and debris at around 2200 BC tells us nothing whatsoever about theorigins and antiquity of the structure itself – only that it was already thereto be flooded in 2200 BC (and certainly not how long it had existed beforethat).LONG BUT ULTIMATELY RELEVANT EXCURSION TO TWO POTENTIALLY UNPRONOUNCEABLETEMPLESMaltese is a lovely, lilting language to hear. Structurally it belongs to theSemitic family and is thus closely related to Arabic and Hebrew – indeed,Maltese friends tell me that their language and Arabic are often mutuallycomprehensible without need for interpretation. Modern Maltese also includesgreat numbers of Indo-European loan words that, for historical reasons, comemostly from Italian and English. Written Maltese uses the Latin alphabet but thepronunciation of the letters is often quite unusual in order to allow fullexpression of Semitic and uniquely Maltese cadences in speech. Thus Hagar Qim ispronounced something like Hajar-iim, Tarxien is Tarshien, Mgarr is Umjaar,Zebbug is Zebooj, and the potentially unpronounceable Mnajdra reaches the ear asa soft and mellifluous Munaidra.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_080_r1.jpg]Floorplan of Hagar Qim temple. Based on Evans (1971).About 8 kilometres south-west of the Hypogeum, but separated from one another byless than a kilometre, the temples of Mnajdra and Hagar Qim stand on Malta’ssouth coast, overlooking a spectacular panorama of deep blue sea andMediterranean sky in which the craggy little island of Filfla – blasted tosmithereens by centuries of artillery practice – floats like a mirage. By night,roofless (though thought to have been roofed in antiquity),34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn34] they gaze up at the wheelingconstellations and take an interest in the peregrinations of the moon. By daythey use a variety of shadows, peep-holes and cunningly contrived alignments tofollow and to record the path of the sun.Hagar Qim is the higher and northernmost of the twin temples. Occupying aflattened promontory of glaring white limestone, it is thought to have beenbuilt between 3500 and 3300 BC.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn35] As with other surviving sacredarchitecture of archaic Malta, it seems to abhor straight lines, seducing theeye with patterns of curves and waves. Its flowing perimeter, flung out in agreat irregular ellipse, is defined by a picket of enormous upright megaliths,deeply gnarled and weathered, some laid side-on, some face-on, some broken, somemissing, some restored. What seems like its primary entrance, framed by animposing trilithion, is on the south-eastern side of the structure in a gentlyconcave section of wall made of large, finely fitted blocks. On the north side,to the east of a second trilithion, a narrow, tapering monolith, like a chimneyor an obelisk, towers 7 metres tall; in the very top of it, only visible from ahelicopter or a crane, is a carved basin, function unknown.Inside the temple there are the usual clusters of lobed, egg-shaped roomsarranged in pairs – but I will not describe these further here other than torefer the reader to the relevant plans and photographs. With the notableexception of their astronomical and solar alignments, which were deliberatelyand precisely hard-wired into the architecture and from which certain deductionsmay legitimately be made, all ideas of function that have been proposed forthem, and for the rooms of Malta’s other temples, are entirely speculative. Forexample, we might say that this feature here is an ‘altar’, that that feature inthe wall over there is an ‘oracle hole’, while this one in the floor at our feetis a ‘libation hole’; that here the priests met in convocation; that therepublic gatherings were held … and so on and so forth. But it would all beguesswork, fantasy, invention. Since we don’t have the texts of the templebuilders, the truth is that we don’t know why they built the temples, or whythey built them with megaliths (rather than smaller, more manageable stones), orhow these structures were used, or even if they were ‘temples’ at all inanything like the traditional meaning of the word.Hagar Qim offers several alignments on the summer solstice. One, at dawn, is onthe north-east side of the structure, where the sun’s rays, passing through theso-called oracle hole, project the image of a disk, roughly the same size as theperceived disk of the moon, on to a stone slab on the gateway of the apsewithin. As the minutes pass the disk becomes a crescent, then elongates into anellipse, then elongates still further and finally sinks out of sight as thoughinto the ground. A second alignment occurs at sunset, on the north-west side ofthe temple, when the sun falls into a V-shaped notch on a distant ridge in linewith a foresight on the temple perimeter.I suspect in some way connected with astronomy is an object, unknown from anyother site in Malta, in Hagar Qim’s south-western apse. Described as ‘amysterious column altar’,36 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn36] itis a smoothly hewn white limestone pillar, almost circular in cross-section,with a circumference of about I metre and a height of 1.5 metres. The pillarstands upright within the curve at the south-western end of the apse – which hasbeen identified as an ‘inner sanctum’37[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn37] – so it seems to have beenaccorded a special significance.Were such an object to be found amidst the ruins of a south Indian temple itwould instantly be recognized as an ancient Sivalingam, the symbol and themanifestation of the god of knowledge, measurement and astronomy. But India isamong the few places in the world where a culture of vast antiquity is stillalive today. In Malta the thread connecting the present to the past is brokenand the voices and ideas of the temple-builders have not been heard formillennia …[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_081_r1.jpg]Floorplan of Mnajdra. Based on Evans (1971).Below the promontory on which Hagar Qim stands, the land falls away steeply in asouth-westerly direction towards Mnajdra and the sea. It is rough land, heavilyovergrown by wild thyme in the summer, with knolls and ridges of bedrock pokingeverywhere through the thin topsoil. These days, however, the walk down takesless than ten minutes on a concrete footpath installed by the Museums Department– which is in overall charge of the two sites.Mnajdra is not one temple but a complex of three. Of these the easternmost, withthree delicate apses disposed as a clover leaf, is the smallest and is believedto be the oldest – about 3600 BC, the same period as Gigantija. Archaeologiststhink that the westernmost, ‘lower’ temple was built next, around 3400 BC.Finally, at around 3200 BC, the middle – or ‘upper’ – temple was squashed inbetween its elder predecessors.38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn38]All are megalithic and all demonstrate a very high degree of architectural,engineering and mathematical competence on the part of the builders, but thelower temple is particularly imposing, with several courses of cyclopean masonrystill intact on top of enormous dressed boulders at ground level. It wasdescribed in 1993 as the ‘best preserved of all the Maltese temples’.39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn39] How long it can remain so isopen to question, since the Museums Department’s custody of the site has not yetrun to the provision of full-time night-watchmen. In consequence, in 1996 andagain in April 2001, Mnajdra was severely vandalized – at night – bywell-organized gangs of men armed with spray paint and sledgehammers. It beggarsbelief that this could have been allowed to happen – even once – on anarchaeological site of acknowledged global importance that is more than 5000years old. But for it to have happened twice?In such ways, either by accident or by design, Malta rends and devours her ownpast.This cannibal feast shows no sign of coming to an end, and, although themegalithic temples are strong and massive none of them can last for ever. Asnoted in chapter 15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c15_r1.htm#c15], the archaeologistDavid Trump recognizes twenty-three groups of ruins in the Maltese archipelagoas ‘classifiable temples’. But he also comments on the existence of at leasttwenty further ‘scatters of megalithic blocks … which could represent the lastvestiges of former temples’ and accepts that we can never know how many theremay once have been.40 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn40]So if the raw materials that the archaeologists have to work with in order tounderstand and date the temple-building culture have been so radicallyreduced-reduced almost by half from forty-three to just twenty-three sites (notto mention other sites that may have disappeared completely with the passage oftime, or await discovery underwater) – then how can we be sure that theirinterpretation of Maltese prehistory is correct? And if it is difficult enoughto explain how twenty-three megalithic temples appear with no architecturalantecedents at the dawn of history, on tiny arid islands that had only beeninhabited for 1600 years, then how much harder it is to account for forty-threeof them.Perhaps the answer lies in the Palaeolithic.HOW TO TELL YOUR PALAEOLITHIC FROM YOUR NEOLITHICPalaeolithic is one of those supposedly exact ‘scientific’ terms in anthropologyand archaeology that promotes inexact thought. Meaning ‘Old Stone Age’, it isdefined – arbitrarily – as having come to an end 12,000 years ago, and to havebeen followed by the Neolithic, ‘New Stone Age’, from 12,000 years ago (10,000BC) onwards. After about 7000 years of Neolithic culture, the metal ‘ages’ ofcopper (roughly third millennium BC), bronze (roughly second millennium BC), andiron (roughly first millennium BC) then followed.In summary, the term Palaeolithic is generally applied to all human remains andactivities prior to 12,000 years ago while the term Neolithic is generallyapplied to all human remains and activities between roughly 12,000 years ago and5000 years ago. However, on closer examination it turns out that the definitionsare not purely chronological – since it is possible to find certain isolatedsocieties that may be said to be at a ‘Palaeolithic’ or more often ‘Neolithic’stage of development even today.41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn41]Thus, as well as referring, somewhat vaguely, to periods of prehistory,‘Palaeolithic’ and ‘Neolithic’ are also terms that say something about thelifestyles of the people to whom they are applied. Typically, archaeologistsfocus on the types of stone tools used at a newly discovered Stone Age site (its‘lithic assembly’), on its art, on any evidence concerning its inhabitants’means of sustenance, and of course on any materials that can be dated byradiocarbon or other techniques, to get a first sense of how it should beclassified.Since we are dealing with the Stone Age here, study of the lithic assemblages isa definitive exercise. Archaeologists skilled in this field are often able at aglance to assign stone tools not only to the Palaeolithic or the Neolithic, butalso to sub-categories of those broad divisions. Moreover, it is generally trueto say that flints, scrapers, axe-heads, arrowheads and spear-points from theNeolithic end of the Stone Age spectrum are smaller, more delicate, morerefined, better made and more skilfully worked than their counterparts from thePalaeolithic.Although this fits comfortably with modern notions of progress and naturalselection (i.e., the glorious and unbroken ascent of Man, via ever finertechnology, from a ‘primitive’ to a sophisticated creature), other evidencesuggests that the arrival of the Neolithic entailed a cultural Fall. Look at theextraordinary art that Palaeolithic humans left behind, much of it painted orengraved on the walls of inaccessible European caves between roughly 30,000 and12,000 years ago. Nothing so beautiful, so technically accomplished, or so‘sophisticated’ was ever attempted again by any known culture until the time ofthe Renaissance -and Picasso is said to have commented on emerging from Lascaux:‘We have invented nothing.’42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn42]Yet Palaeolithic art is Palaeolithic art. It did not survive into the Neolithic.Another indicator is the presence of pottery – with the general rule being nonein the Palaeolithic and a gradual introduction during the Neolithic. However,the absence of pottery does not necessarily mean that a site automaticallybelongs to the Palaeolithic. Many Neolithic cultures passed through a preceramicphase, such as the first inhabitants of Mehrgarh in Pakistan, for example (Level1A), and the first two habitation layers at Jericho (pre-pottery Neolithic A andpre-pottery Neolithic B).43 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn43]Archaeologists also look at how the inhabitants of a Stone Age site got theirliving – because here they identify another important difference between thePalaeolithic and the Neolithic. In the Palaeolithic, though they sometimes livedin fixed communities, our ancestors are thought to have been hunter-gathererswith no agriculture or systematic food production of any kind. In the Neolithic,on the other hand, indeed at the very beginning of the Neolithic, agriculturewas ‘invented’ (apparently independently at several locations) andfood-production rapidly became the engine of expanding human culture.But here any precise system of definitions or chronology begins to break down.As some of the new research reviewed in earlier chapters suggests, there is nota clean ‘start-line’ in the agricultural story 12,000 years ago at the arbitrary‘beginning’ of the Neolithic. Agriculture does not seem to have taken root insome areas until thousands of years later, well inside the ‘Neolithic’ inchronological terms.None of these qualifications are supposed to matter very much in Malta, wherethe Palaeolithic is treated by archaeologists as simply irrelevant to the humanstory.44 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn44] As we’ve seen, theorthodox view holds that the Maltese islands were not inhabited by humans until7200 years ago, a Neolithic date, and that the very first people were indeedNeolithic farmers – immigrants from Sicily -with a typical Neolithic ‘tool-kit’and Neolithic pottery, etc. So when Anton Mifsud proves (as Anthony Frendo ofthe University of Malta conceded in 1999)45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn45] that humans were after allpresent on Malta in the Palaeolithic, and has even gone so far as to suggest apossible Palaeolithic origin for such complex ‘Neolithic’ structures as themegalithic temples and the Hypogeum, it should be obvious that he is steppingvery far out of line.‘Regarding the antiquity of the Hypogeum,’ Mifsud e-mailed me on 15 July 2001after I had asked him to reconfirm his position, ‘my gut feeling is that thereis strong evidence to show that it had originated in its function subserving theancient Maltese in the Palaeolithic …’46[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn46]What is that evidence?THE STRANGE CASE OF THE BISON-BULL (1)In David Trump’s authoritative Archaeological Guide to Malta, most recentlyupdated and extended in March 2000, the visitor to the Hypogeum is urged to:Pause to look at the wall opposite the stairs down to the lower storey. Darklines of black paint outline what is apparently intended to be a bull. It iscrudely done, and the head and shoulders have not survived. That it is ancientand intentional is shown by the fact that the ochre wash on the wall ceasesexactly at the black line.47 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn47]There is an amazing allegation explaining why the head and shoulders of theHypogeum bull have ‘not survived’ – and why most of the rest of its body has nowalso faded to a ghostly shadow that few visitors will be able to make out atall. The reason, reports Mifsud, is that ‘The bison-bull at the Hypogeum wasremoved at the express directive of the Director of Museums.’48[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn48]What Trump calls simply a ‘bull’ Mifsud described as a ‘bison-bull’ (an extinctspecies) for very specific anatomical reasons:Besides the multitude of drawings in red ochre at the Hypogeum, there are alsodrawings in black manganese dioxide pigment, and one of these measures 1.15 by0.95 metres. It represents a bovid, the Pleistocene European bison-bull, ‘with ahunch on its back, with short horns and tail’ [Megary, T., 1995, Society inPrehistory, page 261] and is situated on the left wall at the entrance of theHoly of Holies … The red ochre wash on the same wall is a later feature for itterminates just short of the figure. The red wash itself is a recognized featureof early Upper Palaeolithic cultures; [for example] at Tito Bustillo [northernSpain], red wash covers the entire surface of the walls, and this has been datedto the Magdalenian [15,000 to 10,000 BC] Paintings in black were dominant inearlier forms of cave art and considering the simple crude design of thisHypogeum bovid, together with its frozen aspect, the lack of perspective andinfill, and the non-differentiation between foreground and background, itsdating in the Upper Palaeolithic is therefore estimated to be very early on inthe pre-Magdalenian period.Together with the horse, the bison was a dominating theme in EuropeanPalaeolithic art. Regular bulls also feature significantly in the same culture,with entire halls of bulls being represented such as at the classicalPalaeolithic site of Lascaux, which is dated to the early Magdalenian.49[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn49]If there is any possibility that Mifsud could be right about the Palaeolithicidentity of the Hypogeum ‘bison-bull’ then the alleged act of scrubbing it offthe wall represents not just a desecration of the integrity of an ancientarchaeological site but something more sinister. The result was the destructionof scarce physical evidence which potentially contradicts teachings aboutMalta’s prehistory that are at the heart of the orthodox world view – i.e., thatMalta was not inhabited by humans during the Palaeolithic, that it remained inthis condition until 5200 BC, when it was settled by a Neolithic people fromSicily, and that the Hypogeum is, therefore, a Neolithic structure, wholly aNeolithic structure, and nothing but a Neolithic structure …THE STRANGE CASE OF THE BISON-BULL (2)Anton Mifsud’s extremely serious charge – effectively of official vandalismagainst what is now a UNESCO World Heritage site – was first put on publicrecord in Dossier Malta in 1997. I was unable to find any official rebuttal ofit or even a comment upon it from the appropriate authorities and when Icontacted Mifsud in July 2001 to confirm that he still stood by the story, hereplied that he did, 100 per cent. But, I asked, what possible motive could F.S. Mallia, the Director of Museums at the time, have had for issuing such anextraordinary order?The motive, suggested Mifsud, was just plain stubbornness. It was well knownthat in the 1960s David Trump had believed the then recently discovered bullfigure to be of archaeological significance. And it was well known that Mallia,a pupil of J. D. Evans who was at that time being trained to take over Trump’sposition, had disagreed. Much later, when Mallia was in authority at the Museum,he decided upon a final solution to the vexatious matter of the bull: ‘Malliaordered one of the employees to scrub the representation of the wall, and hethus imagined that he had settled the issue once and for all.’50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn50]THE STRANGE CASE OF THE BISON-BULL (3)I felt that it would be wrong to leave an allegation as grave as this unresolvedand on 17 July 2001, and again on 12 November 2001, I sent the following e-mailto Dr Anthony Pace, Malta’s current Director of Museums:Dear Dr Pace,Thank you for your department’s cooperation during my recent visit with theDiverse Productions film crew to shoot the Malta segment of a three-hourtelevision series (Underworld) that we are making for Britain’s Channel 4 aboutthe origins of civilization. I am the writer and presenter of this series. I amalso writing a book of the same title, to be published by Penguin. Both book andtelevision series are scheduled to come out at the same time early in 2002.In connection with these projects and in the interests of ensuring that what Iwrite is accurate and fair, I would be grateful if you would e-mail me by returnwith your official on-the-record comments on the following – potentially rathergrave – issues concerning the Museum:In their 1997 book Dossier Malta, Anton and Simon Mifsud speak of a ‘bison-bull’figure in the Hal Saflieni Hypogeum (Trump describes it simply as a ‘bull’ andnotes that ‘the head and shoulders have not survived’). The figure is or waspainted in black manganese dioxide pigment on the wall opposite the stairs downto the lower level of the Hypogeum (Trump, Archaeological Guide, 72), but Mifsudand Mifsud state on page 168 of Dossier Malta that ‘THE BISON-BULL AT THEHYPOGEUM WAS REMOVED AT THE EXPRESS DIRECTIVE OF THE DIRECTOR OF MUSEUMS’:(1) Is this extremely serious charge true?(2) If it is true, in what circumstances and for what reasons did the formerDirector of Museums [F. S. Mallia] order the removal of this prehistoricpainting?(3) How much of the painting was in fact removed and how much still remainsvisible today?(4) If this charge, on the record since 1997, is NOT true could you pleasedirect me to the place where I can find your department’s official rebuttal andrefutation of it.Additionally, I have received a more detailed account of the alleged ‘removal’of the Hypogeum bull than that given in Dossier Malta. According to thisaccount, F. S. Mallia apparently engaged in arguments about the significance ofthe bull with D. H. Trump: ‘At one point Mallia ordered one of the employees toscrub the representation off the wall, and he thus imagined that had settled theissue once and for all.’Would you like to comment on behalf of the Museum about this account of theevents?I would also be grateful if you could supply me with Dr Mallia’s presentcontacts so that I may invite him to comment on this matter directly.I look forward very much to hearing from you.Yours sincerely,Graham HancockDespite sending the e-mail twice to Dr Pace, and once to another member of staffat the Museum to pass on to him directly, I have not, at time of writing (15November 2001) received any reply. I read nothing sinister into this. Dr Pace,having only been Director of Museums since 1999, may have no knowledge of theissue and was certainly in no way involved in the events themselves. However, itis disappointing not to have the benefit of his comments on this importantquestion. Nor have I been able to confirm or refute the story by questioning F.S. Mallia, the former Director of Museums alleged to have ordered the removal ofthe bull figure. Unfortunately Dr Mallia passed away some years ago.THE STRANGE CASE OF THE BISON-BULL (4)The next step was to talk to D. H. Trump, now retired in Cambridge, so Iprepared a list of questions for him and asked my assistant Sharif to find himand interview him. The recorded interview, which sheds some further light on themystery, took place on 26 October 2001:Sharif: In your Archaeological Guide – this is the main source I’m going on, theupdated edition – you mention a bull in the Hypogeum and you say, ‘Pause to lookat the wall opposite the stairs down to the lower storey. Dark lines of blackpaint outline what is apparently intended to be a bull. It is crudely done, andthe head and shoulders have not survived. That it is ancient and intentional isshown by the fact that the ochre wash on the wall ceases exactly at the blackline.’ Do you remember the bull I’m talking about?Trump: I do indeed.Sharif: OK, now in Dossier Malta, Mifsud alleges that …Trump: That this was scrubbed out.Sharif: Yes, he alleges that it was scrubbed out.Trump: The very simple answer to that is what on earth would Francis Mallia havewanted to scrub it out for? Absolutely no motive for this. It was very slightindeed in the first place. It is known that there has been deterioration of thepaint under the Hypogeum – this is what all the recent restoration work has beendoing to try to stabilize the situation as it is now.Sharif: So what’s the cause of the deterioration? Is it the tourists visitingthe site, something in the air? Trump: Presumably, yes.Sharif: Mifsud says that Mallia was a pupil of J. D. Evans.Trump: Yes, he was sent back to study under Evans at the Institute ofArchaeology in London, to give him the qualifications to take over the job.Sharif: And the suggestion is that because Mallia was a pupil of J. D. Evans, hehad a position that was somewhat contrary to your own position, such that youtwo entered into a disagreement about the significance of this bull. And it wasfollowing this disagreement between you and Mallia that Mallia ordered anemployee of the Museum …Trump: I don’t think the Museum knows anything about him.Sharif: He was a nobody in terms of academia?Trump: We don’t know who he was.Sharif: Right, but what do you have to say about this general picture of adispute between yourself and Mallia?Trump: Well, as with all scholarship, we had slightly different views of this. Iwas more willing to accept this very faint figure than Mallia was. The bullfigure. I wouldn’t regard this as a disagreement, we certainly didn’t squabbleover the issue.Sharif: So it was a difference in academic viewpoint?Trump: Well yes. I was prepared to accept – by the way it was our curator therewho pointed it out to us; no one had noticed it before; it was as faint as that.I looked at it and thought, ‘Well maybe there’s something in it.’ I wanted toput it into the Guide so that people could …Sharif: Look for themselves …Trump: Have a look and make up their own minds. Whereas Mallia was rather moredubious of it. But I wouldn’t put it more strongly than that. And to call it adisagreement is quite misleading.Sharif: OK, so really the disagreement was that you thought it was ofarchaeological significance … Trump: I wouldn’t even put it as strongly as that.I thought it might be, he thought it probably wasn’t.Sharif: So his view was that it was actually impossible to take anything from it– even to be sure that it was an ancient piece of art?Trump: Yes.Sharif: And your view was that it might be?Trump: Yes.Sharif: But you’d never seen it in a state of better preservation – from theoutset it was rubbed off?Trump: From the outset it was extremely faint. As I say, no one noticed it untilour curator, who obviously was up and down passing it every day for years,spotted what he thought might be something, and pointed it out to theauthorities at the museum. We went and had a look and said, ‘Well, maybe’ – butit was never any clearer than that.Sharif: You’ve seen his figure yourself – what remains of it?Trump: It was barely perceptible then, I wouldn’t … well it’s even lessperceptible now.Sharif: So have you seen the changes?Trump: Oh yes.Sharif: And those are the changes that the restoration project is trying tostop?Trump: Yes.Sharif: These are not deliberate changes – they’re changes that all touristsites have to think about?Trump: Yes, the question of the air conditioning and the like …Sharif: Is there any part of this bull figure which leads you to think aboutMifsud’s suggestion that it actually represents an extinct species? Is thereenough of it left for you to tell that?Trump: No.Sharif: What do you think Mifsud is basing that on? He actually takes it assuggestive evidence of a Palaeolithic presence by saying that this is aPalaeolithic species painted in a Palaeolithic style.Trump: Frankly, rubbish! The site wasn’t there – wasn’t excavated until longafter the Palaeolithic.Sharif: Right, how do we know that?Trump: Well, from the archaeological content.Sharif: From radiocarbon-dating of that content?Trump: Well, not directly from the Hypogeum, which was excavated back in 1910 –long before radiocarbon. But there was no archaeological material, no pottery oranything out of the Hypogeum earlier than the Zebbug phase. Which, withradiocarbon, we’d now put at about 4000 BC. The chambers were deliberatelyexcavated, but not before 4000 BC. So there’s no question of extinct Pleistocenespecies.THE STRANGE CASE OF THE BISON-BULL (5)Mifsud’s position, while the complete opposite of Trump’s, is not contradictedby the presence in the Hypogeum of materials only of the Zebbug phase andyounger. As we saw earlier in this chapter he disputes the view that theHypogeum was constructed as a place of burial and has presented evidence thatthe materials and skeletal remains found inside it by archaeologists were notdeliberately placed there but are a flood deposit carried in from surroundingNeolithic burial sites. The dating of those remains to the Neolithic Zebbugphases and younger is therefore exactly what Mifsud’s theory predicts and leaveseffectively unchallenged the revolutionary possibility that lies at the heart ofhis analysis – i.e., that the structure itself may long pre-date the Neolithic.‘Regarding the antiquity of the Hypogeum,’ he confirms:my gut feeling is that there is strong evidence to show that it had originatedin its function subserving the ancient Maltese in the Palaeolithic, and thebovine representation constitutes one of the main arguments for this.51[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn51]A RE-EVALUATIONAs well as the unresolved (and now probably unresolvable) question of thebison-bull with its possible pre-Magdalenian associations, Mifsud points toMalta’s Goddess cult as further support for his view that the islands’prehistoric culture may have developed from very ancient Palaeolithic roots. Theso-called ‘Sleeping Lady’ statues found in the Hypogeum and numerous ‘Venus’figurines found throughout Malta’s megalithic temples leave little doubt that aform of Mother Goddess was the supreme deity worshipped in these mysteriousplaces. But these artifacts ‘have all been attributed arbitrarily to theNeolithic’,52 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn52] even though theyare distinctly characteristic of European Palaeolithic art forms, dating as farback at 30,000 BP.In brief, Mifsud also draws attention to the following points: * Modern research into the Palaeolithic cave art of Europe ‘includes the study of wall configuration and their adaptation to the drawings, and to the significance of human voice resonance, a feature which immediately brings to mind the Oracle room of the Hypogeum’.53 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn53] * The art forms in the Hypogeum call for a re-evaluation. ‘The designs in red ochre and black pigment draw strong parallels with Palaeolithic sites abroad. The red ochre designs have hitherto been traditionally assigned to a “tree of life” nature and dated arbitrarily to the Neolithic.’54 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn54] * At the entrance to one of the Hypogeum’s painted rooms, the faint engraved impression of a large human hand, also arbitrarily assigned to the Neolithic, may still be seen. It ‘has parallels in similar designs in Palaeolithic sites at Gargas, El Castillo, and particularly with Montespan in the Franco-Cantabrian region.’55 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn55] The impression shows a hand with six fingers56 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn56] [a condition known as Polydactyly that is also seen on at least one of the ‘Fat Lady’ figures on show in the National Museum of Archaeology].57 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn57] * Also of great interest is another Hypogeum design. It ‘is in the form of an ideogram and comprises a black and white chequered pattern; this simple geometric design is considered to represent an early stage of Palaeolithic art’.58 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn58] * Last but not least, tests have been conducted on the red ochre pigments in the Hypogeum for their constituent mineral components. In 1987samples were taken of red ochre pigment on rock from the north corner of theOracle room, together with a rock sample without pigment from the same room. Onthe 26th of July these were examined at the Smithsonian Institute, WashingtonDC, at the Conservation Analytical Laboratory. Both samples were submitted tox-ray diffraction studies and the red ochre sample was also viewed through ascanning electron microscope. In keeping with the routine composition of Palaeolithic art pigments, these samples confirmed the presence of the oxides ofSilicon, Iron, Aluminium, Calcium, Potassium, Sodium and Magnesium.An earlier study, carried out by Janusz Lehman in 1979, tested two samples ofred ochre pigment from the decorations in the Hypogeum’s middle level. As wellas all the above ingredients these samples contained traces of manganesedioxide, the main component of black. ‘This finding confirms that the red ochredesign examined by Lehman had been superimposed upon an even earlier design inPalaeolithic black pigment.’59 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn59]None of this is to insist that all or even most of the designs inside theHypogeum do in fact date back to the Palaeolithic – only that there is asignificant possibility that some of them do.That the Hypogeum was extensively used, and perhaps even developed and expandedduring the Neolithic, and that this happened in more or less exactly thetime-frame allocated to it by archaeologists (i.e., 3600–2500 BC) is not, Irepeat not, in dispute here. But what is contested is any attempt to claim thatthe scholarly consensus explains everything about this dark and powerfullabyrinth beneath the ground and that the ‘minor mysteries’60[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn60] of the Hypogeum’s true originsand antiquity have long been solved – ‘cleared out of the system’,61[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn61] by leading academics.The consensus may be correct. But I believe Anton Mifsud has successfullydemonstrated that important evidence contrary to the consensus does exist, hasbeen overlooked and, in at least one case – the bison-bull – may actually havebeen extirpated like an idol brought before the Inquisition.A PATTERN?If a failure to preserve and consider potentially controversial evidence hasfrustrated a full understanding of the Hypogeum, then the same is also true forthe megalithic temples and even the prehistoric cave sites in Malta. Thus,Mifsud points out that archaeologists excavating Ghar Dalam cave in the earlytwentieth century (see chapter 18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c18_r1.htm#c18] for afuller treatment of Ghar Dalam) ‘discovered several knives, scrapers, borers andburins in previously undisturbed deposits, and although stratigraphicallyPleistocene, they have been arbitrarily attributed to the Neolithic’.62[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn62]Likewise, there is the matter of twenty-six flint implements (flint is notnative to the Maltese islands) which were excavated at Hagar Qim, also in theearly twentieth century:They are illustrated in Zammit’s The Valletta Museum [1931, plate facing page21] but have since gone missing. The implements comprised blades and bladelets,microliths, scrapers and burins, all datable to the Upper Palaeolithic.63[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn63] [My emphasis.]Probably there’s nothing to it. Still, it does seem bizarre that so muchevidence with the potential to support a Palaeolithic human presence on Maltagets lost or damaged.Finally, together with Charles Savona Ventura, Mifsud draws attention to thelittle-known Ghar Hasan cave located on a precipitous cliff-face on Malta’ssouth coast not far from the more famous Ghar Dalam.64[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn64] This cave was investigated in1987 by a high-powered team of Italian archaeologists from the Centro Camuno diStudi Preistorici led by Emanual Anati, Professor of Palaeoethnology at LecceUniversity and a world authority on cave art. Anati has since issued a series ofpublications concerning Ghar Hasan, the most recent in 1995:65[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn65]For the first time in the long history of the cave, a repertoire of Palaeolithicart forms were partially uncovered from beneath the stalagmitic encrustationswhich covered them for the past fifteen millennia. The figures numberedaltogether approximately 20 designs, and they are painted in red, brown, darkbrown and black. They represent various animal figures, an anthropozoomorphicdesign, several handprints and an array of ideograms …In Panel One, at least two of the animal figures represent the elephant, ‘twoheavy quadrupeds with a long muzzle’. These animals were extinct in Malta beforethe end of the Pleistocene.66 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn66]The so-called ‘Pleistocene/Holocene boundary’ in geology coincides quite closelywith the Palaeolithic/Neolithic boundary in archaeology. So what Anati’sexpedition seemed to have found with these representations of extinct species inGhar Hasan was more evidence of a Palaeolithic human presence on Malta.Soon after news broke about these published conclusions and their starkcontradiction of the orthodox view on Malta’s prehistory, the Italian teamdistanced itself from its initial Palaeolithic leanings and claimed instead thatthe depictions in Ghar Hasan are ‘out of context’ – which indeed they are if oneis only prepared to countenance a Neolithic context for the earliest humanpresence in Malta.Another development at about the same time was that the Ghar Hasan cave began tobe vandalized, and the paintings defaced or completely removed, a process thatcontinued over a long period. The result, which would have caused aninternational furore anywhere else but Malta, is that today:The only depictions which have survived, unless more are obscured by stalagmiticmaterial on the cavern walls, are the two handprints in red pigment in Gallery D… Vandalism not of the popular type has destroyed and obscured the entirerepertoire of images on the accessible areas.67[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn67]The best paintings described, photographed and published by Anati,68[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn68] were in the ‘Gallery A’ sectionof Ghar Dalam. Within a few weeks of the arrival in Malta of Anati’spublication, a steel gate was erected that restricted access to this section.Officially, the gate had nothing to do with Anati’s publication or the vandalismof the paintings, but was ‘for the protection of a small colony of bats’.69[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn69]THE GHOST OF PILTDOWN MANRigorous scientist that he is, Anton Mifsud would be the first to admit thatnone of the clues, hints, anachronisms, anomalies and whispers of conspiracythat he has amassed from the Hypogeum and the megalithic temples of Malta areproof that these structures had a Palaeolithic origin. Certainly they aresuggestive! But they prove nothing and they run entirely contrary toincreasingly accurate C-14 evidence that archaeologists have had at theirdisposal since the 1950s – revolutionized by dendrochronology in the 1960s70[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn70] – which places thetemple-building period within a definite time-band in the Neolithic (3600–2500BC) and finds no evidence of any human presence in Malta at any date prior to5200 BC, let alone as far back as the Palaeolithic.71[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn71] The earliest radiocarbonevidence of a definite human presence in Malta is from Ghar Dalam and gives aNeolithic date of around 5200 BC.72[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-ftn72] The orthodox position is that nosamples taken anywhere in the Maltese islands suggest any earlier date.So it is clearly not enough, if one wishes to propose something so radical andupsetting as a Palaeolithic human presence in Malta, merely to offer apparentsimilarities in religious iconography, apparent similarities in artistic styles,apparently similar types of pigments used, etc. Such impressions are all verywell, and even helpful, but the interpretation of them is bound to besubjective. What is needed in addition to all this is solid empirical evidence –from scientific tests supported by reliable provenance and stratigraphy – thatconfirms a more ancient presence of man.Naturally Anton Mifsud would not have embarked on his course of confrontationwith the archaeological authorities over the basic terms of Maltese prehistoryif he did not possess such evidence. He does. And in the process of acquiringit, as we shall see, he has uncovered some very strange and disturbingarchaeological behaviour that took place during the 1950s and 1960s. This wasthe precise period in which the foundations of Maltese prehistory were beinglaid down by Professor J. D. Evans. It is not an accident that this was also theperiod when the islands became defined as ‘apalaeolithic’ – i.e., not inhabitedby humans before the Palaeolithic – a definition that has been taught to latergenerations of archaeologists as dogma. The scandal has even gone so far as toentangle the Natural History Museum in London in its clutches and to resurrectthe restless ghost of Piltdown Man.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_082_r1.jpg]27.

Evans, 19591 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn1]The conspiracy of silence over the decades represents the triumph of prejudiceover logic.Anton Mifsud, 19972 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn2]The whole thing is in limbo, really …David Trump, October 20013 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn3]When did people first live on the Maltese islands? The question seems innocentand simple enough – almost routine – but evidence that has a bearing on it hasbeen tampered with and lost, and the search for the correct answer to it is thefundamental issue of Maltese prehistory. Because of Malta’s special place in thewider story of civilization it is a fundamental issue of global prehistory aswell. For how can we claim to have understood the origins of civilization if wehave failed to unravel properly the processes and motivations, the skills andthe ideas, that led up to the creation of humanity’s first ever works ofmonumental religious architecture?4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn4]And what architecture it is! * Not simple rough-and-ready building experiments as one might expect, but beautiful, accomplished, harmonious structures that were the work of master architects, planners and stone masons, from the very beginning. * Not monuments that were easy to make, but monuments that were extremely difficult to make – and that would be difficult to make in any epoch, with any technology. * Monuments like Gigantija, described in chapter 15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c15_r1.htm#c15], with its walls of 5 metre tall megaliths. * Monuments like the Hypogeum, an incredible achievement of troglodytic burrowing and hewing to create a mysterious labyrinth beneath the earth. * Monuments like Hagar Qim and Mnajdra that feature astronomical and solar alignments requiring years of careful observations and measurements to confirm and install.So what was going on in Malta that led to all this? Why did the first megalithictemple-builders in the world choose to make things so difficult for themselves?Why didn’t they start with small megaliths (if that is not too serious acontradiction in terms)? Why didn’t they start simple? Why did they plungestraight into the very complicated stuff, like Gigantija and the Hypogeum? And,having plunged, how did they manage to produce such magnificent results? Was itbeginner’s luck? Or were their achievements as humanity’s pioneering architectsthe product of some sort of heritage?Beginner’s luck is possible, but having studied the earliest temples, and theirlevel of perfection, archaeologists agree that heritage is the right answer. Theonly problem is what heritage? And where is it to be looked for? Since it is thereceived wisdom that no human beings lived on Malta before 5200 BC, and sincethis is a ‘fact’ that is at present unquestioned anywhere within conventionalscholarship, archaeologists from roughly the mid-twentieth century onwards havesimply seen no reason to explore the possibility that the heritage of theMaltese temples might be older than 5200 BC. To do so would be the researchequivalent of an oxymoron – like breeding dodos, trying to conduct an interviewwith William Shakespeare or seeking evidence that the earth is flat – and wouldinvite the ridicule of one’s peers.The result, necessarily, is that archaeological inquiry into the origins ofmonumental civilization in Malta has been confined to the narrow chronologicalband between 5200 BC – the supposed date the islands were first settled -and3600 BC, the supposed date that Gigantija was built. Whatever alchemytransformed the rude and unimpressive stone and brickwork of the Maltese of thefifth millennium BC into the awe-inspiring cyclopean temples of the fourthmillennium BC is therefore – again necessarily – to be traced within thisperiod, not outside it. The only possible external and earlier influence thatmight reasonably be countenanced by proponents of this model could, as noted inchapter 16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c16_r1.htm#c16], lie in ‘intellectualbaggage’ that the original Neolithic settlers presumed to have first colonizedMalta from Sicily in 5200 BC – the Stentinello culture – might have brought withthem. But the evidence is against this, since the Stentinello people of Sicilydid not develop a megalithic culture and, indeed, there are ‘no true megalithicmonuments’ at all anywhere in Sicily.5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn5]So we’re back to Malta again, confronted by the massive physical presence of theworld’s first monumental architecture. And since it assaults common sense tosuggest that such huge and accomplished temples could be the work of people whohad never built with megaliths before, we’re searching for the intermediatestructures on which the Maltese stone masons presumably must have learned theircraft during the first 1600 years that there were people at all on Malta -i.e.between 5200 and 3600 BC.5200–3600 BC, THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS’ STORYGHAR DALAM 5200–4500 BCThe first phase of human settlement that archaeologists recognize, 5200–4500 BC,is known as the Ghar Dalam phase. The name is from the type site, Ghar Dalamcave itself, but the ‘Phase’, defined by its pottery and tools, is representedat sites throughout Malta and Gozo. This phase has left no evidence of anylarge-scale construction activities at all. Nor is it easy to make out any ofthe signs of organized cultic and religious behaviour that normally precedefull-blown temple worship. All that has come down to us are a few traces ofrudimentary huts and shelters and a stumpy wall, 11 metres long but less than ametre high, made of two rows of small upright slabs with a filling of rubble inbetween.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn6]SKORBA, 4500–4100 BCArchaeologists identify a second phase immediately following Ghar Dalam, ofwhich the type site is Skorba (not to be confused with the megalithic temple atSkorba – itself of the Gigantija phase and later! – which stands near by). Thedates of the Skorba phase are 4500–4100 BC and there is no doubt that thearchitecture does get bigger and more impressive during these 400 years. Indeed,Trump proposes, and some of his colleagues agree with him, that two oval roomsat Skorba which have been carbon-dated to 4100 BC may actually be the firstprecursors of the later temple architecture.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn7] The pebbled courtyard of thenorthern room is partially covered by the eastern side of the temple, providinga clear sequence, in full accord with orthodox chronology, in which the Skorbaphase, and its C-14 date, precede the Gigantija and later phases of the temple-with all the phases nicely stacked up one on top of the other on the same site.Trump thinks that the two rooms may have been basements, ‘as the southern onehad no doorway through its massive walls’. The northern room, on the other hand,was entered by way of the pebbled courtyard mentioned above.8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn8] Within the rooms:The irregularity of the floors and the unlevelled surface of the bedrock argueagainst domestic use, and the group of figurines … from the northern room alsosuggest that this building had a religious function, a true predecessor, then,of the temples which appeared some centuries later. The main difference inconstruction was that the upper walls had been built in mud-brick shaped fromMaltese blue clay.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn9]I must protest in passing that while irregular unlevelled bedrock floors doargue against domestic use they do not inevitably suggest that that building hada religious function (all the later temples had levelled floors). Conversely,the figurines that Trump mentions do suggest a religious function similar tothat of the temples and the Hypogeum since they include ‘female figurines,stylized and with greatly exaggerated buttocks’.10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn10]On the basis of the oval shape of the rooms and the versions of the familiargoddess images found within them it is hard to disagree that there is aconnection here. On the other hand, there is no trace whatsoever of megalithicarchitecture in these oval rooms from 4100 BC. Their walls may be ‘massive’, asTrump suggests, but the architectural and engineering challenges faced inbuilding them are not to be compared in any way with the challenges that facedthe temple-builders.So, yes, the people of the Skorba phase did build big structures. And yes, theydo seem to have venerated the Goddess within them. But the walls of thesestructures were made of small, easily handled stones and rubble packed togetherand surmounted by mud-bricks,11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn11]so they can hardly be described in architectural and enginering terms as‘intermediate’ steps on the way to the megalithic temples.ZEBBUG, 4100–3800 BCThe next phase of Maltese prehistory is named Zebbug – as usual after the typesite – and is dated from 4100 to 3800 BC. Archaeologists classify this phase asbeing within the ‘Temple period since it occupied that last five centuriesbefore the construction of the first megalithic temples – during which time, itis assumed, Maltese society must have been gearing itself up in various ways forthe colossal effort that lay ahead. The evidence for this gearing-up process is,however, not overwhelming. The Zebbug phase produced no megalithic architectureand no rock-hewn temples, but is identified by stylistic changes in pottery anddistinguished by what are thought to be the first rock-hewn tombs in Malta – agroup of five rather unimpressive dish-shaped depressions discovered in a fieldin the parish of Zebbug in 1947.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn12] A few are somewhat elliptical13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn13] and might be said to bearcomparison with the elliptical ‘theme’ of the temples and the Hypogeum –although none of the labyrinthine or subterranean characteristics of the latterare present at Zebbug.A twin-chambered rock-cut tomb from the Zebbug phase has also been found on Gozoclose to the temple of Gigantija. It is a collective tomb and consists of avertical shaft approximately 1 metre deep opening into two low-roofed, shallow,rock-cut chambers that had been filled up, over many centuries, with the bonesof fifty-four adults and eleven children:Most of the bones were disarticulated and pushed to the back and sides of thechambers, as if to make way for a more recent burial. Indeed at the entrance toone of the chambers lay the contracted almost complete skeleton of an adultmale, presumably the last of the burials.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn14]A stylized human bust of stone was placed at the entrance to one of thechambers, as if intended to guard the tomb.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn15]Other Zebbug phase tombs, at Xemxija, which feature kidney-shaped and‘clover-leaf’ rock-hewn chambers devolving off a central shaft just under ametre deep, have been proposed by J. D. Evans as possible models for thecharacteristic kidney-shaped apsidal rooms of the megalithic temples – a viewthat David Trump also believes has ‘much to recommend it’.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn16]MGARR, 3800–3600 BCAfter the Zebbug phase – again rather loosely classified as being within thetemple period but still before a single example of megalithic architecture hadappeared, archaeologists insert the Mgarr phase, 3800–3600 BC.17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn17] Essentially irrelevant to thequest for intermediate structures on which the temple-builders practised andhoned their skills, Mgarr is classified by its pottery – ‘a transitional phasenamed after the site in Malta where a development in style of the Zebbug potterywas first noticed’.18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn18]GIGANTIJAAnd then suddenly, around 3600 BC, the fireworks start to fly with the Gigantijaphase (3600–3000 BC). Here, as we know, the type site is not a pottery heap, amud-brick wall, or a few rock-cut tombs, but Gigantija herself – the ‘tower ofthe giants’ – literally the mother of all temples if the orthodox chronology iscorrect, built with megaliths that are consistently amongst the biggest everused in Malta.KNOW-HOW HAS TO START SOMEWHEREHow are we to explain such a sudden and dramatic leap forward as the appearancein the Gigantija phase not only of the ‘blueprint’ for the archetypal Maltesemegalithic temple – to which, with adaptations and refinements, all latertemples adhere – but also, at the same instant, the complete suite oforganizational and technical abilities necessary to build such temples when, weare told, none had ever been built before?In a recent paper on the architecture of the Maltese temples, Trump admits thereis a problem:Know-how has to start somewhere. Though building in stone was first introducedto Malta by the first settlers, as was shown at Skorba, the use of huge blocks,so-called megalithic architecture, is not known before the temple period. Theskills must have been built up slowly, over time.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn19]I am not an archaeologist, but after reviewing what archaeology has found outabout the 1600 years between the supposed date of first settlement and thebeginning of temple-building at Gigantija – 5200 BC down to 3600 BC – Ipersonally see no convincing evidence of any build-up of skills ‘slowly, overtime’ that would have been relevant to the construction of the megalithictemples.I note that Trump and Evans both hint that the temples may somehow have evolvedout of the shape of Zebbug phase tombs, and there is an undeniable resemblance.But even if we accept that the shape of the tombs of 4100 BC is related to theshape of the temples of 3600 BC – giving us 500 years of ‘evolution’ to explainthe phenomenon of Gigantija – this still leaves unanswered the bigger questionof how and where the ancient Maltese learned to reproduce such shapes, aboveground, in megaliths weighing many tonnes?Could the solution be that another wave of settlers arrived in 3600 BC bringingthe temple blueprint and the necessary building skills with them? This was oncea fashionable idea that has gone out of favour as the archaeology of Malta andof the Mediterranean as a whole has improved. As David Trump has recentlyaffirmed, ‘There is nothing looking remotely like one of these temples outsidethe Maltese islands, so we cannot use “foreign influence”, to explain themaway.’20 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn20] Likewise, far back as1959 J. D. Evans wrote:It is abundantly clear … that the Maltese temples and tombs were somethingindigenous, rooted in the beliefs and customs of the people whose religion theyexpress, and they evolved step by step with these. There seems no question oftheir having been introduced as a result of influence from other cultures.21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn21]So we have come full circle back to Malta again, still searching for the babytemples, the kid temples, the adolescent temples – or if not temples then otherkinds of structures requiring the same skills – that ought to precede themature, prime-of-life temples of the Gigantija and later phases. And they aren’tthere.Could this be for the same reason that Malta lacks what Anton Mifsud calls a‘civilization territory’ big enough to account for the impressive manifestationsof civilization scattered all over the Maltese islands? Could we be missing theevolutionary phases of the great megalithic temples because the land on whichthose phases are represented is now underwater? And, the corollary of this, isthere any evidence that submergences on a sufficient scale to obliterate theentire hinterland of a culture have ever occurred in the Maltese archipelago?It is here that settling the date of Malta’s first inhabitation by humansbecomes pivotal to our inquiry. Because if we accept the orthodox academic viewthat these islands were entirely without a human presence until 5200 BC, then wewould have no reason to be interested in floods that might have occurred earlierthan that date. But suppose there is reason to doubt the academic verdict?Suppose, for example, it were to transpire that Malta had in fact been peopledduring the late Palaeolithic, from as early as 18,000 years ago. Then thepossibility would have to be seriously countenanced that these Palaeolithicinhabitants and their descendants could have been responsible for the evolutionand development of the architecture of the ‘Temple period’ – with the morepopulous Neolithic settlers merely participating in and merging their identitywith its last phases.This is why the misrepresentation and possibly even manipulation of evidence byparty or parties unknown to give a falsely late date for the earliest humanpresence in Malta that Anton Mifsud has exposed is, potentially, of explosivesignificance.THE LEAVINGS OF VIOLENT FLOODSThe story begins at Ghar Dalam, a spacious natural cave more than 7 metres wide,5 metres high and 120 metres long that opens into the wall of one of Malta’smany precipitous valleys, the Wied Dalam, located in the south-east of theisland. Though it is arid today, the valley was gouged out by a great river andfloods that have flowed violently through it at various times in the past. Itcontinues for just over half a kilometre beyond the cave mouth before finallyplunging beneath the sea in Saint George’s Bay.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_096_r1.jpg]The cave is thought to have begun its existence as a solution cavity dissolvedin the bedrock by percolating groundwater that was later broken into from above,penetrated and extended by these palaeo-floods. In the process the ongoingerosion of the river bed cut down the valley floor still further so that it nowlies 6 metres below the level of the cave mouth. There have been severaloccasions during the past quarter of a million years when the flooding has beenon such a scale as to overtop the valley sides and completely inundate the cave,leaving behind layers of muddy earth, clay and pebbles mixed with a fantasticassortment of animal remains that were carried along in the flood waters.Archaeologists say that the last of these cataclysmic flood deposits was laiddown during the melting of the Ice Age. John Samut Tagliaferro of the Universityof Malta dates the event to 18,000 years ago.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn22] David Trump goes for a slightlymore recent estimate: ‘[This] level in the cave yielded great numbers of reddeer bones and was probably laid down in the cool wet period of the closingstages of the last Ice Age some 10,000 years ago.’23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn23] After that terminal Ice Ageevent between 18,000 and 10,000 years ago no further flood deposits were laiddown. The river in the valley floor ran dry and the cave remained undisturbed,gathering dust, visited only by grubbing wild animals, for almost 3000 years.Finally, so the official story goes, human beings began to register theirpresence there with the earliest traces of their occupation – supposedly theoldest in Malta – radiocarbon-dated to around 5200 BC. The dates are from theso-called ‘Cultural Layer’ of the cave: a thin deposit containing beads andother ornaments, buttons, tools, weapons, bones and rubbish – the usual detritusof human habitation – and also fragments of the distinctive incised pottery,excavated here and at other sites in Malta, by which the Ghar Dalam phase as awhole is classified.24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn24]Because of the earlier flood epochs, however, archaeologists excavating beneaththe Cultural Layer found five other layers of deposits, providing a completearchive of climate, ecology and fauna in Malta over approximately the pastquarter of a million years. In brief, and in descending order (with the youngestlayer, of course, being the highest), we have:6. The Cultural Layer: traces of Neolithic man from 5200 BC onwards.5. The Calcareous Layer: a thin, sterile, chalky deposit that usefully ‘seals’the older Pleistocene (Ice Age) layers beneath it and serves as a clearseparator between them and the post-glacial Cultural Layer above.4. The Cervus Layer: the most recent of the flood deposits, dated to between18,000 and 10,000 years ago and so named because it contains the bones (inimmense quantities) of the Pleistocene European red deer (Cervus elephas, anextinct species). Other Ice Age faunal remains in the Cervus Layer include thoseof wolf, brown bear and fox.3. The Pebble Layer: just that, a stratum consisting almost entirely of stonesand pebbles swept into the cave by water action and strewn across its floor.2. The Hippopotamus Layer: in which the remains of extinct species of dwarfhippopotamus and dwarf elephant predominate.1. The Clay Layer: immediately above bedrock. This layer, the oldest, formingthe bottom of the Ghar Dalam sequence, is sterile and contains no remainswhatsoever.It is certain anomalous discoveries that were made by archaeologists excavatingthe Cervus (Deer) Layer during the first half of the twentieth century – and thesubsequent fate of these discoveries – that threaten to turn the prehistory ofMalta on its head.COOKED HIPPO, A HUMAN HAND BONE, AND SOME STONE TOOLSIn fact, points out Mifsud in Dossier Malta, the first anomalous discovery wasmade much earlier than that – by the Italian scholar Arturo Issel in the 1860s.He began an excavation at Ghar Dalam at an arbitrary 100 paces from the caveentrance:The remarkable finds of his, the first official excavation of Ghar Dalam,included the burnt remains of hippopotamus, whose bones had apparently beencooked and opened up to extract the marrow for consumption.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn25]The burnt remains of a hippo with its bones in the condition described dostrongly suggest a human presence. However, little attention has ever been paidto Issel’s finds, which have not been preserved and have never been consideredpart of Malta’s archaeological story.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn26]Mifsud’s research also revealed that further excavations had been conducted inthe 1890s by a certain John H. Cooke, a teacher with a systematic approachtowards archaeology. He dug a series of eight trenches at regular intervalsthroughout the cave from its deep interior to a point just 10 metres before theentrance:The main finds were in two trenches. A human hand bone was found in his TrenchIV, in the Cervus Layer, whilst a human implement was discovered in Trench VI,also in the deer layer. For the first time human implements and remains lay inthe same horizon below the cultural layers of Ghar Dalam, precisely in theCervus Layer.Immediately overlooking Cooke’s layer ‘e’, the fifth layer from the surface, andequivalent to the Cervus Layer, at a depth of two feet three inches, a stoneimplement was discovered by Cooke. According to Dr A. A. Caruana, he was ‘of theopinion that it has undoubtedly been fashioned by man’.27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn27]The next digs followed in 1912–13, coordinated by Napoleon Tagliaferro andGuiseppe Despott. Their project was taken over a year later by the BritishAssociation, but Despott remained involved, conducting further digs with TemiZammit in 1914, and leading the digs in 1916 and 1917.THE RISE AND FALL OF DESPOTT’S AND RIZZO’S BIG TEETHDuring the 1917 dig the discovery was made, again in the Cervus Layer, of twohuman teeth of a very special type known as ‘taurodont’ (the word meansliterally ‘bull-tooth’ and refers to the supposed ‘bull-like’ appearance of thetooth, with a large heavy body and extremely short or non-existent roots). AntonMifsud takes up the story:The breakthrough came about in the summer of 1917, in one of the two trenchesDespott had excavated that year. Trench I was situated 50 feet from theentrance, and the crucial Trench II lay 60 feet further inside the cave. It wasin the latter, Trench II, that two taurodont molars were discovered in thestratum of red cave earth. The curator Giuseppe Despott and a Mr Carmelo Rizzowere supervising their men digging in Trench II, when the latter’s workers cameacross a large bull-shaped human molar tooth amongst several deer teeth obtainedfrom the Deer Layer of this trench; a few days later Despott himself discovereda similar molar a few feet away, several inches deeper in the cave earth …Despott’s molar was registered as lying one foot deeper in the cave earth of theCervus Layer, and separated by seven feet from Rizzo’s; the pair of molarspossibly derived from two individuals, but their relative proximity cannotexclude a single source. The teeth had an unusually large pulp cavity so thatthe roots were very small.28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn28]By chance, just a few years earlier, the famous British palaeoanthropologist andanatomist Sir Arthur Keith had described unusual teeth of exactly this sortfound at sites elsewhere in Europe. He had attributed these teeth to NeanderthalMan and it was he who had coined the term ‘taurodont’ for them.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn29] Now Rizzo and Keith submittedphotographs of their molars to Keith for examination and were delighted when hediagnosed them, without hesitation, as taurodont:In size and form such teeth have been seen in no race of mankind except H.Neanderthalis; in condition of fossilization and in the fauna which keep themcompany, in the red cave earth in Ghar Dalam, they are in their properPleistocene setting.30 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn30]Keith followed this up by writing a letter to Nature on the subject and, insubsequent years, the hypothesis began to be widely accepted, indeed orthodox,that at least Neanderthal humans had been present on Malta during thePalaeolithic and had left their remains at Ghar Dalam. The view was strengthenedin the 1920s by the discovery of a large number of definitely late Neolithichuman remains and artefacts, including 2250 teeth, in the Burmeghez cave. Keithexamined the teeth carefully and could not find a single example of taurodontismamong them. This he took as further support for his hypothesis of the more‘primitive’ Palaeolithic origin of the Ghar Dalam teeth.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn31]Soon afterwards the hypothesis came under attack from various quarters.Scattered reports had begun to appear in the dental literature of taurodontteeth in modern humans, which, if confirmed, would much reduce the probabilitythat Despotts and Rizzo’s molars were very old Neanderthal teeth – rather, forexample, than more recent ones that had somehow (perhaps through burial) beenintroduced into the Cervus Layer. However, further investigation of the evidencedemonstrated that while some of the modern teeth were genuinely taurodontic noneof them showed anything like the degree of taurodontism evident in Despott’s andRizzo’s molars.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn32] Under aclassification that Keith had already proposed the latter were as‘hypertaurodontic’ as any Neanderthal teeth from other parts of Europe, whereasthe modern human teeth were mesotaurodontic or more commonly hypotaurodontic(the least severe form of the condition).33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn33]Keith’s defence held, there was support from other worthy authorities, a thirdtaurodontic tooth was discovered in 1936 by Dr J. Baldacchino (then the Curatorof the Museum) in the same Cervus Layer as the two 1917 molars34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn34] – and through the combination ofall these favourable auspices, ‘A slot was secured for Neanderthal humans in theMaltese history books, albeit for a few decades.’35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn35]Why only for a few decades? ‘In the early 1950s,’ explains Mifsud,the person in charge of archaeological surveys in Malta, J. D. Evans, definedthe Maltese Neolithic … as the start of Malta’s history, at the same time thathe discarded the taurodont molars as unreliable evidence on the basis of theirisolation. Three years later, in 1962, a Maltese dental surgeon, J. J. Mangion,reported upon the incidence of taurodontism in modern Maltese, and thus seemedto discredit the validity of the Ghar Dalam molars as diagnostic … evidence forNeanderthal humans.But, as Mifsud says, the coup de grace was delivered in 1964, when a report fromMalta’s Museum of Archaeology misrepresented the results of chemical datingtests carried out on the taurodonts by claiming them to be Neolithic. Within adecade Neanderthal man was out of the Malta history books and the taurodontswere totally discredited as evidence for a Palaeolithic presence in the Malteseislands.36 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn36]TRUMP AND EVANS ON THE RECORD ON THE TAURODONTSBefore we look into the grave charge of misrepresentation that Mifsud is lodginghere, and find out whether the claim of taurodont teeth amongst the modernMaltese is as significant as Evans made it out to be, let’s clarify the‘official’ position on the taurodont controversy today.In addition to J. D. Evans’ comprehensive 1971 survey, The PrehistoricAntiquities of the Maltese Islands, which still forms the foundation for allorthodox teaching about Malta, an important channel through which the voice oforthodox Maltese archaeology reaches the general public is David Trump’s highlyregarded Archaeological Guide – most recently updated in March 2000.37[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn37] On page 91 of this updatededition Trump gives the visitor helpful information about the Hippotamus Layerand the Cervus Layer of the Ghar Dalam cave and then concludes: ‘No trace ofhuman occupation has been found in either of these levels.’38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn38] Interestingly, however, Trumpthen directs the reader to: ‘see below’.39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn39]What he actually says ‘below’ is framed as an attack on Mifsud’s investigationsin Dossier Malta that reopened the taurodont controversy in 1997 -althoughMifsud is not acknowledged by name. Trump begins his statement on page 92: ‘Twohuman teeth gave rise to much controversy, which has recently been reopened. Forpresent purposes I hold to the former version, but see p. 19.’40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn40] On page 19 we find a passage inwhich Trump appears to be hedging his bets, ever so slightly, on the dogma thatthere was no human presence in Malta before 5200 BC:There is very little to suggest that man reached the islands until somethinglike 7000 years ago, and nothing secure … though there is always at least afaint possibility that material of the Old Stone Age [i.e. the Palaeolithic] mayyet come to light …41 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn41]We then turn back to page 92, where Trump continues that the two Ghar Dalamteeth:were of taurodont form, with a single large hollow root, found commonly inNeanderthal man. But this form is known, if rarely, in modern man too – one wasextracted from the jaw of a living Maltese only a few years ago – and so doesnot prove the presence of Neanderthalers here. Careful chemical analysis at theBritish Museum (Natural History)… confirmed that these teeth were contemporarywith the bones of domestic animals, more recent than the deer bones and muchmore recent than the fossil fauna. It was similar analysis which suggested thatthe hippopotamus tooth implicated in the Piltdown forgery probably came from thesame site.42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn42]It is also worth reminding ourselves of Evans’ position on the taurodont matteras he set it out in his Prehistoric Antiquities - although this, of course,refers to the earlier episode of the controversy in which Despott had proposedthat the teeth ‘could be used as evidence of the presence of man in Malta duringthe Middle Palaeolithic period’.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn43] Evans replies that thesuggestion does not fit the facts:Dr Baldacchino has since pointed out that taurodontism occurs in teethdefinitely assignable to the Neolithic period of Malta (for instance, some fromthe Hypogeum). The two teeth from Ghar Dalam, therefore, could quite easilybelong to a later period. A few other human teeth and bones which have beenfound at depths of up to 6 ft (1.80 m) all appear to be of the modern type. Inview of these facts, then, the two taurodontic molars can hardly be accepted asgood evidence for the existence of man in the Maltese islands in pre-Neolithictimes.44 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn44]Earlier on the same page, while reporting the 1917 discovery of the Ghar Dalamteeth, Evans describes them as: ‘two very large human molars, both exhibitingthe characteristic of taurodontism, or fusion of the roots’.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn45]TRUTH AND FICTION (1)It is disturbing that, in the passage cited above, Evans wrongly equatestaurodontism, a condition in which the tooth either has extremely small roots orno noticeable roots at all, and in which the pulp cavity of the tooth iscorrespondingly enlarged, with an entirely different condition known as ‘fused’roots.46 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn46] This is a mistake ofsome significance, Mifsud reminds us:For while the condition of fused roots was commonly found in Neolithic and inmodern man, taurodontism was not. Hence the reason [i.e. confusion of fusedroots with taurodontism] for Evans’ assertion further down the same page thattaurodontism was described by Baldacchino as being common in Neolithic teeth:‘Dr Baldacchino has since pointed out that taurodontism occurs in teethdefinitely assignable to the Neolithic period for Malta (for instance, some fromthe Hypogeum).’47 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn47]But is Evans’ confusion genuine? Or is it sleight of hand to persuade us thatthe possibly very ancient human teeth from Malta – said on the basis of theirtaurodontism to be Palaeolithic – are not after all diagnostic of thePalaeolithic because the same taurodontic morphology ‘occurs in teeth definitelyassignable to the Neolithic period for Malta’?If it is not sleight of hand then it is bad scholarship. For no taurodonticteeth have ever been recovered from the Hypogeum. And although Evans might havebeen confused, Baldacchino himself knew very well how to distinguishtaurodontism from fused roots. After studying the thousands of teeth in theNeolithic deposit from the Burmeghez burial cave he wrote:No trace of taurodontism was found in these specimens; the only form ofdegeneration which was present was that with which we are familiar in modernteeth -fusion and maldevelopment of the roots, particularly in those of thethird or ‘wisdom’ molars.48 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn48]Another less ambiguous and more annoying example of prestidigitation that Mifsuddraws attention to concerns Evans’ misrepresentation of the position of theBritish archaeologist Gertrude Caton-Thompson on the subject of the Palaeolithicin Malta with specific reference to the two taurodont molars that had beendiscovered in Ghar Dalam in 1917. Here, writing in 1925, is what Caton-Thompsonactually said:The discovery of possible Palaeolithic man appeared to me of considerableimportance to prehistory … Apart from the discovery in the red earth of the twotaurodont teeth, in circumstances incapable of satisfactory interpretation,there are but two other records in the island of possible relics of Palaeolithicman.49 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn49]In this passage there can be no doubt that Caton-Thompson is treating thetaurodont teeth – along with the two ‘other records’ she mentions – as ‘possiblerelics of Palaeolithic man’. Moreover, when she says that they were found in‘circumstances incapable of satisfactory interpretation’ she means that theycannot be satisfactorily interpreted within a Neolithic framework.50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn50]But this is not what Evans has her saying in his Prehistoric Antiquities. It’sthere, discussing the 1917 taurodonts on page 19, where he argues that ‘theteeth from Ghar Dalam could … quite easily belong to a later period …’ He thenreinforces this point with a footnote in which the reader is informed: ‘MissCaton-Thompson remarks that that the discovery of the molars was made “incircumstances incapable of satisfactory interpretation”.’Thus, by smoke and mirrors, we are led to believe that the taurodonts were notfound in a good Palaeolithic context, whereas Caton-Thompson herself hadoriginally stated almost the opposite. As Mifsud puts it:Evans … misinterpreted Caton-Thompson when he extracted one phrase of hers outof its context and quoted it in another; he thus created the impression thevalidity of the molars was being questioned by her as archaeological evidence,whereas the contrary is correct … Evans’ inaccuracies were perpetuated throughrepetition by later authors … who have accepted Evans on the weight of hisauthority … including anatomists, archaeologists, medical historians, and otherhistorians, until errors crystallized into accepted facts.51[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn51]TRUTH AND FICTION (2)But Mifsud has much bigger game in his sights than scholars misrepresenting oneanother. What he’s really after lies in the interpretation that Trump and otherarchaeologists have subsequently put on the ‘careful chemical analysis’undertaken at the Museum of Natural History in London. This is the analysiswhich supposedly confirms that the Ghar Dalam taurodont teeth were notcontemporary with the Cervus (Deer) Layer in which they had been found but, onthe contrary, were ‘more recent than the deer bones’. Such an interpretation,Mifsud demonstrates, though honestly held, is quite unjustified. Because,although they have only ever been published in a highly abridged form – whichdoes lend itself strongly to the erroneous interpretation innocently put on themby others – the Natural History Museum tests did not confirm the Ghar Dhalamteeth to be ‘more recent’ than the Cervus Layer of deer bones washed into thecave in a cataclysmic flood of the late Palaeolithic between 18,000 and 12,000years ago. On the contrary, as we shall see, the results of the tests are highlyambiguous. Nevertheless, to the extent that any interpretation can legitimatelybe put on them at all, these results suggest much more strongly that the humanteeth are contemporary with the Cervus Layer – and thus in every sense part ofthe ancient Ice Age deposit.We will look into this in more detail in a moment. Meanwhile, although thiserror has very large ramifications for our views about when humans first settledin Malta, I want to make it absolutely clear here, in the plainest possiblelanguage, that David Trump is not to blame for it in any way. As he told us whenSharif interviewed him in October 2001 he himself is not a chemist and he hadtherefore relied on the proper authority for the opinion he had expressed in themost recent edition of his Archaeological Guide. That authority had been noneother than the Natural History Museum’s Kenneth Oakley, celebrated in the 1950sfor his uncovering of the Piltdown Man hoax, and the top scientist in his fieldat the time:Sharif: First of all, I’d like to get your general opinion on the work of AntonMifsud and colleagues who, particularly in the book Dossier Malta, have allegedthat the orthodox view of Neolithic being the earliest habitation of Malta isfirstly wrong and secondly based on gerrymandered evidence. What’s your generalopinion about that?Trump: That on a matter such as this I trust Dr Kenneth Oakley and his followersfar more than I trust Dr Anton Mifsud.Sharif: OK, so by referring to Oakley you’re specifically referring to the samechemical tests carried out at the Natural History Museum in London that Mifsudreported upon at length in Dossier Malta?Trump: Yes.Sharif: Have you read Dossier Malta? Trump: Yes.Sharif: And so you’re aware of all the specific allegations and claims?Trump: Yes.Sharif: And you don’t accept Mifsud’s evidence and allegations particularlyregarding the chemical tests.Trump: Frankly, no. I’m not a chemist, I can’t give an expert opinion on thedetails of this. But I certainly trust Dr Kenneth Oakley much further than Itrust Dr Anton Mifsud in his arguments.Sharif: I’d also like to ask you, do you accept any of the claims in DossierMalta about humans being there before the Neolithic? Is any of that likely orplausible?Trump: The latest evidence suggests that it would have been much easier than wehad allowed for Palaeolithic humans to have reached Malta. But, and it’s a verybig but, we have no evidence whatsoever that they actually did. I’m quiteprepared to believe it’s possible. If evidence were advanced I would give it allconsideration. I would certainly not rule it out of court out of hand. To mymind, no reliable evidence has yet been advanced …Sharif: To come back to the tests done at the Natural History Museum: In yourown Archaeological Guide - there’s an updated edition from March 2000 – yourefer to them as a ‘careful chemical analysis’ and state that this analysisconfirms that the Ghar Dalam taurodont teeth were not contemporary with theCervus Layer.Trump: These are the Oakley analyses.Sharif: Yes. Can I ask, what was your source for that view, that the human teethand the deer samples are not contemporary?Trump: Yes, well the stratigraphic evidence such as it was – there was a certainamount of disturbance there – that there were three layers of interest in thecave. The lower one with your pigmy hippopotamus, elephant, etc. – no evidencewhatsoever of human activity. Layer two, with the deer bones – still noconfirmed human activity there. And then the upper level, which was largelymixed, with everything from Neolithic down to modern all jumbled up.Sharif: Sure, I understand that. My question is specifically what was theacademic source …Trump: … for the analyses? Now, if I remember rightly, the first test donesuggested that the teeth could have been contemporary with the deer bones atleast – not with anything earlier. But the – I’m speaking from memory here …Sharif: Sure, I accept that.Trump: … further tests were done which, if not categorically disproving,strongly suggested that the teeth belonged with that uppermost level -could beas early as Neolithic, but not as early as the deer bones.Sharif: OK, now, as far as I know, there are only two places that give theseresults. One is a review – a summary – in the 1964 Museum Scientific Report,which quotes a letter from Oakley, that’s a 1964 source – is it that which youused to actually know what the results were?Trump: No, it was personal communication from Kenneth Oakley himself.Sharif: Oh, so did he give you a full list of the chemical results or just asummary?Trump: No, he just discussed them in general terms.REMEMBER THE ‘MISSING LINK’?There will always be some archaeologists who behave as though they areomniscient about prehistory. But though it has been said that Piltdown Man couldnever happen again, the amazing success and longevity of this extraordinary hoax– which began in 1912 and was not exposed until 1953 – is a reminder that whenthings do go wrong in the study of any area of the past they can go very wrongindeed. In the Piltdown case a false and (with hindsight) obviously absurd ideaabout the sequence of human evolution was sustained for forty years because itfitted in with the deep-seated prejudices and preconceptions of the BritishEmpire (the Piltdown skull – claimed to be that of the ‘missing link’ betweenapes and men – was, naturally, British!). For the entire period until it wasunmasked this counterfeited skull enjoyed all the prestige of a full scientificclassification (Eoanthropus dawsoni – literally ‘Dawn Man, found by Dawson’) andpride of place in a display case in the Natural History Museum in London. SoPiltdown was an embarrassing episode. And although, to their credit, the fraudthat had taken in scientists for so long was also exposed by scientists, the neteffect was to shake the public’s confidence in the infallibility of science andof scientific judgement.Here are the rudiments of the story, which is little spoken of today:Fossilized fragments of cranium and jawbone were found [in 1912] by CharlesDawson in a gravel formation at Barkham Manor, on Piltdown Common, near Lewes,England. Together with these were fossil remains of extinct animals, whichsuggested an early Pleistocene age for the site … In 1953 and 1954, as anoutcome of later discoveries of fossil man and intensive re-examination, theremains were shown to be skilfully disguised fragments of a quite modern humancranium and an ape (orang-utan) jaw fraudulently introduced into the shallowgravels … The animal bones were found to be genuine remains of extinct species,but they were not of British provenance … The eventual exposure of the fraudclarified the sequence of human evolution by removing the greatest anomaly inthe fossil record. At the same time, a series of valuable new tests weredeveloped for palaeontological study.52[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn52]And here are the connections with Ghar Dalam: 1. Amongst the remains of extinct animal species that the hoaxer had introduced into the Piltdown gravel in order to give authentic Pleistocene ‘context’ to the skull was a hippopotamus tooth. It is now thought that this tooth had come from Ghar Dalam.53 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn53] 2. The same ‘valuable new tests’ which proved that the different fragments of bone assembled in the Piltdown skull were not contemporaneous with one another or with the animal remains introduced into the gravel were also run on the Ghar Dalam taurodont teeth in 1952 [the ‘careful chemical analysis’ referred to earlier by Trump] and suggested very strongly that they were contemporary with the deer remains in the cave’s Cervus Layer.54 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn54]Or, to put it another way, the very tests that were accurate enough to provePiltdown Man young and a fraud indicated that the Ghar Dalam taurodonts must beold and genuine.BEYOND TRUTH AND FICTIONBut if the Ghar Dalam taurodonts are genuine then why aren’t we told this inEvans’ Prehistoric Antiquities, the canonical text of Maltese archaeology thatwas published almost twenty years after the results of the 1952 tests wereknown? Or was Evans correct in 1971 when he promulgated the dogma that ‘the twotaurodontic molars can hardly be accepted as good evidence for the existence ofman in the Maltese islands in pre-Neolithic times’?55[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn55]Anton Mifsud’s approach to this investigation was to set aside allpreconceptions and prejudices – both his own and those of the archaeologists –about whether or not Malta could have been inhabited by humans in pre-Neolithictimes. He took the view, consistent with his personal philosophy, that all thatshould matter, and be weighed up, were empirically verifiable facts. In the caseof the Ghar Dalam taurodonts the ‘best’ facts (i.e., those that most clearlyspeak for themselves without requiring interpretation) fall into two categories,both of which are well understood by archaeologists.On the one hand there is the superb stratigraphy of the site – the distinctlayers of deposits laid down one on top of the other at different times.Archaeologists all over the world routinely derive dates and sequences of datesfrom stratigraphy such as this. And, indeed stratigraphically, the human remainsat Ghar Dalam lie contemporaneously with Pleistocene red deer and other extinctfauna in the deer layer’.56 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn56]Secure stratigraphy on its own should have been enough to confirm the presenceof Palaeolithic man on Malta. From the beginning, however, J. D. Evans would notaccept the obvious implications, raising the objection that the teeth must beintrusive. So the question now, as Mifsud explains, is not whether the teethwere really found in the Deer Layer – because they certainly were -but whetherthey were there as a result of ‘an intrusive later burial by Neolithic humans,or else an actual deposit of the remains of Palaeolithic humans together withthe remains of the deer layer fauna during the late Pleistocene’.57[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn57] And in order to answer thatquestion stratigraphy on its own, no matter how good, is not enough. What’sneeded is the record of the scientific tests that were done on the Ghar Dalamteeth in 1952 at the Natural History Museum in London.Mifsud travelled to London and, after some detective work, managed to find theoriginal records in the vaults of the Natural History Museum. To make sense ofthem we first need to know more about the so-called FUN (Flourine, Uranium,Nitrogen) tests that the Museum conducted on the Ghar Dalam teeth in 1952.OAKLEY’S FUNAlthough some of them had a long prior history, the FUN tests had been modifiedand developed by the British palaeontologist Kenneth Page Oakley of the NaturalHistory Museum, apparently with the specific intention of confirming or denyingthe antiquity of the Piltdown skull.58[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn58] But it is a little-known fact,now clarified by Anton Mifsud’s research, that these tests were first applied in1952 to human and animal remains from Ghar Dalam (and also, as we shall see,from the Hypogeum in Malta) – i.e., a year before the same tests were used withsuch devastating effect on the Piltdown skull in 1953. Mifsud notes that Oakley‘was in Malta on several occasions, on holiday, and as the guest of (the Maltesepalaeontologist and geologist) George Zammit Maempel, with whom he shared commonscientific interests’.59 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn59]In assessing the Piltdown skull, Oakley began by measuring the concentrations offluorine. The surprise, notes Mifsud, was that:The skull and the jaw gave readings that set them wide apart in time by severaltens of millennia. The other scientific tests, including Nitrogen [and] UraniumOxide … confirmed the hoax … Pursuing the matter further Oakley then sought theorigins of the associated remains of the Piltdown assembly. The hippopotamusmolar gave a low fluorine reading which immediately suggested its source from aMediterranean limestone cave, such as a Maltese one, typically Ghar Dalam. Testson Ghar Dalam hippo molars confirmed the suspicion.Malta thus became involved and this led to the performance of the samerepertoire of chemical tests on the other finds at Ghar Dalam … These chemicaltests had by this time established themselves as the most reliable indices forthe purposes of relative dating of archaeological specimens elevated from thesame horizon …60 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn60]So the tests that were conducted on the Ghar Dhalam teeth and other materialfrom the Deer Layer were the best and most appropriate tools available in the1950s for settling what is indeed ‘the basic question’ of the taurodontcontroversy: were the human teeth deposited in the Deer Layer at the same timeas the rest of the layer was laid down, i.e., between 18,000 and 10,000 yearsago, or were they introduced into it later than 7200 years ago in the form of aburial by the Neolithic people responsible for the Cultural Layer?Here are the bare minimum of details about the tests necessary to understand theresults:FLOURINE AND URANIUMThese two tests work because after death and excarnation the bones and teeth ofanimals and humans deposited together in the same environment – as well as suchsubstances as deer antler – absorb fluorine and uranium from their surroundings.From environment to environment the supply of fluorine and uranium changes – theless there is, the less the bones, teeth and antlers can absorb, and vice versa– but within any given context the rate of absorption of the available localfluorine and/or uranium will be the same for any bones, teeth and antlersdeposited there. Thus ‘the estimation of fluorine confirms or refutescontemporaneity of bones and teeth in the same horizon’.61[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn61]Example: if human teeth and deer bones and/or antlers are excavated from thesame stratum (‘horizon’ in archaeology-speak), and if the teeth prove on testingto contain much lower levels of fluorine or much lower levels of uranium (ormuch lower levels of both) than the deer remains, then the implication would bethat the teeth must be much younger than the deer remains and are thus intrusiveto the horizon. If, however, the environment is one known for its particularlylow levels of natural fluorine, such as limestone cave-systems like Ghar Dalam,then the fluorine test obviously becomes less useful the lower the local levelof fluorine is – and of no use at all once that level reaches zero. But withthis proviso, and with the passage of time:Both elements accumulate in greater amounts. When bones are buried in differentlevels at the same location, older bones positioned in lower levels show greateramounts of fluorine and uranium than do those positioned above them. Theaccumulation of both elements is dependent on time and water-action present atthe location. In view of the low concentrations involved, fluorine estimationmay not be ideal for limestone environments, but once measurable amounts arepresent conditions are more suitable than if the percolating water is saturatedwith the mineral.Levels of uranium oxide in modern bone are practically nil, but in ancientburied bone these may rise as high as 1000 ppm [parts per million] depending onthe concentration of uranium oxide in percolating water. Aitken gives the rangein fossil bone as lying between 1 and 1000 ppm. Trace amounts of fluorine arepresent in modern bone, ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 per cent in human bone, from0.024 to 0.07 per cent in adult dentine of tooth, and between 0.02 to 0.1percent in Red Deer bone. Thus the maximum ever in modern specimens of tooth andbone in man and deer is 0.1 percent.62[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn62]NITROGENThis test works the opposite way round from the other two. Unlike fluorine anduranium, which can only begin to accumulate from the surrounding soil and itspercolating water after the death and burial of the organism, nitrogen isaccumulated in bones and teeth etc. only during life and then begins todissipate. Thus after death the general rule is that ‘nitrogen decreases withincreasing bone age’:63 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn63]Bone and teeth contain a certain percentage of nitrogen, averaging 3.4 per centin teeth and 4 to 5 per cent in bone. Following death and burial organic remainslose their nitrogen with time, once the requirements of its breakdown areavailable. These include the absence of glacial conditions, an alkaline medium,absence of surrounding clay, and the presence of a specific bacterium, theClostridium histolyticum …64 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn64]Example: if human teeth and deer bones and/or antlers are excavated from thesame horizon and if the teeth prove on testing to contain much higher levels ofnitrogen than the deer remains, then the implications would be that the teethmust be much younger than the deer remains and are thus intrusive to thehorizon. The provisos, however, are many: if the environment lacks the bacteriumnecessary for nitrogen breakdown, or is glaciated, or surrounded by clay, thennitrogen is retained in any buried teeth and bones and the depletion of nitrogenbecomes less useful as a test of relative antiquity.‘In effect, therefore,’ Mifsud concludes,a low nitrogen is useful to indicate antiquity, whereas a high nitrogen is notsignificant unless it is associated with a low fluorine and uranium oxide, whichwill definitely indicate a recent specimen. Conversely, the presence of a lowfluorine and uranium oxide is not significant in the presence of a low nitrogen,for there are factors which impede fluorine and uranium oxide uptake,particularly in limestone caves of which Ghar Dalam is one. On the other hand ahigh fluorine and uranium oxide is significant in reflecting antiquity.65[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn65]POLITICS AND AMBITIONMifsud’s view is that the results of the 1952 FUN tests on the Ghar Dalam teethgot caught up in a number of matters incidental to the proper concerns ofarchaeology that made it expedient for them either to be ignored, or betterstill discredited, as evidence of a Palaeolithic human presence on Malta. Ofthese the two most important were local politics on the one hand and theacademic ambitions of the late Professor J. D. Evans on the other.As to politics, Malta in the early 1950s was pursuing an integrationist policywith Britain. Absurd as it seems now there was embarrassment in official circlesthat the taurodont teeth might prove the modern Maltese to be directly descendedfrom primitive Neanderthal ancestors (although, as we’ve seen, taurodontic teethon their own, even specimens as large as the Ghar Dalam molars, do notnecessarily prove that the original owners of those teeth were Neanderthals,since the condition still exists to varying degrees in modern, non-Neanderthalhumans today).As to the second matter, Mifsud notes that J. D. Evans had graduated fromCambridge in 1949 and that in the early 1950s he was ‘in desperate need of aPhD’.66 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn66] The thesis that thefuture Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at the University of London chose todevelop, influenced by the Italian archaeologist Barnarbo Brea, was that thevery first human inhabitants of the previously unpeopled Malta had beenimmigrants from the Neolithic Stentinello culture of Sicily – a theory that isstill part of the conventional academic wisdom about Malta today. In pursuingthis thesis, Mifsud suggests, it was not convenient to the young Evans to haveto deal with the evidence of the Ghar Dalam teeth that suggested a prior,Palaeolithic, human presence in Malta.This, then, either as a conscious or unconscious motive, could explain why Evanswas so vehement in his attacks on the antiquity of the taurodonts and soeconomical with the truth in his published statements about them. He wanted themout of the way – permanently – of his own theory about Malta’s firstinhabitants.A TALE OF TWO MUSEUMSTo get to see the records of the 1952 tests Anton Mifsud at first expected thathe would need to travel no further than the distance from his own home to theValletta headquarters of the National Museum – on behalf of which the NaturalHistory Museum in London had carried out the tests in 1952.This turned out to be rather a naive expectation. But what Mifsud did discoverin Valletta was that:On 3 March 1952 Dr J. G. Baldacchino registered the sampling of the taurodontmolar discovered by Despott in 1917. Other remains from Ghar Dalam cave includedanother tooth which was picked up by Caton-Thompson in 1924, a taurodont molarelevated by Baldacchino in 1936, and one sample each of a hippo molar and deerlongbone. There is no record in the Museum of Archaeology Reports [for 1952/3]of these tests being carried out.67[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn67]At this point Mifsud flew to London, where he found, to his relief that:The Green Book at the Museum of Natural History is still available and containsthe original readings of the entire repertoire of tests carried out between 1952and 1968/9 on the ‘Malta Samples’. Two teeth from the Hypogeum were alsoincluded.The five human teeth submitted to the Natural History museum were thereforeCaton-Thompson’s (Ma.1), Despott’s (Ma.2), Baldacchino’s (Ma.7) and two molarsfrom the Hypogeum (Ma.5 and 6).The results in the Green Book were not what Mifsud expected. The fluorine testfor Despott’s molar (Ma.2) gave the highest results of all the samples tested,including the Pleistocene deer and hippo samples. This result did not jibe withthe official position that the ‘careful chemical tests’ had proven the tooth tobe Neolithic. The nitrogen result for Despott’s molar was 1.85 per cent. Were itnot for the fluorine readings, this result would have been compatible with theofficial position. But as it stands, the disparity revealed in the Green Bookonly suggests that either the fluorine tests or the nitrogen tests – or both –were unreliable. The official position should therefore have been that theresults for this tooth were internally inconsistent and hence ambiguous.Baldacchino’s molar gave very similar nitrogen results to the two hippo molarsfrom Ghar Dalam (0.44 per cent compared with 0.4 per cent for the hippos),clearly suggesting contemporaneity between the human samples and the Pleistoceneanimal samples in the Cervus Layer. Again, this result is incompatible with theofficial claim that these chemical tests proved the human teeth in the CervusLayer to be Neolithic intrusions.The tooth Ma. I was discovered in the mid-1920s by Gertrude Caton-Thompson, theBritish archaeologist cited earlier whose views were misinterpreted by Evans.According to Caton-Thompson’s notes, it was found in an ‘unstratified layer’ inthe company of hippo, horse, deer, thirty potsherds and the end of a flintblade. This tooth yielded fluorine results (0.2 and 0.3) equivalent to those ofthe Pleistocene deer samples (0.25 and 0.3). It also yielded similar nitrogenresults to Baldacchino’s molar, with two different tests yielding results of0.39 per cent and 0.79 per cent. That the same tooth yielded such differentresults highlights the unreliability of the nitrogen testing in a similar mannerto the fluorine-nitrogen inconsistency of Ma.2. Nevertheless, these nitrogenresults overlap with the readings for the Pleistocene hippo samples (0.4 percent), and further raise the possibility of a Pleistocene date. This isespecially interesting because the tooth bore no signs of taurodontism, andmight therefore be taken as evidence of a Palaeolithic presence of humans onMalta who had normal, non-taurodontic teeth.It is worth noting here that another non-taurodontic tooth was discovered inGhar Dalam in the 1920s, this time by George Sinclair, a civil engineer with theBritish Admiralty. The tooth was buried almost a metre deeper than Despott’s1917 molar,68 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn68] and it isunfortunate that it was not also submitted for chemical testing.Ma. 6, a human tooth from the Hypogeum, gave a nitrogen reading of nil. If wewere to base everything on Oakley’s nitrogen test, we would have to concludethat the owner of this tooth was alive way back into the Palaeolithic. However,it must be pointed out that Mifsud later managed to get this tooth carbon-datedthrough the Natural History Museum. As noted in chapter 17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c17_r1.htm#c17], the carbon-date put the tooth into theLate Tarxien phase, around 2200 BC. Along with the inconsistencies noted forMa.1 and Ma.2, this further highlights just how unreliable Oakley’s nitrogendating technique can be.THE 1964 REPORT: ERASING THE PALAEOLITHIC PERILNo official record of the chemical testing was published until the Museum ofArchaeology’s 1964 report – a decade after the nitrogen and fluorine results hadbeen achieved. During this lengthy hiatus only a very small number of peopleknew that the 1950s tests had ever been carried out at all and even fewer couldhave been aware of their results.Such a delay in the publication of important modern dating evidence confirming aPalaeolithic human presence in Malta is plainly odd in itself. But that the gistof the evidence should subsequently have been misrepresented by the omission ofcrucial data when publication finally came about is far more extraordinary.Moreover, Mifsud believes the timing of publication in 1964 was not accidental.In that year there was already a dating furore in the air following thediscovery that C-14 underestimates the age of materials that are more than about3000 years old – and that there is a progressively larger underestimation theolder the sample is. By 1964 this ‘built-in’ error had been accuratelycalibrated millennium-by-millennium by means of ‘dendochronology’ (comparisonwith the annual ring counts of very ancient species of trees). The implicationsof the new ‘calibrated’ dates for Malta were that the entire Temple Periodsuddenly had to be shifted a full millennium back in time. For example, before1964 Gigantija was thought to be no older than 2500 BC; after 1964 and ‘thetree-ring revolution’ the date was pushed back to the presently accepted figureof 3600 BC.69 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn69]It is interesting to note that Evans was very slow to accept the implications ofdendochronology for his carefully worked-out sequence for the Temple Period (thebeginning of which he had hitherto set at 2500 BC) – and even as late as 1971 hewas still refusing to let go entirely of his pre-calibration scheme.70[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn70] But the tree-ring revolution wasan irresistible force, like a rising tide – with implications forradiocarbon-dates all around the world – and even Evans in the role of KingCanute could not hold back the waves.The FUN tests in the 1950s were quite a different matter, done behind closeddoors, strictly between the Natural History Museum in London and the NationalMuseum in Malta. By 1964 the extremely annoying and inconvenient results ofthese tests had been withheld from the public for ten years with no one else anythe wiser. Accordingly, there was no basis for protest when the National Museumpublished an abridged and unfortunately highly misleading version of the resultsin its 1964 Scientific Report. Whether by accident or by design, the net effectwas that only information which supported the Evans paradigm was available onthe public record.The relevant passage from the 1964 Scientific Report itself reads as follows:Considerable help has been received from foreign experts in the analysis ofMaltese material of various sorts.Dr K. P. Oakley of the British Museum, Natural History, analysed a number ofbone samples for their collagen content, expressed as a percentage of nitrogen.The figures obtained were – hippopotamus bone, nil; deer antler 0.13 per cent;normal human tooth 0.7 per cent; taurodont human tooth (these four all from GharDalam) 1.85 per cent … This proves conclusively that the taurodont tooth islater than the material from the other prehistoric sites, and so cannot possiblybe of Neanderthal man.71 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn71]This statement contains paradoxes which seem all the more bizarre because theyare left unacknowledged.Firstly, the report only makes a conclusion about one human taurodont -Despott’smolar classified as Ma.2 – and yet, as we’ve seen, Trump has used the results ofthese ‘careful chemical tests’ to draw a conclusion about two different GharDalam taurodonts.Secondly, why were the obvious inconsistencies in the data ignored?Caton-Thompson’s molar is reported as having a nitrogen reading of 0.7 per cent,when in fact, according to the Green Book, it yielded the two very differentresults of 0.39 per cent and 0.79 per cent. More importantly, why did the reportprovide only the nitrogen reading for Despott’s molar, and ignore thecontradictory fluorine result? The nitrogen test had already proved itselfcapable of producing variable and hence unreliable results, so why was it givenautomatic and exclusive preference over the fluorine results?Thirdly, if the nitrogen content of 1.85 per cent is supposed to be appropriateto the Neolithic, as we are effectively being told here, then does it not followthat the reported reading of 0.7 per cent from the normal human tooth from GharDalam is indicative of a much older, pre-Neolithic date? And what does it sayabout Baldacchino’s molar, which gave a nitrogen percentage of 0.44 per cent?The results published in the 1964 Report misrepresent the actual set of resultsrecorded in the Green Book in London. Had the complete set of results beenincluded, or properly summarized, then it would have been clear that the resultswere to a large extent ambiguous, but also suggestive of a Palaeolithic humanpresence on Malta.This misrepresentation of the actual results of the 1950s tests has subsequentlyhad a pivotal effect on public perceptions of Maltese prehistory and on whatuniversity archaeology departments do and do not see as valid and worthwhileresearch on Malta. Unedited, the results from the chemical tests might haveinspired a new generation of archaeologists to break away from J. D. Evans’1950s ‘Neolithic’ paradigm and pay more attention to the possibility of mucholder relics around the Maltese islands – even underwater. But in the distortedform in which the results finally reached the public in 1964 (a mere decadeafter the tests had been carried out) there could be no danger that they woulddo any such thing.Let’s note in passing that seven years after the tests – and five before themisrepresented test results were first put on the public record in the Museum ofArchaeology’s 1964 Report – J. D. Evans had begun to talk as though conclusiveresults were already on the record. Here are three characteristic passages fromhis Malta (1959):There are as yet no trustworthy traces of the presence of man in Malta beforethe Neolithic period …We have no reliable evidence that any of them [Palaeolithic humans] made theirhomes in Malta …We have no reason to suppose that Palaeolithic man ever set foot on Malta.72[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn72]‘The logic of Evans’ conclusions’, comments Mifsud, ‘was founded on falsepremises and a significant iota of misrepresentation … The weight of authorityestablished his hypothesis as semi-dogma; the consequence was bad history.’73[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn73]THE URANIUM CONTROLWe’ve seen that the fluorine and nitrogen results for Despott’s molar (Ma.2)contradicted each other. The former suggested a Palaeolithic date, whereas thelatter – the one which was published – suggested a Neolithic date. But a thirdtest was later carried out on Despott’s molar that had not been carried out onthe other two teeth in 1952. This was the uranium oxide assay – a moresophisticated procedure which was not yet fully established in 1952 and whichwas only applied to Despott’s molar in 1968. This later test took place, Mifsudhas discovered, at the specific request of Kenneth Oakley – who also asked thatit be carried out on Baldacchino’s (1936) taurodont molar at the same time.74[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn74]The uranium oxide result for Despott’s molar supported the flourine result andembarrassingly contradicted the high nitrogen result that had been published inthe Museum’s Scientific Report in 1964 as proof that the tooth was Neolithic.The result of the uranium assay was 13 ppm, compared with 0.1 ppm or less inliving bone and levels of between 4 and 12 ppm in various Pleistocene hippo anddeer samples from Ghar Dalam. Ghar Dalam is an environment with low levels ofuranium oxide (and fluorine) in the percolating water, so it is very hard to seehow Despott’s molar could have accumulated so much of it within just 7000 years.As Mifsud sums up:The dating to the Neolithic in the 1964 Report could not be sustained in theface of the 13 ppm reading … Despott’s molar has survived to tell its tale … Itsfluorine and uranium content ranks it contemporaneous with the fossil fauna ofthe Cervus Layer.75 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn75]As one might expect, knowing all the facts, this uranium oxide result was neverpublished. The problem posed by the chemical results to the Neolithic date offirst human settlement favoured by orthodox theory and confirmed in the 1964Report has been efficiently dealt with by archaeology by simply ignoring thedisturbing fluorine and uranium results whilst focusing only on a highlyselective group of results from unreliable nitrogen assays. In consequence,until Mifsud rooted them out from the pages of the Natural History Museum’sGreen Book and published them in Dossier Malta in 1997, neither the fluorine northe uranium levels of any of the Ghar Dalam teeth were known outside the narrowcircle of the two museums.‘ADJUSTMENTS’In Dossier Malta, Mifsud claimed that the inconsistency between the uranium andfluorine results on the one hand and the high nitrogen result on the other couldbe explained by forgery. He took photographs of the Green Book during his visitto the Natural History Museum and spotted that there appeared to be two layersof ink in the box containing the nitrogen result for Despott’s molar. The bottomlayer gave’. 8 per cent’ (i.e. 0.8 per cent, but without the zero). The toplayer, in a different shade of ink, added a 1 and 5 to this result to give ‘1.85per cent’.Anthony Frendo, Head of the Department of Archaeology at the University ofMalta, initially concluded that the nitrogen results published in the 1964Report effectively demolished any possibility that Palaeolithic humans had livedon Malta.76 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn76] But in what amountsto an extraordinary endorsement from the heart of the establishment, Frendoconcedes that Mifsud’s research has now shown those nitrogen results to havebeen ‘tampered with’ and the fluorine and uranium oxide tests suppressed so asto create a false Neolithic chronology for the human teeth from Ghar Dalam:77[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn77] ‘This means that early man musthave come to the Maltese islands in pre-Neolithic times.’78[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn78]How have other archaeologists reacted to Anton Mifsud’s accusation of forgeryand its seismic implications for the orthodox paradigm of the Neolithic originsof Maltese civilization? On the latter point there has simply been no reaction.Maltese prehistoric archaeology continues on its Neolithic way, seeminglyuntroubled. On the former point, like Frendo, John Samut Tagliaferro of Malta’sMuseum of Archaeology agrees that the final figure now to be seen in the GreenBook ‘of 1.85 per cent of nitrogen content for the molar Gh.D/2 (Despott’smolar, coded by the Natural History Museum as Ma.2] was superimposed on theoriginal result, namely that of 0.8 per cent’.79[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn79]Unlike Frendo, however, Tagliaferro says he sees nothing sinister in thesuperimposition. He argues that all the samples from Malta were subjected tomore than one nitrogen assay at the Natural History Musuem – and these sometimesproduced different results, quite properly leading to ‘adjustment’, after thesecond test, of the figures yielded by the first. In the case of Despott’s molarthe original figure had been written as ‘.8 per cent’ (with no zero precedingthe decimal point). The fact that this figure was then overwritten so that itwould read ‘1.85 per cent’ could be easily explained as the result of such an‘adjustment’ after retesting.80 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn80]I had already seen ample evidence that the chemical test results had beenmisrepresented and so was prepared to consider the possibility of forgery. But Ihad also seen enough to convince me that the chemical tests were capable inthemselves of producing inconsistent and ambiguous results. I was therefore notprepared to accept Mifsud’s allegation without following it up and offering theMuseum a chance to rebut it. I also wanted to see the Green Book for myself and,with the help of Channel 4 and permission from the Museum, get its data – whichwere obviously controversial even if one disregarded the forgery allegation – onfilm.TACKLING THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM (1): CONTROLLED ACCESSOur contacts with the Museum unfolded over a period of several months and werehandled primarily by my research assistant Sharif Sakr with occasional back-upwhen needed from Roy Ackerman, Head of Programmes at Diverse Productions (thecompany making my TV series for Channel 4). Here is the transcript of Sharif’sopening (11 July 2001) telephone conversation with an official (name withheld)who deals with access to records at the Museum’s Palaeontology Department:Sharif: Hi, my name is Sharif Sakr. I just spoke to a colleague of yours in thearchives department, and she recommended I speak to you. I’m calling fromDiverse Production, a TV company in London, and we’re making a documentarythat’s going to involve some Maltese prehistoric archaeology, and as part of theresearch and filming, I’d like to know if it’s possible for me to get access tothis thing called the ‘Green Book’, which contains records of bone analyses donebetween 1952 and, I guess, the late 1960s, on some Maltese teeth.Official: I don’t know if it’s possible or not.Sharif: You don’t know if it’s possible or not?Official: I don’t know if it’s possible, because it relates, it has informationabout human remains, and that would be available really only to academics –people who are doing academic research, such as, we’ve had people from Malta doresearch on that in here …Sharif: Really? People have already come to look at the stuff I’ve talked about?Official: Yeah, that’s right, Dr Anton Mifsud has looked at that book, but hewas an academic. But merely for the sake of filming – you know, what’s thepoint? What’s the use of that?Sharif: You know, to get the actual numbers on camera, if possible.Official: Erm … No … I think that will not be possible, basically, withoutpermission from a much higher level than me, basically.Sharif: Well, who would that be?Official: Well, a letter from your head of department or head of, whatever youare, to Dr Louise Humphrey here, who deals with access to human remains.Sharif: Do you have any contact details for her?Official: Yes, Dr Louise Humphrey, at the address of this museum, which is theNatural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW75BD.Sharif: OK, thank you. What about, well, cameramen aside, what about thepossibility of me, you know an individual without any cameras or anything,coming in to browse through this book?Official: Good heavens, no! No documentation relating to human remains isavailable for browsing by non-academics. I mean you’re not doing academicresearch, so you don’t get to see the documentation, it’s as simple as that.Sharif: OK, that’s quite clear.Official: That’s basically the rule that we’re following now, in relation to theanthropology collection.Sharif: And that rule exists for reasons of preservation or ethics?Official: For reasons of ethics, I guess, more than anything else.Sharif: What if I said that the samples I wanted to see weren’t solely human –in fact a number of them were hippopotamus bone …Official: Yes, but it’s documentation within the anthropology section. So itgets regarded as … er … and also it might be unpublished, even if it’s fiftyyears old, I’m not sure if the information’s been published or not. If it’s beenpublished, then why would you want to see the original notebooks where theresults are recorded?Sharif: Well I can answer that, because this man, I’ve never met him, but AntonMifsud is claiming that in fact the results have been ignored, i.e., notpublished, misrepresented when they were mentioned, and in fact he’s evenclaiming that there was some tampering going on, such that the only real placewhere you’re going to find these results in their original form from 1952 is inthe Green Book, and that’s why it’s so important to see that book, rather thansecondary evidence, for example in the National Museum in Malta.Official: Another thing that comes to mind is that, er, if the reputation of theMuseum is at stake, then probably the director of science would have to look atthis first, you know …Sharif: Well, it’s not at stake – your museum is supposed to have theuntampered-with evidence …Official: It’s just that you may misrepresent whatever we have, and that wouldmean that we get embroiled in all kinds of funny tests going on, about whetherit’s one pen or three pens or five pens on a piece of paper, whether it waswritten in 1950 or 1960 or 1970, which would go on and on for months and weeksand there’d be no end to it …Sharif: I was wondering … you talk as if you’ve had experience of Anton Mifsud …Official: Oh, I do …Sharif: Was he annoying, was he dishonest?Official: No, he was very pleasant, without a doubt. You know he was … Butperhaps what I would say is that erm, between, since then the whole climate inrelation to human remains has changed …Sharif: So it’s controlled access now …Official: It’s controlled access. The ethics of human remains.TACKLING THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM (2): ONE OF OUR PAGES IS MISSINGAs the official suggested, Sharif made contact with Dr Louise Humphreyconcerning our request to film the relevant page in the Green Book containingthe altered nitrogen figure for Despott’s molar (code number Ma.2). On 26October 2001, Dr Humphrey presented us with an astonishing piece of news. Wewould not be able to film the page containing this test result – or at any ratenot at the Natural History Museum – because it was ‘missing’.Ironically, the only place in the world where a true copy of it could now befound was in Anton Mifsud’s 1997 Dossier Malta where he had reproduced hisphotographs from the Green Book. Perhaps, Dr Humphrey suggested, we would liketo film his photographs instead? While we were at it, she added, could we pleaseask Dr Mifsud to send a photograph to her as well so that she could use it toreplace the missing page in the file?It was in this e-mail that Dr Humphrey offered the Museum’s rebuttal to Mifsud’sallegation of forgery. Humphrey had managed to find the original laboratoryreports from which the results had been taken and entered into the Green Book.These lab records contained a reading of 1.85 per cent for Ma.2, effectivelyproving Tagliaferro’s suggestion that this later result was genuine and a propersubstitute for the original figure of 0.8 per cent.From: Louise HumphreyTo: Sharif SakrSent: Friday, October 26, 2001 12:43 PMSubject: Green BookDear Mr SakrThank you for your e-mail of 18 October. The page listing results for Ma.1-Ma.7in the Green Book is missing and I have not been able to find any evidence forwhere it might be. We know that the page was still present in 1995 since DrMifsud states in the acknowledgements of his book that he photographed the pagewhen he visited this Museum on 10 August 1995. Fortunately, Dr Mifsud does havephotographs and, according to his acknowledgements, photocopies of the relevantpage of the Green Book. It would therefore be possible for you to film thesecopies for your programme. I would also be grateful if you could ask Dr Mifsudto send me a copy of his photographs, photocopies or both to replace the missingoriginal page in our files.Some of the results in the Green Book were compiled from other primary sources,for example, correspondence between Museum staff and staff in the laboratorieswhere the analyses were conducted or forms completed during the process ofanalyses conducted here. I have not found primary records to back up all of theresults summarized in the Green Book, and it is possible that some analysisresults were entered directly into the Green Book. The departmental archivesinclude two files of correspondence between Dr Oakley and staff atMicroanalytical Laboratory in Oxford where nitrogen determinations were carriedout, including letters detailing the results for all of the samples from Malta.For example, one letter, dated 17 June 1955, gives the analytical result forMa.2 (1.85% N). Dr Mifsud’s claim (e.g., page 96 of his book) that Dr Oakleydeliberately and fraudulently altered this result is evidently erroneous. Thedepartmental archives also include forms completed during the process of uraniumanalyses, including those for several Maltese samples. The analysis of Ma.2 wascarried out on 23 February 1967 and yielded a result of 13 +/- 1 [parts permillion].I should reiterate that each of the analytical techniques used to investigatethe samples from Malta between 1952 and 1969 can yield anomalous or ambiguousresults … Dr Oakley had many years experience working with these techniques andwas probably better qualified than anybody to interpret the results and identifyanomalies … Ma.6 is a very clear example of an anomalous result. The nitrogenreading is nil, indicating that the tooth had been buried for long enough forall the organic materials to be lost. Taken in isolation this result couldsuggest an early (e.g., Pleistocene) date, yet the radiocarbon date for thistooth is 4130 +/- 45 (see Archaeometry 41: 421–431).[NB Ma.6 is not one of the contested Ghar Dalam teeth but one of the Hypogeumteeth also assayed by Oakley. Mifsud’s theory does not dispute but in factpredicts the dating to the Neolithic of the Hypogeum teeth, which he believes tohave been swept into the underground structure from surface-level Neolithicgraveyards by the agency of a flood -see chapters 16 and 17.]Fluorine, uranium and nitrogen tests have fallen into disuse because morereliable and accurate dating techniques are now available. If the aim of yourprogramme is to provide accurate scientific information, it would not beappropriate to rely on unpublished information using out-of-date techniquestaken from historical archives. Results that are unpublished have not beensubmitted to peer review and do not carry the same weight scientifically asthose that have been scrutinized by independent reviewers. I understand fromyour e-mail that it may not be possible to remove samples from the Maltesetaurodont teeth for radiocarbon dating. Nevertheless, I think it is important topoint out that the dating of the human teeth is insecure without this additionalevidence. Kind regards, Louise HumphreyQUESTION-MARKS PERSISTHumphrey’s e-mail helps to answer some questions, but leaves others unansweredand raises yet more.On the forgery issue, Mifsud’s allegation as it stands is clearly weakened bythe proof that 1.85 per cent is a genuine test result. But does this necessarilymean that 0.8 per cent, written in the original layer of ink, wasn’t also agenuine result? 0.8 per cent would make much more sense given the results of thefluorine and uranium oxide tests. Dr Louise Humphrey made it clear to us in alater e-mail that if there was a lab report containing a nitrogen result of 0.8per cent for Ma.2, then she probably – but not definitely – would have found it.But it should also be pointed out that Anton Mifsud – who was kept informed ofour correspondence with the Natural History Museum – stands by his allegationand expects to publish further evidence to support it in 2003. He intends toprove that whereas Ma.2 was tested for fluorine in 1952, no sample was takenfrom this tooth for later nitrogen testing, such that the 1.85 per cent readingactually corresponds to a different tooth that was substituted by someone – andMifsud intends to show who – outside the Natural History Museum. It wasknowledge of this dishonest switch, thinks Mifsud, that led an honest andconcerned Kenneth Oakley to resubmit the original tooth for uranium oxidetesting in 1968.Forgery allegations aside, it is bizarre, and indeed rather disquieting, thatthe extremely important and controversial page from the Green Book containingresults which were misrepresented by scholars should have been present in 1995and should have gone ‘missing’ subsequently – without any trace or explanation,as Dr Humphrey admits. For whereas one might expect items of primary evidence to‘disappear’ during a mobster trial, it seems inappropriate for the same sort ofthing to happen in an archaeological dispute. Moreover, staff at the Museum areobviously well informed about the very serious allegations made in Dossier Maltain 1997. It therefore seems contrary to human nature that they would not at thattime have opened up the Green Book to have a look at the page Mifsud claimed hadbeen misrepresented and ‘corrupted’. If so, does it not follow either that thepage was still present in the Green Book in 1997 or – if it was found to be gonethen – that no report was made of its disappearance at the time?But the biggest question to arise from all of this concerns the chemical teststhemselves. If Oakley’s chemical tests on the Ghar Dalam teeth are really asobsolete and insecure as Dr Humphrey claims, why were they still being used in2000 to contradict the stratigraphic context of the teeth and demonstrate thatthey are Neolithic? And if the tests aren’t as useless as Dr Humphrey claims,can we really accept her assertion that only the late Kenneth Oakley wassufficiently versed in his own esoteric techniques to be able to interpret theirresults? If the orthodox position rests on nothing more than a missing page ofnumbers that have been subject to highly misrepresentative publication anddeeply unfathomable interpretation, then does this position deserve to beconsidered ‘scientific’?AN INTERPRETATION WITH FEET OF CLAYLet me reiterate that the real issue in this saga is not the allegation offorgery but the interpretation that has consistently been put by archaeologistson the whole suite of results from Kenneth Oakley’s chemical tests. Proponentsof the ‘Neolithic-first’ theory of Maltese prehistory have claimed the resultsprove the human teeth from the Cervus Layer of Ghar Dalam to have beenNeolithic, and thus several thousand years younger than the Cervus Layer andprobably introduced by intrusive burial. This is the interpretation that hasentered the history books and become orthodox. Yet we now know that it is basedon disputed, ambiguous and internally contradictory evidence – which may behighly suggestive but which is frankly nowhere near good enough to settle suchan important matter. Worse still, when we look closely at the FUN test results,as Mifsud has enabled us to do by publishing the full set of elusive figuresfrom the Green Book, we find that what they are highly suggestive of – accordingto the standard rules of interpretation – is not the Neolithic date for the GharDalam teeth claimed by the National Museum of Malta. Instead, the predominantoverall pattern of high fluorine, high uranium and low nitrogen that these teethmanifest is, as reported earlier in this chapter, highly suggestive of a date inthe Palaeolithic.81 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn81] It becomeslegitimate, therefore, to wonder why the ‘Neolithic-first’ hypothesis for Maltacontinues to be promulgated at all.Sharif came at the problem in a roundabout way in a recorded telephone interviewwith Louise Humphrey:82 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn82]Sharif: Do you mind me asking, what’s the nature of the Green Book? Are thesethings filed as attached pages or they on separate pages that are easilyremoved.Humphrey: It’s a ring-binder.Sharif: Would a page have to be ripped in order to be removed?Humphrey: No, it could probably be opened, but it would be a hassle, becauseyou’d have to pull out half the pages in the book – M being in the middle of thealphabet, because they’re filed by country.Sharif: Because, you know, the basis of our whole story here is this idea thatsomething is going wrong with the preservation of records relating to Malta. Andthat’s why, I mean, I understand it would be much better to go and see theseresults in a published … in an academic periodical with comments about them, butthey never made it that far except in very abridged and misleading form in a1964 Scientific Report of the National Museum of Malta.Humphrey: The reason they might not have been published is because they wereconsidered suspect.Sharif: Fine, that’s what someone would say who’s not directly involved. But thereal story is why and how these exact same test results were allowed to be usedfrom the beginning to support a Neolithic date. Because in 1968 and earlier,these were valid dating techniques and what they suggested on balance was thatthe human teeth from Ghar Dalam were not Neolithic but Palaeolithic.Humphrey: It was the best that they had then …Sharif: Yes. So it’s really a question of representation, rather than truth. Itis a question of what would happen if evidence was ignored – and it has beenignored in this case. It’s almost not the point of the argument to use this asproof that orthodox opinion is wrong, as much as it is to show that certainpersonalities responsible for forming orthodox opinion about Maltese prehistorydid not give proper consideration to evidence that might have contradicted theirown position.Sharif asked Dr Humphrey whether she herself did not feel it would beinteresting to follow up the ‘anomalous’ uranium oxide reading of 13 parts permillion for Despott’s molar (Ma.2) – a reading, as we’ve seen, that isindicative of Palaeolithic antiquity for this tooth.Humphrey: My interpretation – now, don’t forget these techniques went out of usebefore I was born, I didn’t even learn them at university because they wereobsolete. But my interpretation of them now, as a non-expert, is that they’reinconclusive, that they’re ambiguous. Because, for example, for Ma.2 there isthat seemingly very high uranium result that would suggest an early date. Butyou’ve also got a very high nitrogen result [the contested figure of 1.85 percent] that would suggest a recent date … Erm … so to me that would beunsatisfactory. I would consider that inconclusive.Sharif: OK, it’s not my position to agree or disagree. But it is your positionto stand up, not for what makes good TV and what doesn’t, but for what’sscientifically valid. So, I just wish the Green Book page was there …Humphrey: So do I …Sharif: To end it all…Humphrey: Well, it wouldn’t …Sharif: No it wouldn’t – what would end it would be to carbon-date the contestedtooth.Humphrey: Yeah, I think that’s the only way you’d get any truth out of this.Unfortunately, however, the Maltese authorities remain resolutely opposed to anycarbon-dating of Despott’s molar and have recently been reluctant even to grantaccess to it.LIMBOSince David Trump had in good faith regarded the ‘careful chemical tests’ onDespott’s molar carried out in the 1950s at the Natural History Museum asreliable, we thought it would be interesting for him to hear Louise Humphrey’sview of the tests as ‘inconclusive’ and ‘ambiguous’.Sharif: I just want to ask one more question about these chemical test results.Now, the problem I have with it is, I’ve interviewed Dr Louise Humphrey at theMuseum …Trump: The Natural History Museum in South Kensington?Sharif: Yes, exactly. Now, she’s seen all the results in the Green Book, butonly in Mifsud’s book, which is today the only published record of these resultsin the whole world because, for some reason, the Museum don’t know why, butthey’ve lost the one specific page in the Green Book which has the humanchemical test results for the Ghar Dhalam teeth.Trump: That is a pity. Of course the people who are arguing against it willprobably suggest this was all part of the conspiracy.Sharif: Yes, that’s basically what will happen.Trump: These glorious conspiracy theories!Sharif: I’m in no position to claim there’s dishonesty or whatever. It’s notreally my interest. My interest is that in 2000, in your book, you describedthese as careful chemical analyses which effectively proved that the teeth weremore recent than the deer bones. Now, Dr Louise Humphrey is saying, in 2001 –just last week – she’s saying that these results are completely ambiguous andaren’t really worth the paper they’re written on. Therefore, she’s saying, evenif we found the lost page, it’s not really relevant to archaeological inquiry onMalta. In other words, she’s completely against Oakley’s FUN testing because sheregards it as obsolete and disreputable, basically. What would your view be onthat, considering what you wrote in 2000? The reliability of these chemical testresults, as they stand – and you’ve said you aren’t an expert on them and Iaccept that …Trump: I er … don’t quite know what to say. Erm … the only thing to do would beto … get directly myself, before changing anything, the scientific opinion onthese. And if that is exactly as you say, to admit that those tests did notprove what it was thought at the time they did. Could we please get some moretests done?Sharif: Sure, particularly carbon-dating …Trump: Well now of course we’ve got the AMS that can do it with very smallsamples, that might be possible.Sharif: Mmm, particularly, there’s this one tooth sample, Despott’s molar …Trump: But the deer bones are not … they’re not Pleistocene, are they?Sharif: Yes, the layer is Pleistocene. And the layer above it is, well Mifsudclaims it is a relatively coherent stratigraphic layer …Trump: I see …Sharif: So that does make a barrier above the Cervus Layer which establishesthat the Cervus Layer is Pleistocene. Obviously that doesn’t rule out intrusionof later material into it …Trump: No … Yes … If we could get a direct date on the teeth … That would puthuman occupation back earlier, well before the date we’ve got. But at the momentthen, the whole issue is unproven.Sharif: Yes, that is exactly my feeling. Particularly, Dr Humphrey would drawattention to this nitrogen reading of 1.85 per cent for tooth sample Ma.2 … Youprobably don’t remember any of this …Trump: I don’t, and I wouldn’t know what it meant.Sharif: Oh sure, well basically there is a large amount of internalinconsistency in the results that are reported in the Green Book. These are theresults done on the Maltese samples between 1952 and 1969. Now, from what I cantell from Dr Louise Humphrey who does seem to know her stuff, I must say, isthat at best these results are ambiguous. And if you look at Mifsud, he doesmake quite a good case that particularly with the uranium oxide reading that,yes, they don’t prove anything, but if they are suggestive of anything, it’s ofa Pleistocene date. So what Mifsud is actually alleging is that what Oakleyreported in the official Museum publication in 1964 was not representative – andI’m not saying it’s dishonest, maybe he took what he felt was representative –but the modern opinion is that those results he gave were not representative ofthe full set of results, the majority of which actually suggest a Pleistocenedate. The fluorine and most of the nitrogen and particularly a uranium oxidereading for one of the tooth samples from Ghar Dalam [Despott’s molar] areextremely suggestive of a Pleistocene date. Obviously, we’d much rather havecarbon-dates – but unfortunately carbon-dates are not available for any of theGhar Dalam teeth. So to what extent do you feel that what I’m saying – and I’myour only source for this apparently right now – but how do feel about thiswhole ‘Neolithic-first’ thing in the settlement of Malta if this point is made?Trump: If this point is made, I would accept that we’ve got to reconsider theargument that the Neolithic settlers were the first on the island. I would dothat quite willingly, if secure evidence is put forward. I’ve nothing againstPleistocene settlement of the island …Sharif: Sure, sure, it’s an academic question really, not a question ofreligion. But implicit in that point you just made is that you think thatOakley’s chemical test results are quite pivotal to the ‘Neolithic-first’ case.They’re an important strand of evidence supporting that orthodox model thatthere were no humans before the Neolithic. Is that right?Trump: I think so, yes.Sharif: Is there any other pivotal evidence that supports that?Trump: Only the complete absence of any other evidence. And one has to admitthat negative evidence is never reliable. It may just not have been found. Butuntil either this evidence comes through securely or other evidence comes tolight …Sharif: Well I think the future lies with getting the National Museum in Maltato give access to these most controversial tooth samples from Ghar Dalam toallow them to be carbon-dated. I think that’s the future – this is just my view– but until that’s been done things are rather up in the air.Trump: The whole thing is in limbo really, yes. Yes.THE MIRACULOUS TRANSMUTATION OF BALDACCHINO’S MOLARThere are other matters that add to this sense of Maltese chronology in limbo.Readers will recall that, as well as two teeth with normal roots excavated inGhar Dalam in the 1920s by Caton-Thompson and George Sinclair, there arealtogether three taurodont teeth – Rizzo’s and Despott’s molars, both discoveredin 1917, and Baldacchino’s molar, discovered in 1936. Where reference codes havebeen applied to these teeth they are prefixed ‘Gh.D’ in the case of the NationalMuseum of Malta, and ‘Ma.’ in the case of the Natural History Museum. Thus, forexample, the Natural History Museum code for Despott’s 1917 taurodont molar isMa.2, for Caton-Thompson’s normal tooth Ma.1, and for Baldacchino’s 1936taurodont molar Ma.7. The National Museum of Malta code for Baldacchino’s molaris Gh.D/3.Although Baldacchino’s molar was one of the teeth assayed for its nitrogen levelat the Natural History Museum in 1952, we’ve seen that the very low result of0.44 per cent that it produced was withheld from the 1964 official Report on thetests. Then in 1971, Evans’ Prehistoric Antiquities of the Maltese Islandssomehow failed to mention the existence of Baldacchino’s molar at all in itssurvey of Ghar Dalam, and discussed the taurodont controversy with referenceonly to the Rizzo’s and Despott’s molars. Since Evans’ text remains the basicwork of reference on prehistoric Malta, the net effect of this omission was toconsign Baldacchino’s molar to a research limbo – where it stayed until AntonMifsud focused attention on it again in 1997 when he published the suppressed1952 test results in Dossier Malta.The odd thing is that when Baldacchino discovered the tooth in 1936 he describedit as being heavily fossilized. Today the very few people who have been allowedto see it in the vaults of the National Museum of Malta report that it is notfossilized – and this mysterious transmutation is confirmed in Anton Mifsud’s1997 photographs ‘where it is evidently identical in shade to modern molarteeth, rather than to the 1917 molars’.83[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn83]Even odder is the fact that a startling discrepancy exists between the very lowresult of 0.44 per cent obtained from the tooth in the 1952 nitrogen assay andthe result of the uranium oxide assay that was carried out on it in the 1960s atKenneth Oakley’s request (this was at the same time that Oakley also ran theuranium assay on Despott’s molar). The nitrogen result makes Baldacchino’s molarvery old – definitely Palaeolithic. But the uranium assay gave ‘a nil readingfor uranium oxide’,84 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn84] indicatingthat the tooth was most probably modern.85[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn85] Last but not least, although thetooth now coded Gh.D/3 in the vaults of the National Museum of Malta is ataurodont, Mifsud points out that its degree of taurodontism is relatively minor– mesotaurodont or hypotaurodont, and that it certainly does not attain the verylarge hypertaurodontic type of the two 1917 molars.86[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn86]What should we conclude from these paradoxes? The obvious answer, Mifsudsuggests, is that Baldacchino’s molar was old when it was described asfossilized in 1936, and still old when it was assayed for nitrogen in 1952, butit was no longer old when it was assayed for uranium in the 1960s. In otherwords, a modern taurodont tooth – perhaps one of several that are known to havebeen extracted in Malta during the early 1960s87[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn87] – was substituted forBaldacchino’s Palaeolithic molar some time after its nitrogen test in the 1950sand before its uranium test in the 1960s.It is impossible to guess who might have actually carried out the switch but itwas undoubtedly facilitated by the peculiar lack of documentation that afflictedthe tooth after 1952. As we’ve seen, Evans failed to mention it in 1971. Mifsudpoints out that it was also:omitted in subsequent references to taurodontism in archaic human remains. J. L.Pace (1972) and G.

Perhaps we should regard the switching – and apparent loss – ofBaldacchino’s molar as plain negligence, along with the ignoring andmisrepresenting of crucial data in the Green Book. Still, I have to besuspicious of the fact that negligence in Maltese archaeology has always tendedto remove evidence that threatened the ‘Neolithic-first’ theory of Malteseprehistory.Anthony Frendo is courageous enough to stick his neck out from the ivory towersof the University of Malta to acknowledge, albeit carefully, that something isamiss:The evidence marshalled by Mifsud indicates that the tooth examined in 1968 … isnot the same as that examined originally in 1952. There is no direct evidence toaffirm that an intentional switch did take place, but it is well-nigh conclusivethat the tooth in question is not the same.91[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-ftn91]"},{"pageContent":"19 / INUNDATIONOne hears frequently of Malta’s ‘land-bridges’. Such there certainly were, atleast north to Sicily – they are needed to explain the fossil fauna of GharDalam for example – but not, as far as we know, at a period when there were mento take advantage of them. They are of great interest to the geologist andpalaeontologist, but none to the archaeologist.Dr David Trump, 2000Anton Mifsud and his colleagues have exposed the Palaeolithic skeleton (andteeth!) in the cupboard of Maltese prehistory. But their investigation has takenyears of dedicated effort, patiently cutting through the misrepresentations, theomissions of contradictory data and the strange disappearances of pivotalevidence that have allowed archaeologists to persist for so long with thefiction that no humans reached these islands until the Neolithic around 5200 BC.Since 1997, the National Museum of Archaeology has been embroiled in anunwelcome local media controversy – that has refused to die down – about thevery grave charges set out in Dossier Malta. And since 1999 the evidentpreference of senior officials that the ‘Mifsud problem’ should (like the GharDalam teeth?) just ‘go away’ has been further frustrated by the visible supportnow being given by prominent archaeologists such as Anthony Frendo to the demandfor a complete review of the prehistory of Malta in the light of the confirmedpresence of Palaeolithic man.But this ferment – which is really a struggle for the soul of Malta’s past – hasso far remained very much an internal Maltese problem. Beyond the shores of theislands, where Dossier has never been published or circulated, the internationalcommunity remains ignorant of the scandal – and the prehistory of the world’soldest free-standing megalithic temples continues to be taught without anyreference at all to the Palaeolithic.The tampering and selective loss of anomalous evidence that Mifsud alleges isonly part of the problem. Much damage, in my view, has already been done by twogenerations of archaeologists ‘conditioned’ in the school of J. D. Evans, whohave tended to filter, or redefine, or file as ‘out of context’ any hints ortraces of human activities before 5200 BC that they might have come across intheir fieldwork in Malta. And I want to be clear that I am not attributing thesetendencies to any conspiracy. It’s just a matter of how the rational mind works:if the foundation of everything you have been taught and believe about Malta isthat it was first inhabited by humans in the Neolithic then this makes it muchmore difficult to see the Palaeolithic, even if it’s there. Perhaps the mostsignificant consequence, certainly until very recently, is a profound lack ofinterest amongst archaeologists in the fact that Malta, Comino and Gozo werejoined to form one large island in the late Palaeolithic – an island that was inturn joined to Sicily by a land-bridge 90 kilometres long (and thence to theItalian peninsula).[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_097_r1.jpg]David Trump says it all when he writes:One hears frequently of Malta’s ‘land-bridges’. Such there certainly were, atleast north to Sicily – they are needed to explain the fossil fauna of GharDalam for example – but not, as far as we know, at a period when there were mento take advantage of them. They are of great interest to the geologist andpalaeontologist, but none to the archaeologist.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn1]This is from the updated edition (March 2000) of Trump’s Archaeological Guide,published three years after the revelations in Dossier. The loud and clearmessage that it sends is that there is simply no point in looking underwateralong the now-submerged land-bridge to Sicily to increase our knowledge ofMaltese prehistory. On the contrary, Trump emphasizes, the land-bridge is of nointerest to archaeologists because, ‘as far as we know’, there were no humans totake advantage of it.However, it is clear that David Trump, unlike some of his colleagues, is anopen-minded man. Interviewed in October 2001, he did not prove to be a stubbornor dogmatic adherent to the orthodox ‘Neolithic-first’ model of Maltesesettlement, was genuinely disturbed to learn about the ambiguities anduncertainties in the full gamut of results from the FUN tests carried out byKenneth Oakley in the 1950s and 1960s and concluded (see chapter 18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c18_r1.htm#c18]) that until modern C-14 tests could beconducted to confirm the age of Despott’s molar and the other Ghar Dalamsamples, ‘the whole thing is in limbo, really’.Since this is also the view of Louise Humphrey at the Natural History Museum inLondon (again see chapter 18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c18_r1.htm#c18]), it seemsto me – though no one has perhaps noticed – that a Rubicon has already beencrossed. As Trump admitted in his October 2001 interview with Sharif Sakr, theFUN results were so fundamental to the construction of the ‘Neolithic-first’paradigm of orthodox Maltese archaeology that – if they are discredited – thereremains no positive evidence whatsoever for that paradigm: ‘only the completeabsence of any other evidence. And one has to admit that negative evidence isnever reliable. It may just not have been found.’Trump’s openness to the notion that evidence for a Palaeolithic human presencein Malta might simply not yet have been found prompted a question on his currentviews concerning the land-bridge issue.Sharif: OK, we’ll move on. In your Archaeological Guide, you state somewhere …oh yes … the land-bridge idea. You state that the land-bridge is of no interestto the archaeologist – have you changed your opinion on that? It might berelevant to help you gauge the likelihood of finding evidence of Palaeolithicman on Malta in the future.Trump: Well, we accept that … But I’d use the word possibility, not likelihood …If there was a land-bridge, that means the sea-level was very much lower – soall the most desirable countryside, coastal plains, etc., are deep underwaterand there’s no hope of finding evidence of it.Sharif: Well, what about marine archaeology? Would you be in favour in principleof marine exploration to see if there’s anything …Trump: Not a hope. I mean if you’ve got shipwrecks or even drowned buildingsthen fair enough, but if you’re looking for a scatter of flints on the bed ofthe sea, I don’t think there’s a remotest possibility of ever finding them.Sharif: Because Palaeolithic archaeological evidence is so …Trump: Scanty. I mean it’s difficult enough, I won’t say impossible, but it’sdifficult enough above water. Below water there’s not a remotest hope.Woven into Trump’s view is the perception, shared by the vast majority oforthodox archaeologists, that human activity in the Palaeolithic was limited toa very simple material culture that left only scanty remains such as scatters offlints. The perception is a reasonable one, since this is all that any sitesdefinitely recognized as Palaeolithic on land anywhere in the world have evershown to the excavator. But this reasonable perception is also a self-fulfillingprophecy. It predicts that nothing surprising or unusual about the Palaeolithic– perhaps even ‘drowned buildings’ – who knows? – can be expected to be found atthe bottom of the sea. And since this is the case, and the remains ofPalaeolithic material culture are in general so scanty, there would not be ‘aremotest hope’ of finding them underwater.It is easy to see how out of this perception flows the untested conclusion, atleast where Maltese prehistory is concerned, that it is not worth lookingunderwater at all. Yet the possibility cannot be ruled out that the study ofarchaeological remains submerged at the end of the Ice Age could shed light onthe mysterious origins of Malta’s megalithic civilization with its apparentlyunprecedented temples, unlike any others known in the world, its elaborategoddess cult – distinctively Palaeolithic in general style and symbolism – andits few surviving traces of cave paintings executed in the same pigments of redochre and black manganese oxide that were favoured by Palaeolithic artists.REFUGE MALTAThe closing millennia of the Ice Age, between around 17,000 years ago and thearbitrary ‘end’ of the Palaeolithic 12,000 years ago, were not only a period ofrapidly melting ice-caps and rapidly rising sea-levels but also a period inwhich climate conditions across Europe were wildly unstable and frequentlyextremely cold and arid (see chapter 3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03]). In the high latitudes, until thekilometres-thick ice-sheets had melted, human life would have been impossible-while even in lower latitudes many of the vast areas of inland Europe that werenominally ice-free were reduced to bleak and inhospitable tundra.Given such conditions it would have been natural for human beings – at any levelof social development – to migrate towards warmer and more congenial climes. Andwe can tell from the distribution of fossil remains that this was certainly thesurvival strategy adopted by all ‘cold-intolerant’ animal species of the period– including game species such as red deer [Cervus elephas) that we know werehunted by Palaeolithic humans. Places of refuge where the local climate was forone reason or another less harsh – scientists studying the Ice Age use thetechnical term ‘refugia’ for such sanctuaries of life – were inevitably soughtfurther and further south during the worst episodes.Straddling the thirty-sixth parallel, Malta is the southernmost point of Europe– indeed it is further south than the cities of Tunis or Algiers in NorthAfrica. And while Malta today is a small archipelago 90 kilometres from Sicily –which is itself separated from the Italian mainland by the Straits of Messina –we know that this was not the case at the Last Glacial Maximum 18,000 years ago.We would know this even without the modern science of inundation mapping to showus the changes that transformed the antediluvian Siculo-Maltese land-massbetween 18,000 and 10,000 years ago. We would know it, as Trump rightly pointsout, because of the presence of large quantities of fossil fauna in Ghar Dalamsuch as the Pleistocene European red deer, wolf, brown bear and fox, which werenot big swimmers and could only have come on foot to Malta by way of aland-bridge. Indeed, there is no dispute from any authority that during theextremely cold and arid periods that occurred several times between 17,000 and10,000 years ago:man and animals could migrate from the Italian peninsula, by land, to the warmerclimates of the Siculo-Maltese district. Herds of red deer left northernlatitudes and settled in all parts of present-day Sicily, the present-day Egadiislands of Favignana and Levanzo, and the Maltese archipelago, the latter sitebeing the warmest of the Siculo-Maltese district during the Pleistocene.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn2]So here is the puzzle. On the tiny islands of Favignana and Levanzo, which, likeMalta, were joined to Sicily (and hence to the mainland) during the Ice Age,there is abundant and undisputed evidence, including cave graffiti carbon-datedto 12,000 years ago, for the presence of Palaeolithic man.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn3] Sicily, today the largestMediterranean island, presents even more abundant evidence of an even moreancient human presence. As Anton Mifsud reminds us,Humans have indubitably inhabited it for much of the Palaeolithic, and it has aclear sequence of carbon-dated lithic implements, in places reaching back to theAcheulean [between 600,000 and 75,000 bp).4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn4] The caverns hold the same faunalassemblage as that at Ghar Dalam, namely Pleistocene hippo-elephant-deer fauna.Upper Palaeolithic cultures have been identified in all regions of Sicily,including the south-eastern region of the Hyblean plateau which abuts theSiculo-Maltese land-bridge of the Pleistocene …5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn5]Only an attitude of stupefied indifference to the implications of theland-bridge for the mobility of Palaeolithic humans can explain whyarchaeologists did not become concerned much earlier by the apparently‘apalaeolithic’ status of the Maltese islands – a status that seems acutelyanomalous when viewed in its regional context and that becomes even harder toexplain when we remember that Malta was the furthest south, the warmest and themost suitable refugium of the entire Siculo-Maltese landmass. Obviously, withthe same cold-intolerant fauna roaming freely across the whole of that landmass– very much including Malta, as we know from Ghar Dalam – there is no goodreason why Palaeolithic humans, who are everywhere else believed to havefollowed and hunted that same fauna, should not have reached Malta as well.And, as we now know, they did.THE DROWNING OF THE LAND-BRIDGEG. A. Milne to Graham Hancock13 July 2001, 19:22Subject: MapsGraham,I ran some new high resolution predictions of sea-level change and made maps forthe Tyrrhenian6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn6] and MediterraneanSeas. There are four .pdf attachments showing the coastline at the times18.3 kyr BP16.4 kyr BP14.6 kyr BP13.4 kyr BP(these are all calibrated times). You will see that Malta became isolatedbetween 16.4 and 14.6 kyr bp. The large loss of land area between 14.6 and 13.5kyr bp is associated with the melting event known as Meltwater Pulse 1-A (about15–20 metres sea-level rise in about 500 years around 14 kyr bp).7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn7]I hope the maps are useful. There may have been some significant tectonic motionin this region that is not accounted for in my predictions.Cheers,GlennThis was the second batch of Maltese inundation maps that Glenn Milne had sentme – the first batch, at lower resolution and wider intervals, covered the sameTyrrhenian region of the central Mediterranean as it had looked 21,300 years ago(21.3 kyr BP), 10,600 years ago, 4800 years ago and the present day.Scrolling through each of the maps one after the other there were a number ofimmediate and obvious observations to make: * Until 16,400 years ago Malta was still joined to Sicily by a land-bridge. * The land-bridge was severed by rising sea-levels between 16,400 years ago and 14,600 years ago. However, the new straits created were at first extremely narrow and most of the mass of the former isthmus remained above water. * Between 14,600 years ago and 13,500 years ago there were very dramatic losses of land and all the remaining parts of the antediluvian isthmus were swallowed up by the sea. * Despite these losses Malta, Comino and Gozo were still joined to form a single larger island 13,500 years ago. But other than an extension a few kilometres in width along parts of the north-east coast, the surface-area of that landmass had been reduced to dimensions only a little larger than those of today. * By 10,600 years ago the separation of Malta, Comino and Gozo had occurred and the islands were virtually indistinguishable from their modern appearance.BEFORE THE FLOOD: 18,300 YEARS AGOThe map opposite presents the region as it would have appeared 18,300 years ago.As well as revealing the much greater extent of Italy when global sea-level wasat its lowest, particularly on the Adriatic side of the peninsula,8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn8] and the enlargement of Corsica,Sardinia and the North African coast, it demonstrates that the situation of theMaltese islands was utterly different from their situation today. Instead ofbeing a tiny archipelago lost in the central Mediterranean, Malta 18,300 yearsago formed an integral part of the Italian mainland through the isthmus thenconnecting it to Sicily. The isthmus was approximately twenty times larger thanthe present Maltese islands, running not only 90 kilometres to the north butalso extending more than 70 kilometres further to the south and east.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_098_r1.jpg]All along the north-east coast of antediluvian Malta, effectively an extensionof the land-bridge, there was an exposed shelf, approximately 8 to 12 kilometresin width.Along the south-west coast, although it is beyond the limits of resolution ofthe map to determine very fine details of the inundation sequence, it is certainthat Filfla – which today is separated from Malta by a strait 3 kilometres wide– was not isolated. With that reservation, however, it is notable how relativelyminor the changes along this coast seem to have been during the past 18,000years – a product of the steep cliffs and sheer drop-aways to depths greaterthan the maximum fall in sea-level of around 120 metres.I emphasize that the changes seem to have been minor quite deliberately in viewof Glenn Milne’s explicit warning that his model cannot take into account‘significant tectonic motion in this region’. The caveat is important becausethe central Mediterranean is one of the world’s tectonic and seismic hotspotsand has experienced massive volcanic eruptions and earthquakes routinelythroughout the historic and prehistoric periods.9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn9] Sudden elevations and subsidenceof land, which might have had dramatic effects on relative sea-levels atspecific locations, are entirely possible in such an area. Indeed, as we’veseen, this is precisely what Anton Mifsud suggests did happen in south-westernMalta 4200 years ago following a cataclysmic fault collapse along the submarinePantalleria Rift.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn10] In additionto its well-documented Ice Age extensions to the north-east, north, east andsouth-east, we should therefore keep our minds open to Mifsud’s suggestion thatantediluvian Malta may have possessed a substantial extension to the south-westduring the Palaeolithic that may have remained above water until it subsidedcatastrophically into the sea at the end of the temple-building period.A final point of observation comes when we zoom out of the above map. With Maltaand its land-bridge extending far to the south of the eastern tip of Sicily andwith a similar southerly extension to Sicily’s western tip – almost like twohorns reaching out to touch the North African coast (itself also greatlyenlarged) - the eastern and western sides of the Mediterranean came very close18,300 years ago to being divided into two separate seas. This enclosing andfunnelling of great waters through narrow spaces could have enormouslyintensified the effects of the post-glacial floods when they hit the region.Indeed, as readers may recall from chapter 3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03], it has been suggested that at timesthe meltdown of the European ice-sheet into the Mediterranean was so severe thatthe Mediterranean ‘bath tub’ filled up more rapidly than the excess waters coulddrain out through the Straits of Gibraltar (which were reduced to a width ofonly 8 kilometres at the Last Glacial Maximum).11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn11] It has been proposed that suchmeltwater surges ‘could have temporarily raised the Mediterranean by some 60metres’.12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c19-ftn12]However, this calculation is based on the bottleneck effect caused by the narrowStraits of Gibraltar alone. Now we know that there would have been a secondbottleneck between the Siculo-Maltese landmass and the North African coast whichwould certainly have made things worse – although how much worse is difficult tocalculate. In addition, the consolidation of Corsica and Sardinia into one largeisland enclosed much of the Tyrrhenian Sea – and this would have furtherexacerbated the local effects of the meltdown there.But hardly a trickle out of the vast reservoirs of meltwater hemmed in on theEuropean ice-cap had yet reached the Mediteranean 18,300 years ago. Hardly atrickle over the previous 3000 years. Hardly a trickle – and spread out over somany generations that individuals would not have noticed the tiny ominouschanges taking place.MINOR EROSION: 16,400 YEARS AGOOver the 1900 years between 18,300 years ago and 16,400 years ago the mapopposite shows that there was only further minor erosion of the coastal marginsand a narrowing of the Malta-Sicily land-bridge.MALTA BECOMES AN ISLAND: 14,600 YEARS AGOThe map opposite documents the isolation of Malta some time between 16,400 yearsago and 14,600 years ago. The event was not a particularly dramatic one in termsof land-loss, though it would undoubtedly have held great significance for thePalaeolithic Maltese who we now know were present then. For the first time theywere cut off from the mainland. Perhaps this Palaeolithic isolation, rather thanthe Neolithic invasion that occurred more than 7000 years later, was the realgenesis of the distinctive character and achievements of Maltese civilization.THE APOCALYPSE: 13,500 YEARS AGOIt is in the map on page 422 that we see the effects of ‘Meltwater Pulse 1A’-the first of the three global superfloods into which most of the10,000-year-long meltdown of the Ice Age was concentrated (see chapter 3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03]). As Milne points out, Meltwater Pulse1A raised global sea-level by 15–20 metres in just 500 years around 14,000 yearsago. That sounds bad enough. However, it is not necessarily the case that thisvery large rise was evenly spread out over the 500-year period resolved byinundation science. In my view the uncertainties regarding post-glacial eventsmake it possible that all or most of it could have been compressed into a singleevent of much shorter duration anywhere within that 500-year period.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_099_r1.jpg]What the map at any rate reveals is that the newly isolated Malta of 14,600years ago had lost 70 kilometres of its width by 13,500 years ago due to thecomplete and relatively rapid inundation of its former large extension to theeast and south. No marine archaeology has ever been done on these submergedlowlands, which may conceal archaeological evidence of vital importance to thefull understanding of Malta’s prehistory.The map also shows that Malta had actually become two islands 13,500 years ago –one, to the west, consisting of the present Malta, Comino and Gozo joined into asingle mass, and the other, quite small, lying a little to the east. It isnotable that other than this eastern islet nothing was left by this stage of theformer grandeur of antediluvian Malta except a reduced extension 2 to 5kilometres wide along the north-eastern coastal strip.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_100_r1.jpg]THE END OF THE PALAEOLITHIC: 10,600 YEARS AGOBy 10,000 years ago the Maltese archipelago was as it is today. The islet to theeast had gone, and the extension of the north-east coast had also been fullysubmerged. It is somewhere on this north-eastern extension, however – the verylast part of antediluvian Malta to go beneath the sea – that the rumouredunderwater ‘temple’ sighted off Sliema by Commander Scicluna and by the Arrigobrothers must be located. The implication of the inundation maps, therefore, isthat this structure was submerged between 13,500 years ago and 10,600 years ago– a date that can probably be pinned down more narrowly to around 11,000 yearsago, marking the second of the three episodes of global superfloods outlined inchapter 3.I want to re-emphasize here that the inundation maps have no bearing one way orthe other on the matter of Anton Mifsud’s proposed extension of Malta to thesouth-west – which he suggests was submerged by tectonic subsidence as late as4200 years ago. As noted earlier, the inundation maps cannot account for largeunregistered tectonic events in prehistory and such events are probable insouth-west Malta because of its proximity to the Pantalleria Rift.The evidence that such an event did occur around 2200 BC is strong and may proveto be the final key necessary to unlock the mysterious origins of Maltesecivilization."},{"pageContent":"20 / THE MORNING OF THE WORLDGraham Hancock: If we take the dating of a temple like Mnajdra or Hagar Qim, thebetter-known temples, how many samples of carbon-datable material would thisdating be based on?Anthony Bonanno: Nothing at all.MNAJDRA, 20 JUNE 2000It is a little after five a.m., and dark, when we park our rented car near HagarQim. There are watchmen huddled together, drinking tea. They won’t be on dutyduring the night of 16 April 2001 when Mnajdra gets trashed by a well-organizedassault-squad armed with sledgehammers, but right now they’re working overtime.Their mission is to keep out any peaceful hippies who might want to commune withthe solstice at the temples before they open officially at eight – althoughapparently it’s tomorrow that most of the would-be meditators and pagans areexpected to show up.Hagar Qim is enclosed by a tall wire-mesh fence, which we now walk around on ourway down to Mnajdra. Through the fence the row of big, heavily eroded megalithson the south-west side of the temple can be seen glowing whitely, like the teethof an ancient giant disinterred from the earth.I love dawn in Malta in midsummer, with the smell of wild thyme on the softbreeze, and the sea, dark in its depths, quicksilver at the surface, stretchingaway beneath the fading stars. It always feels like … the morning of the world.As though some wonderful experience – I don’t know what – is just about toenvelop me and change me for ever.The sky is lightening as we walk, and way off-shore to our south I begin to makeout the distant shape of Filfla rising out of the sea. I am troubled by vaguefeelings of guilt about not having arranged to dive the strait between here andthe little island because I’m genuinely intrigued by Anton Mifsud’s theory ofmajor land subsidence in this area in 2200 BC. Since my first meeting with himon 16 June I’ve consulted my copy of the British Admiralty Chart for Malta andfound that it shows a submerged ridge, the top of which is nowhere deeper than49 metres, running from the rocks of the Hamrija shallows directly beneathMnajdra all the way out to Filfla. On either side of the ridge, roughly east andwest of it, the bottom drops off steeply to 80, 90 and then 100 metres.It would be extremely interesting, though technically demanding, to explore theridge, especially inside the zone with a radius of 1 kilometre centred on Filflaitself that is enticingly marked ‘Entry Prohibited’ on my chart. If Mifsud isright that a greater landmass collapsed here 4200 years ago, then the shatteredremains of man-made structures built in former times along the Filfla-Mnajdraridge could await discovery at the bottom of the strait. And though they mighthave been submerged as recently as 2200 BC –as Mifsud’s research suggests – whois to say when such structures might have been built?[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_101_r1.jpg]Theoretically, they might have been built thousands of years earlier than HagarQim and Mnajdra, might be the true Palaeolithic predecessors of the greattemples of the Neolithic era, and might have survived, revered and imitated,down to Mifsud’s date of 2200 BC, when the land on which they stood sank beneaththe sea …Theoretically, other relics of Malta’s missing megalithic heritage could havebeen submerged much earlier by the rising seas that followed the Last GlacialMaximum – especially so if they had been built in the north and east during thelate Palaeolithic when a land-bridge 90 kilometres in extent connected Sliema toSicily …And theoretically, of course, pigs might fly, lions might lie down with lambs –anything is possible …Still, there is the problem of the unexplained origins of Malta’s remarkabletemple-building culture and the sequence which requires us to believe thatGigantija, and the oldest parts of Mnajdra, were that culture’s first-everexperiments in free-standing monumental architecture. And there is the problemof the model temples, some fashioned from terracotta, some from stone, excavatedfrom within the temples themselves and now usefully on display in the NationalMuseum in Valletta.1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn1] While someof these beautiful little models faithfully depict temples of exactly the typethat have survived to this day, a few others show an entirely different, highlygeometric style of megalithic architecture, where the theme is all straightlines and recurrent right-angles.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn2] Why don’t we find the ruins ofthe original structures that these other, rectilinear models supposedlyrepresent? Are they just ‘architect’s designs’, dreamed up but never realized,as David Trump asserts?3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn3] Or couldthey preserve the images of temples that once existed and were swallowed by thesea?I’m deep in these thoughts as we approach the entrance to Mnajdra. It’s almostfull daylight now, the sun washing the whole sky with a soft, indirect glow, andI can see through the wire-mesh fence that as well as two guards by the gate,there are at least three other people, dwarfed by the ponderous megaliths,already inside the temple precincts. One of them is mounting a video camera on atripod; one has a clunky garland of SLR cameras slung around his neck; the thirdis clutching a biro and a spiral-bound notebook.I groan inwardly. The solstice effect at Mnajdra is supposedly subtle andbeautiful, one of the powerful epiphanies of archaic surveying and astronomy. Iwant to see it with no distractions – just silence, the temple and the sun – sothat it can speak most clearly for itself. Now at the bare minimum I am going tohave to be polite to strangers, make small talk and exchange opinions while wewait for the effect to begin.I observe out of the corner of my eye that the man with the notebook is walkingtowards me and obviously intends to introduce himself. Why do human beings haveto talk, I find myself wondering. Is it really necessary for us to make thesenoises?‘It’s Graham Hancock, isn’t it?’ he asks. ‘Remember me? I’m Chris Micallef.’Suddenly I recognize him. He’s the nephew of the late Paul Micallef, the Maltesearchaeo-astronomer who first undertood that Mnajdra is a solar calendar in stoneand began to unlock the ingenious precision of its alignments. I met Chrisduring the generally disappointing flurry of our previous stay in Malta inNovember 1999 when he gave me his uncle’s book,4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn4] then lost touch with himafterwards. Far from being a source of unwelcome noise, he’s the very bestperson I could possibly hope to meet at Mnajdra. His uncle’s book is why I’mhere.THE SEA KEEPS ITS SECRETSJUNE 2000-JUNE 2001After the June 2000 trip when I witnessed the solstice effect at Mnajdra,exactly a year passed until we were able to get back to Malta again. But,despite the risks, the frustrations and the expense of the previous trips, Iremained convinced that the rumours and whispers of submerged structures wereworth pursuing.Part of this new up-beat mood, as I’ve explained, was my discovery of the lateCommander Scicluna’s involvement in the matter and the report that he hadpublished in the Sunday Times of Malta in 1994 of having found a megalithictemple underwater off Sliema at a depth of 25 feet.But another part of it came from my growing acquaintance with the work of Antonand Simon Mifsud, Charles Savona Ventura, Chris Agius and others. Their researchhelped me to realize that although orthodox archaeologists had probably weighed,measured and counted everything Neolithic on Malta, they had done no justice atall to the possibility – no, the certainty – of a human presence here during thePalaeolithic. On the contrary, it seemed that J. D. Evans had gone to greatlengths to bury that possibility so deeply that it would never vex his‘Stentinello First’ hypothesis again. And while he might not have been thevillain who actually switched Baldacchino’s molar for a modern taurodont or puta misleading interpretation on the results of the FUN tests carried out in the1950s and 1960s, these actions signal – at the very least – a ruthless resolveand an indifference to truth on the part of a person or persons highly placed inMaltese and museum circles. In such a murky setting, where I already knew thatthere had been outrageous tampering with evidence and gerrymandering of records,it seemed to me to be absolutely within the bounds of possibility that muchworse could have been done.Just suppose, for example – speculation only – that traces of an earlier,pre-Neolithic civilization had been found on Malta during the 1950s. Suppose theevidence was fragmentary, small, but clear. Would the discovery ever have beenmade public? Somehow I doubted it. Indeed, the net of confusion and misdirectionwoven over the years concerning the Ghar Dalam taurodont teeth seemed to me todemonstrate that such a discovery would never have been made public at all if itcould possibly have been hushed up.Still, there remained one place where no evidence could yet have been tamperedwith and where the ruins of a former civilization, if truly ancient, might havebeen preserved for thousands of years. That, of course, was under the sea. Andthat was why it seemed worth keeping an open mind about doing more diving inMalta and paying attention to any sightings by local divers of submergedstructures.Just a month after our June 2000 trip had ended I received an e-mail from AntonMifsud telling me of two such sightings.The first was from Audrey and Rupert Mifsud – friends of Anton’s but no relation– who own a dive shop called Buddies on Ramla Bay in northern Malta. Leading adive off nearby Marfa Point on the north-west side of the island, whilst some oftheir clients were taking souvenir snapshots of each other in an area ofinteresting underwater scenery, Audrey had swum over a series of parallel‘canals’, which had immediately caught her attention as being very unusual anddistinctive. Returning to the spot on a second dive, she had discovered severalmore of these canals cut into the limestone sea-bed at a depth of 8 metres.Beyond the canals, but directly below them near the bottom of a drop-off at 25metres, Rupert had explored an unusual cave and found three large regular stepscarved inside it.The second discovery, also in northern Malta, had been made by Chris AgiusSultana, an experienced spear fisherman and scuba-diver and one of theco-authors, with Anton, of Echoes of Plato’s Island. Off Qawra Point on thenorth-east side of Malta Chris too had found an underwater ‘canal’, this timesurmounted by what he said looked like a low bridge, at a depth of 20 metres.STORM GODMALTA, 18–19 JUNE 2001Santha and I arrived in Malta on 18 June 2001 for our third research visit. Butthis was a filming trip, too, so our time would not be our own after the eveningof the 20th, when the Channel 4 crew were scheduled to join us. Our plan was toput in a couple of days of diving before they arrived – the 19th for an advancelook at the new sites found by Chris Agius and the Mifsuds in the north, and the20th for a more targeted search off Sliema at 1 kilometre rather than 3kilometres from the shore, particularly if Shaun Arrigo could be persuaded toguide us. Because both time and money were running too short to allow the luxuryof speculative search diving with no definite prior sightings to follow, I madethe decision that on this trip we would not try to pursue the tempting questionof what – if anything – might lie at the bottom of the strait between Mnajdraand Filfla.There is a god of stormy weather who likes to follow me around. Honestly, I’mcoming to believe this. Ask anyone who dives with me regularly. For the entireweek before our arrival the seas around Malta had been flat calm, no clouds, noteven a breeze – perfect conditions for really successful diving. But soon afterour plane touched down on the afternoon of the 18th, a strong wind began to blowin from the north-west. This was the very worst kind of wind that we couldpossibly face, as Malta’s orientation is approximately north-west to south-east.Nor’westers therefore blow down both sides of the island so that Marfa Point inthe north-west, and Qawra Point and Sliema along the north-east coast would allbe equally badly affected.We hoped that the wind would fade during the night but it strengthened and onthe morning of the 19th we sat with Chris Agius in his Land Rover looking at thebig breaking waves lashing in over Qawra Point.‘I don’t get it,’ Chris protested in obvious disbelief. ‘Until yesterdayafternoon the weather was perfect.’‘It’s just my storm god,’ I replied gloomily. ‘He often does this to me.’We debated going in anyway, but since I had come close to death tackling asimilar shore-dive in similar conditions in Tenerife the year before, I finallydecided against it. Whatever was underwater off Qawra Point wasn’t goinganywhere and would still be here on the 22nd, our scheduled day of diving withthe film crew. Then we’d be using a 50 foot boat to cover both the underwatersites in the north and wouldn’t have to worry about getting smashed to bitsagainst the rocks doing a dodgy entry or exit from shore.AROUND MALTA WITH THE VIKING19–20 JUNE 2001The wind continued to blow all day on the 19th and all day on the 20th, boilingup the waves into an angry foam. But at least the sun was still shining, the skywas clear and there wasn’t any rain. So instead of diving we spent the two daysdriving around Malta with Chris Agius, who is in his mid-thirties with glacialblue eyes and looks like a Viking, and who willingly shared his insights andresearch with us.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_102_r1.jpg]It turned out that it had been Chris who first took the idea that Malta might bea remnant of Atlantis to Anton Mifsud -and Anton had initially been sceptical.But as he had investigated the matter further, he had gradually been won roundto Chris’s point of view – hence, ultimately, their book Echoes of Plato’sIsland.I’d last read the book thoroughly when Anton had e-mailed the text to me aroundSeptember 2000, so this was a good opportunity to clarify a few points.‘If I remember correctly, Echoes identifies the Atlantis flood as an event herein Malta caused by land collapse in the south-west around 2200 BC?’‘That’s right. But of course the temple civilization was much older than that.’‘How much older?’ I asked.We were sitting in the bar of the Lapsi Waterfront Hotel in Balluta Bay on theevening of the 19th and Chris looked left and right over his shoulder beforereplying: ‘Maybe twelve thousand years older. It was a civilization of the lastIce Age.’‘But how do you know that?’‘I’ve seen things,’ Chris hinted mysteriously. Then he laughed: ‘But I can’tprove this. Not yet anyway. I’m working on it.’On the 20th we spent a couple of hours stumbling around Malta’s biggestconcentration of rock-hewn ‘cart-ruts’ nicknamed Clapham Junction. Up to a metredeep, and in some cases almost a metre wide at the surface – though narrowingtowards the base – they are incised into a big outcrop of bedrock sloping gentlyuphill between Buskett Gardens and the cliffs at Dingli about 5 kilometres westof Hagar Qim and Mnajdra. But unlike the temples that have come down to us fromremote antiquity – near many of which impressive groups of ruts have been found– the ruts themselves suggest no obvious function, either ceremonial orutilitarian.Some, as we saw in chapter 15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c15_r1.htm#c15],disappear directly into the sea. Others stop abruptly at the edge of cliffs 100metres above the waves. Others run between two once connected but now separatelocations such as Filfla and Mnajdra. The majority, however, are found intightly packed groups criss-crossing one another as at Clapham Junction. Andalthough it is undoubtedly the case that very large and heavy-wheeled or sleddedvehicles would leave parallel ruts looking quite like these if they were to berolled or dragged through a field of thick mud or clay, it is altogether adifferent matter to imagine how such tracks – and so many of them – could beimpressed into solid rock. And what would the motive have been? What would themotive have been if the ruts had been worn down a pair or two at a time by therunners of wooden sleds (at present a popular orthodox theory)? How long wouldit have taken, this way, to make all the ruts that scar the island?And what would the motive have been if, by some mighty effort, all the ruts hadbeen made at more or less the same time?WAILING AND SCREAMING FROM UNDERGROUND …20 JUNE 2001After the cart-ruts Chris drove us up to a hilltop named Salib ta Gholia with aview over the twin cities of Rabat and Mdina. The hill was crowned by asixteenth-century church built out of beautiful limestone ashlars, which glowedgold in the afternoon light. On its wall was a notice in Latin stating that theright of sanctuary formerly accorded to fugitives taking refuge there had beenwithdrawn. The church seemed closed, its windows and doors boarded up.‘Come on,’ said Chris, beckoning that we should follow. ‘There’s something Iwant to show you.’He led us along a zigzag footpath that ran down the side of the hill beneath thechurch until we came to what seemed to be the mouth of a cave. Blocking our wayfurther was an uncompromisingly locked, thick-barred steel gate.Chris gestured between the bars: ‘Take a look in there,’ he suggested. ‘I thinkyou’ll find it very weird.’I did. It was.‘What is it? I asked.‘Nobody knows for sure. The official view is that it was made by earlyChristians – that it could have been some sort of secret church. But a lot ofstuff they can’t explain here gets attributed to the early Christians.’I was peering through the bars. What I could make out in the shadowy recessesbeyond seemed to be a roughly circular, very high chamber. And in the centre ofthe chamber, standing on a broad base, were huge tapering pillars soaring upinto the gloom above. Room, walkway, pillars and ceiling were all carved out ofthe solid bedrock of the hillside. Chris was still talking: ‘Here in Malta oncethe archaeologists say something is early Christian then everyone stops thinkingabout it.’‘Obviously you don’t think it’s early Christian.’‘Do you know, a few years ago there were exceptionally heavy rains. A lot ofwater pooled on the flat ground up above at the top of the hill. Then suddenly avery strange hole opened in the ground and the same moment a huge pile of rubbledropped through into this chamber. It took a week to clear it out. But it wasn’ta natural collapse. The hole turned out to be a triangular man-made shaft, witheach side of the triangle measuring about half a metre, and it ran verticallyabout 20 metres through the ceiling of the chamber and all the way to the top ofthe hill. It had been blocked and filled up over time …’‘So …’‘So I just don’t see any reason why early Christians – or any Christians -wouldhave gone to the trouble to make something like that. What it sounds like to meis ancient astronomy.’I nodded. Such a shaft, like any vertical shaft, would have marked the biannualzenith passage of the sun – here with a spectacular glowing triangle at middayon the floor of the chamber. And it would have made a splendid fixed telescopeat night for observing stars at the zenith.But what also interested me was the further hint that the shaft and the chamberoffered of advanced rock-cutting and tunnelling abilities amongst the ancientMaltese – abilities of which the Hypogeum may only represent a fraction. Indeed,there have long been rumours that a vast network of tunnels and passageways ofunknown origin exists beneath Malta. And at the beginning of World War II, soonbefore the islands came under heavy attack from the German and Italian AirForces, a rather odd report from a gung-ho American cyclist named Richard Walterappeared in the obsessively fact-checked National Geographic magazine. Afterdescribing the Hypogeum (‘where prehistoric man worshipped his deities andburied his dead’) Walter wrote:While we cycled homeward, our friends told us that the island was honeycombedwith a network of underground passages, many of them catacombs. Years ago onecould walk underground from one end of Malta to another, but all entrances wereclosed up by the Government because of a tragedy. On a sightseeing trip,comparable to a nature-study trip in our own schools, a number of elementaryschool children and their teachers descended into the tunnelled maze and did notreturn. For weeks mothers declared that they had heard wailing and screamingfrom underground. But numerous excavations and searching parties brought notrace of the lost souls. After three weeks they were finally given up for dead.Sections of the underground network have been used to protect military and navalsupplies. Indeed many of the fortifications themselves are merely caps atop amaze of tunnels …5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn5]Just another urban legend? Or another tantalizing glimpse of Malta’s prehistoricunderworld?THE PENDULUM OF THE SUNMNAJDRA, 20 JUNE 2000Chris Micallef is around thirty years of age, stocky and dark, quite intense, atypical Maltese. He’s wearing a smart white shirt, open at the neck. He has aslightly professorial air, as though teaching comes naturally to him or is oftenexpected of him. And he knows a lot about astronomy. At our first meeting inNovember 1999 he and his father – the late Paul Micallef’s brother – showed me afilm they had been preparing for more than a decade which meticulously documentsthe impressive array of alignments that the massive Lower Temple of Mnjadra hason offer at different seasons of the year.I look at my watch. It’s already 5.50 a.m.‘Don’t worry,’ says Chris. ‘We won’t see the effect for about another twentyminutes.’ He points to the long sloping shoulder of the hill to our east, at thetop of which Hagar Qim is located. ‘Of course, nothing happens until the sun’sdisk begins to appear over the ridge.’‘So this isn’t exactly a sunrise alignment, then?’‘No. It’s much more clever and complicated than that. If the local horizon werecompletely flat, which it pretty much is up at Hagar Qim, the sun’s disk wouldhave already been in view for more than half an hour. But because we’re at thebottom of a hill and the hill lies east of us, we don’t see it down here yet. Soall the sunrise alignments for Mnajdra had to be calculated and observed by theancients against this sloping local horizon – not an easy thing to do.’But, nevertheless, a thing that was done. What happens is this: * As the sun crests the horizon on the spring and autumn equinoxes, 21 March and 21 September (when night and day are of equal length) its rays exactly bisect the huge trilithion entrance to Mnajdra’s Lower Temple, projecting a spot of light into a small shrine in the deepest recesses of the megalithic complex. * On the winter solstice (20/21 December, the shortest day) a very distinctive ‘slit-image’ – looking something like the illuminated silhouette of a poleaxe or a flag flying on a pole – is projected by the sun’s rays on to a large stone slab, estimated to weigh 2.5 tonnes,6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn6] standing to the rear of the west wall of the Lower Temple’s northern apse. * On the summer solstice (20/21 June, the longest day), the same distinctive slit-image appears – but now with the ‘flag’ oriented in the opposite direction – on a second large stone slab, this time weighing 1.6 tonnes standing to the rear of the west wall of the Lower Temple’s southern apse.‘And it works like that,’ Chris Micallef continues, ‘like a pendulum, sweepingleft to right, then right to left, back and forward throughout the year: summersolstice image to autumn equinox to winter solstice image, back to the springequinox, then to the summer solstice image again and the cycle starts over.There are further subdivisions also signalled by slit images for thecross-quarter days, mid-way between the solstices and the equinoxes, and for the“eighth days” mid-way between the cross-quarter days and the equinoxes on oneside and between the cross-quarter days and the solstices on the other.’[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_103_r1.jpg]Between the winter and summer solstices, the rays of the rising sun act like apendulum swinging between the north and south vertical stones (shaded) insidethe temple. On the equinoxes, the sun shines straight along Mnajdra’s east-westaxis. Based on Micallef (1992).Chris tells me about other alignments, notably some very precise lunaralignments that the temple also registers: ‘All in all, when we consider thehigh precision of Mnajdra’s alignments, and the many astronomical problems thatwere solved – way beyond what is required if the only objective was a simpleagricultural calendar – we have to conclude that full-time professionalobservers must have been at work here for many, many years. Then you have tothink about the problems of site-selection – and then many more years patientlyobserving to establish the required back-sights.’7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn7]‘So these guys were pretty sharp observers?’‘They were,’ said Chris. ‘And pretty sharp surveyors too.’‘And good engineers,’ I added. ‘They knew how to move and position the bigmegaliths.’‘And they had mathematical and measuring abilities … Come and see this … ‘Chris leads me up the slope to the small, south-facing trefoil temple on thenorthern side of the site, presumed to be the oldest in the Mnajdra complex. Onthe basis of exclusively Gigantija-phase pottery excavated here, it has beendated to c.3450 BC (as against c.2800 BC for the Lower Temple where mainlyTarxien-phase pottery was found). But Chris doesn’t want to talk about dates. Hewants to talk about ellipses.‘I’ve studied the elliptical forms of the temples mathematically,’ he says. ‘Andit seems that some kind of megalithic building or measuring unit was used. Itseems so.’We’re inside the trefoil temple now, which is indeed highly elliptical. ‘In factthis is the major axis, right?’ says Chris. ‘And this is the minor axis of theellipse. There is a property which says that if you take from that point to thecentre, and from here to here, and if you square this part plus this partsquared then that part comes equal to exactly half the major axis. Eventually itcomes. I’m not saying that they invented the Pythagoras theorem, but they haddiscovered it by chance, so that they could alter the eccentricity of thetemples as much as they wanted.’I tell Chris that a lot of this is going right over the top of my head, but hesays the main point is very simple. What it comes down to is that the people whobuilt the Mnajdra complex, and all the other megalithic temples on Malta, workedwith a fixed unit of measurement. This unit, of 0.83 metres, is identical to the‘megalithic yard’ identified by the Scottish archaeoastronomer Alexander Thornand found throughout megalithic sites that he had surveyed from Callanish innorthern Scotland to Carnac in Brittany.8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn8]‘I calculated the perimeter,’ Chris continues with a gesture, ‘and it comes outto whole numbers in megalithic yards. It is the same for all the ellipses,though they vary in eccentricity. So they had the facility to arrange theeccentricity of each temple to the precise extent they required and yet keep themeasurement of the perimeter in whole numbers of megalithic yards. Somehow thesekinds of mathematical concepts must have been in quite wide circulation in theancient world and were passed on from one society to another society, perhaps byseafarers. A possible harbourage has been suggested, right here below Mnajdra.And though there are no images of ships carved here, such images do appear atTarxien.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn9] So probably this kindof knowledge was passed on by word of mouth, and there was some kind of societythat this knowledge was passed on from and to … ‘‘And ships were part of it?’‘Yes.’‘Because this kind of accurate astronomy is also what you want for navigationreally. It’s the same skill.’‘That’s right,’ says Chris, but he sounds distracted. He is an engineer byprofession, and I can see that he is uncomfortable with speculation and prefersto stick with what he can measure and observe.Still, there is one other point – much more speculative than ancientnavigational skills – that I want to ask him about. When his late uncle wascompleting his analysis of the archaeoastronomy of the Lower Temple at Mnajdrahe had discovered something odd concerning the summer and winter solsticealignments.It is well known that the sun’s rising points at the solstices are not fixed butvary with the slowly increasing and then decreasing angle of the earth’s axis inrelation to the plane of its orbit around the sun. These changes in what isknown technically as the ‘obliquity of the ecliptic’ (presently in the range of23 degrees 27 minutes) unfold over a great cycle of more than 40,000 years andif alignments are sufficiently ancient they will incorporate a degree of error,caused by changing obliquity. From the error (assuming they were builtaccurately in the first place) it is possible to calculate the exact date oftheir construction.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn10]In the case of Mnajdra, the alignment today is good, but not quite perfectbecause (to take the example of the summer solstice) the rays that form theslit-image are projected two centimetres away from the edge of the large slab atthe rear of the temple. However, Paul Micallef’s calculations show that when theobliquity of the ecliptic stood at 24 degrees 9 minutes and 4 seconds thealignment would have been perfect with the slit-image forming exactly in linewith the edge of the slab. This ‘perfect’ alignment has occurred twice in thelast 15,000 years – once in 3700 BC (‘this is the first consideration of theMnajdra Temple’s age’, notes Paul Micallef)11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn11] and again, earlier, in 10,205 BC(‘this is the second consideration of the Mnajdra Temple’s age’).12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn12]But Chris doesn’t want to be drawn on the earlier date. He admits it’s a‘mathematical possibility’ but says he would prefer to stick with the orthodoxscheme of things: ‘The second age makes the temple 12,205 years old, which isabsurd when compared to archaeological history. In my view the archaeologicalcontext locking the temples in to the fourth and third millennia BC isreasonably good, so that’s the context I work with.’And he’s right. The archaeological context is reasonably good – in the sensethat no find, or at least none that have been officially logged, conclusivelydemonstrates that any of the temples are older than the fourth millennium BC.But, that being said, the archaeological context of the megalithic temples ofMalta is also, in another sense, appallingly, awfully bad.ANTEDILUVIAN TEMPLES OF THE GIANTS?The essential problem, repeated over and over again, is contamination of thecrime scene. Indeed, other than Skorba, which was thoroughly and professionallyexcavated by David Trump in the 1960s and which is partially built over the topof habitation layers predating the temple’s construction,13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn13] it seems that not a singlemegalithic temple on Malta has presented itself to archaeologists of thepost-radiocarbon era in a sealed and undisturbed condition. Although thisincludes Tarxien, which was excavated from 1915 onwards (still fifty yearsbefore calibrated radiocarbon), the superb stratigraphy and detailed site notesof the commendable Sir Temi Zammit do provide us with a reliable record there.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn14]The same cannot be said for the semi-subterranean Borchtorff Circle excavated atXaghra on Gozo between 1987 and 1994. It proved to have fallen victim to anearlier excavation in the 1820s by a certain Otto Beyer in the employ of theBritish Army, who very badly disturbed and redistributed the stratigraphy andkept no records.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn15]Likewise, Mnajdra was first excavated in 1840 by C. Lenormant, who kept norecords, followed by a mixed assortment of other diggers, then by Mayr at thebeginning of the twentieth century and then by Ashby, who excavated in 1910‘those parts which had not been completely ransacked by the originalexcavators’.16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn16]Hagar Qim has been constantly interfered with by treasurer hunters, amateurarchaeologists and self-appointed site-restorers from at least the eighteenthcentury onwards. Particularly extensive site clearance and restoration tookplace in 1839 on the orders of the then governor of Malta Sir Henry Bouverie.Only a short and extremely inadequate report accompanied by an inaccurate planwas prepared.17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn17]And at Gigantija excavations were begun in 1827, once again by Otto Bayer. Trueto form, he produced no report and did not preserve pottery and small finds.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn18] Oddly enough, however, the firstdescription of the monument following Beyer’s excavation (published in Parislater in 1827 by L. Mazzara) bore the title Temple antediluvien des Géants.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn19]CARBON-DATING MALTA: IS THE CHRONOLOGY SECURE?TAS SLIG, 25 JUNE 2001It is certainly the case that not a single carbon-date from Malta supports thepresence of any humans on these islands prior to 5200 BC, let alone the presenceof humans capable of building with megaliths. On the other hand, it must also beobserved that the general state of disrupted stratigraphy at the temples hasmade it difficult for archaeologists to obtain C-14 samples in contexts wherethey can unequivocally confirm the age of the megalithic ruins – and indeed toobtain C-14 samples at all.On 25 June 2001 I discussed these problems with the charming and affableProfessor Anthony Bonanno of the University of Malta on site at a dig he wassupervising at Tas Slig.GH: If we take the dating of a temple like Mnajdra or Hagar Qim, thebetter-known temples, how many samples of carbon-datable material would thedating be based on?Bonanno: Nothing at all.GH: Nothing at all?Bonanno: Hagar Qim and Mnajdra were cleared rather than excavated in thenineteenth century, and no proper records were kept, and the excavation methodswere far from scientific. So no biological material was kept that could becarbon-dated.GH: Right. Does that apply to Gigantija too?Bonanno: That applies to Gigantija as well, yes.GH: Right. In general, are the megalithic temples founded very close to bedrock,or are they founded on an earth layer on top of the bedrock?Bonanno: You can tell that in the Maltese context, all stone buildings lie onbedrock. The cover, earth cover, is very shallow … and then, of course, you needa really solid base.GH: But how would they – sorry, this may seem like an ignorant question – but ifthey put the megaliths on bedrock, how do they make them stand up? Don’t theyhave to bed them into earth or something?Bonanno: Right. It doesn’t mean that the uprights of the temple stand onbedrock. In fact this is another difference between the construction techniqueof our temples and say the construction techniques of Stonehenge. There, thestanding megaliths are inserted into the ground. Here, a platform is normallyprepared consisting of megaliths, but horizontal megaliths, and it is on top ofthose that the lower uprights of the temple are placed.GH: I see. And the platform itself is on bedrock?Bonanno: The platform itself is on bedrock.GH: Interesting, interesting. Have any samples been taken from underneath amegalith?Bonanno: From underneath a megalith? I don’t remember any samples being takenfrom underneath megaliths.GH: What’s troubling me is with the megalithic temples founded on bedrock andtherefore no possibility of strata under the temple itself, how sure can we beabout the contemporaneity of the organic samples that can be carbon-dated andthe construction of the site? It doesn’t worry you about the dating of themegalithic structures themselves?Bonanno: Not really, because anything underneath the megalith could be as old as100,000 years. What, as an archaeologist, I would want to find is a stratum, alayer, which would be touching on, therefore sealing, a wall or part of a wall,because that is what would be telling me the date of the wall itself. Anythingbelow could be as old as ever.GH: Is there any megalithic temple in Malta where you have sealed securecarbon-dates from layers like that?Bonanno: Skorba, yes, Skorba and the Xaghra [Borchtorff] Circle.I’m not an archaeologist, but as a journalist it seems to me we are left with anawful lot of temples for which we have no carbon-dates at all and certainly nosealed secure ones. Worse still, the complete repertoire of radiocarbon-datesfor the prehistory of the Maltese islands, upon which so many of our notions ofthe origins and chronology of its megalithic civilization depend, is, overall,extremely limited. I was surprised to discover that there are only twenty-sevenofficial C-14 dates for the entire archipelago and that most of these are ofequivocal quality. Moreover, twenty-two of the twenty-seven dates come from onlytwo sites – eight from Skorba and fourteen from the Borchtorff Circle.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn20] Of the remaining five, one comesfrom Mgarr and is relatively secure, being wood charcoal retrieved from theunder the floor. Logically, however, the most that it can tell us is the age ofthe floor itself – which may have been a restoration. It has no bearing on theage of the megalithic uprights since the excavator -J. D. Evans in 1954 –informs us that the sample was found just above the level on which the wallfoundations were resting.21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn21]Prehistoric Malta’s final four carbon-dates out of its grand total oftwenty-seven are from Tarxien.22 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn22]Of these, one is wood charcoal from the first apse to the right in the SouthTemple. The remaining three are all described as ‘carbonized beans from cineraryurns’. On further investigation it transpires that these samples were found inglass jars in the National Museum of Malta labelled ‘Tarxien Cemetery’, whichwere assumed to contain the contents of cinerary urns excavated by Temi Zammitin 1915.23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn23]Despite some significant anomalies and inconsistencies,24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn24] I want to emphasize again thatnone of these C-14 samples undermine – and all generally support – the orthodoxchronology of the rise and fall of Malta’s unique temple-building culture. Noris it my purpose here to challenge that chronology – at any rate, notnecessarily with reference to the temples that survive above water. But I dothink that in too small a field monopolized by too small a group ofarchaeologists, too much has been claimed for too long on the basis of toolittle data. In consequence, the ‘out of Sicily’ hypothesis that ignores thePalaeolithic has thrived, and its supporters – quite naturally – have focusedwhatever scarce archaeological resources may be available on the search forfurther evidence to elaborate and confirm an exclusively Neolithic heritage forMalta.So I don’t mind too much when the surviving megalithic temples were built. Thecounter-hypothesis that I offer for their origins is that they are theend-result of a very long process of development in Malta that began in thePalaeolithic and that has been veiled from us by rising sea-levels, cataclysmicland subsidence, academic mendacity and a self-protecting old boys’ club closingranks.A GOD OF LIGHT AND GEOMETRYMNAJDRA, 20 JUNE 2001It’s just after 6.05 a.m. and we are all gathered inside the northern apse ofthe lower temple, waiting for the sun to project an image on to the massive slab-the summer solstice stone – to the left of the central passageway in thesouthern apse. The image will be formed, Chris Micallef has explained, when halfthe solar disk is above the sloping natural horizon of the ridge. At that momentthe sun’s rays, coming out of the north-east, will pass through the trilithiongateway, striking the inside edge of its northern upright and the underside ofthe lintel, thence diagonally across the entrance passage to strike the insideedge of a megalith at the south-west end of the passage, and finally across thesouthern apse to strike the summer solstice stone – in our epoch 2 centimetresfrom its southern edge. So the ‘slit’ through which the rays pass to form theprojected image is not simply a gap in the masonry but a result of the carefuljuxtaposition of three different megaliths, two upright – but more than 4 metresapart at opposite ends of the entrance passage – and the third horizontal andmore than 2 metres off the ground.The morning light is mellow, warm, no harsh edges yet. There’s still some pinkof dawn left in the sky. And the moon, almost full, floats high and pale above agreat menhir that projects like a finger out of the south-west wall.‘We should see the effect very soon,’ announces Chris. ‘And I would ask you toremember that it has maybe only a hundredth of the impact that it would have hadin antiquity when the temple was fully roofed and dark inside. So you should tryto imagine the effect suddenly materializing in a place of darkness.’A few more minutes pass. I know what I should be looking out for and where Ishould see it, but I don’t see it yet. And in the back of my mind I’m absorbingChris’s point about the roof, wondering how we can expect to see anythingspecial at all under the present conditions. Isn’t there already way too muchlight inside the roofless temple for what is, after all, an effect composedentirely of light? Won’t it just wash out against the bright background?Then I become aware of … a presence – a faint, ghostly glimmering, likemoonglow, that has appeared on the solstice stone. I don’t know how long itlasts, a second or two only I would guess, but while it is there it seems lesslike a projection – which I know it to be – than something immanent within thestone itself. And it seems to function as a herald for it fades almost as soonas it has appeared and in its place the full effect snaps on – instantaneously.It wasn’t there, and then it’s there.As Chris had described, the effect does curiously resemble a poleaxe, or a flagon a pole, and consists of a ‘shaft’, narrow at the base but widening a littletowards the top, running up the left hand side of the solstice stone, surmountedby a right-facing ‘head’ or ‘flag’. An instant later an almond-shaped spot oflight, like an eye, appears a few centimetres to the right of the ‘flag’ and theeffect is complete.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_104_r1.jpg]A clear slit image is formed by the sun’s rays shining on the vertical stonesinside the temple. Based on Micallef (1992).Weirdly – I do not claim it has any significance – this flag-on-a-pole symbol isthe ancient Egyptian hieroglyph neter, meaning ‘god’, or ‘a god’ – and not to beunderstood at all in the Judaeo-Christian usage of that word but rather as areference to one of the supernatural powers or principals that guide and balancethe universe.Manifested here, in this strange Stone Age temple, it glows, as though lit byinner fire.THE CAVE AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFMARFA POINT, 22 JUNE 2001, DIVE 1We made three dives, two at the sites off Marfa Point in the north-west of theisland that had been found by Rupert and Audrey Mifsud and one at the QawraPoint site in the north-east found by Chris Agius.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_105_r1.jpg]My storm god had taken a break, the day was calm and beautiful, and our diveswere safe and unthreatening in seas entirely free of currents and waves. Also,for the first time ever in Malta, we just jumped in the water and went to thesuspected man-made sites without any of the fruitless searching withecho-sounders and wasted hours zig-zagging backward and forward that I had cometo regard as normal here.First Rupert led us over a level area covered in fields of waving sea-grasssloping down gently from 7 to about 10 metres. Then we came to the edge of asheer underwater cliff dropping 15 metres to the sea-bed below. There welaunched ourselves into blue space and drifted down the side of the drop-offlike slow motion skydivers.At the bottom, at 25 metres and in the sudden cold of a thermocline, was theopening to a cave. A very strange cave. I have never seen one like it before.Its entrance was, I suppose, about 5 metres wide at the base and soared,narrowing, to half the height of the drop-off where the two sides came togetherto make the roof. Inside, I found that the floor of the cave was not horizontalbut rose from the sea-bed at an angle of about 45 degrees forming, effectively,a steep ramp. The surface of the ramp, though overgrown, was surprisingly smoothand it was difficult to see how such a feature could have formed naturally in asetting like this. Besides, now that my eyes were becoming accustomed to thegloom, and in the beam of light from Rupert’s torch, I could see that some areasappeared to have been deliberately cut and quarried into shape.Cave diving can be scary if the cave you are in is part of a system with manyside branches, like a maze, or if it is so long that you cease to see the lightfiltering through the entrance behind you. But what makes caves reallydangerous, and the reason that they regularly kill divers, is sediment.Some years ago in Yonaguni, Japan, where I dive regularly, four leisure diversand an instructor were killed by sediment – not killed by it directly, ofcourse, but killed by it because their finning stirred up centuries of siltpiled on the cave-floor into a thick suspended mist. In it they becamedisoriented, confused and, tragically, could not find the exit before they ranout of air.But this cave in Malta was not like that. It entrance was so wide and the caveitself so relatively shallow that it would be impossible to get lost in it, evenin the worst conditions. Nevertheless, it was silty and the visibility wasdeteriorating steadily despite all our efforts.About 5 metres inside, up near the top of the ramp, Rupert showed me what we hadcome to see – three large steps, or terraces, each about half a metre high andextending across the entire width of the cave. They were deeply covered inmarine growth and layers of sediment but they seemed to be much toostraight-edged and right-angled to have been shaped by any natural process-especially in such a sheltered position.Two or 3 metres beyond them the cave terminated in a wall penetrated by a gaplarge enough for me to pass through – which I did without hesitation, since Icould see light streaming in from the other side. The gap led to a second cave,in an entirely rough and natural state, with its own separate entrance. I swamback through the gap again and returned to the steps which, by now, wereenshrouded in a fog of sediment.Man-made, or natural? It certainly looked to me as though people had been atwork in this cave cutting and shaping the rock to some design or plan of theirown – as they had been over the millennia in Malta in so many caves andunderground tunnels.I allowed myself to float up to the roof, an easy move for a diver but somethingthat would have been impossible without scaffolding when the cave was abovewater. Yet the roof of the cave was nicely cut and squared off, presenting anextremely symmetrical ‘frame’ of two verticals and a horizontal upright.UNDERWATER CLAPHAM JUNCTIONMARFA POINT, 22 JUNE 2001, DIVE 2Our second dive at Marfa Point was on what Rupert called ‘the channels’. Theywere located on the plateau above the drop-off at a depth of about 8 metres andwere immediately recognizable as part of the same phenomenon as theunquestionably man-made ‘cart-ruts’ at Clapham Junction and other above-waterlocations on Malta.But there were some differences.Firstly, these ruts were a good bit wider and deeper than the ruts at ClaphamJunction. It was possible to get my whole body down horizontally into most ofthem and to swim along inside them for distances of 20 metres or so beforereaching a break.Secondly, although most ran in parallel pairs as though left by cart-wheels,exactly as at Clapham Junction, there were indeed several single ‘channels’ evenwider and deeper than the others.Thirdly, in places where I managed to strip away the thick sea-grass coveringthe bottom of a rut I came across an extremely odd feature. About twice as wideat the base as the average ruts at Clapham Junction, these proved everywhere Isearched to be divided into two ‘lanes’ by a knife-edged ridge of limestoneabout a hand’s-breadth high that had been left in place running the full lengthof the rut. In my view there can be no question of this being a natural feature.It is definitely man-made.Fourthly, the top of the ruts at Clapham Junction lie flush with the bedrock.Here underwater, although the interior of the ruts had been cut down into thebedrock in the same way, the sides of the ruts also rose about 30 centimetresabove the level of the surrounding bedrock – like low, narrow parallel walls.As at Clapham Junction all these features appeared to have been hewn out of thesolid bedrock by tools, and not to have been worn down by centuries or millenniaof abrasion.As at Clapham Junction I also found one place where a pair of ruts wasinterrupted by what almost seemed like a roadway running transverse to them. Theruts stopped completely on one side of the ‘roadway’, which had been cut throughthem and thus obliterated them at this point, and then resumed their course onthe other. The obvious implications of this state of affairs were that thetransverse road had been made after the ruts and that the ruts may thereforehave already been ancient when they were submerged.As at Clapham Junction these ruts didn’t seem to be coming from anywhere inparticular or going to anywhere in particular. Some of them did lead in generaltowards the edge of the drop-off but vanished completely into the sea-grassbefore reaching it.CANALQAWRA POINT, 22 JUNE 2001, DIVE 3Diving and filming are both activities that require a lot of time, preparationand messing around with equipment, so it was nearly three in the afternoonbefore we were finished at Marfa Point and after four when we reached QawraPoint on the other side of the island.Chris Agius put on his scuba gear while we were anchoring and jumped in torelocate and mark the site before we went down to it. And since this was one ofthose very rare days in Malta when everything went right he was back up withinfive minutes waving success.We descended to a flat, rocky bottom at a depth of about 18 metres and, thoughit was overgrown as usual with thick sea-grass, I could see the level plainextend to the limits of visibility on all sides of me. It seemed completelynatural. But moments later Chris brought us to a clear, clean gap in thesea-grass caused by a channel – perhaps something more like a canal really –that ran straight for tens of metres through the bedrock. A little over 2 metresdeep and about the same wide, its floor consisted of pure, white, level sand.But how thick was the sand? I pushed my gloved hand experimentally down into ituntil had it had disappeared beyond my wrist. It was deeper than that, possiblya lot deeper. But it would take airlift equipment to find out for sure.The walls of the canal were cut down vertically into the bedrock on each sideand did, very strongly, give the impression of being artificially formed.Chris and I swam along the bottom of the canal side by side – there was room todo that – for 20 or 30 metres until we came to the place he wanted to show me.Here the canal was spanned by a ‘bridge’ flat on top and level with thesurrounding plain. It too was a rock-hewn feature – a narrow section of theoriginal bedrock that had simply been left in place when the canal was formed,and then hollowed out underneath into an archway through which the contents ofthe canal could flow.We swam under the arch several times and Chris pointed out how the vertical sidewalls bore what looked like tool marks. I agreed with him. And again I foundmyself looking at something underwater that could not easily be explained asnatural. For whereas arches, sometimes on a very grand scale, are found beneaththe sea, they almost always prove to be part of collapsed cave systems. That wasnot the case here, for we were in open underwater country – that would have beenopen country before its submergence – and because this arch crossed adead-straight 2 metre deep channel that was completely out of character witheverything else that nature had succeeded in doing in the vicinity.Last but not least, the canal proved to run due north-south – an orientationsignificant to humans but not to nature.THE MISSING PIECE OF THE JIGSAW PUZZLEAnton Mifsud cites the underwater channels around Malta as further evidence forhis thesis that this was ‘Plato’s island’, since canals or channels also featureprominently in Plato’s description of Atlantis.Mifsud’s proposal, as we’ve seen, is that the world-famous story of thedestruction of Atlantis in a ‘single dreadful day and a night’ that Platorecounted at the beginning of the fourth century BC is an echo, or folk memory,of massive destruction wrought on Malta in 2200 BC by a fault collapse along thesubmarine Pantalleria Rift. He notes that Malta today has a pronounced‘wedge-like’ tilt from south-west (the thick end of the wedge, e.g., thetowering coastal cliffs at Dingli and Maghlaq) to the north-east (where the thinend of the wedge disappears under the sea, as at Sliema). This tilt has comeabout because Malta lies very close to the tectonic collision front between theAfrican and Eurasian continental plates:25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn25]The upwarped shoulders of the Pantalleria Rift bear the Pelagian islands ofLampedusa and Lampione on the western shoulder and the Maltese islands on theeastern one. The still active shoulder up warping on both sides of thePantalleria Rift causes the tilting. As the island of Lampedusa continues totilt southerly, the Maltese islands tilt in a complementary manner towards thenortheast …26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn26]This is the underlying geological process that created the sheer cliffs ofsouthwest Malta, themselves forming the edge of an exposed fault-line atMaghlaq, near Mnajdra. And as Mifsud points out, the nature of the process makesit highly likely that Malta may once have extended much further to thesouth-west of Maghlaq than it does today (a continuation of the ‘thick end ofthe wedge’ on the up warping shoulder of the Rift). He proposes the cataclysmiccollapse of this hypothetical south-western extension 4200 years ago as theexplanation for the mystery of the sudden and apparently overnight extinction ofMalta’s age-old temple-building culture at the same date:Tectonic movements in the Central Mediterranean are still responsible for thecontinuing separation of the two shoulders of the rift, respectively bearing theMaltese islands on the northeast and the Pelagian group on the southwestshoulder. It is far from inconceivable that [a] landmass joined to the southwestcoast of Malta, at the Maghlaq site would have collapsed and submerged at apoint in time when its underlying structures gave way to the rifting process.Such a collapse would have occasioned the displacement of massive volumes ofseawater on the southwestern coastline, with a rapidly flowing torrentialflooding event along a SW to NE direction.27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn27]It is this deluge that Mifsud proposes as the source of the grisly avalanche ofjumbled and disarticulated skeletons washed out of Neolithic graveyards and intothe Hypogeum 4200 years ago, and for the metre-thick deposit of silt that wasdumped inside the Tarxien temples at the same time. And while I cannot agreewith Anton that the same deluge and instantaneous loss of a large part ofsouth-western Malta was also the source of the Atlantis myth, his notion of acataclysmic fault collapse in this area is highly plausible and in full accordwith the geological evidence. In addition, since Mifsud’s hypotheticalsouth-western extension to Malta would have been created by tectonic motionalong the Pantalleria Rift and destroyed by the same forces, it would haveremained invisible to Glenn Milne’s inundation-mapping programme which,explicitly, does not account for tectonic motion.For the purposes of my own quest, the single most intriguing aspect of Mifsud’shypothesis is that it permits Malta to have retained a large extension in thesouth-west down to 4200 years ago – i.e. more than 6000 years after the end ofthe post-glacial floods that had earlier been responsible for the inundation ofhuge areas to the north and east (see chapter 19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c19_r1.htm#c19]). In the search for the experimentaland ‘learning’ phases of Malta’s megalithic temples during the long gap betweenthe end of the post-glacial floods 10,600 years ago and the ‘sudden’ appearanceof the Gigantija phase 5600 years ago, I therefore suggest that we could hardlydo better than begin to look here.Moreover, and again entirely beyond the data and resolution capabilities ofGlenn Milne’s maps, there are the knock-on tectonic effects throughout Malta andGozo that would have been caused by a massive collapse of up warped lands. Manyadjustments of the coastline may have occurred that we will never have anyknowledge of.What is certain, however – although the rates are unpredictable – is thecontinued stealthy emergence in the upwardly warping south-west and thecontinued stealthy submergence of the north-east Maltese coast. The particularimplication of this process is that sites in the north-east shown on theinundation maps to have been submerged by 10,600 years ago may not in fact havebeen submerged until much later, when Malta’s tilt forced them under. Ittherefore follows that the inundated north-east, off-shore of Sliema, alsoremains a prime candidate for the missing archaeological remains of earlierphases of Malta’s temple-building culture.BROKEN IMAGESI have grossly oversimplified Anton Mifsud’s theory of a fault collapse alongthe Pantalleria Rift and left out much of the detailed empirical evidence thatsustains the theory and dates the collapse to 2200 BC. Readers wishing to pursuethe matter further are referred to his own book on this subject, Echoes ofPlato’s Island, which presents the case more thoroughly than I am able toattempt here.28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn28] I do, however,want to draw attention to one particular category of supporting evidence thatMifsud includes in Echoes. Unlike his geological and geophysical evidence thismaterial is very hard to measure and assess and might be considered highlyspeculative. Nevertheless, I believe that it may prove to be of the greatestimportance.In their research, Mifsud and his co-authors came across recurrent references intraditions and classical geographies and maps to a formerly much larger Malta.For example: ‘Some medieval maps do not speak of Malta, but of a certainGaulometin or Galonia leta, and combine Malta and Gozo into one big island.’29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn29]We know from Glenn Milne’s inundation data that Gozo and Malta were indeed onebig island during the Ice Age, down to approximately 13,500 years ago, and thatthey did not take on their present form as an archipelago of three islands (withlittle Comino in between) until around 11,000 years ago. Accordingly, if themedieval tradition of Malta and Gozo as one big island is not a completeinvention – and why should it be? – then, ‘fantastic’ though it may seem, itsomehow preserves a memory of Malta as it appeared more than 11,000 years ago.It is well known that most medieval mapmakers were only copyists reproducingolder maps and, for reasons that we will explore in Part 5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_p05_r1.htm#p05], I believe we cannot exclude thepossibility that the single large island called Gaulometin or Galonia leta thathas somehow survived on certain medieval maps may indeed be a representation ofMalta in a much earlier time.30 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn30]A mental leap is required in order even to consider such a possibility. It isnecessary to set aside all preconceptions about the past, and all unexaminednotions of how societies evolve. Above all, we have to rid ourselves of theingrained conviction that (despite some setbacks) the basic story of humancivilization has been steadily and reassuringly onwards and upwards from thevery beginning.It may not have been so. There may be tremendous gaps, of which we areblissfully unaware, in the evidence presently available to us concerning theorigins and progress of civilization. In particular, there has been no sustainedor serious search for very ancient underwater ruins along the millions of squarekilometres of continental shelves flooded at the end of the Ice Age.So it is possible, and within the bounds of reason, that a civilization of somesort might have flourished during the closing millennia of the Ice Age and mightnot yet have been detected by archaeologists. A civilization not necessarily atall like our own but still advanced enough to have mastered complex skills suchas seafaring and navigation (that do not call for a large material or industrialbase) and to have left behind memories of the world as it looked before theflood and at various stages during the rising of the seas. The sort ofcivilization, perhaps, that would have built with megaliths and aligned themwith navigational precision to the path of the sun. Maybe even a civilizationthat measured the earth, mapped it and netted it with a latitude and longitudegrid.Until such a lost civilization has been entirely ruled out – and we are far fromthat – it is rational to keep our minds open to the possibility, howeverextraordinary it may seem, that certain ancient maps have indeed carried down tous broken images of the antediluvian world.Thus Mifsud is right to be intrigued that:A southern extension of the Maltese islands … is recorded in the annals ofClaudius Ptolemy, the renowned ancient geographer, mathematician and astronomer… He had unlimited access to the ancient documents in the Alexandrine library,and his research included the Mediterranean and Maltese islands. Although hisreadings outside the Mediterranean were sometimes erroneous, his Mediterraneanlatitudes in particular were significantly accurate.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn31]Ptolemy (C.AD 90–168) carried out his geographical research at the fabledlibrary of Alexandria in Egypt, the most extensive archive of ancient texts thenpreserved anywhere in the world. Is it possible that he, too, was drawing onantediluvian sources with his uncharacteristically ‘inaccurate’ references to aformerly larger Malta?What is particularly noticeable about Ptolemy’s coordinates, Mifsuddemonstrates, is that they extend Malta significantly into the sea to the southand west of the present coastline in the vicinity of Filfla – exactly where hebelieves that massive land-loss occurred through catastrophic faulting 4200years ago.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn32]The crucial point [is] that Ptolemy gave co-ordinates for Malta which extendedover twenty minutes of latitude (between 34°45’ and 34°25’). He was thereforeattributing a maximum latitude width for Malta alone of at least 30.82kilometres. This measurement today is approximately 21.5 kilometres, so that itis evident that in the ancient sources researched by Ptolemy, the Malteseislands still extended southward significantly more than today.33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn33]Maps drawn in late medieval and early Renaissance times from Ptolemy’s originalcoordinates contain a variety of anomalies that may also reflect the sameancient sources. For example: ‘An early world map of Ptolemy [Ulm 1482] shows alarge unidentified island in the central Mediterranean.’34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn34] Although displaced too far tothe east, this large unidentified island bears a strong resemblance to Malta asit would have looked 14,600 years ago, shortly after it first became isolatedfrom Sicily. A similar island is clearly shown on the Ptolemaic world map inEbner’s manuscript of 1460.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_106_r1.jpg]The Ptolemaic map in Ebner’s manuscript of AD 1460 shows a large ghost islandsouth-east of Sicily. Similar islands are also seen on the Klosterneuberg of AD1450 (which appears to merge the Maltese islands into a single landmass) and theUlm of AD 1482.Another map, reputedly copied ‘from ancient sources’ at Klosterneuberg, Austria,in AD 1450, shows a ‘significant landmass between Sicily and North Africa’.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c20-ftn35] Again, the possibility that thisis a reverberation of ancient information about Malta’s former extent, even ifdistorted through the passage of time, cannot in my view be ruled out.Malta in this respect is far from unique, but stands as the representative of awider problem that we will return to in Part 5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_p05_r1.htm#p05].TANTALUSBALLUTA BAY, 25 JUNE 2001On the very last evening of our June 2001 filming trip to Malta for Channel 4,Anton Mifsud arranged for us to meet Shaun Arrigo. We hadn’t seen him since ourdisastrous dives in November 1999 and I wanted to clear up the misunderstandingsthat had occurred between us then. Fortunately, this proved easy to do and,thanks to Anton, we passed the evening in the bar of the Lapsi Waterfront Hotelwith a new mood of trust and cooperation in the air.As we talked it emerged that Shaun had been back to the Sliema ‘temple’ siteseveral times. Working in a team with Anton Mifsud and other colleagues, he hadalso filmed a second submerged site in the same general vicinity (which thegroup had named Janet-Johann site after the discoverers). ‘Do you want to seeit?’ he asked. ‘I’ve brought the tape along with me, if anyone’s got a playerand a TV.’Our producer Stefan Wickham offered the facilities of his room and we allcrowded upstairs to watch the video.It became obvious, within moments, that the Janet-Johann site was of greatinterest. At depths of between 10 and 15 metres off Sliema Arrigo’s footageshowed a series of very large, almost ‘monumental’ canals and parallel‘cart-ruts’ much wider and deeper than those we had seen at Marfa and Qawra.Some of the canals cut through the bedrock in perfectly straight horizontallines for more than 100 metres without any break. Then, beyond them, the cameracame suddenly into an area of huge scattered megaliths. All were fallen exceptone which stood partially upright leaning at a drunken angle.‘I found a piece of pottery round there,’ Arrigo told us. ‘It was lodged in afissure, and very worn and ancient. I retrieved it and took it to the NationalMuseum, but they just weren’t interested – told me I could keep it.’‘And did you tell them about this site as well?’ I asked, indicating the imageson the TV screen.‘Yes I did. I told them I thought it was a very suspicious, veryman-made-looking place. I offered to lend them the tape or guide someone fromthe Museum there.’‘And?’‘Same story. They weren’t interested. In fact they seemed rather annoyed withme. They’ve been annoyed with me ever since the publicity in 1999 and I stilldon’t understand why.’There was no time on that trip for us to take a look at the new Sliema site withArrigo – besides he himself was leaving for Italy the next morning. So we agreedthat he would dive it again later in the summer on contract to us and shoot moredetailed and more extensive tape of what he’d found there. Then we would decidewhat to do about it – although frankly, with a book to write, I did not seemyself getting back to Malta to pursue the Sliema temple any time soon.I felt like Tantalus, the thirsty Greek king whose fate it was to stand for everup to his neck in water that receded whenever he tried to drink it."},{"pageContent":"PART FIVEANCIENT MAPS"},{"pageContent":"21 / TERRA INCOGNITAMarinus of Tyre seems to have been the most recent of our students of geographiaand to have applied himself to the subject with the greatest enthusiasm … If wecould see that his latest composition lacked nothing, we should even have beenhappy to complete our description of the known world from these notes of hisalone, without researching any further. But as on certain points he himselfseems to have composed without reliable comprehension, and as in embarking onhis map he has in many places not devoted enough thought either to convenienceor to symmetry, we were naturally induced to contribute to his work what seemednecessary to make it more logical and useful.Claudius Ptolemy (c. AD 90–168)From the outset portolan charts appear to have been remarkably accurate withlittle evolutionary development from the earliest-known examples to the latercharts made towards the end of the seventeenth century.John GossMaps of the Mediterranean drawn in the fifteenth century AD, according to atable of coordinates devised by the Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy inthe second century AD, show the Maltese archipelago as a single large island,much as it looked in the thirteenth millennium BC … Ptolemy, as we will see,based himself on an earlier geographer, Marinus of Tyre – a Phoenician – who inturn had drawn on even older maps and geographical knowledge.How far back in the human story does the quest for geographical knowledge go?And for how long – either in actual maps and charts, or in tables ofcoordinates, or in verbal accounts and ‘word-pictures’ of coastlines andjourneys – has such knowledge been preserved and promulgated by navigators?There has been debate since the 1950s about the significance of certain mapsfrom the late Middle Ages and the Age of Discovery that appear to show Ice Agetopography and coastlines – rather than the world as it looked when the mapswere drawn. Could these maps have been copied from older source maps that hademanated, ultimately, from a lost civilization of the Ice Age?I first touched on this mystery in Fingerprints of the Gods. But that was in theearly 1990s, before I knew about the science of inundation mapping or had beenable to explore the hidden world that it revealed. As the new information fromGlenn Milne began to come in during the last quarter of 2000, therefore, I setmy research assistant Sharif Sakr the task of reopening the investigation -witha brief to stay away from anomalies that I had already discussed in Fingerprintsand to look only for good, new correlations between the ancient maps and theinundation data now at our disposal. We agreed that this would be a long-termproject that should run continuously in the background while Sharif attended tomany other day-to-day research matters for me. I warned him that I wouldsometimes have to take him off the maps for weeks at a time to work on moreurgent and immediate issues.THE REINAL MAP OF 1510I was in India when Sharif e-mailed me in February 2001 with news of his firstsignificant ‘hit’ – an early sixteenth-century Portuguese map of the IndianOcean (the Reinal map of 1510), that appears to show the west coast of India asit looked more than 15,000 years ago. Sharif’s e-mail discussing therelationship of the Reinal map to other maps of the early sixteenth century, andsetting out the initial details of the correlation, is reproduced in chapter 14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14].I didn’t hear from him again on the subject of Reinal for several months. Thenin August 2001 he sent me an update:Sharif Sakr to Graham Hancock10 August 2001Large photos of the Reinal map of 1510 and Cantino map of 1502 have finallyarrived from the Bodleian. Not only do they support the correlation I describedin my e-mail of 23 Feb but they also suggest that the correlation is even moredetailed than I thought -particularly with India at 11,500 BC (not at the LGM,as considered before).Before detailing the correlation, there are a couple of things I need to explainabout the correlation I described on 23 Feb.Firstly, I suggested that Reinal’s map of India omits the Kathiawar peninsulaand the Gulfs of Kutch and Cambay that flank this peninsula, such that itcorrelates with Milne‘s maps of India before sea-levels had risen to today’slevels. The omission of the peninsula is evidently true from the map itself, andI stand by it. But from looking at the maps of Reinal’s contemporaries (such asthe Cantino 1502 and the Ribiero 1519), I suspect that if we could ask Reinal,Why haven’t you drawn this important peninsula?’ he would reply, ‘I have,’ andpoint to a specific peninsula on his map, far away from where the Kathiawarpeninsula actually exists. Relative to the surrounding geography, this featureis much too far north and west to be the Kathiawar peninsula, and it’s on thewrong side of the Indus river. Nevertheless, this feature was erroneouslyassociated with the Kathiawar peninsula on the Cantino and labelled ‘Camba’ –i.e. Cambay, which is the name given on modern maps to the long gulf on thesouth-east side of the Kathiawar peninsula. Reinal may well have made the samemistake. As to where this false ‘Camba’ peninsula comes from, the answer isquite clear: it comes from the older Ptolemaic model of India, which was highlyinaccurate.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_107_r1.jpg]Waldseemüller’s Ptolemaic map of India.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_108_r1.jpg]Modern map of the Pakistani coast.Though Reinal’s map of India is mostly superb for its time, the north-westernpart is very inaccurate between the Persian Gulf and the Indus river because itclosely follows the old Ptolemaic model – rather than the mysterious anddistinctly non-Ptolemaic source which I speculate was responsible for the restof India’s coastlines on the Cantino and Reinal maps. That is why Reinal repeatsthe false north-western peninsula that is shown on Ptolemaic maps (such asWaldseemüller’s 1507 shown above).The position, shape and orientation of the false Ptolemaic ‘Camba’ peninsula, asshown on the Reinal, plus the little island beside it, correlate well with thepeninsula on which the modern city of Karachi is situated, although the scale isvastly exaggerated. This exaggeration may have originated in the reports ofAlexander the Great’s sea-captain, Nearchus, who sailed back from the Industowards the Persian Gulf and made specific mention of coastal features and asupposedly ‘haunted’ island along the way.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_109_r1.jpg]Reinal’s map of India, AD 1510.The Reinal map departs from the Ptolemaic model specifically at the Indus delta(where Alexander stopped and turned back for home) and then southwards along theentire Indian coastline. As I said before, this coastline is infinitely moreaccurate than the Ptolemaic model, and strongly suggests that the source fromwhich it is derived was far superior to anything previously available to Westernseafarers and mapmakers. This coastline also correlates extremely well withMilne’s inundation maps showing India’s coastlines before about 12,000 yearsago.Of particular note is Reinal’s depiction of four small groups of islands, allclose to India’s shoreline and all south of the NW bulge that should have beenthe Kathiawar peninsula. No such islands exist today, but Milne’s maps suggestthat there were islands – including one very large one – in roughly the samepositions, down to about 10,000 years ago.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_110_r1.jpg]India’s coastlines as they were in 11,500 BC.Is it possible that what Reinal depicts are the remnants of these islands in theterminal stages of their post-glacial inundation?Three of the island groups he shows lie along India’s west coast, in the rightarea for such remnants, and one lies immediately next to the southern ‘fish-lip’(now less clear than at the LGM) at the very tip of the sub-continent.COASTING THE INDIAN OCEANThe Cantino and Reinal maps of the Indian Ocean were produced in an epoch ofintense competition for trade and a real hunger for geographical knowledge onthe part of the European powers that had witnessed – among many otherbreakthroughs – the rounding of South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope by BartolomeuDias in 1488,1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn1] the ‘discovery’ ofthe Americas by Columbus in 1492, and the Portuguese encounter with the Eastthat began when Vasco da Gama reached Calicut in south-west India in 1498.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn2]This first European crossing of the Indian Ocean was made from the East Africanport of Malindi (on the Swahili coast of modern Kenya) where da Gama and hissmall fleet arrived on 14 April 1498.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn3] There they were welcomed by thelocal chief, who arranged the services of ‘a loyal and extremely competentpilot’, Ahmed-bin-Majid, described as ‘the most famous expert in the navigationof the Indian Ocean in the 15th century’.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn4] With this man as their guide theyreached India very rapidly, anchoring in front of Calicut on the Malabar coaston 20 May 1498.5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn5]There the Portuguese remained for several months, attempting to put arrangementsin place to build a trading post, but were foiled at every step by establishedArab merchants alarmed at the prospect of European competition ruining theirbusiness with the East. Eventually da Gama left empty-handed, ‘convinced thatonly a stronger expedition … would have the power to bring negotiations to asuccessful conclusion’.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn6]On the return voyage there were outbreaks of scurvy, often as few as half adozen crew were well enough each day to man the ships, and the fleet wasalternately becalmed then driven off course by contrary winds. Their zigzagroute took them through the Lacadive archipelago – which da Gama named the SantaMaria islands – and then to the small island of Angediva, some 70 kilometressouth of Goa.7 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn7] Many died duringthe crossing to Malindi, which took three times as long as the outward passage,and it was the summer of 1499 before the survivors limped home to Portugal intheir two remaining ships.8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn8]Almost immediately after da Gama was welcomed back by King Manuel, thePortuguese monarch announced that a new, armed fleet would be sent to India –thirteen ships, with crew and soldiers totalling 1500 men, under the command ofPedro Alvares Cabral. Such a force, it was felt, would be sufficient to setaside the political and commercial obstacles that had confronted da Gama.9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn9]The new fleet set sail on 9 March, reaching the Canary islands five days laterand the Cape Verde islands on 22 March 1500. There one of the ships was ‘eatenby the sea’.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn10] The remainingtwelve crossed the Atlantic to South America where Cabral made landfall inBrazil on 26 April, claiming it for Portugal. Sending one ship back to Lisbonwith news of the discovery of the land that was first known as Vera Cruz, thenlater Santa Cruz, and finally Brazil,11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn11] he remained only until 2 May,then turned his fleet south-east and set a course for the Cape of Good Hope.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn12][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_111_r1.jpg]Voyages of Vasco da Gama and Pedro Alvares Cabral, AD 1498–1500.By this point Cabral’s fleet was reduced to eleven ships. Rounding the Cape ofGood Hope four more vessels went down with all hands in a violent tempest –among those who perished was Bartolomeu Dias, who thus ‘came to be buried in thewaters of which he had been the discoverer twelve years before’.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn13] A fifth ship, separated from thefleet in the same storm, discovered the island of Madagascar, and then returnedto Portugal on its own.14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn14]Cabral was therefore down to six ships and less than half his original forcewhen he crossed the Indian Ocean to Calicut. The opposition to a Portuguesetrading post still remained strong there and he was now no longer in a positionto overcome it. He therefore sailed further south along the Malabar coastlooking for a friendlier reception and found it at Cochin where the local rajahpermitted him to set up a ‘factory’. Cabral then took the fleet to Cananor wherethey loaded cargoes of spices before returning to Portugal in the early summerof 1501, just over a year after they had left.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn15]Although in both cases under extreme time pressure and in difficultcircumstances, the expeditions of da Gama and Cabral undoubtedly did conductsome cursory exploration of several hundred kilometres of the Malabar coastbetween roughly 15 degrees north latitude (Goa) and roughly 10 degrees northlatitude (Cochin). On the third and fourth expeditions, however, theseexplorations were not extended:16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn16] ‘It was only with the fifthIndia fleet in 1503 under Albuquerque that exploration was carried further, asfar as Coulon [Quilon], almost on the southern tip of Malabar.’17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn17]Cape Comorin – modern Kaniya Kumari, the true southern tip of the Indianpeninsula – was first rounded near the end of 1505 by a fleet under Lourenco deAlmeida. The fleet had been sent to the Maldives to spy on the sea trade withthe Indonesian islands further east but was carried off course to Cape Comorinby winds and currents. From there Almeida sailed his ships to Sri Lanka: ‘ThusLourenco de Almeida and his companions were the first Portuguese to pass intothe eastern Indian Ocean.’18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn18]In 1506 there was another ‘first’ – Joao Coelho was the first Portuguese toreach the northern terminus of the Bay of Bengal and ‘to drink the waters of theGanges’.19 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn19] But it was not until1509 that Diogo Lopes de Sequeira made the first full crossing of the Bay ofBengal to reach Malacca20 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn20] – theMalaysian peninsula known until that time on Ptolemaic maps as AureaChersonesus, the Golden Chersonese.21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn21]Thus, it can be seen that the focus of Portugal’s attention for more than adecade after Vasco da Gama first reached India in 1498 was on the Malabar coastsouth of Goa and on the eastern Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. The longlines of supply and relative scarcity of men and ships meant that no attentioncould be paid to the stretch of the Indian coast that runs north-westwards fromGoa, at roughly 15 degrees north latitude, past the Gulf of Cambay, theprominent Kathiawar peninsula and the mouths of the Indus, up to the northernterminus of the Arabian Sea at roughly 25 degrees north latitude. As DamiaoPeres writes in his authoritative History of the Portuguese Discoveries:In the first years of Portuguese expansion in the Indian Ocean, thereconnaissance of the Gulf of Arabia [i.e., the Arabian Sea] was limited to afew southern ports of the Malabar coast to the east, and to the coast of Arabiaand its neighbouring areas to the west. Included were some island groups lyingbetween the two. The northern part of the Gulf of Arabia [Arabian Sea] and itsadjacent waters – the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea – were only visited in thefirst years of the second decade of the sixteenth century.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn22]THE MYSTERY OF THE CANTINO MAP OF 1502And this brings us to what is mysterious about the Cantino map – so named afterAlberto Cantino, the Lisbon-based diplomatic agent of the powerful Duke ofFerrara in Italy.23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn23] Cantinosomehow acquired this beautiful but unsigned world map in Portugal, or had acartographer there copy it specially from another map, and then smuggled it outof the country, getting it to Italy by or before 19 November 150224[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn24] (no mean feat, since Portugalwas jealous of its discoveries and imposed the death penalty on those caughtsmuggling maps out of the country).25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn25][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_112_r1.jpg]India on the Cantino planisphere of c. AD 1502.When was the Cantino map drawn?Let us start by stating the obvious: it must have been drawn before 19 November1502, when it reached Italy. Indeed, according to H. Harisse, it typically tookcraftsmen of the period about ten months to prepare such a map. If this iscorrect, then it pushes the origins of the Cantino back at least to thebeginning of 1502.26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn26]Going back still further, there is internal evidence in the map itself whichproves that it could not have been drawn much before the summer of 1501. Thatwas when the ships of Cabral’s second India fleet returned to Portugal fromtheir voyage – begun a year previously – that had taken them not only to Indiabut also to South America. The evidence survives because the Cantino is a worldmap that shows – and claims with Portuguese flag-icons – the section of theBrazilian coast discovered by Cabral in 1500.27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn27] Since similar flag-icons arelikewise seen over Cochin and Cananor in southern India – which Cabral reachedlater in 1500 – it is the inescapable conclusion that the Cantino map expressesknowledge that could only have been acquired on the Cabral voyage.Indeed this is the conclusion of orthodox historians of cartography,28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn28] so it is not controversial torestate it here. What is extremely strange, however, is that neither on Cabral’svoyage of 1500/01, nor on the earlier 1498/9 voyage of Vasco da Gama, nor on anylater Portuguese voyage until after 1510, was the north-western part of Indiaever visited. Yet the Cantino map shows north-western India very clearly. Andalthough the portrayal is inaccurate vis-à-vis India’s western coast as it haslooked for the past 7000 years – in the single, significant respect that itentirely omits the Kathiawar peninsula – it is still hugely more accurate forIndia as a whole than the grotesque image of the subcontinent provided in thePtolemaic maps.Particularly noteworthy is Cantino’s representation of the east coast of India.In general (see diagrams) it matches well to what the east coast of India shouldlook like.I do not deny that the Portuguese were capable of drawing maps as accurate – andindeed more accurate – than this one. But the puzzle to me is how Cantino’sPortuguese cartographer could have acquired such accurate knowledge of theoutline of eastern India as early as 1501–2, when historical records show thatthe fleet of Lourenco de Almeida did not even round Cape Comorin and enter theeastern Indian Ocean until 1505? This part of the map also shows Sri Lanka atclose to its correct size and very close to its correct location more than threeyears before Lourenco de Almeida became the first Portuguese to sight Sri Lanka.Surely, therefore, curiosity should drive us to find an explanation for theexistence of this strikingly good chart of supposedly uncharted waters?‘T-O’ MAPSGood is a relative term. To understand why the Cantino and Reinal maps of theIndian Ocean are ‘good’, and in fact in some ways close to ‘revolutionary’, weneed to view them in the cartographic context of their place and time – i.e.Europe and the Mediterranean in the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries AD.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_113_r1.jpg]The Augsburg T-O map of AD 1472.During this period mariners, merchants, adventurers and armchair travellers hadat their disposal four distinctly different types of maps and charts. Thesimplest of all – far too simple to be of any use to navigators – are theso-called ‘T-O’ maps. With a long history going back to the seventh century AD,these show an encircling ‘O’ of water that is often inscribed with the words‘MARE OCEANUM’ -representing the ‘Ocean Sea’ (sometimes ‘Ocean River’) that wasbelieved in antiquity to surround all the lands of the world29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn29] (an idea, by the way, that iscompletely correct, as all the world’s oceans do indeed interconnect). Insidethe ‘O’ a ‘T’ is then inscribed, dividing up the land into the three knowncontinents of Africa, Asia and Europe. The vertical stroke of the T representsthe Mediterranean, separating Africa from Europe and adjoining the Ocean Sea atthe Atlantic. The cross-bar of the T is the north-flowing river Nile on one sideof the Mediterranean, the south-flowing river Don on the other side of theMediterranean and also, vaguely, the Black Sea, the Bosporus and easternMediterranean, beyond which lies the continent of Asia. The Garden of Eden isalso often depicted on the ‘top’ of such maps, which are oriented eastwards. Maphistorian John Goss points out that frequently ‘Four rivers were also describedas flowing from the Garden of Eden: Psihon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates.’30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn30]The T-O maps provide at best a ‘shorthand picture of the world’.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn31] But the enduring power andpervasiveness of this essentially useless cartographic tradition is illustratedby the oldest surviving printed map of Europe – a T-O map, printed by GuntherZainer at Augsburg in 1472, that reproduces exactly the original concept as setout by Isidore, Bishop of Seville, in his Etymologiarum written in the earlyseventh century.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn32]MAPPAMUNDIThe second category of maps and charts available between the fourteenth andsixteenth centuries is known as the mappamundi. It is important to be clear thatthis is a very distinct and specific type of world map (because, in the texts ofthose times, other world maps of completely different types were also sometimesreferred to as mappaemundi or mappamundi, when what was meant was just ‘worldmaps’ in the rather loose, general sense of ‘maps of the world’).33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn33] So, to be clear, the mappamundito which I refer here were normally hand-painted on cloth or vellum (hence theorigin of the name mappamundi — meaning, literally, ‘Cloth of the World’). Theclassic example is the Hereford mappamundi, attributed to Richard of HaldinghamC.AD 1290, but mappamundi continued to be made well into the fifteenth century.They retain the essential design of the T-O maps but greatly increase the amountof detail concerning mountains, rivers, pilgrim routes, etc., on the threerecognized continents of Africa, Asia and Europe – sometimes taking intoaccounts myths, legends and recent traveller’s tales. Unfortunately, none of thespecifically geographical details that these maps provide would have been of theslightest bit of use to travellers or mariners since all the details – all ofthem! – are wrong, misguided and misleading.34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn34] In short, the mappamundipromulgate a wholly incorrect image of the world – an image that is almost alldry land and that reduces the Ocean Sea covering seven-tenths of our planet tothe narrow, ribbon-like rim of the surrounding ‘O’. ‘The very crudeness of thegeography of the Hereford map’, comments John Goss, ‘reflects a markeddeterioration in geographical knowledge from the time of Ptolemy a thousandyears earlier.’35 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn35][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_114_r1.jpg]Hereford mappamundi, c.

Just how ancient this knowledge already was in thesecond century AD remains unclear. Scholars agree that its earliest survivingdocumented appearance is in the work of Pythagoras in the sixth century BC;44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn44] however, it may have longpre-dated Pythagoras in oral traditions or in documents that have since beendestroyed with the passage of time. My personal view, already expressedelsewhere, is that the concept of the spherical earth was well known to thefirst great historical civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians and theSumerians 5000 years ago and will ultimately be proved to date back to a muchmore remote period even than that. But wherever it comes from originally, we owea debt of gratitude to Ptolemy for its preservation and repromulgation in thesecond century AD – for, despite the intellectual ravages of the Dark Ages thatwere to follow, his vision of the earth as a sphere was never quite forgotten.Robert Fuson, Professor of Geography at the University of South Florida, puts itthis way:The Ocean Sea had now taken the form it was to retain until the 16th century andthe aftermath of Magellan’s circumnavigation. The earth’s sphericity was nolonger debated by any practical navigator, cosmographer, or educated person.This fact had been established since the days of Classical Greece. The onlyareas open to serious disagreement were details of coastal configuration, exactlocation by coordinates, island discovery and location, and the dimensions ofthe Ocean Sea. By the 1400s [before the discovery of the Americas] no reasonableperson questioned the proposition that Asia might be fetched by sailing westfrom Europe, if the ships and crews could survive the tremendous distance.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn45][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_115_r1.jpg]Francesco Berlinghieri’s Ptolemaic map, AD 1482.Other significant contributions that Ptolemy made to the scientific mapping ofthe world include the establishment of functional parallels of latitude, and ofa prime meridian, passing through the Canary islands, that was to serve as zerodegrees longitude for sixteen centuries.46[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn46] Moreover, though maps drawn toPtolemaic coordinates leave much to be desired, even the worst of them are farsuperior to the schematic ‘T-O’ maps and mappamundi of the Dark Ages.A representative selection of Ptolemaic world maps is reproduced herewith. Thereader will note that the Mediterranean is at least recognizable, and that inspite of many discrepancies a real attempt appears to have been made to reflectthe true shapes and locations of the lands bordering it. Ptolemy and hisinformants had first-hand, day-to-day knowledge of this central region of whatthey called the oikumene – the habitable world – and clearly, with some peculiarexceptions, they used that knowledge well. But outside the Mediterranean thelevel of accuracy rapidly falls away.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_116_r1.jpg]Ptolemaic map from Venice edition of Ptolemy’s Geography, AD 1511.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_117_r1.jpg]Waldseemuller’s Ptolemaic map, AD 1507.For example, on the authority of Poseidonius (135–50 BC),47[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn47] Ptolemy underestimates thecircumference of the earth at the equator, setting it at 20,400 miles (asagainst the correct figure of 24,902 miles).48[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn48] At the same time he greatlyoverestimates the east-west extent of Asia and, bizarrely, portrays the SouthAsian coast above the Indian Ocean apparently without any representationwhatsoever of the great peninsula of the Indian subcontinent. As though tocompensate for this loss, however, Ptolemy places an enormous island, Taprobana(presumed to be Sri Lanka), just off-shore of the stretch of non-peninsularmainland identified as India.What is going on here? In their major new study of Ptolemy’s Geography, J.Lennart Berggren and Alexander Jones suggest that the root of the problem issimple. India has this ‘flattened out’ appearance because Ptolemy, somehow, hasmanaged to turn the subcontinent on its side so that its orientation is roughlywest-to-east instead of north-to-south as it should be:Asia exhibits greater and greater distortions as one progresses further east,the most obvious faults being the north-south compression of the Indiansubcontinent so that its western coast is made to run parallel to the equator,and the exaggerated size of the island of Taprobana (Sri Lanka).49[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn49]If the subcontinent has indeed been swung eastwards in the way that Berggren andJones propose, then ‘Taprobana’ is not only too big to be Sri Lanka but is alsopositioned in entirely the wrong place. Sri Lanka lies in the Bay of Bengal, offIndia’s south-east coast. Once the reorientation of the peninsula on Ptolemy’smap is taken into account, however, then we can see that Taprobana has in factbeen portrayed as lying off India’s west coast – where there are no largeislands today.We will return to the possible implications of this later. Meanwhile, toconclude the description of Ptolemy’s world map, let us note that the olderexamples (e.g. page 466) portray the Indian Ocean as a lake landlocked by thenorthern edge of a southern continent (Terra Australis on some editions; TerraIncognita on others) that connects southern Africa with the south-easternextreme of Asia:At the eastern edge, where the lands represent central China and Southeast Asia,it is virtually impossible to identify any of the features on Ptolemy’s map withreal counterparts. At the eastern limit Ptolemy draws the coast of Asia turningsouth and then west, eventually to join the east coast of Africa, thereby makingthe Indian Ocean a vast enclosed sea unconnected with the Atlantic.50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn50]Ptolemy was not the originator of the Geography - as he himself goes to greatlengths to point out. Instead, he tells us that his role has been to refine andcorrect an earlier Geography prepared by his predecessor, the Phoeniciangeographer Marinus of Tyre, who was active around AD 100 or no and whose greatwork was itself called Correction of the World Map.51[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn51] In Ptolemy’s own words:Marinus of Tyre seems to have been the most recent of our students of geographia[= map-making] and to have applied himself to the subject with the greatestenthusiasm … If we could see that his latest composition lacked nothing, weshould even have been happy to complete our description of the known world fromthese notes of his alone, without researching any further. But as on certainpoints he himself seems to have composed without reliable comprehension, and asin embarking on his map he has in many places not devoted enough thought eitherto convenience or to symmetry, we were naturally induced to contribute to hiswork what seemed necessary to make it more logical and useful.52[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn52]As well as the honesty of this statement, what I find particularly striking isthe strong suggestion Ptolemy leaves us with that his Geography was part of atradition, and that his predecessor Marinus had been part of that tradition too– but by no means its first student, just the ‘most recent’ who had ‘corrected’an older map.53 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn53] Such a traditionmight, theoretically, have extremely ancient roots and it need not necessarilybe the case that successive ‘refinements’ of it over long periods of time musthave improved it. An alternative possibility, which it would be unwise to ignoreentirely, is that far from being the pinnacle or ‘culmination’ of ancientgeography, as many scholars suggest,54[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn54] Ptolemy’s maps may actually havebeen the end-products of a long process of decline, degradation and accumulatederrors introduced by many different hands into a far older and once far superiormap-making tradition. Again, this is a theme that we will return to.Some centuries after Ptolemy’s death the Dark Ages descended over the Geography,but it was still preserved here and there in a few monasteries in Europe.In the Arab world Muslim geographers are known to have possessed editions of theGeography as early as the eighth century AD, as well as separate editions of theearlier work of Marinus (the latter now all being lost):In the early ninth century al Ma’amun, Caliph of Baghdad AD 813–833, set up anAcademy of Science, which among other things produced a world map [lost] and‘improved tables’, – i.e. modernized coordinates.55[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn55]In Byzantium (Constantinople) in the late thirteenth century it was MaximusPlanudes (c.1260–1310) who was responsible for bringing the knowledge enshrinedin Ptolemy back to the attention of the world:He searched for manuscripts of Ptolemy’s Geography, and his search was rewardedin 1295, but it was not as exciting as he had hoped. As he explains in a letterand some verses, after at last finding what he knew was a neglected work, he wasdisappointed to discover that it had no maps.56[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn56]Although there are older manuscript maps (such as the late twelfth-or earlythirteenth-century Codex Urbanus Graecus 82), the oldest surviving manuscriptcopy of the Geography containing maps based on the descriptions and coordinatesgiven by Ptolemy was made by monks at Vatopedi on Mount Athos in the earlyfourteenth century.57 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn57] It laterformed the basis for the first printed atlas to appear in Europe, published atBologna, Italy, in 1477.58 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn58]The Ptolemaic cartographic tradition was at first very successful in adapting tothe challenges posed to its world-view by the Age of Discovery. Thus, theoriginal maps based on Ptolemy’s own coordinates were added to several timesduring the sixteenth century to accommodate so-called tabulae novae (or tabulaemodernae) recording the expanding revelation of the Americas and of the East.59[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn59] This could be done withoutcausing serious disturbance to the Ptolemaic concept of the oikumene so long asthe simple expedient could be maintained of tagging the Americas on to Asia likesome vast peninsula. Ultimately, however, these maps, like the dinosaurs, werean evolutionary dead-end doomed to extinction.It would be wrong to imagine from all this that the few surviving Ptolemaic mapsin libraries and archives around the world have nothing to teach us. They mayappear distorted and clumsy to the sophisticated modern eye, but it is possiblethat their very awkwardness and peculiarity could have caused scholars tooverlook significant details concealed within them.PORTOLAN CHARTSThe fourth category of maps circulating in Europe from the fourteenth to thesixteenth centuries, known collectively as portolanos, portolan charts or simplyportolans, shows no dependence whatsoever on either Ptolemaic maps or data orthe mappamundi. The vast majority of the portolans depict only theMediterranean/Black Sea area and the countries immediately round about, but someare world maps, or world atlases, for which the style and approach of theMediterranean portolans serves as a basis. These old charts are drawn to thehighest cartographical standards and are uncannily accurate – so accurate,though the earliest examples go back to the end of the thirteenth century, thatthey were not surpassed by new scientific techniques, measurements andobservations for almost 500 years.60[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn60]A. E. Nordenskiold, the great Swedish polar explorer and map historian, had aspecial interest in portolans. He points out that they were used, almostentirely, by practical mariners and navigators:Slight was the attention paid to them in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuriesby learned geographers. Thus Munster seems to have totally overlooked them, andin the first edition of the Theatrum Orbis Terr arum, Ortelius does not mentiona single drawer of portolanos amongst the cartographical authors enumerated inhis Catalogus Auctorum. At present the investigator into the history ofgeography acknowledges them as unsurpassed masterpieces, and reckons themamongst the most important contributions to cartography during the MiddleAges.61 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn61]Likewise John Goss notes:The portolan charts were quite unlike contemporary medieval maps. They oftenincorporated detail of remarkable accuracy, based on close and actualobservation, rather than the conventional medieval habit of repeatingcartographical and mythical information issued by the Church.62[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn62]Goss and Nordenskiold also point to other characteristics that make theportolans look and ‘feel’ different: * A network of intersecting straight lines (usually called ‘rhumb-lines’ or ‘loxodromic lines’)63 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn63] originating from sixteen equidistant points, spread about the circumference of a ‘hidden circle’ around the map. * An elaborate ‘compass-rose’ at one or more of the points of intersection of the lines. * Place and feature names written perpendicular to the coastline, in sequence along the coast. * Charts drawn in ink on vellum or parchment with colour conventions, e.g., most important names shown in red, rest in black; lines depicting four main wind directions drawn in black, the eight half winds in green, the sixteen quarter winds in red. * Coastlines emphasize bays and headlands; hazards such as rocks, reefs and shoals are marked with dots or small crosses.64 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn64]What all these characteristics have in common is their utility and significanceto mariners. The coastal hazards are matters of life and death. The networks ofrhumb-lines assist compass navigation. Even the perpendicular place names,inevitably upside-down from some angles, make sense when you realize that theyare meant to be viewed in the same direction as that of a vessel following thecoast.It has been suggested that portolans are such an improvement on previous mapsbecause they reflect the earliest introduction of the compass into Europe,thought to have taken place around the end of the thirteenth century65[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn65] (although the use of magnetizedneedles as a means for sailors to find their bearings is attested earlier thanthat).66 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn66] But while there is nodoubt that such charts in conjunction with compasses do provide very effectivenavigational guides, it is by no means so certain that compasses andcompass-bearings were used to prepare them in the first place. On the contrary,says A. E. Nordenskiold, ‘many of them are evidently older than the use of thecompass on board ships’.67 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn67]No map projection is imposed on the portolans, and there is no latitude andlongitude grid – although in the expanded ‘world portolans’ the equator is oftenshown, together with the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and the Arctic andAntarctic Circles. Nevertheless, when relative latitudes and longitudes on thesemaps are measured, they prove to be extremely accurate. For example, on theDulcert portolan of AD 1339 the total longitude of the Mediterranean and theBlack Seas is correct to within half a degree.68[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn68][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_118_r1.jpg]Carta Pisan portolan, c. AD 1290.It is wrong to argue, as I myself have done in the past,69[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn69] that mariners and chartmakers ofthe fourteenth century would have found it impossible to achieve such accuratelongitudes. Such suspicions arise from the fact that marine chronometers – whichmade reliable calculations of longitude at sea possible – were not introduceduntil the second half of the eighteenth century. However, scholars are right toobject that there are other, simpler (if vastly more time-consuming) ways toobtain almost equally accurate longitudes. As Gregory Mcintosh put it in ane-mail:We moderns seem to tend to think that because we now have methods of making veryaccurate measurements very quickly, those in the past could not make anymeasurements at all. The Portuguese (and others, of course) made dead reckoningmeasurements of longitude [i.e. calculations based on empirical estimates ofcourse, speed and time]. It is a method of measurement. Some writers of theHapgood ilk [Charles Hapgood, Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings] would have usbelieve that dead reckoning is not a valid method of measurement. They wouldhave us believe that the Portuguese did not measure longitude. But of coursethey did. That’s what dead reckoning is – a method of measuring longitude … withseveral such measurements from repeated voyages.70[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn70][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_119_r1.jpg]Top: Dulcert portolan, AD 1339. Bottom: Maggiolo portolan, AD 1563.This seems like an entirely reasonable explanation for the accuracy of theportolan charts – that they are the result of the accumulated observations andmeasurements of navigators plying the coasts of the Mediterranean overrelatively long periods of time. Some have suggested that they may even tracetheir origins back to the detailed written accounts of sea-journeys, harbourconditions, winds, currents and trade – the periploi – that were in favouramongst the ancient Greeks as far back as the fifth century BC.Still, there is a very large gulf indeed between the crude directions of theperiploi and the navigational accuracy of the portolan maps. Along anyhypothetical evolutionary road from one to another it is reasonable to expect tosee intermediate forms – since getting maps right by dead reckoning, as Mcintoshpoints out, is a painstaking, long-term process of trial and error, correctionand gradual improvement.And this is the central problem of the portolans. Quite simply, there are nointermediate forms. Indeed, remarks John Goss:From the outset portolan charts appear to have been remarkably accurate withlittle evolutionary development from the earliest known examples to the latercharts made towards the end of the seventeenth century.71[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn71]And A. E. Nordenskiold, the world’s greatest authority on the portolans, remindsresearchers that:Notwithstanding all the progress made during the fifteenth and sixteenthcenturies in the art of drawing maps with the aid of newly invented nauticalinstruments, there was published a chart in Holland in 1595 by one of its mostexpert mariners which is only a copy, or rather a copy of copies, of portolanosdrawn 250 to 300 years earlier. This is an extremely remarkable fact in thehistory of civilization. But moreover the principal features of the portolanosfrom the beginning of the fourteenth century are still to be found on VanKeulen’s sea-charts of 1681–1722. I suppose that up to the beginning of thenineteenth century the influence of the old portolan charts may yet be traced onthe charts of several parts of the Mediterranean and Black Seas.72[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn72]THE GOOD LEGACYThe ‘extremely remarkable fact in the history of civilization’ that Nordenskiolddraws our attention to here is the ability of maps, apparently produced by deadreckoning in the thirteenth century, to compete on an equal footing withscientific nautical charts from as late as the nineteenth century.And it is remarkable. Because, yes, we can accept with Mcintosh that it waswithin the competence of navigators of the thirteenth century to have producedthe excellent portolan outline of the Mediterranean that was to require solittle improvement over the next 500 years – in other words, we can accept thatit could have been done. We can even accept that it might have been done. But itis much harder to agree that this is what actually was done, since neitherMcintosh nor any other scholar favouring the gradual ‘evolutionary’ explanationfor the very early perfection of the portolan genre has yet been able to provideus with even a single example of charts that illustrate even a single aspect ofthis proposed ‘gradual evolution’.In my opinion, therefore, Peter Whitfield is right to evaluate the Carta Pisane,the oldest surviving portolan in the world, as ‘one of the most enigmatic chartsin the history of mapmaking’.73 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn73]In his 1996 study, Charting of the Oceans, he elaborates on this theme:The appearance of this chart (and of the others which survive from the followingcentury) is one of the most mysterious events in the history of mapmaking. Aglance at the Pisan Chart immediately reveals two outstanding features: thecoastlines of the Mediterranean are drawn with striking accuracy; and the map iscovered with a network of lines radiating from two central points, which clearlyimpose the form of the compass over the whole map. How did this highly accuratemap suddenly appear in medieval Italy, and how exactly was it linked to thecompass? Was it the original work of a single individual, or was it descendedfrom a line of much older charts which had been developing for centuries? Theformer is difficult to believe, but the latter cannot explain why there is noshred of evidence for the existence of such maps before 1270.74[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn74]Whitfield outlines the orthodox scholarly response that the evolution of theportolans must have taken place within the oral lore of mariners and within thetextual tradition – going back to the Greek periploi – of books of sailingdirections:One famous example entitled Lo Compasso da Navigare was current among Italianmariners and it would be tempting to suppose that the contents of a text such asthis had been transformed with the aid of compass bearings into the Pisan Chart.Unfortunately, the places named in Lo Compasso differ sharply from those namedon the map, even the names in Italy itself. Moreover, the transition from a listof names and bearings to an accurate map is an enormous one, requiring not onlya high degree of geometric and drafting skill, but also an imaginative leap tocreate a graphic form for which there was no parallel. Even if the Pisan chartwas based on some now-lost portolano, we have no real idea how it was done. Norcan we really answer the most fundamental question of all about the chart – howwas it used? We have no independent description of its use, although we do know,from examination of the chart itself, that the compass lines were plotted beforethe map itself was drawn …75 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn75]Concerning how it was done, Whitfield notes:Later practice was to make a running survey, in which coastal features – capes,bays or islands – were sighted from two, three or four positions as the shipsailed by. Starting from the ship’s course, the distances run and the angles ofsight were used to build up a profile of the coast. This method was in use bythe later sixteenth century, but we can only conjecture whether it was known atthe time the Pisan Chart was drawn. If it was not, it is extremely difficult toaccount for the accuracy of some of the coastlines, which would scarcely beimproved on this scale until the eighteenth century.76[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn76]But even if we admit that running-survey and compass techniques were somehowbeing used on ships to produce sea-charts as early as the thirteenth century(which most historians of science would rule out) we still come against theunexplained enigma of the miraculous and fully formed de novo appearance of theCarta Pisane. As we’ve seen, not a single chart pre-dates it that demonstratesin any way the gradual build-up of coastal profiles across the whole extent ofthe Mediterranean that must have occurred before a likeness as perfect as thiscould have been resolved.It is possible, of course, through the vicissitudes of history, that all theevidence for the prior evolution of portolans before the Carta Pisane has simplybeen lost. If that were the case, however – in other words if the Carta Pisaneis a snapshot of a certain moment in the development of an evolving genre ofmaps, and if we accept that all earlier ‘snap-shots’ have been lost, wouldn’t wenevertheless expect that such an ‘evolving genre’ would have continued to evolveafter the date of the earliest surviving example?Whether we set the date of the Pisane between 1270 and 1290 (as Whitfieldsuggests)77 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn77] or a little later –between 1295 and 1300 – as other scholars have argued, we’ve seen that thatthere was no significant evolution afterwards.78[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn78]Now kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the enigmatic Pisane is anunsigned chart and scholars have no idea who the cartographer might have been.79[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn79]Next comes what Whitfield rightly describes as the ‘startling and precocious’work of the earliest chartmakers known to us by name in the first half of thefourteenth century. These include Vesconte and Pizzagano in Venice, and Dulcertand Valseca in Majorca. None of them seems to have copied the Carta Pisanedirectly, but neither do they add significant cartographical detail in thecentral Mediterranean/Black Sea area covered by the Pisane. On the contrary,what we see in their more lavish maps are only the effects of very minortinkering and stylistic improvements. The basic template inherited from thethirteenth century remains unaltered and stays that way for the rest of the lifeof the genre.So the hypothesis of a gradual evolution of portolan charts out of books ofsailing directions does not withstand close scrutiny. Convinced of this, A. E.Nordenskiold sought a more satisfactory explanation and came, after many yearsof study, to a radical conclusion – that the original model for all the portolancharts, a hypothetical common ancestor that he refers to as the ‘normalportolano’ is most likely to have been derived from the long lost sea-charts ofthe Phoenician geographer Marinus of Tyre.80[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn80]In other words, the Carta Pisane and the other early portolan charts thatstarted the genre were not a ‘development’ of anything. They were a legacy.THE SEA-FISH OF TYRENordenskiold points out that the same legends and place names, presented in thesame way, appear on all portolan charts. He makes a special illustration of thiswith reference to the Catalan Atlas of the fourteenth century, Giroldis’portolan of the fifteenth century, and one by Volontius of the end of thesixteenth century, but argues that it is true for all portolans:When to this is added(1) that the Mediterranean and the Black Sea have exactly the same shape on allthese maps; (2) that a distance scale with the same unit of length … occurs onall these maps, independently of the land of their origin; (3) that thedistances across the Mediterranean and the Black Sea measured with this scaleagree perfectly on different maps; (4) that the conventional shape given to anumber of smaller islands and capes included in the maps remained almostunaltered on portolanos from the 14th century to the end of the 16th; then itmay be held as completely proved that all these portolanos are only slightlyaltered and emended ‘codices’ of the same original which I designate by the namenormal portolano.81 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn81]In his quest ‘to determine when and where the normal portolano was composed’,82[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn82] Nordenskiold uncovered apreviously overlooked passage in a work written in AD 955 by the important Arabgeographer Masudi who states that he had: ‘seen the maps of Marinus, and thatthese by far surpassed those of Ptolemy’.83[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn83]The portolans are the only maps drawn in ancient times or in the Middle Agesthat are better than the maps of Ptolemy.84[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn84] We cannot say for sure howancient their origins are. But they must have a background somewhere. It isNordenskiold’s hypothesis that ‘the first origin of the portolanos is to bederived from the Tyrian charts described by Ptolemy under the name of Marinus’85[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn85] and that the world map ofMarinus could have been ‘a real portolano, provided with a text’.86[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn86] Moreover,If Ptolemy himself had not always spoken of Marinus as a definite personality,it could have been conjectured that the name Marinus of Tyre, or the Tyriansea-fish, had only been a collective name for a certain category of nauticalmaps … The numerous editions mentioned by Ptolemy mean that the Tyrian chartswere made for a practical purpose, and the improvements, introduced according toPtolemy in every new edition, constituted the germ of the future masterpiece …87[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn87]This is an interesting speculation, for indeed there is no mention of Marinusoutside of Ptolemy which independently confirms the Phoenician geographer’sexistence. Nor is it too much to ask of the facts to suggest that the famousseafaring city of Tyre to which Marinus supposedly belonged might haveoriginated a special category of charts that came to be known, colloquially, bya name something like the ‘Tyrian sea-fish’. Perhaps, despite thepersonalization, it was an atlas of ‘Tyrian sea-fish’ regional charts and a‘Tyrian sea-fish’ world map that Ptolemy ‘corrected’ and ‘improved’ in thesecond century AD, and not the work of any individual geographer?And I’ve already noted that we only have Ptolemy’s word for it that he actuallydid improve on Marinus. Maybe he thought he was doing that – while all the timehis ‘improvements’ were only making the Phoenician charts worse. That wouldexplain why Arab mariners of the tenth century still treasured the originalMarinus maps that they had somehow managed to preserve and declared them to beso much better than the Ptolemaic ones.ARABIA WITHOUT MAPSJust three Arab portolans, all classic ‘normal portolanos’ of the Mediterraneanand Black Sea area, have ever been found. The earliest dates from 1300, veryclose to the date of the Carta Pisane, and the other two from 1413 and 1461respectively.88 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn88] This suggests atleast two things to me: first, like the Europeans, the Arabs made no attempt todevelop the inherited normal portolano (other than putting modern names andlegends on their copies of it); secondly, although the Marinus ‘normalportolano’ had been preserved by the Arabs, as Masudi testifies, and althoughthere was clearly some demand for it, the survival of only three Arab copiessuggests that its use never became anything like as widespread in Arab seafaringas it did in the seafaring of the Europeans.In his discussion of Arab cartography, A. E. Nordenskiold has this to say:Various admirable descriptions of distant lands and of extensive voyages writtenby Arabian scholars and far surpassing the geographical productions of the sameperiod among the Christians, are still extant. But similar perfection was neverattained by the Arabian maps, which, if they were original drawings and not, asthe planisphere of Idrisi, mere copies or reproductions from Ptolemy, are notonly far inferior to the maps of the Alexandrian geographer, but not evencomparable to the Esquimau-sketches brought home by English and Danish polartravellers from the icy deserts of the polar regions.89[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn89]This may seem an over-harsh judgement, since there is no doubt that the Arabswere brave and adventurous explorers. For example, the same Idrisi mentioned inthe passage above also indicates that in the tenth century Arab sailors crossedor attempted to cross the Atlantic.90[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn90] But it is true that Idrisi,geographer to King Roger II of Sicily at the end of the twelfth century, didbase his beautiful maps on Ptolemy.91[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn91] And it is true, with theexception of the three rare Arab portolans that have survived (one of them beingnotably early), that the quality of the rest of Arab cartography in this periodwas not high.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_120_r1.jpg]Al-Tunisi Arabic portolan, western section, AD 1413.Regardless of whether the Arabs themselves were good or bad at making maps,however, as Nordenskiold points out:It is shown by the passage referred to in Masudi, that the maps of Marinus ofTyre were still extant in the middle of the 10th century, that is to say,shortly before the time when the first portolan maps were drawn. Since that timethey have completely disappeared. It might be legitimately concluded from thisthat the portolanos may have arisen as a modernization of the Tyrian sea-fishundertaken during the Crusades, and that they stood in the same relation to themaps of Marinus as the tabulae modernae in the printed editions of the Geographyof Ptolemy stood to the Alexandrine geographer’s own work.92[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn92]ON MARVELLOUS THINGSBy documenting the presence among the Arabs at so late a date of good ancientmaps that were (a) attributed to Marinus of Tyre and (b) recognized as belongingto a distinct tradition superior to Ptolemy, Nordenskiold provides at least thebeginnings of a plausible answer to the riddle of the ‘lost evolution’ of theportolans prior to the Carta Pisane. Here is the scenario in brief: ‘sea-fish’maps, unadulterated by Ptolemy, that had been carried to perfection by thesecond century AD were preserved by Arab culture until the thirteenth centuryAD. Then at least part of the legacy – a chart of the Mediterranean and BlackSea region, Nordenskiold’s ‘normal portolano’ – fell into European hands,providing the model, with the necessary modernization of place names, etc., forthe Carta Pisane and the entire portolan genre.In my opinion this is a more rational and more parsimonious way to account forthe highly developed state of the normal portolano than to ask us, as mosthistorians do, to accept that such striking and precocious cartography somehow‘evolved’ out of books of sailing directions. And Nordenskiold’s hypothesis,though it leaves unanswered all questions about the roots and antiquity of theMarinus tradition before the second century AD, is also on sound logical groundby reminding us of the role of the Phoenicians in all this.Known to have circumnavigated Africa by 595 BC,93[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn93] 2000 years before thePortuguese, the Phoenicians maintained fleets throughout the Red Sea, the IndianOcean and the Mediterranean (at powerful naval and mercantile cities like Tyre,Sidon and Carthage), planted major colonies on the Atlantic coasts of Europe andNorth Africa, and crossed the Atlantic at least as far as the Azores and theCanary Islands.94 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn94] They were,without contest, the greatest mariners of the ancient world. Indeed, between thetime of Ptolemy and the time of the Portuguese one looks in vain for any otherseafaring culture of the Mediterranean/Black Sea region that would have had boththe capacity and the inclination to devise a map like the normal portolano.Moreover, if the normal portolano is indeed derived from the lost atlas ofMarinus of Tyre, then it follows that other high-quality maps of regions muchfurther afield than the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, and indeed a world map,might also have been preserved by the Arabs – for we know from Ptolemy’stestimony that other Marinus maps, including a world map, did once exist. Itwill therefore do no harm to keep an open mind to the possibility that theportolan world maps that began to appear during the century after the CartaPisane,95 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn95] might also have beeninfluenced by earlier ‘Tyrian sea-fish’ maps of Phoenician origin. ChristopherColumbus, whose passionate belief in lands across the Atlantic led to his‘discovery’ of the New World, seems to hint at a Phoenician connection when hedescribes one of the inspirations for his journey:Aristotle in his book On Marvellous Things reports a story that someCarthaginian merchants sailed over the Ocean Sea to a very fertile island … thisisland some Portuguese showed me on their charts under the name Antilia.96[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn96]Antilia first appears on a portolan chart of 1424. It is a mysterious presencethere, a riddle, to which we will return.WHAT GUZARATE SHOWED DA GAMAThe suggestion has been made that ‘world’ portolans – indeed, any that showregions outside the normal portolano area – could have been based on the lostworld map of Marinus. And if the normal portolano reached Europe after beingpreserved among the Arabs for many centuries, it could be the case that theArabs preserved the world map too. We’ve seen that some Arab portolans of theMediterranean/Black Sea area do exist – although they are very few in number. Soit makes sense to look for traces among the Arabs of a portolan world map aswell.Nordenskiold believed he had identified such a trace. Combing throughgeographical works from the Age of Discovery, he found a passage in J. DeBarros’ Asia (first Portuguese edition printed 1552) which states that the Arabsin the Indian Ocean possessed sailing charts with degree-lines, ‘perhapscomparable in their finish to the portolanos’:97[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn97]When Vasco da Gama during his first voyage, in April 1498, arrived at Malindi onthe east coast of Africa, he there procured a pilot named Guzarate to sail hisship to India. Da Gama was much pleased with him, especially since the pilotshowed him a map made in the Arabian (Moorish) manner of the whole Indian coast,without compass lines but divided by meridians and parallels into small squares.The pilot also showed him some nautical instruments intended for determininglatitude, different to those which da Gama had brought with him.98[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn98]There are a number of points of great interest in this report: * The name that De Barros gives for the pilot is quite different from the name of ‘Ahmed-bin-Majid’ provided by other sources. In fact, Guzarate doesn’t sound much like a name at all. What it does sound like is a nickname or familiar term – ‘Gujerati’ – that may still be heard on Kenya’s Swahili coast today in reference to natives of the Indian state of Gujerat. Is it possible that da Gama’s ‘Arab pilot’ was in fact an Indian pilot – a Gujerati? * The map is said to show the ‘whole Indian coast’. * The map is said to be ‘without compass lines’ – which takes it far from the standard European presentation of a portolan. * The map is said to possess meridians and parallels – again far from the normal portolano, which has no meridians and parallels. However, these meridians and parallels are also said to divide Guzarate’s map into ‘small squares’. It is of note in this respect, though they do not result from intersecting meridians and parallels, that the Carta Pisane has four areas divided up into small squares and two other areas divided into slightly larger squares. Such divisions occur on no other portolan chart known in the west.99 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn99] * The pilot is said to have used unfamiliar nautical instruments, presumably in conjuction with the map.We’ve already seen that neither on da Gama’s 1498/9 voyage, nor on Cabral’s of1500/01 – and indeed not until after 1510 – did the Portuguese have theopportunity to chart the north-west coast of India between Goa and the Indusdelta. The evidence of this is in the record of the voyages and also, obliquely,in the Cantino map of 1502, which draws on the latest knowledge that thePortuguese had acquired along the way. Ironically, the very absence of anaccurate portrayal of the Kathiawar peninsula in the Cantino map, an absencethat still persisted in 1510 when the Reinal map of the Indian Ocean was drawn,provides further convincing evidence that the Portuguese did not chartnorth-west India until after 1510 – because if they had they would have done amuch better job of it (at least as good a job as they did on the coasts ofBrazil also discovered on the 1500/01 voyage). They would certainly not haveoverlooked such a prominent feature as the Kathiawar Peninsula of Gujerat withits two great gulfs of Kutch and Cambay (the latter offering particularly richtrade potential). If we accept in addition that a Gujerati pilot of some reputeseems to have been known to the Portuguese, it becomes all the more incredibleto imagine that the most precise navigators and mapmakers of the fourteenth andfifteenth centuries could have charted the coast of their pilot’s home regionand failed to make an accurate representation of it.In short, everything suggests that the Portuguese were not there, and did notchart those coasts until after 1510, and that the representation of north-westIndia which appears in the Cantino and Reinal maps must therefore have beenborrowed by them from a pre-existing local map.What better candidate for such a map than the very one that Guzarate showed daGama and that da Gama so admired on his first crossing to Calicut in 1498?QUICK DETOUR TO OCEANIAOne of the several intriguing possibilities suggested by the Guzerate story isthat a tradition of accurate map-making with its roots lost in prehistory-perhaps the same tradition that also nourished Marinus of Tyre in theMediterranean and that eventually expressed itself in the medieval portolans –survived amongst both Arab and Indian navigators in the Indian Ocean right upuntil the time of the European voyages of discovery.The quality of the maps derived from the Indian Ocean tradition was recognizedin the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries by the great Portuguese mariners likeda Gama (and others as we shall see in later chapters). But there is evidencethat these maps and the navigational system that lay behind them had alsoinfluenced other cultures in much earlier epochs. I note in passing that in hisdetailed study of the astonishing achievements of Micronesian and Polynesiannavigators in their discovery of the Pacific between approximately 2000 BC and1000 AD Dr David Lewis draws attention to ‘some remarkable similarities betweenwhat has been recorded of ancient Indian Ocean systems of non-instrumentalnavigation, unquestionably the older, and their Pacific counterparts’.100[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn100]Lewis points out that ‘the magnetic compass … was preceded in the Indian Oceanby a star compass … a compass-card marked in star points’.101[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn101] Strangely, the archaic IndianOcean star compass proves to be very similar to star-compasses of the farPacific:No fewer than eighteen of the thirty-two star points appear to be identical inthe Indian Ocean and the Pacific systems …102[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn102] [There is] every reason tobelieve that what we term ‘Polynesian-Micronesian’ navigation was merely part ofa system once practised through all the Asian seas, and which very probably didnot even originate in Oceania at all.103[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn103]ICE AGE INDIA?We will encounter other traces of the same lost system when we reach China andJapan in later chapters. But our concern for the moment remains with its impacton European maps of India produced in the early days of the age of discovery.We’ve seen that the Cantino and the Reinal maps (1502 and 1510 respectively)were drawn before the Portuguese exploration of India’s coastlines was completeand that a likely explanation for this that is that both were copied from apre-existing local source map – perhaps the very map that Guzarate showed daGama.Having a shared common source, or deriving from different but closely similarsources, provides a simple explanation for why the Cantino and Reinal maps areso much alike in almost all respects and also, crucially, why both containsimilar mistakes. As I was already aware from Sharif Sakr’s first report (seechapter 14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14]) these mistakes include theabsence of the Kathiawar peninsula with its characteristic Gulfs of Kutch andCambay; a distinct bulge in the north-west corner of India; enlargement of manysmall island groups, and a south-westerly orientation (with what Sharifdescribes as ‘distinct lips’) of the southern tip of India. In his e-mail of 23February 2001 he then makes the crucial observation that:While these deviations are all errors relative to a modern map of India, they infact match up extremely well with Glenn Milne’s map of India 21,300 years ago atLGM. This inundation map shows a large indent at the mouth of the Indus, a bulgeobscuring completely the Kathiawar peninsula, enlarged Lakshadweep and Maldivesislands, and, most surprisingly, a SW-pointing ‘mouth’ shape at India’s southerntip that is virtually identical to that shown by Reinal.104[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn104]It seems to me that these correlations, and the others that Sharif reported on10 August 2001, are obvious, striking and speak for themselves. The onlyquestions that need to be asked about them are: (1) do they result from theworkings of coincidence? Or (2) are they there because the source maps forCantino and Reinal were originally drawn at the end of the Ice Age – perhaps notas far back as the LGM but certainly before the final inundation of the Gulfs ofKutch and Cambay which created the Kathiawar peninsula around 7700 years ago?105[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn105]We already know, and nobody would dispute, that the maps of Claudius Ptolemyhave now survived in human culture for almost 2000 years and that theyincorporate far older streams of ideas, some certainly going back as far as thesixth century BC and some probably much further.In the light of Masudi’s testimony confirming the late survival amongst theArabs of the maps of Marinus, it by no means seems far-fetched to suggest, withNordenskiold, that the Marinus ‘branch’ of cartography was never ‘lost’ at allbut simply transformed itself into the portolan tradition. Otherwise we have theparadox of ‘the most perfect cartographic work of the Middle Ages’106[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c21-ftn106] appearing suddenly, fromnowhere, with no prior evolution. And since we already accept that Ptolemyincorporated ideas much earlier than his own in the making of his maps, whyshouldn’t we accept that Marinus did so too?The Reinal and Cantino maps are portolans that extend far beyond the normalportolano area of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. And while they doincorporate a few Ptolemaic ideas about the shape of the world, both maps aremore distinguished by their stark differences from – and superiority to –Ptolemy. How much of this is due to Marinus? And how old might the oldestinformation be that could have been included in the Marinus maps? Could some ofit have been as old as the last Ice Age when India did actually look the way itis portrayed by Cantino and Reinal?If there is any possibility that the latter scenario is correct, then it wouldbecome interesting to work out what precise period during the 10,000-yearpost-glacial meltdown between 17,000 and 7000 years ago is portrayed by theIndian coastlines on the Cantino and Reinal maps.FINAL REPORT ON REINALSharif Sakr to Graham Hancock15 August 2001It seems that every time I go back to comparing the Reinal map of 1510 and theMilne map for 11,500 BC, I find that the correlation is even better than Ipreviously thought. My latest revision highlights the great affinity between thelatitudinal positions of the ‘erroneous’ features on Reinal’s non-PtolemaicIndian coastline and the correlating features on Milne’s inundation map.Milne’s map, in harmony with bathymetric maps of India’s outer shelf, clearlyshows a large gulf at the latitude of today’s Indus river delta. I call thisfeature the ‘Indus Gulf, simply because before the postglacial period the Indusriver may have emptied here. In my first e-mail I correlated the ‘Indus Gulfwith the only gulf shown on Hapgood’s tracing of Reinal’s map in roughly theright place. This correlation is not perfect: the portolan gulf is the wrongshape and it lies too far north (because Reinal’s Tropic of Cancer is too farnorth, continuing a Ptolemaic error). Moreover, this northern gulf on the Reinalmight be better matched with Sonmiani Bay (and the mouth of the Porali river),which lies to the north of the Indus and which was well known to Arabgeographers of the time because of the important seaport of Daibul. Thisnorthern part of the map is so inaccurate that it is difficult to be sure ofanything.But the Bodleian photograph reveals another large gulf on the Reinal, not shownproperly in Hapgood’s tracing, which exactly matches the Indus Gulf on Milne’smap in terms of shape, size and latitude. This gulf lies south of Reinal’serroneous Tropic of Cancer, and at exactly the right latitude relative to, forexample, the eastern tip of Oman on the opposite side of the Indian Ocean. Itlies well outside the area covered by the old Ptolemaic model and is thereforevery likely to have been present on the mysterious non-Ptolemaic source thatReinal used.When we correlate the gulf shown in Milne’s map with this gulf on the Reinalmap, the latitudinal positions of Reinal’s other ‘errors’, relative to eachother and to this northern landmark, make far more sense. Overleaf is my finalmatching of ‘errors’ on the Reinal map to features on the Milne map – justfollow the numbers:[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_121_r1.jpg]India’s coastlines in Reinal map of AD 1510. 1.

An island (or island-group) which is depicted on both maps but which does not exist today. 4. A gulf which on both maps is much smaller than the Gulf of Cambay that exists today. 5. A large island (or island-group) which is depicted on both maps but which does not exist today. 6.

A tiny island which is depicted on both Reinal’s and Milne’s maps next to the southern tip of the sub-continent. No island exists there today. 10.

He left Venice in AD 1271, travelled to theEast via the Black Sea, Persia, Afghanistan and the Pamirs, spent seventeenyears in China and seven on the road and at sea, and returned to Venice in 1295.Later he composed a book, Il milione (‘The Million’), known in English as theTravels of Marco Polo, which was to become a geographical classic.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn1]Polo’s account of his outbound journey – almost entirely overland – and of hislong residence in China, contains little of relevance to the mysteries we areexploring in Underworld. His return journey, however, begun around 1292, is ofmuch greater interest to us here. It includes the first-ever notice by aEuropean of the existence of Japan – which Polo called Cipango (or ‘Zipangu’)from the Chinese Jih-Pen2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn2] – andit describes the epic sea voyage that he undertook on his way home, beginning atthe eastern Chinese port of Ch’uan-chou (modern Quanzhou, opposite the island ofTaiwan), sailing south around Vietnam and Cambodia, across the Gulf of Thailand,around the Malay peninsula, through the narrow Strait of Malacca that separatesthe peninsula from Sumatra, thence across the Bay of Bengal to Sri Lanka, aroundCape Comorin, north along the west coast of India to the Gulf of Cambay, andfinally across the Arabian Sea to Hormuz at the entrance to the Persian Gulf.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn3] Thus it was that Marco Polo madefamiliar to Europeans the names and descriptions of many places that would notbe heard of again until the Portuguese exploration of India and the Indies inthe sixteenth century, more than 200 years later.Though Polo himself states frankly that he has never visited Japan – and thusthat what he has to say about it is second-hand and perhaps inaccurate – thenotion of the mysterious island kingdom of Cipango that he planted in Europeanconsciousness at the end of the thirteenth century was later one of severalpowerful influences that spurred Christopher Columbus forward in his crossingsof the Atlantic at the end of the fifteenth century. This was so becauseColumbus -underestimating the circumference of the earth and knowing nothing ofthe existence of the Americas or of the Pacific Ocean – believed that he couldreach Cipango, and thence the Chinese mainland beyond, by sailing directlywestwards across the Atlantic from Europe. Columbus is also likely to havecalculated that Cipango would be reached after only a relatively short journeytowards the west – for he had read Marco Polo, who describes Cipango,erroneously, as lying ‘far out to sea’ fully 1500 miles to the east of theChinese mainland4 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn4] (the truedistance is nowhere much more than 500 miles). Polo goes on to inform us that:[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_123_r1.jpg]Marco Polo’s return voyage from Quanzhou to Hormuz.Cipango … is of considerable size; its inhabitants have fair complexions, arewell made, and are civilized in their manners. Their religion is the worship ofidols. They are independent of every foreign power, and governed only by theirown kings. They have gold in the greatest abundance, its sources beinginexhaustible … The entire roof [of the sovereign’s palace] is covered with aplating of gold, in the same manner as we cover houses … with lead.5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn5]‘Gold in the greatest abundance,’ echoes Columbus in a marginal note beside thispassage in his own copy of Marco Polo’s Travels — now preserved at theBiblioteca Colombina in Seville.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn6]We will return to Columbus, and his obsessions.A ‘MAP’ OF ANTEDILUVIAN SRI LANKA?After traversing the Bay of Bengal, commenting en route on ‘the island ofAndaman’ (described as ‘a very big island’ inhabited by ‘a cruel race’ ofcannibals with heads, teeth and eyes like those of dogs)7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn7], Marco Polo’s homeward voyagebrought him to ‘the island of Zeilan – Ceylon – modern Sri Lanka.8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn8] In his account of Sri Lanka,which further illustrates his already established tendency to exaggeratedistances (in this case approximately tenfold) the Venetian travellernevertheless makes certain observations about the ancient geological history ofthe region that come remarkably close to the truth:The island of Zeilan presents itself. This, for its actual size, is bettercircumstanced than any other island in the world. It is in circuit 2400 miles,but in ancient times it was still larger, its circumference then measuring full3600 miles, as the Mappa-Mundi says. But the northern gales, which blow withprodigious violence, have in a manner corroded the mountains, so that they havein some parts fallen into the sea, and the island, for that cause, no longerretains its original size.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn9](Emphasis added.)This is the translation of William Marsden (1754–1836) from the Italian ofGiambattista Ramusio’s printed edition, dated 1553.10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn10] The more recent (1958)translation of Ronald Latham provides clarification of some elements of the samepassage:The traveller reaches Ceylon, which is undoubtedly the finest island of its sizein all the world. Let me explain how. It has a circumference of some 2400 miles.And I assure you that it used to be bigger than this. For it was once as much as3600 miles, as appears in mariners’ charts of this sea. But the north wind blewso strongly in these parts that it has submerged a great part of this islandunder the sea. That is why it is no longer as big as it used to be.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn11] (Emphasis added.)In yet another translation we read again that Ceylon in Polo’s day has acircumference of: ‘2400 miles … in old times it was greater still, for it thenhad a circuit of about 3600 miles, as you find in the charts of the mariners ofthose seas’.12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn12] (Emphasis added.)Despite slightly differing nuances, and what looks like a tenfold exaggerationfor distances, all the translations converge on two very clear and really quitestartling messages: 1. Ceylon was believed by Marco Polo to have been one-third larger in the past than it had become by his day – with extensive lands to the north of the present island said to have been ‘submerged under the sea’. In the process its circumference was reduced in size from 3600 units of measurement to 2400 units of measurement, i.e. by one-third. 2. Maps were in use amongst mariners in the Indian Ocean when Marco Polo was there – either mappamundi or mariners’ charts depending on the translation – which continued to show the one-third larger, antediluvian Ceylon.A REDUCTION BY ONE-THIRDOn the first of the two points above – the one-third reduction in the size ofSri Lanka by flooding – we cannot deny, having studied the inundation history ofsouth India and Sri Lanka in earlier chapters,13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn13] that the tradition which MarcoPolo here preserves and passes down to us is essentially correct when set withinthe time-frame of the end of the last Ice Age.Since approximately 7700–6900 years ago, when the last remnants of itsland-bridge to south India were inundated, Glenn Milne’s maps suggest that therehave been no significant changes in Ceylon’s size. Prior to 7700 years ago thepicture is very different, and as we go back through 8900 years ago, 10,600years ago, 12,400 years ago, and 13,500 years ago, we note a progressiveenlargement of Sri Lanka, exclusively in the north around the land-bridge tosouth India, resulting from the lowered sea-level of those epochs.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn14] At its greatest extent theenlargement is of the order of one-third.Polo’s quaint theory about how these former lands were lost through the actionof the north wind is wrong. But he is completely right when he tells us that SriLanka was much larger ‘in old times’, right when he tells us that its land-losstook place in the north, right again when he tells us that the lost land wassubmerged beneath the sea, and right yet again in his information thatapproximately one-third of antediluvian Sri Lanka was lost in this way.The question of how a Venetian traveller of the thirteenth century could haveequipped himself with such esoteric facts of palaeogeography brings us to pointtwo.WHERE DID POLO GET HIS INFORMATION FROM?Polo himself tells us only that he had learned of the former extent of Ceylonfrom an ancient ‘Mappa-Mundi’ or ‘mariners’ chart’ that he had seen, and heseems to accept without demur the obvious implication that this chart must haveoriginated before the epoch of inundation. As historian of cartography ThomasSuarez confirms, ‘Polo’s explanation of the size accorded Ceylon on the chartwas that the chart’s geography originated at an earlier time before much of theisland had been submerged.’15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn15]This is quite an extraordinary and interesting explanation, in my view. However,Suarez does not pursue it. He also ignores Polo’s clear suggestion that thechart showing a formerly much larger Sri Lanka was actually in use by ‘marinersof those seas’, rejects Polo’s explanation for the out-of-date geography of thechart (namely that it had come down from antediluvian times), and ratherdogmatically asserts his own theory that the ‘Mappa-Mundi’ or ‘mariners’ chart’Polo is referring to must be a Ptolemaic world map.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn16]Suarez admits that Ptolemaic world maps were only in extremely limitedcirculation in Europe in Polo’s time and are most unlikely to have been known tohim from any European source. But he is right also to point to the possibilitythat such maps could have been preserved amongst the Arabs trading in the IndianOcean, and that Polo could thus have seen a Ptolemaic map – without knowing itto be ‘Ptolemaic’ or recognizing it as such – during his stay in Ceylon.17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn17] Moreover, it is true that allPtolemaic world maps show the very large island of Taprobane in approximatelythe place where Sri Lanka/Ceylon might be expected to be found. Thus, Suarezconcludes that the chart referred to by Polo ‘followed the Ptolemaic model withits characteristic reversal of the relative proportions of Ceylon and India’.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn18]RETURN OF THE TYRIAN SEA-FISHSuarez’s logic is easy enough to follow: (1) Polo has been shown a Ptolemaicworld map, probably preserved by Arab seafarers in the Indian Ocean,19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn19] featuring the giant island ofTaprobana, which he takes to be Ceylon; (2) confronted by the much smallerCeylon of his own day he concludes that the map he has seen preserves an imageof Ceylon made before large parts of it were submerged; (3) he is incorrect inthis conclusion and his notion of a formerly enlarged Sri Lanka results onlyfrom his misunderstanding of a well-known error on all Ptolemaic maps.Yet this is surely only one possible explanation for Polo’s ‘knowledge’ ofobscure palaeogeographic facts – and one moreover that requires us to accept thesupposedly firm identification that Suarez makes between Sri Lanka/Ceylon andTaprobana (an identification that is generally but by no means universallyfavoured by modern scholars and ancient cartographers).20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn20]Another explanation for Polo’s apparent anachronistic knowledge might be thatthere is nothing to it at all and that he made the whole idea up, scoring a fewcorrelations with post-glacial reality purely by coincidence.Still another and by no means impossible explanation might be that Polo’saccount was in some way informed by the flood traditions of Sri Lanka and southIndia, reported in previous chapters, that speak of the lost Tamil homeland ofKumari Kandam.But as Polo does tell us quite explicitly that the source of his ancientgeographical knowledge about Ceylon was ‘mariners’ charts’ (‘charts of themariners of those seas’ or ‘Mappa-Mundi’) we should surely also consider anotherpossibility. This is the suggestion first raised by A. E. Nordenskiold anddiscussed in chapter 21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c21_r1.htm#c21] that a genre ofmaps older than the Ptolemaic maps and attributed to Marinus of Tyre was incirculation amongst the Arabs at least as early as AD 955 (the date of a directreference by the geographer Masudi, who, as the reader will recall, had ‘seenthe maps of Marinus’ which ‘by far surpassed those of Ptolemy’).21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn21] Nordenskiold argues that these‘Tyrian sea-fish’ maps formed the prototype for the mysteriously accurateportolans of the Mediterranean region that seem to appear suddenly in thecartographic record in the late thirteenth century. But, as we’ve seen, theportolan genre was never confined to the Mediterranean region alone. Thegreatest number of surviving examples of portolans do depict the Mediterranean,it is true. But from very early on portolan world maps also appear. Thoughsometimes contaminated by Ptolemaic ‘inserts’ or ‘patches’ in sections of theglobe for which, presumably, the cartographer had no portolan original at handto copy from, these in their own way are as startlingly precocious as theMediterranean portolans. To give just one example here, Piedro Vesconte’s worldmap of c.1321 shows Africa to be circumnavigable – in complete contradiction ofthe Ptolemaic tradition – more than one and a half centuries before thePortuguese finally circumnavigated it.Isn’t it possible, therefore, that the chart Polo saw in the Indian Ocean whichconvinced him that Ceylon had formerly been one-third larger than it was in hisday, that its lost lands had lain to the north, and that they had been submergedby the sea, could have been one of these ‘Tyrian sea-fish’ maps?STILL THE BEST AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS …Polo was not the only European traveller in the Indian Ocean to have seen veryinteresting maps in the hands of ‘mariners of those seas’. The reader willrecall that Vasco da Gama was also shown what seems to have been a highlysophisticated map by the navigator Guzarate, who guided him so rapidly fromMalindi in East Africa to Calicut on the west coast of India in 1498.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn22]It is important to stress, contrary to Suarez, that such maps, which wereclearly used by local navigators – and to all accounts used effectively – couldnot possibly have been Ptolemaic maps (whatever else they might have been). Thisis so because of the extreme and indeed almost grotesque inaccuracy of allPtolemaic maps of India/Sri Lanka – arising not only from the peculiar presenceof Taprobana (which may require a more complex interpretation than it hashitherto received) but also from the fact that India’s west coast is made to runparallel to the equator instead of roughly north-south as it does in reality.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn23] Mariners like Guzarate, or thosewho took Marco Polo to Ceylon, were men whose lives depended on knowing thewaters they sailed. Even if they had possessed a Ptolemaic map as a curiosity,we can be quite sure that they would never have taken the risk of actually usingit for navigation.This forces Suarez into the paradox – as he wraps up his argument for thePtolemaic provenance of the map Polo claimed to have seen – of having to takePolo’s direct reference to nautical charts (‘the charts of the mariners of thoseseas’) as evidence that such charts did not actually exist:The fact that the map seen by Polo retained such an incorrect dimension forCeylon supports the view that native pilots guided their vessels by navigationaltexts, and did not refer to the charts themselves.24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn24]It seems to me that something quite other than this is likely to be the case,since Polo makes no mention at all of navigational texts as the source for hisnotion of a formerly larger Ceylon, but does make very explicit mention ofcharts. We are now also clear that the charts he was referring to could not havebeen of Ptolemaic origin – simply by virtue of the fact that that they wereroutinely and successfully used by experienced local mariners in the IndianOcean. Last but not least we have seen that the issue of the very exaggerateddimensions given to Ceylon (by a chronicler admittedly prone to the exaggerationof dimensions) may be less important than the entirely correct notion Polopreserves that ‘in old times’ one-third of Ceylon had been swallowed up by thesea.Isn’t it possible that what confronts us here is another trace, like the briefreport of Masudi, of a parallel tradition of cartography (parallel, that is, tothe Ptolemaic tradition) that survived from antiquity into the Middle Ages andthat was associated by some with the works of Marinus of Tyre?25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn25] From the little that we alreadyknow and may reasonably speculate about these ‘Tyrian sea-fish’ charts, theyseem to have been acknowledged and recognized for their overall accuracy andexcellence despite having been overtaken in certain locations such as the northof Ceylon – as Polo testifies – by geological changes linked to flooding.It is the circulation of precisely such sophisticated yet curiously out-of-datecharts amongst Indian Ocean navigators like Guzarate, as we saw in chapter 21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c21_r1.htm#c21], that could provide the bestexplanation for the strange anachronistic perfection of the Cantino and Reinelmaps drawn by Portuguese cartographers in the early sixteenth century. Thereader will remember that these maps not only represent areas of the Indiancoast that the Portuguese had not yet visited but also show a number of detailedand inexplicable correlations, particularly around Gujerat and Cape Comorin,with India’s Ice Age coastline.KNOWLEDGE OF ICE AGE TOPOGRAPHY IN PTOLEMY TOO?When Sharif Sakr first drew Marco Polo’s comments on Sri Lanka to my attentionhe pointed out that ‘Polo’s primary assertion is that Sri Lanka had changed insize since ancient times, and that the old topography is preserved in nauticalcharts.’26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn26] In the same reportSharif also notes:Other historical characters apparently believed that Ptolemy’s maps depict anancient topography, for example with respect to a former land-bridge betweenMalaya and Sumatra, across the present Strait of Malacca.The Dutch adventurer Linschoten (1596) stated that some believed that Sumatrawas the Chersoneso Aurea [Golden Chersonese] of old, and that ‘in times past itwas firme land unto Malacca [Malaya]’.Camoes in his famous epic poem The Lusiads (1572), dealing with the birth ofPortugal as a nation, writes: ‘There is a saying that in ancient times the nobleisle of Sumatra was joined to the main, until mountainous seas eroded its baseand cut it off.’27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn27]Abraham Ortelius explained in a legend on his 1567 map of Asia: ‘It is true thatSamotra is not now a peninsula, but it is very likely that it was torn from thecontinent by the force of the Ocean after Ptolemy’s time. Moreover, if youimagine Samotra being joined to Malacca with an isthmus, it will agree very wellwith the shape of the Golden Chersonese as described by Ptolemy.’I think it is absolutely fascinating that this basic belief, that old maps coulddepict ancient and hence different topography, is so apparent in the writings ofadventurers who visited the Indian Ocean and must surely have been in contactwith ‘the mariners of those seas’. That Ortelius takes the contemporaryseparation of Sumatra from Malaya as evidence that the land changed since thetime of Ptolemy merely indicates his eagerness to try to understand whateversource information he had, and also his ignorance of the real geologicalprocesses that led to the separation of Sumatra from Malaya – at least 6000years before Ptolemy.28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn28]Readers who have come this far will already know enough inundation science torealize that there was indeed a time, at the end of the Ice Age, when the Straitof Malacca did not exist (as all the traditions quoted above correctly assert),when there was ‘firme land’ between Sumatra and the Malaysian peninsula, when‘the noble isle of Sumatra’ was ‘joined to the main’ – and so on and so forth.For this area was all part of a continuous, near-continent-sized peninsula thatgeologists call Sundaland, a once fertile exposed shelf of well-wateredlow-lying plains – extending as far south as Surabaya, as far west as thePhilippines and as far north as Taiwan – that was inundated in a series ofcatastrophic floods between 15,000 and 7000 years ago.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn29]How likely, therefore, is it to be an accident that the Ptolemaic world maps –said by Ptolemy himself to have been based on those of Marinus – do appear topresent a fair image of Ice Age Sundaland in the form of the great peninsulathat is labelled on those maps sometimes as the Golden Chersonese and sometimesas the peninsula of Mangi? Isn’t it at least equally probable, as Ortelius wasalready more than half way to suggesting 500 years ago, that this ‘mythical’peninsula is a genuine echo of Ice Age topography?Likewise, it may be significant that the Cantino world map of 1502, which wehave suggested could have come down to us directly through theMarinus-to-portolan ‘line’ (rather than indirectly via Ptolemy’s abridged and‘corrected’ version of Marinus), also shows a vast peninsula reminiscent of theexposed Sunda Shelf.Given the highly anomalous traditions cited by Linschoten and Camoes concerningthe flooding of the Strait of Malacca – traditions that are anomalous purely andsimply because of their remarkable convergence with palaeogeographic facts – itseems almost perverse not to consider the possibility that certain maps, too,might have preserved reflections of the Ice Age world.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_124_r1.jpg]Waldseemüller’s ‘Golden Chersonese’, AD 1507.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_125_r1.jpg]The Golden Chersonese as shown in the Cantino planisphere, c. AD 1502.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_126_r1.jpg]Exposed Sunda Shelf at the LGM.But traditions, with all their folksy redolences, are relatively safe mattersfor scholars to speculate about. Maps and nautical charts on the other hand-especially accurate, sophisticated maps of the kind used by Guzarate to chartVasco da Gama’s course from Malindi to Calicut in 1498 – are quite anothermatter. If maps have indeed come down to us containing recognizablerepresentations of Ice Age topography – as arguably may be the case with thedepictions of India and of the long-submerged Sundaland peninsula by Cantino andReinal and with the depiction of the ‘Golden Chersonese’ by Ptolemy – thenprehistory cannot be as it has hitherto been presented to us.If they are what they seem, such maps mean a lost civilization. Nothing more.Nothing less.‘A PIECE OF A MAP …’In 1937 the eminent Portuguese map historian Armando Cortesao, an indefatigablesearcher after lost cartographical treasures, discovered – in Paris – ‘thelong-sought codex containing the Suma Oriental of Tome Pires and the Book ofFrancisco Rodrigues’.30 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn30]During the years 1512–15 when he wrote his Suma (now recognized as ‘the mostimportant and complete account of the East produced in the first half of thesixteenth century’)31 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn31] Tome Pireshad been the first official Portuguese ambassador to China.32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn32] For some inexplicable reason,however, his great work lay ‘forgotten and practically unnoticed’, untilCortesao brought it to light again in the twentieth century.33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn33] This was all the more puzzlingbecause the Suma proved to be bound together in the same codex with anothervolume which, far from being forgotten, had been sensationally republished (inan abridged, illustrated edition) in the 1849 Atlas of the Viscount deSantarem.34 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn34] This second volumewas the Book of Francisco Rodrigues, containing detailed written sailingdirections and ‘precious maps’ (with compass roses and rhumb lines) drawn in theearly sixteenth century by Rodrigues himself – a true portolan in other words.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn35] Unlike the famous Tome Pires –with whom it was nevertheless his fate to end up bound between two covers – anddespite the publicity given to his maps in Santarem’s Atlas, Francisco Rodriguesis virtually unknown. Indeed, says Cortesao, so little is known about him that:It is impossible even to attempt a biographical sketch. Besides the informationwe can gather from Rodrigues’ Book itself, he is mentioned in two letters ofAlfonso de Albuquerque to King Manuel of Portugal written from Cochin, 1 Apriland 20 August 1512.36 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn36]The suspicion that European travellers in the Indian Ocean in the sixteenthcentury may from time to time have stumbled across charts and maps containingthe remnants of a lost geography (perhaps even the maps of Marinus of Tyre, saidto have been superior to those of Ptolemy) is intriguingly enhanced by the firstof Alfonso de Albuquerque’s two letters. It introduces a ‘piece of a map’ thatAlbuquerque has acquired in his travels in the Indian Ocean and that he issending to King Manuel. This fragment, he explains, is not the original but was‘traced’ by Francisco Rodrigues from:a large map of a Javanese pilot, containing the Cape of Good Hope, Portugal andthe land of Brazil, the Red Sea and the Sea of Persia, the Clove Islands[effectively a world map, therefore], the navigation of the Chinese and theGores [an unidentified people, thought by some to be the Japanese, or theinhabitants of Taiwan and the Ryukyu archipelago]37[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn37] with their rhumbs and directroutes followed by the ships, and the hinterland, and how the kingdoms border oneach other. It seems to me, Sir, that this was the best thing I have ever seen,and Your Highness will be very pleased to see it; it had the names in Javanesewriting, but I had with me a Javanese who could read and write.38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn38]This report of the tracing by a Portuguese cartographer (Rodrigues) of a mapowned and used in the Indian Ocean by a Javanese pilot – and for no less aperson than the Portuguese king himself – casts a very unusual sidelight oncartographic history. The events unfold in the early sixteenth century whenPortugal was at the height of its maritime power and believed to be surpassed bynone in its mapmaking sciences and achievements. Yet here we have a Portugueseemissary proudly sending back to his monarch a mere tracing of a mere fragmentof a map owned by a Javanese pilot as though it were a classified militarydocument of the highest order!Remember that this is 1512 – a full decade after the superb Cantino map wascreated in Portugal. Some map scholars believe that the Cantino may have greatlyresembled the padrao - the top secret ‘master map’, incorporating all the latestknown discoveries, as well as relevant information from ancient charts, to whichthe kings of Portugal had special access. At the very least we can be absolutelyconfident that in 1502 the Portugese monarch would have had a map at least asgood as the Cantino – and probably much better. Likewise, we can be certain,with continuous feedback from ever-widening Portuguese expeditions, that thepadrao of 1512 would have been far superior to the padrao of 1502.So it is against Manuel’s privileged access to such a superb Portuguese worldmap as the padrao that we must weigh the enthusiasm with which his emissaryAlbuquerque sends him a tracing of a fragment of a Javanese pilot’s map acquiredin the Indian Ocean, describing it as ‘the best thing I have ever seen’ andassuring the King that ‘Your Highness will be very pleased with it.’GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE FAITH INNothing – absolutely nothing at all – makes any sense of Albuquerque’s letterunless the Portuguese themselves had reason to believe that maps were availablein the Indian Ocean, in the hands of pilots of various nationalities, that mightbe better than their own. And, as we’ve seen before with such rumours ofsophisticated ancient maps, there is also the recognition that they willsometimes have been outdated by geological changes. Thus, in the Suma OrientalTome Pires informs us that:The Gujaratees were better seamen and did more navigating than the other peopleof these parts, and so they have larger ships and more men to man them. Theyhave great pilots and do a great deal of navigation.39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn39]Yet mysteriously he also tells us that it has only been since about 100 yearsbefore his own time that these Gujeratis (the countrymen of da Gama’s highlyskilled pilot Guzarate), had found the route through the Strait of Malaccabetween Sumatra and the Malaysian peninsula.40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn40]This is strange because (a) the Gujeratis described by Tome Pires obviously knewa thing or two about navigation; and (b) the Strait of Malacca was being used byships long before the fifteenth century – in the thirteenth century, after all,Marco Polo had sailed through it.How are we to explain this anomaly? ‘Could it be,’ suggests Sharif Sakr,that the Gujeratis possessed maps (Ptolemaic or otherwise) which failed to showthe Strait of Malacca, such that they had either lost knowledge of it, or suchthat Pires had speculated, having seen such maps, that the Strait was onlyrecently discovered?41 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c22-ftn41]In other words, could the Gujeratis have been working with maps showing Ice Agetopography?We’ve already seen that the ‘mistakes’ on otherwise technically excellent mapsof India such as the Cantino of 1502 and the Reinal of 1510 can be explainedthis way – as the results of Portuguese borrowings from Ice Age maps somehow inthe hands of Gujerati navigators. So maybe the anomalous and unexpected Gujeratiignorance of the Strait of Malacca reported by Tome Pires is part of the samesyndrome? Maybe the Gujerati navigators used maps that showed the Strait as‘firme land’ from Sumatra Malacca – as it last looked about 8000 years ago – andsimply didn’t bother to find out that things had changed. Maybe the old mapswere generally quite good enough, despite such faults, to justify faithfulreliance? That would make a strange kind of sense of the way in which theGujeratis are reported to have adhered for so long to a much more roundaboutroute than the one through the Strait that was used by their competitors.But is there any other evidence, except in maps of the Indian Ocean, whichreally suggests the survival of Ice Age topography?THE LEGENDARY HY-BRASIL – A GLACIAL REALITYREPORT BY SHARIF SAKR, 10 MARCH 2001Irish folklore tells of a small but significant island called Hy-Brasil, lyingin the Atlantic Ocean not too far off the western coast of Ireland. The tale isat least as old as AD 1110, which is the date of the first written record of it(The Voyage of Maeldiun). The tale almost certainly existed prior to this, foran unknown length of time, as an oral record. Gaelic legends appear to hold thatthe land was lost to the ocean, but makes a brief reappearance once every sevenyears, such that it can be seen from the Irish mainland if one is standing inthe right place.Happily for us the legend of Hy-Brasil made its way on to the portolan charts ofthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. These graphic representations give a farmore detailed and precise insight than verbal or written traditions ever couldinto what was believed about the size and location of the island.The first recorded depiction of Hy-Brasil in a map is in the Dulcert portolan of1325 or 1330. It appears again on Dulcert’s 1339 portolan-opposite. Althoughfaint, it should be obvious that the map is generally very accurate. It evenshows the tiny lump of rock known as Rockall, which was occupied by Greenpeacerecently as part of a demonstration against oil-drilling in the area. Note,however, that the tiny land of Rockall is somewhat enlarged on the Dulcert map.There are very similar depictions of the legendary island of Hy-Brasil on manyother portolan charts, which probably represent copies (or copies of copies) ofsome original (perhaps the Dulcert, but probably some older portolan chart).Below is part of the Catalan Atlas of 1375. Its representation of the BritishIsles is typical of all portolans, including the Dulcert, and, in addition tothe legendary Hy-Brasil, its characteristic errors include a dry Donegal Bay onthe north-west corner of Ireland.The next map, overleaf, comes from the Ptolemaeus Argentinae collection of 1513,which represents a successful hybridization of the Ptolemaic and portolantraditions.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_127_r1.jpg]Hy-Brasil (circled) as shown on the Dulcert portolan, AD 1339.Can it be coincidence that there is a relatively shallow submerged bank – it ismarked on modern sea-charts as the Porcupine Bank – in exactly the same place asthe legendary island shown on all these ancient maps?Glenn Milne is currently unable to produce reliable inundation maps of thisregion with the required zoom and detail, partly because the region is so closeto the ancient British ice-sheet – the exact behaviour of which has not yet beenfully incorporated into the model. However, for our purposes bathymetrical mapswill serve just as well. The one overleaf is state-of-the-art, with a resolutionof 2 minutes. Depth can be gauged through the shading as well as by the contourline which I have placed at a depth of 55 metres beneath today’s sea-level.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_128_r1.jpg]Hy-Brasil as shown on the Catalan Atlas of AD 1375.The light-shaded Porcupine Bank can easily be seen directly west of Ireland, inexactly the same place, and roughly the same size, as the legendary Hy-Brasil onthe portolan charts. The entire bank lies between 40 and 200 metres beneath thesurface, and most of it (probably more than 600 square kilometres) would havebeen exposed at the Last Glacial Maximum, 21,000 years ago.The correlation between Porcupine Bank and Hy-Brasil on the portolans is, in myview, too close to be coincidental. Even Robert Fuson, Professor Emeritus ofGeography at the University of South Florida, is convinced that Hy-Brasil isbased on real observation. But rather than consider an Ice Age origin for thelegend, he suggests it is based on some unknown but recent tectonic event. But Ido not think it is necessary to speculate about recent tectonic cataclysms, oreven to go all the way back to the LGM, in order to find a good correlationbetween past geography and the portolans. The black contour line is set at 55metres below current sea-level and reveals that there would have been asignificant island, with an area of perhaps 100 square kilometres, in thelocation of the legendary Hy-Brasil even in the later stages of the glacialmeltdown -around 12,000 years ago.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_129_r1.jpg]Hy-Brasil as shown on the Ptolemaeus Argentinae of AD 1513.Other features of the portolans correlate better with Ireland as it looked atthis later period than with the geography at the Last Glacial Maximum. Theisland of Rockall was enlarged, such that it had roughly the same size as shownin the Dulcert and Argentinae maps. (Note that there would probably also havebeen two much smaller islands in the vicinity of Rockall, which are not shown onthe portolans.) Also as shown on the maps, the Bay of Donegal, at the north-westshoulder of Northern Ireland, would have been dry land and there would have beena large island immediately off this coast. The many islands that today lie offthe west coast of Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Scotland would havebeen incorporated into the Irish and Scottish mainlands respectively, but wouldhave been replaced by other small islands further to the west which are nowsubmerged but which are in keeping with the islands shown on the old maps. Thesame goes for the Isle of Man, which would have been replaced by a similar-sizedisland slightly further to the south. The Outer Hebrides would have been asingle massive landmass, as represented on the Dulcert portolan (although thismap has the island slightly too far south and east).[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_130_r1.jpg]Bathymetric map of Ireland, with grey contour line at depth of 55 metres.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_131_r1.jpg]41.

Even stranger, as we shall see in the nextchapter, are two other islands – the fabulous Antilia and Satanaze – whichbeckon like the Holy Grail. They first appear on an anonymous portolan chart of1424, and subsequently on many other maps of the fifteenth and sixteenthcenturies. Yet the islands themselves have never been found.Is this because they never existed? Or might there be a better explanation?"},{"pageContent":"23 / LOOKING FOR THE LOST ON THE ROAD TO NOWHEREThere lies in the Ocean an island which is called The Lost. In Charm and allkinds of fertility it far surpasses every other land, but it is unknown to men.Now and again it may be found by chance; but if one seeks it, it cannot befound, and therefore it is called The Lost.Honorius of Autun, De Imagine Mundi, about AD 11301[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn1]Give me some ships and I will find a new world for you.Christopher Columbus, about AD 14802[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn2]For some reason that has never been explained properly there was, for a verylong while before the time of Christopher Columbus, a firm and entirely correctbelief amongst mariners in ancient Europe and around the Mediterranean that vastlands and extraordinary islands awaited discovery and colonization somewhere tothe west across the wastes of the Atlantic Ocean. The belief was expressed inlegends and traditions, some of which have been preserved down to modern times,and also in graphic form on maps and nautical charts.The mystery of Hy-Brasil, introduced in the last chapter, is part of this verythorny unsolved problem of anachronistic geographical knowledge and, at the sametime, a microcosm of the whole issue: * Ancient references to Hy-Brasil exist both in legendary and traditional oral and written sources and in maps dating back as far as the fourteenth century – for example the Dulcert portolan. * Belief in the existence of Hy-Brasil – i.e. physically, in the Atlantic Ocean somewhere – was strong enough to have inspired expeditions to find it. Records have survived of two such expeditions, the first led by a certain John Lloyd, that were sent out from the port of Bristol in the west of England in AD 1480.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn3] * The location given to the ‘legendary’ island of Hy-Brasil by medieval mapmakers correlates strongly and closely with the location of the submerged Porcupine Bank – which was unknown in medieval times but parts of which, as we’ve seen, would have been exposed as an island at the end of the Ice Age.THE TROUBLE WITH HY-BRASILIf it were simply a matter of an old legend of a lost Atlantic island somewhereto the west of Ireland, and modern bathymetry showing a shallowly submerged bankin roughly the same vicinity, the most probable explanation would becoincidence. The appearance of Hy-Brasil on maps, however, cannot be accountedfor so easily. Scholars universally conclude that these representations are nomore than imaginative graphic expressions of pre-existing written and oraltraditions. The consensus view is that medieval cartographers referred to manysources in constructing their maps, including legends. Since Hy-Brasil isobviously a ‘legendary’ island, it follows that the shape and location given toit on the maps must have come from legendary sources. But if the cartographerwho placed Hy-Brasil on the Dulcert portolan were working only from legends hewould have been free to draw it anywhere to the west of Ireland – giving himwide scope. What, therefore, must be the odds against his having imagined anisland that is not only approximately the right size to match the antediluvianPorcupine Bank but that is also placed in exactly the spot on the map where thePorcupine Bank would have been exposed at the end of the Ice Age?It could all be the result of some sort of extraordinary coincidence, I admit.Or it could be that the cartographer worked from a source map – like thehypothetical source maps behind the Cantino and Reinal world portolans – thatsomehow depicted genuine Ice Age topography and coastlines?As we’ve seen in previous chapters, it is not unreasonable to suppose that mapsbelonging to the tradition of Marinus of Tyre could have been preserved inpockets in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere alongside the better known maps ofClaudius Ptolemy. Nor is it impossible, as Arab eye-witnesses as late as thetenth century attest, that the original maps of the ‘Tyrian sea-fish’ might havebeen superior to those of Ptolemy (despite Ptolemy’s own propaganda to thecontrary). It is not wild speculation on my part, but the argument of thedistinguished historian of cartography A. E. Nordenskiold, that the preservedmaps of Marinus may have formed the original corpus out of which emerged theastonishingly sophisticated portolan tradition in the thirteenth and fourteenthcenturies. And it is a fact that the earliest representations of Hy-Brasil –Dulcert, Benincasa and many others – all appear on portolan charts.There will be ways for scholars to underplay the significance of this, I’m sure.But what Hy-Brasil looks like to me is evidence not only for the survival of anancient non-Ptolemaic mapmaking tradition but also for the preservation withinthe tradition of accurate records of Ice Age topography and coastlines. That inturn more or less automatically makes the tradition itself extremely ancient;logically it must be at least as old as the Ice Age features it represents.Moreover, despite its great antiquity, it is a mark of the respect accorded tothe general accuracy and reliability of this tradition by mariners down the agesthat expeditions to find Hy-Brasil – and other ‘ghosts’ of Ice Age topography –were still being launched as late as the fifteenth century. Though there seemsto have been an inkling that cataclysmic changes and floods had intervened, aswe saw in the last chapter, I think it is unlikely that the seafarers who setout from Bristol in 1480 to search for Hy-Brasil could have imagined that theisland given that name on their portolan charts had been swallowed up by the seamore than 11,000 years previously.I anticipate the objection that it is inconceivable for a mapmaking tradition tohave survived for 11,000 years. But why should it be inconceivable? Don’t wealready have in Ptolemy a mapmaking tradition that has survived – verifiably-for 2000 years? And doesn’t Ptolemy himself state that his Geography is acorrection of the earlier work of Marinus of Tyre, who in turn was supposedlyonly the ‘most recent student’ of this ancient discipline? Nothing compels us toimagine, therefore, that the ‘Marinus’ tradition began with Marinus a fewdecades before Ptolemy. On the contrary, Ptolemy’s references suggest thatMarinus of Tyre (if this was not actually a generic term that was used to referto a certain category of nautical maps) was simply the latest custodian andredactor of a body of geographical knowledge preserved from a far more remoteantiquity.Perhaps it was their custodianship of this knowledge that made the Phoenicianssuch inquisitive explorers of the margins of the Atlantic (which laternavigators feared and called ‘the Sea of Darkness’)4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn4] as though they were searching,always searching, for something that lay just beyond the next horizon …HINTS OF A LOST ATLANTIC GEOGRAPHYAccording to the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the first centuryBC,There lies out in the deep off Libya [Africa] an island of considerable size,and situated as it is in the ocean it is distant from Libya a voyage of a numberof days to the west. Its land is fruitful, much of it being mountainous and nota little being a level plain of surpassing beauty. Through it flow navigablerivers …5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn5]Diodorus goes on to tell us how Phoenician mariners, blown off course in astorm, had discovered this Atlantic island with navigable rivers quite bychance. Soon its value was recognized and its fate became the subject of disputebetween Tyre and Carthage, two of the great Phoenician cities in theMediterranean:The Tyrians … purposed to dispatch a colony to it, but the Carthaginiansprevented their doing so, partly out of concern lest many inhabitants ofCarthage should remove there because of the excellence of the island, and partlyin order to have ready in it a place in which to seek refuge against anincalculable turn of fortune, in case some total disaster should overtakeCarthage. For it was their thought that since they were masters of the sea, theywould thus be able to move, households and all, to an island which was unknownto their conquerors.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn6]Since there are no navigable rivers anywhere to the west of Africa before theseafarer reaches Cuba, Haiti and the American continent,7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn7] does this report by Diodorus rankas one of the earliest European notices of the New World?Likewise, what did Lucius Annaeaus Seneca have in mind in his Medea (C.AD 50)when he wrote:In later years there will come a time when Oceanus [the Atlantic] shall loosenthe bonds by which we have been confined, when an immense land shall be revealedand Tiphys [the pilot of Jason’s legendary ship Argo] shall disclose newworlds.8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn8]Seneca’s strange observation reads like a weirdly accurate prophecy of theinevitable discovery of the Americas. But is it too accurate to be guesswork?Had he seen a map that showed an immense land literally waiting to be revealedon the far shores of the Atlantic?THE OPPOSITE CONTINENTThe suspicion that certain ancient authorities possessed good knowledge of thereal shape of the Atlantic and its islands, and of the lands on both sides ofit, must also arise from any objective reading of Plato’s world-famous accountof Atlantis.As we have seen in earlier chapters, this story is set around 11,600 years ago –a date that coincides with a peak episode of global flooding at the end of theIce Age. The story tells us that ‘the island of Atlantis was swallowed up by thesea and vanished’, that this took place in ‘a single dreadful day and night’ andthat the event was accompanied by earthquakes and floods that were experiencedas far away as the eastern Mediterranean.9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn9] But of more immediate interest tous here is what Plato has to say about the geographical situation in theAtlantic immediately before the flood that destroyed Atlantis:In those days the Atlantic was navigable. There was an island opposite thestrait [the Strait of Gibraltar] which you [the Greeks] call the Pillars ofHeracles, an island larger than Libya and Asia combined; from it travellerscould in those days reach the other islands, and from them the whole oppositecontinent which surrounds what can truly be called the ocean. For the sea withinthe strait we are talking about [i.e. the Mediterranean] is like a lake with anarrow entrance; the outer ocean is the real ocean and the land which entirelysurrounds it is properly termed continent … On this island of Atlantis hadarisen a powerful and remarkable dynasty of kings who ruled the whole island;and many other islands as well, and parts of the continent …10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn10]Whether or not one believes that an island called Atlantis ever existed in theAtlantic Ocean, Plato’s clear references to an ‘opposite continent’ on the farside of it are geographical knowledge out of place in time. It is hard to readin these references anything other than an allusion to the Americas, and yethistorians assure us that the Americas were unknown in Plato’s time and remained‘undiscovered’ (except for a few inconsequential Viking voyages) until Columbusin 1492.THE MYSTERIOUS BOOK OF COLUMBUSA curious anteroom to the Columbus story exists. It is prefigured in the Irishlegend of the voyage of Saint Brendan – the earliest surviving version of whichappears in Adamnan’s Life of St Columba, written before AD 704.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn11] Brendan is said to have sailedacross the Atlantic from Ireland in the sixth century AD with a group of monkson an eventually successful expedition to find ‘an immense region in the west …the Land of Promise’.12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn12]Once again we are reminded that the ancient seafaring nations of Europe and theMediterranean were imbued through and through with the same geographical ideathat enlightened Plato – the idea that a rich and almost limitless oppositecontinent awaited those daring enough to attempt the Atlantic crossing. And onceagain the obvious questions arise. Where could the idea of the oppositecontinent have come from? Why should it have arisen in the first place? How dowe account for its persistence down the ages in so many different cultures fromthe Phoenicians to the Irish?In 1513, in handwritten notes on an enigmatic map that he had prepared showingthe newly discovered Americas, the Turkish Admiral Piri Reis offered anintriguing answer to all these questions – at any rate for the particular caseof Christopher Columbus, the most recent and most renowned of the ancientAtlantic dreamers. Piri’s note, one of many on the same map, is written over theinterior of Brazil:Apparently a Genoese infidel, by the name of Columbus was the one who discoveredthese parts. This is how it happened: a book came into the hands of thisColumbus from which he found out that the Western Sea [i.e. the Atlantic] has anend, in other words that there is a coast and islands on its western side withmany kinds of ores and gems. Having read this book through, he recounted allthese things to the Genoese elders and said, ‘Come, give me two ships, and Ishall go and find these places. ‘They said, ‘Foolish man, is there an end to theWestern Sea? It is filled with the mists of darkness.’13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn13]It seems to me that there are two points of enormous interest about thisreported ‘book’ of Columbus. First, we are told that it showed the oppositecontinent, with its coast and islands, on the western side of the Atlantic.Taken at face value, therefore, what we have here is a clear reference to theexistence of a pre-Columbian map of the Americas – a notion that runs completelycontrary to the accepted history of science. Secondly, we are led to understandthat it was on account of what he had learned in this remarkable book – no othercause is mentioned – that Columbus began to tout his proposed expedition topotential sponsors.One might question the bona fides of a Turkish admiral claiming to have anyinside knowledge at all of the voyages of Christopher Columbus; however, in thiscase such questions appear to be misplaced. Recent scholarship by map historianGregory Mcintosh has confirmed that one of the twenty or so source maps to whichPiri Reis tells us that he referred to compile his own map was almost certainly– as Piri claims – a chart of the Caribbean that had been drawn by Columbushimself.14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn14] The implication isthat some fairly direct link must have existed between the two men and Piriinforms us of such a link. He says that he acquired his inside information aboutColumbus from a Spaniard captured by Turkish corsairs after a naval battle inthe Mediterranean. This ‘Spanish prisoner’, as Piri calls him, had sailed withColumbus on three of his four voyages to the New World.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn15][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_151_r1.jpg]Piri Reis map, 1513.Piri’s reference to the mysterious ‘book’ of Columbus can therefore be tracedback to a reliable source. But I have yet to find a single orthodox map scholar,Gregory Mcintosh included, prepared to look further into the potentiallycontroversial and important revelation that the book contained a pre-Columbianmap of the Americas. On the contrary, the revelation is dismissed as manifestlyincorrect. In consequence those few scholars who have devoted any thought at allto the ‘book’ have ignored the one definite lead that Piri gives us about it-namely that it showed how the Atlantic Ocean came to an end in an oppositecontinent with its own coast and islands – and instead have speculated that itmight have been a copy of Cardinal D’Ailly’s Imago Mundi, or of Marco Polo’sTravels: ‘books which influenced Columbus’s plan of sailing west to reachAsia’.16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn16] To this GregoryMcintosh adds: ‘In the Bahriye Piri Reis refers to the book that influencedColumbus in terms that indicate it may have been Ptolemy’s Geographia.’17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn17]Needless to say, the orthodox paradigm of the discovery of the New World is safeif the mysterious ‘book’ that supposedly motivated Columbus can be reduced to aknown, non-threatening quantity like the Geography or the Travels. And it ispossible, since all the texts named above recognize the earth to be a sphere,that any one of them, and probably all of them, might have played a part inshaping Columbus’s well-known conviction that Asia could be fetched by sailingwest from Europe.None of this, however, permits the conclusion that the ‘book of Columbus’ towhich Piri Reis refers was in fact one of these texts. Indeed, though the pointis passed over in silence by Mcintosh, it seems extremely unlikely that it couldhave been. The named texts were already well known in Europe when Columbus wasseeking support for his expedition and were not viewed by anybody as proofpositive that either a New World, or Asia, lay on the other side of theAtlantic. If all he had to impress sponsors was information that they alreadyhad at their disposal from those texts, then he would not have convinced anyone.In other words, if there was a ‘book of Columbus’ which played the importantpart that Piri gives to it, then it must have been a much rarer and lessfamiliar text than any of these and it must logically have contained new andmore persuasive information about the far coasts of the Atlantic.WHY NOT TAKE PIRI AT FACE VALUE?Piri Reis is not only remembered for his 1513 map but for another slightly laterwork, a manual of sailing directions known as the Bahriye, which also containsreferences to the book of Columbus.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn18] Reported above is Mcintosh’simpression from comments made in the Bahriye that the ‘book’ Piri is speaking ofmight have been Ptolemy’s Geography. Yet the Turkish scholar Svat Soucek pointsout that this is not the obvious deduction from the text of the Bahriye where ittouches on ‘the great story of the discovery of America’:The country’s name is Antilia, and it was discovered by a Genoese muneccim(astronomer-cum-astrologer) named Columbus … The story goes all the way back toAlexander, who had roamed the whole earth and written a book about it. The bookremained in Egypt until the Muslim conquest, when the Franks fled the country,taking the book with them. Little attention was paid to it until Columbus readit and realized the existence of Antilia to the west of the Atlantic. Heconvinced the king of Spain of the possibility of its discovery andcolonization, which he then successfully carried out.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn19]I find it difficult to agree with Mcintosh that Piri might have had Ptolemy’sGeography in mind as the book that inspired Columbus – for the Geographyconsists of dry and uninspiring coordinates mapping out the Oikumene (theinhabited world as known to the ancient Greeks) and has nothing to say one wayor the other about the western terminus of the Atlantic nor of any place such asAntilia. Moreover, Mcintosh’s conclusion requires us to ignore Piri’s own veryclear and unambiguous attribution of the original authorship of the ‘book’ toAlexander the Great and to accept instead that when Piri wrote ‘Alexander’ hereally meant ‘Claudius Ptolemy’.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn20] The argument for this trulyoutrageous act of second-guessing, and denigration of the intelligence andeducation of Piri Reis, goes something as follows: (1) Alexander the Great, aMacedonian, invaded Egypt and established the city of Alexandria; he was veryfamous; (2) after Alexander’s death his general Ptolemy Soter, also aMacedonian, also very famous, declared himself pharaoh and founded the Ptolemaicdynasty; (3) almost 400 years later the astronomer Claudius Ptolemy (no relationto Ptolemy Soter, but famous too) compiled his Geography at the library ofAlexandria; (4) Piri Reis mixed up all the facts about these famous people andplaces in his own mind and churned out the hilariously incorrect conclusion thatthe book that had convinced Columbus of the existence of the New World hadoriginally been written by Alexander the Great.21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn21]Rather than going through such convolutions, which ultimately just pour scorn onhim, I fail to understand what is so terribly wrong with taking Piri at facevalue. Why not simply credit him with enough learning and intelligence to haveknown the difference between Alexander and Ptolemy? Why not explore thepossibility that Columbus really could – exactly as Piri says – have beenmotivated to attempt his Atlantic crossing after having seen a very old book, asurvival from the time of Alexander the Great, in which the western shores ofthe Atlantic were shown?The questions are purely rhetorical and there is one answer for all of them.Scholars cannot take Piri Reis at face value on the subject of the book ofColumbus because this would mean accepting the possible existence not just of apre-Columbian map of the Americas (itself a historical heresy of the highestorder), but of a pre-Ptolemaic map of the Americas dating back at least to thetime of Alexander the Great – i.e. to the fourth century BC.The maps of Marinus of Tyre were pre-Ptolemaic and have not come down to us.Thus we do not know and can only speculate about their true antiquity, theirorigins, their contents, and about what they showed and did not show before the‘improvements’ and ‘corrections’ that Ptolemy implemented. But if A. E.Nordenskiold is right to suggest a genetic link between the lost corpus ofMarinus and the remarkably advanced portolan charts that began to appear fromthe late thirteenth century onwards then, in a sense, anything is possible.We have seen that these portolans contain strange echoes of the Ice Age world –suggesting that some of the source maps on which they were based may have beendrawn thousands of years ago, before the post-glacial sea-level rise. If that isthe case, then why shouldn’t the as yet unidentified prehistoric culture orcultures that made these maps have ‘discovered’ and charted the Americas aswell?The survival of such maps, or copies of copies of copies of them, among marinersin the Mediterranean and along the Atlantic seaboard of Europe since timeimmemorial would explain the ancient yearning to discover an ‘immense land’ inthe west. It would explain the ancient certainty that such a land was there. Andit would explain why, down the generations, hard-headed seafarers andadventurers were again and again prepared to mount hazardous expeditions to tryto find the great continent and islands that the maps told them lay out in theAtlantic.So what about the most famous Atlantic island of all? What about Atlantis?THE ATLANTIS-ANTILIA MYSTERYPlato’s story of Atlantis, though it contains no diagrams, nevertheless summonsup an accurate mental picture of the Atlantic Ocean – bounded to the east byEurope and Africa and bounded to the west by the vast enclosing arc of the‘opposite continent’.In the midst of the Atlantic Plato then presents us with another geographicalimage, this time supported by quite specific chronological data. The image is ofthe great island of Atlantis, no longer extant, that was swallowed up by the sea9000 years before the time of the Greek lawmaker Solon. This suggests a date ofaround 9600 BC for the submergence of Atlantis – a date that falls in the midstof the cataclysmic meltdown of the last Ice Age.We’ve seen that the topographical ghosts of other inundated Ice Age islands,like Hy-Brasil and the unnamed island off the southern tip of India portrayed onthe Cantino and Reinal maps, mysteriously begin to appear on portolan charts andworld maps from the fourteenth century onwards. If Atlantis was also an islandsubmerged by rising sea-levels at the end of the Ice Age, and not just a figmentof Plato’s imagination as many suppose, then is it possible that its spectre toocould haunt the portolans?A number of researchers believe that they have found the ghost of Atlantismanifesting as a large, roughly rectangular, ‘mythical’ island named Antiliathat began to appear on portolan charts in the first half of the fifteenthcentury. The earliest surviving example was drawn in Venice in 1424 and isattributed to the cartographer Zuane Pizzagano.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn22] It is not known what source mapshe may have been working from. Together with a second large ‘mythical’ island-named Satanaze – that Pizzagano portrayed lying to the north, Antilia went onto enjoy a long and ubiquitous life in global cartography and was not finallyexorcized from most charts and atlases until the eighteenth century.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn23] As was the case with Hy-Brasil(which in fact survived on one nautical chart until the middle of the nineteenthcentury)24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn24] there was also at onetime a firm belief amongst mariners in the physical existence of Antilia – firmenough at any rate to have inspired several voyages of discovery.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn25][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_152_r1.jpg]Pizzagano chart, 1424.Map sleuth George Firman points out that the positions of Antilia and Satanazeon the 1424 and later charts lie extremely close to, if not exactly on top of,the huge subterranean mountain range, connected to the world’s tectonic system,that geologists today know as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn26] Proposing what is essentially anamplified version of the ‘forebulge effect’ described in chapter 3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03],27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn27] Firman suggests that downwardpressures on the continental landmasses of Northern Europe and North Americaduring the Ice Age could, through isostatic compensation, have forced themid-Atlantic Ridge upwards, perhaps far enough upwards to have elevated itshighest peaks and plateaux above water for as long as 40,000 years before theice-sheets went into meltdown.28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn28]Conversely, with the removal of the downward pressure exerted on the continentsby the ice-masses as the meltwaters poured back into the world ocean, thetemporary uplift of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge would have ceased and subsidencepressures would have begun to build. As sea-levels rose, and as the isostaticrebound of the continents continued, it is then theoretically possible that theentire ridge, as Firman puts it, could have been plunged into the depths of theAtlantic Ocean ‘at the same approximate time’.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn29][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_153_r1.jpg]Firman believes that such an event did occur ‘between the years 9500–8000 BC’,30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn30] that the 1424 chart containsantediluvian information, and that in its portrayal of Antilia and Satanaze itprovides us with:the original location of the last two main islands of Atlantis. Both islandsconform to the bottom topography of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and of the adjoiningAzores Plateau … The largest island, to the south, is the main island on whichthe capital cities of the empire were located.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn31]It is true that Plato speaks of more than one island in the Atlantean empire.32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn32] And I have come across somepeculiar reports (mainly from Soviet oceanographic sources between the 1950s and1980s) of deeply submerged underwater ruins – including such features as stonecolumns, buildings and stairways – on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the Azores.33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn33] Since none of these reports everseems to have been followed up, the possibility remains that Firman could yet beproved right and that the existence of sunken cities will one day be confirmedin the Mid-Atlantic. But the search area and the search depth are far too greatfor individual divers to be of any use. It will take a well-funded oceanographicinstitute with submersibles and a lot of time at its disposal to settle thismatter.Recent investigations indicate that there is ‘weird geology’ down there whichmay perhaps provide a simple explanation for the Soviet sightings of allegedruins. On 13 July 2001, for example, ABC News in the United States released thefollowing science story picked up from the 12 July issue of Nature:More than 2000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Plato wrote about a splendidcity named Atlantis, with fertile soil and glorious temples, that ‘in a singleday and night of misfortune … disappeared into the depths of the sea’.Now researchers probing the ocean bottom have found 18-story-high towers ofstone deep in the ocean near a section of volcanic fault ridges that extend for6200 miles along the Atlantic floor [the Mid-Atlantic Ridge].The majestic height of the two dozen stone structures and their location on aseafloor mountain named Atlantis Massif inspired the scientists to name the area‘Lost City’ in honor of the fabled flooded city referred to by Plato.The underwater stone spirals are unusual for their composition and location …‘It was clear these were unlike anything we’d ever seen before,’ said DeborahKelly, an oceanographer at the University of Washington … The Lost City is alsostrikingly bright – brighter than the usual conditions in which things cangenerally be seen using artificial light a half-mile below sea-level. Althoughother rock formations around volcanic ridges have appeared black, the newlydiscovered formations are gleaming white because they are made up of materialssimilar to those of pale concrete, such as carbonate minerals and silica.34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn34]Could there be more to this story than meets the eye? Could this be a real lostcity that is being mistaken for weird geology? Highly unlikely, I should say-but, honestly, who knows what’s really down there, seen and unseen?Meanwhile, geological opinion, with good reason, remains solidly set against anyinvolvement of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantis mystery. Galanopoulos andBacon sum up the consensus nicely:There never was an Atlantic landbridge since the arrival of man in the world;there is no sunken landmass in the Atlantic; the Atlantic Ocean must haveexisted in its present form for at least a million years. In fact it is ageophysical impossibility for an Atlantis of Plato’s dimensions to have existedin the Atlantic.35 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn35]This statement is certainly correct – and doubly so if we are to envisage‘Atlantis’ actually sinking into the ocean through some abrupt isostatic event(as opposed to being inundated by rising sea-levels). Yet while it is indeedimpossible for a landmass ‘larger than Libya and Asia combined’ to have existedin the Atlantic, it is also only fair to point out that the ghost islands ofAntilia and Satanaze depicted on the 1424 chart are in the range of just 500kilometres long by 200 kilometres wide and thus come nowhere near Plato’sextraordinary dimensions for Atlantis. Moreover, inundation science reveals thatthree islands the size of Antilia and Satanaze -islands that are todaycompletely submerged or that have survived only in the form of tiny remnantsstill above sea-level – did in fact exist in the Atlantic down to as late as6000 years ago (although much nearer America than the Mid-Atlantic Ridge).36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn36][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_154_r1.jpg]One of these lost islands was formed by a large section of the Great BahamaBank, which stood more than 120 metres above sea-level at the Last GlacialMaximum. Today all that is left of this imposing antediluvian landmass is therugged island of Andros to the southeast and tiny Bimini to the north-west,facing the Gulf Stream and the Florida peninsula.Off the north-west coast of Bimini, running parallel to the Gulf Stream, is whatappears to be a huge submerged man-made structure – an impressive megalithicengineering work made of enormous blocks laid side-by-side to form an underwater‘road’ more than 800 metres long. At its southern end the structure curvesshoreward, giving it the shape, quite visible from the air, of a reversed letter‘J’. Towards its northern end it divides into two parallel tracks separated byopen sand. Closer to shore two additional smaller sections of ‘road’, each about300 metres long, run parallel to each other at an angle to the main axis of the‘J’.Some people say the whole complex is a vestige of Atlantis. Others say it’s justthree outcrops of natural blocky beachrock. But neither side has yet seriouslyconsidered the problem in the light of inundation science and what it has totell us about sea-level changes and land-loss in this corner of the AtlanticOcean at the end of the Ice Age.THE RISE AND FALL OF THE BIMINI ROADThe ‘Bimini Road’ varies between 5 and 7 metres in depth. Situated in an area ofgenerally calm blue water that reaches a temperature of 30 degrees centigrade inthe summer months it therefore represents just about as unthreatening a dive asit is possible to experience in scuba gear. A kilometre to your south isParadise Point on north Bimini island. A kilometre to your east is a beach ofpicturesque white sand. To your west, were you to follow it over a distance of 3kilometres, you would find that the sea-bottom slopes down in gradual incrementsto a depth of about 100 metres before the abyssal drop-off into the Gulf Streamis reached.This deepwater channel between Bimini and Florida was always there and filledwith the ocean, even at the Last Glacial Maximum. But the submerged site of theBimini Road and much of the sea-bed between it and the channel were above waterthen – and may have remained so until about 6000 years ago. Whether natural orman-made, therefore, the site would have enjoyed a spectacular and significantantediluvian location at the top of a long gentle slope overlooking the GulfStream.The Road was discovered in 1968 by a team of volunteers, all of whom wereconnected with varying degrees of closeness to an organization called theAssociation for Research and Enlightenment (ARE). A harmless, good-willed butdottily eccentric American cult with Christian and spiritualist values and anageing membership, the ARE has its headquarters in the coastal resort ofVirginia Beach, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, and promotes the teachings ofthe healer and psychic Edgar Cayce (1877–1945). Cayce claimed to have lived apast life as an Atlantean more than 12,000 years previously and before his deathhe prophesied that the ruins of Atlantis would begin to emerge from the sea in1968 or 1969. He was quite specific about where this would take place somewherenear Bimini. The apparent fulfilment of the prophecy with the 1968 discovery ofthe great rows of underwater megaliths off Bimini’s Paradise Point thereforemade for sensational headlines.37[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn37][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_155_r1.jpg]Initially, high hopes were raised that the irrefutable proof of Plato’s lostcivilization had at last been found. Then there came a devastating scientificbacklash which seemed to demonstrate coolly and professionally that the BiminiRoad was not a man-made megalithic structure after all, but an entirely naturalfeature that could be explained simply by geology without any need to invokepsychic archaeology or the master masons of an imaginary lost civilization.Mahlon Ball, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, University ofFlorida, and John A. Gifford, University of Miami, writing in NationalGeographic Research Reports, vol. 12, 1980, pages 21–38The rise of sea level from 15,000 BP to the present produced a succession ofbeaches that formed on the outer platform off the west coast of North Bimini asthe shoreline transgressed eastward over the Great Bahama Bank. Along thesetransient beaches deposits of beachrock formed and subsequently were submergedas the water over them deepened … [After several thousand years] the shorelinemigrated to a position approximately one kilometre north of the present ParadisePoint. Here over a period of perhaps 700 years, three successive beaches werethe site of the formation of three parallel, linear deposits of beachrock …38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn38] The following observations weremade during our initial field investigation: 1. The three features are unconnected at the southwest end; scattered blocks are present there, but do not form a well-defined linear feature connecting the seaward, middle, and shoreward features. 2. No evidence exists anywhere over the three features of two courses of blocks, or even a single block set squarely atop another. 3. Not enough blocks lie in the vicinity of the three features to have formed a new-destroyed second course of blocks. 4. Bedrock closely underlies the entire area of the three features, eliminating the possibility of excavations or channels between them. 5. No evidence was found of blocks being cut into or founded on the underlying bedrock surface. 6. No evidence was found of regular or symmetrical supports beneath any of the blocks. 7. We saw no evidence on any of the blocks of regular or repeated patterns of grooves or depressions that might be interpreted as tool marks. 8. [None of the features] is well founded or continuous enough to have served as some kind of thoroughfare.In fact the only attributes of the three linear features that suggest a humanorigin are the regular shapes of the blocks. These are also attributes ofnatural beachrock deposits.39 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn39]W. Harrison, Environmental Research Associates Inc., writing in Nature, vol.230, 2 April 1971, pages 287–9The blocks are believed to have originated as follows. A shell-hash gravel wasdeposited in shallow water as relative sea-level fell during the most recentemergence of the Bahama Banks, and later brought into the fresh waterenvironment. The materials were cemented and joints formed in the material as isusually the case with limestones. After two sets of practically right anglejoints had developed, submergence of the area brought the jointed coquinalimestone first into the breaking zone of waves and then the offshore zones.Wave action probably caused much of the initial separation into blocks, but whenthe formation was further offshore the destructive activity of marine life wouldhave become dominant.The overall result is a field of blocks that at first sight appear to have beenfitted together, and this has led to statements such as ‘some human agency musthave been involved’. The blocky remains of the limestone outcrop are, however,no more enigmatic than other subaerial or subaqueous outcrops of jointedlimestone found in various stages of fracture and decay in the north-westernBahamas.40 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn40]Marshall McKusik, University of Iowa, and Eugene Shinn, US Geological Survey,writing in Nature, vol. 287, 4 September 1980, pages 11–12Amateur enthusiasts have claimed that the Bimini blocks were quarried by ancientAtlanteans and laid out in an ancient ‘Cylopean, megalithic roadway’… However,the limestone structures observed off Bimini in 15 feet [5 metres] of sea haveall the features of natural beachrock. The limestone is in a narrow band andextends for a considerable distance along a former shoreline … The tabularfractures are natural and the original slope to the sea is present. A sample of17 oriented cores obtained by Shinn and Tomkins has been examined withX-radiographs. Two areas of the formation were studied, and both show slope anduniform particle size, bedding planes and constant dip direction from one blockto the next. If the stones had been quarried and relaid there is no reason tosuppose bedding planes would carry stratigraphically from block to block. Thesedimentary laminations clearly show that these were not randomly laid stonesbut a natural, relatively undisturbed formation.Although under 15 feet of water, the beachrock is of recent geological origin.One C-14 date on shell has already been published as 2200 plus or minus 150years BP. Jerry J. Stipp (Radiocarbon dating lab, University of Miami) has runseven bulk samples from cores as a class project and gives slightly older datesfor the Bimini submerged beachrock [varying from 2745–3510 BP].41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn41]THE ROAD TO NOWHEREThe last point cited above, the carbon-dating of organic materials in the stoneof the Bimini Road, is potentially the most devastating of all the evidencepresented by science against the claimed ‘Atlantean’ origin for the site. Platoput the submergence of Atlantis sometime close to 11,600 years ago and the AREprophet Edgar Cayce proposed 12,500 years ago. Either way, the C-14 dating ofthe Road to between 2200 years ago and 3500 years ago seems, at a stroke, torule out any Atlantean or indeed any very ancient connection.Despite the apparently overwhelming and self-evident case for a natural andrecent origin of the site, there were fightbacks and rebuttals by some of theoriginal discoverers of the Road, including the oceanographer Dimitri Rebikoffand Dr J. Manson Valentine of the Miami Museum of Science. A Ph.D. from YaleUniversity (in zoology, palaeontology and geology), and latterly Research Fellowin entomology at the Bishop Museum in Hawaii, Dr Valentine was a polymath whoemerged as the unlikely spokesman for the pro-Atlantean group. Writing in theExplorers Journal in December 1976, he acknowledged the hostile response ofother academics (mainly marine geologists) but argued that the sceptics had sofar fallen ‘far short of explaining’: 1. why the stones of the Bimini complex are of flint-hard micrite (unlike soft beachrock, it rings when struck with a sledge and will not cleave under the same treatment); 2. why the three short courses of closely fitted stone are so straight-sided, mutually parallel and terminate in corner stones; 3. why the long avenue lies at a slight angle to the others and is composed of a double series of small blocks interrupted by two expansions containing very large, flat stones propped up at their corners by vertical members (like the dolmens of western Europe); 4. why the southern end of this great, wide track swings into a beautifully curved corner; and, finally, 5. how to account for all the rectangular shapes, right angles and rectilinear configurations associated with this complicated site as seen from the air.42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn42]Likewise, in 1978 Dr David Zink, another pro-Atlantean with academiccredentials, presented evidence questioning the uniformity at the microscopiclevel of adjacent beachrock blocks at Bimini (suggesting deposition in anentirely natural way) that had been alleged in the scientific reports:The cementing of the sections – composed of marine life forms and crystallineforms of calcium carbonate – was not alike. One sample was dominated byaragonite crystals, another by sparry calcite. This implied that adjacent stoneswere formed in different chemical environments.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn43]Together with Terry Mahlman, David Zink also presented a paper at a conferenceon underwater archaeology held at the University of Pennsylvania in January1982. The paper raised a number of serious reservations about anomalies in thesequence of very young carbon-dates that had been published in Nature andelsewhere. The authors pointed out that these dates, between 2200 and 3500 yearsago in the case of Nature, and between 3200 and 6000 years ago in the case ofanother study, do not square with solid information now in the hands of marinegeologists concerning Atlantic sea-levels since the end of the Ice Age:The radiocarbon dates of the site, when matched with known Atlantic sea-levelsat the same dates, put the megalithic blocks either above or below the tidalzone at the time of their formation. Because of the need for a tidal environmentin which to form beachrock, and because sea-levels in the Atlantic for the pastthirteen thousand years are the most solid elements of the Bimini problem, weare left with the likelihood that the dates are unreliable.[For example] two of the megalithic blocks dated by an early investigator, thefirst from the seaward side of the site and the second from a position 100metres toward the beach, yielded dates which conflict with the theory of an insitu origin for them. The seaward block was dated by radiocarbon to c.4000 BC.In its present position it would have been about 23 feet above the tidal zone.Clearly it would have been impossible for it to have formed as beachrock by theknown process. The second block, located 100 metres closer to the present beachand at the same depth, was dated by radiocarbon to c.1200 BC. In its presentposition at that date this block would have been about eight feet below thetidal zone.The literature on dating methods suggests that even ground-water contaminationon land can render radiocarbon dates too young. How much greater an error mightbe introduced by the continuous addition of calcium with an ever-increasingproportion of the C-14 isotope as occurs in micritization of beachrock? For allthese reasons the dates presently assigned to these blocks would appear to beunreliable.44 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c23-ftn44]Despite these and other reasoned attempts to keep interest alive in the BiminiRoad as a possibly man-made and possibly very ancient site, the Nature andNational Geographic reports had hit the scientific credibility of the subjectlike cruise missiles. Likewise, souring after their initial flirtation withAtlantis and the Cayce prophecy, the tabloid media soon lost interest and movedon.In such a way the Road to Atlantis became the road to nowhere."},{"pageContent":"24 / THE METAMORPHOSES OF ANTILIAIt’s just a fact of life in this case that no one and no organization is goingto fund a prehistoric underwater archaeological survey of the Bahamas.John Gifford, University of Miami, July 2001Friends, come, come with us on this voyage! Here you’re creeping about inpoverty; come and sail with us! For with God’s help we’re going to discover aland that they say has houses roofed with gold.Martin Alonso Pinzon, Captain of the Pinta, recruiting crews for Columbus, 1492Before I spent two weeks diving at Bimini in August 1999 this was my honestopinion: David Zink and Manson Valentine were wrong and the marine geologistsfrom Florida were right; the Bimini Road was a natural formation. But after thediving I wasn’t quite so sure.I still felt the force of the scientific arguments, but now I’d also experiencedthe force of the great structure underwater and my reaction to it was not thesame as the reaction of the geologists. Where they’d seen a ‘natural’ formationof tabular beachrock with uniform particle sizes, constant dip direction and notool marks, artefacts or other signs of human intervention, I’d seen somethingthat looked like a majestic work of art or sculpture – perhaps a colossal mosaic– something, at any rate, that felt coherent, organized, purposive, planned,idiosyncratic and designed. It is true that beachrock does fracture into jointedblocks, and that examples of this process can be seen in Bimini today and aroundmany other Bahamian islands (in fact it forms so quickly that bottle tops andother modern items are frequently found cemented in the matrix). However nothingI have ever seen that is definitely and unassailably beachrock, either on Biminior anywhere else, really looks like the Bimini Road.We dived with Trigg Adams, a salty old sea dog and former Eastern Airlines pilotwho’d been one of the original discoverers of the Road back in the days ofManson Valentine. We used his yacht the Tryggr, which he brought over the GulfStream from Miami under motor power, for the duration of our trip. And we alsotook advantage of Trigg’s flying skills to go tearing around the skies in achartered plane for a couple of hours so that we could see the Road and othermysteries of Bimini from the air.Despite haze and cloud that morning we had no difficulty in spotting the 800metre long, 20 metre wide main axis of the reverse-J with its characteristicshoreward curve to the south-east. It was also easy to make out the point atwhich the axis bifurcated into two narrower parallel piers, each 5 metres wide,separated by a 10 metre wide strip of sand running all the way to the northernterminus of the structure. Through the crystal-clear water we could even seeindividual blocks – some of them gigantic, some much smaller, all seeminglyarranged and oriented in a highly organized manner. The two shorter segmentsshoreward of the ‘J’ ran absolutely parallel to one another and again showedinteresting combinations of small and large blocks – including sevenparticularly enormous megaliths lying side by side near the southern end of theinner segment.Trigg took the plane higher and circled several times over the enormousunderwater mosaic. It reminded me, I realized, much less of a road or any kindof thoroughfare than it did of the great earth diagrams – the long straightlines and the animal, insect, bird and fish figures – of the Nazca plateau insouthern Peru. Whether by accident or by design these works of geometry andstone sprawled out on an ancient Atlantic beach and, long since submergedbeneath the sea, had something of the same sense of scale and grandeur whenviewed from the air. I was therefore intrigued to discover, as we continued theflight over Bimini’s two main islands and lagoons, that in several denselywooded and uninhabited areas there were stony mounds with exposed surfaces thesize of tennis courts on which nothing grew. The surface of one mound, onlyvisible from the air, took the shape of a huge sea-horse. The surface of anotherwas shaped like a giant fish complete with realistic fins and tail and, again,could only ever have been seen from the air. A third mound was geometrical,offering a rectangular surface to the sky.In all the discussions and academic papers I have read in which the Bimini Roadis described as a natural beachrock formation I have never once seen anycomment, one way or another, on these peculiar and distinctive mounds. Are theyalso to be dismissed as natural formations of no interest to the archaeologist?And if not – if they are man-made – then shouldn’t they be taken into account inany attempt to judge the provenance of the nearby ‘Road’?DIVING THE BIMINI ROADShallow dives sometimes don’t feel like real dives. There’s not that sense ofchallenge, that frisson of danger, that you get when you’re down deep. Just 5 or10 metres below the surface you would have to be very stupid and very persistentto risk the bends or a lung-expansion injury. So Bimini was a gentle and kindlyplace to be underwater. Even the occasional nurse shark sulking in the shelterof one of the great blocks just looked like he might be dangerous but wasn’treally. And at these depths a full tank of air went a very long way.The typical Bimini block is of dark, extremely hard stone, measures about 2metres in length by a metre in width by half a metre high, weighs about a tonne,is pillow-shaped, slightly convex, and rounded off at the corners and edges.Many others are much smaller but there are dozens of true monsters of 5 tonnesor more, with a few selected individual blocks verging towards 15 tonnes.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_156_r1.jpg]Outline drawing of the Bimini Road. Based on Zink (1978).Contrary to the National Geographic Society research report I found that certainblocks in the 5–15 tonne range – some exceptional examples of which measured asmuch as 5 metres across – were propped up on small vertical supports, apparentlyof a completely different stone type, resembling stubby pillars. The effect ofthese supports – sometimes as many as five at a time – was to lift the bigblocks completely clear of the bedrock foundation so that you could seeunderneath them from one side to the other.I supposed that these were the ‘dolmens’ that Manson Valentine had spoken of inone of his reports – certainly there was nothing else on the Bimini Road thatfitted this description. But despite a superficial resemblance – big blockspropped on top of smaller blocks – these structures obviously weren’t dolmens. Iwondered if the little vertical ‘pillars’ were just bits of loose rock that hadbeen lying around on the sea-bed and that had been washed under the big blocksby tides or storm swells. But if so, why were they only under the biggest andheaviest blocks – the ones that would have been hardest for storms to shiftaround – and not under the smaller, lighter ones?I spent days drifting up and down the Road, trying to get my bearings on it andto figure out what it is. Around noon with the sun most directly overhead andthe underwater visibility at its best, the long straight avenues of blocksseemed to stretch away for ever in either direction. Mostly they lay directly ontop of the extensive plateau of exposed limestone bedrock but sometimes theywould disappear completely under sand-drifts, only to reappear on the otherside, keeping the same heading.Within the overall theme of parallelism other recurrent patterns were alsoevident – blocks arranged in circles, groups of three blocks of different shapescombined to form a triangle, seemingly deliberately fashioned cornerstones‘finishing off’ a square or rectangular arrangement of dozens of blocks – and soon and so forth. There were also groupings of similar-sized blocks such as theseven very large megaliths near the southern end of the inshore pier laid sideby side next to much smaller blocks pursuing the same axis. In this case theseven large blocks crossed the full width of the axis. The smaller blocks nextto them continued along the same axis and to the same width but were arranged intwo parallel rows separated by a cleared area.NATURAL AND YOUNG, OR MAN-MADE AND OLD?So what is the Bimini Road? Is it a natural formation and not very old? Or, inspite of all the scientific objections, could it be a man-made megalithicstructure – even a remnant of Atlantis – covered by rising sea-levels manythousands of years ago?To begin with the natural-versus-artificial debate, I do not think that thescientists have either proved that it is a natural formation or proved that itis definitely not a man-made formation – which would amount to the same thing.For example, the research report from the National Geographic Society quoted inchapter 23 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c23_r1.htm#c23] claims that there is noevidence anywhere on the site of courses of blocks having been piled on top ofone another and that not enough scattered blocks lie in the vicinity to haveformed a now-destroyed second course. This is taken as evidence in favour of thenatural origin of the Bimini Road; however, I see no good or logical reason whyhumans should not have chosen from the outset to construct a structure onecourse high. Moreover, no consideration is given to another option – which isthat the immense structure did have more than one course in the past but thatthe blocks are no longer there because the vast majority of them have beenremoved. Although there may be no connection, elementary research amongstelderly islanders has uncovered several eye-witness reports of barges fromFlorida that used to quarry stone underwater off Paradise Point during the 1920sand take it back to Miami for use in construction projects. As the islanderstell it, the barges repeatedly visited the area to carry off stones over aperiod of several years.1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn1]Another example of the scientific criticism of the proposed artificiality of theBimini Road that I find disappointing is the National Geographic Society’s claimthat there are no regular or symmetrical supports beneath any of the blocks.This is flatly contradicted by my own experiences diving on the Road.We’ve even seen that the evidence for microscopic uniformity within the stones,which plays such a key part in the scientific argument for a natural origin ofthe site, has not gone uncontested. Zink and others have had quite different andequally bona fide results from their own drill cores, which indicate blocksadjacent to one another in the formation that were not formed side by side butin different chemical environments. The implication of this is that, while thereis no doubt that the material used in the Bimini Road is beachrock (none of thepro-artificiality researchers have ever argued that it is anything else), itremains possible that beachrock deposits were cut, shaped, manipulated andarranged by human hands.In their 1982 paper for the Society for Historical Archaeology’s Conference onUnderwater Archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania, Terry Mahlman andDavid Zink sum up the central thrust of the pro-artificiality defence:The most controversial aspect of this site is the history of the megalithicblocks. More directly put, are they beachrock blocks cut and shaped by man orwere they formed naturally in situ? Their composition, most agree, is micritizedshell hash, or beachrock, which through the continued process of solution andrecrystallization of its cement by sea water rich in calcium carbonate hasbecome extremely hard in comparison with modern beachrock. The authors of thispaper theorize that, after their original formation in a beach environment,these blocks were removed, shaped and placed above water by human agency. Lateras the sea-level continued to rise after the last glacial period, the blockswere again covered and micritization commenced. Newly formed beachrock is easilyworked in comparison with the blocks of the site. Their extreme hardness causedthe destruction of the diamond bit of our 80mm core barrel after only 12 coreshad been taken.Micritization, once again the on-going replacement of the calcium carbonatecement binding the shell hash, also contributes to the problem of dating theseblocks. This is because the new cement contains an increasingly higherproportion of Carbon 14, thus making the sample appear younger than it actuallyis.2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn2]This brings us to the question of the age of the structure. Have orthodoxscientists at least proved their case, as McKusik and Shinn claim, that some ofthe stones used in the Bimini Road might be less than 3000 years old?Again, I don’t think so. The situation of the megaliths is ideally conducive tothe production of falsely youthful radiocarbon dates – and these young dates arefurther contradicted by the depth of submergence of the sites. As McKusik andShinn themselves admit:Testing of submerged features in Florida and one test on North Bimini islandshows that the sea level has risen at a rate of about one inch every 40 yearsfor the past 5000 years. This rate of submergence over 2200 to 3500 years [therange of radiocarbon dates for the stones published by McKusik and Shinn] wouldaccount for 5.58 to 7.22 feet of the 15 feet of sea observed over thebeachrock.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn3]Ignoring the fact that the depth of the Bimini Road is generally greater than 15feet, McKusik and Shinn account for ‘the remaining 7 to 9 feet of sea’ by ‘theundermining of sand, allowing the beachrock to gradually settle’.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn4] This explanation, however, cannotwork in the case of the seaward block cited earlier and carbon-dated to c.4000BC – i.e., around 6000 years ago. At that date the block would have been wellabove the tidal zone and thus unable to form as beachrock at all. Mahlman andZink’s suggestion that there could have been contamination leading to falselyyouthful carbon-dates from the tests on the Bimini Road therefore seems areasonable one.THE MYSTERY OF CAHO SAN ANTONIO: A POSSIBLE UNDERWATER CITY OFF CUBAIn my opinion a mistake shared by the polarized and mutually suspiciouscommunities that have studied the Bimini Road – both those who favour anartificial origin for the site and those who believe it to be entirely natural –has been to confine the arguments solely to dry debate about drill cores,micritization, shell hash, bedding planes, C-14, and suchlike. Meanwhile other-mainly contextual – issues have been underplayed.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_157_r1.jpg]One entirely new issue, which could well prove to be contextual to the Biminiproblem if it checks out, was put before scientists on 14 May 2001, when ReutersNews Agency published an astonishing report of the apparent discovery of acomplete city submerged in more than 700 metres of water off the west coast ofnearby Cuba.5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn5] The team that hadmade the discovery were not psychic Atlanteans but a consortium of scientistsand salvage experts who had secured an exclusive concession from the governmentof Cuba to conduct searches for shipwrecks in Cuban waters. Such a search hasnever before been permitted and, though expensive to mount, is likely to provevery lucrative – since experts believe that billions of dollars’ worth of sunkenSpanish treasure ships lie in the deeps off Cuba.6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn6]What one would not expect to find in water anywhere near as deep as 700 metreswould be a sunken city – unless it had been submerged by some colossal tectonicevent rather than by rising sea-levels. Mind you, the two are not necessarilycontradictory and a colossal tectonic event occurring amidst an epoch of globalsea-level rise seems to be exactly what is suggested in the Atlantis myth.Some soundbites from the Reuters report:‘It’s a new frontier’, enthused Soviet-born Canadian ocean engineer PaulineZelitsky, from British Columbia-based Advanced Digital Communications, poringover video images of hitherto unseen seafloor taken by underwater robots.‘We are the first people ever to see the bottom of Cuban waters over 50 meters …It’s so exciting. We are discovering the influence of currents on globalclimate, volcanoes, the history of formation of Caribbean islands, numeroushistoric wrecks and even possibly a sunken city built in the pre-classic periodand populated by an advanced civilization similar to the early Teotihuacanculture of Yucatan,’ she said.The report then tells us that, ADC, Zelitsky’s company, is ‘the heavyweightamong four foreign exploration firms here’ and that, merely while testing itsequipment in Havana Bay, it successfully located the wreck of the USS Mainewhich blew up and sank mysteriously in 1898:ADC has also been exploring a string of underwater volcanoes about 5000 feetdeep off Cuba’s western tip, where millions of years ago a strip of land oncejoined the island to Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.Most intriguingly, researchers using sonar equipment have discovered, at a depthof about 2200 feet, a huge land plateau with clear images of what appears to beurban development partly covered by sand. From above, the shapes resemblepyramids, roads and buildings.‘It is stunning. What we see in our high resolution sonar images are limitless,rolling, white sand plains and, in the middle of this beautiful white sand,there are clear manmade large-size architectural designs. It looks like when youfly over an urban development in a plane and you see highways, tunnels andbuildings,’ Zelitsky said.‘We don’t know what it is and we don’t have the videotaped evidence of this yet,but we do not believe that nature is capable of producing planned symmetricalarchitecture, unless it is a miracle,’ she added in an interview in her officeat Tarara, along the coast east of Havana.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn7]As the first edition of Underworld goes to press, the status of Cuba’sunderwater city remains unresolved. Is it a city? Or is it just a wonderfulsonar hallucination? Presumably time will tell.To clarify matters as much as possible in the meantime I asked Sharif to do acouple of telephone interviews. The first was with Paul Weinzweg, co-founder ofAdvanced Digital Communications (and husband of Pauline Zelitsky), whoconfirmed:The sonar images we have are very extensive, the structures extend over severalkilometres. They’re very large. Some as long as 400 metres. Some are up to 40metres high. They’re of different shapes. But there’s a good deal ofarchitectural symmetry. We’ve shown them to scientists in the US, Canada andCuba… and they tell us that it’s not geology, or that it’s a great mystery … Andwe have very extensive bathymetry of that area as well, and it is veryinteresting that the shelf terraces down in even gradations. And it’s obviousthat if it is a major settlement of say a pre-classical or Atlantean nature,then the whole thing just sank, altogether, during some disastrous geologicalevent. There are a couple of fault lines there, and an ancient volcano … It’soff the coast of Cabo San Antonio, off the Western tip of Cuba …8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn8]One of the scientists named by Weinzweg as supporting a possibly non-geologicalnature for the structures in the sonar images is Dr Al Hine, a marine geologistat the University of South Florida. He described what he’d seen on the imagesthat Pauline Zelitsky had shown him as:Just bizarre. I couldn’t provide an explanation for it but on the other handthere might be a reasonable explanation. They want to turn it into anarchaeological site. I suppose that’s possible but there are just as manyalternative interpretations that could be valid as well. It’s something worthyof further study, I suppose … But it was something that didn’t really jump outat you. It was kinda vague and it might be something real or it might not be.That’s the way it is with looking at acoustic geophysics on the sea-floor.9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn9]Additional relevant comment came from Grenville Draper of Florida InternationalUniversity, an expert in the neotectonics of Cuba and its region, who thought ithighly improbable that tectonic subsidence sufficient to have plunged severalsquare kilometres of land to a depth of 700 metres below the sea could haveoccurred any time during the known human occupation of Cuba:Nothing of this magnitude has been reported, even from the Mediterranean. Theonly other possibility is that the ‘objects’ were carried into position by anunderwater landslide, something possible, even probable, in the Cabo San Antonioregion.10 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn10]INUNDATION HISTORYThe odds in favour of the Cuban underwater city actually turning out to beanything of the sort don’t look particularly good to me. But it would be nice tobe surprised and we shall have to wait and see.Meanwhile there are other more immediate contextual issues surrounding theBimini Road that have never been examined. For example, no serious attempt hasbeen made to explore the possibility that some sort of cultural relationshipmight exist between the ‘Seahorse’ and ‘Shark’ mounds above water on Bimini andthe geometrical mosaic of the now-submerged Bimini Road. Likewise, there hasbeen a failure by both sides to consider the topography of Bimini and itschanging relationship to the sea since the end of the Ice Age. For until asrecently as 6000 years ago, as I was to discover when I received Glenn Milne’sinundation maps for the region in the summer of 2001, Bimini remained part of alarge antediluvian island lying across the Gulf Stream from Florida. Very closeto the north-western tip of this palaeo-island, overlooking the Gulf Stream thenas they do today, were what is now Paradise Point and the present site of theBimini Road.My question is this. Doesn’t the existence of a large and perhaps inhabitedisland in the immediate vicinity of the Bimini Road until around 6000 years agosuggest the possibility that vital information concerning the Road’s originscould now also be underwater? How can anyone arrive at certainties about thisenigma when, as remains the case today, no extensive underwater archaeology hasever been done on the Great Bahama Bank?In July 2001 after my second series of dives at Bimini, this time with theChannel 4 film crew, I flew to Florida to put these doubts to Dr John Gifford ofthe University of Miami, co-author of the National Geographic Society researchreport quoted earlier, and one of the leading scientific proponents since theearly 1970s of an entirely natural origin for the Bimini Road.GH: John, when did your involvement with Bimini begin? When did it all start,and why?Gifford: I came to the University of Miami as a graduate student in September of1969, and at that time there were articles in the local newspapers describing adiscovery that had just been made off the coast of North Bimini, which wasdescribed as Atlantis, and the Dean of the school at the time, F. G. WaltonSmith, decided that this would be a great project for someone who was interestedin both archaeology and geology, as I was, so he essentially told me to go overthere and study it and find out whether it was archaeological or geological.GH: Right. And was that the main focus of your research on Bimini – thatspecific question? Or was it wider?Gifford: It was, because at the time, again, in the fall of ’69, it was a major,major news story, and people were calling this place and saying, you know, ‘Whatcan you tell us about Atlantis?’ and so we wanted to be on top of things.I was interested to note, when I questioned Gifford on the age of the BiminiRoad, that he did not rely on the disputed carbon-dates from the cores, butinstead on the dates of seashells found under the blocks.GH: Setting aside for a moment the argument about whether the Bimini Road is inany way artificial or not, how old do you think it is?Gifford: That particular deposit is somewhat less than about 6000 or 7000 yearsold.GH: And that’s based on what? How do you arrive at that?Gifford: One of the things we accomplished in my fieldwork there back in theearly ‘70s, was to excavate underneath the blocks at a number of locations, andwe recovered very well-preserved marine shells, mollusc shells. Weradiocarbon-dated those and the dates on the shells all fell between 6000 and7000 years old.I next pointed out to Gifford that our inundation maps showed a large islandbehind the Bimini Road down to about the same period – a solid mass of landquite different from the tiny strips of rock and sand that are all that remainof it today. ‘I don’t know what kind of landmass it was,’ I said. ‘Has your workever touched on that?’Gifford: No, no.GH: But it strikes me that it might have been quite a habitable place at thetime, when North America was covered in a vast ice-sheet … Gifford: Sure.GH: And therefore possibly a place where people lived?Gifford: Well, that’s something that has occurred to a number of people,including myself, and so the first step, of course, would be to go to theBahamas and look for very early archaeological sites not only underwater but onland.GH: On land too. Yes.Gifford: But out of all the archaeological surveys that have been done today onall the islands in the Bahamas, the oldest site that has ever been found on landis only about 3000 years old. There is simply nothing older than that.GH: How much marine archaeology has been done in the Bahamas?Gifford: Well, prehistoric marine archaeology, very, very little. Certainlythere’s been a lot of treasure-hunting for shipwrecks and so forth, but onlywithin the last decade or so have some people begun to do things like explorethe Blue Holes in the Bahamas. Those are obvious places where one might look forprehistoric remains. And I’ve heard reports of human bones being found at greatdepth in some of these Blue Holes, but I think in most cases the bones have beenintroduced much, much more recently and they’ve simply fallen down in theslopes. So my point is though, you see, if you’ve got an exposed Bahama Bank –thousands of square kilometres – and you’ve got people wandering around, atleast some of those people are going to leave some traces on the high points,which are then going to become the islands, which would then be places whereland archaeologists would have found some traces.GH: Now that’s a fair point. But it’s not a conclusive one. If we treat theGreat Bahama Bank as an Ice Age island, the archaeology that has been done on it– even if you thoroughly archaeologized every bit of land that’s above water,you’d still be only touching about 10 per cent or 15 per cent of the formerisland. So that means say, 90 per cent of the former island has never beenlooked at at all.Gifford: That’s true.GH: Don’t you think that’s a bit unparsimonious, to jump to conclusions withoutdoing the archaeology first?Gifford: Well, it, it’s … it’s just a fact of life in this case that no one andno organization is going to fund a prehistoric underwater archaeological surveyof the Bahamas …A LATE FLOODThis is the way with self-fulfilling prophecies. The scientific consensus thatthere is nothing particularly worth looking for underwater around the Bahamasinevitably affects research priorities and the result is that no seriousunderwater research gets done. Naturally, in consequence, nothing is found. Thisin turn reinforces the view that there is nothing worth looking for – and so onad infinitum.But coming at the problem from the point of view of inundation scienceintroduces the possibility of a different perspective – one that tends to excitecuriosity about the past. Rather than simply being underwater, inaccessible andunlikely to attract research funds, the inundation maps show that the Biminiarea once contained not just one but in fact three principal islands, as well asseveral smaller islands, that are likely to have enjoyed a favoured climateduring the Ice Age. The inundation map for 12,400 years ago shows, to the north,a crescent-shaped island around present-day Grand Bahama, Great Abaco and LittleAbaco. Clockwise to the south-east from there we come to a second lost island.This island fills in what is now Tarpum Bay under Eleuthera, then connects viathe thin but very probably unbroken line of the Exuma Cays to an even largerexposed area stretching almost as far south as Cuba – itself significantlylarger than it is today. Third, to the north-west in the direction of theFlorida peninsula covering present-day Andros island and occupying most of theGreat Bahama Bank, is the largest antediluvian island of all, with Bimini andthe Bimini Road right at its tip.The inundation map for 6900 years ago shows some coastal erosion of the threemain islands but otherwise the picture remains basically unchanged – indicatingthat the islands survived beyond the last of the three great episodes of globalpostglacial flooding around 7000 years ago. However, in the next inundation mapin the sequence, for 4800 years ago, all the islands have gone. The most likelyculprit for their inundation is the so-called Flandrian transgression, the finalspasm of the Ice Age meltdown, which took place between 6000 and 5000 years ago.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_158_r1.jpg]SPECULATION 1: THE CHART SHARED BY COLUMBUS AND PINZONTo the strictly limited extent that inundation science can accuratelyreconstruct former coastlines I find it interesting – nothing more than that –that the formidable antediluvian island of which Bimini formed a part untilabout 6000 years ago does bear a loose resemblance in size, shape and generalorientation, to the ‘mythical’ island of Antilia on the 1424 Pizzagano chart.Like Antilia on that chart, antediluvian Bimini even has a smaller island lyingto its west -occupying the position of the present-day Cay Sal Bank.Is it possible that the mysterious ‘book’ said to have inspired Columbus tocross the Atlantic by showing him that it had an end could have contained achart of the Atlantic Ocean of the kind proposed by Nordenskiold – a chartdating back to the mapmaking tradition of Marinus of Tyre? Other charts linkedto this tradition, such as the Cantino and Reinal maps of the Indian Ocean andthe numerous portolans featuring Hy-Brasil, contain memories or ‘ghosts’ of IceAge topography and coastlines. So perhaps the coast and islands that the ‘book’of Columbus was said to have portrayed on the western side of the Atlantic werealso shown as they looked before being inundated by rising sea-levels? If Biminion the original ‘Tyrian sea-fish’ source map had been depicted as it looked atalmost any time between 12,000 years ago and 6000 years ago, then it couldtheoretically have provided the model for the ‘mythical’ island of Antilia thatbegan to appear on portolan charts during the seventy years prior to Columbus’svoyages of discovery.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_159_r1.jpg]For whatever reason, we do know that Columbus had a special interest in Antilia.Cited earlier, he is on record with a comment that suggests he recognized aspecific Phoenician (in this case Carthaginian) heritage behind the appearanceof Antilia on fifteenth-century nautical charts:[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_160_r1.jpg]Aristotle in his book On Marvellous Things reports a story that someCarthaginian merchants sailed over the Ocean Sea to a very fertile island … thisisland some Portuguese showed me on their charts under the name Antilia.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn11]Indeed, prior to winning the Spanish sponsorship that financed his expedition tothe New World, it is reported that ‘Christopher Columbus was making himself anuisance at the Portuguese court with persistent requests for an expedition toenable him to verify the marking of Antilia’ on certain maps.12[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn12]We’ve already explored some of the issues raised by the alleged ‘book’ ofColumbus and the hints that it may have contained an ancient nautical chart ofthe Atlantic that also showed certain parts of the New World. The suspicion thata map had indeed fallen into Columbus’s hands is further strengthened by certainpassages from his own Journal of the first voyage – an abridged version ofwhich, edited by his friend the friar Bartolome de las Casas and often expressedin the third person, has come down to us.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn13]The Atlantic crossing began from the port of Gomera in the Canary islands on 6September 1492. Three weeks later Columbus and his three little caravels weredeep into the terrifying, unknown reaches of the Ocean Sea – where, supposedly,no man had ever gone before to make a map. It is strange, therefore, to read thefollowing entry:Tuesday 25 September 1492. The Admiral [Columbus, upon whom the King and Queenof Spain had bestowed the title ‘Admiral of the Ocean Sea’] spoke with MartinAlonso Pinzon [Columbus’s second-in-command], captain of the caravel Pinta,regarding a chart which the Admiral had sent to him three days before in which,it appears, he had certain islands marked down in that sea. Martin Alonso was ofthe opinion that they were in the neighbourhood of those islands, and theAdmiral replied that he thought so also but, as they had not found them, it mustbe due to the currents which had carried them to the NE … The Admiral calledupon him to return the chart and, when it had been sent back on a rope, theAdmiral with his pilot and sailors began to mark their position on it.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn14]In my opinion this entry leaves very little room for doubt that Columbus andPinzon did indeed possess a chart – or charts – showing some areas of the NewWorld and suggesting a route across the Atlantic Ocean that would take themdirectly to it. This might also explain why Columbus consistently and knowinglyunderestimated the distance travelled each day in the information that he gaveto his crew. He did so every day of the outbound voyage. Here are a few of therelevant entries from the Journal:Sunday 9 September 1492. Sailed nineteen leagues today – and decided to countless than the true number, that the crew might not be frightened if the voyageshould prove long.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn15]Monday 10 September. In that day and night sailed sixty leagues … Reckoned onlyforty-eight leagues, that the men might not be terrified if the voyage should belong.16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn16]Wednesday 26 September. Sailed day and night thirty-one leagues and reckoned tothe crew twenty-four.17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn17]Wednesday 10 October. Day and night made fifty-nine leagues progress to theWest-south-west; reckoned to the crew forty-four.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn18]Is it possible that Columbus adopted this practice of under-reporting the actualdistances travelled because he had, from the outset, a very good idea from hischart about how long the voyage was likely to be and knew that the men wouldnever have set out at all, and would want to turn back, if he had been morehonest with them?SPECULATION 2: THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COLUMBUSFor all the reasons outlined in previous chapters, let’s speculate that Columbusdid – somehow – come into possession of an old nautical chart showing the NewWorld, and that he was sufficiently convinced of its veracity to risk crossingthe Atlantic on the strength of it. Moreover, we’ve seen that Columbus promotedhis expedition to potential sponsors on the explicit grounds that he had a chartwhich showed the coast and islands at the end of the Western Sea. UnlessColumbus was completely mad, it follows that this chart must have possessed somequality (perhaps to do with the ‘book’ in which it was incorporated) that lefthim in no doubt that it was accurate. Certainly, it must have distinguisheditself in a significant and obvious way from any other maps or charts (forexample the Behaim globe – see overleaf) that would have been available toColumbus and already known by his sponsors in 1492. Let’s also speculate thatthis vitally important and convincing chart did not show the entire Atlanticcoast of the Americas but was a fragment featuring only the mainland and islandsbetween the Florida peninsula and Venezuela on the western side of the Atlantic(probably combined, with a typical portolan portrayal of the coasts of southernEurope and north Africa on the eastern side of the Atlantic).What mainland and what islands would Columbus have been most likely to havebelieved were shown awaiting discovery by anyone daring enough to cross theOcean Sea? Everything suggests that, far from a ‘New World’, what the Admiralactually expected to find at the end of his first crossing of the Atlantic wasthe remote and fabulous eastern extremity of the Old World – quite specificallyJapan and China as they had been described in Marco Polo’s Travels and othersources.This was not a zany, way-out idea on Columbus’s part but was the consensus viewof geographers, mariners and merchants of his day. All accepted that the earthwas a sphere and that it should be possible to sail round it in both directions.None knew of the existence of the Americas. All accepted, at leasttheoretically, that this meant Japan and China in the extreme east might befetched more quickly, safely and easily by sailing west across the Atlantic fromEurope, than by means of the arduous overland route that Marco Polo had taken tothe Court of the Great Khan in the thirteenth century …Such ideas were in wide circulation and had been expressed in clear visual formon maps and globes prepared before Columbus ever crossed the Atlantic. Theclassic example is the Behaim globe, completed at the beginning of 1492 -whichColumbus is known to have seen in the months before his first voyage.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn19] Redrawn here in plan form(overleaf) this globe by the geographer Martin Behaim (Martin of Bohemia) showsthe British Isles, Spain, North Africa and the Canary islands separated fromCipango (i.e., Japan), China, ‘Greater India’ and the Indonesian archipelago byan Ocean Sea about one-third wider than the Atlantic.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn20] In between there is no sign ofthe New World – of course, because Columbus would not discover it until later in1492 – but Behaim has installed for good measure some ‘mythical’ islands,including the island of Saint Brendan and also Antilia. It is noteworthy that herepresents the island which he labels Antilia as rather small and insignificant– nothing like the large and roughly rectangular landmass shown under the nameof Antilia on the 1424 chart. But, weirdly, a landmass with something of thetraditional rectangular, north-south shape of Antilia does appear much furtherwest on the Behaim globe – lying in the Ocean Sea off the Chinese mainland.Behaim has labelled it Cipango (Japan) and surrounded it with numerous smallerislands.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_161_r1.jpg]Coast outlines from Martin Behaim’s 1492 globe. Based on Fiske (1902).Other maps of the period that depict Cipango in the same Antilia-like mannerinclude the Yale-Martellus world map of 1489 and the Contarini-Rosselli worldmap of 1506.21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn21]What all have in common is an Ocean Sea far wider that any sailor of thefifteenth century would have dared to cross, Columbus included. All the morereason to suppose that the chart upon which he relied to make the crossing didindeed show the width of the Atlantic accurately – still a formidable enoughdistance to travel, but possible … possible.SPECULATION 3: TO ASIA WITH A MAP OF THE AMERICAS?I want to reinforce the point here that Columbus, in possession of ourhypothetically accurate but outdated ‘Tyrian sea-fish’ chart of certain parts ofthe eastern seaboard and islands of the Americas, could have used itsuccessfully to guide his little fleet of caravels to the New World while yetremaining absolutely convinced that the coast and islands he had reached wereparts of eastern Asia. Conditioned by Polo and Ptolemy, Columbus’s conception ofthe eastern extremity of Asia is likely to have been close or identical to thatshown on the Behaim globe. Sailing west, he would, in other words, have beenexpecting first to find Antilia, then the island of Cipango (set amongstnumerous other islands as Polo had indicated). And after Cipango he would haveexpected to arrive at the great curving peninsula of the Chinese province ofMangi, described by Marco Polo, with its fabulous capital of Zaitun.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_162_r1.jpg]Comparison of east coast of America with east coast of Asia.Meanwhile – please remember this is speculation – what Columbus and Pinzonactually had to guide them was an antediluvian chart not of the coast andislands of Japan and China but of the Americas and the Caribbean between Floridaand Venezuela. The chart showed pre-deluge Bimini (connected to Andros and theexposed Great Bahama Bank) as a large island with a shape and orientationroughly similar to that of Antilia on the 1424 Venetian portolan, but showing aneven closer resemblance to Cipango on the Behaim globe.We know from the inundation maps that antediluvian Bimini was also surrounded byother islands – as Columbus expected Cipango to be. Imposing his preconceptionson the chart, it is therefore quite possible that he mistook for Cipango whatwas in fact the cartographic ghost of antediluvian Bimini 6000 or more yearsago, and that he mistook the Central American mainland that lay beyond for theMangi peninsula.It is usually argued that Columbus’s dreamlike and almost hallucinatorymisunderstandings of the geography of the region he discovered arose out of hisdeep belief that he was sailing to Asia on the one hand and his actualexperiences in the New World on the other. But I suggest – again, speculationonly – that the real source of the dissonance between expectation and experiencewas that Columbus’s chart showed antediluvian features that had been longsubmerged by 1492 and that therefore could not be found no matter howfrantically he searched for them. Despite these ‘maladjustments’, however, theislands and mainland of the part of the New World he had arrived in matched upwell enough with his expectations of the islands and mainlands of Asia (see page539) for him to convince himself that he was indeed in Asia.Entries from the Journal of the first voyage make this extremely clear. Firstlandfall was made at San Salvador on 12 October 1492,22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn22] a point very close to the groupof large antediluvian islands that existed around Bimini down to 6000 years ago.If the chart that Columbus used to get his fleet across the Atlantic had shownthese ghost islands – the largest of which he believed to be Cipango – then hewould have been disappointed and disoriented when he failed to find any largeislands at all in the area. He might well have concluded that the chart on whichhe had placed so much reliance was after all inaccurate, or he might haveconcluded that he had failed to follow his course properly.The Journal suggests that Columbus believed his fleet could have been carriedtoo far to the north-east by currents on the transatlantic crossing.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn23] It is therefore of interest thaton leaving San Salvador he chose to sail a compensatory route south and west,through the characteristic tiny cays and sandbars that dot the seascape today,trying to pick up intelligence en route about the whereabouts of the largeisland of Cipango:Sunday 21 October 1492. I shall presently set sail for another very large islandwhich I believe to be Cipango according to the indications I receive from theIndians on board. They call the island Colba [Cuba]. [From there] I amdetermined to proceed on to the mainland, and visit the city of Guisay [Qinsai]and deliver the letters of Your Highnesses [Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain] tothe Great Khan, demand an answer and return with it.24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn24]Tuesday 23 October. It is now my intention to depart for the island of Cuba,which I believe to be Cipango from the indications these people give of its sizeand wealth, and will not delay any further here …25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn25]Wednesday 24 October. This must be the island of Cipango, of which we have heardso many wonderful things. According to the globes and maps of the world I haveseen, it must be somewhere in this neighbourhood.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn26]Columbus did not complete the exploration of Cuba on his first voyage, and onhis second voyage he changed his mind about its identification with Cipango anddecided that it was part of the mainland of south-eastern China instead. Thiswas because islanders told him that ‘Cuba had no end to the westward’, andreferred him for further particulars to ‘the people of Mangon, a provincetowards the west’.27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn27] As CharlesDuff explains:The name Mangon inflamed the imagination of Columbus, who immediately identifiedit with the Mangi of Marco Polo, the southern province of China, ‘the mostmagnificent and the richest province that was known in the eastern world,’according to Polo.28 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn28][Columbus] was now – as it happened – within two or three days sail of thewestern end of Cuba, the discovery of which would have disillusioned himconcerning its connexion with the mainland of Asia. As it was, he turned backfirmly convinced that Cuba was the eastern extremity of the Asiatic continent.And in that belief every person on board expressed his concurrence by a solemnsigned deposition. Columbus never afterward abandoned his conviction – heremained unshaken to the end of his life. The dream or fantasy was to him areality …29 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn29]Despite the constant stream of new discoveries and rapidly improving maps thatfollowed the voyages of Columbus, the dream remained a reality for many othersas well. Thus, an inscription placed next to the coast of Asia on theContarini-Rosselli world map of 1506 informs us that ‘Columbus sailed westwardto the province of Ciamba, the region of China opposite Cipango.’30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn30]Last but not least, improbable though it may seem, it is known that Columbusfinally decided that the island of Hispaniola was the Cipango of his dreams.31[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn31]As noted earlier, Gregory Mcintosh has presented a compelling case that a copyof an original map drawn by Christopher Columbus in which Cuba is represented aspart of the Central American mainland is incorporated into the world-famous PiriReis map of 1513. It is therefore intriguing to note – on exactly that sectionof Piri’s map that was derived from Columbus – that a large ‘ghost’ island withapproximately the same shape, dimensions and north-south orientation asantediluvian Bimini is prominently depicted. What seems to seal theidentification with antediluvian Bimini – as the reader may confirm at a glancefrom the zoomed window overleaf – is that this ghost island is clearly markedwith a row of huge stone slabs laid out in a manner that strongly resembles thelayout and appearance of the slabs in the now-submerged Bimini Road. Mcintoshdoes not comment on this peculiar megalithic image on the 1513 map; however, hedoes believe that he can explain the presence there of the non-existent islanditself without any recourse to ghosts from before the flood.It’s all terribly simple, he argues. This large north-south oriented islandcannot be found today because it is just the result of a dishonest – or at anyrate self-deluding – representation by Columbus of the island of Hispaniola tomake it look more like the island of Cipango that he had convinced himself itwas.32 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn32]Now a glance at any modern atlas will show that Hispaniola (today dividedbetween Haiti and the Dominican Republic) has an east-west rather thannorth-south orientation and that an island of roughly the right size, in roughlythe right place and with roughly the right east-west orientation to beHispaniola does actually appear on the Piri Reis map. However, Mcintosh ignoresthat option and reminds us (correctly) that Columbus shared the generalconception shown on the Behaim globe, etc., of Cipango as an island with a north– south orientation.33 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn33] So weddedwas the great explorer to that idea, alleges Mcintosh, that in maps made on hissecond voyage (one of which Piri Reis copied) he simply flipped Hispaniola 90degrees so that it now lay north-south -with the end-result that: ‘The shape andorientation of Hispaniola on the Piri Reis map is strikingly similar to that ofCipango shown on maps of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.’34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn34][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_163_r1.jpg]Piri Reis’s ghost island in the Caribbean.‘It is difficult to accept the fact,’ adds Mcintosh:[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_164_r1.jpg]Exposed Great Bahama Bank, 6900 years ago.that Columbus, perhaps the greatest navigator of his time, would contort theorientations of Cuba and Hispaniola as much as 90 degrees out of place … [Yet]for Columbus in 1495–96, when the map was made that Piri Reis was later to use,to have turned Hispaniola 90 degrees to its correct position was to admit it wasnot Cipango and that his ‘Enterprise of the Indies’ was a failure.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn35]This is actually a moot point and Mcintosh passes over it too quickly. Columbusmay well have shared the general preconception, apparently based on nothing morethan vague reports of Marco Polo, that Cipango was a north-south-orientedisland, but he was a practical man as well as a dreamer, and a good navigator byall accounts. I do not think he would have persisted in the notion that Cipangowas oriented north-south if the island that he believed to be Cipango turnedout, in practice, to be oriented east-west. Either he would have decided that hehad not yet found Cipango, or that the old travellers’ tales about Cipango beingoriented north-south had been wrong and that his own scientifically measuredeast-west alignment for the island should be substituted on future maps.Hispaniola was discovered by Columbus on his first voyage, when he named it notCipango but ‘La Isla Espanola’ – ‘The Spanish Island’. Mcintosh’s identificationof Hispaniola with the strange north-south island on Piri’s map is thereforestrengthened by the fact that Piri labels it, literally, ‘The Island Named TheSpanish Island’. Additional support comes from a place-name on the island-Paksin vidad. ‘This name,’ says Mcintosh, ‘is undoubtedly Navidad, the name ofthe first settlement founded in the New World on the north coast ofHispaniola.’36 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn36]The peculiarly ambiguous identification of Hispaniola with Cipango that Mcintoshbelieves Columbus was anxious to make filtered through to others and survivedlong after it was known that Hispaniola was definitely not Cipango. Thus, in alegend on the Ruysch map of 1507 we read that ‘what the Spanish have namedHispaniola is also Cipango’.37 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn37]Likewise, Ononteus Finnaeus, in his world map of 1534, labelled Hispaniola asCipango.38 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn38]The picture is then further complicated by other sources in which we findHispaniola being identified not with Japan but with Antilia – for example inletters from the explorer Amerigo Vespucci published in 1506.39[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn39] And this, in turn, may wellrelate to what was apparently a widely held opinion after Columbus’s firstvoyage, particularly amongst the Portuguese, that ‘the islands he had discoveredwere the islands of the legendary Antilia and not the coast of Asia’.40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn40] Indeed, this is the reason whythe Caribbean islands on modern maps are still called the Antilles today.41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn41]Amidst such cartographic confusion over place-names and attributions I thinkthere is room to respect the quality of the theory that Mcintosh has put forwardwhile remembering that it is only a theory and that there are other possibleexplanations of the island thought to represent Hispaniola/Cipango on the PiriReis map. It is possible, for example, that the place-names on the island whichso strengthen its identification with Hispaniola (‘The Island Called The SpanishIsland’ and ‘Paksin vidad’) were not present on the Columbian original but wereput there speculatively by Piri Reis himself.In view of correlations with Ice Age topography identified on other maps of theperiod, and of the special importance given to the anachronistic map showing theend of the Western Sea that the Admiral was said to have possessed beforediscovering the Americas, I remain open to the possibility that all along whatColumbus thought of as representations of Cipango and its surrounding islands onhis mysterious chart could have been ghosts of the antediluvian islands of theGreat Bahama Bank.Taken to the limit, this line of reasoning might even suggest that the model forearly cartographic representations of Cipango (conceived of as an island thatcould be reached by sailing west from Europe) was not provided by vaguetravellers’ reports sent back across the breadth of Asia as has hitherto beensupposed, but was in fact derived from the representation on ‘Tyrian sea-fish’maps (one of which had fallen into the hands of Columbus) of the largeantediluvian island of Bimini.But if the ghost of antediluvian Bimini did provide the model for earlyrepresentations of Cipango, then, logically, it could not also have doubled upas the model for the legendary island of Antilia (which often appears on thesame maps as Cipango).Is there a model for Antilia?THAT THING BETWEEN COLUMBUS AND PINZON AGAIN …We’ve seen evidence, both from the inscriptions of Piri Reis and from theJournal of the first voyage, that Columbus possessed a chart of the Atlantic-and that it was considered so important as a guide to the crossing that it waspassed back and forth between Columbus in his flagship the Santa Maria and hissecond-in-command Martin Alonso Pinzon, captain of the Pinta. The presence andexact character of this chart seem enigmatic when we remember the intensivedemand for it from the two captains (who shared it but apparently did notpossess individual copies), its obvious practical utility to them throughout thevoyage, and the fact that it got them to the New World. Such a useful chart ofthe Atlantic cannot be explained against the background of the cartographicknowledge of the time. On the contrary the part that it played in the success ofthe Columbian voyages must be weighed up against the background of the abysmalignorance of even the greatest mapmakers in Europe of the true circumstances ofan Atlantic crossing and of the real appearance of the coast and islands on thewestern side. To have followed the speculative vision of Behaim in his famousglobe, or of others like him,42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn42]would have been disastrous, even though their work represents the cream offifteenth-century mapmaking and was known to Columbus. Indeed, as onecommentator has observed, if his chart had been based on the Behaim scenario,‘Columbus could not even have known of the whereabouts of the New World, muchless discover it.’43 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn43]Yet not only does he seem to have known where he was going but, on someaccounts, when he was going to get there:Now and then Pinzon and Columbus consult and deliberate – mutually discuss theirroute. The map or chart passes not infrequently from the one captain to theother; the observations and calculations as to their position are dailyrecorded, their conduct and course for the night duly agreed upon.On the eve of their due arrival Columbus issues the order to stay the course ofthe armada, to shorten sail, because he knew that he was close to the New Worldand was afraid of going ashore during the obscurity of the night …How does he know the place and the hour?‘His Genius’ says the Columbus legend in explanation. But the Map? The criticswill ask, what did it contain? Whose was it? What did that map contain that wasso frequently passed from Columbus to Pinzon during the voyage?44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn44]I’ve presented my case that what the map may have contained was an accurate butancient, and indeed antediluvian, representation of the coast and islands ofCentral America, notably the north-south-oriented Great Bahama Bank island,which Columbus – no less ignorant than any of his contemporaries about theexistence of the Americas – took to be an accurate map of part of the coast ofChina and the islands of Japan.An interesting sidelight on this story concerns Pinzon himself. In 1515, nineyears after Columbus had died, the Pinzon family brought a lawsuit against theAdmiral’s estate on account of promises of benefit-sharing that he was said notto have kept. During this lawsuit it emerged that Pinzon too claimed to have hadprior information of the route to the New World:Arias Perez Pinzon, the son of Martin Alonso testified that his father haddefinite indications concerning the Lands to the West, which indications he hadfound in documents in the library of Pope Innocent VIII. The witness said thathe saw given to his father a document which contained the necessary informationfor the discovery. His father took it and carried it away with him, and upon hisreturn to Castile from Rome he decided to set out to discover the said lands,and often talked with the witness about the voyage. Meanwhile the Admiralarrived … with a plan to discover the same lands. The father of the witness,hearing of it, went to see this Christopher Columbus and told him that his planwas a good one, that he was sure of it, and that if the Admiral had delayed alittle longer he would have found Martin Pinzon already started with twocaravels to make the discovery himself. The Admiral, knowing that, put himselfon intimate terms with the father of the witness and brought about an agreementwhereby the said Martin Pinzon was engaged to accompany him.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn45]It is not obvious from the proceedings exactly what Pinzon found in the PapalLibrary in Rome or how it set forth ‘the necessary information for thediscovery’, but Gregory Mcintosh argues that it must have been ‘an old document(a manuscript book or portolan chart?) that told of a mythical expedition thatsailed west to Cipango …’46 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn46]Cipango again. And here are the words that Pinzon is reported to have used torecruit crews for Columbus’s ships:Friends, come, come with us on this voyage! Here you’re creeping about inpoverty; come and sail with us! For with God’s help we’re going to discover aland that they say has houses roofed with gold.47[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn47]Houses roofed with gold are diagnostic of the fabulous island of Cipangodescribed in Marco Polo’s Travels.48[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn48] It is therefore clear thatwhatever posthumous disagreements may have occurred over their relative roles inthe discovery, Pinzon and Columbus had been absolutely of one mind from the verybeginning that Cipango was to be their first destination and that the old chartsor documents that they possessed showed the way there. They were not to knowthat their ‘Cipango’ was the outline of a ghost island amidst a ghostarchipelago drowned 6000 years previously or that the mainland it lay off wasnot the end of the old world but the beginning of a new one.The previous sentence, of course, is pure speculation on my part – just ahypothesis launched to provoke inquiry into neglected possibilities. And itstill leaves the problem of Antilia unresolved.PROFESSOR FUSON’S LATERAL THINKING ABOUT ANTILIA AND SATANAZEThe identity, location, size and orientation of the ‘mythical’ island of Antiliaunderwent continuous bewildering changes on all kinds of maps and charts over aperiod of hundreds of years. There is, however, a definite beginning to thisenergetic metamorphosis and that is marked by the 1424 Venetian portolan onwhich Antilia first appears – presumably in its purest, least-changed form. Onthat chart, a smaller island is also shown lying to the west of Antilia. And itis important to remember that a second large ‘mythical’ island, Satanaze, isshown lying to the north-east of Antilia, again with a much smaller island(named Saya) near by, this time to the north.The identification of the two larger islands by Professor Robert H. Fuson of theUniversity of South Florida – in his 1995 book Legendary Islands of the OceanSea49 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn49] – is, in my opinion, amasterpiece of historical detective work. And it illustrates, better than anyother example I know, how the ghosts of islands can migrate not only throughtime but also through space, and sometimes through both dimensionssimultaneously.What Fuson has demonstrated, conclusively I think, is that Antilia and Satanaze,marooned in mid-Atlantic on the 1424 Venetian chart, are in fact the earliesttrue maps to appear in the West of the Pacific islands of Taiwan and Japan. Hisargument in brief is that the mapmaker Pizzagano had somehow come intopossession of Chinese nautical charts of Taiwan and Japan and – being asignorant as Columbus and others of the existence of the Americas – had placedthese islands in the Mid-Atlantic with the assumption that the mainland of Chinalay somewhere beyond.WHY ANTILIA IS TAIWANFuson begins provocatively:A number of large, Asiatic islands were charted by the Chinese during the activemaritime period of the first two decades of the 15th century. One of theseislands, Antilia, is known today as Taiwan.50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn50]As was said in many of the legends about Antilia, Fuson points out that Taiwanhas gold-bearing sands.51 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn51]Moreover,Taiwan also has something else that Antilia must have, and that is a smallisland to the west. On the 1424 Pizzagano chart it was called Ymana. Today it isthe Peng-Hu group, or Pescadores (Islands of the Fishermen). There are 64islands totalling 50 square miles.52[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn52]Some quotations from Fuson gave a taste of the quality of his proofs and thestrengths of his arguments: * Antilia on the 1424 nautical chart is about the right size and its shape articulates well with modern Taiwan. * Every one of the eight or nine river mouths of Antilia matches one of the principal river mouths of Taiwan. * The five largest rivers are correctly placed on the 1424 map of Antilia. Of Taiwan’s ten major rivers, seven are indicated on the map of Antilia and in approximately the correct locations. * Every significant coastal feature is plotted: embayments, capes and peninsulas. Antilia and Taiwan also share a unique north-eastern coastline. There the tip of the island terminates in a sharp, narrow cape. To the north-west the coastline is smooth and rounded.53 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn53]WHY SATANAZE IS JAPANFuson’s case for Japan is equally well made and again I will give the gist of itbriefly and in his own words: * North of Antilia on the 1424 chart are two islands: Satanaze and Saya. Without question these are the Japanese islands. Saya … the Japanese word for ‘bean pod’ … is Hokkaido, while the three main islands (Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu) are represented by the single island of Satanaze. The channel between Kyushu and Shikoku/Honshu is well defined. * The origin of the name Satanaze is easy to understand … The southern tip of Kyushu is Cape Sata (Sata-Misaki). Approximately 300 kilometres to the south, in the northern Ryukyu islands, is the city of Naze. * The most important bays in Japan are depicted on the Satanaze/Saya chart … and two of them merit special notice. The entrance to the Inland Sea at Bungo Strait is the largest oceanic indentation (as it should be) and Tokyo Bay is guarded by the volcanic island O Shima, one of the most prominent harbour landmarks on earth. From a mariner’s perspective it is quite appropriate to exaggerate a feature such as O Shima. * Saya [Hokkaido], which was not even mapped by the fifteenth-century Japanese, was depicted in its bean-pod shape for more than 300 years. Its 1424 rendering by the Venetians reveals all the important features along the south coast and is every bit as detailed as Portuguese examples in the seventeenth century.54 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn54]After first appearing on the 1424 chart, notes Fuson, the Antilia group ofislands found their way onto at least seventeen other charts and one globe (theBehaim globe):Nomenclature was chaotic and occasionally one or another island was omitted.Antilia was mapped as an island in the Ocean Sea until at least 1508 (the Ruyschmap), but Japan had captured its form in 1492 on the Behaim globe … The oldAntilia/Taiwan shape continued to appear in what had become the Pacific Oceanand in 1546 (Munster map, Basel) carried the label ‘Zipangu’. A major problemhad arisen as the shapes and locations of Antilia/Taiwan [and] Satanaze/Cipango… became entangled … When the West Indies became the Antilles in the middle ofthe sixteenth century, Antilia-the-island was no longer needed. The originalisland was relegated to mythological status and Japan was free to use its body.By 1570 the magnificent atlas Theatrum orbis terrarum (by Abraham Ortelius)placed Japan in its proper location and labelled it ‘Iapan’ (Japan).55[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn55]GHOSTS OF A DROWNED WORLDIt is Professor Fuson’s view that Chinese charts of Taiwan and Japan were thesource of the 1424 portrayal of Antilia and Satanaze. He makes a very persuasivecase that such charts are likely to have originated from the seven spectacularvoyages of discovery made by the famous Ming admiral Cheng Ho between 1405 and1433.56 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn56]Cheng Ho was a giant of a man, ‘seven feet tall with a waist of 60 inches’,57[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c24-ftn57] and is worth a giant of a storyin his own right – though unfortunately this is not the place to tell it. Muchsuggests, however, that Robert Fuson is correct to deduce that the charts ofTaiwan and Japan that somehow found their way into the hands of Zuane Pizzaganoin Venice in 1424 must have originated from the voyages of Cheng Ho.Yet there is a problem. As we will see, Antilia and Satanaze on the 1424 chartdon’t show Taiwan and Japan as they looked in the time of Cheng Ho, but ratheras they looked approximately 12,500 years ago during the meltdown of the IceAge.Is it possible that Cheng Ho, too, like Columbus, was guided in his voyages byancient maps and charts, come down from another time and populated by the ghostsof a drowned world?"},{"pageContent":"PART SIXJAPAN, TAIWAN, CHINA"},{"pageContent":"25 / THE LAND BELOVED OF THE GODSAs a tradition which began in the High Heavenly Plain,I humbly speak before the sovereign DeitiesWho dwell massively imbedded like sacred massed rocksIn the myriad great thoroughfares …Ancient Japanese ritual prayer1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn1] The highest peak of Mount Fuji … is a wondrous deity … and a guardian of theland of Japan.The Man’ yoshu2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn2]The identification of the ‘legendary’ Atlantic islands of Antilia and Satanazewith Taiwan and Japan is the hypothesis of Professor Robert Fuson, and isdelivered as the punchline to his utterly convincing book Legendary Islands ofthe Ocean Sea.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn3] He furthersuggests that the source-map from which the outlines of Antilia and Satanazewere derived must have come from China and would most probably have been drawnup during the voyages of the great Chinese admiral Cheng Ho.What Fuson does not notice – there is no reason why he should – is that Antiliaand Satanaze on the 1424 Venetian chart do not portray Taiwan and Japan as theylooked in the early fifteenth century, the epoch of Cheng Ho’s voyages, but asthey looked around 12,500 years ago during the meltdown of the Ice Age. Onewould have to go back to around that date, for example, to find the three mainJapanese islands – Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu – joined together into one largerisland, as is the case with Satanaze. I will substantiate this statement andpursue this mystery to its conclusion in due course.Meanwhile, by a strange, roundabout route I had found my way back to Japan,encountering it where I had least expected it – in the middle of the AtlanticOcean. Long before I learned that it had been shown in its Ice Age configurationon a 1424 chart, however, I was already acutely aware of another Japanesemystery centred on the end of the Ice Age when rapidly rising sea-levelsinundated a series of massive rock-hewn structures around the coasts of theRyukyu archipelago of southern Japan.I’ve outlined some of the background to this in chapter 1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01] – how I first heard of Japan’sunderwater ruins in 1996 and how the generosity of an extraordinary Japaneseentrepreneur enabled me to explore all the main sites between 1997 and 2001. Imade close to 130 dives at Yonaguni with logistical assistance from Seamen’sClub, Ishigaki, and with the best and most knowledgeable local teams led by menlik e Kihachiro Aratake and Yohachiro Yoshimaru. Then there were around eighteendives at Kerama (on five different visits there) again in the company of greatlocal specialists lik e Kuzanori Kawai, Mitsutoshi Taniguchi, Isamu Tsukaharaand Kiyoshi Nagaki. I successfully dived twice at Aguni, i n a most forbidding,inaccessible and difficult spot, and around a dozen times at Chatan off the westcoast of Okinawa – once again, in both places, with exceptional local support.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_165_r1.jpg]In chapter 1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01], where I briefly describethe four main Japanese underwater sites, I also suggest that the solution to themystery of these places – and to the interminable wrangle about whether they arenatural or man-made – cannot be arrived at purely by a consensus of geologists.This is not only because there is, in fact, no consensus of geologists on thecharacter of these structures (on the contrary, opinions are polarized) but alsobecause geological opinion alone is not adequate to settle the matter. One neednot be a specialist in anything to see that Japan has cultivated a uniquesensitivity to the beauty that is immanent in natural forms and to realize thatsuch a refined intimacy with rock and mountain, forest and valley is likely tohave extremely ancient roots. Sculpting in rock and the placing of sculptedrocks in artistically manipulated landscapes remains a distinguishing Japanesepassion – and an intensely spiritual one – to this day. It therefore makessense, in pursuit of reasoned conclusions about the underwater rock structuresof Japan, to take into account not only geological considerations but also whatis known about the character, the level of development and the artistic andreligious culture of the ancient Japanese at the end of the Ice Age when thoserock structures (whether natural or man-made) were not yet submerged.PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE JOMONAt first glance I could see nothing encouraging about prehistoric Japan. Theconsensus view for the past half century has been that during the period from17,000 years ago (roughly the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the beginningof the global meltdown) down to about 2000 years ago the islands were populatedexclusively by a culture of hunter-gatherers, the Jomon, who were in mostrespects extremely primitive.The ‘Stone Age’ image of the Jomon put me off the idea of researching them. Howcould so backward a people, who supposedly never discovered agriculture, haveanything to tell me, one way or another, about my central interest – thepossibility of a great lost civilization of antiquity? Small tribal bandswandering from place to place, grubbing around in the mud for nuts and berries,spearing the odd fish or mammal, did not fit with my idea of what I was lookingfor.Nevertheless, I knew that I could not afford to discount the Jomon entirely -ifonly because their culture seems to have emerged very suddenly in Japan around16,500 years ago, at which remote date it is attested to by fragments of theoldest known pottery in the world. The pottery itself at such an early date ishighly anomalous. And whatever the end of the Ice Age really meant – then andfor thousands of years afterwards – the Jomon witnessed it, went through it,were part of it, and triumphantly survived it down almost to historical times. Istill felt a definite reluctance but I realized that sooner or later I was goingto have to learn more about this prehistoric people whose story was veiled bythe mists of the past.THE PREHISTORIC CITY AND THE MAN-MADE MOUNTAINIn 1998, on the suggestion of Japanese friends, I visited the Jomon site ofSannai-Muryama in Aomori Prefecture, and was surprised to discover how large andhow well-organized the ancient settlement had been at its peak 4500 years ago –the same epoch exactly as ancient Egypt’s ‘pyramid age’. Sannai-Muryama, withits spacious public buildings, wide streets and planned sanitation, was not atall what I had expected of primitive hunter-gatherers. These were the obvioussigns of permanent settlement, stability, order, organization and economicsuccess. And they were accompanied by equally clear indications of a societywith evolved spiritual ideas. In particular, the use of grave goods by theancient inhabitants, and of symbolic burial patterns, are suggestive of complexbeliefs in the afterlife of the soul. A ceremonial pathway that dominates thesite proved, on excavation, to be lined on each side by tombs with the feet ofthe dead pointing towards the path and their heads away from it.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_166_r1.jpg]On the same trip I learned that certain pyramid-shaped mounds, hills andmountains are regarded as sacred beings in Japanese mythology and saw evidencewhich suggests not only that this belief is rooted deep in Jomon times but alsothat it sometimes led the Jomon into ‘artistic manipulation’ of the landscape onan even larger scale than the disputed structures now underwater at Yonaguni,Chatan and Kerama.In Akita Prefecture, for example, two hours’ drive from Aomori, I climbed thecedar-covered slopes of an 80 metre high mound which juts emphatically out ofthe surrounding plains. Its name is Kuromata Yama (Mount Kuromata) and accordingto local legend it is ‘a pyramid built by an ancient people’.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn4] Geologists remained scepticaluntil a multi-disciplinary team of scientists from the Japan-Pacific Rim StudiesAssociation led by Professor Takashi Kato of Tohoku Gakuin University produceddetailed radar maps of Kuromata Yama in the 1990s. The maps show that theinterior of the moundconsists of seven terraces with stones laid out on each terrace. This is a clearindication that it was shaped by man and is certainly very different from anatural mountain formed by volcanic eruptions or natural weathering.5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn5]The experts concluded that a natural hill had indeed once stood on the site butthat this had been deliberately quarried, sculpted and reinforced with stoneblocks to create a pyramidial core with seven terraces that was finally coveredwith ramped earth and then overgrown by vegetation. Thus, ‘Although the mountainis not a pyramid in the Egyptian sense, it was nevertheless made into the shapeof one for religious purposes.’6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn6]Since work of such ambition and scale has never previously been associated withthe Jomon, it was at first assumed that the construction work was unlikely to bevery old – perhaps no older than the eleventh century AD. The Motomiya Shrine ofJapan’s indigenous Shinto religion that stands on its summit seems to be linkedto that epoch, since it is named after a physician who served Sadato Abe (AD1019–1062), a local ruler of north-east Honshu.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn7] On the other hand, since Shintoshrines are completely rebuilt according to a pre-existing pattern every twentyyears on sites that in most cases have been sacred ever since records began,this perhaps proves less than it should. At any rate, the excavations byarchaeologists on Professor Kato’s team settled the matter with the discovery offragments of Jomon pottery in the mound and other archaeological evidence whichconfirmed beyond serious dispute that Kuromata Yama had indeed been landscapedinto its pyramidal form ‘in the Jomon era’.8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn8]Equally important was another discovery published a year earlier by team-memberMasachika Tsuji of Doshisha University in Kyoto. He showed that four Shintoshrines positioned around the base of Kuromata Yama lie in direct lines pointingnorth, south, east and west from the summit and incorporate solstitialalignments datable through the accepted formula for changes in the obliquity ofthe ecliptic to 4000 years ago: ‘The shrines were built relatively recently onwhat are known to be sacred sites dating from ancient times, suggesting theshrines may have maintained that link since the Jomon Period.’9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn9]Surviving ancient texts enable us to trace the recorded story of Shinto back atthe most about 2500 years and realistically probably less than 2000 years;however, at that stage it seems already to have been fully formed. Allauthorities therefore agree, though lost in prehistory, that Shinto’s originsmust be much older than 2000 years. As far as I know, however, the discoveriesat Kuromata Yama are the first to demonstrate such a clear relationship betweenthe religious architecture of the prehistoric Jomon and the Shinto religion asit survives and expresses itself to this day – a religion, it is worthreiterating, that is unique to Japan and that is of unknown age and origin.Perhaps the clearest sign of a family relationship to emerge from theexcavations is that the Motomiya Shrine shares the summit of Kuromata Yama withthe remains of a previously unknown stone circle constructed by the Jomon.Kuromata Yama is also clearly visible from two further Jomon stone circles thathave been excavated at Oyu, 2.2 kilometres to the south-west. Both of these aremore oval than circular, one about 35 metres in diameter, the other 20 metres indiameter. Both are about 4000 years old, a little younger than Britain’sStonehenge. By European ‘megalithic’ standards they are not large and the stonesactually used in their construction are puny when compared with Stonehenge orCarnac. Still, they are ‘stone circles’ in every meaningful sense of the term.THE MYSTERY OF THE POTSNor were these the only surprises that the Jomon had in store for me. As we’vealready noted, what is truly outstanding and unexplained about these ‘primitivehunter-gatherers’ is that they were the first people in the world to inventpottery – one of the great leaps forward in human culture which, in their case,took place not just hundreds but thousands of years before anybody else. Asrecently as 1998 most scholars believed that the oldest Jomon pottery was madeabout 12,500 years ago – itself a staggeringly early date – but so rapid is thepace of new discovery in this field that that the origins of Jomon civilizationhave had to be continuously revised backwards.In May 2000, on my second visit to the Aomori area, I held in the palm of myhand four fragments of a broken Jomon pot 16,500 years old. Excavated at a siteknown as Odayamamaoto No. 1 Iseki, the potsherds had been dated usingstate-of-the-art AMS technology.It is still a little-known fact that the Jomon of Japan are the world’s oldestpottery-making culture. But even less well known is the extent to which thisprehistoric people maintained a distinct identity as a single, homogeneousgroup. According to Dr Yasuhiro Okada, the Aomori Prefecture’s ChiefArchaeologist at Sannai-Muryama, ‘they were one culture, from beginning to end’.Imagine that – one culture, probably one language, probably one religion,staying intact for more than 14,000 years. That’s the time-span between theoldest Jomon pottery – 16,500 years old – and the youngest examples – which areabout 2000 years old.GENIUS OR INFLUENCE?What happened to the Jomon? If their culture could survive for 14,000 years, howcome they aren’t still with us today?The archaeological record points to the influx into Japan – probably from Koreaand probably between 2700 and 2300 years ago – of a larger, more populous andmore economically competitive group of people. Named the ‘Yayoi’ by modernscholars (we do not know what they called themselves), these were sophisticated,highly organized rice-growers and it is generally supposed that their way oflife simply overwhelmed that of the indigenous hunter-gatherers. Although theYayoi were a martial culture and the Jomon were not, there is no evidence ofmilitary conflict or of genocide. The Jomon were not ‘wiped out’. If anything,the latest archaeology prompts us to envisage something more like an effortlessmerging and mixing of peoples into the new synthesis that would cross fromprehistory into history – from forgotten time into remembered time – in thealready complete form of classical Japanese civilization. In a sense, therefore,Jomon culture is still with us and may never have come to an end.Does it have a beginning? The archaeological record is constantly subject torevision by new evidence. But to the extent that the Jomon are defined by andidentified with their pottery-making skills, then the earliest definite evidencefor their existence that has so far been discovered consists of that littlegroup of pottery fragments from 16,500 years ago.Did something happen in Japan at that time that could explain why the Jomoninvented pottery millennia before anybody else? Shimoyamu Satoru of the IbusukiArchaeological Museum on Kyushu island suggests: ‘maybe there was just a Jomongenius who figured it out – you know, clay, open fire, pot. He saw thepotential.’ On the other hand, Professor Sahara Makoto, Director-General of theNational Museum of Japanese History, believes that ‘there must have been someinfluence’. Sitting cross-legged on the floor of his office, he drew up a map ofJapan, China and Siberia. ‘Here in Japan’, he explained, ‘we have high levels ofdevelopment – new roads, new houses, even new cities are constantly being built.This means that the soil must be broken and turned over – and every time thishappens there is the possibility of archaeological discovery. But in China suchactivity is much less and in Siberia less still. So it is possible in Siberia,for example, that archaeologists might one day find the traces of an evenearlier pot-making culture that influenced the Jomon.’TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERWhat neither scholar appears to take into account is the peculiar coincidence indates between the earliest Jomon pottery, about 16,500 years ago, and the end ofthe Last Glacial Maximum, about 17,000 years ago – which was followed bythousands of years of ice-sheet meltdown and by global sea-level rises. Is thisjust a coincidence or could there be some weird causative link between thepost-glacial floods and the pottery?Sahara Makoto has already expressed his views on the subject of influence. Hethinks the Jomon were influenced by an earlier, probably Siberian, pot-makingculture. But to be fair, that is just his guess. It is undoubtedly correct thatpottery was being made at a very ancient date in Siberia10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn10] (though not as ancient as theoldest Jomon); however, the idea of pottery, the essential mental work to makethe great leap forward, does not require contact with a hypothetical mainlandtribe – and what counts against this hypothesis is the palaeogeologicalevidence. As the archaeologist Douglas Kenrick points out, ‘When the earliestrecorded pottery was made, the sea had engulfed any landbridges that might haveremained and had created a natural barrier between Japan and the mainland.’11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn11]In other words, if the Jomon were ‘influenced’ 16,500 years ago – to becomepotters and whatever else – then that influence is more likely to have enteredJapan by sea than by land. It could, theoretically, have been passed on by asingle survivor, or a handful of survivors, of a shipwreck. And since those weretimes of global floods the possibility cannot be ruled out that such a shipcould have come to Japan from very far away – could, theoretically, have beenblown in from almost anywhere. But whether the mariners marooned in Japan wereSiberian tribesmen or highly sophisticated survivors of a hypothetical lostcivilization it is unlikely that they would have been able to pass on more thana handful of useful ‘civilized’ skills to the primitive local inhabitants.It goes without saying that the skill of pottery would always be ranked near thetop of the list in any such emergency technology transfer.TIME AND SPACEWhatever the source of the original inspiration, there is no doubt that Jomonpottery is very distinctive. Its most characteristic decoration is the cord-mark(indeed, Jomon means ‘cord-mark’ in Japanese and is another name given byarchaeologists; as with the ‘Yayoi’ we do not know what the ‘Jomon’ calledthemselves). This decorative technique requires the potter to press lengths ofknotted twine down into the clay before firing and sometimes to roll the cordsto produce additional effects. The range of possible combinations is large andthese ‘cord-marks’ in their turn are only a tiny part of the full Jomonrepertoire of extravagant and unusual designs.This repertoire, it is worth remembering, exists in four dimensions – in time aswell as in space. I say this because on the one hand Jomon pottery is scatteredgeographically throughout Japan, from the far south, including the Ryukyuarchipelago, to the far north, including Hokkaido, and on the other is spreadout in time, connecting the world of relatively recent and comprehensiblehistory (2000 years ago) with the world of remote prehistory, 16,500 years ago,when the Ice Age went into meltdown.GENIE IN THE BOTTLEArchaeologists in Japan are more accommodating than their Western counterparts.Whereas most of the latter would rather be mummified than have me in theirmuseums, the Japanese are much less snobbish and judgemental. In Japan I haveagain and again been given the incredible privilege of handling very ancientartefacts – national treasures that in some cases are more than 12,000 yearsold. At the Sato Haramachi Archaeological Centre near the city of Miyazaki thisprivilege extended to holding in my hands the oldest piece of painted potteryever found in the world – part of a fine Jomon pot, painted red on the inside,securely dated to 11,500 years ago.To touch it was like boarding an express elevator on the way down to the depthsof time. I could almost see the ancient artist at work on the same object thatnow rested in my hands. In a peculiar way, I realized, he – or she – was stillalive in this potsherd, like a genie in a bottle. For a moment the 11,500 yearsthat separated us – more than twice the age of the Great Pyramid of Egypt-seemed a small matter.‘It requires imagination,’ says Douglas Kenrick, ‘to comprehend the length andvitality of the Jomon pottery age. Age leaves its mark on vessels buried for solong, but a feeling of awe at the age of a vessel should not blind us to itsbeauty.’In my travels in Japan I have seen a great deal of beautiful Jomon pottery ofall epochs. Made without recourse to the potter’s wheel, and always in openfires, it takes on a fantastic variety of forms – from the spectacular ‘flamepottery’ of 5000 years ago, with its grotesque and elaborate rim-work, toaustere and simple rounded bowls, more than 12,000 years old that are decoratedonly with cross-hatch or shell-scrape patterns. The cord-mark motif keepscropping up again and again. And other patterns repeat, such as distorted humanfaces sculpted into the shoulders of vases. Pottery masks have been found thatreplicate their gargoyle expressions and one particular style of mask, with itsnose bent at right angles to the side of its face, seems weirdly futuristic; itcould almost be a contemporary work in a gallery of surrealist art; instead, itis 4500 years old, as old as the Great Pyramid, and part of an ancient Jomontradition of representing the human form.DOGUAlthough I have not personally seen examples more than 8000 years old,archaeologists I have talked to in Japan assure me that simple potteryrepresentations of the human figure have been found in strata dating back morethan 12,000 years. These earliest figures, and all the later examples, are knownin Japan by the generic term dogu.The best-known dogu date from around 3000 years ago and are better described as‘anthropoid’ than human – since it is by no means certain that the figures theyrepresent are human beings. They have hands and feet, legs and arms and a head,like human beings, but their features are weirdly distorted -almost as thoughthey are concealed behind some kind of face-mask or helmet. The eyes of thesefigures are most disconcerting, being depicted as large ovals each with a singlehorizontal slit.Other dogu are very different, some seeming to freeze a tortured human face inthe act of screaming, some imposing the features of an animal – a cat forexample – on to an otherwise human form, some creating the appearance ofmythological beings with the body unnaturally elongated or the facelozenge-shaped. There are multiple examples of exaggerated female figures,notably the 5000-year-old ‘Venus of the Jomon’ found recently at TanabatakeIseki in Nagano Prefecture. With her gigantic thighs and hips, this ‘mothergoddess’ is similar in proportion and general appearance (and possibly infunction as well) to stone Venus figures found in the megalithic temples andunderground labyrinths of the far-off Mediterranean island of Malta (seechapters 16–20).It is difficult to guess what the Jomon were trying to achieve through theproduction of so many different kinds of dogu over an unbroken period of atleast 10,000 years. It is very likely, but not certain, that these werereligious icons of some kind and were meant to stand in alcoves or niches. Butit is also obvious, looking at them – and indeed at the whole range of Jomonpottery -that they are the work of a prosperous culture with sufficient surplusto support a full-time, professional artisan class dedicated exclusively to theproduction of beautiful and sometimes awe-inspiring objects.THE RICE BOMBSHELLThe next surprise I had about the Jomon concerned their way of life. Sincevisiting Sannai-Muriyama in 1998 I’d been aware that these ‘hunter-gatherers’,somewhat anomalously, sometimes chose to live in large, permanent settlements. Ihad assumed, wrongly, that Sannai-Muryama, built about 4500 years ago, was theearliest of these.Then in April 2000 I visited Uenohara, a much older Jomon site on the island ofKyushu. Kuzanori Aozaki, one of the prefecture’s archaeologists, explained thatUenohara had been a continuously inhabited settlement over a 2000-year periodfrom roughly 9500 to 7500 years ago. ‘They had their lives pretty well workedout,’ he explained. ‘At any one time they had more than 100 people living here.They were comfortable … I would even say prosperous. All their basic needs weremet. They had ample food, good shelter, comfortable, elegant clothing.’‘And this was a permanent settlement, like a village or a small town?’‘Yes.’‘But doesn’t that contradict the idea of the Jomon as simple hunter-gatherers?’‘Yes it does, because the idea is wrong. The more you get to know the Jomon themore you know that they were many things as well as simple hunter-gatherers.’Aozaki went on to tell me how in his opinion the Uenohara community had managedto support itself through a kind of organized ‘agriculture’ and ‘harvesting’ ofthe forest – not quite farming, but certainly a planned husbandry of natureaimed at sustained, long-term survival.This was not to be the last time during a seven-week journey through Japan inApril and May 2000 that I would hear hints of agriculture. At Ofuna C Iseki onHokkaido the chief archaeologist, Chiharu Abe, told me he was convinced that theJomon had ‘farmed’ chestnut trees: ‘They imported seedlings from Honshu and thencultivated them here. To all extents and purposes they were doing agriculture.’Another intriguing recent discovery is that as far back as 8000 years ago theJomon were cultivating a non-indigenous plant, the bottle-gourd, whichpalaeo-biological studies indicate must have been imported from Africa. There isalso some evidence of the cultivation of beans at a very early date. Indeed,according to Profesor Tatsuo Kobyashi, the Jomon made effective use of nearlyevery species of available plants and animals – ‘a conscious and rational use ofnature’s bounty with a low-level use of less desired species to avoid depletionof preferred ones’.Since it was for a long while more or less automatically assumed that the Yayoibrought rice cultivation to Japan it is also highly significant thatarchaeologists have now found undisputed evidence of paddyfield rice cultivationby the Jomon at Itazuke on the island of Kyushu. This evidence has been firmlydated to around 3200 years ago and thus is older than the Yayoi period byseveral hundreds of years. Matsuo Tsukada of the Quaternary Ecology Laboratoryof the University of Washington summed up the findings this way:The oldest evidence of rice pollen [in Japan]… comes from the well-known Itazukesite, Fukuoka, which dates to about 3200 BP. Since the plant is not a Japanesenative, its presence provides definite evidence that rice cultivation began inLate or Latest Jomon in Kyushu. Phylolith studies also support the fact thatrice cultivation began at this time. It has been clear for some time that thenotion that its cultivation appeared in Japan at the beginning of the Yayoi isoutdated. Yet this idea persists in the writings of many specialists in EastAsian archaeology!12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn12]But it was Sahara Makoto, the Director-General of the National Museum ofJapanese History, who dropped the biggest bombshell on my preconceptions aboutthe Jomon. When I met him on 17 May 2000 he told me quite casually of newevidence that had just come his way, unconfirmed as yet but startling if true,which suggested that the Jomon could have been cultivating rice as early as12,000 years ago.REVOLUTIONSo first rice was thought to be a Yayoi introduction to Japan. Then it wasdiscovered that the Jomon grew rice hundreds of years before the arrival of theYayoi. Now suddenly here was the dizzying possibility that the Jomon could havebeen growing rice deep in the Old Stone Age, thousands of years before anybodyelse …‘If that’s true it’s a revolution, isn’t it?’ I stuttered.‘Yes, in a sense,’ replied Makoto, ‘but then you see with the Jomon you alwayshave to be ready for a revolution.’There was other evidence, Makoto now told me, tiny particles of rice that hadsomehow got into the potters’ clay before firing. Known to Jomon scholars for adecade, this evidence concerned several different pieces of pottery and severaldifferent sites, all of them in the range from 5000 to 3000 years old. Somearchaeologists had gone to great lengths to underplay the significance of thesefinds, even arguing that the rice fragments had been brought over from China onthe wind, or on the feet of grasshoppers – any logical contortion would beworthwhile, it would seem, rather than question the central paradigm of theJomon as ‘simple hunter-gatherers’.Yet the more I looked into these matters the more obvious it became thatincreasing numbers of Japanese archaeologists are abandoning the‘hunter-gatherer’ paradigm and are moving towards a new view of the Jomon as asophisticated and very ancient culture – perhaps even as a ‘civilization’.EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABSBecause we keep on learning new things about the Jomon at a very rapid rate itis inevitable that our impression of them will constantly have to be revised. Wehave seen how cherished views about their primitive hunter-gatherer economy arebeing challenged by new evidence of rice-growing. When a find of pottery likethe 16,500-year-old fragments at Odayamamaoto No. 1 Iseki is made, it can pushback previously accepted dating schemes by thousands of years. Indeed, almosteverything is subject to revision. The excavation of sophisticated, well-plannedurban settlements like Sannai-Muryama and Uenohara (the latter going back almost10,000 years) has forced revision of the old idea that Jomon society wasnomadic. Likewise at Sakuramachi Iseki, near Oyabe City in western Honshu,archaeologists have recently excavated examples of 4000-year-old Jomon carpentryusing complex joints, dovetails and corners of a type not previously thought tohave been introduced into Japan before AD 700.Another example of historians radically misdating and misattributing inventions,ideas and icons concerns the classic curved jewel of the Japanese nobility – thecomma-shaped (or foetus-shaped?) magatama, often carved from jade. References tomagatama in Japan’s national epic, the Nihon Shoki, which was compiled at theend of the seventh century AD, and the frequent finds of magatama inarchaeological sites of that period have led most Japanese to an unquestionedassumption that the magatama is an invention of the so-called ‘Yayoi’ and‘Kofun’ periods, roughly from 300 BC to AD 800. Yet on my travels through Japanarchaeologists showed me dozens of beautiful magatama from Jomon times, some ofthem more than 8000 years old.This speaks of more than just the antiquity of Jomon craftsmanship. The realpoint is the way in which a very ancient Jomon religious symbol survived thearrival of the Yayoi in the first millennium BC and continued to be regarded asa revered object at the time when the earliest texts of Japan’s unique Shintoreligion were written down.ROCK TEMPLES OF THE SEA?In how many other ways did the prehistoric culture of the Jomon impose itself onthe culture of the invaders? How much more of the Jomon story remains to betold?There is one obvious line of inquiry to pursue. Archaeologists admit that areasof the Japanese islands that previously stood above water and that at one timewere almost certainly inhabited by the Jomon were inundated at the end of theIce Age. The flooding was less massive and rapid than elsewhere. But since theJomon were and remained for more than 14,000 years predominantly a coastalpeople, it is entirely possible – probable even – that this remorseless rise insea-levels could have concealed important parts of their story. Had they carvedstructures out of rock along the ancient sea-shores, for example, then thesewould have been the first to be covered by the waves.So, alongside the theory that they are freak natural phenomena, and alongsidethe theory that they are the work of a lost civilization, I think there is alsoroom to ask whether the underwater ruins of Japan might not be the work of aknown civilization – the Jomon – in a hitherto unknown and perhaps extraordinaryphase of their culture.BIG STONES; SACRED MOUNTAINSThere is a curious reverence for big stones – iwakura – which persists in Japanto this day. Auspiciously shaped and positioned stones are thought of asjunctures between heaven and earth, places where a god can descend from sky toground. In 1998, following a kind invitation from the Governor of GifuPrefecture, I was able to spend several days exploring iwakura in the beautifulmountainous district of Ena, located near the centre of the Japanese landmass onthe island of Honshu.I was guided by a delightful group of local enthusiasts from the township ofYamaoka, who had formed themselves into a society in order to study all of themegaliths in their region. There were a great many iwakura that they wanted meto see. But here, as so often in Japan, the problem that immediately presenteditself was whether the megaliths in question were in any sense man-made (or even‘man-arranged’) as opposed to being just striking and unusual naturalformations. Many of the towering rock piles, weathered boulders and huge,strangely shaped arrangements of stone that I was shown were, I am certain,entirely natural. However, in Japan – where the wonderful and awe-inspiring innature have been noted and worshipped for millennia – such a provenance does notcontradict ancient beliefs that the stones are sacred shrines descended from theAge of the Gods. Indeed, traditions state that it was here, amongst the rocksand trees of Mount Ena, that the placenta of Amaterasu O-Mikami, the sun-goddessand ancestral mother of the Japanese Imperial Family, was enshrined.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn13]Much less frequent than the natural iwakura of the Ena district are several thatare undoubtedly the work of humans. These include a bizarre chain of greygranite tetrahedrons up to a metre high that run in a straight line throughforests and valleys between the bases of two neighbouring mountains, finallyculminating at a conspicuously large rock which, authorities confirm, was‘worshipped as a deity until recent times’.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn14]Another man-made iwakura, revered by local villagers as ‘the sacred rock deity,the object of worship’ and recently classified by archaeologists at the EnaMunicipality as an Important Cultural Property, was excavated by the late RyuzoTorii, Professor of Archaeology at the Imperial University of Tokyo, who datedit to the Jomon period.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn15] Itconsists of a parallel pair of upright granite megaliths 1.6 metres high thatstand isolated in a forest on the slopes of Mount Nabeyama in the southern partof the Ena Basin. The megaliths, which are massive in cross-section and roughlysquared off, have a gap of a few centimetres between them that is aligned withspectacular effect on the summer solstice sunrise.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn16] More curiously, a straight linejoining the tops of the two megaliths and extended northwards culminates at thesacred mountain of Kasagi, where numerous Jomon artefacts have been excavated byarchaeologists.17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn17] An archaicceremony of unknown origin that was conducted there until recent times involvedthe procession of a huge model serpent with scales made of leaves of magnoliahypoleuca followed by villagers praying to the mountain itself for rain.18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn18][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_167_r1.jpg]There are many sacred mountains in Japan. They are known as reizan (which meanssimply ‘the sacred mountain’) and also as shintaizan, which means ‘the mountainas object of worship’.19 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn19] Theevidence from the radar-mapping and excavations at Kuromata Yama raises thepossibility that at least some of these mountains might have been ‘landscaped’by the Jomon in similar ways. Whether entirely natural, or touched by man,however, much suggests that they were sacred first to the Jomon and theninherited by later cultures.Take the case of Hakuzan (‘white mountain’) in western Honshu. A focus of activepilgrimage today, the roots of its sanctity seem to be extremely ancient. Thisat any rate is a legitimate interpretation of recent archaeological evidencefrom the Jomon site of Chichamori Iseki near the modern city of Kanazawa. Aswell as many beautiful pieces of Jomon pottery, dogu figures and magatama,excavations at Chichamori Iseki have revealed the remains of two spacious‘wood-henges’, built by the Jomon, which are thought to be about 3600 years old.The uprights consist of the split trunks of twelve huge chestnut trees arrangedin a circle. Each circle has a ceremonial entrance aligned exactly on Hakuzan.And just as the Jomon seem the most likely source of the sacred mountain idea,so it seems increasingly obvious that the origin of the iwakura idea must betheirs too.After visiting Kuromata Yama and the Oyu stone circles in 1998 I returned to theAomori region in May 2000 on hearing the news that seven small stone circles hadbeen uncovered by archaeologists at the great Jomon settlement ofSannai-Muryama. They had been measured and catalogued and then immediatelyburied again by the excavators. A few kilometres away another, much larger Jomonstone circle (more exactly, it should be described as an oval, since it issomewhat elliptical in shape] had also recently been excavated and had been leftexposed. Its name is Komakino Iseki. Climbing on to the top of a plinth to getan overview of it, I could see that the outer circle, or oval, built up out ofdistinctive rounded river stones, had a diameter of about 150 metres and that itin turn surrounded a series of inner rings arranged concentrically, with groupsof smaller ovals – touching at the edges like the links of a chain -sometimesscattered across the width of a ring.Komakino Iseki, which will have an important part to play later in this story,is thought to be about 4500 years old.From Aomori I travelled further north to the island of Hokkaido. There withinhalf an hour’s drive of the modern port of Otaru I visited three more stonecircles. Two of them, Nishizaki-Yama and Jichin-Yama, crown hill-tops, theformer with a mass of small, interconnected stone circles, the latter with aring of mid-sized megaliths. The third, Oshoro, is the largest intact circle inJapan and includes on its south side twenty stones that are in the half-tonnerange. Like Komakino Iseki, Oshoro is arranged in concentric circles.Excavations suggest that it is about 4000 years old.A HELPING HANDWe had a strange experience at Oshoro – which I visited, as always, with Santha.Two friends were also with us there – the historian Akira Suzuki and ShunDaichi, the Japanese translator of my books. Had they not witnessed whathappened I would hesitate to report it.From the perspective of a photographer the problem with Oshoro is that it is toobig. As at Komakino Iseki it was therefore necessary to climb on top ofsomething in order to get an overview. And, as at Komakino Iseki, the localgovernment had conveniently provided a stone plinth, bearing a carvedinscription, on top of which it was possible to climb. At Oshoro the plinth wasa thick granite column about a metre and a half high mounted on top of ametre-high stone and concrete base.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_168_r1.jpg]Hanging on to the branches of a nearby tree, I scrambled on to the base, with myfeet on either side of the column, then hauled myself up the column and perchedunsteadily on top of it. I spent five minutes sitting up there with my videocamera shooting panoramics of the stone circle, wanting to remember the scaleand flow of the great outer ring, looking at the soft shadows the megalithscast, at the manner in which the sunlight descended on them, trying to put myfinger on the special way they felt they belonged among the tall cedars thatgrew around and amongst them. Wind blew, still a cold wind in May at thislatitude in Japan, rustling through the trees, whistling down from the stillsnow-covered mountains of Hokkaido. And it was easy to visualize the spirit ofthe wind, the spirit of the trees, the spirit of the stone, the spirit of thesun – as I knew the ancient Japanese had – not just as poetic metaphors fornatural powers but as real trans dimensional entities capable of operating inboth the spiritual and material realms.The characters of these kami – let us call them by their Japanese name – are notalways consistent or predictable. They are more than spirits. But, although theword kami is often translated into English as ‘god’, a kami is less than God inthe Judaeo-Christian sense. Kami are supernaturally powerful, but notomnipotent. They can be killed. Sometimes they do good for mankind, sometimesthey might harm us. They are everywhere, in everything. And it always pays totreat them with respect.I lowered myself down from the granite column, placed my feet on the ground, andturned to put the video away in our rented car which was parked right behind usjust outside the northern edge of the circle. Meanwhile, Santha, Suzuki and Shunhad also been standing just outside the circle immediately behind the column.Now that I’d finished filming from it, Santha handed her Nikons over to Shun,stepped forward, climbed on to the platform, then wrapped her arms around thegranite pillar and tried to shin up.I’m quite heavily built and I think that when I climbed I must have loosened thecement that held the pillar to its base. Now as Santha began her climb thepillar rocked dangerously then broke off completely. For a moment she and thepillar seemed to hang in mid-air, locked in a deadly embrace; then the solidgranite mass, weighing perhaps 100 kilos, bore her down to the ground andsmashed her into it with an awful thud.It all happened so quickly, that Shun, Suzuki and I were dumbfounded, stunned,confused. For a moment none of us could move, then we rushed to lift the pillarthat lay diagonally across Santha’s body pinning her from her pelvis, across herribs and over her left shoulder, just missing her neck and her face. It took allour strength and a determined effort to move the big, sharp-cornered stone andas we hefted its weight I had a horrified premonition of the terrible internaldamage that it must have done in such a fall.Santha was gasping with shock, her eyes rolling upwards, exposing the whites. Acouple of times she cried out, ‘I’m dying, I’m dying.’While an ambulance was called I gingerly felt her ribs, her collarbone, her hip,finding nothing broken, trying to reassure her. Gradually she quietened theninformed me in an almost normal voice. ‘Somebody caught me as I was falling. Ahand came from behind me, over the top of my shoulder, and supported the stone.Another hand pressed into my back as I went down. It stopped me hitting theground too hard.’I presumed it must have been Shun or Suzuki since it certainly hadn’t been me –I hadn’t even seen the whole thing, let alone been fast enough to lend a helpinghand. But I paid no further attention to the matter then and didn’t remember ituntil Santha brought it up again later that day after being discharged from theexcellent private hospital in Otaru where her injuries were thoroughly scanned,x-rayed, examined and found to be minor. Bruised ribs and a twisted neck wereabout the worst of it – although strangely as I write these words eighteenmonths after the accident, Santha’s ribs are still bruised, still tender andpainful, though they long ago should have healed.Amazingly there was no further damage and everyone, particularly the ambulanceparamedics who had seen the size of the object that she had fallen under,regarded her escape as a miracle. Santha put it down more simply to the fastactions of Shun or Suzuki reaching out from behind her to take the weight of thepillar and cushion her fall.But this was where the mystery began. Because as we talked the whole incidentthrough with Shun and Suzuki the next day it emerged that neither of them hadreached out a hand to catch Santha. Shun had been standing too far back andholding her cameras; Suzuki had been looking the other way when she fell. ButSantha remained adamant that she had seen a man’s hand coming in over her leftshoulder to support the pillar and had felt a hand cushioning her back as well …As we inquired into the matter further a curious story began to unfold. Itseemed that we had arrived at Oshoro one day later than planned and that ouroriginal schedule had included a visit to a private house near the stone circle,where a small museum of objects from Oshoro was kept. This house belonged to thefamily of a farmer, now deceased, who had spent almost half a century as theself-appointed guardian and caretaker of the stone circle, which he was known tohave loved and venerated. The objects in the museum had been his own collection.When we did arrive a day late, the family was not there to receive us, so wewent ahead with our visit to Oshoro without meeting them. Santha’s accidentoccurred and she had a powerful personal experience of some sort of miraculousintervention. What we learned later was that the family had been away attendingthe memorial service for the farmer whose death, it transpired, had occurredeight years previously on that very day.At Santha’s request Suzuki telephoned the farmer’s daughter from our hotel. Shehad already heard of Santha’s accident at the stone circle and wanted us to knowthat she was angry with the spirit of her father for having failed to preventit. Suzuki then told her of Santha’s experience of being rescued and saved fromserious harm by the strong and gentle hands of a man no one had seen, andtranslated Santha’s honest question – did she think the rescuer could have beenthe spirit of her father?Of course she thought that. We all did. For no matter how modern, rational andscientific Japan has become, it is still a land in which powerful and ineffablespiritual forces are perceived to move in secret behind all things, to pervadeall things, and to underlie the very fabric of reality.Isn’t it obvious that such ideas are extremely old?THE GOD IN THE MOUNTAINFar away from Oshoro in Nara Prefecture on the island of Honshu, there is asacred mountain called Miwa-Yama. In a pattern with which I was now becomingfamiliar, this entire pyramid-shaped mountain is considered by Japan’sindigenous Shinto religion to be a shrine, possessed by the spirit of a god who‘stayed his soul’ within it in ancient times.20[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn20] His correct name isOmononushino-Kami (although he is also popularly known as Daikokusama) andaccording to the ancient texts he is ‘the guardian deity of human life’ whotaught mankind how to cure disease, manufacture medicines and grow crops.21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn21] His symbol, very strikingly, isa serpent – and to this day serpents are still venerated at Mount Miwa, wherepilgrims bring them boiled eggs and cups of sake.22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn22][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_169_r1.jpg]In May 2000 the Shinto priests of Miwa processed me through the elaboratepurification and blessing ceremony that is necessary for any pilgrim wishing toclimb the mountain. Among other procedures this involved a ritual washing of myhands and mouth from a pure-water spring – over which reared the serpent icon ofthe god.The climb itself, on a beautiful sunlit morning, took about two hours. From thebeginning the way was steep and the path frequently led beside a tumblingstream.Near the base of the mountain at the side of the path was a shrine consisting ofa group of megaliths, each weighing a tonne or more and some showing signs ofhaving been quarried or cut. On the right-hand side of this shrine, under atowering cedar tree, the devout had placed a dozen small statues of serpents.My guide was a young Shinto priest. Seeing my interest in the rock shrine, hepointed out several other examples to me on the way up. In each case theseshrines consisted of a single boulder or a group of boulders adorned with loopsof thick rope. Some of the boulders seemed to have been arranged artificially;others appeared to be in entirely natural dispositions.At the summit of the mountain we came upon a huge collection of iwakura forminga spacious, filled-in circle. It was hard to believe that these massive bouldershad all just congregated here on this high point by chance. On the contrary,from what I had already seen of the Jomon obsession with stone circles and withthe landscaping of mountains, Miwa-Yama’s summit shrine looked like somethingthat would have been well within their repertoire. Indeed, in many ways it wastypical of their open-air ‘rock temples’. It felt strange, therefore, to seemodern pilgrims assembled here wearing white smocks over jeans, and to realizeas they chanted the name of Omononushi-no-Kami, the god whose spirit hadpossessed the mountain, that in many ways Japan is still a Jomon country.‘As to mountain worship,’ writes Professor Hideo Kishimoto of Tokyo University,Its significance may change as the ages pass away, and its interpretation mayvary according to the individuals. But people’s feeling of admiration andreverence to the mountain will not be affected by time so long as it soarssublimely into the sky with infinite mystery breeding solemn atmosphere. InMount Miwa, a Shinto faith, based on such feeling, shows living force.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn23]CULT OF STONESurrounding Mount Miwa is the district of Asuka – a treasure house of tombs andruins. Here there are hundreds of the keyhole-shaped mounds, known as kofun -the name Kofun is also applied to the culture that built them, the immediatesuccessors to the Yayoi. The mounds are thought to have served as the tombs ofthe earliest members of Japan’s imperial family – roughly from the fourth to theeighth centuries AD – and of the nobility of that period. Even in our ownenlightened twenty-first century, the emperor does not permit intact kofun to beexcavated, and so archaeological understanding of these mysterious structuresremains sketchy. All that can be said for certain is that their dating to thefirst millennium AD seems to be securely based on a wide range of evidence froma few kofun that had been opened for one reason or another during pastcenturies.Under the pyramidial central earth mound it is now clear that all kofun concealan inner megalithic burial chamber and a megalithic passageway, usually orientedsouth. One of the most spectacular of these ‘barrow’ structures, Ishibutai,thought to date to the seventh century AD, can be visited today because erosionlong ago exposed and isolated its megalithic core. The two giant stones thatform its ceiling weigh close to 100 tonnes each while the lesser stones of theside walls and the passageway are still enormous megaliths by any standards,weighing between 10 and 20 tonnes.Near by are dozens of other megalithic ruins, all of which are thought to dateto the same period around 1400 years ago. One, Kameishi Iwa, is a large rockcarved into the form of a turtle. Another, Sakafune-ishi, is a granite slab intowhich has been cut, with remarkable precision – but as yet undetermined purpose– a circuit-like pattern of geometrical grooves and channels. A third consistsof the upper and lower parts of a rock-hewn tomb (known locally as Onino Sechin– literally ‘demon’s toilet’! – and Onino Manaita, literally ‘demon’s choppingboard’). The two parts were separated in an ancient earthquake and now a modernroad runs between them.But by far the most strikingly enigmatic of the Asuka megaliths is the Masuda-noIwafune, the ‘boat stone’ (so-called because it is thought to resemble acapsized boat), which juts out from a densely wooded hillside. Consisting of onemass of granite weighing in the region of 1000 tonnes, it is 10 metres long, 8metres wide and almost 4 metres high. One puzzling characteristic is that inplaces it is rough and unfinished, seeming entirely like a work of nature, andin other places beautifully cut into right-angled planes.Although there are theories, and a date in the seventh century AD is preferredby most scholars, no archaeologist is in a position to state with certainty howold the Masuda-no Iwafune really is or what its original function might havebeen. There are some indications of astronomical orientation but these are toovague to be of any use,24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn24] and,as the Asuka Historical Museum admits, the ‘actual purpose’ of the greatmegalith ‘remains a mystery’.25 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn25]All that can be said for sure is that its presence testifies to the long-termpersistence and vigour of a cult of stone in Japan – stone on a gigantic scale,either natural or artificially cut (or both at the same time), serving as aninterface between earth and heaven. It is not difficult to imagine how such acult that was in one place and time responsible for the Masuda-no Iwafune and inanother for the Jomon stone circles could, in yet another, have made monumentslike those later inundated by the sea at Yonaguni and Kerama.KERAMA: ENTRANCE TO THE UNDERWORLDDiving well is all about relaxation. It’s like good sex. If your body and mindare relaxed you can go on for ever … But how can you be relaxed when you’realmost 30 metres under a deep blue sea in a place where a powerful current cansuddenly whip up, like a gale-force wind, and have you fighting for your life inseconds? How can you be relaxed if you pause to think even for a moment aboutthe vastness of the ocean and the improbable smallness of yourself, or about thefragility of your body, or about your life-or-death reliance on your equipmentwith its fallible valves and tubes?I made my first dives at Kerama in April 1999 and found it a dark and scaryplace. In April 2000, a year later, I came back for more.We worked from a rented cabin cruiser owned by Isamu Tsukahara, a local diverwho has made a speciality of exploring the underwater stone circles. Also withus was another professional diver, Mitsutoshi Taniguchi, who discovered ‘CentreCircle’ more than twenty-five years ago and who has written a book on thesubject. We were joined by Kiyoshi Nagaki from Chatan, a brilliant diver who hadsaved Santha’s life the year before at Pohnpei in Micronesia when sheaccidentally began to descend into deep water with her air turned off. Anothermember of the team at Kerama was our old friend Shun Daichi, the translator ofFingerprints of the Gods. In addition, Tsukahara had two of his staff diverswith us underwater at all times – so we were a large group.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_170_r1.jpg]But it was one of those perfect days that every diver dreams of. Although thecurrent was still running strong when we first arrived at the site, it haddropped to nothing an hour later when we rolled into the water. We then sankdown, in absolute stillness, through a cool, blue column of ocean lit by sparksand splinters of sunlight.I had experienced before a certain dizziness at Kerama and I experienced itagain now as I descended in a wide spiral over the megaliths of Centre Circle.Dropping into the circle itself, I reached bottom at the base of the centralmonolith, where my gauges registered a depth of 27 metres (as against a depth atthe top of the monolith of 23 metres).While the other divers pursued their own interests I sat at the base of themonolith looking up at the ring of huge cut stones towering above me. Then Iswam several times around the circle and followed side channels out of it, someof which lead to a second monument – the one that local divers call ‘SmallCentre Circle’ – while others lead nowhere. The whole place felt like a maze, ora labyrinth in which it was extremely easy to become disoriented. Glad of theopen sea above me I relaxed and allowed myself to ascend until I floatedweightless about 3 metres above the top of the circle, looking down through bluewater at the bizarre and out-of-place structure.From this perspective, in this light, it seemed like the entrance to afairy-tale kingdom, a spiral stairway into the underworld … I was filled with asense of awe and wonder, and of numinous dread. I have experienced the samefeeling at other religious monuments – the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe,the Pyramids of Egypt, Stonehenge, the Hypogeum and the megalithic temples ofancient Malta …‘If the Jomon built this,’ I found myself wondering, ‘then what else might theyhave built?’ But did the Jomon build it? Was it even man-made at all?ISEKI POINTWhen we consider the Kerama and Yonaguni underwater monuments in the light ofwhat is known about the veneration of sacred mountains and stone circles inprehistoric Japan, they make perfect sense and do not in any way appearoutlandish or improbable. With the notable exception of Kuromata Yama, they areon a larger scale than any Jomon structure previously known on land; however,they are of the general type of shrine that we know the Jomon could and didmake. The circles speak for themselves in this matter – since no one can denythat stone circles played an important role in Jomon culture – and it takeslittle imagination to see the terraces of the Yonaguni main monument as theresult of an extension of the iwakura and sacred mountain principles that wereso well established in Jomon times.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_171_r1.jpg]Unlike Kerama, where the dive site is far out in the open sea, Yonaguni’s mainmonument lies close to the present southern shore under a glowering mudstonecliff. The locals call it ‘Iseki Point’ (‘Monument Point’) and make much of itsterracing; however, this is not the only aspect of the site that impresses me.Less obvious, but more persuasive, is the way that the whole layout seems to beorganized cardinally and ceremonially.Tucked in behind the north-west corner of the monument and oriented east-west,two huge, clean-cut megaliths, thought to weigh about 100 tonnes each, liestacked side-by-side like slices of toast. It is obvious that they bear astriking resemblance to the parallel megaliths of Mount Nabeyama in GifuPrefecture (see diagram page 620). I suggest that they are unlikely to havefallen into such a position by chance, that they are intended as a focal point,and that the gap between them, as at Gifu, may prove to have a solar alignment(in this case equinoctial rather than solstitial). They are approached through anarrow tunnel of big, symmetrical boulders piled on top of one another in twocourses.To the south and west are what appear to be the ruins of a walled complex with acurved ramp.A clearly defined path or causeway runs from west to east along the monument’ssouth face.At the extreme western end of the causeway the diver comes to a classic iwakurashrine, part natural rock, part man-made.26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn26] If this shrine were to be movedto the slopes of Mount Miwa it would blend in seamlessly with what is alreadythere.RIDING THE BLACK CURRENTJapan is not a small country, but it was bigger 17,000 years ago at the end ofthe Ice Age, just before the global floods began. Once the meltdown was properlyunderway, however, the land-bridges to the mainland were rapidly inundated andthe islands began a long process of shrinkage that still continues to this day.As recently as 9000, possibly 8000, years ago the island of Shikoku was stillpart of a continuous landmass with neighbouring Honshu. Then the remorselesssea-level rise cut it off and ever since has continued to whittle away at itsboundaries. Looking at the modern map, it is instructive to remember that theJomon were there to witness the sea rush in to fill the lowlands betweenTakamatsu and Tamano – as indeed they witnessed all the strange phenomena andearth changes that marked the end of the Ice Age.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_172_r1.jpg]The Black Current between Japan and the Americas. Based on Meggars et al.(1965).Perhaps it was this experience of rapid and invincible floods that led them tobecome navigators or perhaps they inherited their knowledge of the sea from thesame unidentified ‘influence’ that brought them pottery and stone circles.Either way, it has for a long while been generally accepted amongst scholarsthat the Jomon traded extensively throughout the Japanese islands, and with themainland, and must therefore have been using sea-going boats from a very earlydate.More controversially, there is a growing body of evidence which suggests thatthe Jomon may not have confined themselves to exploring their own region.According to the findings of an international team of researchers led by C.Loring Brace of the University of Michigan’s Museum of Anthropology, migrantsentering North America across the Bering land-bridge at the end of the Ice Agewere ‘people closely resembling the prehistoric Jomon of Japan’.27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn27] Published in the 31 July 2001edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the findingsprovide:strong evidence supporting earlier work suggesting that ancient Americans … weredescended from the Jomon, who walked from Japan to the Asian mainland andeventually to the Western hemisphere on land-bridges as the Earth began to warmup about 15,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age.28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn28]But perhaps they didn’t always walk. There is at any rate evidence from a laterperiod, approximately 5000 years ago, that they may have undertaken transoceanicvoyages, reaching as far as the shores of South America. The most famous, thoughstill disputed and controversial, case is the discovery at Valdivia in Ecuadorof what has been claimed to be Jomon pottery in deposits more than 5000 yearsold. But Jomon pottery has also turned up in almost equally ancient layersacross the South Pacific – at Fiji, for example, and at Vanuatu. ‘It’sreasonable to conclude’, says Professor Yoshihiko Shinoto of the Bishop Museumin Hawaii, ‘that the Jomon travelled very widely in the Pacific area. Of coursethey could only have done so by sea.’One route of migration that would have been open to them runs past CapeAshizuri, the southernmost point of Shikoku, and then flows northwards fromthere up the eastern side of the Japanese archipelago, swings out across thePacific with the Kuryl and Aleutian islands, comes close to land again along thenorthern California coast and runs south from there past the Pacific coast ofCentral America until it reaches Ecuador. This route, a kind of ‘highway in thesea’, is known in Japan as the ‘Black Current’ (Kuroshio) and is most visiblewhere it passes Shikoku at Cape Ashizuri – running like a river at a steady 40nautical miles per day. Given sufficient time and the survival of its crew, itis easy to see how a boat could ride the black current from Japan to SouthAmerica.COVERING UNIMAGINABLE DISTANCESWords cannot express the degree of similarity between early Valdivia andcontemporary Jomon pottery … Not only techniques of incision but motifs andcombinations of motifs are the same. In most categories of decorative techniqueexamples can be found so similar in appearance that they might almost have comefrom the same vessel.29 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c25-ftn29]With these observations, Smithsonian Institution anthropologists Betty Meggers,Clifford Evans and Emilio Estrada sparked off a storm of controversy that isstill blowing today. ‘Early Valdivia’ means at least 5000 years ago and,according to the orthodox model of history, Japanese hunter-gatherers, evenstrange ones who made pots, are not supposed to have had the capacity to sailacross the Pacific 5000 years ago. Yet what Meggers, Evans and Estrada found inValdivia – thousands of pieces of Jomon pottery in securely dated strata – seemsto prove the orthodox model wrong. Once their results were properly codified itbecame clear that ‘twenty-four of the twenty-eight major characteristics of theValdivian pots were found in Jomon pottery. Their decorative elements and theconstruction of their spouts were among the most striking of the similarities.’Meggers, Evans and Estrada published their revolutionary thesis in SmithsonianContributions to Anthropology in 1965. Their ideas, which they themselves stickby, have been neither universally accepted by scholars nor conclusivelyrejected.In Japan I found that Sahara Makoto was not a supporter of the ‘Valdivia’connection, preferring to put down to coincidence all the numerous similaritiesbetween Jomon and Valdivia pottery. Conversely, Yasuhiro Okada, ChiefArchaeologist at Sannai-Muryama, feels it is ‘very likely’ that the pottery ofValdivia was influenced by Jomon migrants 5000 years ago. ‘More and more’, hetold me, ‘I am coming to realize that we cannot understand the Jomon if we viewthem only in the context of Japan. They were Pacific voyagers. They used thesea.’ Professor Mozai Torao of Tokyo University agrees:It may be assumed that, before the dawn of history, ancient peoples werewell-travelled, going far and wide on the earth by way of navigation or drift,that they in fact covered distances quite unimaginable for modern people.STONE BOATI visited Cape Ashizuri on the invitation of a Japanese politician, SenatorSadao Hirano of Kochi Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. He had heard of myinterest in the possible Jomon origins of Japan’s veneration of big stones andwanted to draw my attention to the existence of large groups of iwakurascattered like sentinels along the hilly margins of the Cape, all of themoverlooking the Black Current. Showing us around were volunteer members of alocal amateur historical association, the Ashizuri Jomon Kyoseki, who are makinga long-term study of the megaliths and who are convinced that they were the workof the Jomon.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_173_r1.jpg]On several occasions over those two days as I was guided from rock shrine torock shrine in the tree-covered hills I had the strange sense that I was divingagain. This was because many of the Ashizuri megaliths are lost in the depths offorests where even at midday the bright light of the sun hardly penetrates.Standing on the floor of such a forest feels like standing on the bed of a deepgreen sea.In one enchanted glade I came upon the carved figure of a turtle’s head juttingout of a boulder. Elsewhere, a group of twenty megaliths, like smaller versionsof the sarsens of Stonehenge, lay scattered around, overgrown by weeds andgrass. In a clearing I found a stone circle made up of six large slabs. Near by,at the bottom of a narrow defile, a phallus-shaped menhir stood erect,surmounted by a second smaller boulder seemingly representing the glans. Iwalked on, climbed a forested hillside and arrived eventually at a grey stoneblock, 10 metres long, that had been carved into the shape of a boat with a highprow.As I stood silently amongst the trees and the rock, looking up at the distantsun, I felt the prow of the stone boat beneath my fingers and was reminded againof the very many ways in which the Jomon are still alive today – alive throughtheir pottery, alive through their sacred mountains, alive through rock shrinesin deserted forests and in the depths of the sea, alive as great and powerfulancestral kami, alive as ideas embedded within the mysteries of the Shintoreligion. And as I thought through everything I had learned about the Jomon Irealized how far I had moved from the original preconceptions I had held aboutthem. For here were a people who had explored their world by land and sea –reaching the Americas at least twice between 15,000 and 5000 years ago. Herewere a people who had used pottery millennia before anyone else and gone on torefine it into a beautiful art form. Here were a people who engineered theirlandscape to create sacred mountains, circles of stone, temples of rock. Herewere a people who lived in harmony with their environment, who made use of anintelligent mixture of strategies to ensure comfortable survival and securityfor the future, and who successfully avoided the pitfalls of militarism,materialism, conspicuous consumption and overpopulation that so many othercultures of the ancient world lost their way in. Here, above all, was a peoplewhose civilization remained intact and flourished – decently, humanely, evengenerously, as far as we can know these things from the archaeological record,for more than 14,000 years.If they could only speak to us, despite the lapse of time, what secrets wouldthe Jomon have to tell of the true story and mystery of ancient Japan?"},{"pageContent":"26 / REMEMBRANCEWhen Sosano went up to Heaven, by reason of the fierceness of his divine naturethere was a commotion in the sea, and the hills and mountains groaned aloud.NihongiA haunting refrain, played softly, winds its way through the myth-memories ofancient Japan. It is the story of a journey to the realm of gloom that liesbeyond death – to the Land of Yomi, the Underworld of the oldest Shinto texts.It is also the story of a sojourn on an enchanted island. And it is the story ofa voyage underwater to the Kingdom of the Sea King.The plots and characters differ. However, the story always involves a loveaffair; the female partner always remains in the mystical kingdom; and the malepartner always returns to the sublunary world. Such shared details do not feelaccidental. But where do they come from? More specifically, is some sort ofassociation implied between the enchanted island, the submerged ‘towers’ and‘palaces’ of the underwater kingdom, and the Underworld of Yomi in which thesoul must tarry after death?In my search for the Jomon, described in chapter 25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c25_r1.htm#c25], I travelled very widely around Japanvisiting a series of important Jomon sites all the way from Kyushu in the southto Hokkaido in the north and listening to the wisdom of the leading fieldarchaeologists. These experiences equipped me with some sense of the Jomon wayof life, of their relationships with each other and with nature, of their uniqueceramic art, of their spiritual system centred upon the veneration of stone andmountains, and of their belief – attested in burial practices at Sannai-Muryamaand elsewhere – that the soul survives death.But still I seemed to be only scratching the surface: the Jomon did not make useof a written language, and a thousand years of Yayoi and Kofun culture separatedthe end of the Jomon period from Japan’s earliest surviving written collectionsof scriptures, myths and traditions. It seemed impossible, therefore, for theJomon to ‘speak for themselves’ – and I often felt as though I was dealing witha civilization that was completely mute.Or was I missing something?THE UNRECOGNIZED LEGACY OF 14,000 YEARSJapan, of course, has texts, scriptures, myths and traditions in abundance, butscholars have consistently treated them as irrelevant to the problem of Jomon –and the Jomon as irrelevant to the texts.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn1] And while there is noarchaeological evidence that a complete ‘cultural replacement’ took place inJapan at the transition from Jomon to Yayoi (quite the contrary, it was a longprocess of assimilation and syncretization), most scholars and members of thepublic nevertheless continue to behave as though a complete cultural replacementdid in fact occur – and thus feel justified in ignoring or underplaying thepossibility that 14,000 years of continuous Jomon culture must surely have leftsome mark, and perhaps a very deep one, on almost everything and anything thatis truly Japanese.As I began to suspect the extent to which Japan might still be a Jomon country Itherefore also began to look from a new perspective at the handful of Shintotexts, centred around the famous Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, which together providealmost the only surviving repositories of authentic Japanese myths, legends andtraditions. If so much else goes back to the Jomon, including some of the rootconcepts of Shintoism itself, as we saw in chapter 25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c25_r1.htm#c25], then it is absurd that the stories andideas preserved in the ancient texts should continue to be treated as thoughthey are exclusively the innovations of the Yayoi or later cultures – and thusimmune from Jomon influence. This habitual posture of scholars has the effect ofcompressing Japan’s entire classical ‘myth bank’ -and the search for its origins– into that period of just over 1000 years that separates the earliestarchaeological evidence of the Yayoi in Japan, at around 400 BC, from the firstwritten codification of the myths in the Kojiki, at around AD 712. Within suchboundaries, scholars happily discuss influences that have come from as farafield as China, the South Pacific and India. But the possibility that some ofthe classical myths might have Jomon origins has never been seriouslyconsidered.2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn2]Are we to suppose then that this extremely old and gifted culture accumulated nomythology of its own during the vast span that it held complete possession ofthe land of Japan? That doesn’t seem reasonable. Yet how else are we to explainthe alleged silence of the Jomon in the historical and mythical testimony ofthat land?One possibility might be that the gods, myths and spiritual ideas of thelatecoming Yayoi were so powerful that they not only displaced Jomon mythologybut also annihilated it so completely that not a word of it would ever beremembered again.Alternatively – in this as in Japan’s age-old veneration of divine mountains andsacred rocks – the myth-memories preserved in the ancient texts might conceal aprofound Jomon legacy.THE SURVIVING RECORDS AND THEIR LIMITATIONSFirst and foremost, if we discount rumours of two texts said to have beencompiled in more ancient times but unfortunately lost,3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn3] it is essential to register thatnothing of a mythical nature seems to have been written down – nothing at all -until the early years of the eighth century AD.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn4]Before that, as was the case in India, the old stories, religious teachings andhistories were preserved and constantly repromulgated within what seems to havebeen entirely an oral tradition. Although a professional corporation of‘reciters’ (Kitari-be) did exist in Japan,5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn5] giving cause for hope that muchmight have been saved, it is not clear how reliable or systematic the oraltradition was, to what extent it was subject to change and corruption, or atwhat pace such processes may have occurred. However, by the year 682, thefortieth emperor Temmu-Tenno, who reigned from 673 to 686, was sufficientlyconcerned to order the collection from all reliable and accepted sources of‘true traditions and genealogies’.6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn6] Before Temmu-Tenno died in 686the compilation had been committed to memory by a professional reciter who, itwas said, could ‘repeat with his mouth whatever his eyes saw, and remember inhis heart whatever struck his ears’.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn7] The project was then shelved fortwenty-five years. Then at last the Empress Gemmei ordered that such of theancient lore as the reciter still remembered should be written down.8[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn8]The end result, completed around the year 712, is the Kojiki (Records of AncientMatters), the fundamental scripture of the Shinto religion.9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn9] Although it expounds at length onthe ‘Age of the Gods’ before history began, and on legendary emperors whomarchaeologists do not recognize, it is also a historical document that tells thestory of historical Emperors and of the Japanese people down to 628.10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn10]Second in importance to the Kojiki is the Nihon Shoki (also known as theNihongi), which issued forth from the court in 720.11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn11] Conceived of as a history androyal chronicle, it presents the annals of Japan from the earliest times down to697.12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn12] In practice its subjectmatter is often identical or very close to the subject matter of the Kojiki,however:the older material is amplified and reclassified, and the whole recital isperceptibly tinctured with Chinese philosophy. Some few legends are omitted andothers added, while variants are given of the main episodes.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn13]Other texts that carry down small or large fragments of the myths that werecirculating orally in Japan in the eighth century are the Manyoshu (the firstgreat anthology of Japanese poetry, which includes mythological tales) and theFudoki (Records of Wind and Earth). Though only five Fudoki have come down to usintact, these texts were once part of a huge archive of books compiled byregional authorities to record local traditions after a government edict in713.14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn14]Early in the ninth century the Kogo-shui, or ‘Collection of Omitted Sayings’,was compiled by Imibe-no Hironari. As well as giving eleven myth stories notincluded in either the Kojiki or Nihongi, it continues the history of Japan downto 807.15 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn15]Finally, though their contribution is not so large, the Shojiroku (ninthcentury) and the Engi-sheki (tenth century) are the other principal sources ofauthentic Japanese myths.16 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn16]We need to understand the limitations of these sources: * They are not and cannot be comprehensive. What they do is ‘flash-freeze’ a particular selection of Japanese mythology – no doubt driven and shaped by the subjective concerns of the individual compilers – at a particular moment in history. * There is no way of knowing how representative they are of the whole body of Japanese myths just prior to the era of codification. Most authorities agree that a great deal must be missing. * Likewise when even rice – so long assumed to have been exclusively a Yayoi innovation in Japan – turns out to have been grown by the Jomon in pre-Yayoi times (see chapter 25 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c25_r1.htm#c25]), then one has to wonder on what basis it is possible for scholars to conclude anything worthwhile at all about the epoch or epochs in which the original myths originated. The problem is worsened by the ways in which – like a badly damaged archaeological site – the strata of the traditional stories were ploughed and jumbled by corrupted retellings while they were still within the oral tradition, with further confusion and even political agendas introduced at the stage of compilation.17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn17]MYTHS AND MEMORIESMythology has been described by Robert Graves as ‘the study of whateverreligious or heroic legends are so foreign to a student’s experience that hecannot believe them to be true. Hence the English adjective “mythical”, meaning“incredible”.’18 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn18]This strikes me as quite an accurate general description of what most scholarswho study myth think they are doing and also of their fundamental attitudetowards their subject matter – i.e. that myths are ‘incredible’ fictionscomposed in the ancient world either ‘to answer the sort of awkward questionsthat children ask’ or ‘to justify an existing social system and account fortraditional rites and customs’.19[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn19] In consequence, most publishedanalyses of myth all the way back to Sir James Frazer tend to focus on itssocial, economic and psychological functions. There have been a very few notableexceptions,20 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn20] but as a rulethose foolish enough to suggest that myths might in any way provide us withfactual historical data have been ridiculed, abused and in some caseseffectively excommunicated by their peers.21[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn21]As a non-scientist with no peers to excommunicate me, and as an author who earnshis own keep, I’m free to pursue any line of inquiry that I’m enlightened by andto find my own position on any matter. I have therefore often taken mythsseriously – with good reason I believe.In particular I have tried to show that the universal myth of the deluge simplycannot be accounted for intelligently by the usual fatuous dismissals ofprofessional mythologists, and that its manifestations again and again showremarkable correlations with what is known of the global meltdown at the end ofthe Ice Age. I can’t ‘prove’ my view that the flood myths are garbled memoriesof those events any more than the experts can ‘prove’ theirs that the floodmyths are a universal archetype of the foetus floating in the womb – orwhatever.22 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn22] Theirs is just atheory. Mine is just a theory. But time will tell which is right.Meanwhile, contrary to the orthodox line on these matters, I continue to lookupon the myths of the world as an archive of treasures, among which the mostprecious of all may be a kind of ‘history of prehistory’. It is not so in thecase of all myths, nor is it even necessarily so in the case of all flood myths.But my own experiences and research over many years – the research of a curiouslayman, not of a ‘scientific expert’ – have convinced me that the worldwidetestimony of cataclysm, flood, and geological and climatic change preservedwithin the human heritage of myth is a precious thing indeed and may be the onlymemory and record of any kind that our species has managed to preserve of thegreat and terrible events that overtook our ancestors at the end of the Ice Age.THE MANY FACES OF CATACLYSMOn a global scale these events were undoubtedly dominated by flooding -horrificfloods from the land to the sea as the great ice-sheets melted and theboundaries of glacial lakes gave way, and equally dreadful reverse floods, fromthe sea to the land, as the oceans inexorably swelled. But we saw in chapter 3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03] that flooding was only part of thestory. During the same 10,000-year epoch in which the ice melted and globalsea-level rose by 120 metres – roughly from 17,000 down to 7000 years ago – ourplanet also experienced dramatically increased volcanism, dramatically increasedfrequency and magnitude of earthquakes, and a dramatically unstable climate thatseesawed rapidly and unpredictably between extremes.Japan has no flood myth.Unlike so much of the rest of the blighted northern hemisphere Japan was nevercovered by an ice-cap – and even on the most northerly island of Hokkaido at thelast glacial maximum only the mountain ranges were glaciated.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn23] This means that no part of Japanand none of the ancient inhabitants of Japan ever found themselves in the way ofthe sort of terrifying meltwater floods, 50 or 100 metres high, that rolled outperiodically from the collapsing European and North American ice-sheets between17,000 and 7000 years ago – and scoured the lands across which they flowed.Moreover, although Japan’s surface-area was significantly reduced by risingsea-levels – with the most notable effect being the birth of the three islandsof Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu out of a single, much larger antediluvian island –a glance at the inundation maps reproduced in chapter 28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c28_r1.htm#c28] reveals that Japan was, in general,much less severely affected by post-glacial flooding than most other parts ofthe world. This was so, in the main, because its antediluvian coastlines werenaturally precipitous, with few low-lying plains of the kind that were rapidlyinundated (even by relatively minor sea-level rises) elsewhere in the region –for example around south-east Asia, where the Sunda Shelf was subjected torepeated catastrophic flooding, and in the basin between the Korean peninsulaand the present coast of China that is now filled by the Yellow Sea.Indeed, all in all it seems that we must regard Japan as having been a blessedland – as its mythology claims – throughout the rigours of the end of the IceAge. For not only was it sheltered by its own topography from the worst effectsof the post-glacial floods, but also it was screened from the most violentextremes of continental climate, thus enabling it to develop the lush andplentiful natural environment in which the Jomon could continue to pursue,across fourteen millennia, their near-idyllic lifestyle as affluenthunter-gatherers, fishermen, horticulturalists and, latterly, farmers.I therefore do not find it surprising that Japan has no indigenous flood myth.On the contrary, it is exactly what I would expect of Japanese mythology if itis rooted and grounded in the myth-memories of the Jomon (no matter howdisguised these may be beneath later influences). For what Japan actually lostduring the post-glacial floods of the Jomon era were its ‘beachfront properties’– including, I will endeavour to prove, several great coastal temples and sacredsites that now lie as much as 30 metres underwater. But it never lost its heartand soul to the rising seas nor was it ever smashed down to total destruction inthe way that other areas of the world were.Against such a background a strong flood myth would be anomalous.Yet Japan, though ‘blessed’ in so many ways, did not entirely escape theupheavals of the meltdown epoch. We know, for example, that even here -thoughmuch reduced in frequency – the wild post-glacial climate flips did have theireffects. Likewise, as was the case elsewhere around the world, we know that the10,000 years after the end of the Last Glacial Maximum were accompanied in Japanby greatly increased volcanism.I have seen evidence of the latter first-hand in early Jomon settlements such asUenohara on Kyushu, where the ancient habitation layers are interspersed withthick carpets of volcanic ash. Moreover, I think most archaeologistsspecializing in the Jomon period would agree that in general their tasks ofsequencing and stratigraphy are greatly facilitated by the presence of suchvolcanic layers in a great many Jomon sites around Japan.So if the Kojiki, the Nihongi and the other ancient Japanese texts do preserveimportant Jomon memories alongside the many later ingredients which we know theyalso include, then it would be reasonable to expect that some of those memoriesmight touch on the experience of volcanic and seismic cataclysms.All interpretation of myth is speculative – mine and everybody else’s. Butlisten to the story of the ‘ravages’ or ‘havoc’ of Sosano-wo-no-Mikoto, thegreat Kami-deity called Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male.THE HAVOC OF SOSANOThe story is set in the Age of the Gods – more than 10,000 years ago as thechronicles inform us.24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn24] Whetherby coincidence or because it is a memory of those times, this places it in themidst of the epoch of post-glacial tumult.We are to picture the storm god, Sosano. At this stage he is a young man ‘of afierce temper and a wicked disposition’ with ‘an eight-hands-length beard’.25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn25] He has been appointed to ruleover the ‘Plain of Ocean’26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn26] byhis father Izanagi but, adult though he is, he remains disconsolate at the deathof his mother Izanami many years before. Sosano will not accept her loss buthowls and rages, howls and rages, seeking to join her in the Land of Yomi:27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn27] ‘The fashion of his weeping wassuch as by his weeping to wither the green mountains into withered mountains andby his weeping to dry up all the rivers and seas.’28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn28]To restore cosmic harmony Izanagi intervenes, ordering Sosano to remove himselffrom the earth. Sosano replies that he will go down to the Land of Yomi to joinhis mother but that first he wants to ascend to the High Plain of Heaven to bidfarewell to his sister Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, the ‘Great-Sky-Shiner’:29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn29]When Sosano went up to Heaven, by reason of the fierceness of his divine naturethere was a commotion in the sea, and the hills and mountains groaned aloud.Amaterasu, knowing the violence and wickedness of this Deity, was startled andchanged countenance, when she heard the manner of his coming.30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn30]These are the words of the Nihongi. In the same vein the Kojiki tells us thatduring Sosano’s ascent ‘all the mountains and rivers shook, and every land andcountry quaked’.31 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn31] Likewise,both versions note alarming effects on the ‘countenance’ of the sun –Amaterasu’s hair stands out like a corona, or ‘in knots’, she winds ropes ofcurved magatama jewels around herself, she stamps her feet and sinks up to herthighs in the hard earth, which she kicks away ‘Like rotten snow’, and sheutters a mighty cry of defiance.32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn32]Sosano is offended:From the beginning my heart has not been black. But as in obedience to the sternbehest of our parents, I am about to proceed for ever to the Land of Yomi, howcould I bear to depart without having seen face to face thee my elder sister? Itis for this reason that I have traversed on foot the clouds and mists and havecome hither from afar. I am surprised that my elder sister should, on thecontrary, put on so stern a countenance.33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn33]Amaterasu is mollified and a temporary calm descends upon the world. The twodeities cooperate in the magical reproduction of further deities. But behind thescenes all is not well and Sosano’s troublesome nature is beginning to manifestagain. The end result is a cataclysm so great that the sun disappears entirelyfrom view. Here’s how the Nihongi tells the story:Sosano’s behaviour was exceedingly rude … When he saw that Amaterasu was aboutto celebrate the feast of first fruits, he secretly voided excrement in thepalace. Moreover, when he saw that Amaterasu was in her sacred weaving hall,engaged in weaving the garments of the Kami, he flayed a piebald colt of Heaven,and breaking a hole in the roof tiles of the hall, flung it in. Then Amaterasustarted with alarm, and wounded herself with the shuttle. Indignant at this, shestraightaway entered the Rock-cave of Heaven, and having fastened the Rock-door,dwelt there in seclusion. Therefore constant darkness prevailed on all sides,and the alternation of night and day was unknown.34[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn34]Most attempts by professional mythologists to explain this strange story arefounded on the alleged ‘primitive’ fear that ancient peoples supposedly feltaround the time of the winter solstice, during the shortest days of midwinter,that the sun would never return to its full power.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn35] Somehow Amaterasu’sdisappearance into the rock-cave is to be taken as a symbol of this seasonalanxiety (which apparently our ancestors were too stupid to overcome), while hereventual re-emergence is naturally thought to symbolize the renewal of growth asthe sun moves towards the spring equinox.This is neat and tidy but in my view nonsense. People born in seasonal climesdon’t need myths to tell them that winter will end! They know that already fromtheir own life experience, from the experience of their siblings, from theexperience of their parents. It’s obvious that fear is not the appropriatereaction to such a routine and predictable phenomenon. But fear is appropriatewhere terrible, infrequent and unpredictable disasters are concerned – disastersthat shake the earth, roil the sea and blot out the sun from the sky in theviolent and terrifying manner that the myths recount. It’s this sort ofreasonable fear, connected to the geological and climatic violence that Sosanorepresents, that I think is reflected in the story of his ‘ravages’ and of thedarkening of the sun.As usual the language of the Kojiki is slightly different from that of theNihongi and adds texture to the same tale. After Amaterasu has retired withinher cave and made fast its rock-door, we read:The whole Plain of High Heaven was obscured and all the Central Land ofReed-Plains darkened. Owing to this, eternal night prevailed. Hereupon thevoices of the evil36 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn36] Kami werelike unto the flies in the fifth moon as they swarmed, and a myriad portents ofwoe all arose.37 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn37]This sounds more like the end of the world to me than the winter solstice! Or ifnot in fact the end of the world, then something that obviously felt very muchlike it to those living at the time. Surely what the texts are asking us toenvisage here is not less than a sustained period of cataclysm during which thewhole land of Japan was plunged into ‘constant darkness’. And if so, then is itcoincidence, or because the texts contain a true report, that cataclysms of thismagnitude did occur in Japan during the meltdown of the Ice Age when earthquakesand volcanic activity were at their peak? Even the relatively puny volcaniceruptions of the modern era have been known to darken skies across whole regionsand provoke intimations of the end of the world.38[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn38] How much more likely it is thatthe multiple large-scale eruptions that Japan experienced in the Jomon era couldfrom time to time have combined their effects to produce a total blackout of theskies and real fears of the onset of ‘eternal night’.Even the longest volcanic winter does end, however. So as we would expect withsuch a scenario Amaterasu eventually does emerge from her rock-cave. She istempted forth by some wonderful commotion and trickery of her fellow Kami, whichneed not detain us here, and once again: ‘The radiance of the Sun Goddess filledthe universe.’39 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn39]But the story is not yet over. What is to be done with the rebellious Sosano,who caused all this trouble in the first place? The assembled Kami would havetheir revenge on him. He is fined heavily. His toenails and fingernails arepulled out. His beard is cut:After this the Kami upbraided Sosano, saying ‘Thy conduct has been in thehighest degree improper. Thou must, therefore, not dwell in Heaven. Nor mustthou dwell in the Central Reed-Plain Land. Thou must go speedily to the BottomNether Land [the Land of Yomi].’ So together they drove him away downwards.Now this was a time of continuous rains …40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn40]Remember that all interpretation of myth is speculative, but in summary, if westoryboard the ravages of Sosano, I suggest we get something like the following: 1. A period of extremely arid climate during which the ‘green mountains’ become ‘withered mountains’ and the rivers and seas dry up. Comment: a good, shorthand description of conditions at the Last Glacial Maximum, when global sea-level was at its lowest and north-east Asia, along with many other parts of the world, experienced thousands of years of extreme aridity.41 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn41] 2. A commotion in the sea; mountains and rivers shake and groan. Commerit: the meltdown has begun in earnest; as the earth’s crust readjusts under the changing stresses Japan experiences earthquakes of phenomenal intensity and its network of colossal volcanoes grows restless. 3. A change in the countenance of the sun: the episode of the piebald colt. Comment: atmospheric effects from increased volcanism. 4. The disappearance of the sun into the ‘Rock-cave of Heaven’. Comment: skies darkened and sun obscured by massive volcanic eruptions and prolonged local volcanic fallout combined with global circulation of ash in the upper atmosphere. 5. Return of the sun followed by a period of continuous rains. Comment: the sky clears, the sun is seen again; as the meltdown of the far-off ice-sheets continues and more water is made available for atmospheric circulation, global precipitation increases and Japan experiences heavy rains after a long period of drought.42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn42]So, yes, I am speculating. And, yes, I do realize that there might be dozens ofother far more worthy explanations. Yet Japan did pass through such conditionsat the end of the Ice Age.And the Jomon were there to experience them.THE LAND OF YOMISosano’s long-running story does not quite end even with his expulsion fromheaven. Contrary to the command of the assembled Kami, he has deeds to do onearth before he joins his mother Izanami in the Land of Yomi. Most of these aregood deeds and feature the killing of an eight-headed serpent-monster thatthreatens a damsel in distress and the recovery from its tail of anExcalibur-like sword.43 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn43] Afterhaving married the damsel and produced more children, ‘Sosano-wo-no-Mikoto atlength proceeded to the Land of Yomi.’44[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn44]This brings me back to the point at which I started this chapter – themysterious journey to the Underworld, to the enchanted island, to the Kingdom ofthe Sea King, that recurs in the Japanese myths.Sosano’s case touches only tangentially on the issue. It is the story of hismother, the great procreator goddess Izanami (She-Who-Invites) and of his fatherIzanagi (He-Who-Invites) that will lead us along the correct path. Izanami andIzanagi are the archetypal divine couple, progenitors of gods and men, whom wefirst encounter in the ancient texts standing on the ‘Floating Bridge ofHeaven’, gazing down into the swirling, oily, cloud-covered mass of the primevaluniverse in formation:Izanagi-no-Mikoto and Izanami-no-Mikoto stood on the Floating Bridge of Heaven,and held counsel together saying: ‘Is there not a country beneath?’Thereupon they thrust down the jewel-spear of Heaven, and groping abouttherewith found the ocean. The brine which dripped from the point of the spearcoagulated and became the island which received the name Ono-goro-Jima[’Spontaneously-congealed-island’; identified with a small island near Ahaji].The two Deities thereupon descended and dwelt in this island. Accordingly theywished to become husband and wife together, and to produce countries.So they made Ono-goro-Jima the pillar of the centre of the land.45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn45]It is impossible to pass such symbolism as ‘the pillar of the centre of theland’ without noting its obvious family resemblance to the notion of theomphalos or ‘navel-of-the-earth’, found as far afield as ancient Peru, EasterIsland, India, ancient Egypt and Greece. I have discussed this problem inearlier chapters and in another work,46[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn46] and will not repeat myself;still, the sense of an intrusion into the Nihongi’s text at this point of whatmany as well as myself believe to have been an international geodetic technicalterminology is overwhelming.As well as the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, and her troublesome brother Sosano,Izanagi and Izanami become the parents of many other children, several of whomare islands (perhaps even the islands of post-glacial Japan that were formed byrising sea-levels?), while others are Kami of every variety.In a curious episode, the first-born of the divine couple is described as aleech-child (later identified with the god Yebisu),47[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn47] whom ‘they straightaway placedin a reed boat and set adrift’.48[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn48] And just as Sosano’s killing ofthe serpent to rescue a damsel in distress recalls the Greek myth of Perseus andAndromeda, so too this story of a child set adrift in a reed vessel has bizarresimilarities to the stories of well-known civilizing heroes who were ‘saved fromwater’ in the same way – such as Moses in the Old Testament and Sargon the Greatof Mesopotamia, who claimed in the third millennium BC:My mother was a priestess. I did not know my father. The priestess, my mother,conceived me and gave birth to me in hiding. She placed me in a basket made ofreeds and closed the lid with pitch. She put the basket in the river … The rivercarried me away.49 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn49]Returning to the myths of Japan, the last of Izanami’s children is the fire-godKagu-tsuchi (Fire-Shining-Swift-Male).50[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn50] As he enters the world heruterus is burnt and soon afterwards she sickens, dies and her spirit travels tothe Land of Yomi.51 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn51]Now, another scene from universal myth unfolds – here powerfully reminiscent ofthe Underworld quests of Orpheus for Eurydice and of Demeter for Persephone.52[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn52] The ancient Japanese recensionof this mysteriously global story is given in the Kojiki and the Nihongi, wherewe read that Izanagi, mourning for his dead wife, followed after her to the Landof Yomi in an attempt to bring her back to the world of the living:Izanagi-no-Mikoto went after Izanami-no-Mikoto and entered the Land of Yomi … Sowhen from the palace she raised the door and came out to meet him, Izanagi spokesaying; ‘My lovely younger sister! The lands that I and thou made are not yetfinished making; so come back!’53[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn53]Izanami is honoured by Izanagi’s attention, and minded to return. But there isone problem. She has already eaten food prepared in the Land of Yomi and thisbinds her to the place, just as the consumption of a single pomegranate seedbinds Persephone to hell in the Greek myth.54[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn54]Is it an accident that ancient Indian myth also contains the same idea? In theKatha Upanishad a human, Nachiketas, succeeds in visiting the underworld realmof Yama, the Hindu god of Death (and, yes, scholars have noted and commentedupon the weird resonance between the names and functions of Yama and Yomi).55[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn55] It is precisely to avoiddetention in the realm of Yama that Nachiketas is warned:Three nights within Yama’s mansion stayBut taste not, though a guest, his food.56[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn56]So there’s a common idea here – in Japan, in Greece, in India – about not eatingfood in the Underworld if you want to leave. Such similarities can result fromcommon invention of the same motif – in other words, coincidence. They canresult from the influence of one of the ancient cultures upon the other two,i.e. cultural diffusion. Or they can result from an influence that has somehowpercolated down to all three, and perhaps to other cultures, stemming from an asyet unidentified common source.The parallel idea of not looking or not looking back after a successful quest inthe Underworld is strong in the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. In their caseEurydice, killed by a snakebite, is permitted to return to life after Orpheushas journeyed to the land of the dead to find her. But there is a condition:neither he nor she should look back as they depart the Underworld: ‘The coupleclimbed up toward the opening into the land of the living, and Orpheus, seeingthe sun again, turned back to share his delight with Eurydice. In that moment,she disappeared.’57 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn57]The Japanese recension passed down to us from unknown antiquity in the Kojikiand the Nihon Shoki is hauntingly different and yet hauntingly the same. Thereader will recall that Izanagi has reached the Land of Yomi and has justaddressed Isanami: ‘My lovely younger sister! The lands that I and thou made arenot yet finished making; so come back!’ And she has informed him that she haseaten food cooked in the Underworld and thus cannot depart: ‘My lord andhusband, why is thy coming so late? I have already eaten of the cooking furnaceof Yomi.’58 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn58] Nevertheless, shesays that she will return within and discuss the matter with the resident Kami.Perhaps an exception can be made and she can be freed. But she issues onewarning: ‘Look not at me!’59 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn59]She goes back into the palace to negotiate her freedom and remains there a longtime without giving any sign. Izanagi, waiting outside, becomes impatient. Heimprovises a torch and follows her within. There, unfortunately, the first thinghe sees is Izanami covered in putrefaction and seething with maggots:Izanagi-no-Mikoto was greatly shocked and said, ‘Nay! I have come unawares to ahideous and polluted land.’ So he speedily ran away back again. ThenIzanami-no-Mikoto was angry, and said: ‘Why didst thou not observe that which Icharged thee [i.e not to look at her]? Now am I put to shame.’60[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn60]Like a vengeful harpy, and accompanied by ‘the eight Ugly Females of Yomi’, shesets off in pursuit, determined to punish Izanagi for dishonouring her. Justahead of them he reaches ‘the Even Pass of Yomi’, the exit to the upper world,and blocks it behind him with ‘a thousand-men-pull rock’.61[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn61] This rock, we read, ‘is calledthe great Kami, Land-of-Night-Gate-Block’.62[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn62] On one side stands Izanami,permanently relegated to the Realm of Yomi. On the other stands Izanagi,He-Who-Invites, who still has tasks to complete and powerful Kami to create inthe upper world.Amongst the great Kami brought into being as he performs the necessary ablutionsand purifications after his journey are his children Amaterasu and Sosano – whomwe have met already and need say no more about here …THE ENCHANTED ISLANDI’ve suggested there is a theme running through Japanese myth of a love affair,a journey to a mysterious parallel realm, and a return to the world.The first example, the story of Izanami and Izanagi, is set in the distant epochthat the Kojiki and the Nihongi call the Age of the Gods. But the second examplethat I will cite, superficially very different, is set in the Age of the EarthlySovereigns. Here we read of a fisherman later revered as a deity named Urashima:He was handsome of feature … He went out alone in a boat to fish with hook andline. During three days and nights he caught nothing, but at length he caught aturtle of five colours. Wondering, he put it in the boat … While he slept theturtle suddenly became transformed into a woman, in form beautiful beyonddescription … He said to her, ‘This place is far from the homes of people, ofwhom there are few on the sea. How did you so suddenly come here?’ Smiling, shereplied, ‘I deemed you a man of parts alone on the sea, lacking anyone with whomto converse, so I came here by wind and cloud.’63[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn63]She is, of course, a Kami, as he quickly understands, from a magical land that‘lasts as long as sky and earth and ends with sun and moon’.64[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn64] And she tempts him:‘You can come to that region by a turn of your oar. Obey me and shut your eyes.’So presently they came to a broad island in the wide sea, which was covered withjewels. [On it was a great mansion.] Its high gate and towers shone with abrilliance which his eyes had never beheld and his ears had never heard tell.65[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn65]They enter the mansion and are received and greeted in a loving fashion by herparents: ‘Seated they conversed of the difference between mankind and theLand-of-Spirits, and the joy of man and Kami meeting.’66[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn66] Eventually the fishermanUrashima and the beautiful sea Kami are married. Thereafter: ‘For three years,far from his aged parents, he lived his life in the Spirit capital, when hebegan to yearn for his home and for them.’ Observing the change in him, his wifeasks: ‘Do you desire to return home?’He replies: ‘To come to this far Spirit Land, I parted from my near of kin. Myyearning I cannot help … I wish to return to my native place to see my parentsfor a while.’ Then we read:Hand in hand, they walked conversing … till they came to where their waysdiverged and where her parents and relatives, sorrowing to part with him, madetheir farewells. The princess informed him that she was indeed the turtle whichhe had taken in his boat, and she took a jewel-casket and gave it to him saying,‘If you do not forget me and desire to seek me, keep this casket carefully, butdo not open it.’ Thus he parted from her and entered his boat, shutting his eyesas she bade him.67 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn67]In a trice Urashima finds himself back in his home village again but a terriblesurprise awaits him. During the three years that he has spent enchanted on theSpirit island 300 mortal years have passed and everything has changed beyondrecognition. Stumbling around dazed and disconsolate, discovering from apasser-by that his own disappearance three centuries previously is itself nowthe subject of a village legend, he forgets the warning about the jewel box andopens it to remind himself of his Kami wife: ‘But before he could look into it,something in the form of a blue orchid soared up to the blue sky with the windand clouds. Then he knew that, having broken his oath, he could not go back andsee her again.’68 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn68]It is already apparent from the narrative that lines are blurred between theenchanted island and the Spirit Land of Yomi. But the blurring goes even furtherin another variant of the myth where the Kami princess is revealed as no lesserfigure than ‘the daughter of the Dragon King of the Sea’ and in which Urashimais taken not to an island but to an underwater kingdom.69[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn69]How do we explain such ambiguity? Perhaps it means nothing. But taken at facevalue what it seems to suggest is that the Mansions of the Sea King did notalways lie beneath the waves.THE KINGDOM OF THE SEA KINGThe same implication is there to be grasped in an earlier cycle of the myth alsofound in the Kojiki and the Nihongi and set in an era very near the end of theAge of the Gods – indeed just two generations before the birth of Jimmu-Tenno,part man, part Kami, the legendary first emperor of Japan.As the story unfolds we are introduced to two brothers. The elder isHo-no-susori no Mikoto (whose name is usually translated into English as‘Fire-Glow’ or Tire-Shine’) and the younger is Ho-ho-demi no Mikoto (‘Fire-Fade’or ‘Fire-Subside’). The Nihongi tells us, somewhat opaquely, that the former had‘a sea-gift’, while the latter had by nature ‘a mountain gift’.70[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn70] But the Kojiki makes mattersclearer:His Augustness Fire-Glow was a prince who got his luck on the sea, and caughtthings broad of fin and things narrow of fin. His Augustness Fire-Fade was aprince who got his luck on the mountains, and caught things rough of hair andthings soft of hair.71 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn71]In other words Fire-Glow, like Urashima, was a fisherman and Fire-Fade was ahunter – occupations that are very far indeed from the ‘fighting farmer’stereotype of Japan’s later Yayoi and Kofun cultures but that do reflect andidealize the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, always strongly dependent upon fishing,of the earlier Jomon period.72 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn72]As the Kojiki tells it, Fire-Fade the hunter persuaded Fire-Glow the fishermanthat they should ‘mutually exchange and use each other’s luck’.73[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn73] In practice this meant thatFire-Fade was to take Fire-Glow’s fish-hook and try his luck in the sea;Fire-Glow was to take Fire-Fade’s bow and arrows and try his luck as a hunter inthe mountains. Although Fire-Glow was not in favour of the scheme, ‘at last withdifficulty the mutual exchange was obtained’:74[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn74]Then His Augustness Fire-Fade, undertaking the sea-luck, angled for fish, butnever got a single fish; and moreover he lost his fish-hook in the sea.Thereupon His Augustness Fire-Glow asked him for the fish-hook, saying, ‘Amountain luck is a luck of its own, and a sea-luck is a luck of its own. Leteach of us now restore to the other his luck. To which the younger brother HisAugustness Fire-Fade replied, saying, ‘As for thy fish-hook, I did not get asingle fish by angling with it; and at last I lost it in the sea.’75[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn75]Fire-Glow had looked after and returned Fire-Fade’s bow and arrows76[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn76] and was insistent that hisfish-hook should likewise be returned – although ‘there was no means of findingit’.77 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn77] Hoping to settle thematter, Fire-Fade made a new hook, which he offered to his elder brother. ButFire-Glow refused to accept it and again demanded the old hook.78[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn78]So the younger brother, breaking his ten-grasp sabre that was augustly girded onhim, made of the fragments five hundred fish-hooks as compensation; but he wouldnot take them. Again he made a thousand fish-hooks as compensation; but he wouldnot receive them, saying: ‘I still want the real original fish-hook.’79[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn79]The Nihongi takes up the story:Fire-Fade’s grief was exceedingly profound and he went and made moan by theshore of the sea. There he met Shihi-tsutsu no Oji [’Salt-sea elder’]. The oldman inquired of him, saying, ‘Why dost thou grieve here?’ He answered and toldhim the matter from first to last. The old man said, ‘Grieve no more. I willarrange this matter for thee. So he made a basket without interstices, andplacing Fire-Fade in it, sank it into the sea …80[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn80]I introduced the mystery of Fire-Fade’s prehistoric diving adventure in chapterI because he soon comes to an underwater palace and because its description inthe Nihongi reminds me so much of the towering underwater ruins I have seen offthe island of Okinawa at Chatan and, 50 kilometres further to the west, atKerama. Here is the passage that first caught my attention:Forthwith he found himself at a pleasant strand, where he abandoned the basket,and, proceeding on his way, suddenly arrived at the Palace of the Sea God. Thispalace was provided with battlements and turrets, and had stately towers.81[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn81]Fire-Fade then loitered outside the gate until he was spotted by a beautifulprincess, the daughter of the Sea God, who arranged with her father that this‘rare stranger’ should be brought within. In the ensuing encounter the Sea Godquestioned Fire-Fade as to his purpose and the story of the lost fish-hook cameout:The Sea God accordingly assembled the fishes, both great and small, and requiredof them an answer. They all said, ‘We know not. Only the Red-woman has had asore mouth for some time past and has not come.’ She was therefore peremptorilysummoned to appear, and on her mouth being examined the lost hook was actuallyfound.82 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn82]Mission accomplished? Perhaps. But now that he had experienced the delights ofthe Sea God’s palace Fire-Fade did not want to leave. Instead he married the SeaGod’s daughter, Toyo-tama-hime, ‘and dwelt in the sea-palace’:83[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn83]For three years he enjoyed peace and pleasure, but still had a longing for hisown country, and therefore sighed deeply from time to time. Toyo-tama-hime heardthis and told her father, saying Fire-Fade often sighs as if in grief. It may bethat it is the sorrow of longing for his country.84[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn84]Fire-Fade admitted that this was so and the Sea God granted him permission toreturn to the world above the waves, handing over to him Fire-Glow’s fish-hookto take back and also gifting him with two magical jewels – ‘the jewel of theflowing tide and the jewel of the ebbing tide’ – with which he would be able tocontrol the waters.85 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn85] The planwas that he should use these jewels to punish and subdue his elder brother(presumably for being so unreasonable about the fish-hook in the first place):If thou dost dip the tide-flowing jewel, the tide will suddenly flow, andtherewithal thou shalt drown thy elder brother. But in case thy elder brothershould repent and beg forgiveness, if, on the contrary, thou dip the tide-ebbingjewel, the tide will spontaneously ebb, and therewithal thou shalt save him. Ifthou harass him in this way, thy elder brother will of his own accord rendersubmission.86 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn86]Before Fire-Fade set off on his journey he was approached by his young sea wifeToyo-tama-hime, who informed him that she was pregnant and that she would followhim soon – for she wished to bear his child above water, in his homeland:Thy handmaiden is already pregnant, and the time of her delivery is not far off.On a day when the winds and waves are raging, I will surely come forth to thesea shore, and I pray thee that thou will make for me a parturition house, andawait me there.87 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn87]After his return Fire-Fade, armed with the remarkable jewels that could raiseand lower sea-level at will, quickly subdued his elder brother, just as the SeaGod had promised. Then the time came for Toyo-tama-hime to fulfil her promiseand ascend from the underwater kingdom to give birth to their child on land. Soshe ‘bravely confronted the wind and waves, and came to the sea shore’ – whereFire-Fade awaited her.88 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn88]From the Kojiki:Unable to restrain the urgency of her womb she entered the parturition-hall.Then, when she was about to be delivered, she spoke to her husband, saying,‘Whenever a foreigner is about to be delivered, she takes the shape of hernative land to be delivered. So I now will take my native shape to be delivered.Pray look not upon me!’89 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn89]The Nihongi, too, repeats the same warning: ‘When thy handmaiden is in travail,I pray thee do not look upon her.’90[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn90] But of course, just as Orpheushad to look back at the gates of hell and just as Izanagi had to look at Izanamiin the Land of Yomi:Fire-Fade could not restrain himself, but went secretly and peeped in. NowToyo-tama-hime was just in childbirth and had changed into a dragon. She wasgreatly ashamed, and said, ‘Hadst thou not disgraced me I would have made thesea and land communicate with each other, and forever prevented them from beingsundered. But now that thou hast disgraced me, wherewithal shall friendlyfeelings be knit together?’ So she wrapped the infant in rushes, and abandonedit on the sea shore. Then she barred the sea-path and passed away.91[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn91]The sequel to this story is that the infant abandoned on the sea-shore grows upto wed his maternal aunt, sent from the underwater kingdom to care for him, andamong their offspring is Jimmu-Tenno, the first Emperor of Japan,92[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn92] founder of the imperial linethat survives to this day. In a sense, therefore, are we not to understand thatthe historical civilization of Japan, bound up with the line of the Emperor, isto be traced back through Jimmu-Tenno – by way both of his grandmother and hismother – not only to the lineage of Amaterasu and the great gods of theHigh-Plain of the Sky, but also to the lineage of the Sea God and to a kingdomof palaces and mansions that now lies beneath the sea?R’YUGUThe ambiguity in the story of Urashima’s enchanted island – which has itsometimes above and sometimes below the waves – also occurs in the story ofFire-Glow and Fire-Fade. For whereas the Nihongi has Fire-Fade descend to thesea-bed in a waterproof basket, the Kojiki has him make the journey above waterin ‘a stout little boat without interstices’. He is told: ‘Go on for some time.There will be a pleasant road; and if thou goest in the boat along that road,there will appear a palace built like fishes’ scales.’93[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn93] Likewise, later in the storywhen Fire-Fade is taking his leave he refers to the Sea God’s kingdom quiteexplicitly as an ‘island’, and the translator Basil Hall Chamberlain feelsobliged to explain: ‘The Sea-God’s dwelling is called an island because it isbeyond the sea.’94 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn94]Otherwise, the versions are virtually identical but in these curious differencesI wonder if we are seeing, once again, a before-and-after effect summarized intwo different layers of myth – in the earlier of which the Kingdom of the SeaGod is remembered as an island, in the later as an underwater sanctuary of wallsand palaces and mansions? In crude and simplistic terms, could it be a memorythat great structures with ‘turrets and tall towers of exceeding beauty’ oncestood above water but are now beneath the waves?That seemed like wild and unjustified speculation to me until I discoveredexactly where Japanese legends say that the Kingdom of the Sea God is to befound …It seems that its name is R’yugu, and that it lies hidden from the sight of mansomewhere amongst the Lu-Chu islands.95[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c26-ftn95][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_174_r1.jpg]‘X’ MARKS THE SPOTToday the Lu-Chu islands (the old Chinese name) are part of Japan and are betterknown as the Ryukyu archipelago (from the Japanese pronunciation). Thearchipelago consists of three separate island groups – the northernmost aroundOkinawa, including the Keramas and Aguni; then Miyako in the centre; finally theYaeyama group with Yonaguni in the extreme south-west.I suggest it is not a matter to be ignored that (a) Japan has a tradition ofspectacular underwater structures that may only be reached by diving; (b) thereare some indications of a memory that these structures were once above water; ©the tradition is clearly associated with a hunter-gathering and fishing culturethat idealizes much of what we know about the Jomon lifestyle in Japan after theend of the Ice Age and down to about 2000 years ago; (d) the tradition placesthe underwater structures amongst the Ryukyu islands; (e) divers in recent yearshave indeed observed a series of spectacular underwater structures in the Ryukyuislands – extending all the way from Yonaguni to Okinawa.It was time to go diving again."},{"pageContent":"27 / CONFRONTING YONAGUNIThe question was, or is still, is it and, if yes, to what extent is it made byman or overworked by man? This is the question.Dr Wolf Wichmann, geologist, Yonaguni, March 2001I was in Tokyo in 1996 when the photojournalist Ken Shindo showed me the firstimages I had ever seen of an awe-inspiring terraced structure, apparently aman-made monument of some kind, lying at depths of up to 30 metres off theJapanese island of Yonaguni at the remote south-west end of the Ryukyuarchipelago. This was the moment, if there ever was just one moment, when the‘Underworld’ quest began for me and when much that I had learned in previousyears in many different countries began to swing sharply into focus and makesense. I felt an immediate compulsion to explore the beautiful and mysteriousstructure that beckoned so alluringly from the photographs. And I realized thatit would rewrite prehistory if it could indeed be proved to be man-made.I described in chapter 1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01] how Santha andI learned to dive, and the remarkable synchronicities and good fortune thatbrought us to Yonaguni in March 1997 to begin a systematic programme ofunderwater photography and research there that was to continue until mid-2001. Ialso described some of the other rock-hewn underwater structures that we divedat with our Japanese colleagues at other locations in the Ryukyus – notably atKerama, Aguni and Chatan at the northern end of the archipelago.The most complex and intractable problem shared by all of these otherwise verydifferent structures is also the simplest and most obvious question that anyonemight wish to ask about them: were they shaped and carved by human hands orcould they have ended up looking the way they do as a result of naturalweathering and the erosive weapons of the sea? Though they have an importantrole to play, geologists are not the only people qualified to decide the answerto such a question. Likewise, though they too are indispensable, archaeologistscannot be the final arbiters. On the contrary, if ever a multi-disciplinaryapproach was called for then it is here! For, as I’ve tried to show in theprevious chapters, Japan confronts us with a prehistoric cultural andmythological context into which the rock-hewn structures fit snugly like themissing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. This context includes a clear tradition ofunknown antiquity -still manifest in the present day – in which huge rocks arecarved and rearranged amidst sacred natural landscapes. Since this is preciselythe puzzling and ambiguous aspect – part natural and part seemingly man-made –of the underwater structures scattered around the Ryukyu archipelago, it isfoolish and irresponsible to ignore the possibility of a connection.Yet it is equally foolish and irresponsible to ignore what geology andarchaeology have to say on the matter. So it is time, I think, to provide athorough reckoning.THE THREE GEOLOGISTSThree qualified geologists – Masaaki Kimura, Robert Schoch and Wolf Wichmann –have dived at Yonaguni, acquired first-hand experience of the underwaterstructures, and commented publicly on what they saw. So far as I know, they are,at the time of writing, the only geologists ever to have dived there. Therefore,when we speak of ‘geological opinion’ concerning the Yonaguni anomalies, it isimportant to be clear that we are referring to the work and ideas of just threemen who, moreover, do not agree with one another – so there is no consensus.Other geologists who have expressed views without diving at Yonaguni hardlyqualify to participate in the debate.Since there are grave issues at stake concerning our understanding of prehistoryand the story of human civilization I propose to devote the necessary space inthis chapter to an accurate summary of the views of the three main geologicalprotagonists.DR KIMURAThe doyen of the group, and in my view the hero of the Yonaguni saga for hisdetermination, persistence and refreshingly open-minded intellectual approach,is Dr Masaaki Kimura, Professor of Marine Geology at the University of theRyukyus in Okinawa. He and his students have completed hundreds of dives aroundthe main ‘terrace’ monument at Yonaguni as part of a long-term project in whichthey have thoroughly measured and mapped it, produced a three-dimensional model,taken samples of ancient algae encrusted on its walls for carbon-dating, andsampled the stone of the structure itself. Professor Kimura’s unequivocalconclusion, based on the scientific evidence, is that the monument is man-madeand that it was hewn out of the bedrock when it still stood above sea-level –perhaps as much as 10,000 years ago. The principal arguments that he putsforward in favour of human intervention are on the record and include thefollowing: 1. ‘Traces of marks that show that human beings worked the stone. There are holes made by wedge-like tools called kusabi in many locations.’ 2. ‘Around the outside of the loop road [a stone-paved pathway connecting principal areas of the main monument] there is a row of neatly stacked rocks as a stone wall, each rock about twice the size of a person, in a straight line.’ 3. ‘There are traces carved along the roadway that humans conducted some form of repairs.’ 4. ‘The structure is continuous from under the water to land, and evidence of the use of fire is present.’ 5. ‘Stone tools are among the artefacts found underwater and on land.’ 6. ‘Stone tablets with carving that appears to be letters or symbols, such as what we know as the plus mark “+” and a “V” shape, were retrieved from under water.’ 7. ‘From the waters near by, stone tools have been retrieved. Two are for known purposes that we can recognize, the majority are not.’ 8. ‘At the bottom of the sea, a relief carving of an animal figure was discovered on a huge stone.’1 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn1] 9. On the higher surfaces of the structure there are several areas which slope quite steeply down towards the south. Kimura points out that deep symmetrical trenches appear on the northern elevations of these areas which could not have been formed by any known natural process. 10. A series of steps rises at regular intervals up the south face of the monument from the pathway at its base, 27 metres underwater, towards its summit less than 6 metres below the waves. A similar stairway is found on the monument’s northern face. 11. Blocks that must necessarily have been removed (whether by natural or by human agency) in order to form the monument’s impressive terraces are not found lying in the places where they would have fallen if only gravity and natural forces were operating; instead they seem to have been artificially cleared away to one side and in some cases are absent from the site entirely. 12. The effects of this unnatural and selective clean-up operation are particularly evident on the rock-cut ‘pathway’ (Kimura calls it the ‘loop road’) that winds around the western and southern faces of the base of the monument. It passes directly beneath the main terraces yet is completely clear of the mass of rubble that would have had to be removed (whether by natural or by human agency) in order for the terraces to form at all.2 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn2]DR SCHOCHThe second geologist to dive at Yonaguni, Professor Robert Schoch of BostonUniversity, has vacillated tenaciously in his opinions – but I take this as asign of an open-minded scholar ever willing to revise his views in the light ofnew evidence. Thus, when we first dived there together in September 1997, he wassure that the structure was man-made.3[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn3] Within a few days, however, hehad changed his mind completely:I believe that the structure can be explained as the result of natural processes… The geology of the fine mudstones and sandstones of the Yonaguni area,combined with wave and current actions and the lower sea-levels of the areaduring earlier millennia, were responsible for the formation of the Yonagunimonument about 9000 to 10,000 years ago.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn4]A few days later, Schoch softened his position again:After meeting with Professor Kimura, I cannot totally discount the possibilitythat the Yonaguni monument was at least partially worked and modified by thehands of humans. Professor Kimura pointed out several key features that I didnot see on my first brief trip … If I should have the opportunity to revisit theYonaguni monument, these are key areas that I would wish to explore.5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn5]Schoch did have an opportunity to revisit the structure in the summer of 1998,carrying out several more dives there. Then in 1999, in an interview given tothe BBC science programme Horizon for a documentary attacking my work – and inthe same year in his own book Voices of the Rocks - he expressed what sound liketwo very different, even contradictory opinions about the structure. Here is therelevant section from the BBC Horizon transcript:Narrator: Yonaguni looked as if it could be a spectacular discovery and Hancockneeded corroboration. He invited the Boston University geologist Robert Schochto inspect the site. Professor Schoch has taken a keen interest in unorthodoxviews of the past and he welcomed the chance to examine the underwaterdiscovery. Schoch dived with Hancock several times at Yonaguni.Prof. Robert Schoch (Boston University): I went there in this case actuallyhoping that it was a totally man-made structure that was now submergedunderwater, that dated maybe back to 6000 BC or more. When I got there and I gotto dive on the structure I have to admit I was very, very disappointed because Iwas basically convinced after a few dives that this was primarily, possiblytotally, a natural structure … Isolated portions of it look like they’reman-made, but when you look at it in context you look at the shore features,etc., and you see how, in this case, fine sandstones split along horizontalbedding plains that gives you these regular features. I’m convinced it’s anatural structure.6 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn6]Well, that seems straightforward. But then here is what Schoch says in Voices ofthe Rocks:Possibly the choice between natural and human-made isn’t simply either/or.Yonaguni Island contains a number of old tombs whose exact age is uncertain, butthat are clearly very old. Curiously the architecture of the tombs is much likethat of the monument. It is possible that humans were imitating the monument indesigning the tombs, and it is equally possible that the monument was itselfsomehow modified by human hands. That is, the ancient inhabitants of the islandmay have partially reshaped or enhanced a natural structure to give it the formthey wished, either as a structure on its own or as the foundation of a timber,mud or stone building that has since been destroyed. It is also possible thatthe monument served as a quarry from which blocks were cut, following thenatural bedding, joint and fracture planes of the rock, then removed toconstruct buildings that are now long gone. Since it is located along the coastthe Yonaguni monument may even have served as some kind of natural boat dock foran early seafaring people. As Dr Kimura showed me, ancient stone toolsbeautifully crafted from igneous rock have been found on Yonaguni.Significantly, Yonaguni has no naturally exposed igneous rocks, so the tools, orat least the raw materials from which they were made, must have been importedfrom neighbouring islands where such rock is found. The tools could have beenused to modify or reshape the natural stone structures now found underwater offthe coast of Yonaguni. The concept of a human-enhanced natural structure fitswell with East Asian aesthetics, such as the feng shui of China and theZen-inspired rock gardens of Japan. A complex interaction between natural andhuman-made forms that influenced human art and architecture 8000 years ago ishighly possible.7 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn7]As further evidence for a very ancient human role in the construction of theYonaguni monument, Schoch then sets out an argument of mine, advanced in my 1998book Heaven’s Mirror, that the structure is not only man-made but could alsohave served a specific astronomical function – since calculations show thataround 10,000 years ago, when it was above water, it would have stood on theancient Tropic of Cancer.8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn8] WritesSchoch:The ancients, I suspect, knew where the tropic was, and they knew that … itsposition moved slowly. Since Yonaguni is close to the most northerly positionthe tropic reaches in its lengthy cycle, the island may have been the site of anastronomically aligned shrine.9 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn9]In summary, therefore, Schoch has not come down definitively either on one sideof the fence or on the other but seems to be wavering in the direction of acompromise in which the structure is both natural and man-made at the same time.I cannot avoid adding that all rock-hewn structures, whether the weird terracedgranite outcrop at Qenko near Sacsayhuaman in Peru,10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn10] or the wonders of Petra inJordan, or the temples of Mahabalipuram in south India are, by definition partlynatural – the base rock out of which they are hewn – and partly man-made. Theycan’t help but be anything else.DR WICHMANNThe third geologist, German science writer Dr Wolf Wichmann, has definiteopinions and expresses them with certainty. In 1999 he informed Der Spiegelmagazine – who had taken him to Yonaguni – that he regards the underwatermonument as entirely natural. He made just three dives on the main terraces andthen declared: ‘I didn’t find anything that was man-made.’11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn11] Japan’s marine scientists‘haven’t got a clue’ what the terraced underwater structure at Yonaguni is,reports Der Spiegel:‘It is unlikely to be anything natural,’ said the oceanographer Teruaki Ishiifrom Tokyo. Masaaki Kimura, a marine researcher at the Ryukyus University(Okinawa) talks about ‘a masterpiece’. He thinks the structure is a sacrededifice built by a hitherto unknown culture possessing advanced technicalabilities.The debate going on in the Orient has awakened the curiosity of the West. Peoplewith second sight find themselves magically attracted by Iseki Point (‘ruins’).At the beginning of 1998 the geologist Robert Schoch, who believes the Sphinxwas built by the people of Atlantis [sic - completely untrue; Schoch does notbelieve any such thing], swam down to the site and declared it to be ‘mostinteresting’. The guru of ancient antiquity and best-selling author GrahamHancock was also investigating the site. After an excursion in a submersible herecords that at the base of the monument can be seen a ‘clearly defined path’.[Actually I have never been in a submersible at Yonaguni and I do not considermy four years of hands-on diving there as any kind of excursion; there is,however, a clearly defined path at the base of the monument.]The rock expert Wolf Wichmann could not corroborate these conclusions. In thecompany of a team from SPIEGEL TV he returned to explore the coastal area, underthreat from tsunamis. In a total of three diving operations he gathered rocksamples and measured the steps and ‘walls’. He was unconvinced by his findings:‘I didn’t find anything that was man-made.’During the inspection it was revealed that the ‘gigantic temple’ is nothing butnaturally produced bedded rock. The sandstone is traversed by vertical cracksand horizontal crevices. Perpendicularity and steps have gradually developed inthe fracture zones. The plateaux at the top are referred to by Wichmann astypical ‘eroded plains’. Such flat areas occur when bedded rock is located rightin the path of the wash of the waves.Suggestive pictures rich in detail and contrast may indeed reveal somethingelse, but in general the mass of rock looks like a structure rising out of asandy bed, with no sign of architectural design. The plateaux have gradientsections, and there is no perpendicular wall. Some of the steps just endnowhere; others are in a spiral, like steep hen-roosts.The stony blocks show no signs of mechanical working. ‘Had the “ashlars” beenhewn by tools, they would have been studded with flutes and cuts and scratches,’said Wichmann. Three circular recesses on the topmost plateau, referred to byKimura as column foundations, are nothing but ‘potholes’. These occur when waterwashes through narrow spaces.Facts like these fail to stem the current epidemic of mystery-fever. TheYonaguni monument has for some time played a key role in the world picture ofarchaeological dreamers.12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn12]THE ONE ARCHAEOLOGISTOne archaeologist has dived at Yonaguni and studied its underwater structuresfirst-hand. Others in his profession who have commented have done so from theirdesks after browsing through photographs or looking at videotape of thestructures. As is the case with the armchair geologists, their opinions can onlybe of limited value until they have dived there themselves. By contrast theopinion of the only experienced marine archaeologist in the world who has everdived at Yonaguni must count for a great deal more.That archaeologist – whose official report is reproduced in part below – isSundaresh from the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa, India. The readerwill recall that we dived with him and other NIO archaeologists at Dwarka inMarch 2000 and again at Poompuhur in February 2001. Between these expeditions inIndia, Sundaresh participated with us in an expedition to Yonaguni in September2000 that had been supported once again (as had Robert Schoch’s visit inSeptember 1997) by Seamen’s Club.Also participating in the September 2000 expedition was Kimiya Homma, abusinessman from Hokkaido, whose firm owns two very useful high-tech ROVs(remotely operated vehicles) for unmanned exploration in water too deep to bereadily reached by divers. So that an effective search for further structuresaround Yonaguni could be mounted in the short time available, Homma had broughtone of the ROVs with him and also an expert team of support staff and technicaldivers.Because it is a unique document of reference, being – so far – the first andonly evaluation of a wide range of Yonaguni’s underwater structures by a marinearchaeologist, I reproduce below several sections from Sundaresh’s expeditionreport. Some of the specific submerged sites that we visited with Sundareshduring the expedition are not yet familiar to the reader from the brief accountgiven in chapters 1 and 25 but will be described shortly:THE STUDY OF SUBMERGED STRUCTURES OFFYONAGUNI ISLAND OF JAPAN:THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM RECENT EXPEDITION1–12 September 2000BY SUNDARESH NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHYDONA PAULA, GOA 403 004DECEMBER 20001.0 IntroductionYonaguni is the most south-western island of Japan and closest to Taiwan (about69 nautical miles). This island is almond shaped with 10 km length (from east towest) and 4 km width (north to south). An international expedition was organizedby the Seamen’s Club, Ishigaki, Japan to further explore the underwaterstructures in the area. This report describes the archaeological significance ofthe structures found during the expedition.2.0 Background information of the areaUnderwater massive structures were found initially by Mr Aratake, a localresident of Yonaguni island during 1986–87. He named this point as Iseki(‘Monument’) Point. He was looking for hammerhead sharks schooling around theisland when a massive man-made underwater structure was noticed at a depth of 30m. This was his first discovery. Later more monuments were found by Aratake andother divers in nearby Tatigami and ‘Palace’ areas.4.0 Methodology4.1 Offshore explorationsTwo boats were chartered for explorations off Yonaguni waters from 2 September2000 to 8 September 2000. The Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) was deployedsimultaneously with side-scan sonar and echosounder. The ROV was operated withgenerator power supply. The system was operated in waters between 40 to 80metres depth around Yonaguni. The survey revealed a rock-cut channel about I mwide and more than 20 m long at 2 sea mounts. The ROV observations wereconfirmed by diving.5.0 Results5.1 Terraceda structure and canalA large terraced structure of about 250 metres long and 25 metres height wasstudied south of the Arakawabana headland. Known locally as Iseki Point, theterraced structure is bound to the northern side of an elongated, approximatelyeast-west trending structure, designated by Professor Masaaki Kimura, Universityof the Ryukyus, as an approach road. But our observation of the proposedroad-like structure suggests that it is more likely to be a canal. The overallwidth of the terraced structure is around 100 m. From each of the terraces, astaircase leads downwards to the canal (road?).The length of the canal appears to be more than 250 m, while the canal has awidth of 25 m. The purpose or utility of this canal structure is intriguing. Ourobservation all along the canal indicates that the western end of the structurebegins underwater opening away from the terraced structure into the open sea.The width, height and terraced northern side of the canal force us to suggestthat the canal structure might have served as a channel for small boatscommunicating with the Arakawabana headland. The southern natural outcrop wallprobably had provided a buffer wall for strong open sea waves. Thisinterpretation appears quite reasonable because the height of the southern wallof natural outcrop and the northern terraced wall are nearly same. The terracesand attached staircases might have been used for handling, loading and unloadingboats sailing through the channel. Thus it appears in all probability that theterraced structure and canal might have served as a jetty before submergence topresent depth.5.2 Monolith human headA large monolith that looks like a human head with two eyes and a mouth wasstudied at Tatigami Iwa Point. A human-cut large platform in the same monolithextends outwards at the base of the head. An approach way leads to this platformfrom the shore-side.The surrounding basal platform is quite large (about 2500 m2), and could easilyhave accommodated more than two thousand persons sitting. The human head andassociated platform with an approach road are suggestive of an area of worshipor community gatherings.5.3 Underwater cave areaDiving operations revealed caves at 8 to 10 m water depth at ‘Palace’ area. Theentry to these caves was possible only through the large 1 metre radius holes onthe cave roof. Inside the cave a boulder about 1 metre diameter engraved withcarvings was observed. About 100 m towards the eastern side of the caves morerock engravings were noticed on the bedrock. These rock engravings are believedto be man-made.Once upon a time these caves were probably on the land and were later submerged.The rock engravings inside the cave and on the bedrock were probably carved outby means of a tool of some sort. However, it is very difficult to say that theseare rock art of this or that period, or a script.5.4 Megaliths PointDiving operations revealed two big rectangular blocks measuring 6 metres inheight, about 2.5 metres in width (both) and 4.9 metres thickness which havebeen located towards the western side of Iseki Point … These rectangular blocksare designated by Japanese workers as megaliths. These blocks have been locatedin between two natural rock outcrops. The approach way to these megaliths isthrough a tunnel measuring about 3 m long, 1 m high and 1 m width.The shape, size and positioning of these megaliths suggest that they areman-made. It is believed that the people of Japan’s extremely ancient Jomonculture used to worship stones, rocks (Hancock, personal communication, 2000).In light of this practice, it may be worthwhile to suggest that these megalithsmight have been used as objects of worship. However, a thorough investigation inthis regard is necessary before assigning a definite purpose to these megaliths.6.0 ConclusionThe terraced structures with a canal are undoubtedly man-made, built by cuttingan existing huge monolithic outcrop. The rectangular terraced structure andcanal probably might have served as a jetty for handling, loading/unloadingsmall boats before its submergence to present depth.The monolith rock-cut human head and associated platform might have served as anarea of worshipping or community gatherings.THE SCORE SO FARBy my count so far I have one marine archaeologist, Sundaresh, who is convincedthat the Yonaguni structures are ‘undoubtedly man-made’, and who represents 100per cent of all the archaeologists who have ever dived there up to the time ofwriting. I also have one marine geologist, Masaaki Kimura, who believes the samething, a second geologist, Robert Schoch, who is undecided, and a third, WolfWichmann, who is convinced that they are natural.I decided when I got the opportunity that I should try to dive at Yonaguni withWichmann and see if I could change his mind. To this end, a few months after theDer Spiegel article appeared, I made the following statement on my website:I would like to offer a challenge to Wolf Wichmann … Let us agree a mutuallyconvenient time to do, say, twenty dives together at Yonaguni over a period ofabout a week. I will show you the structures as I have come to know them, andgive you every reason … why I think that the monuments must have been worked onby human beings. You will do your best to persuade me otherwise. At the end ofthe week let’s see if either side has had a change of mind.13[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn13]‘JAPANESE SCIENTISTS CANNOT DIVE …’In March 2001, on a mini-expedition funded by Channel 4 Television, Wichmanntook up my challenge. A small, wiry, dark-haired, unpretentious man, I liked himthe moment I met him, and continued to do so throughout the week that we spentdiving in Japan and arguing, in a mood of amiable disagreement, about what wewere seeing underwater.Predictably we did not reach a consensus: Wolf left Yonaguni still holding mostof the opinions with which he had arrived, and so did I. But I think that weeach gave the other some worthy points to ponder. I know that I benefited fromwhat amounted to a very useful field seminar on the natural history of submergedrock and began to understand clearly for the first time exactly how and why ageologist might conclude that the Yonaguni underwater structures are entirelynatural – or at any rate (to sum up Wolf’s position more accurately) that theyall could have been formed by known natural forces with no necessity for humanintervention.Before going on to Yonaguni, Wolf and I paid a visit to Professor Masaaki Kimuraat his office in the University of the Ryukyus. I started the ball rolling witha general question for Professor Kimura concerning the age of the structure:GH: People can argue for the next five centuries about whether what we seeunderwater at Yonaguni is man-made or artificial. But one thing which we canhopefully get clear is how old it is … when it was submerged? So the firstquestion I want to ask you is what is your view of the age of this structure?The last time that it was above water?Kimura: This construction has been submerged since 6000 years ago, because thecoralline algae attaching to the wall of this structure shows 6000 years.GH: And those coralline algae, because they’re organic, you’ve been able tocarbon-date them?Kimura: Yes, carbon 14.GH: Right. So that tells us the age of that biological item … it’s 6000 yearsold and it’s attached to a stone structure which, therefore, must be older thanthat.Kimura: It must be older, and so in general 6000 years ago the sea-level at thattime [was lower] … So if this was made by men, this must be when this area wasland … it’s about 9000 or 10,000 years ago.GH: 9000 or 10,000 years ago? So – again to clarify, because I need to get thisstraight – you’re saying that 9000 or 10,000 years ago, the whole area was abovewater and the date of submergence would be about 6000 years ago?Kimura: Before 6000 years ago.GH: This is the problem with carbon 14, isn’t it? It dates the organism, not thestructure. So then you can only say that the structure is older than that, buthow much older is not sure. How much work have you done on sea-level change as adating guide? And how big a factor is the possibility of sudden, maybe recentland subsidence as a result of earthquake?Kimura: Yes, I’m looking for such evidence, that is, geological evidence, butthere is no evidence of movement. If this area had subsided by movement it wouldbe due to earthquakes and faulting, but there is no active fault near by, thefringing coast is continuous, and between the beach and Iseki Point, there is nodiscontinuity or fault.Wolf: I see.GH: That makes things fairly clear, then. It leaves us with the sea-level issueon its own to base a date on, without complicating factors, which is great. Atleast we can be clear on one thing.Wolf: I think that questions for sea-level rise are very fairly proved byscientific evidence here in the area. I mean, they’re experts in their field.GH: So you’d have no problem with the 9000 year date?Wolf: No, no … not at all. No, the question was, or is still, is it and, if yes,to what extent is it made by man or overworked by man? This is the question.GH: Well hopefully we’ll get a chance to investigate that when we go toYonaguni.Kimura: We need to research much more.Wolf: Yes.GH (speaking to Prof. Kimura): I mean you’re practically the only person who’sdone – you and your team here – have done continuous research for some years.But almost nobody else is working on it, I think, at the moment?Kimura: Japanese scientists cannot dive.‘A VERY FINE, A VERY NICE THING …’Throughout our discussion Professor Kimura strongly maintained his commitment tothe man-made character of Yonaguni’s underwater monuments – not simply on thebasis of his technical findings, cited earlier, which I need not repeat here,but also, and I found persuasively, because: ‘This kind of topography – if thishas been made by nature it is very difficult to explain the shape.’Wolf’s riposte was immediate: ‘So what I would say to that formation is thatI’ve seen many natural formations, especially coastlines, being worked out bywaves and wind, especially with the help of weapons, erosive weapons – sand andso on … Seeing with the eye of a geologist or a morphologist it is, OK, a veryfine, a very nice thing, but possibly made by nature.’I asked Wolf whether in fact he had ever seen anything like the Yonaguni‘formation’ anywhere else in the world.‘Not in that exact combination,’ he replied. ‘This is what is surprising me;it’s a very strong, compressed combination of the different shapes and thedifferent figures you can find naturally in the world somewhere.’‘But you don’t usually find them in combination like this?’‘No, I haven’t seen that. So that is a marvel. It is a very beautifulformation.’‘Or the work of human beings?’ I prompted.‘Or of that. So that’s what we’re here for.’THE RAMPOn our first dive at Yonaguni I took Wolf to a very curious structure that I haddiscovered in late June 1999. It stands in 18 metres of water 100 metres to thewest of the terraces of the main monument. When it was above sea-level 8000 or10,000 years ago I suggest that it was originally a natural and untouched rockyknoll rising about 6 metres above ground level. A curving sloped ramp 3 metreswide was then cut into the side of the knoll and a retaining wall to the fullheight of the original mound was left in place enclosing and protecting theoutside edge of the ramp.I led Wolf to the base of the ramp, and as we swam up it I pointed out how theouter curve of the inner wall – which rises 2 metres above the floor of the rampand is formed by the body of the mound – is precisely matched by the inner curveof the outer wall, which also rises to a height of 2 metres above the rampfloor, so that both walls run perfectly parallel. Moreover, when we swam up andover the rim of the outer wall we could see that its own outer curve againexactly matches the curves within and that it drops sheer to the sea-bed – as itshould if it is indeed a purposeful wall and not simply a natural structure.I showed Wolf that the ramp floor itself, though battered and damaged in places,must originally have had a smooth, flat surface. I also showed him what Ibelieve may have been the function of the ramp. As one continues to follow itround it leads to a platform offering an impressive side-on view of the two hugeparallel megaliths, tucked into an alcove in the north-west corner of the mainmonument, that constitute a spectacular landmark in the Yonaguni ‘underworld’.Later we discussed what we’d seen:GH: OK, Wolf, the first dive we did I brought you to a structure [attempts todraw ramp structure on notepad) – I’m sorry, I’m hopeless at drawing …Wolf: Me too … (peers at drawing) OK, so I recognize it.GH: Hey, you’re a geologist, you should be able to draw. [Continues drawing.)And here is a rather nice wall going round on both sides, and in the middle is abedrock channel or ramp. And it rises from here around to this corner and, infact, if we follow it all the way round it leads us to a view of the megaliths.Now this wall is not a bank. It is a wall. It’s actually about half a metrewide. And it’s high … more than 2 metres high …Wolf: Round about.GH: … Above this … above this ramp, whatever you want to call it. So I simplycannot understand the combination of clean bedrock here (indicates the rampfloor), admittedly very eroded and damaged, but clean bedrock here, and theseheavily overgrown walls, which are definitely wall-like in appearance and ratherhigh in the sense that they have an outer and an inner edge, and the curve ofthe outer edge matches the curve of the inner edge; and the same on the otherwall.To my surprise Wolf immediately admitted that this rather innocuous-looking andonly recently discovered structure, which he had not been shown on his previousvisit, was a ‘real challenge’. He was later to describe it as ‘the mostimpressive thing’ he had seen at Yonaguni:The most impressive thing for me was the wall, the wall which is totally coveredby living organisms nowadays, which should be removed to have a look at thestructure of that wall, which can also be explained as having been done possiblyby nature, but to get it sure we have to do deep research on that.14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn14]Nevertheless Wolf would not have been Wolf if he had not at least attempted tocome up with a calm, level-headed and unsensational geological explanation forthe problem. He therefore drew my attention now to a place on land on Yonagunicalled Sananudai that we had taken a look at the day before where he had shownme wall-like formations – admittedly only half a metre high – that had beenformed entirely naturally:Wolf: OK, this is a real challenge to solve. But if you remember, the day beforewe have been on a platform on land – I forgot the name of the point –GH: Sananudai?Wolf: Right, correct. And by chance we went further down near the sea, and Ishowed you these encrustation patterns and maybe you remember that I …GH: I remember distinctly; you told me that a hard patina formed on the outsideof the rock and that the water softened out the inside, leaving a wall-likeshape in place.Wolf: Correct. And on the other side the relatively soft sandstone had alreadybegun to be removed. So … and I told you that this could be a possible way thata wall can be made by nature … OK, it’s a theory.GH: It’s a theory. I mean, what I saw at Sananudai was actually no curved wallsrunning in parallel with each other, but rather straight, and they were abouthalf a metre high.Wolf: They were at the beginning stage. Right. And if you had a look closerdown, you would have seen that there was a little curving, not as clear as this,I have to admit. But I mean, that was really the beginning stage so we don’tknow.GH: So would you want to explain those walls [on either side of the ramp] thatway, as a hard patina which was preserved, and the soft part was cut out?Wolf: At first, and then subsequently overgrown by organisms as we saw. But toget clear what that really is, so I underline repeatedly, it is a challenge, andthis is the first and only explanation I have for this. But to really get clearof this fact, we should have to remove the encrustation on one spot, or justfrom top to the bottom … This is the only way to find out of what material thiswall consists – there’s no other way; or to drill a hole through … We areobliged to find out what these walls are made of. Are they made of singlepatterns like stones or something?GH: Well, see, I don’t … I very much doubt if the walls will turn out to be madeof blocks. I think they’ll turn out to be cut. I think we’re looking atmegalithic culture which cut rock. I think they cut down into the living rock,and they created the walls by cutting, and then later on the encrustation cameand grew on top of the walls. That’s my theory.Wolf: I mean, if this was the case, then it would still be very useful to have alook on the core of these. It would tell us exactly what sort of material it was– was it soft sandstone, was it hard mudstone, or what else? And we would bepossibly able to find any marks on them, which then would give us the clearproof …GH: So what we have here is a bit of a puzzle which needs some serious researchdone on it.Wolf: Correct. That’s what I would say.THE TUNNEL AND THE MEGALITHSOn our second dive we visited the twin megaliths, weighing approximately 100tonnes each, stacked side by side like two huge slices of toast in a west-facingalcove in the north-west corner of the main monument. As noted earlier, a primeside-on view of these hulking rectangular blocks unfolds from the top of thecurved sloping ramp explored on the first dive. And we’ve seen that the rampappears to have been cut down (either by natural or human forces) between twoparallel walls out of a pre-existing rocky knoll.The knoll in turn co-joins other massive, heavily overgrown structures presumedto be outcrops of natural bedrock which form an almost continuous barricade, 3metres high and 5 metres thick, thrown out in a loose semi-circle in front ofthe megaliths – all at roughly 15–18 metres water depth. The barricade ispenetrated at only one point, and there only by a narrow tunnel a little over ametre wide and about a metre and a half high through which a scuba diverswimming horizontally may pass comfortably.The tunnel itself looks ‘built’ – as opposed to rock-hewn like so much else atYonaguni – in the sense that each of its sides consists of two courses of hugeblocks separated by straight, clearly demarcated, matching joints. There isinsufficient room to stand up within the tunnel, indeed barely enough even tocrouch, so when it was above water 8000 or 10,000 years ago any human enteringit would have been obliged to crawl through to the other side. What is striking,then, as soon as you emerge, is the way in which you now find yourself directlyopposite and beneath the twin megaliths which, from this angle, rear edge-onabove you, are like the paired sarsens at Stonehenge or the pair of uprightgranite megaliths worshipped since antiquity in Japan’s Ena region as ‘thesacred rock deity, the object of worship’ (see chapter 25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c25_r1.htm#c25]).The swim ahead to the base of the megaliths is a matter of 20 metres and youobserve immediately at this point that they do not stand on the sea-bed but areelevated about 2 metres above it, with their bases resting on a platform ofboulders, and framed in a cleft. The side of the cleft to your right is formedby the rear corner of the main terraced monument; the side to your left isformed by a lower ridge of rock which also shows signs, though to a lesserdegree, of terracing. Both megaliths slope backwards at the same angle againstthe cleft and both are the same height (just over 6 metres). The megalith to theright is distinctly thicker than its otherwise near ‘twin’ to the left. Bothmegaliths taper at top and bottom so that the gap between them, about the widthof a fist at the midpoint, is not constant. Although roughened, eroded andpitted with innumerable sea-urchin holes, the megaliths can still be recognizedas essentially symmetrical blocks, all the faces of which appear originally tohave been smoothed off to match – although, again, whether the process thatbrought about this effect was entirely natural, or at some point involved theinput of human skill and labour, remains thus far a matter of a very fewcontradictory professional opinions and no facts.I allowed myself to float up, towards the surface, along the slope of themegaliths, resting my hand in the gap between them as a guide. The light wasgood and I could see right into the gap; looking back at me from the farrecesses a plump red fish eyed me with horror and hoped that I would go away.As I neared the top of the megaliths, submerged under just 5 metres of water, Ibegan to feel the ferocious wash of waves pounding against the surroundingrocks. I clung on and for a few moments allowed my body to be tugged back andforth by the swell. Enshrouded in a cloud of foam I could see the north-westcorner of the main monument still rising above me the final few metres towardsthe surface.After the dive Wolf and I again discussed what we had seen and quite soon, aftersome fruitless trading of opinion, our argument began to focus around a single –potentially decisive – issue. Had these very striking parallel megaliths beenquarried, shaped and lowered into position beside the north-west corner of themain monument by human beings? Or had they arrived there through wholly naturalprocesses?I had drawn another rough sketch map to which I now pointed:GH: There’s the two blocks, and we see above them here, not very high abovethem, the mass of the structure which leads round to Iseki Point.Explain to me how those blocks got there.Wolf: OK. You have seen lots of blocks fallen down —GH: All over the place.Wolf: On the shoreline we saw from the ship —GH: Many fallen blocks, yes.Wolf: – lots of blocks have fallen down from higher parts —GH: Agreed.Wolf: - from beddings which have been broken, which were harder than theunderlying layers; because what happens is that you get an undercurving andundercutting of softer material under harder banks. So in my belief, these twoblocks have been once one block of two sandstone banks, with either softermaterial in between or nothing in between, just only the bedding limits.GH: Well, I want to know how they got where they are now.Wolf: OK. My opinion is that these blocks have fallen down from a very, veryhigh level, relative to their present situation.GH: But no high point overlooks them. You would have to go back -Wolf: Nowadays.GH: Well, yes, fair enough, nowadays. Nowadays you would have to go back in anorthward direction some 50 or 60 metres, maybe more, horizontally, before youreached the cliff.Wolf: Right, that’s clear for nowadays. I’m talking about a time-range of atleast 10,000 years … maybe more.GH: That we agree on.Wolf: So then there could have been places of a higher position from which thesestones could have fallen down.GH: So you are hypothesizing a pre-existing higher place from which these fell?Wolf: What I’m hypothesizing is that they have fallen down, so … and this musthave happened from a, let’s say, sufficiently higher place. So what this may bethen —GH: Do you agree with me that this place [indicates top of north-west corner ofmain monument 3–4 metres above top of megaliths) is not sufficiently high? Theplace we see immediately above it now?Wolf: I don’t have it in mind clearly, so I just can imagine from —aGH: But do you remember when we came to the top of these columns, of theseblocks, we were coming close to the surface. You could feel the swell hittingyou quite hard and the foam above your head very strong. In fact, it’s likelooking into clouds almost. And you can see the mass of the rock above you,probably not more than another 4 metres above, and you’re going to hit thesurface there.Wolf: Yes, I would think this would not be high enough.GH: No?Wolf: No.GH: So we need a hypothetical high place to do it?Wolf: Yes.GH: And I, of course, need a hypothetical civilization -Wolf: Yes.GH: – capable of moving it here.Wolf: Yes, of course, yes, yes … no doubt about itGH: So we have two hypotheticals there.Wolf: I’m not going to discuss any presence or absence of any civilization,because that’s not my field …But the problem I feel – and shall continue to feel – is that the very oddcombination of major stone structures lying underwater at Yonaguni, and the veryodd combinations of characteristics found within every one of those structures,simply cannot be said to have been properly evaluated until the possible‘presence or absence’ of a civilization – specifically the Jomon – has been verythoroughly taken into account.THE PATH AND THE TERRACESOur third and fourth dives were spent examining the ‘pathway’ or ‘loop road’which runs along the base of the main monument directly beneath the terraces inits south face at a depth of 27 metres; and the terraces themselves, which begin14 metres vertically above the pathway.THE TERRACESAt this level a spacious patio about 12 metres wide and 35 metres in lengthopens out and in its north-eastern corner, at depths decreasing from 13 metresto 7 metres, the structures known to local divers as ‘the terraces’ are found.There are two main ‘steps’, both about 2 metres high with sharp edges and cleannear-right-angle corners. Above them there are then three further smaller stepsgiving access to the top of the monument which continues to rise northwardsuntil it comes close to the surface.Here, very clearly, I could see the basis for the argument advanced by Wolf inDer Spiegel that the whole mass of the structure – with all its striking andemphatic terraces and steps, its perpendicular and horizontal planes – could beexplained by the effects of high-energy wave action on a large outcrop ofnaturally bedded sedimentary rock. When it first began to form, aeons ago, thesandstone (or more correctly in this case ‘mudstone’) of the body of themonument was deposited in layers of varying thickness and consistency, traversed‘by vertical cracks and horizontal crevices’. As sea-level rose and turbulentwaves began to strike progressively higher levels of the structure, these cracksand crevices were gradually exploited and opened up – with the softer layersseparating into flat slabs of assorted shapes and sizes which could then bewashed out by the sea. In such a fashion, explains Wolf, ‘perpendicularity andsteps’ gradually developed in the fracture zones creating, entirely withouthuman help, the most striking effects of the structure as we see it today.According to this reasoning, therefore, I was to envisage the 12 × 35 metreflat-floored patio as having been cut out of the side of the original outcrop bywave action which removed the sedimentary mudstone layers in slabs – with theterraced sections being formed out of the surviving harder members of rock afterthe softer layers had been washed away.I helped Wolf measure the two highest steps, then drifted off to the edge of thepatio and looked down the sheer 14 metre wall that drops to Professor Kimura’s‘loop road’ – the flat, rock-floored ‘pathway’ that runs along the bottom of thechannel immediately to the south of the monument. Although 25 metres wide at thedepth of the terraces, the channel narrows to a width of less than 4 metres atthe depth of the path. Its north wall is the sheer south face of the monument;its south wall is at first not sheer but slopes for some distance further to thesouth at an angle of about 40 degrees before rising more steeply towards thesurface. The 40 degree section is heavily but rather neatly stacked with blockyrubble that consists of an infill of smaller stones supporting a façade of adozen much larger blocks arranged, as Professor Kimura points out, in a straightline ‘as a stone wall’. Kimura is in no doubt that this wall is the work ofhuman beings.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_175_r1.jpg]Front view of the ‘stone wall’ surrounding Iseki Point (looking south from thepatio). Based on Kimura.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_176_r1.jpg]Cross-section showing, from left (north) to right (south), the sheer edge of thepatio, the ‘loop road’ and the ‘stone wall’. Based on Kimura.But because it is 27 metres down, and our dive computers didn’t like thedecompression implications of doing it as the fourth dive of an already hardday, we decided to leave it till the following morning.THE PATHWAYWe dropped in near the twin megaliths, then followed the clearly demarcatedrock-hewn pathway that seems to start (or finish?) here, veering to the left ofthe ‘entrance tunnel’ that we had passed through the day before, windinggradually to the south into deeper water around the western side of the mainmonument, then finally turning eastwards into the channel in front of theterraces at a depth of 27 metres.As we entered the channel I pointed out to Wolf a pattern of three symmetricalindentations, each 2 metres in length and only about 20 centimetres high, cut atregular intervals into the junction of the northern side of the path and thebase of the main monument. I also indicated two other details that I findparticularly impressive in this area: (a) the way that the floor of the pathappears to have been deliberately flattened and smoothed to give almost a pavedeffect; and (b) the way the path is completely free of any rubble until a pointabout 30 metres to the east of the terraces (where several large boulders andother stony debris have fallen or rolled).When Wolf and I later discussed the path and the terraces he remained adamantthat all the anomalies in these areas could have been produced by the effects oflocal erosive forces, mainly waves, on the ‘layer-cake’ strata of the Yonagunimudstones. In short, while he could not absolutely rule out human intervention,he did not feel that it was necessary in order to explain anything that we hadso far seen underwater.At this point I drew his attention to a project done by Professor Kimura and histeam from the University of the Ryukyus in cooperation with the Japanesenational TV channel TBS. The result had been a high-quality six-hourdocumentary, aired over New Year 2001, that made many useful and originalcontributions to the debate on the Yonaguni controversy.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn15] I wanted to acquaint Wolf inparticular with the comments and demonstrations of Koutaro Shinza, a traditionalOkinawan stone mason who had shown himself to be an expert in exploiting thenatural faults, cracks and layers in sedimentary rocks to facilitate quarrying.According to Shinza, whom TBS brought to Yonaguni,When I saw the undersea ruins I knew instantly it was a stone quarry. I showedphotographs to other stonecutters also and they all said the same. I concludethat it was done by human hands. It’s absolutely impossible for something likethis to be produced by nature alone …16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn16]Since Shinza’s technique of quarrying along the lines of weakness of existingjoints and fractures is functionally identical to the ‘method’ used by the seain Wolf’s scenario to break up and separate the Yonaguni mudstones into theterraces and steps we see today, I asked him whether he could be absolutelycertain that he could tell the difference. He admitted that he could not becertain – although the fact that he had as yet seen no definite tool marks onany of his dives was another reason to assume that humans had not been involved.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_177_r1.jpg]a. Wooden wedges are driven into a natural channel in the stone bed. The wedgesare then soaked with water, causing them to expand.b. As the wedges expand, the stone block splits from its bed. A chisel is usedto help split the block.c. The block is removed leaving flat, smooth surfaces on the bed. A tell-taletool-mark is left by the chisel on the edge of the upper bed.GH: Kimura makes a lot of the tool marks issue. He says he has definitely foundmarks. But I wouldn’t be very hopeful after 10,000 years of submersionunderwater to find tool marks. It’s a long time. This, of course, is hard stone.Wolf: Very hard stone, yes. And it is heavily overgrown with organisms in manyplaces. So we might find some marks, indeed, if we were looking a bit and if weknew where to look exactly and how to identify them clearly. But this I mean isnecessary.Had the sea randomly removed the rock layers to leave the terraces, or had itbeen ancient stone masons working to a plan? Neither scenario, we realized,could be unequivocally falsified – or proved – by the empirical evidencepresently to hand. But there was another way to come at the problem which couldat least test the logic of both propositions.Part of Professor Kimura’s evidence for human intervention in the constructionof the main Yonaguni monument is the stark absence of fallen stony rubble in thepathway beneath the terraces – which he suggests should be cluttered by debris,perhaps even completely buried under it, if the terraces had been cut naturallyby waves breaking up the pre-existing bedding planes. Where we do see debris onthe path itself it is in the form of a cluster of large boulders (not slabs) 30metres to the east of the terraces. And the only other area that might bedescribed as debris lies neatly stacked at an angle of 40 degrees against thesloping south face of the channel, touching but never trespassing the southernedge of the path. This is the embankment with a façade of a dozen megalithicblocks arranged in a row that Kimura has identified as man-made. I confess,however, that on all my many visits to Yonaguni – including these March 2001dives with Wolf – I have regarded this embankment as nothing more than rubblefallen from the south side of the channel and thus paid no special attention toit. It has only been since March 2001, looking back at the photographs and videoimages, that I have begun to realize how odd it is that not a bit of thesupposed ‘fallen rubble’ transgresses the path itself, how very ordered it seemsto be in general, and how very probable it is that Kimura is right.But on the trip with Wolf I focused only on the issue of the apparent ‘clean-up’operation that had been done on the path. I began by reminding him of ourearlier discussion about the twin megaliths, each 6 metres tall and weighing 100tonnes, which he claimed had fallen from above into their present position onthe north-west corner of the monument from some hypothetical former high point.Wolf: I see what you’re going for.GH: Well, what I’m going for is the problem of the path as we come in front ofIseki Point, as we come in front of the main monument. There’s a sheer wallabove the path 14 metres high and then the terracing begins. Now, if ever therewas a place on this structure where large slabs of stone should have fallen itis here on the path, directly under where the terraces were created. And sowhat’s bothering me is, if you can accept that the two parallel megaliths fellfrom a high place and lodged in position in the north-west corner of themonument and stayed there permanently, why don’t we find the path in front ofthe monument littered with the equally big or bigger slabs of rock that musthave been dislodged during the formation of the terraces?I sketched the north and south walls of the channel, with the path at the base,and the embankment of ‘orderly rubble’ gathered up against the south wall.GH: Piled up here against the south wall is a huge amount of large stones whichcontinue, in fact, up to this level (indicates sketch). And I can very wellaccept that those stones fell off the top of the south side and found themselvesin this position. As a matter of fact Professor Kimura doesn’t say that.Professor Kimura says that these stones were placed here by human beings.Wolf: Yes, yes, I know … I know.GH: And he may or may not be right on that matter, but I’m prepared to acceptthat the reasonable possibility, with the forces of gravity as I understandthem, is that stones which had been up here along this also rather flat area ontop of the south side, may have been washed off in water and tumbled down andpiled up here (indicates embankment). And that’s what I see. I see stones thatfell from up here on the south side. What I can’t understand, once we come tothe huge main terrace with its steps on the north side of the channel, is whyunder this nice vertical cliff I don’t find any stones at all lying on this 3metre wide path. And I don’t accept that they all rolled from the [north] sideinto this embankment [on the south side] conveniently leaving the pathimmediately beside it free. To me that’s against logic and nature.Wolf: We’re just guessing. So imagine that this flat area around the terraceswas not removed all in one go. What I mean is little small tiny pebbles,cobbles, whatever, over a long time have fallen down and they have somehow beentransported and rode supported by gravity here into this part [indicatesembankment area on south side of channel), being sheltered from furthertransport, first of all, by these large boulders.GH: Again I find it difficult to grasp you here. If I stand beside these steps[indicates the two big steps in the main terrace), they tower above my head.This means a layer of rock at least 21/2 metres thick, all the way around here[indicates patio area) has been removed completely to leave behind just thesteps.Wolf: Yes.GH: I mean this patio is, what, 30 or 35 metres in length?Wolf: Round about.GH: And we have a layer of rock 21/2 metres thick; that’s a hell of a lot ofrock.Wolf: We’re not talking about two or three years.GH: We’re talking of a long period of time. So you’re explaining this by sayingthat small pieces were broken off little by little and taken away by the tides?Wolf: Yes, right … in general.GH: Yeah. I find the more elegant explanation is it was tidied up by humanbeings —Wolf: Fine.GH: – after they finished their job.Wolf: But where should they put it, then? Somewhere here around?GH: Wherever they wished.Wolf: Come on.GH: If human beings do take material away from sites, they take it right away …get it away … this is known human activity … very normal … they don’t leave therubble lying around on the site, this is normal.Wolf: This is clearly what Kimura says.GH: It’s Kimura’s argument, and I find it persuasive.THE PALACEOur fifth dive was at a site several kilometres to the west of Iseki Point thatlocal divers call the ‘Palace’ and that the Indian archaeologist Sundareshrefers to in his December 2000 report as an ‘underwater cave area’. Sundareshdoes not comment on the structural characteristics of the Palace itself, whichis indeed surrounded by natural caves, but notes that inside it:a boulder about I m diameter engraved with carvings was observed. About 100 mtowards the eastern side of the caves more rock engravings were noticed on thebedrock … The rock engravings inside the cave and on the bedrock were probablycarved out by means of a tool of some sort.17[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn17]The entry to the ‘Palace’ can be made through a number of holes broken in itsroof at about 9 metres water depth or through what I suggest may have been itsoriginal entrance at a depth of 14 metres. Here the diver has to squeeze throughgaps in a jumble of fallen boulders to enter a small, gloomy, gravel-flooredchamber oriented roughly north-south with space for four or five adults standingupright. Its south wall is blocked. In its north wall there is a ‘doorway’,about a metre high, through which visitors would have had to pass crouched, orcrawling, when the Palace was above sea-level. The doorway has a rough, damagedappearance with no obviously man-made characteristics, but beyond it is aspacious and beautiful chamber that glows with an otherworldly blue light whenthe sun projects down through the column of water and illuminates it through theholes in its roof.Like the cramped antechamber this atmospheric main room is oriented north-south.It measures approximately 10 metres in length and 5 metres in width. Its heightfrom floor to ceiling is also about 5 metres. While there has been a substantialcollapse of its eastern side, its western side is undamaged and presents as asmooth vertical wall of very large megaliths supporting further megaliths thatform the roof.Roughly at its mid-point the chamber begins to narrow towards the north untilthe east and west walls come together in a corridor less than 2 metres wide thatculminates in another ‘doorway’ – this time a very tall and narrow one. Acrossthe top of its uprights, whether by accident or by design, one of the roofmegaliths lies like a lintel.After having passed through this second and more impressive doorway at thenorthern end of the main chamber, the diver comes into a third and final room ofthe Palace. It is completely unlike the other two, which were ‘built’ (either bynature or by man) out of large blocks piled on top of one another. This thirdchamber, on the other hand, was hewn or hollowed – it is premature to decide bywhat – out of a mass of ancient coralline limestone that is exposed in this partof Yonaguni. There are no ‘blocks’ in it at all. It extends only 3 metres inlength and a little over a metre in width and culminates at its north end in yetanother ‘doorway’ – this time I insist distinctly ‘squared-off’ – which leadsinto a closed alcove that in turn funnels vertically upwards and opens outthrough a hole in the roof.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_178_r1.jpg]Comparison of submerged megaliths at Yonugani (left) and on land at Mt Nabeyama,Gifu Prefecture, Japan (right, see page 563).All three of the ‘doorways’ in the Palace, the first at the south side of themain room, the second at the north side, and the third leading into the alcovebeyond, are positioned in a straight line creating what is, in effect, analigned passage/chamber system. And since the rear (northernmost) chamber andalcove door are hewn out of a different kind of rock than other materials in thestructure, we must assume that some agency brought these two elements (therock-hewn element and the megalithic element) together – and in alignment -atsome point. But was it nature that did this? Or could it have been the Jomon ina hitherto unrecognized phase of their prehistory when they moved gigantic rocksand boulders with apparent ease and set in train the cult of stone in Japan thatstill permeates the nation’s spiritual life today?Wolf would have nothing of it. In his no-nonsense view the Palace is, of course,a wholly natural phenomenon and the alignment of the three doorways is entirelycoincidental. Very probably he is right. Yet I retain a sense of deep curiosityabout this structure and intend, if I can, to do more work in it at some time inthe future. On one previous dive near by I came across parts of what looked likea second megalithic passage/chamber system that I would also like to revisit.Whether they are natural or man-made it is likely, by virtue of their depth ofsubmergence, that both systems are thousands of years older than Japan’smysterious Kofun era, which is thought to have begun around AD 300. Yet bothsystems powerfully and eerily remind me of the architecture of the greatmegalithic passageways and burial chambers of the Kofun age – particularlystructures such as Ishibutai near Asuka, where the megaliths used are of trulytitanic dimensions and weights (see chapter 25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c25_r1.htm#c25]). I remind the reader thatarchaeologists have as yet uncovered no evolutionary background to the advancedmegalithic skills that suddenly manifest in Japan in the Kofun era, and raisethe possibility for consideration that the knowledge of how to build withmegaliths on such a scale may long previously have evolved in areas aroundJapan’s coasts that are now underwater.I realize that this begs more questions than it answers. Still, go figure wherethe Kofun tradition came from. Some scholars say Korea, but the evidence isn’tgood and others scholars disagree. Nobody pays much attention to Japan’s ownearlier epoch of stone architecture – witnessed by the stone circles and‘mountain-landscaping’ of the Jomon age – because up till today a prejudicepersists that the Jomon were simple hunter-gatherers and nothing more.I do not deny that they were simple hunter-gatherers but the deeper I enter intothe labyrinth of Japanese prehistory the more certain I feel that they were alsosomething much more …THE FACE AND THE STONE STAGEOn our sixth and final dive at Yonaguni in March 2001 I took Wolf to a placecalled Tatigami Iwa 8 kilometres east of the Palace and about 21/2 kilometreseast of the main cluster of monuments around Iseki Point.Tatigami Iwa means ‘Standing Kami Stone’ and refers to a rock pinnacle 40 metreshigh, weirdly gnarled and eroded, left behind thousands of years ago when therest of a former cliff of which it was once part was washed away. Understandablyrevered as a deity in local tradition it now stands lashed by the Pacific Ocean100 metres from shore like a ghost sentry for this haunted island. But it iswhat is underneath it, in the underwater landscape near by, that reallyinterests me and that led me to choose it as the site for our sixth dive. Forhere, at a depth of around 18 metres, a huge carving of a human face is to beseen -with two eyes, a nose and a mouth hacked, either by natural forces or byhuman agency, into the corner of an outcrop of dark rock that juts upprominently from a distinctive ‘blocky’ plain.I showed Wolf how the ‘face formation’ manifests a combination of peculiarities.For it is not just a face – or something that looks like one (which natureprovides numerous accidental examples of) – but a grim and scary face, whichseems designed to overawe, carved with care and attention to the lines and flowof the base rock. Moreover, far from appearing haphazardly with no context, asone would expect with an accidentally formed natural ‘face’, it seems framedwithin a deliberate ceremonial setting. Thus, a horizontal platform just under 2metres high and 5 metres wide – called by local divers the ‘Stone Stage’ opensout from the side of the face at the level of the mouth and runs along to theback of the head where a narrow passageway penetrates the whole structure fromwest to east.The ‘Face’, therefore, has to be viewed together with its ‘Stone Stage’ as asingle rock-hewn edifice and I note, as does Sundaresh in his report citedearlier, that the flat area out of which the Stage and Face rise is easily largeenough to have accommodated thousands of people before sea-levels rose to coverit. Also noteworthy, however, is the fact that Face/Stage edifice is not alonein this big area but is part of a neighbourhood of anomalous rock-hewn and oftenrectilinear structures clustered around the base of Tatigami Iwa.Natural? Or man-made? Or a bit of both? My vote is weird and wonderful nature,enhanced by man, thousands of years ago. But what did Wolf think?Wolf: First of all we have to mention that this is a totally different sort ofsandstone from what we find at Iseki Point. It’s very thick – a series of verythick and massive banks which consist, contrary to the Iseki Point material, ofquite soft sandstone which is very, very sensitive to erosion and erodesgenerally in more rounded forms than the Iseki Point sandstone or mudstone.Secondly, erosion of rock, all around the world, often produces forms that lookaccidentally like human faces … So I cannot say very much to the Face. To becomeclear of that fact, again, you would have to remove all the organisms aroundbecause that would give you a free view on the rock and the way it was carved.GH: Did you notice, looking into the eyes, the eye sockets of the Face, thatboth of them had a central prominence?Wolf: No. No, sorry … I haven’t looked.GH: You didn’t see.Wolf: I saw the Face and I thought, ‘Yeah, hmm, what to do with this?’GH: Yes.Wolf: But you see, I’m used … I’m not used to go straight to the things but to —GH: Yeah, to stand back, yeah, I noticed that.Wolf: – take a distance and look, hmm, how can this be formed? But it was myfirst view on that. I don’t have an answer on that at the moment.GH: Something else about it too, for me, is the sense that I keep finding theseproblems – if we look back over our drawings over the last couple of days – wellhere from our first dive we have, within a short area, parallel curved walls, aramp, a tunnel, two megaliths. We come round in front of the monument, a clearpathway, and as far as I’m concerned still with the mystery of the missingmaterial – if indeed, as we also agreed earlier, all of this mass of materialthat we see in the embankment came from the south side – because as you said, itdoesn’t look like it belonged on the north side —Wolf: On this view, yes.GH: - it’s the proximity of all these peculiar things, each of which requires arather detailed geological explanation and, in some cases, requireshypotheticals such as a cliff which once hung over that area and dropped thesetwo megaliths down there. I find – and this is how I felt always almost from thethird or fourth visit that I made to Yonaguni – is that this, this fantasticcombination of peculiarities in a very compact area -because as you saw todaythe peculiarities continue as we go further along the coast to the Face and theStone Stage –Wolf: That’s right, I was deeply impressed when I saw that.GH: - the thing that’s striking is that all of these peculiarities occur alongthe south and east coasts of Yonaguni, and none of them are found along thenorth coast – at least, if they’ve been found, divers aren’t talking about them,and divers usually do talk about places like this. So, you know, we find themalong the south side but not along the north side. We find them compacted into arelatively tight area, and each one requires a rather different, and to my mind,rather complicated geological explanation, you know, disposing of a mass of rockthat is 21/2 metres thick and 35 metres in length [and 15 metres wide] is simplybanishing it. And attributing that to wave action, to me that’s just going alittle bit too far —Wolf: I see what you’re getting at.GH: – on the strength and the variability of geological forces in a small area,and it catches in my throat. I find that I can’t, I just can’t buy it.Wolf: OK. I would ask you to have a look into new or even older geological andgeographical literature. You’ll find all these things precisely described innewly published literature and —GH: Nowhere in the world – never mind the literature, books are books -butnowhere in the world, not a single place in the world will I find all thesethings together … because one thing’s for sure, look at the publicity that thisstructure has attracted.Wolf: Because you raised it.GH: Actually, not me … it was —Wolf: Together with others.GH: – many other people … many other people have raised it. Worldwide it hasattracted an enormous amount of publicity. I think it’s a fair bet that ifsomething comparable had been found, anywhere else on this planet of ours withits 70 per cent cover by water, if something similar had been found, we wouldhave heard about it by now. And it’s the uniqueness of this structure and theseries of structures along the south and east coasts of Yonaguni that reallyleads me towards the involvement of man. Now I believe that the people who wereinvolved in this were a megalithic culture; they understood rock, and theyworked just as currents and erosive forces do, that is, they worked with thenatural strike of the rock; where there is a fault, it’s a good place, let’stake advantage of it. Any great sculptor still looks for the natural forms inrock and, indeed, this is an art form in Japan up to this day. So, you know,these are all the factors that lead me to the conclusion that I’m looking atrock that has been overworked by people.Wolf: And I would say, on the contrary, that it is a natural miracle … And justto finish that, my definite point of view is that all that we have seen in thelast days could have been made by nature alone without the help of man. Thatdoes not mean that people did not have any influence on it. I didn’t say that …I would never say that. But I say it can have been shaped by nature alone.OTHER MIRACLESThere are several other intriguing sites around Yonaguni that I was not able toshow Wolf in the time available to us in March 2001 – though I do not think anyof them would have changed his mind.One of these, which takes a form that some recognize as a huge rock-hewnsea-turtle, stands at a depth of 12 metres on the shoulder of the main monumentat Iseki Point approximately 150 metres east of the terraces.A second, badly damaged when Yonaguni was struck by an unusually severe seriesof typhoons in August and September 200018[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c27-ftn18] is found half a kilometre dueeast of the terraces in about 15 metres of water. Consisting of a one-tonneboulder mounted on a 10-centimetre-high flat platform at the apex of an enormousrocky slab almost 3 metres high, it has all the characteristics of a classiciwakura shrine, part natural rock, part man-made. As I noted in Chapter 25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c25_r1.htm#c25], if this shrine were to be moved to theslopes of Mount Miwa it would blend in seamlessly with what is already there.Two other anomalous sites are located within half a kilometre of Iseki Point,and I would also very much have liked Wolf to see them. One is the extraordinary‘Stadium’, a vast amphitheatre surrounding a stone plain at a depth of 30metres. The other is a second area of very large steps – on a similar scale andof a similar appearance to those of the main terrace at Iseki Point, but muchfurther out to sea, in deeper water, and at the bottom of a protected channel.Nor does the list of signs and wonders end here, but I think the point has beensufficiently made. Some people with good minds – among them Japanese scientistswith Ph.D.’s – are adamant that what they see underwater at Yonaguni arerock-hewn structures that have been worked upon by humans and purposefullyarranged. Others with equally good minds and equally good Ph.D.’s are equallyadamant that they see no rock-hewn structures underwater at Yonaguni at all –only rocks.Rocks? Or structures? Just interesting geology? Or discoveries that could fixthe true origins of Japanese civilization as far back in the Age of the Gods asthe Nihongi and the Kojiki themselves claim? These are grave questions and theycannot be answered at Yonaguni on the basis of available evidence. Wolf is rightabout that. It is just possible that the remarkable structures and objects thatI showed him there underwater are all freaks of nature, which by some amazingadditional improbability all happen to be gathered together in one place.I don’t think that is what they are. And I repeat that the balance of first-handscientific opinion is, at the time of writing, two-to-one against Wichmann inthis matter (Kimura and Sundaresh provide two clear votes for the structureshaving been overworked by man; Wichmann provides one clear vote in favour of thestructures being entirely natural; Professor Schoch votes both ways). In thefuture other discoveries, and other diving scientists, could alter this balanceof opinion dramatically in either direction. But we shall have to wait and see.Meanwhile, after a thorough exposure on-site to Wolf Wichmann’s relentlessempiricism I concede that I am not yet in a position to prove that humans wereinvolved in the creation of the Yonaguni structure – any more than Wolf canprove, as he admits, that they were not.But I believe Wolf came to his conclusions about Yonaguni sincerely, not toohastily, and on the basis of his own vast experience as a marine geologist ofhow different kinds of rock behave underwater. Although I disagree with him, Itherefore resolved as we left the island in March 2001 that I would not base anyargument or any claim in Underworld on the copious evidence which suggests thatthe submerged structures of Yonaguni are indeed ancient rock-hewn human sites …In this chapter I have simply tried to marshal and present that evidence, andWolf’s purposeful and eloquent counter-views, as clearly and as objectively aspossible, as a matter of public record.But suppose for a moment – an exercise in speculation only – that I and othersare right about Yonaguni. If so, then what Japan has lost to the rising seas isno small or insignificant matter but a defining episode in world prehistorygoing back more than 10,000 years. For if the Jomon did make the greatstructures that were submerged off the south and east coasts of Yonaguni at theend of the Ice Age, then we are confronted by a previously unexpected and as yetcompletely unexplained dimension of that increasingly remarkable ancientculture. In terms of organization, effort, engineering and ambition, the sheerscale of the enterprise is beyond anything that the Jomon of 10,000 or 12,000years ago (or any other human culture of that epoch) are thought to have beencapable of. Yet it makes a strange kind of sense in the context of the otherincongruous characteristics of these strange ‘hunter-gatherers’ – theirpermanent settlements, their stone circles, their cultivation of rice, and theirnavigational and maritime achievements in two different waves of settlement ofthe Americas (one as early as 15,000 years ago, one more like 5000 years ago).Wolf and I had just one more day of diving to do after Yonaguni, just one moreday for me to find him a major structure in Japanese waters that he could notcome up with a natural explanation for … For that adventure, and test, I hadchosen the great stone circles at Kerama."},{"pageContent":"28 / MAPS OF JAPAN AND TAIWAN 13,000 YEARS AGO?In part based on Marco Polo’s inaccurate figure for Zipangu’s distance from theChinese coast, the Florentine physician and astronomer Paolo Toscanelli, who –like many another medieval scholar – assumed that the world was a sphere, placedZipangu some 5000 nautical miles west of Europe on his map of the world … Asearly as 1470, Toscanelli proposed to the Portuguese king that one could reachCathay, Zipangu, and the Spice Islands (the Moluccas) – perhaps even morequickly – by sailing directly westward.Ulrich Pauly, German East-Asiatic Society, Tokyo1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c28-ftn1]It was the submerged structures of Japan that first awakened me to thepossibility that an underworld in history, unrecognized by archaeologists, couldlie concealed and forgotten beneath the sea. Then, when I learned to dive andstarted to look elsewhere, I began to realize how vast this vanished underworldreally might be – for its traces seem to have been scattered around thecontinental margins not only of the Pacific but also of the Atlantic and theIndian Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea.In five years of diving, following up rumours of anomalous underwater structureswherever they have been sighted, and using the logic suggested by convergencesbetween flood myths and inundation maps to seek out probable sites, I know thatI have only scratched the surface of the mystery. I’m just a private individualwithout any of the institutional infrastructure behind me that is really neededfor productive marine archaeology. Even so, there has not been space in thisbook for me to recount the results and experiences of all my own dives andexplorations – let alone all the dives and explorations that should be done inthe future if we really want to know what’s out there.I’ve said nothing for example about the underwater enigmas of Tenerife where Idived, and was nearly swallowed by the sea, in June 2000. I learned a lot there… about the Kami Great-Ocean-Possessor.I’ve not spoken of the work Santha and I did in the South Pacific around theTahitian islands of Raiatea and Huahine, or of the strange things we sawunderwater off the Tongan island of Haapai.And I’ve said nothing more about Alexandria, which I introduced in chapter 1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01]. Yet Santha and I spent several weeksdiving along the Alexandrian coast with Ashraf Bechai looking for, andeventually relocating, some of the giant blocks of Sidi Gaber that he had firstsighted years before. Indeed, we found a carpet of gargantuan stone blocks in anadvanced state of erosion, completely unconnected to any of the known marinearchaeological sites in the vicinity, covering a huge area of the sea-bed at10–12 metres water depth (see photos 1–3).But while all this was happening, and as I began to focus more and more closelyon specific regions and specific issues of the ‘underworld’ problem, it alwaysremained my intention to seek a final reckoning on the submerged structuresaround Japan that had started me on the quest. I took my time – years in fact –to do the travels and the dives in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans and in theMediterranean Sea that I’ve described in this book. But through it all I wasprivileged to be able to revisit Japan frequently, to continue to diverepeatedly at all the most important sites in the Ryukyu archipelago, and toacquaint myself thoroughly with their characteristics and peculiarities.SATANAZE AND ANTILIASo the point we are at now in the story is exactly where I had always intendedthat we should arrive. Strangely, however, because quests have lives of theirown, we have arrived here by a route quite different from the one I imagined wewould take. This happened because I did not anticipate the appearance, very latein the investigation, of a significant intersection between the mystery of theancient maps and the mystery of the underwater ruins of Japan. On the contrary,having pored over many early maps of Japan by both Japanese and Westerncartographers, and having found none that show it in anything like its Ice Ageconfiguration, I long ago gave up the search.It was only when I was finalizing the maps argument in Part 5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_p05_r1.htm#p05], and in fact pursuing Bimini, that Iread Professor Robert Fuson’s breakthrough study, Legendary Islands of the OceanSea, and realized that I’d been looking in the wrong place all along. If therewas indeed a lost cartographical science of the Ice Age then its best crumbs hadbeen preserved in the portolan tradition in Europe by pre-Columbian mariners andcopyists who themselves knew nothing about the existence of the Americas or thePacific Ocean. If an Ice Age map of Japan – and one of nearby Taiwan – was goingto turn up anywhere, therefore, it made perfect sense that it should do so in apre-Columbian European portolan purporting to depict islands in the AtlanticOcean.I need to reiterate that Professor Fuson goes nowhere near this far; nor wouldhe wish to. His breakthrough, which I described in chapter 24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c24_r1.htm#c24], is the discovery of the compellingseries of correlations on the 1424 Venetian chart that link Satanaze with Japanand Antilia with Taiwan. Fuson plausibly suggests that the source map – or maps– that the Venetian copyist worked from could have originated in the voyages ofthe Chinese admiral Cheng Ho in the early fifteenth century and could quiteeasily have found their way to the West from one or other of Cheng Ho’s fleetsvia Arab intermediaries prior to 1424.Because the correlations he presents are in general so persuasive, one glaringmistake on the 1424 chart is not fatal to Fuson’s argument. The mistake, as headmits, is that Japan’s ‘three main islands (Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu) arerepresented by the single island of Satanaze. The channel between Kyushu andShikoku/Honshu (modern Bungo-suido and Suo-nada) is well-defined.’2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c28-ftn2] But 12,500 years ago, thismistake would not have been a mistake at all because at that time Honshu, Kyushuand Shikoku were indeed consolidated by lowered sea-levels into a singlelandmass.While I’m prepared to accept that the Venetian cartographer’s source mapsprobably did come from the voyages of Cheng Ho therefore, it is not inevitablethat these maps were necessarily ones that had been newly charted by Cheng Ho’snavigators. They could equally well have been amongst the many older maps thatCheng Ho is known to have brought along on the voyages. We will see later thatChina by Cheng Ho’s time, already possessed a cartographical tradition that washoary with antiquity.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c28-ftn3] It is byno means impossible that the same wellspring of mysteriously anachronisticgeographical knowledge from which Marinus of Tyre may have sipped, and that sonourished the portolan tradition in Europe in the late Middle Ages, had alsobeen known all along to the ancient Chinese.I suggest that the 1424 chart may contain evidence of that knowledge.THE MISSING WATERWAYSAlthough sea-level is still rising today, the rate of change is very slow andhas made no significant difference to Japan’s coastlines during the past 1000years. It is safe, therefore, to treat the modern map of Japan as an accurateportrayal of the archipelago as it would have looked in the early fifteenthcentury,Now compare the map of Japan with the portrayal of Satanaze/Saya on the 1424Venetian chart (opposite).At first glance, despite an obvious general similarity of layout, I think onewould not immediately leap to endorse Fuson’s conclusion that Satanazerepresents Kyushu, Shikoku and Honshu (since it is only one island, not three)or that little Saya represents Hokkaido. However, the theory is undoubtedlycorrect and I have already presented the principal evidence that underpins it inchapter 24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c24_r1.htm#c24]. All that remains to beadded is the process of ‘cartographic devolution’ (the gradual introduction oferrors and deletions in a series of copies) by which Fuson believes that theVenetian mapmaker managed to turn Japan into Satanaze. This is best expressed inhis own diagrammatic way (see page 630).To focus the discussion here, I will accept Fuson’s well-supported argument thatmost of Hokkaido was simply ignored and reduced to the rump of Saya on theoriginal source map from which the 1424 chart was copied.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c28-ftn4] I will accept too his othersuggestion that at some stage in the chain of copying and transmission by whichthe source map reached Europe a large section of the north of Honshu was missedout thus shortening the distance from the tip of Honshu to the tip of Kyushu.But it is the other proposed ‘deletions’ of the copyists that interest me. Allof these – every one of them with remarkable consistency – prove to be‘deletions’ of bays and inter-island waterways that have only come intoexistence around Japan since the end of the Ice Age. In other words there was atime, not too long ago (and certainly well within the enormous span of Japan’smysterious Jomon culture), when most of the bays and inter-island waterways onthe modern map were dry land and did look pretty much the way the 1424 chart ofSatanaze shows them.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_179_r1.jpg]Modern map of Japan.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_180_r1.jpg]The island of Satanaze, from the 1424 Pizzagano chart.I will focus here on the portrayal of modern Japan’s most prominent group ofinter-island waterways around the Inland Sea separating Honshu, Kyushu andShikoku. Fuson himself takes special notice of ‘the channel between Kyushu andShikoku/Honshu’ on the 1424 chart, and its ‘well-defined’ presence there isundoubtedly helpful to his case. To make use of it, however, he has to overlookthe fact that the equally prominent channel that has separated Shikoku fromHonshu for at least the last 9000 years is not only not ‘well-defined’ butactually is not shown at all. Likewise, he must put up with a very poorportrayal of the segment of Satanaze that he allocates to Kyushu – poor, thatis, if it is a portrayal of Kyushu in 1424. However, either by chance, orbecause a fragment of a cartographical tradition from the end of the Ice Age wasresurrected in that 1424 chart – or for some other reason – its portrayal ofwhat is now Kyushu does match very well with Kyushu’s actual appearance at theend of the Ice Age.Let’s look more closely at this odd ‘coincidence’ with reference to the 1424chart, the modern map of Japan, and inundation maps of the archipelago providedby Glenn Milne and his team at Durham University. The latter model Japan’scoastlines at the following dates: 21,300 years ago (onset of the Last GlacialMaximum), 16,900 years ago (end of LGM and start of meltdown), and thereafter atroughly millennium intervals for 14,600 years ago, 13,500 years ago, 12,400years ago, 10,600 years ago, 8900 years ago, 7700 years ago and 6900 years ago(end of meltdown).[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_181_r1.jpg]The cartographic devolution of Japan into Satanaze, according to Fuson (1995). ©R. H. Fuson.MAPPING SPECIFIC ICE AGE DETAILSWe’ll begin with the modern map of Japan, on which we note that Kyushu is onlyjust an island, separated by a very narrow strait from the southern tip ofHonshu. Nonetheless, it is an island. The strait widens into the Suo Gulf of theInland Sea. There it splits into two branches – one trending southwards into theBungo Strait between Kyushu and Shikoku, the other trending north-eastwards viathe Iyo Gulf to the series of further straits that separate Shikoku from Honshu.Now look at the depiction of the same waterways on the 1424 chart ofSatanaze/Japan (opposite). It is obvious immediately that the system is muchsimpler.Most notable difference: instead of the narrow strait that today lies betweenKyushu and Honshu we observe that the two islands are joined by a land-bridgealmost 100 kilometres wide.Most notable similarity: there is a roughly square inlet on the south-east sideof Satanaze which corresponds well with the location and direction of thepresent Bungo Strait.But today, as we’ve seen, the Bungo Strait splits into the Suo Gulf to itsnorth-west and the Iyo Gulf to its north-east. On the 1424 chart, by contrast,the Suo Gulf is completely missing. And although the Iyo Gulf is present, notethat it is represented only as a very narrow, north-east-trending, fjord-likechannel. Opposite its terminus, on the south-west side of Satanaze/Japan, thereis a further, much smaller inlet. The neck of land between the two – about 100kilometres wide – lies along the line of the missing Suo Gulf.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_182_r1.jpg]61.

The author diving beside the parallel megaliths, Yonaguni, Japan.When we compare the 1424 chart with the inundation map sequence (pages 632–4),no obvious correlation emerges down to as late as 14,600 years ago, when Kyushu,Honshu and Shikoku were still so firmly bonded together by lowered sea-levelsthat even the Bungo Strait did not exist.Within just another thousand years, however, around 13,500 years ago, theinundation maps show that a squarish inlet topped by a narrow,north-east-trending, fjord-like channel very similar to the portrayal of theBungo Strait on the 1424 chart had opened up.The correlation remains much the same on the inundation map for 12,400 yearsago, although it is possible to detect a slight opening to the north-west, notshown in the 1424 chart, in what was to become the Suo Gulf.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_203_r1.jpg]By 10,600 years ago, however, the correlation is much less precise, with boththe Suo and Iyo Gulfs opening up into fat cloverleafs north-west and north-eastof the Bungo Strait.Finally, by 8900 years ago, the submergence of the shorelines around the InlandSea approaches today’s levels, Shikoku, Kyushu and Honshu begin to emerge asseparate islands, and the geography of the 1424 chart becomes and remains ananachronism.Bearing in mind the limitations of inundation science – these maps are models,based on the latest data but do not claim 100 per cent accuracy – there is nodoubt that the best correlation between the 1424 chart and the actual appearanceof this part of Japan comes not in 1424 but in a specific and clearly demarcated1100-year time-window between 13,500 years ago and 12,400 years ago.Coincidence? Or the leavings and memories of ancient world maps preservedamongst mariners since the end of the Ice Age in fragments, and copies offragments, and fragments of copies?[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_204_r1.jpg]Satanaze from the 1424 Pizzagano chart.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_205_r1.jpg][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_206_r1.jpg]WHAT ABOUT TAIWAN?As I was considering the implications of this interesting problem it occurred tome – since Satanaze appears together with Antilia on the 1424 chart – that thetwo islands probably appeared together on the source map too. In that case thetreatment of Antilia/Taiwan on the 1424 chart could serve as a useful control tospeculation about Satanaze/Japan. If, for example, it should turn out thatTaiwan’s 1424 portrayal was best matched by the modern appearance of the islandand bore no resemblance to the inundation maps then it would make it more likelythat any Satanaze/Japan correlations were just coincidences. On the other hand,if Antilia and ancient Taiwan matched up well to one another, and especially ifthey were to do so in the same time-window as Satanaze/Japan, then I thoughtthis would make it much more likely that the similarities had been derived froma common source map that had contained accurate depictions of Japan and Taiwanas they had looked at the end of the Ice Age.At the beginning of the meltdown around 16,400 years ago lowered sea-levelsmeant that Taiwan was not an island but was, instead, fully integrated with theeast coast of China. The inundation maps show its distinctive narrowsouth-eastern tip, which has changed its appearance very little over time,protruding as a peninsula from a vast antediluvian landmass extending eastwardsfor hundreds of kilometres from the present Chinese coast. These long-lostcoastal plains, fertile with the silt of the ancient Yangtse and Yellow rivers,were wide and extensive enough to incorporate the entire Korean peninsula muchfurther north, completely filling the basin of the Yellow Sea, and the Bo Haiand Korea Bays (page 635).[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_207_r1.jpg][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_208_r1.jpg]The situation of Taiwan had not dramatically changed two millennia later, asrepresented in the inundation map for 14,600 years ago. We can see there (page635) that it has made some progress towards its eventual destiny as an islandbut that it is still very much fixed to the mainland and as such offers nocorrelation with the 1424 chart of Antilia/Taiwan. In fact the inundation mapsshow that Taiwan did not become an island, and thus did not even become eligiblefor comparison with Antilia, until 13,500 years ago (above).It is notable, therefore, when we compare its appearance at that time to theoutline of Antilia, that we immediately find a tantalizing resemblance, butcertainly not an exact one. For, although the inundation map shows Taiwan as anisland of roughly the right shape, it also shows a distinctive peninsulaprotruding from the mid-latitudes of its west coast that is not to be seenanywhere on Antilia. Instead, the 1424 chart gives us a second smaller island,named Ymana,5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c28-ftn5] roughly where thepeninsula on the inundation map ends.The next inundation map in the sequence, which shows Taiwan as it looked 12,400years ago, is where things get interesting. Very strikingly the peninsula hasvanished and what remains is an island of the right size and in the rightlocation to match Ymana (page 638).Again, is it a coincidence?[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_209_r1.jpg]Antilia from the 1424 Pizzagano chart.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_210_r1.jpg]Taiwan 12,400 years ago.Here the logic that led me to look for Antilia/Taiwan correlations at the end ofthe Ice Age (as a control on the apparent correlations I had noticed betweenSatanaze and Japan in the same period) works in reverse to reduce the likelihoodof coincidence still further. Of course it still could be a coincidence. Thefact is, however, that the representations of Antilia and Satanaze on the 1424chart not only appear to have captured characteristics of Taiwan and Japan asboth looked during the meltdown of the Ice Age but, far more impressively, asboth looked during exactly the same ‘window’ between 13,500 and 12,400 yearsago.OBJECTIONSThere are two important objections to this line of reasoning, which must beregistered and responded to immediately.First, despite its steep coastlines, Japan did undergo significant changes toits appearance at the end of the Ice Age when one antediluvian island – Satanazeon the 1424 chart – was filleted into segments by the rising seas to form modernKyushu, Shikoku and Honshu. Taiwan’s even steeper coastlines, by comparison,have changed much less since it first became an island around 13,500 years ago.Thus to the extent that Robert Fuson is right at all to identify Antilia as amap of Taiwan, then it could, theoretically, be a map of Taiwan in almost anyepoch after 13,500 years ago. As such isn’t it too vague and general anindicator to be useful for any particular purpose or to draw any specificconclusions from?My response to this objection is that Antilia has more information to revealthan at first meets the eye.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_211_r1.jpg]Superimposition of 1424 Antilia on modern Taiwan.A good starting point is Fuson’s own superimposition of Antilia on to a modernmap of Taiwan. As the reader will observe, other than the overall dimensions andthe roughly rectangular shape being about right, the correlations between thecoastlines of the two islands are not in fact particularly good (and would makeno case in themselves were it not for the many other convincing comparisonsbetween Antilia and Taiwan that Fuson is able to present).6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c28-ftn6]When compared with the modern map Antilia does best in the south-east -whereboth it and Taiwan come to a distinct sharply pointed, south-east-facing cape.But in the south-west, north-west and north-east the island depicted on the 1424chart extends many kilometres beyond the coastal margins of Taiwan as it lookstoday.Is it another coincidence that two out of these three supposed ‘mistakes’ inAntilia’s portrayal of the main island of Taiwan would make perfect sense if thesource maps showed Taiwan as it looked around the end of the Ice Age? There isno match at any date for the triangle of land that Antilia adds on to Taiwan inthe south-west. But the extra lands that Antilia also claims in the north-westand the north-east of Taiwan do correlate closely with extra lands – then stillabove water in precisely these areas – that show up on the inundation map for12,400 years ago. Since 12,400 years ago is also the date that provides the bestfit for the island of Ymana on the 1424 chart, coincidence seems to me anexplanation that is increasingly difficult to defend …[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_212_r1.jpg]Superimposition of 1424 Antilia on Taiwan as it looked 12,400 years ago.However, it is precisely here that a second objection must be registered andresponded to. One of Robert Fuson’s proofs that Antilia is Taiwan, cited inchapter 24 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c24_r1.htm#c24], is that: ‘Taiwan also hassomething else that Antilia must have. And that is a small island to the west.On the 1424 Pizzagano chart it was called Ymana. Today it is the Peng-Hu group,or Pescadores (Islands of the Fishermen).’7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c28-ftn7] It is the Pescadores, exaggeratedinto a single larger landmass by cartographers’ errors, that Fuson speculatesserved as the model for Ymana.My response is that the location of the Pescadores in relation to the mainisland of Taiwan – marked today by little more than dots on the map – is notidentical to the location of Ymana, but considerably further south. By contrast,as we’ve seen, the inundation map for 12,400 years ago provides a singleantediluvian island of the right size and in the right location to be Ymana. Thesame map shows us that the Pescadores were, at that time, still part of theChinese mainland and lay at the tip of a peninsula some 200 kilometres south ofmy antediluvian candidate for Ymana. They did not finally become islands-initially just one island – until around 10,600 years ago and thereafter weregradually broken up into the many much smaller remnants that still survivetoday.It remains entirely possible that Fuson is right and that it was the Pescadoresthat served as the model for Ymana – though I note in passing that they wouldhave more closely resembled Ymana when they were consolidated by loweredsea-level into one island around 10,600 years ago than at any much later date.I was therefore overtaken by an irresistible feeling of curiosity when news cameto me from my Japanese friends that extensive underwater ruins had beendiscovered in the Pescadores. Lying off the south shore of a tiny island calledHu-Ching – it means ‘Tiger Well’ – the ruins were said to consist of twogigantic walls crossing each other at right angles extending from a minimumdepth of just 4 metres to a maximum depth of more than 36 metres. It was tootempting a prospect to pass up and Seamen’s Club were willing to fund one moretrip. Santha and I packed our dive gear and flew out to Taiwan at the end ofAugust 2001.But I’m getting ahead of my story. Before we fast-forward to Taiwan we need torewind to the end of chapter 27 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c27_r1.htm#c27] and themini-expedition to Japan’s Ryukyu archipelago that I made in March 2001 with theGerman geologist Wolf Wichmann. The reader will recall that Wolf and I leftYonaguni, the westernmost of the Ryukyus, after failing to reach agreement onthe provenance of the underwater structures there. Our next destination wasNaha, capital city of the much larger island of Okinawa, where we would be aone-hour journey by boat from what are perhaps the most extraordinary andenigmatic underwater structures in all of Japan – the great stone circles ofKerama."},{"pageContent":"29 / CONFRONTING KERAMAI agree that this is very amazing and very strange, even to me, how thesestructural buildings could be formed.

The story that Glenn Milne’s inundation maps tellis that down to about 14,600 years ago Kerama remained attached to the southernend of Okinawa by a thick, curving tongue of land.

Indeed, it is on these now inundated plains off its south-westerncoast that Okinawa’s own underwater monuments – the ‘step-pyramids’ and‘terraces’ off-shore of Chatan, described in chapter 1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01] – are located. And at that time therewas continuous land between Chatan and Kerama …Looking further through the inundation sequence we find that by 13,500 years agothe Kerama-to-Okinawa land-bridge had been severed and 20 kilometres of waterlay between the two. But it is also clear that Kerama at that time had not yetbroken up into smaller units. Further detail is difficult to resolve, but themaps indicate that this single, larger Kerama may have survived, with minimaldiminution, until as late as 10,000, perhaps even 9000, years ago – though sinceparts of it were steeply sloping, and parts flat, not all of it would have beensubmerged at the same moment even then. It would have been around this time,9000–10,000 years ago, that Kerama’s stone circles would have been inundated.The circles lie under almost 30 metres of water, 10 kilometres south-east of Akaisland, at the intersection of latitude 26 degrees 07 minutes north andlongitude 127 degrees 17 minutes east. A few jagged rocks just break the surfacenear by, with waves constantly crashing over them, but otherwise the site iscompletely exposed in open water.THE CONSTRAINTSKERAMA, MARCH 2001The March 2001 dives with Wolf Wichmann were funded and filmed by Channel 4 on arushed, money-saving schedule – two working days for Yonaguni, and one forKerama. In practice this meant that if the weather turned sour – which itfrequently does in the Ryukyus – we would not be able to dive at Kerama at all.And even if the weather god was with us, the sea god might not be: the currentsat Kerama are often so severe that you have to fight the water continuously ifyou want to stay in one place.When humans fight water, water wins. I’ve seen divers lose their masks and havetheir regulators pulled from their mouths by the Kerama currents. I’ve seendesperate, breathless struggles to stay on top of the site, or to help othersstay there, and not get swept away into the wild blue yonder. I’ve seen fityoung adults crawl back on to the boat exhausted, literally trembling withfatigue. So what I’ve learned, after several unpleasant experiences of thatsort, is that it’s just not worth diving there when the current flows. It’sbetter to anchor the boat tight with a couple of lines fore and aft, put a buoyin the water, watch how it bobs, and wait for a lull.If there’s a lull.BRIEFINGKERAMA, MARCH 2001We set out from Okinawa soon after 9 a.m. on what turned out to be a reasonablyfine morning with waves of less than a metre. Once again we were working withthe great local diver Isamu Tsukahara and his very professional team, and usinghis fast, spacious cabin cruiser as our dive boat. Mitsutoshi Taniguchi, theoriginal discoverer of the circles, had come up to join us from his home onMiyako island further to the south. And Kiyoshi Nagaki had also volunteered todive with us that day.We began to sight the Keramas after about an hour of steady running to the west,and as we drew closer Wolf explained to me their basic structure evident fromareas of bare rock along the coasts and from scars left by earthfalls that haduncovered the underlying strata in the hills. Rather like Malta in the far-offMediterranean, it seemed that these islands had been formed out of huge depositsof coralline limestone (i.e., corals turned to rock) that had been laid downunder ancient seas as much as 50 million or 100 million years ago and thensubsequently exposed and inundated again, exposed and inundated again, with morecoral growth taking place in the epochs of inundation but later itself beingfossilized and exposed. In some places sedimentary layers of softer limestones,comparable to Malta’s globigerina layers, lay on top of a coralline core. Inothers coralline outcrops formed the surface layer itself, glaring white in themorning sunlight.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_214_r1.jpg]Plan drawing of Kerama’s stone circles and associated structures. Based onKimura.By 10.30 a.m. we were manoeuvring into position over the dive site. IsamuTsukahara – who always takes the hardest work on himself – went down to set theanchors and the buoy. This must have required an almost superhuman effort on hispart, since the current was flowing strongly enough to create visible turbulenceon the surface, but he calmly and capably succeeded and was soon back on boardnone the worse for wear. Then we all sat around and waited, listening to thecreaking anchor ropes as the current tried to rip the boat free and send itspinning back to Okinawa. The buoy, rather distressingly, had been suckedcompletely underwater by the force of the flow, and no diving was going to getdone before it popped back up again.In the meantime I borrowed a DVC player and monitor from the film crew so that Icould show Wolf some footage that Santha and I had shot during previous dives atCentre Circle, the largest of the group of structures that lay scattered aroundon the ocean floor beneath our boat. Every instinct in my body, for years now,had convinced me that these structures must be man-made, or at any rate couldnot have been made entirely by nature – they were simply too bizarre, unique and‘designed’. But secretly I had some doubts. I’ve learned a fair bit about rocksand reefs underwater around the world since I took up diving, but I’m not amarine geologist and there’s a huge amount I don’t know. Could it be possiblethat the strange pillars, the clear pentagonal pathway around the centralmonolith, and the shaped rock-surround of Centre Circle had all come about as aresult of some natural process of which I was ignorant?I froze the frame at an oblique view from the north-western side of the circle,shot in mid-water about 10 metres above the tops of the megaliths, and pointedout the central monolith to Wolf.GH: So this is the top of the central stone or whatever it is, which is thensurrounded by a ring of …Wolf: It’s a canyon. It’s a sort of canyon.GH: It’s a sort of canyon, and it runs down into quite a clean-edged pathwayround the bottom here at about 27 metres … it’s a curious mixture of pebbles andsand in the bottom. But it’s very clean; there’s nothing growing in the bottomat all.Wolf [pointing out several of the monoliths): All these single structures aretotally overgrown by organisms. So just to have an impression of how they couldhave been shaped or could have originated, you have to scratch lots off them …Do you have any impression about the core material of these?GH: It seems to be a mixture of largish, I wouldn’t say pebbles, I’d say morelike cobbles, you know …Wolf: Rounded?GH: Rounded … in a, in a sort of concretized mixture of something – I don’t knowwhat it is – a rocky, stony mixture.Wolf: A matrix.GH: A matrix, yeah. And you can see —Wolf: So the question to answer is – is the core material consisting of the samematrix and pebbles mixture? Or are the glued pebbles inside this matrix just anouter cover?GH: On top of something else.Wolf: Yes. And the only way to find this out is to make some core drillings orsomething like that. Another way to come closer to the solution of that riddle,that mystery, could be to scratch off the sand on the bottom to see how thesestructures are linked to the ground rock … But what you definitely have to seeis the core, the base, of these single structures and how they are fixed to theground —GH: So shall we plan to go to the bottom first, and do some of that? You mayfind that there’s some samples that you can get. Have a close look at everythingdown there and, you know, see if you feel that these kind of curves – the waythe outer and the inner curves of the big monoliths match each other – can benatural or can be man-made.Wolf: So, as far as I can see now, I have really no explanation for this type ofpattern.GH: Here for example (pointing to screen). You can clearly see we’re lookingdown on two parallel curved walls …Wolf: Right, right. That’s very amazing. So, is the distance between those twowalls broad enough to let people walk through?GH: Yes, yes it is. You can almost, in places, put two divers side by side, butnot quite. Well, we’ll see when we get down there.I played the tape forward a few frames, then stopped it at a change of scene-the second circle of great monoliths. Because it is of narrower diameter (notbecause of the size of its monoliths, which are much the same) local divers callit ‘Small Centre Circle’. It lies immediately north-east of and adjoins CentreCircle itself, creating in effect two interlinked rings, the first 8 metresacross and the second 5 metres across, contained within what appears to be ahuge keyhole-shaped enclosure hewn somehow out of the bedrock that now forms thefloor of the ocean.Wolf: So, how many circles are there in all?GH: Well, there’s these two side by side; one large one and one slightly smallerone. Then there’s a third one I guess about 50 or 60 metres further to thenorth-west, but we don’t have shots of that.Wolf: Yes. And are there other figures? Different from this circle?GH: In the same area, about 40 metres away to the south, there are quite anumber of other circles made of much smaller individual stones, most of them nomore than a metre in length. We should be able to look at some of those circlestoo, on the same dive.Wolf: But they are built up the same way, of the same material?GH: Well, they look like some of the cobbles that are compacted into the biggermonoliths.Wolf: Aha … aha.GH: They look like that kind of —Wolf: Single cobbles?GH: Single cobbles.Wolf: And then positioned …?GH: But positioned in a ring.Wolf: That’s strange.GH: It is.Wolf: Really strange.I rewound the tape for a few moments then pressed ‘play’ again. There was onecharacteristic of Centre Circle which, though obvious enough, I’d so farforgotten to point out to Wolf.GH: The other thing I feel about it is it’s on a human scale. It’s monumental,and yet the scale of the thing is human.Wolf: I’m very astonished about that … about the structure, formation. You know,I haven’t seen anything like this before.GH: In years of diving? And nor have I … never anywhere in the world.Wolf: Not only in diving, but also on dry land. There’s some … some formationsat least comparable a bit to this – so-called ‘rock castles’ or even a certainform of calcite weathering. But they look different. They look totally differentand they don’t have these canyons with the straight walls going right down.GH: With straight walls and running all the way round a central stone.Wolf: Normal calcite weathering is different. It has different wall angles.GH: You see it’s … every time I see that, that inner curve matching the curve ofthis and making this rather nice path, I feel …Wolf: It’s very parallely shaped …GH: Yeah, and it feels like a design thing.Wolf: Strange, yes … strange.GH: And no real research has ever been done here. Not even by Professor Kimura.DIVING ON CENTRE CIRCLEFinally, in the early afternoon around 1 p.m., the buoy which had been draggedunder the surface by the force of the current suddenly popped up again, thepressure on the fore and aft anchor ropes went slack, and it was time to godiving. We were already partially geared up, so it took only a few minutes forus to strap on tanks, fins and masks and jump into the water.Tsukahara had positioned the boat well and Centre Circle became clearly visiblebeneath us almost as soon as we were under the surface. There was a smallcurrent still running, not strong enough to trouble us, and we allowed ourselvesto drift slowly down the main anchor line towards the monolithic structuresbelow.The word ‘monolith’ means literally ‘single stone’ and is used to refer to ‘alarge block of stone or anything that resembles one in appearance’.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c29-ftn1] But what troubled me most aboutthe monoliths of Centre Circle – a matter related to my secret fear ofgeological processes known to Wolf but unknown to me – was precisely thequestion of whether they were ‘single stones’ or not. I had never done what Wolfintended to do now, which was to scrape off some of the thick marine growthcovering the monoliths to see what the core material was made of. But I hadhandled them many times and had vaguely arrived at the idea that they mustconsist through and through of the same sort of concretized or aggregated‘matrix’ of rounded mid-sized stones – resembling river stones – that seemed toform their exteriors. The problem was I had absolutely no idea whether this wasgoing to be good, or bad, for the proposition – my ‘theory’ if you like – thatCentre Circle is a man-made structure.In our conversation on deck Wolf had seemed genuinely mystified by the videofootage I’d shown him. But perhaps once he was close up he would take one lookat the monoliths, chisel out a few samples, and prove beyond argument that theyhad in fact been formed by entirely natural processes. Perhaps he would evenslap himself on the brow as we got back in the boat and announce the obscure butcorrect geological name for this kind of ‘natural formation’. Or perhaps hewouldn’t. Either way, I’d know for sure in about an hour. That was when itreally dawned on me, I think, that not only Kerama was on trial here but also mywhole notion that a phase of higher civilization and monumental construction inJapanese prehistory might be attested by ruins underwater.Fifteen metres above the top of Centre Circle, as we paused in neutral buoyancyto get a perspective on the edifice, I was glad I’d spent the last couple ofhours going through our earlier video footage of the site – because it hadforced me to think through issues that I had previously overlooked. It wasn’tjust the crucial question of what the monoliths were made of that had to beaddressed, but also Wolf’s observation that they were contained on the floor ofsomething like a ‘canyon’.Looking around from this bird’s eye view – for a diver does have some of thefreedom of manoeuvre in the water that a bird has in the sky – I began to get aproper sense, for the first time, of the topography that surrounds the two greatco-joined circles (Centre Circle and Small Centre Circle) and of how theirkeyhole-shaped perimeter is formed, and even of the relationships between thefully detached and ‘semi-detached’ monoliths that make up the circles.All these structures occupy the summit of a very large, gently sloping outcropof rock extending away in all directions, gradually disappearing into deeperwaters. At the end of the Ice Age, when the outcrop last stood above sea-level,its highest point would have been the place now marked by the top of the centralmonolith of Centre Circle. From there you could have stood and surveyed theentire area around.But then – it seemed inescapable – some powerful force must have intervened,perhaps organized human beings, perhaps weird nature, and carved out theflat-floored, sheer-walled, semi-subterranean, keyhole-shaped enclosure nowcontaining the great rock uprights that form the two circles. Marine growth hadgnarled and knobbled the contours of the uprights and it would not be clearuntil the growth was scraped off how smooth and clean-cut – or otherwise —theyoriginally might have been.I knew that Wolf would be looking for a natural explanation and supposed thatmuch depended on the constitution of the rock. This, hopefully, we would soon beable to establish since he had brought along with him a fearsome little hammerand mesh bags for the collection of samples. Once we had a better idea of thecore material, however, the question we had to address ourselves to – the onlyquestion in town really – was what sort of force could have produced an amazing‘design’ like this. Despite lingering doubts, I felt a sudden surge ofconfidence that nature could not have done it – not unaided anyway. On thecontrary, the pattern was a complex and a purposive one, rather difficult toexecute in any kind of rock, and the more I studied it the more obvious itseemed that it was deliberate and planned.With reference to photo 78 the reader will note that directly beneath the diver,on the north side of Centre Circle, is the smallest and lowest of the threecompletely free-standing uprights. What I noticed for the first time thatafternoon was that this ‘broken monolith’, as I had thought of it before, formsthe beginning of a definite anti-clockwise spiral extending through the top ofthe next monolith (much higher) and of the next (higher still), then windingaround the west and south sides of the central upright, where it takes on thecurve of the surrounding enclosure wall – itself not continuous but segregatedinto units separated by deep channels.The dividing line between Centre Circle and Small Centre Circle is formed by thesame low upright where the spiral begins. I swam over it now and looked down onit from the north side with Small Centre Circle just below me. I believe that itshows every sign, as does the entire structure, of having been carved and shapedby man. Though it is a small detail, I have always been impressed by the way itis curved on one side to match the outer curve of the big central upright to itssouth and on the other to match the curve of the only slightly smaller uprightbehind it to its north. It is also difficult to imagine how the narrow,clean-edged ‘second pathway’ that parallels the wider inner pathway around thecentral upright could have been cut so precisely by any natural force.Just before we dropped down into the structure I noticed out of the corner of myeye, thanks to the exceptional visibility that afternoon, something I had notseen since our first dives here back in 1999. This was the existence, not farbeyond the south-western perimeter of Centre Circle – on the slopes below thesummit of the ancient mound – of other circles and ovals and spirals made up ofindividual stones, large cobbles, boulders, mostly a metre or less in length,all of them rounded and smoothed off at the edges, coiled and intertwined witheach other like necklaces or the links of a chain strewn upon the ground. As Ihad told Wolf earlier, they looked a lot, though not exactly, like the ‘riverstones’ that were also weirdly stuck, or aggregated (or formed part of thebedrock itself?) all over the uprights of Centre Circle.I made a mental note that we should go and take a proper look at these nearby‘river-stone’ or ‘river-boulder’ circles and try to figure out how they had beenformed. Perhaps Wolf would have a sensible geological explanation. But seeingthem again for the first time in two years, and having travelled widely overlandin Japan since then, they instantly reminded me of the Jomon stone circles suchas Komakino Iseki and Oyu that I had visited in the north of Honshu in May 2000.So far as I could remember, those circles too had been fashioned out of riverstones and river boulders like these, and disposed upon the ground in exactlythe same way.It was potentially an important connection.By now Wolf and I had reached the base of Centre Circle and were standing up onthe inner pathway examining the monoliths. It was true, as Wolf had observedfrom the video footage, that they were completely overgrown with a fantasticmenagerie of marine organisms. But at the same time, protruding out through themlike a harvest of ripe fruit, was this peculiar matrix of individual rivercobbles. One that I noticed in particular, about the diameter of a large dinnerplate and probably weighing several kilos, jutted sideways from the top of thesecond monolith in the spiral as though reaching out towards the third. How wasthis to be explained?Wolf took samples from some of the more prominent river stones plastered to theexteriors of the uprights, then beckoned me to join him at the foot of thesecond monolith under the overhanging cobble. This was going to be his attemptto find out what the core material of the monolith was made of – and he showedme how the marine growth thinned out then stopped altogether at the junctionwith the basal path. Immediately above the path it proved relatively easy -mucheasier than we had expected – to scrape away a large patch of organisms andbegin to expose the core.Wolf scraped and scraped. Scraped and scraped. And gradually what emerged wasnot, as I had feared, more of the same stony matix or aggregate that clung tothe surface, but rather a hard, bright, white core formed unmistakably of theancient coralline limestone of the Keramas and fully attached at its base to thebedrock. So far as we were able to make out, the monolith appeared to have beensmoothly and perfectly cut down from top to bottom with a beautiful curveincorporated into it to match the curve of the pathways that were defined oneither side of it and the curve of the central upright. I could even see, whereWolf had scraped away the growth particularly successfully, the originalorganisms that had fossilized millions of years ago to form the white coral rockout of which the entire perimeter of the circle and all its uprights had laterbeen cut. Coral rock where it is available is an ideal construction material –and from the little stone blocks used to build private houses in the Maldivestoday, to the massive ‘Trilithion’ of ancient Tonga, to the megalithic templesof Malta, you can see the use of white coralline limestones in which thestructure of the ancient fossilized organisms can clearly be made out.I was grateful to Wolf for having done this little and obvious thing – obvious,anyway to a professional geologist – i.e., for having established what the corematerial of Centre Circle’s monoliths actually is. Because this kind ofcoralline limestone, as well as being visually and aesthetically striking, isalso extremely hard. For a natural force to have cut such a material in such acomplex way with sheer walls 4 metres deep, and with parallel curves andpathways – the whole hewn out as a semi-subterranean enclosure in the summit ofan ancient mound – was, it seemed to me, something that Wolf was going to findvery difficult to explain.Half an hour later we were back on the boat. The principal underwater camerathat the Channel 4 team had been using to shoot the dive had malfunctioned, andthe director needed us to do it all again. But it was now after 2.30, thecurrent had returned with a vengeance during the last fifteen minutes of thefirst dive, and it didn’t look like we’d be able to get back in the water atall. We decided to sit at anchor until five. Diving much after that, withnightfall coming, would not be safe this far out in the open ocean and we’d haveto return to Okinawa with what we’d got. But if the current slackened before,then we would attempt a second dive.WHERE HAS ALL THE DEBRIS GONE?We did get our second dive when miraculously, just after 4.30, the buoy poppedup from out of the current again. The light below was surprisingly good and wespent a useful forty-five minutes underwater. Certain scenes were shot with mein which Wolf was not needed – during these he went happily off exploring on hisown. In other scenes we repeated for the camera what we’d done for real thefirst time around. Again Wolf scraped off growth from the base of a CentreCircle monolith and exposed the sheer white coralline limestone beneath. Again Ifound myself fascinated by this bright underlying stone, cut from almost exactlythe same sort of material as the most ancient and enduring megalithic structuresof far-off Malta.Indeed, by visualizing a Maltese temple like Hagar Qim or Gigantija in all itsglory, its white coralline limestone megaliths reflecting the dazzlingMediterranean sunshine, I could begin to imagine how the two great rock-hewncircles of Kerama might have looked, in all their glory-, when all this area asfar east as Okinawa was above water at the end of the Ice Age.As you approached them from lower down the gentle slopes of the surroundingrocky massif – all of it formed out of the same 100-million-year-old fossilizedcoral reef-you would at first have not been aware that any structures werepresent there at all. Only from the rim of the enclosure looking down would youhave suddenly found yourself confronted by a majestic and mysterious spiral ofglowing monoliths, the tallest more than twice the height of a tall man.Unlike the uprights of the great Maltese temples, however, which were quarriedelsewhere and then transported and erected on the temple sites, these CentreCircle monoliths had been quarried in situ out of the bedrock of the ancientmound – to which they were still attached at their bases.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c29-ftn2] That automatically classifies thewhole edifice as a rock-hewn structure and, as at Yonaguni, one of the mysteriesit confronts us with, if we are to imagine that the ‘hewing’ was done by naturalforces, is – what happened to all the missing rock? The reader may easily verifyfrom photos 78–80 that quite a large amount of this very hard rock would havehad to be hewn out to free-up the monoliths and excavate the 4-metre-deepsemi-subterranean enclosure in which they are confined. As the photographs alsoshow, none of this excavated rock is present as any form of rubble or debriswithin the two circles. This is a very troubling anomaly if the circles weremade by natural forces, but is exactly what one would expect if they are thework of human beings.WOLF ON KERAMAMuch to my surprise – because I had become so used to his hard-nosed scepticismat Yonaguni – Wolf stayed as open-minded on the problem of Centre Circle afterour two dives as he had been when I’d shown him the tapes before we got in thewater. Moreover, he was able to carry out on-board chemical tests on the samplesthat he had taken both from the core and from the aggregate of river stonesplastered to the outside of the monoliths.The tests proved on camera – though it was already completely obvious to thenaked eye – that these were two entirely different types of rock. The core, aswe knew, was very ancient coralline limestone. The rounded cobbles caught up inthe aggregate were sandstone and had, as Wolf judged:been shaped by waters, by running waters; this is beyond every doubt. Thesesandstones all show a rounded-out shape, and this leads us to two possibleorigination processes for these stones: one would be riverine waters, and theother one would be coastline beach, pebbles or something like that, which havebeen rolled forward and backward to get this rounded shape.Wolf added that during the second dive, while I had been working with thecameraman, he had explored outside the perimeter of Centre Circle.What was special for me was to discover that these rather large cobbles, pebblestones, made of sandstone, which are glued to the uprights and inner formations,also appear in places outside the circle. So I dived a little sidewards – Idon’t know the direction – and then I found a field of the same pebbles, notreally pebbles, it was really big, big stones, but scattered in a very chaoticway over the surface of the coralline bedrock.Wolf’s suggestion about these ‘pebbles’ of assorted sizes – which we alsoreferred to in our conversations variously as boulders, cobbles and river stones– was the obvious one but, he warned, a pure guess. At some stage, probablymillions of years after the fossilization and exposure of the ancient coralbedrock,a river has carried his load here … So maybe it sometimes had water andsometimes it dried out, changed the bed, and left the stones in here … So itseems that parts of this old coral reef were covered by these boulders somehowtransported by river, a very broad river, because the field seems to me to bevery broad.If it was a guess, it sounded like a good one.But on the larger mystery of the monoliths and uprights of the rock-hewn circlesWolf admitted that he was completely dumbfounded – although he rightly cautionedthat he could only speak from his own experience as a marine geologist. Perhapsother geologists had seen natural structures that were the same as or verysimilar to Centre Circle somewhere in the world and would be able explain theenigmatic curved parallel walls and well-shaped uprights. He could not, however.Wolf: I have no explanation for these … for these …GH: For the circles?Wolf: For the circles, and for the structures inside them. For sure is that theymust have been formatted after the pebbles were laid down on the corallineground – because some of these pebbles are hanging over the canyons, so and theycould not have come earlier … But I don’t see any force which could have shapedthese —GH: —any force of nature, which could shape the circles and uprights?Wolf: Yes, of course.GH: So that leaves us …Wolf: At the moment …GH: That leaves us with one option then? Man-made.Wolf: I don’t know. I would not be …GH: You wouldn’t rush so fast?Wolf: I would not go so far. I mean you have to do really a lot of research toestablish that. But what is really strange is these parallel walls runninground. It is very strange because if, for example, the erosive force were water,the two edges of a river bed or something like that are not exactly parallel toeach other like these. So this is what I can say. And even solution, chemicalsolution does not leave hints like this, of this accuracy.GH: Paralleling of walls?Wolf: Paralleling accuracy.GH: So what can be said for sure about this structure? Can we be sure aboutanything?Wolf: What is clear is that we have an ancient fossilized coral reef and we havethese pebbles scattered on top of it which came later. And then a second forcestarted. This was the erosive force which then carved these structures out ofthe ground – if man or if nature.GH: Now, you geologists will say ‘carved by nature’ and we poets will say‘carved by man’.Wolf: I don’t say anything definite. Much more research must be done. But Iagree that this is very amazing and very strange, even to me, how thesestructural buildings could be formed. I haven’t seen such structures done bynature. I won’t dare say anything else about human activities because I do notknow anything about that.From a geologist as instinctively cautious and phlegmatic as Wolf Wichmann thiswas as close as I was ever likely to get to a confirmation that the rock-hewnstone circles of Kerama really could be man-made. Still, I couldn’t resistpushing for more.GH: I’ll tell you why I think it’s man-made.Wolf: Yes, please.GH: It’s not just the sense of organization of the structure itself. It’s thefact that we have an ancient culture on these islands which made stone circles.They are known to have made stone circles and some of those circles stillsurvive – not like Centre Circle, smaller, with the largest blocks about half atonne, and usually much less. But the idea of a stone circle and, indeed, ofinterlinked stone circles, was something they did. So you know, when we look atCentre Circle and Small Centre Circle -and we know that we’re on a set ofislands where we have an ancient culture called the Jomon, who are known to havemade stone circles -then to me it’s less extraordinary, in a way, to attributeit to them – to the Jomon – than it is to any unknown force of nature. I don’tdeny that nature often provides a sense of organization, but it’s the uniquecharacter of this in a land where we have a very ancient culture, actually whichexisted from 16,000 years ago until 2,000 years ago, the Jomon, who made stonecircles … you know, I start wondering.Wolf: OK, I can follow your point. But still it has to be proven that this isreally done by the Jomon.GH: Yes, yes, I agree.Wolf: And this is very hard to find. You have to scratch and you have to cleanit to find marks or to find any evidence, maybe in a series of other monumentsbeing proven to have been constructed by this society.GH: Yes. Well, we have many stone circles that have been constructed by thatsociety, but this … amongst their stone circles, this would rank as the largestand the most unusual. But I repeat, we’re on a set of islands here which had anancient culture, the Jomon, that is recognized by historians. The earliestsurviving work of that ancient culture goes back to the Ice Age, around 16,000years ago. The Jomon were known to make stone circles. We have a stone circle ata depth that is likely to have been exposed at some point during the Ice Age.What’s the next logical step?Wolf: No, no, I mean I agree to that, to that chain, to that chain – it’s clear.But the last point … this is the point that you must prove. A theory remains atheory unless you have proof.What I had at that moment was a theory about possible Jomon origins for theunderwater monoliths and circles of Kerama, hinting at an early and as yetundiscovered phase of monumental construction in Jomon prehistory. That theoryhad just passed a very important hurdle, since an on-site investigation by asceptical marine geologist had been unable to produce any viable naturalexplanation for the structures.But it was still a theory.KOMAKINO ISEKI UNDERWATER?Having completed our work at Kerama, we parted company with Wolf the nextmorning. He flew back to Germany, and Santha and I carried on with the film crewto the north of Japan. There, eventually, we found ourselves at the wonderfulJomon stone circle of Komakino Iseki (see chapter 25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c25_r1.htm#c25]) near the big site of Sannai-Muryama inAomori Prefecture. Though it was by now late March, the weather was stillfreezing in the north, old snow was still lying on the ground and the wholescene presented a huge contrast to the tropical warmth and blue waters ofKerama.While the crew were setting up, I paced amongst the stones, shivering with cold.The distinctive, rounded river stones of Komakino Iseki. Boulders, pebbles,cobbles, arranged in a series of concentric circles, the largest with a diameterof 150 metres. And between the rings, groups of smaller circles, touching at theedges like the links of a chain …[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_215_r1.jpg]I’d already made the connection underwater a few days earlier at Kerama. It hadstruck me as important then and I’d meant to look into it further with Wolf buthad been prevented from doing so by shortage of time. It was the phenomenon thathe had noticed independently when he’d gone off exploring on his own while I wasworking with the cameraman and which he’d later described as a boulder field –‘big stones disposed in a very chaotic way over the surface of the corallinebedrock’. But if I was right, the disposal of these big rounded river stones wasnot nearly so chaotic as Wolf had thought. I was pretty sure that I had seen his‘boulder field’ too, and even videoed it briefly in 1999, and glimpsed it againon the first of the two dives we had just completed.And where he had seen chaos I had seen order. Because when I had filmed them in1999 some of the big rounded river stones scattered across the coralline plainhad definitely been arranged in circles, one stone laid lengthwise next to theother. As at Komakino Iseki, I remembered, these ‘circles’ were really more ovalthan truly circular in shape (though I shall continue to refer to them ascircles for convenience). And as at Komakino Iseki, the stones had beenmedium-sized – typically around a metre in length or less.So Kerama still wasn’t finished with me. On this latest trip, as on everyprevious trip, I had failed to do my job there properly. I’d been lured in bythe glamour of the rock-hewn circles with their 4-metre-high monoliths. But Icould see now how the proof of the Jomon connection I sought might all alonghave been lying in that humble ‘boulder field’ just beyond.I was going to have to go back."},{"pageContent":"30 / THE SHARK AT THE GATEThe origin of maps and geographical treatises goes far back into former ages.Phei Hsiu, Chinese geographer, AD 224–71The earliest surviving reference to Taiwan in Chinese annals is in the Sui-Shu –the history of the Sui Dynasty, AD 581–618.1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn1] There it is classified amongstthe Lu-Chu islands – the old Chinese name for what is now (with the exception ofTaiwan) Japan’s Ryukyu archipelago.2[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn2] Starting at Yonaguni in thesouth-west – within sight of the mountains of Taiwan on a clear day – theLu-Chu/Ryukyus extend through the Keramas and Okinawa almost as far to thenorth-east as Kyushu, and have been under discontinuous Japanese hegemony sincethe fourteenth century. However, they did not officially become part of Japanuntil 1879.3 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn3] It is thereforeintriguing that very ancient Japanese legends ‘definitely place R’yugu, the SeaKing’s sanctuary, in the Lu-Chu Islands’.4[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn4]The Japanese notion of the Sea-King’s sanctuary, which the Nihongi calls ‘thePalace of the God of the Sea’5 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn5]and the Kojiki calls ‘the Palace of the Kami Great-Ocean-Possessor’,6[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn6] is a rather complicated one. Aswe saw in chapter 26 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c26_r1.htm#c26], its primarymythical setting is underwater, amidst huge stone structures looming up from thesea-bed, in a place that can only be reached by diving. But it also has elusiveconnections to an enchanted ‘Spirit island’, accessed by a magical journeyacross the sea, where human life dilates towards immortality – or so we maygather from the story of the man who spent three years residing there and thenreturned to his home only to discover that 300 human years had passed. Last butnot least, there seems to be an enigmatic link with the dark and terrifyingUnderworld of the Land of Yomi where the soul of Izanami fled after her death.7[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn7]When we turn to the traditions and mythology of ancient China we find the sameingredients – immortality, enchanted islands, the Underworld – often used in thesame way. Thus, the oldest dynastic history, the Shih Chi (completed about 90BC), tells us of voyages – sent to the same general area of the ‘Great EasternOcean’ that is occupied by the Ryukyus – in search of magical islands where theinhabitants were immortals thanks to their possession of ‘the drug which willprevent death’.8 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn8] And in anothertext, the Ling Wai Tai Ta, we read how ‘In the Great Eastern Ocean there is abank of sand and rocks some myriads of li in length, and nearby is the Wei-Lei,the place where the water pours down into the Nine Underworlds.’9[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn9][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_216_r1.jpg]Since a li is equivalent to 0.309 of a mile,10[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn10] then thousands of li (say 3000of them?) must equal at least a thousand miles. One wonders where in the EasternOcean – i.e., the Pacific – such an enormous bank of rock and sand could havebeen located.But perhaps it would be better to ask: when?ABODES OF THE IMMORTALSThe Wei-Lei – which might be translated politely as ‘the ultimate drain’11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn11] – has another, more beautiful,name in Japan. There it is called the Kuroshio, the Black Current or the BlackTide,12 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn12] and we saw in chapter 25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c25_r1.htm#c25] how serious scholars at the SmithsonianInstitution led by Betty Meggers believe that it may have carried Jomonseafarers all the way across the Pacific to settle in the Americas more than5000 years ago.13 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn13] There are evenindications of earlier Jomon migrations to the Americas going back as far as15,000 years ago.14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn14]I first set eyes on the Black Current – and you really can see it; it’s anentity; it’s alive; it is, I guess, a Kami – from the heights of Cape Ashizurion the Japanese island of Shikoku, where groups of great megaliths stand gazingdown on the rippling waters as though sharing a secret.15[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn15] We know already that from therethe Kuroshio runs north past the rest of the Japanese archipelago and thenceacross the Pacific. South of Shikoku and Kyushu, however, it also flows pastTaiwan and the Ryukyu islands immediately to the east of the Chinese coast – theregion of the Pacific most directly accessible to Chinese mariners.16[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn16] Could it have been somewherehereabouts that the ancient Chinese believed ‘the Wei-Lei drains into the worldfrom which men do not return’?17 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn17]The distinguished Sinologist Joseph Needham thought it should be further east-perhaps even as far east as the Americas,18[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn18] a quasi-diffusionist view thatwas ahead of its time in 1971 when he expressed it. But there is no consensus.Needham also attributed definite historicity to Chinese accounts of searches formagical islands.19 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn19] The Shih Chireports the exploits of a mariner named Hsu Fu, in the late third century BC.Rather like Columbus petitioning the sovereigns of Europe 1700 years later tofund his voyages of discovery westwards across the Atlantic in search ofAntilia,20 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn20] Hsu Fu petitioned theemperor of China in 219 BC with claims to have special knowledge of a wonderfuldomain of ‘magic mountain islands’ to the east of China in the Pacific:In the midst of the Eastern Sea there are three magic mountain islands, PhengLai, Fang-Chang and Ying-Chou, inhabited by immortals. We beg to be authorizedto put to sea … to go and look for the abodes of the immortals hidden in theEastern Ocean.21 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn21]The target of this voyage, which did receive the emperor’s blessing, is statedto be far off ‘in the midst of the Eastern Sea’, but again there is no consensusas to its location. Hsu Fu went to look for it with a well-stocked fleet, saidto have been carrying large numbers of young men and women and ‘ample suppliesof the seeds of the five grains’22[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn22] – which suggests settlementplans. The Shih Chi records that he ‘never came back to China’.23[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn23] But confusingly, the samechronicle also reports other voyages – equally fruitless in terms of anydefinite discovery – which sought the same islands much closer to the Chinesecoast:From the time of the Kings of Chhi [c.378 BC] … people were sent out into theocean to search for the islands of Pheng Lai, Fang-Chang and Ying-Chou. Thesethree holy mountain isles were reported to be in the midst of Po-Hai [the Gulfof Bo Hai], not so distant from human habitations … Many immortals live there,and the drug which will prevent death (pu ssu chih yao) is found there, but thedifficulty [is] that … before you have reached them … these three holy mountainisles sink down below the water – or else a wind suddenly drives the ship awayfrom them. So no one can really reach them …24[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn24]CONVERGENCEAll taken together it seems fair to say that the Chinese myths contain very muchthe same sort of strange brew as do their Japanese counterparts – of an entranceto the Underworld, of enchanted islands and of kingdoms beneath the sea. Butwhere Japanese traditions specify the location of the Kingdom of the Sea-King asbeing somewhere in the Lu-Chu islands, Chinese references to Pheng Lai,Fang-Chang and Ying-Chou, ‘the islands of the Sea Mage’,25[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn25] are contradictory as to location– varying from Hsu Fu’s unspecified destination in the midst of the PacificOcean to somewhere extremely close to home like the Bo Hai Gulf (which liesbetween the city of Tianjin and Korea Bay at the northern end of the YellowSea).Perhaps the contradiction is less than it seems, however, for Hsu Fu isvenerated as a Kami in Japan. There he is the Kami Jofuku whose tomb-shrineexists to this day at Shingu in Wakayama Prefecture of southern Honshu,26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn26] which, like Cape Ashizuri innearby Shikoku, overlooks the course of the Black Current. If there is truth tothis strange tradition of Hsu Fu’s settlement at Shingu then it suggests thatthe islands of the Sea Mage ‘hidden in the Eastern Ocean’ to which he haddirected his expedition must all along have been somewhere in the vicinity ofsouthern Japan.Although this cannot be confirmed, I suspect that the convergence of myths fromboth China and Japan does hint at something very real – perhaps even a sharedmemory of a lost land with ‘palaces and towers’, once believed to be enchantedand inhabited by ‘immortals’, that now lies beneath the sea.LU-CHU AND BO HAIAnd where are we to look for this lost land, should we wish to rediscover it?Across the two traditions the only clear pointers given to its whereabouts arethat it is to be found somewhere in the Lu-Chu islands – effectively anywherealong the arc from Taiwan to Kyushu – or near the northern terminus of theYellow Sea in the Bo Hai Gulf. These locations are not proximate but are atopposite ends of the same region. Both are highly plausible as potentiallocations for ‘palaces beneath the sea’.At the end of the Ice Age we know that the Ryukyu islands were larger than theyare today. There was therefore ample room along their antediluvian shores forany number of ‘palaces’ to be built – and later submerged as sea-levels rose.Moreover, as I’ve endeavoured to show in the preceding pages, a number ofextraordinary underwater structures that seem increasingly likely to have beenmade by humans at the end of the Ice Age have already been found around theRyukyus.Likewise, if we look at the Bo Hai Gulf on Glenn Milne’s inundation maps, wediscover that it too has an interesting story to tell. Down to 14,600 years agoit was dry and far from the sea (opposite, above). By 13,500 years ago, however,we observe that the Yellow Sea has penetrated deeply inland towards the moderncoast of China and has carved out the Korean peninsula for the first time – butthe Bo Hai Gulf is still dry (opposite, below).Then we come to the map for 12,400 years ago (page 660). In between Shikoku andHonshu we see, still well preserved, the correlation with the Bungo Strait muchas it is portrayed on the 1424 chart. And at the northern end of the Yellow Seawe see that the Bo Hai Gulf has at last succumbed to partial inundation. Withinit, rather strikingly, an island has materialized. Though it is beyond theresolution limits of Milne’s computer model, it is perfectly possible that thesingle island shown could then or at some stage afterwards have been divided upinto three smaller islands exactly as the Shih Chi seems to remember. Either wayits presence in the palaeo-Bo Hai Gulf is intriguing and obliges us to wonderexactly what it was that inspired the Chinese in the third and fourth centuriesBC to make so many real voyages into the Eastern Ocean in search of islands thatdid not exist.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_217_r1.jpg][images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_218_r1.jpg]Could it have been a legacy of ancient maps copied from copies of copies ofcopies of even more ancient maps, the originals of which had been drawn beforethe rising sea-levels at the end of the Ice Age gave the world its post-glacialface? If not, what other explanation is there? After all, the Bo Hai Gulf hasbeen in its present form for at least the last 9000 years – so what possiblereason could the chronicler of the Shih Chi around 90 BC have had to imaginethat there could ever have been any dry land in it, let alone a group ofislands? Why should the Chinese have gone to such lengths to seek out thoseislands – over a period of two centuries – when it was plainly such a fruitlessenterprise? And must we resort to ‘coincidence’ again to explain what appears tobe a piece of truly anachronistic geographical knowledge in the possession ofthe mariners who pursued the search – i.e., that an island or islands, whichcould never be found because it had sunk beneath the waves, did once exist inthe Gulf of Bo Hai?Think about it. What are the odds against the Chinese seafarers of 2300 yearsago getting their palaeo-geography so right purely by chance? Or we can come atthe question from another direction? How likely is it that China’s historicalquest for the three ‘holy mountain isles’ in the Gulf of Bo Hai was inspired bymeaningless myths – as orthodox historians must conclude – when we now know thatan island or islands did exist in the Gulf of Bo Hai 12,400 years ago and didsubsequently ‘sink down below the water’ as the Shih Chi maintains?[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_219_r1.jpg]The palaeo-island was gone within 1800 years, as we see on the next inundationmap in the sequence (for 10,600 years ago, above). The maps also show that theentire span of the island’s existence did not exceed 3000 years, since it hadnot yet taken shape 13,500 years agoAnd though the Shih Chi does not give us a written description of thepalaeo-geography of the Yellow Sea for 13,500 years ago (as it seems to for12,400 years ago), it is a remarkable anomaly of history that something lookingvery much like a graphic representation of the Yellow Sea and its coastline13,500 years ago has survived. Now kept in the ‘Forest of Steles’ in Xian, it isa good Chinese map (Needham describes it as ‘magnificent’),27[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn27] carved in stone in AD 1137,called the Hua I Thu (‘Map of China and the Barbarian Countries’).28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn28] In a refrain familiar from ourinvestigation of the sometimes strangely anachronistic portolans of the West itis known to have been based on older sources.29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn29] Nobody can be absolutely surehow much older. But if ever there was a land in which we might expect toencounter an ancient map-making tradition, then that land is surely China.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_220_r1.jpg]Hua I Thu Chinese map of AD 1137.At around the time that the maps attributed to Marinus of Tyre were beingcirculated in the Mediterranean, a great Chinese geographer, Chang Heng (AD78–139) was producing maps of unbelievably high quality in China. Like Marinus,he is often credited by historians with having introduced a grid system for maps– it being said of him that he had ‘cast a network of coordinates about heavenand earth, and reckoned on the basis of it’. The title of one of his lost bookswas ‘Discourse on Net Calculations’ and there was also a ‘Bird’s-Eye Map’.30[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn30]It is clear, however, that Chang Heng, who is considered one of the ‘fathers’ ofscientific cartography in China, must himself have been the ‘son’ of a muchearlier and older tradition – for one does not reach his level of sophisticationwithout a vast store of prior knowledge and experience to build upon. That sucha store or archive did exist, and that it did contain extremely ancientmaterial, is confirmed in the dynastic chronicles which also give prominence tothe works of another great Chinese geographer, Phei Hsiu (AD 224–271):Phei Hsiu made a critical study of ancient texts, rejected what was dubious[outdated by climate change?], and classified, whenever he could, the ancientnames which had disappeared [because inundated?]; finally composing ageographical map in 18 sheets. He presented it to the emperor, who kept it insecret archives.31 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn31]The chronicles also cite the full text of Phei Hsiu’s preface to his Atlas, inwhich he laments the loss of geographical knowledge from earlier times (emphasesadded):The origin of maps and geographical treatises goes far back into former ages.Under the three dynasties [Hsia, Shang and Chou,32[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn32] c. 2000–1000 BC]33[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn33] there were special officials forthis [Kuo Shih). Then when the Han people sacked Hsien-yang, Hsiao Ho collectedall the maps and documents of the Chhin. Now it is no longer possible to findthe old maps in secret archives, and even those which Hsiao Ho found aremissing; we have only maps, both general and local, from the later Han time.None of these employs a graduated scale (fen lu) and none of them is arranged ina rectangular grid.34 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn34]The implication is not only archives of maps going back thousands of years butalso that the rectangular grid was known very early in Chinese history, thenfell into disuse under the Han in the first millennium BC, and was then laterreintroduced by Chang Heng, the contemporary of Marinus of Tyre, when he casthis ‘network of coordinates about heaven and earth’.So we have a confirmed cartographic science in China from around 2000 years ago(Chang Heng, Phei Hsiu), and references to an ancestral tradition more than 2000years older than that – which presumably was itself not new in 2000 BC when‘special officials’ already existed dedicated to the archiving and probablycopying of ancient maps.It is against this long background, therefore, which disappears into prehistoryand has no known beginning in China, that we should evaluate the Hua I Thu – theChinese map of AD 1137 said to have been based on older sources – which I haveclaimed shows the Yellow Sea and the Korean peninsula not as they looked in AD1137 but as they looked 13,500 years ago. Although other interesting issues areraised by the Hua I Thu, I will confine my remarks here to the north-easternsegment of the map, around the Yellow Sea. In the diagrams overleaf the readermay compare the Yellow Sea and the Korean peninsula as they appear on a modernmap with the same areas on the inundation map for 13,500 years ago and on theHua I Thu. It will be observed that an excellent level of correspondence does infact exist between the latter two and that the Hua I Thu’s portrayal, though abad one of the Yellow Sea as it looked in 1137 – and as it still looks today –is rather a good one if it represents the Yellow Sea 13,500 years ago.Particularly noticeable is the absence on both the Hua I Thu and the inundationmap of the Shantung peninsula, a prominent feature of the northern end of theYellow Sea, which the rising waters began to carve out some time after 13,000years ago and which took on its modern form about 10,000 years ago.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_221_r1.jpg](Left) The Yellow Sea as shown on the Hua I Thu map of AD 1137.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_222_r1.jpg](Below left) Modern map of the Yellow Sea.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_223_r1.jpg](Below right) The Yellow Sea as it looked 13,500 years ago.Nor can it be claimed that the Chinese of 1137 were simply ignorant of theShantung peninsula. On the contrary we can prove that they knew it very well –because another map, also carved on stone in 1137 and also preserved in theForest of Steles at Xian, shows it very clearly and with great accuracy much asit looks today. Called the Yu Chi Thu (‘Map of the Tracks of Yu’), it too is acopy of an earlier original but, as Joseph Needham observes, ‘has a more modernlook’ than the Hua I Thu and seems to belong ‘to a different tradition’.35[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn35]Could this be because the Hua I Thu’s portrayal of the Yellow Sea was deriveddirectly from a very ancient source map – perhaps stored with many others in theImperial archives – while the Yu Chi Thu incorporates the results of Chinesemaritime expeditions that we know had explored the region thoroughly at least asearly as the third century BC?CUTTING KOREA DOWN TO SIZEDeferring for the moment our parallel interest in the lost islands and sunkenkingdoms of the Ryukyu archipelago, what do we have so far concerning Korea andthe northern end of the Yellow Sea?In summary we have geographical traditions, recorded in the Shih Chi, whichplace the lost ‘islands of the Sea Mage’ in the Bo Hai Gulf. There was an islandin the right place 12,400 years ago. We also have a Chinese map copied fromearlier sources on to stone in AD 1137 that anomalously fails to show theShantung peninsula and that greatly narrows the Yellow Sea between China andKorea. However, there was no Shantung peninsula, and the Yellow Sea was narrowedin exactly this way 13,500 years ago.Reduced to bare essentials, therefore, what the Shih Chi and the Hua I Thu bothproclaim is that Korea was larger in the past than now. This is completely true.Yet as the inundation maps show, the Korean coastline has remained unchanged forthe last 9000 years – having done all its shrinking in the 5000 years prior tothat. It follows that if these are memories of a formerly much larger Korea thenthey must be at least 9000 years old.Japan too preserves such memories – if they are memories. In the Fudoki we readof an exploit of Sosano-wo-no-Mikoto, the great Kami calledBrave-Swift-Impetuous-Male, whom we encountered in chapter 26[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c26_r1.htm#c26]. Seeing that parts of the Koreanpeninsula are much larger than they should be, he removes them, draws them away(‘slowly, slowly, like a river boat’) and sews them on to Japan.36[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn36] I have nothing to say about thelatter part of the myth, but I do think the bit about the subtraction of landfrom Korea is interesting: ‘Perceiving that it had a portion in excess, he tookup a spade, wide and flat like the breast of a maiden, and thrust it into theland, parting it asunder as one cuts the gills of a huge fish, and severingit.’37 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn37]Sosano repeats this process with several other parts of Korea until he issatisfied38 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn38] and, presumably, thepeninsula has taken on its present shape.The myth is called ‘the drawing of the lands’. What it conjures up in my mindare not images of a spade shaped like a maiden’s breast, attractive though theconcept may be, but inundation maps of this area between roughly 14,600 and10,600 years ago. These do show lands being ‘sliced away’ piecemeal as the basinof the Yellow Sea filled up to allow the Korean peninsula to emerge. Therefore,although it may have come about by chance and have no significance whatsoever,what confronts us in this text is another time-capsule of accurate geographicalinformation on the region as it looked during the meltdown of the Ice Age.THE FALLThere are, I think, too many such time-capsules of ancient geography scatteredacross too many sources from too many lands – myths and folklore, maps andtraditions – for every example to be explained away as coincidence. I amconvinced that something must lie behind all this and that the odds are risingin favour of a significant forgotten episode in the story of civilizationlocalized in time at the end of the Ice Age. The hypothesis I have followed,which receives virtually unlimited support from world deluge myths, is that thediscontinuity – some might call it the Fall – was a direct product of episodesof post-glacial flooding and linked cataclysms. So it follows that the evidencefor what we have lost – which might explain how and by whom the world came to bemapped more than 12,000 years ago – should be found on the bottom of the sea.The entire ‘arc’ from Taiwan in the south, north-eastwards through all theislands of the Ryukyu archipelago, brushing the tip of Kyushu, leaping acrossthe Korea Strait and thence into the Yellow Sea, Korea Bay and Bo Hai Bay,encloses an area with enormous potential for underwater discoveries.For me it is an underworld – an ancient domain of forgotten ancestors. Like theothers we have entered in this book – in the Mediterranean, in the Atlantic, inthe Indian Ocean – I believe it will have to be explored thoroughly one day ifwe really want to know the truth about our prehistory.But by March 2001 I was also beginning to feel that I personally had done all Icould to initiate the necessary exploration – and after four years of diving inthe Ryukyus I had every reason to expect that the trip with Wolf Wichmann wouldbe the last I would need to do. As I reported in chapter 29[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c29_r1.htm#c29], however, Komakino Iseki changed mymind. The resemblance of its circles of river stones to the circles of riverstones I’d glimpsed on the sea-bed at Kerama had to be followed up.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_224_r1.jpg]Then came the news that an underwater site had been discovered in Taiwan’sPeng-Hu archipelago – the Pescadores Islands – and my Japanese colleagues and Ibegan to plan a short expedition there for late August 2001. Since Taiwan is soclose to Okinawa, it obviously also made sense to redive Kerama on the sametrip.GETTING FROM BASE-3 TO POINT ‘D’AUGUST 2001, TAIWANWe’re nearing the end of a long story and this is not the place to introduce newcharacters, plots or locations. But I will mention some of the qualities ofTaiwan which place it firmly amongst the usual suspects. * It was isolated from mainland China by rising sea-levels at the end of the Ice Age when huge areas to its west, south and north were massively inundated. * It has rich and extensive indigenous flood myths. * It has megaliths more than 5000 years old positioned on a highly significant geodetic location. * It has underwater ruins.I will not delay the reader with lengthy quotations from the very many Taiwaneseflood myths that were collected from amongst the indigenous population,primarily by Japanese scholars, in the nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies.39 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn39] Typically they tella story of a warning from the gods, the sound of thunder in the sky, terrifyingearthquakes, the pouring down of a wall of water which engulfs mankind, and thesurvival of a remnant who had either fled to mountain tops or who floated tosafety on some sort of improvised vessel.40[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn40]To provide just one example (from the Ami tribe of central Taiwan), we hear howthe four gods of the sea conspired with two gods of the land, Kabitt and Aka, todestroy mankind. The gods of the sea warned Kabitt and Aka: ‘In five days whenthe round moon appears, the sea will make a booming sound: then escape to amountain where there are stars.’ Kabitt and Aka heeded the warning immediatelyand fled to the mountain and ‘when they reached the summit, the sea suddenlybegan to make the sound and rose higher and higher’.41[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn41] All the lowland settlements wereinundated but two children, Sura and Nakao, were not drowned: ‘For when theflood overtook them, they embarked in a wooden mortar, which chanced to be lyingin the yard of their house, and in that frail vessel they floated safely to theRagasan mountain.’42 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn42]So here, handed down since time immemorial by Taiwanese headhunters, we have theessence of the story of Noah’s Ark, which is also the story of Manu and thestory of Zisudra and (with astonishingly minor variations) the story of all thedeluge escapees and survivors in all the world.43[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn43] At some point a realinvestigation should be mounted into why it is that furious tribes ofarchaeologists, ethnologists and anthropologists continue to describe thesimilarities amongst these myths of earth-destroying floods as coincidental,rooted in exaggeration, etc., and thus irrelevant as historical testimony. Thisis contrary to reason when we know that over a period of roughly 10,000 yearsbetween 17,000 and 7000 years ago more than 25 million square kilometres of theearth’s surface were inundated. The flood epoch was a reality and in my opinion,since our ancestors went through it, it is not surprising that they told storiesand bequeathed to us their shared memories of it. As well as continuing tounveil it through sciences like inundation mapping and palaeo-climatology,therefore, I suggest that if we want to learn what the world was really likeduring the meltdown we should LISTEN TO THE MYTHS.If you do that you cannot fail to notice, across the 600 or so ancient floodmyths known to scholarship, that the events they describe, again and again, weretruly terrifying ones. Terrifying. And while we must accept, because thearchaeologists say so, that humanity 16,000 or 12,000 years ago was made upentirely of ‘primitive’ hunter-gatherers, the myths themselves often tell a verydifferent story – when they speak, for example, of the antediluvian cities ofthe Sumerians or of the Atlanteans before the Fall. If the myths are importantmemories repackaged as narratives that could be passed down from generation togeneration, then what are we to make of memories such as these?Along with growing numbers of people today I have the uneasy sense that sciencehas not fully understood the peoples of the flood epoch – and that some globalcultural development of great significance may have been underway at that timewhich was lost or severely dislocated in the inundations. Above all else it ishints and clues, first to the existence of this lost episode of culturaldevelopment and secondly to its character, that I have sought in thegeographical anomalies of ancient maps – which are not anomalies if they chartthe effects of changing sea-levels at the end of the Ice Age – and in my globalsearch for underwater monuments that were submerged at the same time. I proposethat the consistent patterns of map anomalies that we have documented – fromHy-Brasil to India to Japan – bear mute witness to an ancient science ofcartography and navigation that explored the world and charted it accuratelyover a period of several thousand years during the post-glacial meltdown.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_225_r1.jpg]The longitudinal distances, in degrees, from Giza to Tiruvannamalai, Angkor andpoint ‘D’ appear to be based on geometric and astronomical constants.Nor are the maps the only evidence of that conjectured lost geography. Anotherpoint that I have touched on from time to time is relevant here. This is theapparently planned construction all around the world of sacred, oftenmegalithic, sites on specific relative longitudes. I have commented in this bookon the intriguing longitudinal relationship that exists between the Pyramids ofGiza in Egypt, the great temple of Arunachela at Tiruvannamalai in south Indiaand the temples of Angkor in Cambodia (Arunachela is 48 degrees of longitudeeast of Giza; Angkor is 24 degrees of longitude east of Arunachela; 48 ÷ 2 = 24;48 + 24 = 72; 5 × 72 = the 360 degrees of a circle). As I have indicated, thesenumbers, and others in the same sequence, turn up repeatedly in ancient mythsfrom all parts of the world.44 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn44]The sequence bears a relationship, which may or may not be causal, to theastronomical phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes (whichproceeds, in round numbers, at the rate of 1 degree every 72 years).45[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn45] But all the numbers that composethe sequence in the myths also have something else in common – literally theirlowest common denominator. They are all divisible by 3.The number 90 = 30 × 3. In terms of the circle (of which it is exactly onequarter), of geometry (the right angle), and of navigation, there is no doubtthat 90 degrees is a significant figure. If point ‘A’ is 90 degrees of longitudeaway from point ‘D’ then the two longitudes (‘A’ and ‘D’) are, literally, aquarter of the earth apart from one another. And if there is a sacred site onpoint ‘A’ – the Pyramids of Giza -and a sacred site on point ‘D’ as well, thenyou would have to be really bad at mental arithmetic not to notice the peculiarlongitudal relationship, based on the lowest common denominator of 3, that seemsto link both of them to Tiruvannamalai and to Angkor within the same quadrant.Whether it is by accident, or it is the result of some ancient geodetic surveythat founded marker shrines on key longitudes that were later elaborated intomonuments, the following 3-based relationships do exist: Tiruvannamalai with itsSiva cult is 16 × 3 degrees (i.e., 48 degrees) east of Giza, Angkor is 24 × 3degrees (i.e., 72 degrees) east of Giza; point ‘D’ is 30 × 3 degrees (i.e., 90degrees) east of Giza. In addition, point ‘D’ is 6 × 3 (i.e., 18 degrees) eastof Angkor and 14 × 3 (i.e., 42 degrees) east of Tiruvannamalai.[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_226_r1.jpg]So what and where is this mysterious point ‘D’ so intricately linked by base-3geodesy to Angkor, Giza and Tiruvannamalai? It is a spectacular megalithic sitein central Taiwan, up in the mountains where the flood survivors went – up onthe Wuhe plateau of the central highlands. And not only is it 90 degrees east ofGiza. An additional bonus, as I was to discover when I checked its bearings onmy GPS, is that it lies almost exactly on the Tropic of Cancer, where at middayon the summer solstice a gnomon – or vertical upright – will cast no shadow.I didn’t even know point ‘D’ existed when we started our trip to Taiwan inAugust 2001 – but I had asked our local contacts there to introduce us to anyinteresting megaliths on the island. They took us to the Wuhe plateau, where byfar the most spectacular and truly monumental of Taiwan’s many megalithic sitesis to be found at Sao Pa, ringed by distant peaks and overlooking a river valleyof stunning, simple beauty.Although folklore has it that two other megaliths originally stood at Sao Pa,only two have come down to us today. Carved in one piece out of black slate,both are classic stele or menhirs, tall and narrow, the larger 7.4 metres inheight and the smaller just over 5 metres high. Both show a clean-cut horizontalgroove at ‘neck’ level which is indeed somewhat suggestive of a neck and givesthe menhirs a statue-like form. * In round numbers of degrees and minutes the present latitude of the Tropic of Cancer is 23 degrees 27 minutes north. The location of the Sao Pa menhirs is 23 degrees 28 minutes north. The difference between the two is therefore one minute – i.e., 1/60 of a single degree. * In round numbers the longitude of the Great Pyramid of Giza is 31 degrees 07 minutes east (i.e., east of the arbitrary and recent Greenwich Meridian); the longitude of the Sao Pa menhirs is 121 degrees 21 minutes east of Greenwich – the difference between the two is therefore 90 degrees, within 14/60 (i.e., less than a quarter) of a single degree.In summary, if we impose on a map of the earth a ‘world grid’ with Giza (notGreenwich) as its prime meridian, then hidden relationships become immediatelyapparent between sites that previously seemed to be on random, unrelatedlongitudes. On such a grid, as we’ve just seen, Tiruvannamalai stands onlongitude 48 degrees east, Angkor stands on longitude of 72 degrees east and SaoPa stands out like a sore thumb on longitude 90 degrees east – all numbers thatare significant in ancient myths, significant in astronomy (through the study ofprecession), and closely interrelated through the base-3 system.So the ‘outrageous hypothesis’ which is being proposed here is that the worldwas mapped repeatedly over a long period at the end of the Ice Age – tostandards of accuracy that would not again be achieved until the end of theeighteenth century. It is proposed that the same people who made the maps alsoestablished their grid materially, on the ground, by consecrating a physicalnetwork of sites around the world on longitudes that were significant to them.And it is proposed that this happened a very long time ago, before historybegan, but that later cultures put new monuments on top of the ancient siteswhich they continued to venerate as sacred, perhaps also inheriting some of theknowledge and religious ideas of the original navigators and builders.And the original navigators and builders themselves? What direct traces of theircivilization are to be found?This brings us back to the underwater quest – for the traces, anywhere andeverywhere around the world, of submerged structures that do not make sensewithin the current paradigm of prehistory. We’ve followed those traces from theIndian Ocean and the Persian Gulf, through the Mediterranean, into the Atlanticand now finally to the underworld of the East China and Yellow Seas that isbounded in the north by the Korean peninsula and Kyushu, in the east andsouth-east by the arc of the Ryukyu archipelago, and in the south by Taiwan.Having explored other anomalous submerged sites in the same region – Aguni,Kerama, Chatan, Yonaguni – I was intrigued, but not surprised, when I firstheard that a strange underwater structure had been found off Taiwan’s Pescadoresislands.DIVING AT TIGER WELLI will not repeat the inundation history of the Pescadores given in chapter 28[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c28_r1.htm#c28] or of the former island that lay totheir north near the spot marked by Ymana on the 1424 Antilia chart.Irrespective of the Ymana issue, however, it is obvious that the Pescadores intheir own right – located on the tip of a strategic peninsula of mainland China13,500 years ago, then later one island, then later still the 64 tiny remnantsthat are seen today – are a plausible location in which to search for underwaterruins from the flood epoch.They are plausible for another reason too. Ancient myths of the Pescadores speakof a great castle with huge ‘red’ walls that lies submerged somewhere amongstthe islands. It was precisely these myths that led a government official to askthe brilliant Taiwanese diver Steve Shieh to look for underwater ruins if hehappened to be working in the area. Over a period of several years, Stevecomplied, searching the waters around most of the islands. Eventually he wasrewarded with an extraordinary discovery off the island of Hu-ching (‘TigerWell’). This happened more than twenty years ago and has received no attentionor publicity in the West. Luckily for me, however, TBS, a large Japanese TVstation, ran a report on Steve and his discovery as recently as January 2001.The report was seen by several Japanese friends, who drew it to my attention.We did two days of diving with Steve Shieh off Hu-ching island at the end ofAugust 2001.The structure that he showed us consists of two immense walls, hundreds ofmetres in length, one running due north-south and the other running dueeast-west, crossing the north-south wall at right angles. At the east end of theeast-west wall is a large circular enclosure, part of which has completelycollapsed. The east-west wall is in relatively shallow water – 4 to 6 metresdepth. The north-south wall starts at 4 metres depth but can be followed down to36 metres depth. All the walls are a consistent height of 3 metres from the baseto the top of the wall; however, some sections are broken.In a volcanic, earthquake-prone area such as Taiwan one must be conscious of thepossibility that such walls could be natural features – specifically basalticdykes (quite common around the Pescadores). Such dykes form when a wall-likemass of igneous rock intrudes into cracks in older sedimentary rock.46[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c30-ftn46]Despite extremely strong currents flowing unpredictably from eight differentdirections (why are there always currents around underwater monuments?), I wasable to examine the walls quite thoroughly. My initial impression is that theyare not basaltic dykes. This is mainly so because, after scraping offmarine-growth from several sections of the walls, Steve showed me courses ofindividual blocks laid tightly together side-by-side. The joints between theblocks in some cases admit the point of a knife and it was possible for me towork the knife blade in as far as the hilt and move it entirely aroundindividual blocks. In addition the nice north-south and east-west orientation ofthe walls, though possible naturally, is a strong indicator that humans wereinvolved. Finally, there is that ancient local legend about a ‘castle’ thatvanished beneath the sea …[images/Hanc_9780307548566_epub_227_r1.jpg]But here, as everywhere else, more research – much more research – is needed tosettle the matter. Any such research should also investigate the submerged bankfurther north that may be all that remains of the antediluvian island of Ymanamarked on the 1424 chart.ONE AMONGST MANY UNDERWORLDSThey say that the Kingdom of the Sea God has a gateway that is guarded by ashark. So having never once seen a shark at the stone circles of Kerama I didtake it as a good omen when one appeared on my last dive there. It was a sleekreef white-tip, not too fearsome, since it was less than 2 metres long, and itpatrolled Centre Circle for several minutes, quite untroubled by our presence.That was at the beginning of September 2001, after Santha and I had completedthe dives in Taiwan and flown up to Okinawa to rendezvous again with IsamuTsukahara and his team. Shun Daichi, who had been with us in Taiwan, alsoaccompanied us to Kerama, and Kyoshi Nagaki joined us there as well.We had allowed four days minimum, and assumed we might need more, sinceSeptember is the typhoon season, but in the end Kerama gave me what I needed injust two dives on the first day.It gave me Komakino Iseki, 30 metres underwater – not just one but a series ofovals of huge diameter made up of hefty rounded river stones sprawled aroundCentre Circle on the ancient rocky outcrop at the bottom of the sea. I believethat the similarities evident in photos 73 and 74 speak for themselves, needingvery little commentary. Type and size of stone, the method of laying the stonesto form the great ovals, the shape of the ovals themselves, the construction ofbanks consisting of two or three courses of stones piled on top of one another,and the use of patterns of ‘chained’ interlinked ovals are all identical atKomakino Iseki and underwater at Kerama.In my view it is necessary for the site to be protected by the Japanesegovernment now, and for excavations to be conducted there as soon as possible bycompetent marine archaeologists to ascertain whether any pottery fragments andother typical artefacts of the Jomon period are present amongst the stones. Isuspect they will be.But the real mystery that archaeology needs to solve is the relationship betweenthe large-diameter ovals of river stones that are typical of other Jomonspiritual sites like Komakino Iseki – though at this depth they must be at least5000 years older than Komakino Iseki – and the very different and much moreambitious project represented by the weird semi-subterranean complex of CentreCircle and Small Centre Circle.Logic suggests that the Jomon must have made both the river-stone ovals and therock-hewn circles, and that if we look we are likely to find other such man-madesites underwater in the region which will further testify to this lostarchitectural episode in their prehistory.What else was lost then, in that epoch when we dropped the silver thread ofmemory that connected us to our own past?An underworld, I suspect, is truly about to be revealed.One of many."},{"pageContent":"POSTSCRIPT 1 / THE UNDERWORLD IN THE GULF OF CAMBAYIn chapter 14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14] I reported the claimeddiscovery by India’s National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) of anextensive urban complex underwater in India’s Gulf of Cambay. The discovery wasannounced on 19 May 2001 by Science and Technology Minister Murli Manohar Joshiwith the suggestion that the structures dated to the Harappan period of theIndus-Sarasvati civilization. I pointed out that inundation science firmlyindicates the Gulf of Cambay to have been submerged in pre-Harappan times andspecifically in quite a narrow time-window between 7700 years ago and 6900 yearsago. From this it follows, if the structures that have been identified areindeed man-made, that they must date from a rather early phase of thepre-Harappan period. Moreover, a date of submergence between 7700 and 6900 yearsago only tells us that the city was built at some time before then – not howlong before. Since the geometrical structures identified by the NIOT’s side-scansonar readings extend over more than 9 kilometres of the sea-bed, and since acity on that scale could not have grown up overnight, logic suggests that it islikely to be significantly more than 7700 years old. I wrote in chapter 14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14]: ‘A city 9 kilometres in extent andmore than 3000 years older than Harappa and Mohenjodaro would rewrite not onlythe history of the Indian subcontinent but of the world.’Archaeologists’ reactions to the NIOT’s claims were understandably muted and insome cases hostile; in consequence there was virtually no international mediacoverage of the discovery which, very rapidly, seemed to have been forgotten.Nevertheless, I made contact with the NIOT and provisionally arranged to divewith them in the Gulf of Cambay in November-December 2001 as part of the finalfilming trip for the television series of Underworld.When we arrived in India in November 2001, I talked with archaeologists at theNIO (National Institute of Oceanography – a completely separate operation fromthe NIOT) and they told me they did not accept that anything of significance hadbeen discovered. Most likely, they said, the geometrical ‘structures’ seen onthe side-scan sonar readings were merely artefacts of the imaging process.Likewise, R. S. Bisht, a director of the Archaeological Survey of India and aleading expert on the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, told me frankly that he didnot believe the NIOT’s findings and that they must be ‘hallucinations’.I was therefore not filled with optimism when I arrived in the port of Bhavnagaron the Gulf of Cambay to keep my previously made appointment with the NIOT – andmy sense of unease increased when I was informed that Indian Naval Intelligencehad refused to issue me a permit to dive on the alleged underwater site. Still,we set up the cameras for a day of filming on board the NIOT research vessel,the M.V. Sagar Paschmi, and waited to see what senior NIOT scientists had to sayabout the matter.The story that they told us on camera and the evidence that they presented to usbanished any reasonable doubts. Despite the ridicule and cold shoulders to whichthey had been subjected by the archaeological establishment, they had indeedmade a discovery of staggering significance. According to Dr S. Kathiroli, theNIOT’s Project Director, and geological consultant S. Badrinarayan, they hadbeen surprised by the hostile reactions of archaeologists to the initialannouncement of their findings in May 2001. As scientists, however, they haddecided to pursue the mystery further through empirical research and see whereit led. Thus, between May and late November 2001 they had conducted furtherside-scan sonar surveys and backed these up with sub-bottom profiling around thegeometrical structures.The results confirmed their initial impression that extensive man-made ruins didindeed lie on the sea-bed in the Gulf of Cambay at depths of between 25 and 40metres and at distances of up to 40 kilometres from the modern shoreline. Thesub-bottom profiles revealed extensive, well-built foundations to thegeometrical structures and in some cases walls rising as much as 3 metres abovethe sea-bed and extending down several metres below. Moreover, as well as theoriginal ‘city-complex’ covering a rectangular area roughly 9 kilometres longand 2 kilometres wide, a second city of similar size had been found a littlefurther to the south at similar depths. Both cities lie along the courses ofancient rivers that had flowed here when the area was above water, and in onecase the remains of an ancient dam more than 600 metres long have beenidentified.Thus far the NIOT had been unable to dive on the sites, due to the great tidalamplitude in the Gulf and extremely hazardous currents. Moreover, when they sentdown their remotely operated vehicle (ROV), its cameras were unable to recordclear images because of zero visibility due to dissolved solids in the waters ofthe Gulf. How therefore to get to the sort of ‘ground truth’ that might impresssceptical archaeologists? The only solution, the NIOT decided, was to liftsamples directly off the sea-bed from the heart of the areas identified in theirside-scans and sub-bottom profiles.The results, which they showed us and we were able to film, are spectacular. Injust one day of sampling using grabs and trawls more than 2000 man-madeartefacts were recovered – including jewellery, stone tools, pottery andfigurines. The assemblage, which is typically ‘pre-Harappan’ (and which includescarbon-datable human remains such as teeth), confirms that the underwaterstructures identified by the side-scans and sub-bottom profiles were indeedlarge-scale human settlements before their inundation. The extremely ancientcharacter of the artefacts also seems to rule out any possibility that theunderwater sites could date from a period later than the pre-Harappan. On therecord S. Badrinarayan told me that in his opinion these submergedcity-complexes must, at the very youngest, date to between 7000 and 8000 yearsago and that the most likely agent of their inundation was sea-level rise at theend of the Ice Age rather than any kind of fault collapse due to seismicactivity – for which the region is nevertheless renowned. Perhaps somecatastrophic combination of earthquake activity and sea-level rise could accountfor the massive and apparently very sudden scale of the submersion which, on theface of things, appears to have obliterated an entire civilization in thisregion.More work must be done to establish the dates exactly and to come to terms withthe true nature of the enigma of the Gulf of Cambay. Yet we know already, by thevery extent of the ruins, that they represent something that orthodox historiansand archaeologists have never accepted – the possibility that a lostcivilization lies concealed in Indian prehistory and that the Indian flood mythof Manu and the Seven Sages rests firmly on ground truth.STOP PRESSOn 16 January 2002 India’s Minister of Science and Technology released the firstresults of carbon-dating of the artefacts from the flooded cities of the Gulf ofCambay. The results date the artefacts to 9500 years ago – 5000 years older thanany city so far recognized by archaeologists."},{"pageContent":"POSTSCRIPT 2 / THE UNDERWORLD IN THE BAY OF BENGAL3 APRIL 2002, MAHABALIPURAM, TAMIL NADUSinking down through the murky waters of the Bay of Bengal a mile offshore ofthe south-east Indian town of Mahabalipuram, I found myself amongst hugesubmerged walls, plazas and pinnacles emerging out of the gloom – structuresthat seemed more like the work of gods or titans than of men and to belong morein the world of myth than that of history. With a kick of my fins I turnedslowly around, and in every direction that I looked I saw extensive andimpressive ruins stretching away. Involuntarily my heart began to pound and mybreathing speeded up. Because for more than five years I had been diving theworld’s oceans searching for evidence just such as this – the hard evidence thatI had long believed must lie behind mankind’s collective inheritance of morethan 600 ancient ‘flood myths’.Readers who have come this far will recall that I first visited Mahabalipuram in1956 when I was just six years old (my father was working as a surgeon at theChristian Medical College in the nearby town of Vellore). My next visit was on ajourney of personal reminiscence in 1992. It was then (see chapter 5[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05]) that I purchased an anthology oftravellers’ journals and reports edited by a certain Captain M. W. Carr in 1869under the title Descriptive and Historical Papers Relating to the Seven Pagodasof the Coromandel Coast. The ‘Seven Pagodas’ is the old mariners’ name forMahabalipuram, and on my third visit to the town in February 2000 (see chapter11 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11]) I took Captain Carr’s anthologywith me. In one paper J. Goldingham, Esq., writing in 1798, spoke of the part ofMahabalipuram that I remembered best from my childhood – the ‘Shore Temple’,carved out of solid granite, lashed by waves:The surf here breaks far out over, as the Brahmins inform you, the ruins of acity which was incredibly large and magnificent … A Brahmin, about 50 years ofage, a native of the place, whom I have had an opportunity of conversing withsince my arrival in Madras, informed me his grandfather had frequently mentionedhaving seen the gilt tops of five pagodas in the surf, no longer visible.An earlier traveller’s report, from 1784, describes the main feature ofMahabalipuram as a ‘rock, or rather hill of stone’, out of which many of themonuments are carved. This outcropping, he says:is one of the principal marks for mariners as they approach the coast and tothem the place is known by the name of ‘Seven Pagodas’, possibly because thesummits of the rock have presented them with that idea as they passed: but itmust be confessed that no aspect which the hill assumes seems at all toauthorise this notion; and there are circumstances that would lead one tosuspect that this name has arisen from some such number of Pagodas that formerlystood here and in time have been buried in the waves …The same author, William Chambers, then goes on to relate the more detailed oraltradition of Mahabalipuram – given to him by Brahmins of the town during visitsthat he made there in 1772 and 1776 – that prompted his suspicion of submergedstructures.According to this tradition a Raja named Malecheren ruled at Mahabalipuram atsome time in the remote past. He encountered a being from the heavenly realmswho became his friend and agreed ‘to carry him in disguise to see the court ofthe god Indra’ – a favour that had never before been granted to any mortal:The Raja returned from thence with new ideas of splendour and magnificence,which he immediately adopted in regulating his court and his retinue, and inbeautifying his seat of government. By this means Mahabalipuram became sooncelebrated beyond all the cities of the earth; and an account of itsmagnificence having been brought to the gods assembled at the court of Indra,their jealousy was so much excited at it that they sent orders to the God of theSea to let loose his billows and overflow a place which impiously pretended tovie in splendour with their celestial mansions. This command he obeyed, and thecity was at once overflowed by that furious element, nor has it ever since beenable to rear its head.GO WHERE THE FISH AREIt was this myth that now kept drawing me back to Mahabalipuram. Almost exactlya year later, in February 2001, I was there again – this time to interviewfishermen on camera for my Channel 4 TV series, Flooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age.My wife, Santha, whose mother-tongue is Tamil – the language of Mahabalipuram –was seated beside me on the beach on a pile of drying nets with a large,gossipy, excited and jocular crowd gathering round us. Everybody in the villagewho might have an opinion or information to contribute was there, including allthe fishermen – some of whom had been drinking palm toddy most of the afternoonand were in a boisterous and argumentative mood. What they were arguing aboutwas their answers to the questions that I was asking and precisely who had seenwhat, where underwater – so I was happy to listen to their animatedconversations and disagreements.An elder with wrinkled nut-brown eyes and grey hair bleached white by longexposure to the sun and sea spoke at length about a structure with columns whichhe had seen one day from his boat when the water had been exceptionally clear.‘There was a big fish,’ he told me. ‘A red fish. I watched it swimming towardssome rocks. Then I realized that they were not rocks but a temple. The fishdisappeared into the temple, then it appeared again, and I saw that it wasswimming in and out of a row of columns.’‘Are you certain it was a temple?’ I asked.‘Of course it was a temple,’ my informant replied. He pointed to the pyramidalgranite pagoda of the Shore Temple. ‘It looked like that.’Several of the younger men had the usual stories to tell about heroic scarydives – lasting minutes, hearts thudding, their breath bursting in their lungs-to free fishing gear snagged on dark and treacherous underwater buildings. Inone case, it seemed, a huge net had become so thoroughly entrapped on such astructure that the trawler that was towing it had been stopped in its tracks. Inthe case of another underwater ruin divers had seen a doorway leading into aninternal room but had been afraid to enter it.One strange report was that certain of the ruins close to Mahabalipuram emit‘clanging’ or ‘booming’ or musical sounds if the sea conditions are right: ‘Itis like the sound of a great sheet of metal being struck.’‘And what about further away?’ I asked. ‘If I were to take a boat south,following the coast, what would I find? Are the underwater structures mainlyjust here around Mahabalipuram or are they spread out?’‘As far south as Rameswaram you may find ruins underwater,’ said one of theelders. ‘I have fished there. I have seen them.’Others had not travelled so far, but all agreed that within their experiencethere were submerged structures everywhere along the coast: ‘If you just gowhere the fish are then you will find them.’EXPEDITIONThe next challenge for me was now somehow to set up a full-scale divingexpedition to Mahabalipuram. The responsible authority in India is the marinearchaeology division of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO). However, Iknew that the NIO, on its own, did not have sufficient funds or incentive to putan expedition in place.Fortuitously at about this time – the spring of 2001 – I was approached by JohnBlashford Snell of the Dorset-based Scientific Exploration Society (SES). Overlunch at my home in Devon, Blashford Snell asked me if any of the mysteriesraised by the research for my new book Underworld might make a worthwhile SESexpedition. Naturally I suggested a quest for Mahabalipuram’s supposedly‘mythical’ flooded city. I also recommended a second site, Poompuhur, which liesabout 200 kilometres south of Mahabalipuram. In chapter 14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14] I describe my dives there with the NIOin February 2001 to investigate a mysterious ‘U-shaped structure’ that their ownmarine archaeologists had found at a depth of 23 metres (about 70 feet). I feltthat it was worthy of much closer investigation and that a well-resourced divingexpedition to both Poompuhur and Mahabalipuram stood a chance of making someexciting discoveries.On Blashford Snell’s request I introduced the SES to the NIO and over thefollowing months nudged and cajoled the sometimes faltering communications ofthe two organizations until the plans for the expedition had been fullyapproved. Former Royal Marines officer Monty Halls, himself a diving instructor,was selected by the SES to lead the expedition, and twelve volunteer divers,mostly from Great Britain, put up all the necessary funding.Thus it was that in April 2002 I found myself once more in Mahabalipuram – thistime supported by all the divers and expertise needed to test my hypothesis thatthe local myths of a flooded city might actually lead us to a city underwater.Naturally I feared the failure of such a public quest, whilst hoping that itwould succeed. Yet even in my wildest dreams I could not have imagined howimmediately self-evident it would be, from the moment we got in the water, thatfollowing the clues in the myths and local traditions had indeed led to thediscovery of a major archaeological site …HOW OLD?But how old are the spectacular underwater ruins lying off the coast ofMahabalipuram likely to turn out to be?As I sank down through the murky waters on my first dive there and began tonotice the huge walls snaking across the seabed, I was struck – despite what thefishermen had told me – by the stark differences in architectural style betweenthese looming submerged structures and the temples of the historical period,such as the Shore Temple, that I knew on land. The material was the same – localred granite – but in general the block sizes of the underwater structures weremuch bigger. On later dives I was to discover that they included clusters oftruly enormous megaliths, weighing up to four tonnes each, that seemed to be theremains of colossal buildings torn apart by some powerful cataclysm – probablythe very cataclysm that had flooded this place. Each gigantic cluster proved tolie at the centre and highest point of a large rectangle of ruins and theserectangular areas were spaced out at quarter-mile intervals north and south,parallel to the shore.I made a couple of dives with Santha, who was shooting underwater stills, and acouple of dives with Trevor Jenkins, the expedition’s videographer. On one diveTrevor and I followed a superb, curved wall that ran unbroken for more than 16metres. On another I was able to expose the core masonry on a different lengthof wall, revealing the fine jointing between blocks.On the very last dive, at a site we’d tagged as ‘location 4’, Trevor discoveredwhat he thought might be a stone carving of a lion’s head in profile lying onthe seabed. I wasn’t so sure: it was too damaged and shrouded in marine growthfor me to be certain what it was or even if it was man-made at all. While Trevorfilmed it, I tried to clear a section of it with my knife, but all I couldestablish was that it was solid granite, about the radius and thickness of a carwheel, and roughly crescent-shaped. I couldn’t make out any individual features– but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there. It will have to be found again onsome future dive, removed from the sea and studied in the lab before any firmconclusions can be drawn about what it is.HASTY CONCLUSIONSThat at any rate would be normal archaeological procedure. So I was confusedafter our return from Mahabalipuram to learn that the NIO had issued a pressstatement proposing a possible date and function for the submerged ruins andciting this very same ‘lion figure’ as evidence:Based on what appears to be a Lion figure, of location 4, ruins are inferred tobe parts of temple complex. The possible date of the ruins may be 1500–1200years before present. Pallava dynasty, ruling the area during the period, hasconstructed many such rock-cut and structural temples in Mahabalipuram andKanchipuram.To come to such far-reaching deductions on the basis of ambiguous video footageof an alleged ‘lion figure’ strikes me as hasty, to say the least. None of theNIO archaeologists saw this ‘figure’ at first hand as Trevor and I did, and Ifor one am not convinced that it is any kind of figure at all. Moreover, the useof lion symbolism is widespread in India and indeed in global sculpture ofalmost all periods. Surely, therefore, a heavily overgrown and damaged objectlike this ought to be studied thoroughly before it and the submerged ruins allaround it can safely be assigned to a specific dynasty such as the Pallavas orto a specific chronology such as 1500 to 1200 years ago?Moreover, the Pallava temples on land at Mahabalipuram are reliably dated to1500 to 1200 years ago – precisely the same period suggested by the NIO for thesubmerged ruins that we now know lie a mile and more offshore. If both groups ofstructures do date from the same period, however, then the NIO must be able toexplain why one group is now submerged beneath the sea to depths of between 5and 7 metres (15 and 21 feet) whilst the other is still above water.An obvious explanation, and the one preferred by the NIO, is that there musthave been massive coastal erosion in this area, or that perhaps a stretch of thecoast just collapsed in some wild, unpredictable tectonic event – perhaps noteven tremendously long ago – that submerged the big Pallava constructions on oneside of the fault-line while leaving those on the other side intact and still ondry land.Another possibility, however – one not even considered by the NIO in itsstatement – is that the submerged group could be significantly older than thegroup on land. As we’ve seen throughout Underworld, sea-level rose more than 100metres at the end of the last Ice Age (between 17,000 years ago and about 5000years ago) and if it is sea-level rise alone that has submerged the megalithicstructures offshore of Mahabalipuram, then how old are they likely to be?BOMBSHELLOn our return from India on 6 April 2002 I e-mailed Dr Glenn Milne, theinternational expert on sea-level rise whose inundation maps have been usedthroughout Underworld, and told him what we’d found at Mahabalipuram. Perhaps heand other geologists at Durham University could help clarify how big a partsea-level rise had played in submergence of the ruins and suggest a date whenthey had last stood above water.Glenn’s reply, repeated a few days later on BBC Television’s national 6 o’clocknews, came as a bit of a bombshell:I had a chat with some of my colleagues here in the Dept. of Geological Sciencesand it is probably reasonable to assume that there has been very little verticaltectonic motion in this region during the past five thousand years or so.Therefore, the dominant process driving sea-level change will have been due tothe melting of the Late Pleistocene ice-sheets. Looking at predictions from acomputer model of this process suggests that the area where the structures existwould have been submerged around six thousand years ago. Of course, there issome uncertainty in the model predictions and so there is a flexibility ofroughly plus or minus one thousand years in this date.THE U-SHAPED STRUCTURE OF POOMPUHURPrevailing archaeological opinion recognizes no culture in India 6000 years agocapable of building anything much – let alone a series of vast megalithicstructures on the scale and extent that confronts us at Mahabalipuram. Nor doesthe mystery stop here. As we’ve seen, the fishermen at Mahabalipuram speak ofother ruins, even further out from shore in much deeper water, which remain tobe identified and explored. On my travels in the region (see chapter 11[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11]) I’ve also heard reports of mysteriousunderwater structures off Poompuhur, Rameswaram (overlooking the Palk Straitbetween India and Sri Lanka) and Kaniya Kumari (Cape Comorin) in the far southof the subcontinent. The reader will recall the pervasive Tamil flood mythlinking all these areas that speaks of a lost land called Kumari Kandam that wasswallowed up by the sea in three terrible deluges, the first of which took place11,500 years ago.In the early 1990s the NIO conducted a marine archaeological survey offPoompuhur for the state government of Tamil Nadu and discovered a very large andapparently man-made structure more than 5 kilometres from shore at a depth of 23metres (70 feet). The story of this discovery is told in chapter 1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01] of Underworld and followed up inchapter 14 [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14]. Its potential importancearises exclusively from the depth of submergence of the structure – whichsuggests, as the reader will recall, that it could have been underwater for11,000 years. If it is man-made, therefore, then the obvious implication is thatit must have been built more than 11,000 years ago when it still stood on dryland. And just as archaeologists know of no culture in south India more than6000 years ago that would have been capable of building the now-submergedstructures at Mahabalipuram, so also they know of none at Poompuhur (or anywhereelse in India, or in the world) that would have been capable of any project onthe scale of the U-shaped structure more than 11,000 years ago.The results of the SES/NIO expedition to Poompuhur in March 2002 wereinconclusive. Despite extensive dives over a period of ten days the team couldnot reach a unanimous verdict on the U-shaped structure. On two shows of hands aclear majority of the group, including one of the two NIO marine archaeologists,concluded that it is man-made. But there were significant exceptions to thisview and I therefore do not yet claim to have proved the case for thestructure’s artificiality that I set out in chapter 14[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14]. On my own dives with the team in March2002 I did, however, notice several features of the structure that had notpreviously caught my eye. Of these I believe the most interesting are (1)sections of what appears to be a second, lower wall, about 2 metres from themain wall and running parallel to it, that may once have completely surroundedthe structure; (2) the impression reported by several divers as well as myselfthat the main wall of the structure is octagonal or hexagonal in form (‘like theold threepenny bits’, commented Trevor Jenkins) rather than explicitly‘U-shaped’; (3) well-formed courses of blocks clearly visible beneath marinegrowth at several points on the structure; (4) evidence from visual examinationof a sample that the material of which these blocks are made is laterite – acommon construction stone in south India since times immemorial; (5) thepresence of large symmetrical slabs (approx 1.5 metres × 1.5 metres × 0.5metres) scattered on the seabed near a smaller mound 45 metres north-west of theU-shaped structure; (6) evidence from side-scan sonar readings of otheranomalous structures nearby, including one identified in March 2002 as astraight wall approximately 100 metres in length, lying in 25 metres of waterand almost 7 kilometres from land.I believe that the U-shaped structure has passed the crucial first test of closescrutiny over a lengthy period by a team of divers and marine archaeologists. Ithas not yet been decisively proved to be man-made but it has certainly not beenproved to be natural either. It remains an anomaly and an enigma. And as is thecase with the mysterious underwater ruins of Mahabalipuram, it cries out forfurther research …"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 1 / REPORT ON THE COMPLETION OF THE JOINT SES/NIO EXPEDITION TOSOUTH-EAST INDIAGRAHAM HANCOCK, 6 APRIL 2002Originally posted on ‘The Mysteries’ message board atwww.grahamhancock.com [http://www.grahamhancock.com]Hi folks,Santha and I flew back in from Tamil Nadu this morning.As regulars on this MB know, we have been diving at Poompuhur and atMahabalipuram in south-east India. We have had the privilege of working therewith ten first-rate divers from Britain led by Monty Halls of the ScientificExploration Society and with a great team from India’s National Institute ofOceanography led by Kamlesh Vora.At Poompuhur, despite intensive diving on the mysterious U-shaped structuresubmerged about 5 kilometres offshore at a depth of 23 metres (see chapters 1and 14 of Underworld), we could not reach a unanimous verdict. On two shows ofhands a clear majority of the group, including one of the two NIO marinearchaeologists, concluded that it is a man-made structure. But there weresignificant exceptions to this view and I therefore do not claim to have provedmy case there during this expedition.Over the coming week or so I will set out on this site, supported byphotography, the principal pieces of evidence that convince me and others thatthe structure is man-made. A great deal more work is going to have to be done onit and neighbouring structures, however, before the matter can be regarded ashaving been satisfactorily settled – one way or the other.The reason for this continuing uncertainty, despite the best efforts of a largegroup of determined and objective researchers, lies in the very bad divingconditions and poor visibility at Poompuhur, which hamper and restrict the workunderwater at all times.At Mahabalipuram, the other objective of the expedition, the situation is muchclearer. A press conference will be held on 10 April 2002 to announce theextraordinary underwater discoveries that our team made there last week up to 2kilometres from shore at depths of 5 to 7 metres. Relevant pages in Underworldwhere I describe my research in Mahabalipuram that led directly to thesediscoveries are 119–122 and 258–261.Of course, the real discoverers of this amazing and very extensive submergedsite are the local fishermen of Mahabalipuram. My role was simply to take whatthey had to say seriously and to take the town’s powerful and distinctive floodmyths seriously. Since no diving had ever been done to investigate theseneglected myths and sightings, I decided that a proper expedition had to bemounted. To this end, about a year ago, I brought together my friends at theScientific Exploration Society (SES) in Britain and the National Institute ofOceanography (NIO) in India and we embarked on the long process that has finallyculminated in the discovery of a major and hitherto completely unknown submergedarchaeological site.I’ll try to find out next week the date that Glenn Milne’s model suggests forthe submergence of the Mahabalipuram structures. Meanwhile, I want to state veryclearly and for the record that I am making no claims as to the age of thestructures, or what they are, or who built them, or why and when they wereinundated. All this will have to be established through further research – whichthe NIO estimates will take many years and will involve the participation ofexperts from many different disciplines. I do, however, feel fully vindicated inthe view that I have long held and expressed in my books and television seriesthat flood myths deserve to be taken seriously and can lead to the discovery ofsignificant underwater ruins.The information that we have gathered at Mahabalipuram up to now will bereleased at the SES press conference on 10 April."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 2 / SES PRESS RELEASE, 5 APRIL 2002, ANNOUNCING THE DISCOVERY OFUNDERWATER RUINS AT MAHABALIPURAM AND INVITING MEDIA TO A PRESS RECEPTION, 10APRIL 2002The Scientific Exploration Society is proud to announce a major discovery ofsubmerged ruins off the south-east coast of India and invite you to a PressReception at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday 10 April 2002, at the Nehru Centre, 8,South Audley Street, London WIK IHF.Following a theory first proposed by bestselling author and television presenterGraham Hancock, a joint expedition of 25 divers from the Scientific ExplorationSociety (SES) and India’s National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) led by MontyHalls and accompanied by Graham Hancock have indeed discovered an extensive areawith a series of structures that clearly show man-made attributes, at a depth of5–7 metres offshore of Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu.The scale of the submerged ruins, covering several square miles and at distancesof up to a mile from shore, ranks this as a major marine-archaeologicaldiscovery as spectacular as the ruined cities submerged off Alexandria in Egypt.This could prove the ancient myths of a huge city, so beautiful that the godsbecame jealous and sent a flood that swallowed it up entirely in a single day!Come and listen to Graham Hancock, Monty Halls and view unique pictures/ video.Further info www.india-atlantis.org [http://www.india-atlantis.org].Contacts: Melissa Dice; Tel: 01747 854898; email: base@ses-explore.org; SarahJane Lewis (Press) Tel: 01963 240468."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3 / PRELIMINARY UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS OFMAHABALIPURAM. STATEMENT BY NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY, 9 APRIL 2002A team of underwater archaeologists from National Institute of Oceanography NIOhave successfully ‘unearthed’ evidence of submerged structures off Mahabalipuramand established first-ever proof of the popular belief that the Shore temple ofMahabalipuram is the remnant of series of a total seven of such temples builtthat have been submerged in succession. The discovery was made during a jointunderwater exploration with Scientific Exploration Society, UK.The team of archaeologists from NIO, trained in diving, carried out underwaterexploration on April 1–4, 2002 and have successfully recorded evidence ofpresence of ruins underwater off Mahabalipuram. The salient features of thefindings are as follows: * Underwater investigations were carried out at 5 locations in the 5–8 m water depths, 500 to 700 m off Shore temple. * Investigations at each location have shown presence of the construction of stone masonry, remains of walls, a big square rock-cut remains, scattered square and rectangular stone blocks, big platform leading the steps to it amidst of the geological formations of the rocks that occur locally. * Most of the structures are badly damaged and scattered in a vast area, having biological growth of Barnacles, Mussels and other organisms. * The construction pattern and area, about 100 m × 50 m, appears to be same at each location. The actual area covered by ruins may extend well beyond the explored locations. * Based on what appears to be a Lion figure, of location 4, ruins are inferred to be parts of temple complex. * The possible date of the ruins may be 1500–1200 years BP. Pallava dynasty, ruling the area during the period, has constructed many such rock-cut and structural temples in Mahabalipuram and Kanchipuram.To place reasonable arguments on submergence of ruins, a full-scaleinvestigations are underway to record the role of sea-level fluctuations,coastal erosion and neo-tectonic activities in effecting shoreline changes inthe area in the recent past.The site has great potential to explore total lay-out plan of the structures andcauses of submergence."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 4 / COMMENTS BY GRAHAM HANCOCK ON THE NIO STATEMENT OF 9 APRIL 2002REGARDING PRELIMINARY UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS OFF MAHABALIPURAMI have only two comments to make on the NIO press release, but both of them aregrave.(1) Despite a friendship with the NIO stretching back over two years, I notethat the NIO statement makes no mention of my instrumental role in bringingabout these exciting discoveries off Mahabalipuram. I regret this oversight,since there can be no doubt that I have earned the right to recognition in thisdiscovery and that my input both in formulating the hypothesis of submergedruins at Mahabalipuram, in putting that hypothesis forcefully before the public,and in the conception and implementation of an expedition to test thathypothesis has been absolutely decisive.It is in black and white on pages 119–22 and pages 258–61 of my book Underworld(published by Penguin 7 February 2002), and in my Channel 4 Television SeriesFlooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age (broadcast 11, 18 and 25 February 2002) that Ihave long regarded Mahabalipuram, because of its flood myths and fishermen’ssightings, as a very likely place in which discoveries of underwater structurescould be made, and that I proposed that a diving expedition should be undertakenthere.It is also absolutely a matter of record that it was I who subsequently took theinitiative to bring together the Scientific Exploration Society (SES) and theNIO during 2001 so that the expedition could take place and that I expendedconsiderable efforts putting the two groups in touch and nudging along theirco-operation.I think you will find if you remove Graham Hancock from the equation thatanother twenty or many more years might have elapsed before the marinearchaeology division of the NIO would have dived at Mahabalipuram.If you remove Graham Hancock from the equation, the SES and the NIO would nothave been brought together and the SES would not even have been aware that therewas a mystery to investigate at Mahabalipuram.In other words if you remove Graham Hancock from the equation it is a plainfact, and nothing more nor less than the truth, that neither the NIO nor the SESwould have been diving at Mahabalipuram.The discoveries that we have made might have been made later, or never at all.Such questions are entirely hypothetical, however. The fact is that thediscovery has been made now and that my research, initiatives and efforts wereinstrumental in bringing it about. In any kind of moral or decent universe, inwhich credit is given where credit is due, I believe that I deserve somerecognition for this. I ask nothing more than that.(2) My second comment on the statement concerns the unwisdom and unfortunatedisregard of basic scientific procedure on the part of the NIO in speculatingabout a possible date of 1500 BP to 1200 BP for the submerged ruins. Thisspeculation seems largely to be based on what is claimed to be a sculpture of alion at location 4 – thought to be typical of the sculptural art of the Pallavadynasty. Unfortunately, however, neither of the two NIO marine archaeologistswho were diving with us actually saw the alleged ‘figure’. The only people whodid were myself and my dive-buddy Trevor Jenkins. It was Trevor who firstspotted it. We then examined it together and Trevor shot video footage of it.All other comments on this lion figure are second-hand, based on viewings ofTrevor’s video footage only.My own very much first-hand comment is that if the figure is indeed that of alion, this by no means confirms a connection with the Pallavas – since lionsculptures are typical of whole swathes of Indian art and symbolism and cannotbe regarded as a Pallava monopoly. More importantly, the so-called lion figureis by no means necessarily a lion figure at all. As noted above, I am one ofonly two divers who have seen it and handled it, and I suspect strongly that itis not a lion’s head and perhaps not even part of a statue. I had not voicedthat suspicion before now because I thought the scientific community believedthat weighty conclusions one way or another about possible archaeologicaldiscoveries should only be reached after much further research. But now I seethat, without doing any research at all, and without any marine archaeologistsever having examined the alleged ‘figure’, the NIO rushes in to suggest apossible date in its statement.In my view the NIO should have refrained from such unwise, premature speculationand simply left the issue of the dating of the site open for the vast amount offurther research that does indeed need to be done before anything can beconfirmed. As one who has often been accused of prematurely assigning olderdates to archaeological sites on the basis of too flimsy evidence, I find itironic that the NIO should assign a possible date of 1500–1200 BP to this sitewithout any evidence at all. The NIO is not even at this stage aware of thesea-level curve for this part of the south-east Indian coast – surely a crucialfactor in any attempt to date the site.Sincerely,Graham Hancock9 April 2002"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 5 / WHO DISCOVERED THE UNDERWATER RUINS AT MAHABALIPURAM? AND WHO ISCLAIMING WHAT?GRAHAM HANCOCK, 13 APRIL 2002Originally posted on ‘The Mysteries’ message hoard atwww.grahamhancock.com [http://www.grahamhancock.com](1) In another thread Martin Stower draws attention to the following commentary:Mohapatra, G. P., and M. H. Prasad (1999), ‘Shoreline changes and their impacton the archaeological structures at Mahabalipuram’. Gondwana GeologicalMagazine, vol. 4, pp. 225–33. Reading this paper, person finds that they hadproposed in print back in 1999 that underwater archaeological ruins lay offshoreof the coast of Mahabalipuram. In this case, Hancock is wrong in stating ‘Buthere in Mahabalipuram we have proved the myths right and the academics wrong.’In fact, he has proved the academics, in this case G. P. Mohapatra and M. H.Prasad, were correct in hypothesizing that the remains of ancient ruins layoffshore of coast of Mahabalipuram.(2) I was unaware of Mohapatra and Prasad’s work; had I known of it, I wouldcertainly have referred to it in Underworld. Apropos of this, during the recentSES/NIO expedition to Mahabalipuram, Kamlesh Vora informed the team that the NIOtoo had previously thought of diving there to check out the local floodtradition. This was back in the 1980s under the leadership of S. R. Rao(unfortunately now retired) – a man with a great interest in India’s floodmyths. (See my interview with Rao in chapter 1[Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01] of Underworld, where he makes specificreference to the myths of lost lands off the south of India and to the relevanceof these for marine archaeological research.) Apparently, however, the water wastoo ‘muddy’ when the NIO marine archaeologists arrived at Mahabalipuram and theydecided not to dive. The project was never taken up again.(3) There is no need for speculation about what exactly I’m claiming with regardto the Mahabalipuram underwater discoveries. My views are already on the recordon this Message Board. Here are the two definitive passages:6 April 2002Of course, the real discoverers of this amazing and very extensive submergedsite are the local fishermen of Mahabalipuram. My role was simply to take whatthey had to say seriously and to take the town’s powerful and distinctive floodmyths seriously.

Nor do I even claim to be ‘the’ theorist whofirst proposed the hypothesis that there might be ruins underwater offshoreMahabalipuram. As I report in Underworld, that ‘hypothesis’ has been around inscholarly circles since at least the eighteenth century. I and several othershave subsequently made input to the elaboration of this hypothesis and the NIOactually set out to test it in the 1980s, but in the end did not go diving.Thereafter, the question of whether or not there were ruins underwater offMahabalipuram lapsed into obscurity until Mohapatra’s and Prasad’s work on theone hand, and my own on the other. My path to understanding why the question wasworth asking is described in Underworld. What I claim is to have been the firstperson to have followed that path all the way through to its logical conclusionand to have been instrumental in the actual discovery of actual ruins – ruinsthat had been previously suspected but never proven to exist -underwater offMahabalipuram.From my post of 9 April 2002:It is in black and white on pages 199–22 and pages 258–61 of my book Underworld(published by Penguin 7 February 2002), and in my Channel 4 Television SeriesFlooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age (broadcast 11, 18 and 25 February 2002) that Ihave long regarded Mahabalipuram, because of its flood myths and fishermen’ssightings, as a very likely place in which discoveries of underwater structurescould be made, and that I proposed that a diving expedition should be undertakenthere.It is also absolutely a matter of record that it was I who subsequently took theinitiative to bring together the Scientific Exploration Society (SES) and theNIO during 2001 so that the expedition could take place and that I expendedconsiderable efforts putting the two groups in touch and nudging along theirco-operation.I think you will find if you remove Graham Hancock from the equation thatanother twenty or many more years might have elapsed before the marinearchaeology division of the NIO would have dived at Mahabalipuram.If you remove Graham Hancock from the equation, the SES and the NIO would nothave been brought together and the SES would not even have been aware that therewas a mystery to investigate at Mahabalipuram.In other words if you remove Graham Hancock from the equation it is a plainfact, and nothing more nor less than the truth, that neither the NIO or the SESwould have been diving at Mahabalipuram.The discoveries that we have made might have been made later, or never at all.Such questions are entirely hypothetical, however.

I have no idea whether the NIO is aware ofMohapatra’s and Prasad’s work, or whether the latter are aware of the work ofthe NIO. But when I come to update Underworld later this year I will certainlymake reference to it.Graham Hancock"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 6 / UK PRESS COVERAGE OF MAHABALIPURAM DISCOVERY, APRIL 2002DAILY TELEGRAPH, 11 APRIL 2002DIVERS FIND REMAINS OF SIX LOST TEMPLES’By David Derbyshire, Science CorrespondentA MYSTERIOUS settlement that sank beneath the waves at least 1,200 years ago hasbeen discovered by divers off the south-east coast of India.Granite blocks and walls that lie 20 ft below the surface may be the remains ofsix ‘lost temples’ that form part of local mythology.The ruins came to light after the controversial amateur archaeologist andbest-selling author Graham Hancock interviewed fishermen for a recent televisionseries.After hearing accounts of the myth of a submerged city, he and two dozen diverssearched the sea bed last week.India’s National Institute of Oceanography, which was involved in the discovery,believes the ruins at Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu could be 1,200 to 1,500 yearsold.But Mr Hancock, who argues that civilisation predates the ancient Egyptians andSumerians by thousands of years, believes the city could go back to 3000 BC.The ruins were discovered half a mile off the coast by a team from the NIO andthe UK-based Scientific Exploration Society. They include remains of walls andscattered carved blocks and stones and may cover several square miles.According to local legend Mahabalipuram was once home to a great city. The godsbecame so jealous of its beauty that they sent a flood to swamp the city. Sixtemples were submerged, leaving just one on the shore.GUARDIAN, 11 APRIL 2002DIVERS ‘DISCOVER’ ANCIENT TEMPLEJames Meek, science correspondentThursday April 11, 2002Indian and British scientists have brought back pictures from the seabed of whatthey say could be a vast temple complex off the coast of Tamil Nadu – the ruinsof a long-lost city, drowned beneath the waves.The granite ruins, if they are not natural formations, could be what remains ofsix legendary temples built 1,500 to 1,200 years ago, submerged as a result ofnatural subsidence.However, Graham Hancock, the best-selling author of controversial books aboutlost civilisations, said the ruins could be much older. If they were submergedby globally rising sea levels, their age would be around 5,000 years.The pictures are the result of a three day diving expedition by India’s NationalInstitute of Oceanography and the Dorset-based Scientific Exploration Society.Mr Hancock, who dived with the team, said yesterday that SES had carried out theexpedition at his suggestion.‘Our divers were presented with a series of structures that clearly showedman-made attributes,’ said Monty Halls of the SES, who led the expedition.‘This is plainly a discovery of international significance that demands furtherexploration and detailed investigation.’The site lies at depths of five to seven metres, 500 to 700 metres offMahabalipuram, the site of a temple on dry land that dates to the firstmillennium AD.Mr Hancock, who is not an archaeologist and has infuriated many experts with histheories, said that he had inferred the existence of six temples underwater bycollating the stories of local fishermen with a legend that referred toMahabalipuram as the Seven Pagodas.Mr Hancock admitted yesterday that the submerged ruins might not be old enoughto relate to the kind of post-ice age flooding that destroyed the supposedcivilisations of his books.But he said their discovery vindicated his approach of seeking the substance inlocal myths. ‘I have argued for years that the world’s flood myths deserve to betaken seriously – a view that most western academics reject. But here inMahabalipuram we have proved the myths right.’Mr Hancock said the site ran for about two kilometres, and contained ‘a largeconglomeration of large, clean-cut blocks in discrete areas. They seemed likeseveral large ceremonial buildings surrounded by a lot of smaller ones.’THE TIMES, 11 APRIL 2002DIVERS DISCOVER ‘LOST CITY’ OFF INDIABy Mark HendersonSUBMERGED ruins found off India’s coast could be those of a legendary city saidto have been swallowed by the sea, according to explorers who located theremains.They are the second set of possible man-made ruins found off the subcontinentthis year. Another ‘lost city’ was found off Gujarat in January, but that claimhas been disputed by archaeologists.The latest underwater stone structures were discovered last week by anAnglo-Indian team, diving a mile off the coast of Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu,southeast India. The geometrical patterns that look like a network of walls,roads and ramparts suggest they could have been part of the lost city ofMelecherem, which, according to myth, was inundated by jealous gods.Graham Hancock, an author who believes thousands of ancient civilizations weresubmerged at the end of the last Ice Age and who took part in last week’sexpedition by the Dorset-based Scientific Exploration Society and the IndianNational Institute of Oceanography, said the ruins had convinced him that themyth was founded in reality.DAILY MAIL ‘WEEKEND’ MAGAZINE, 27 APRIL 2002Fantastic tales of lost cities are usually dismissed as romantic myths, hutGraham Hancock claims that those very stories led him to a submerged site datingback at least 6000 years to the ice age – far older than any other city onearth. Has the amateur archaeologist really rewritten history! Andrew Wilsoninvestigates.A few seconds after diving beneath the ocean’s surface, Graham Hancock peeredthrough the underwater gloom and saw the distinct outline of an ancient wallrising up from the sands. Swimming closer to the mysterious structure, he tookout his diving knife and, in order to test whether this was a man-made buildingrather than a natural formation, ran his blade through the masonry joints.Stretching out across the ocean floor was an extensive network of walls whichran for at least a mile out into the Bay of Bengal – sunken ruins which stand asevidence of a lost civilization engulfed by the waves.For years, the hidden underwater city at Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu, southernIndia, had been confined to the realms of mythology. Fishermen spoke of thegilt-edged tops of temples lying beneath the sea, and whispered of the elaboratepyramidal pagodas submerged for thousands of years, but science had dismissedtheir claims as folklore. However, Hancock’s discovery earlier this month of alost civilization at Mahabalipuram, 30 miles south of Chennai (the formerMadras), which Hancock believes could date back at least 6000 years, could forceus to rewrite the history books.Hancock’s theory, that civilization began not with the Sumerians in Mesopotamiaabout 5000 years ago, but in a number of cities submerged by cataclysmic floodsbetween 17,000 and 7000 years ago – has been widely rubbished by academics. Yetresearch arising out of this new discovery suggests that the maverick writer’sviews could be rooted in fact. On returning from the dive, Hancock contacted aworld-renowned expert in ice age sea levels, who, with the help of a verysophisticated computer, confirmed that the site dated from approximately 6000years ago.‘If this figure proves correct – and, in truth, a lot more work needs to be done– then it changes everything,’ says Hancock. ‘We can no longer think of theso-called “Fertile Crescent” of Sumeria as the cradle of civilization. The ideathat cities first started to be built around 3500 BC also goes out of thewindow. What seems more likely from the large body of evidence I have compiledis that there were a number of cities built before this time which weresubmerged by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age. Mahabalipuram, Isuspect, is one of them.’Hancock’s detective work begins with a detailed study of an area’s flood myths,tales he believes grew up because of a very real phenomenon – the 400-feet risein global sea levels after the melting of the ice caps. After researching aparticular flood myth, Hancock then studies maps to show how the region wouldhave looked at the end of the ice age. If the sea level data matches detailspassed down through an oral tradition, he believes there’s a good chance ahidden city could be lying just below the waves.Hancock first outlined his theories in his 1995 book Fingerprints of the Gods.The title may have established him as a literary Indiana Jones (the book sold astaggering 4.5 million copies), but it incurred the wrath of scholars andacademics, who attacked him for what they saw as his selective presentation ofevidence, lack of integrity and vulgar sensationalism. ‘Scientists asked me totry to substantiate my theories – to find actual sites to support my beliefs –and that’s what I’ve been doing over the past few years, touring the world insearch of the lost underwater cities. South India is a black hole in terms ofarchaeological research, as there doesn’t appear to be any trace of humanactivity between 12,000 and 3000 years ago. But what if the centres of anancient civilization had once been located along its old coastline, land whichwas subsequently submerged by flood water?’His connection with Mahabalipuram stretches back to his childhood when, as afive-year-old boy, he learnt to swim in its sparkling blue water. Born inEdinburgh in 1950, he arrived in India in July 1954 with his parents – hisfather had been appointed as a surgeon at the Christian Medical College andHospital in Vellore. ‘Imprinted on my memory for years afterwards – until Ireturned there in fact and was able to overlay old memories with new ones – wereimages of the eerie rock-hewn temples of Mahabalipuram, overlooking the Bay ofBengal and dating back 1200–1500 years.’ In 1992 he travelled to India on asentimental journey – his family had returned to Britain in 1958 and he wantedto revisit some of the places of his childhood.During that visit he bought a musty old book, an anthology of traveller’sjournals, from a shop in Madras, a volume which would later form the first cluein his underwater detective story. Although he didn’t read the book until twoyears ago, its contents forced him to reassess everything he knew aboutMahabalipuram. He learnt for the first time of the ‘Seven Pagodas’ story – thesix temples submerged beneath the sea, with the seventh still standing on theshore.‘A Brahmin about 50 years of age, a native of the place … informed me hisgrandfather had frequently mentioned having seen the gilt tops of pagodas in thesurf, no longer visible,’ wrote one traveller in 1798. According to myth, theancient ruler of the kingdom constructed a city of such magnificence atMahabalipuram that the gods grew jealous and orchestrated a tremendous flood toswallow it in a single day. The God of the Sea was ordered to ‘let loose hisbillows and overflow a place which impiously pretended to view in splendour withtheir celestial mansions,’ wrote the traveller. ‘This command he obeyed, and thecity was at once overflowed by that furious element, nor has it ever since beenable to rear its head.’In 2000 while researching his new book Underworld (Michael Joseph, £20), Hancockvisited Mahabalipuram once more, where he interviewed a number of localfishermen. Many described having seen underwater ‘temples’, ‘palaces’ and‘walls’ – even ‘roads’ – while diving to free trapped nets or anchors. Otherstalked of hidden doorways and rooms beneath the ocean which emitted strangemusical sounds. ‘If you just go where the fish are,’ one said, ‘then you willfind them.’ Yet the underwater investigator had to wait a further two yearsbefore travelling out to Mahabalipuram in an expedition organized in conjunctionwith the Dorset-based Scientific Exploration Society and India’s NationalInstitute of Oceanography. On April 3, half a mile from the shore, Hancockplunged into the blue waters of the Bay of Bengal – and what he saw lyingbeneath him almost took his breath away.‘What was staggering was that the ruins lay directly beneath the boat,’ he says.‘I swam down to a depth of about 20 ft and reached out to scrape the sand awayfrom the stone. It was clear from the masonry joints that the structure wasunmistakably man-made, rather than a natural formation. I could see straight andcurving walls, all made from clearly defined blocks of stone, and I followed onewhich was still completely intact for 50 ft. The site contains a conglomerationof large, distinct blocks which seem like several big ceremonial buildingssurrounded by a number of smaller ones. My initial reaction was, notsurprisingly, one of excitement. This was a man-made site which was new toarchaeology, a place where no one had ever dived before. It felt like divinginto a lost world.’Accompanying Hancock on the dive was Monty Halls, a former major in the RoyalMarines who led the expedition for the Scientific Exploration Society. Duringthe 17 years he has been diving, Halls, 35, a freelance expedition leader, sayshe has never seen anything like the majestic underwater structures ofMahabalipuram. ‘These enormous granite blocks looked like huge sugar cubes,about 20 ft tall, and there was a cluster of small stones around them,’ he said.‘Although it’s hard to say with any certainty, what we are seeing could havebeen a granite shrine surrounded by the remains of four temples.’Central to the significance of the discovery is the age of the structures.Although mainstream archaeology believes them to date from 1200 years ago -thesame time the rock-hewn sculptures and temples on the shore were carved fromgranite – Hancock believes the underwater ruins to be in the region of 6000years old. If the flooded city did indeed date from only 1200 years ago, to thetime of the Pallava dynasty, one would expect to find evidence of inscription onthe stone. Yet during the 49 separate dives done over the course of three daysby the team, not one inscription was found. In addition, the two structuresdiffer widely in their architectural styles. The shore sculptures are ornate andhighly decorative, while the underwater city is made up of simple, austere,rectangular blocks.The greatest single piece of evidence so far to date the lost ruins ofMahabalipuram as 6000 years old comes from geophysicist Dr Glenn Milne at DurhamUniversity’s world-renowned Department of Geological Sciences. Milne has builtup a large database of figures and a sophisticated computer programme that canprint out images of any shoreline at any period in history. When Hancock relayeddata from Mahabalipuram, Milne was able to tell him that the site was at least6000 years old. ‘Assuming there was no tectonic movement at the site, and itlooks like there wasn’t, then it appears that the area was flooded by a rise insea levels about 6000 years ago,’ says Milne. ‘The computer programme isaccurate to within 1000 years either side of the allotted date.’When Hancock heard this, he felt vindicated. ‘It proved that the methods I wasusing – the combination of deciphering ancient myths and new technology –actually worked,’ he says. ‘Of course, I am still keeping an open mind, but itdoes suggest I’m on the right track after all. It’s mainstream archaeology andscience that are blinkered.’However, this is not the first time Hancock’s theories have been bolstered bythe application of hard science. In January, it was revealed that the carbondating of artefacts discovered at two submerged sites in the Gulf of Cambay, offthe north-western state of Gujarat, show that these underwater cities are likelyto date from 9500 years ago – 5000 years older than any city recognized bymainstream archaeologists. The cities – which are 15 miles apart and lie 12 ftbeneath the waves – were discovered in May of last year, during routinepollution testing by India’s National Institute of Ocean Technology.‘Since then, of course, archaeology has done everything it possibly can todispute the evidence,’ says Hancock. ‘Experts have claimed that the samplescould have been contaminated by sea water, and that the wood tested could havesat on the seabed for thousands of years before the cities were built.Scientists will do anything they possibly can to rubbish my name. I’m a threatto them because I’m an amateur – however, I’m an amateur who is able topinpoint, with remarkable accuracy, a series of lost underwater cities whichcould force us to rethink everything we have ever learned about the origins ofcivilization.’In the next couple of months, Hancock predicts an announcement from Cuba whichwill reveal the discovery of an ancient man-made city 2200 ft under the ocean.He is also confident that more lost civilizations will be found off the coastsof Malta, Japan, China, Florida, the Bahamas and Central America. ‘After all,when the ice caps flooded ten million square miles of land were submerged,’ hesays. ‘Discoveries such as Mahabalipuram are just the beginning – during thenext 20 to 30 years I’m sure we will have uncovered dozens of underwater cities.It’s not so much the quest for one Atlantis, but the search for many, manyunderworlds.’"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 7 / PRESS REPORT ON PAULINA ZELITSKY’S EXPLORATION IN CUBAEXPLORERS TO RETURN TO OCEAN FLOORBy Anita Show, The Associated PressSunday May 19, 2002, 5.10 p.m.HAVANA (AP) – Floating aboard the Spanish trawler she chartered to explore theCuban coast for shipwrecks, Paulina Zelitsky pores over yellowed tomes filledwith sketches and tales of lost cities – just like the one she believes she hasfound deep off the coast of western Cuba.Zelitsky’s eyes grow wide as she runs her small hand over water-stained drawingsof Olmec temples in a dog-eared 1928 study of Mexican archaeology. The RussianCanadian explorer compares the shapes with green-tinted sonar images captured inMarch while studying the megalithic structures she discovered two years ago offCuba’s Guanahabibes Peninsula.Amid piles of sonar-enhanced maps is a well-worn copy of Comentahos Reales delas Incas, or Royal Commentaries of the Incas, a classic of Spanish Renaissancenarrative by the son of an Inca princess and a Spanish conquistador. Zelitsky isparticularly fascinated by Garcilaso Inca de la Vega’s account of ancient ruinsat the bottom of Lake Titicaca, Peru.‘You would not think that a reasonable woman of my age would fall for an idealike this,’ chuckled Zelitsky, a 57-year-old offshore engineer who runs theexploration firm Advanced Digital Communications of British Columbia, Canada.Zelitsky passionately believes the megalithic structures her crew discovered2310 feet below the ocean’s surface could prove that a civilization livedthousands of years ago on an island or stretch of land joining the archipelagoof Cuba with Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, about 120 miles away.The unusual shapes first appeared on the firm’s sophisticated side-scan sonarequipment in the summer of 2000, during shipwreck surveys off Cuba’s westerncoast, where hundreds of vessels are believed to have sunk over the centuries.The company is among five foreign firms working with Fidel Castro’s governmentto explore the island’s coast for shipwrecks of historical and commercialinterest. But the mysterious shapes have become the focus of this crew’sexploratory efforts.Puzzled by the shapes with clean lines, the team has repeatedly returned to thesite – most recently in March – for more sonar readings, more videotapes of themegaliths with an unmanned submarine. The crew left in mid-May for a month.Evidence for Zelitsky’s hypothesis is far from conclusive, and has been met withskepticism from scientists from other countries who nevertheless decline tocomment publicly on the project until scientific findings have been madeavailable. Submerged urban ruins have never been found at so great a depth.Elsewhere in the Caribbean, the ruins of Jamaica’s Port Royal are located atdepths ranging from a few inches to 40 feet below the ocean surface. The onceraucous seaside community was controlled by English buccaneers before it slidunder the waves in earthquakes beginning in 1692.Located at just 20 feet at the mysterious megalithic structures discovered inthe 1960s and 1970s in the sound between the Bahamas islands of North and SouthBimini. Scientific expeditions there have produced inconclusive results aboutthe shapes’ origins.Back in Cuba, a leading scientist recently admitted there is no easy explanationfor the megalithic shapes found by Zelitsky’s crew. The shapes on the sonar mapslook like walls, rectangles, pyramids – rather like a town viewed from thewindow of an airplane flying overhead.‘We are left with the very questions that prompted this expedition,’ geologistManuel A. Iturralde Vincent, research director of Cuba’s National Museum ofNatural History wrote March 13. At the time he was visiting the area aboard the270-foot long Ulises, the Spanish trawler Zelitsky outfitted with sophisticatedcomputer and satellite equipment for her surveys.In his written comments, later delivered at a scholarly conference here,Iturralde concluded it was possible the structures were once at sea level, asZelitsky theorizes.Because of the large faults and an underwater volcano nearby, Zelitsky supposesthe structures sank because of a dramatic volcanic or seismological eventthousands of years ago.Providing some support for that argument, Iturralde confirmed indications of‘significantly strong seismic activity’.Zelitsky shies from using the term ‘Atlantis’, but comparisons are inevitable tothe legendary sunken civilization that Plato described in his Dialogues around360 BC.There have been untold, unsuccessful attempts over the ages to find that lostkingdom. One common theory is that Atlantis was located on the Aegean island ofThera, which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption nearly 3600 years ago.Zelitsky does, however, mention known archaeological monuments when discussingher find.Numerous photographs are scattered throughout a video show of the megaliths,showing well-known ancient sites: the 1st century fortress of Masada high abovethe Dead Sea, Britain’s circular monument of Stonehenge, the Roman fortress ofBabylon in Cairo, the walls of Chan Chan, Peru, whose inhabitants were conqueredby the Incas.Perhaps, Zelitsky mused, the megaliths off Cuba are remains of a trading post,or a city built by colonizers from Mesoamerica. Those civilizations were farmore advanced than the hunters and gatherers the Spaniards found upon arrivinghere five centuries ago.Zelitsky admitted much more investigation is needed to solve the mystery.But that doesn’t keep her from believing, or from smiling slyly as she opens heragenda for 2002 to the first page.Written there are the words Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei uttered under hisbreath at the height of the Inquisition, right after abjuring his belief thatthe Earth revolved around the sun.‘E pur si muove,’ it reads – ‘Nevertheless, it does move.’"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 8 / PRESS REPORT FROM TIMES OF INDIA, 6 JULY 2002Submerged structures found off the coast of Mahabalipuram in the Bay of Bengalcould well solve the mystery of seven pagodas dating back to the Pallava Period(7th century AD)By Akshaya Mukul, Times of India, Times News Network, New Delhi, 6 July 2002The Archaeological Survey of India’s Underworld Archaeology Wing (UAW) hasdiscovered three walls and a number of carved architectural members of ancienttemples running north to south and east to west. Also found are seven bigsubmerged rocks 500 metres offshore.According to UAW in-charge Alok Tripathi, who undertook the diving 500 metreseast and north of the Shore temple in November 2001 and March this year, ‘thewalls are made of thick slabs of granite. Two long stone slabs, each with twoverticle slits to receive two other stone slabs, were kept upright. Several suchblocks arranged in a row formed a wall.’The technique of construction, he says, is so effective that these structuresare still in place despite violent seas and high-energy surf.‘The remnants are well carved and look like mouldings and pillars of temple.They are similar to the carvings in the existing temples of Mahabalipuram,’ hesays. Tripathi is hopeful of discovering more structures near the Shore temple.The ASI is planning to undertake diving towards the south of the temple.‘We are planning to dive during the Tamil month of Tai which falls betweenDecember and January. We will trace the extension of submerged structures andclean them to reconfirm our conclusion about their nature and purpose,’ he says.Part of the local legend, the story of submerged offshore temples, was firstrecorded by William Chambers, a British traveller, in the Asiatic ResearchJournal in 1788. He quoted older people having seen the ‘tops of several pagodasfar out in sea’, covered with copper. By the time Chambers visited the place‘the effect was no longer the same as the copper had been incrusted with mouldand verdigris’.What lends credence to the UAW’s excavation is a search carried out by divers ofUK-based Scientific Exploration Society and Indian National Institute ofOceanography in April. They claimed to have found ruins spread over severalsquare kilometres off the coast. During the expedition, divers came acrossstructures believed to be man-made."},{"pageContent":"ONLINE APPENDICES AND PHOTOGRAPHSA number of appendices prepared for this book, which could not be included inthe printed edition for reasons of space, are available online at my website:http://www.grahamhancock.com [http://www.grahamhancock.com].

ML units are on the Local Magnitude scale, which is thebasis for establishing an earthquake’s level on the famous Richter scale. MLmeasures the amplitude of a wave as it appears on a seismograph that has beenset up in a particular location, so it is essentially a measure of the extent towhich a certain bit of ground moves vertically in an earthquake. The Richterscale is logarithmic, so the magnitude goes up exponentially (by a factor of 10)with each step up the scale. An earthquake measuring 6.0ML has 10 times greatermagnitude than an earthquake measuring 5.0ML, and 100 times greater magnitudethan one measuring 4.0ML. NB, the units of the Richter Scale are M rather thanML, because the magnitude we’re dealing with is no longer local but should bethe same everywhere.53.

He found plentiful evidence that certain large gastropod seashells(Turbinella pyrum and Chicoreus ramosus) had been cleanly and efficiently slicedup to make jewellery. These shells are exceptionally hard and he came to theconclusion (page 96) that they must have been cut ‘with a specialized bronze saw… By studying the depth of each saw stroke on fragments of shell from theancient workshops, we can reconstruct the basic shape of the saw. It had a verythin serrated edge that was long and curved, similar to the saws still used inshell bangle making in modern Bengal. Even more astounding is the fact that theIndus bronze saw was able to cut the shell as efficiently as the modem steelsaws, which suggests that the Indus bronze workers were able to produce a bronzethat was as hard as steel.’13.

I was ignored. Thedeer reading of 0.17 per cent was taken as representative of the Cervus Layersuch that even 0.39 per cent would have seemed later; whereas in fact deer andeven hippo samples had yielded levels as high as 0.4 – showing that 0.17 is nota representative Cervus threshold. Moreover, the highly anomalous uranium oxidereading of 13 ppm for Ma.2 was ignored. Humphrey is ready to argue that eventhis result is ambiguous. But it is very difficult to see how so much uraniumoxide could have filtered over just a few thousand years into a tooth that wouldhave contained 0.1 ppm when its owner lived – especially since we now know thatGhar Dalam is an environment with low levels of uranium oxide in the percolatingwater82.

Using inundation maps of this area, French scientist JacquesCollina-Girard of the University of the Mediterranean in Aix-en-Provence noticedan island (geologists call it Spartel) near the western end of the straitmeasuring 14 kilometres long by 5 kilometres wide that existed from the LastGlacial Maximum until it was flooded by rising sea-levels around 11,000 yearsago. Despite its small size, and largely on account of its relationship to theStraits of Gibraltar mentioned by Plato, Collina-Girard had proposed thispalaeo-island as a candidate for Atlantis. See NewScientist.com, ‘Sea levelstudy reveals Atlantis candidate’, by Jon Copley, 18 September 2001. Note thatthere have been persistent reports by divers of significant unidentifiedunderwater ruins off the coasts of Spain and Morocco. One long-running story,reported in the US in the Orange County Register in 1973, concerns an expeditionby Maxine Asher of Pepperdine University to discover the ruins of Atlantis at asite about 20 kilometres off Cadiz in southern Spain. Before Spanish policestopped the expedition Asher’s team did claim to have discovered ‘pre-Roman andpre-Phoenician’ underwater ancient ruins at the site (see Orange CountyRegister, 27 March 1973, 17 July 1973, 22 July 1973, 26 July 1973, 22 August1973). Presumably the problems with the Spanish police have ceased, becausefurther expeditions have been mounted as recently as 2000 and Maxine Asher,reportedly, remains very much on the case. Good luck to her.37. [Hanc_9780307548566_epub_c23_r1.htm#c23-ftn37a] For details of the discoverysee J.
