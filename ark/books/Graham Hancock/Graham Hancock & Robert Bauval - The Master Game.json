It began in 1992 andwas finally brought to a close in 2011. The time-span reflects not only thecomplex nature of the subject matter but also the strong and enduring workingrelationship and friendship that I have with my co-author, Graham Hancock, amaster of the trade par excellence. It also highlights, yet again, the power ofteamwork and the old but true axiom that ‘two heads are better than one.’I would like to thank the many colleagues and friends who, through the manyyears, have helped me directly or indirectly with this book. My foremost thanksgo to my wife, Michele, who always gave me unflinching support. It is not easyto live with someone whose mind is often engrossed in solving historicalpuzzles. I also would like to pay special tribute to Mary Bruck of Edinburgh whosadly passed away recently. She was a very dear friend and she will be sorelymissed. Much thanks also go to my friends all over the world, not least HodaHakim (Cairo), Chafik and Racha Kotry (Alexandria), John and Josette Orphanidis(Athens), Gouda Fayed (Giza, Nazlet El Salman), Javier and Eva Sierra (Malaga),Adriano Forgione (Rome), Sandro Mainardi (Florence), Linda and Max Bauval(Hawaii), Christopher and Caroline Knight (UK), Alan Butler (UK), JulianoFernadez (Uruguay), Jean-Paul and Valentina Tarud-Kuborn (Chile), Jeanne Ribeiro(Brazil), Ryan Gilmore (Canada), Gary Evans (UK), Hillary Raimo (USA) and Sherifel Sebai (Cairo). My gratitude to my literary agent and friend Bill Hamilton ofA. M. Heath & Co. Ltd., who is always there to encourage and advise me, and tolisten to my over-enthusiastic oratory. The same gratitude also goes to myeditor and friend Gary Baddeley of The Disinformation Company in New York forhis patience, dedication, support and invaluable help. Much appreciation toRalph Bernardo for his diligence and dedication in putting this book together.As always I give thanks to all my readers, old and new, and hope that they willfind The Master Game as enjoyable as it was for me to co-write. Robert BauvalMalaga, Spain Thank you to my wife Santha and to our six children Sean, Shanti, Ravi, Leila,Luke and Gabrielle, who have given me so much solidarity, love and support overthe 19 years this book has been in the making. I’m really grateful to my Dad,too, who read the whole manuscript during what turned out to be his last summerand took the trouble to give me many helpful comments and suggestions. Hepassionately disagreed with many of my views on the Christian Church, but weagreed equally passionately that life has a spiritual meaning and that it doesnot end with the grave.

All that matters isthat it has been and continues to be believed. Such beliefs, built around aconcept of antagonistic forces – Darkness and Light, Good and Evil – battlingfor the human soul are bound to have been acted upon by those who held themstrongly.In this book we will explore a number of mysterious ancient documents, prominentamongst them the so-called Hermetic Texts, written down in Latin and Greek inthe early centuries of the Christian era. In one of these texts the god Hermes(the Greek counterpart of the ancient Egyptian wisdom god Thoth) delivers aprophecy to his pupil Asclepius:Do you know, Asclepius, that Egypt is an image of heaven, or to speak moreexactly, in Egypt all the operations of the powers which rule and work in heavenare present in the Earth below? In fact it should be said that the whole Kosmosdwells in this our land as in a sanctuary. And yet, since it is fitting that wise men should have knowledge of all eventsbefore they come to pass, you must not be left in ignorance of what I will nowtell you. There will come a time when it will have been in vain that Egyptians havehonored the Godhead with heartfelt piety and service; and all our holy worshipwill be fruitless and ineffectual. The gods will return from earth to heaven; Egypt will be forsaken, and the landwhich was once the home of religion will be left desolate, bereft of thepresence of its deities. O Egypt, Egypt, of thy religion nothing will remain but an empty tale, whichthine own children in time to come will not believe; nothing will be left butgraven words, and only the stones will tell of thy piety. And in that day men will be weary of life, and they will cease to think theuniverse worthy of reverent wonder and worship … Darkness will be preferred tolight, and death will be thought more profitable than life; no one will raisehis eyes to heaven; the pious will be deemed insane, the impious wise; themadman will be thought a brave man, and the wicked will be esteemed as good. As for the soul, and the belief that it is immortal by nature, or may hope toattain to immortality, as I have taught you – all this they will mock, and evenpersuade themselves that it is false. No word of reverence or piety, no utterance worthy of heaven, will be heard orbelieved. And so the gods will depart from mankind, – a grievous thing! – and only evilangels will remain, who will mingle with men, and drive the poor wretches intoall manner of reckless crime, into wars, and robberies, and frauds, and allthings hostile to the nature of the soul.1[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1]Against the onset of such dark times – and there have been many dark episodes inthe past two millennia – we demonstrate in this book that certain groups andindividuals have always stood prepared to act. These daring and valiant peopleknew from the outset that their resistance might put them in extreme danger andwould require much sacrifice, even the willingness to die. They also knew thattheir task might take a very long time, spanning several generations, centuries,perhaps even millennia. But it was the only game really worth playing for uponthe outcome depended nothing less than the spiritual redemption of mankind.Today covertly directed from Washington, DC, the ‘Master Game’ as we have cometo see it has evolved into nothing less than a grandiose scheme played on theworld stage to bring about a ‘new world order’. Let us be very clear from theoutset, however, that this book is neither a ‘conspiracy theory’ nor acompilation of such theories. Our objective is solely to make sense ofhistorical events, particularly events of recent times, that have rocked thevery soul of humanity.Yet the Master Game was not easy to recognize and comprehend, not least becauseit drew inspiration from a distant golden age set in far away places. This waswhen groups of carefully selected men and women, neophytes and adepts, werecarefully initiated into a high gnosis to equip them with great intellectualpowers that would enable them to guide and direct society along the path ofvirtuosity and enlightenment. This is why it will be necessary for the reader tojourney with us to the very source of the ‘Game’ and unhurriedly be usheredthrough the secret routes and alleyways that infiltrate great social andreligious reforms, the birth of the state of Israel, and finally the hideousepisode of 9/11 and the ongoing military and political mayhem that it set inmotion.As investigative writers with one foot in the Western world and the other in theArab world, and also as historians opting to dig deep under the veneer ofestablished history, we have become increasingly and disturbingly aware that theMaster Game has taken a rather strange twist over the last sixty years or so.Indeed it is our conclusion that it has now lost sight entirely of its originalobjective and, far worse, could be leading mankind towards an Armageddon ofbiblical proportions. To put it bluntly, there is a very dangerous and extremelystrong social and political undercurrent in one part of the world that isbuilding up largely unnoticed, and that is about to blow, like an overheatedgiant pressure cooker, into a gruesome clash of civilizations.For hundreds of millions of Muslims (and even in some Christian and Jewishcommunities) there is a weird perception that a Masonic-Zionist-American plot,hatched back in the early 1900s (but not implemented until the 1940s), has beendevised to take over and control the Arab world from Washington, London and TelAviv. This perception on the one side, whether based on facts or falsehoods, isperilously misunderstood on the other side by the Western world as a whole. Ourfindings show that the Master Game is not only being played by a set of newplayers having very different rules of engagement but also using very differentgame-boards. In simple terms, the Master Game has stopped being a battle betweenoppressed and oppressors, between the forces of evil and the forces of good, andhas transmuted itself into a dangerous collision of two cultures who see thefuture of the world in very different ways.From the time of the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century, the Master Gamebegan to change from direct physical confrontation with the powers that be (ofthe kind that took place during the Cathar ‘experiment’ – see Part I: The SecretFaith) to something much more subtle and insidious – a form of symbolic warfarethat would assail the establishment secretly and stealthily from within. Thisnew approach would not use conventional weaponry, or military forces, but rathera special gnosis known only an elect few. Like camouflaged commandos operatingunder the cover of darkness these elite, initiated insiders would place powerful‘intellectual time-bombs’ in the very heart of their unsuspecting oppressors,set to detonate at propitious moments. Continuing through the Enlightenment ofthe 17th century, the great social upheavals of the French and AmericanRevolutions of the late 18th century and finally down to our own times, it isnot an accident that top architects, town planners, and even sculptors andartists have been busily changing the urban landscapes of major cities –principally in Rome, London, Paris and Washington, DC – by strategicallylocating monuments and buildings that seemingly evoke ‘Masonic’ ideologies andsymbolism. Their objective or, more aptly, that of the Masters has been to erodeand finally eliminate the iron-hold of the Church and the monarchies and toestablish a new world order based on seemingly ‘Masonic’ ideals.We have made it our task to understand whence these ideas originated and also toattempt to define the true purpose of these strange urban developments. To thisend we have found it necessary not only to undertake a sort of ‘intellectualarchaeology’ of history but also to self-initiate ourselves into an ancient andvery potent way of thinking which, for want of better terms, we have dubbedtalismanic thinking.In our many years of research into ancient cultures and, more specifically,their powerful symbolic art and architecture, it has slowly dawned on us thatthe true language of humans is not, as we previously thought, the spoken wordbut the ‘silent language’ of symbols and signs that ‘speak’ directly to the mindand the soul of a person. And although everyone knows that a symbol is an imageor an object that represents something, few are aware that some symbols can beconverted into extremely powerful intellectual instruments that can havedevastating effects on large huge numbers of people by charging them withintoxicating ideologies and stirring emotions. When a symbol, whether a tangibleobject, monument or building, or whether an intangible idea or logo is thuscharged, then it becomes a talisman. Think of the Christian Cross, the Star ofDavid, the Islamic Crescent or the Nazi Swastika and the disturbing effects suchtalismans have had throughout history and you will begin to get the gist of thiselusive Master Game.To have a full understanding of how talismans work, and knowledge of exactlywhere, how and when to apply them for maximum effect, is to be in possession ofa potent arsenal of intellectual weaponry that can be used to change, reform,transform or, as the case may be, overthrow entrenched social and culturalsystems … and also replace them with new ones. Kingdoms, empires, wholecivilizations have been brought down with such intellectual weaponry, and theamazing thing is that in the most successful assaults not a single shot wasfired or a single bomb exploded; furthermore the intellectual war was foughtwith one side entirely oblivious of where the attacks came from and unable toassess the damage inflicted until it was too late.In 2009 the American novelist Dan Brown published his latest thriller, The LostSymbol, which purported to unmask the true ‘Masonic’ mission and the meaning ofthe strange city layout of Washington, DC. Although the plot was largelyfictional, the historical and urban settings he used were rooted in reality. Theinitial result of such wide popularization in semifictional blockbusters is thatseveral millions of people are now aware of a possible covert mission to turnthe capital of the United States into a Masonic ‘experiment’ using talismanicsymbolism in the layout of streets and positioning of stately buildings andmonuments. Another, more pertinent result, is that some residents of Washington,DC have become preoccupied by the real possibility that they live, eat, work andplay inside a giant ‘Masonic temple’ that is their city. Yet neither Dan Brownnor anyone else as far as we know has been able to explain exactly why such astrange city plan was created in the first place nor, too, what ultimatefunction such a scheme might truly serve.But as we emphasized earlier, to get to grips with this conundrum one must goback to the very roots of the ideologies that fired such a scheme and track itsevolution and transmission across the ages. It is an intellectual journey thatis truly worth the effort because at its end of the voyage, as happened with us,a veil will be lifted to reveal a strange world that was always there and yet isinvisible to the uninitiated eye."},{"pageContent":"PROLOGUE:THE SACRED CITIESThe boat of Isis, a feast which was celebrated in Rome with great pomp, wasknown as Navigium Isidis; after it had been launched in the water, it wasbrought back to the Temple of Isis and prayers were made for the prosperity ofthe emperor, for the empire and for the Roman people …François Noël, Dictionnaire de la fable No one ignores that Paris was originally enclosed in the island [the Îlede la Cité].

Less than an hour later the fate of Francehung in the balance and European history seemed set on a new and alarminglyunpredictable course.Contemporary engravings of the Bastille show a forbidding rectangular structureflanked by eight tall towers. It does not look easy to storm. Built in the late14th century as a fortress to protect eastern Paris, it was converted in the17th century into a squalid and ghastly prison for dissidents. By the time ofthe Revolution it was firmly established in the public mind as an instrument oftyranny and as a powerful symbol of the despotism of the French crown.The day after the storming of the Bastille an enterprising local contractor,Monsieur Pierre-François Palloy,1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en2]took it upon himself to mobilise a workforce of 800 citizens to dismantle thehated prison stone by stone.2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en3] Thework was so well done that within a month most of the structure had been reducedto rubble with only a small part of the perimeter wall and foundations stillintact.At this point something curious occurred. The suggestion was made, and for awhile taken seriously, that the stones of the Bastille should be salvaged inorder to construct a replica of an ancient Egyptian pyramid on the site.3[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en4] And although the project laterstalled for lack of funds, the core idea of making a symbolic connection withancient Egypt persisted behind the scenes. If a pyramid could not be managedsomething less would have to suffice. Thus it was that on 10 August 1793 a groupof revolutionaries ceremoniously installed a large statue of the ancientEgyptian goddess Isis where the Bastille had formerly stood. Depicting thegoddess seated on a throne flanked by two lions, the statue had been conceivedby Jacques-Louis David, the famous artist and propagandist of the revolution. Itwas to be one of the props in a macabre republican feast hastily put together inorder to celebrate the decapitation of King Louis XVI six months previously andthe forthcoming guillotining of Queen Marie-Antoinette still two months ahead.The sculptors, François Marie Suzanne and Pierre Cartelier, did not havesufficient time to cast the statue in the preferred medium of bronze so theysimply moulded it in plaster and coloured it with bronze paint.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en5] From the bare nipples of the‘goddess Isis’ could be seen water being ejected into an open basin below thestatue. Known as the ‘Fountain of Regeneration’, the general idea was for thecrowd of people to pass in procession in front of ‘Isis’ and drink ‘from herfertile breasts the pure and salutary liquor of regeneration’.5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en6]DE-CHRISTIANISATIONEveryone knows that philosophical ideas, notably those of Jean-Jacques Rousseauand Voltaire, were part of the ferment that led to the French Revolution. Stillit is hard to explain why an overtly religious ritual – such as the Isisceremony described above – should have received official sponsorship from therevolutionary government as early as 1793. That it did so, moreover, on a siteso powerfully symbolic as the Place de la Bastille, raises an interestingquestion. Is it possible that spiritual and even ‘religious’ beliefs could haveplayed a greater role than has hitherto been recognised in precipitating andsustaining the changes that gripped France after 1789.For example, although the matter has been little studied, it became clear in theearly days of the Revolution that its core objectives included not only theeradication of the monarchy and a radical readjustment of the social andeconomic order, as might be expected, but also another, even more far-reachinggoal: the eradication, no less – one might almost say the extirpation – ofChristianity from the soil of France. This objective was adopted as officialpolicy in the winter of 1793, a few months after the Isis rituals at theBastille, and set in train an intense and systematic national campaign of‘de-Christianisation’.6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en7] As Frenchhistorian Michel Vovelle sums up, this now almost forgotten facet of theRevolution was not some passive and progressive attempt at conversion, but amethodical and forceful enterprise imposed though violence and intimidation.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en8]Why this sudden rush to stamp out Christianity?Was it just that the Revolutionaries saw Christianity as a rival for the loyaltyof the masses and hated and resented the ancient ties between the monarchy andthe Church?Or was there another, deeper game being played?VERY CHRISTIAN KINGS BEHEADED BY THE CULT OF THE SUPREME BEINGThe kings of France liked to trace their origins back to the Merovingians, aFrankish dynasty of the fifth to the eighth centuries AD. Nothing is known aboutMerovech, the semi-legendary founder of the dynasty, but his son Childeric I isa historical figure who ruled a tribe of Salian Franks from his capital atTournai circa AD 470. In AD 481 or 482 Childeric was succeeded by his son ClovisI who united almost of all of Gaul and converted to Christianity around AD 496.Clovis died circa AD 511, but the Merovingian dynasty continued to rule much ofwhat is now France until AD 750. It was succeeded by the Carolingian dynastywhich gained great renown circa AD 800 with the dramatic coronation by Pope LeoIII of Charlemagne as the very first ‘Holy Roman emperor’. Thereafter all kingsof France were regarded as the protectors of the Roman Church and to this effectbore the title Roi Très Chrétien – ‘Very Christian King’. Indeed so pious wereFrance's medieval kings that one of them was actually canonised as a saint –Louis IX, a hero of the Crusades, who we will meet in Part I.8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en9]Meanwhile to return to that terrible year of 1793 – 4 – the year, in fact, ofthe revolutionary ‘Terror’ with its unruly orgy of beheading – a different kindof religious phenomenon was suddenly widely observed in France: Catholic priestsbegan to ‘abdicate’ their positions in droves9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en10] and a new, officially-sponsoredcult was launched by the Convention (the Revolutionary government) withinrecently ‘de-Christianised’ churches and cathedrals all across the land.Sometimes referred to as the ‘Cult of Reason’ but more commonly as the ‘Cult ofthe Supreme Being’, it seems that this new religion was the brainchild of therevolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre and that its establishment wasmasterminded once again by the artist Jacques-Louis David (who had previouslybeen involved in the Isis/Bastille stunt).THE TRICOLOR GODDESS WITH THE PHRYGIAN CAPIn street festivals staged during the French Revolution, the ‘goddess Reason’was routinely personified by an actress garbed with a tricolor red, white andblue veil and wearing the so-called Phrygian cap. This same little red cap wasin great vogue with the general public in the early part of the Revolution andwas worn especially by the sans-culottes (‘without culottes’), the most zealousfaction who partook in the thousands of guillotine executions in Paris andthroughout the country.The Phrygian cap is the typical headwear of two well-known pagan deities: thegoddess Cybele and the god Mithras.Cybele was the one of the great mother goddesses of antiquity and, moreparticularly at one stage of Roman history, whose ‘republic’ the Frenchrevolutionaries tried to emulate. As the name of her cap suggests, her cultorigins were in ancient Phrygia (modern Turkey). In statuary she was routinelyassociated with two lions, either depicted harnessed to her chariot or flankingthe ceremonial throne used by the high-priests of her cult. Medieval andRenaissance scholars frequently identified her with the ancient Egyptian goddessIsis. It therefore seems unlikely to be an accident that a Cybele-like goddesswas to figure so prominently in the iconography of the French Revolution – forexample in the so-called Génie de La République, a marble sculpture by theartist Joseph Chinard, made in the aftermath of the fall of the Bastille, whichshows ‘République’ as a young woman in Graeco-Roman garb wearing the Phrygianhat.10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en11]In the strange and terrible year of 1793 – 4 the so-called Cult of Reason spreadlike wildfire in the French provinces alongside the de-Christianisation process.It became common to witness large processions, or street theatres, in which the‘goddess Reason’ wearing the Phrygian cap was towed on a cart to the nearestchurch or cathedral. Such events might look like nothing more than excuses formen and women to get drunk together, yet in France there were always moreserious undertones. On 7 November 1793 for example no less a figure than thebishop of Paris, was forced by the Convention to recant his faith. Three dayslater, on 10 November, huge celebrations were organised at his cathedral inhonour of the alternative Cult of Reason.As the highlight of the celebrations a certain Mlle Aubry, a beautiful andpopular actress wrapped in a white veil and blue tunic and wearing the redPhrygian cap, emerged from a ‘temple’ dedicated to ‘philosophy’ and was sat on athrone while the crowds came to pay homage to her. The procession then marchedto the Convention, where Citizen Chabot, a zealous revolutionary and one of theco-architects of the new cult, decreed that henceforth the Cathedral of NotreDame in Paris, the oldest and most revered Christian sanctuary in the land, wasto become the ‘Temple of Reason’. Several ceremonies then followed where therole of the ‘goddess’ was assumed by various Parisian beauties, among them MlleMaillard, Mlle Lacombe and Mme Momoro.11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en12]THE OBELISK AND THE PAINTINGIn 1813, twenty-six years after the storming of the Bastille, the greatculture-changing momentum of the French Revolution seemingly came to a grindinghalt with the defeat of Napoleon. Seizing the moment, the exiled Count ofProvence, Louis-Stanislas-Xavier, elder brother of Louis XVI, promised theFrench people that he would uphold some of the tenets of the Revolution in a newform of monarchy. Then, advised by the brilliant statesman Talleyrand, heentered Paris in May 1814 where he was received with open arms by the war-wearyFrench and, amid much jubilation, was installed on the throne as Louis XVIII.12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en13]Louis XVIII ruled for ten years. He was a Freemason – on his death in 1824 hewas succeeded by his brother, the Count of Artois – also a Freemason – who tookthe name Charles X. Both monarchs showed a marked preference for ancientEgyptian symbolism in their public works and two projects of Charles X are ofparticular interest in this regard. The first involved transporting an intactancient Egyptian obelisk to Paris. The second called for the commissioning of agigantic painting in the Louvre.THE OBELISKIn 1827, Jean-François Champollion (dubbed the ‘father of modern Egyptology’ forhis breakthrough decipherment of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs) was commissionedby Charles X to arrange for the importation to Paris of a 3,500-year-old obelisk– one of a pair – that stood at Alexandria in Egypt.13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en14]The obelisk was destined for the Place de la Concorde, a prestigious location ofgreat personal significance to Charles X. It had originally being named inhonour of his father, Louis XV, an equestrian statue of whom had once graced it.But the statue had been pulled down and destroyed during the 1789 Revolution andthe site renamed by the Convention as ‘Place de la Concorde’. Here also theguillotine had been erected that had beheaded Louis XVI in January 1793 andMarie-Antoinette in October of the same bloodstained year. May we speculate thatthe installation of the obelisk was to commemorate the idea of a reborn andrestored monarchy, with the ancient solar symbol of the divine kings of Egyptrising in the heart of the Parisian skyline like a ‘phoenix’?THE PAINTINGCharles X’s second noteworthy project was to commission the artistFrançois-Édouard Picot to decorate the ceiling of his personal museum at theLouvre with a specific ‘Egyptian’ theme.Picot, like many promising artists of the time, had studied under the master,Jacques-Louis David – the man responsible for the statue of Isis in the Place dela Bastille. We should not be surprised, therefore, that the very same ‘Isis’ isfound on Picot's painting for Charles X.Still decorating a ceiling of the Louvre, the great work was completed in 1827and measures roughly 5 x 4 meters. Its title is L’Etude et le Génie dévoilent àAthènes l’Antique Egypte (‘Learning and Genius Unveil Ancient Egypt to Athens’).The figure of Isis dominates the scene and is depicted seated on a throneflanked by two lions – as was the case with David's earlier Isis of theBastille. The viewer, however, is immediately drawn to contemplate the sky abovethe goddess, where can be seen flying two angels in the act of ‘unveiling’ thesecrets of Isis.We catch a tantalising glimpse of a haunting landscape containing in the fardistance an obelisk and a group of pyramids at which Isis languidly casts hergaze. From the clouds next to the angels, the Greek goddess Athena appears withan owl at her feet symbolising initiation and wisdom. To the left of Athena is awinged-goddess wearing a laurel wreath symbolising ‘Learning’ (l’Etude). To theright of Athena is the so-called Génie de Paris, a naked winged youthbrandishing a torch in order to illuminate and reveal to Athena the Egyptianisedlandscape below.After the abdication of Charles X in 1830, Louis-Philippe I became the new rulerof France. Also known as the ‘Citizen King’, he commissioned a monument tocommemorate the Trois Glorieuses, those three days of 26, 27 and 28 July 1830that marked France's Second Revolution. This monument, which was completed in1836, is a tall pillar erected in the Place de la Bastille on the very spotwhere David had positioned his statue of Isis in August 1793. On top of thepillar is a close replica of the winged youth with the torch seen in Picot'spainting in the Louvre.Is Picot reminding us that here, below the winged Génie de Paris, had once beena statue of Isis as also seen in his painting?COINCIDENCE, OR BLUEPRINT?Let us imagine ourselves in Paris today, riding in a helicopter above theBastille pillar and looking westward, along the line of sight of the Génie deParis. We are hovering over the city's oldest and most sacred quarters. Sprawledbeneath us are some of the most impressive buildings and monuments that Parishas to offer. To our left runs the Boulevard Henri IV leading to the RiverSeine. The river itself runs roughly from east to west, and thus parallel to ourwestward line of sight, while beyond Boulevard Henri IV is the old Pont Sullyarching over the eastern edge of the Île St. Louis with its famous abbey of thesame name. The western tip of the island is linked by a pedestrian bridge to themuch larger Île de la Cité, site of the celebrated Cathedral of Notre Dame andthe impressive Palais de Justice.Across the Seine is the tall bell tower of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés –the latter, as we shall later see, intriguingly once a sanctuary dedicated tothe goddess Isis. Yet all these wonders will pale when we focus our eyes alongour line of sight westwards with the Génie de Paris, for before us will unfoldthe most enchanting urban landscape that Europe has to offer. Shooting straightlike an arrow is the Rue de Rivoli leading to the Church of Saint-Germainl’Auxerrois – the oldest in Paris, where the ancient kings of France weretraditionally baptised. Immediately beyond the church is the crab-shaped GrandLouvre, perhaps Europe's most wonderful museum and, until 1663, the main palaceof the kings of France.And there is yet more to feast our eyes upon. Today an imposing glass Pyramid –commissioned by President Mitterrand for the bicentennial celebration of 1989 –looms like a giant diamond in the central courtyard of the Louvre. Thisout-of-place pyramid seems to define for us an open vista westward leadingthrough Napoleon's Arc du Carrousel and towards the impeccably-groomed TuileriesGarden. Our line of sight further takes in the wide and perfectly straightAvenue des Champs-Élysées, the backbone of Paris that was once known as the Axehistorique – the ‘Historical Axis’. At this point it is impossible not to seethe tall Egyptian obelisk that rears up towards the sky in the Place de laConcorde at the entrance of the Champs-Élysées. And nor can we ignore the way inwhich the whole layout that we observe from the high vantage point of the Géniede Paris bears an uncanny and striking similarity to the layout and generalscheme suggested in Picot's painting. For if we examine this painting moreclosely and try to imagine ourselves now alongside the other winged Génie deParis which hovers over the mysterious Egyptianised landscape of Picot'smasterpiece, something immediately becomes clear. The obelisk and the variouspyramids that Picot included not only seem to define the central axis of thepainting but, if transposed to the layout of Paris, will correlate with theConcorde Obelisk and the Louvre Pyramid that define the central or ‘Historical’Axis of the city!Charles X’s decision to send Champollion to Egypt to bring back the obelisk wastaken during the year 1826 – 7 while Picot was in the process of painting hismasterpiece at the Louvre. We also know that Picot was deeply involved in thefurbishing of Charles X’s Egyptian museum at the Louvre Palace and that he wouldalmost certainly have been privy to the discussions surrounding the importationand positioning of the obelisk. Even though it was not until 1836 that it wasfinally raised up in the Place de la Concorde, therefore, its easy to understandwhy the artist might have been inspired to put an obelisk in his 1827 painting –and in the right place.Much harder to explain is the relationship between the pyramids Picot shows inthe painting and the Louvre Pyramid visible in our aerial view. This is becausethe latter is a modern work, less than 20 years old at time of writing, designedby architect I. M. Pei and completed in 1984.So the question is, how could Picot have anticipated I. M. Pei's pyramid? Or –more conspiratorially – did the 1827 painting allude to some sort of occult planor blueprint for Paris that has continued to be implemented over more than 150years? Or is it just a huge coincidence that the Egyptianised landscape beingunveiled in the painting has been reproduced in the architecture of Paris?WAS FREEMASONRY BEHIND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION?We have already seen how during the 1789 Revolution it was proposed to raise apyramid at the site of the Bastille – something that Picot would certainly haveknown of. Picot is also likely to have been aware of a number of other grandiose‘pyramid’ projects that were planned before and after the Revolution but thathad been stalled because of shortage of funds.There had been, for example, a massive ‘pyramid tomb’ planned in Paris in honourof the scientist Sir Isaac Newton who was a hero of the Enlightenment and,consequently, of revolutionary ideals. The ‘pyramid’ was designed by the Frencharchitect, Joseph-Jean-Pascal Gay, in 1800, and was to have had a greatperimeter wall with four gates modelled on the Temple of Karnak in Upper Egypt,and an alley of 18 sphinxes leading to the ‘pyramid’.14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en15]There were too, the various pyramids proposed by the architect Étienne-LouisBoullée. One of his surviving sketches is of a group of pyramids closelyresembling the pyramids in Picot's painting – where they are seen enveloped inclouds and haze with their capstones missing.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en16] The historian Jean Starobinski inhis study of the emblems and symbols of the 1789 Revolution, explains that the‘language of the Revolution’ was intensely ‘symbolic’. Starobinski also speaksof a mood that seems to have seized architects in the immediatelypre-revolutionary period: a novel need to use basic geometrical shapes – cubes,spheres, pyramids – on a monumental scale and to transform Paris into some sortof ‘utopian city’:… [there was a] need to add images to ideas, and to design the plans of an idealcity. This city, like all other utopic cities, would be governed by the laws ofa simple and strict geometry … All these grand architectural styles in line withsimple principles of geometry presented as projects remained unrealised. [Andalthough] a harmonious city, a city for a new age … existed in the portfolios ofcertain architects, well-before the storming of the Bastille … the Revolutionwould have neither the time, nor the resources, nor perhaps the audacity to askthem to undertake these great civic projects …16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en17]But why an Egyptianised utopian vision for Paris? Why pyramids andpseudo-Egyptian landscapes? Where did such strange ideas come from? And who waspromoting them?Such obsessions with symbolism, architecture and particularly geometry onceagain suggest the influence of Freemasonry. Yet the authorities are divided onthe matter. Scores of historians argue that an important role was indeed playedby Freemasons in the French Revolution while, on the other hand, equal numbersargue that Freemasonry had nothing or little to do with it. This state ofaffairs is adequately expressed by the French historian Jacques Godechot, anexpert on the subject:There is a whole genre of literature, with shows no sign of abating, whichattributes the responsibility of the Revolution, and especially the days of1789, to the Duc d’Orléans [the first Grand Master of the Grand Orient, thesupreme body which regulates Freemasonry in France]. According to thisliterature, it was the Duc d’Orléans who was responsible for the riots of theRéveillon, those of the 14th July, those of the night of the 4th August, andthose of the days of October. The Duc certainly attempted to profit from theseevents but whether he was the cause of them seems highly doubtful. In any case,if he did play this game, his efforts constituted a small influence compared tothe much larger forces that pushed the people, France and even all of theWestern world towards Revolution …17[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en18]The truth is that no historian, however thorough his or her research, can reallyknow what ‘forces’, visible or occult, moved the French people to erupt in totalrevolution against the monarchy and the Church in 1789. By definition such‘forces’ are impossible to gauge and sometimes may not be ‘visible’ or‘documented’ at all. It is a similar problem attempting to catalogue the forcesbehind the Crusades in the Middle Ages or behind the Holocaust in Nazi Germany –or indeed those ‘forces’ that launched the United States on its ‘War on Terror’at the beginning of the 21st century. No single force, occult or otherwise, canbe deemed solely responsible for any of these events; rather a combination offorces has in every instance been at play.In the case of the French Revolution, it is clear that one of the main forceswas generated by the terrible oppression of the people and the abuse of power bythe monarchy. Yet no historian will deny that there was also a strongphilosophical and/or intellectual undercurrent to the Revolution which exerted apowerful influence on the behaviour of key figures such as MaximillienRobespierre, Jean-Paul Marat and George Jacques Danton, as well as others suchas the painter Jacques-Louis David and the sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon. At thisstage of our investigation Freemasonry remains as good a candidate as any forthe source of this undercurrent.Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in America, another ‘sister’ Revolution had takenplace a decade earlier. There, too, a strong philosophical/ intellectualundercurrent can easily be detected which moved the main players such asBenjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine and George Washington. Andthere, too, a utopian city was, quite literally, in the making – to an esotericplan far less veiled than that of Paris.FRANKLIN, FREEMASONRY AND REVOLUTIONThat the American Revolution or War of Independence was much influenced byFreemasons and Masonic ideologies and principles is a wellaccepted thesis. Thereare several good works on this topic18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en19] that leave little doubt thatFreemasonry was one of the driving forces behind the ideals and tenets, and theattachment to republicanism, of the American Revolution. What is less well knownis the fact that there was a very close connection between the French andAmerican Masonic lodges at that time.It is not clear whether or not Freemasonry might have entered North Americabefore the establishment of the Grand Lodge of England in 1717, but the earliestsurviving records of formal Masonic lodges in America are from Boston andPhiladelphia in the early 1730s.19 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en20]The spread of Freemasonry in America occurred through the so-called militarylodges, and by the eve of the War of Independence in 1775 it had becomeextremely popular among the ranking officers and gentry.One of the first American Freemasons was Benjamin Franklin, who was initiated inFebruary 1731 and became Master of the St. John's lodge in the city ofPhiladelphia, where he ‘produced the oldest draft of American lodge by-lawsstill in existence’.20 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en21] Franklin,who had founded the Pennsylvania Gazette in 1729, is also renowned in Masoniccircles for printing (in December 1730) the very first article in America whichreferred to Freemasonry.21 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en22]In those days Freemasonry in America was regulated by the Grand Lodge of Englandwhich appointed ‘Provincial Grand Masters’ in various regions of the NorthAmerican continent. In 1749 Franklin was appointed Provincial Grand Master ofPennsylvania. An intellectual, a brilliant politician and, above all, a cunningagent provocateur, Franklin was to become the key figure in the American revoltagainst Britain and, of course, the most renowned ‘Founding Father’ of theUnited States.Both as a young man and later in his adult life, Franklin passed three sojournsin England – a total of 15 years accumulated between 1724 and 1726, 1757 and1762, and 1765 and 1775. During these lengthy stays no one disputes that hegravitated in his choice of friendships towards influential Freemasons andradical intellectuals. On his return visits to America he became notorious forstirring up dissent against British colonial rule – so much so that the PrivyCouncil of London found it necessary to summon him and severely warn him not torouse anti-British sentiment in the colonies.It was Franklin who, while in England, had encouraged rejection of the Stamp Actimposed by the British on the American colonies (which required settlers to paya tax to certify all legal documents and transactions). Franklin managed tointercept a series of letters written by Thomas Hutchinson, the British governorof Massachusetts, in which several important American political figures werespoken of in very hostile terms. Franklin dispatched copies of these letters tofriends in America who had them published, causing such an outrage that theBritish had to appease the situation by repealing the act.By the spring of 1775 the pressure was mounting against Franklin in England, andhe decided it was time to return to America. He arrived there on 5 May. While hehad been at sea, war had broken out between the British and the Americanrevolutionary forces at Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775.On his arrival in Pennsylvania, Franklin was immediately appointed as a delegateto the Second Continental Congress, the body that was soon to become theCongress of the United States of America. Other newly appointed members wereThomas Jefferson and George Washington. Among the first decisions that theCongress made (on 15 June 1775) was the appointment of Washington ascommander-in-chief of the revolutionary armed forces.Washington was 43 years old in 1775 and Franklin 69. Like Franklin, Washingtonwas a Freemason. He had been initiated into the brotherhood in 1752 atFredericksburg, Virginia, and had been raised a Master Mason the followingyear.22 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en23] John Hancock, a richHarvard gentleman, was president of the Congress at the time. He, too, was aprominent Freemason, later to be remembered for his large signature on theDeclaration of Independence.In September 1776 the Congress agreed to send a commission to France in order toseek military and financial support for the war against Britain. Franklin was amember of the three-man commission. He arrived in Paris just before Christmasthat year. Although France was not at war with England at the time, it wasregarded as its natural enemy and, therefore, sympathetic to the American cause.Franklin immediately struck up friendships with important figures in Frenchsociety and, particularly, among the elite and the Freemasons. To the French hepersonified the unsophisticated nobility of the New World, and he quickly becamethe darling of French society and the hero of the intellectuals and militarygentry. A sort of ‘Franklin cult’ was to emerge, and his portrait was seeneverywhere, from snuffboxes to chamber pots. His company was in great demand byartists, intellectuals and high-society ladies. Spies and informers infested hishouse.Franklin was to engage in secret negotiations with the Count of Vergennes, LouisXVI’s minister for foreign affairs. These negotiations lasted several years, andeventually treaties were signed in 1778 in which France pledged military andeconomic support to the revolutionary cause in America.Meanwhile in Paris Franklin pursued his social and intellectual interests withgusto by joining the illustrious Masonic ‘Nine Sisters’ lodge.23[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en24] This famous lodge was founded in1776 by Jérôme Lalande and the Abbé Cordier de Saint-Fermin, the latter thegodfather of Voltaire. This was the same year that the Declaration ofIndependence was signed in America, with Franklin being the most senior of thesignatories. Lalande was France's most respected astronomer, and wielded muchinfluence amongst Parisian intellectuals.NINE SISTERS LODGEThe Loge Les Neuf Sœurs, the ‘Lodge of the Nine Sisters’, named after the ninemuses of Greek mythology, was in fact the successor of an older lodge, LesSciences, which Lalande had founded in 1766 with the philosopher andmathematician Claude Adrien Helvétius. Helvétius was a staunch advocate ofabsolute atheism whose political and philosophical ideas would much influencethe 1789 Revolution. After the death of Helvétius in 1771, his wife, AnneCatherine Helvétius, joined forces with Lalande and Saint-Fermin in the creationof the Nine Sisters lodge. Her own elite salon in the Rue Sainte-Anne in Pariswas famous throughout Europe, and was dubbed ‘the general headquarters ofEuropean philosophy’.24 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en25] Another ofher salons in Auteuil near Paris maintained very close links with the NineSisters lodge.25 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en26]Not surprisingly, Franklin was a regular visitor to Mme Helvétius's salon.Another was the Marquis de Lafayette, a young officer in the French army.Lafayette belonged to a Masonic lodge, Le Contrat Social, which was linked toother important lodges throughout France. Notable amongst these was the lodge LaSociété Olympique, with its membership of young officers such as the Count deChambrun, the Count-Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse, the Count-AdmiralCharles Hector d’Estaing and the buccaneer John Paul Jones – all of whom wouldfight for the American cause a few years later.26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en27]In 1777 Franklin became the ‘Venerable Master’ of the Nine Sisters lodge and in1778 he was given the ultimate honour of assisting in the initiation of the84-year-old Voltaire. It is said that the aging Voltaire was supported on thearms of Franklin and Antoine Court de Gébelin, the Swiss-French inventor of themodern esoteric Tarot.27 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en28]In April 1777 Franklin's agent in Paris, the diplomat Sileas Deane, succeeded inrecruiting the young Marquis de Lafayette, then only 19 years old, anddispatching him to America to serve under Washington.28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en29]All in all therefore there is ample evidence of Masonic activity – in France –focussed on the care and nurture of the American Revolution and centred aroundFranklin and the Nine Sisters lodge. Such evidence is suggestive but does notpermit us to deduce that the Nine Sisters lodge and/ or Freemasonry in generalwere also responsible for the violent eruptions in Paris on 14 July 1789 withthe storming of the Bastille and the total revolution that followed.Still, the suspicion lingers. As the French historian Bernard Fay explains:The revolutionary impulse, the revolutionary funds, the revolutionary leaders,during the first two years of the Revolution, came from the privileged classes.If the Duc d’Orléans, Mirabeau, Lafayette; if the Noailles family, the LaRochefoucauld, the Bouillon, the Lameth and other liberal nobles had notdeserted the nobility in order to join the cause of the people and theRevolution, the revolutionaries would have been deprived of this advantage whichallowed them to triumph from the outset. Now, all these nobles who rallied inhaste to the cause of new ideas, although at the end they lost their fortunes,their situation, their ranks, and their lives, were Freemasons and we cannotattribute this to hazard, unless we ignore the evidence.29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en30]Not surprisingly, Bernard Fay also sees the Nine Sisters lodge as being thefocus of the activities that marked the early years of the French Revolution.This lodge, as we know, harboured not only several key players in both theFrench Revolution and the ‘sister’ American Revolution, but also writers,intellectuals, politicians and artists who used their talents to extol thevirtues of the Republic. ‘It is certain’, writes Masonic historian Jean-AndréFaucher, that:… the Freemasons [of the Nine Sisters lodge and other lodges] who contributed tothe collapse of the monarchy and to the success of the Revolution were in greatnumbers.30 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en31]Another alleged member of the Nine Sisters lodge was the brilliant trainedorator, lawyer and self-made politician George Jacques Danton. He is credited bymany scholars with the pivotal role in toppling the French monarchy and in thecreation of the First Republic in September 1792. He was also the founder of theinfamous Club des Cordeliers, an ultra-radical revolutionary society officiallyknown as the Society of the Friends of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.ROBESPIERRE AND THE CULT OF THE SUPREME BEINGDanton was one of the so-called Triumvir, contesting the control of the Republicwith two other revolutionary leaders, Robespierre and Marat – the latter aFreemason. It has never been conclusively established that Robespierre was aFreemason too. Nevertheless, his intellectual ideals and obsession with the‘virtues’, as well as his promotion of the Cult of the Supreme Being, all reekof Masonic influence.In Freemasonry God is often described as the ‘Grand Architect of the Universe’.His symbol is either a five-pointed star – the ‘Blazing Star’, in which isdepicted the letter ‘G’ – or a glowing pyramid or triangle with theall-seeing-eye, (the ‘Eye of Providence’) inscribed within it. This symbol canstill be seen on the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizenand appears quite obviously to have been modelled on the ‘Supreme Being’ of theFreemasons – likewise symbolised by the all-seeing-eye in the glowing pyramid.English Freemasonry in particular has gone to great lengths to assert thatbelief in a Supreme Being is a precondition of membership.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en32] Thus in an official statement bythe ‘Board of General Purposes’, ratified by the United Grand Lodge of England,it was confirmed that:The Board has given the most earnest consideration to this subject, beingconvinced that it is of fundamental importance to the reputation and well-beingof English Freemasonry that no misunderstanding should exist on either side ofthe Craft. It cannot be too strongly asserted that Masonry is neither a religionnor a substitute for religion … On the other hand, its basic requirement thatevery member of the Order shall believe in a Supreme Being and the stress laidupon his duty towards Him should be sufficient evidence to all but the willfullyprejudiced that Masonry is an upholder of religion since it requires a man tohave some form of religion before he can be admitted as a Mason … 32[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en33]The above statement was, in fact, construed from the Constitutions ofFreemasons, drafted in 1723, where in the so-called First Charge, which isentitled ‘Concerning God and Religion’, the following statement appears:Let a man's religion or mode of worship be what it may, he is not excluded fromthe Order, provided he believe in the Glorious Architect of Heaven and Earth …33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en34]The term ‘Supreme Being’ is widely used in the information literature of theUnited Grand Lodge where, for example, an official leaflet declares that‘members must believe in a Supreme Being, but there is no separate MasonicGod’.34 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en35] In other Masonic pamphletsthe term ‘Grand Architect of the Universe’ is also extensively used. Clearly nodistinctions are made between terms like ‘Glorious Architect of Heaven andEarth’, ‘Grand Architect of the Universe’ and ‘Supreme Being’. All are, quiteobviously, considered appropriate and interchangeable epithets for the Masonicidea of ‘God’.Taking into account that most of the main players of the French Revolution wereFreemasons (including fellow Triumvir members Danton and Marat), and givingthought to the terminology used by Robespierre for his republican cult, it isdifficult to avoid the conclusion that his Supreme Being was one and the same asthe Masonic ‘Grand Architect of the Universe’. Indeed, the historian MichelVovelle, an expert on cults of the French Revolution, quite readily equates the‘Supreme Being’ of Robespierre with the ‘Grand Architect’ of the Freemasons.35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en36]ROUSSEAU AND THE CONTRAT SOCIALIt is well known that Robespierre was much influenced by the work ofJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712 – 1778), the writer and philosopher whose ContratSocial (a political tract which extolled the virtues of social equality and thedignity of man), set the foundation for the Declaration of the Rights of Man andof the Citizen, the natural successor to the American Declaration ofIndependence.Although Rousseau was not a Freemason, French Masons took many of hisphilosophical and political ideas as gospel – so much so that one of the mostimportant and influential pre-revolutionary Masonic lodges, La Loge du ContratSocial, was named in his honour. It must be remembered that both Voltaire andRousseau were – and still are – regarded as having been the intellectual dynamosbehind the Revolution. It would be going too far to say that they actuallycaused it, but it is fair to say that they provided the moral framework uponwhich the Revolution rested.Thus it is not at all surprising to find that the two most important Masoniclodges in France in the years immediately preceding the 1789 Revolution were theNine Sisters and Le Contrat Social, the former linked to Voltaire and hisgodfather, and the latter to Rousseau's political masterpiece bearing the samename. It was at these lodges that many of the protagonists of both the Frenchand American Revolutions would gather.Le Loge du Contrat Social was founded in Paris in 1776 at the same time as theNine Sisters lodge. Originally going under the name of Loge Saint-Lazare, it hadtaken over the function of an older lodge, La Loge Saint-Jean d’Écosse de lavertu persécutée based at Avignon, the latter acting as the ‘Mother Lodge’ forone of Freemasonry's elite orders, the so-called Scottish Rite, also known asthe Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree.36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en37]Almost as popular as the Nine Sisters lodge, Le Contrat Social recruited itsmembers from the very best of the liberal nobility, the intellectuals and themilitary. Under its warrant other lodges were set up all over France, the mostnotable being the lodges Saint-Alexandre d’Écosse and l’Olympique de la ParfaiteEstime.37 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en38] The name of the ContratSocial lodge had, in fact, been chosen by one of Jean-Jacques Rousseau'sintimate friends, the Baron d’Astier38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en39] who, like Robespierre and manyother intellectuals of the Revolution, practically deified Rousseau. In April1794 Robespierre even had Rouseau's body exhumed and reburied at the Pantheon inParis next to other national heroes.39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en40]DESIGNER CULTRobespierre's Cult of the Supreme Being was officially installed in France on 7May 1794, a little more than a year after the beheading of Louis XVI. By thenthe de-Christianisation process had taken its toll, with the clergy abdicatingen masse, and many Christian places of worship converted into ‘temples’ for thenew revolutionary cult.Although a staunch anti-clerical, Robespierre was not an atheist. He was topresent a report to the Convention on the ‘principles of political moralitywhich must guide the Convention in the administration of the internal affairs ofthe Republic’ in which he stated:… the idea of the Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul is a perpetualreminder of Justice. It is thus social and republican.40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en41]The Convention agreed, decreeing soon after:The People of France recognise the existence of the Supreme Being and theImmortality of the Soul.41 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en42]‘A deist in the mould of Rousseau’,42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en43] Robespierre firmly believed that atthe true basis of the new democratic state should be a natural religion, onethat was intrinsic to the human condition, one that could root the virtues ofthe nation onto ‘eternal and sacred foundations’.43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en44] It was proposed that the cult wouldconsist of celebrations and gatherings throughout the year – Robespierre wanted36 festivals in all44 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en45] – devotednotably to the important events of the Revolution (such as 14 July), to variousentities and concepts such as the Supreme Being, Nature, Liberty, and Equality,and finally to the ‘virtues most useful to man’ such as Truth, Patriotism and soforth.As part of Robespierre's cult, the old Gregorian calendar was abandoned infavour of a ‘Republican’ calendar with the months given ‘natural’ names. Thisnew calendar was divided into 36 decadi of 10 days each, producing a year of 360days to which were added 5 ‘complementary’ days to commemorate ‘virtue, genius,labour, opinion and rewards’.45 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en46]It is indeed odd to discover that this Republican calendar appears to have beenmodelled on the ancient Egyptian solar calendar – which was divided into 36decans each of 10 days, producing a year of 360 days to which five additionaldays were added to commemorate the virtues of Osiris, Isis and other divinities.LALANDE AND SIRIUSThe task of developing the Republican calendar was given to Charles-GilbertRomme, a respected mathematician and president of the Committee of PublicInstruction. According to Masonic historian Charles Sumner Lobingier, Romme wasa prominent Freemason of the Nine Sisters lodge.46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en47] Romme was assisted in technicalmatters by the mathematician Gaspard Monge and the mathematician-astronomerJoseph-Louis Lagrange. Monge, too, was a staunch Freemason and a prominentmember of the Nine Sisters lodge which in turn had been founded by theastronomer Jérôme Lalande, who had served as director of the Paris Observatorysince 1768.Lalande, and the astronomer-historian Charles-François Dupuis, sat on thecommittee established by Romme to create the new Republican calendar. Dupuis wasa firm believer that all religious ideas stemmed from ancient Egypt and, moreparticularly, that the city of Paris was somehow associated with the Egyptiangoddess Isis. We shall return to this later. Meanwhile, David Ovason, in hisintriguing book The Secret Zodiac of Washington DC, makes this most revealingcomment concerning Lalande during the obituary ceremony for Voltaire at the NineSisters lodge in November 1778:The French astronomer Joseph [Jérôme] Lalande, so used to standing in thedarkness while looking up at the stars, would probably have thought of only onestar as he stood in the darkened Parisian room on 28 November 1778. In hiscapacity as Master of the Lodge of Nine Muses [Sisters], Lalande was mourningwith his Brothers [of which one was Benjamin Franklin] the passing of the writerVoltaire … Among the symbols guarded by the 27 Brothers was a pyramid … As hegazed at the Pyramid. Lalande would almost certainly have been drawn to thinkingabout the star Sirius. An astronomer who had shown great interest in ancientorientations, he could not help realising the importance assigned to this starby the ancients. If the Egyptian Pyramids themselves were not aligned to it, heknew fully well that a large number of Egyptian temples had been, and that anentire Egyptian calendar was regulated by it. In his four-volume study ofstellar lore, Lalande had listed six alternative names for Sirius, and gave itsposition in 1750 with remarkable accuracy. His interest was almost personal: hewould have known that in the horoscope of his own birth, the sun and Mercury hadbracketed this powerful star.47 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en48]Ovason also points out that Lalande's involvement with and deep admiration forVoltaire make it very likely that he would have been familiar with Voltaire'sbook Micromégas published in 1752. In this curious work of fiction Voltaire setthe home of the hero in the star Sirius and prophetically noted that this staralso had a satellite – a fact only discovered to be true in 1844 by the Prussianastronomer Friedrich Bessel.48 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en49]Sirius, of course, was also the star identified by the ancient Egyptians withthe goddess Isis – and again Lalande would have known this.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en50] Indeed, so interested were Lalandeand Dupuis in the goddess Isis that one of their colleagues at the Académie desSciences could not help commenting:‘MM. Dupuis et de Lalande voient Isis par-tout!’ [‘Messrs. Dupuis and Lalandesee Isis everywhere!’]50 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en51]MONGE, ISIS AND OSIRISThere is another connection with Egypt and the Republican calendar which needsto be mentioned. The mathematician Gaspard Monge, who worked out the mechanicsof the calendar, was a keen student of Egyptology. Through his close friendshipwith Napoleon Bonaparte, whom he accompanied to Egypt in 1798, he was to foundthe Institut d’Égypte in Cairo.Like many Freemasons of his time, Monge believed that Masonic rituals hadoriginated in ancient Egypt and that modern Freemasons had inherited ancientEgypt's secret system of initiation and symbolic language. Even today, confirmsa Masonic historian:Many Freemasons consider that the Masonic Order draws much of its mysteries fromPharaonic Egypt. It is thus that they refer themselves to Osiris and Isis,symbols of the supreme being and universal nature …51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en52]CELEBRATIONS AND ICONOGRAPHYThe first official celebrations held in honour of the Supreme Being underFrance's new Republican calendar took place on 8 June 1794.At the heart of the proceedings, organised by Robespierre's close friend theartist Jacques-Louis David, was a huge amphitheatre in the Tuilleries Garden infront of the Louvre Palace. There the official congregation gathered to listento a sermon preached by Robespierre in honour of the Supreme Being. At the closeof the sermon, David had arranged for the dramatic burning of a Hessian clothstatue representing ‘Atheism’ – from which emerged, like a phoenix from theflames, a stone statue representing ‘Wisdom’.Next the choir of the Paris Opera sang:Father of the Universe, Supreme Intelligence, Benefactor unknown to mortals. Youwill reveal your existence to those who alone raise altars in your name.52[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en53]‘Those who raise altars’ were, of course, the Republicans; and the ‘altar’ inthis particular case turned out to be a massive artificial mountain (historianJean Kerisel calls it a ‘pyramid’) in the heart of the Champs de Mars, wheretoday stands the Eiffel Tower.53 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en54]Representatives of the 48 districts of Paris as well those of the Conventionwith Robespierre at the helm, made their way to the pyramid/mountain andascended its flanks. Robespierre then was raised on the summit next to asymbolic ‘Tree of Liberty’, while patriotic hymns were sung by the Paris Operachoir.Let us note that in the iconography of the Revolution the all-seeing-eye (or‘Eye of Providence’) was often shown above the ‘Tree of Liberty’ while at othertimes it was also seen within a glowing triangle or pyramid hovering above thescene, much like the symbol seen today on the US one-dollar bill. This symbol,in fact, was originally designed for the so-called Great Seal of the UnitedStates in 1776 by a committee that included Benjamin Franklin and ThomasJefferson.54 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en55] The very same symbolwas also to appear in 1789 on the frontispiece of the Declaration of the Rightsof Man and of the Citizen drafted by the Marquis de Lafayette, a close friend ofboth Franklin and Jefferson. The symbol clearly represents the Supreme Being ofthe Republicans and, by extension, the Masonic ‘Grand Architect of the Universe’– also depicted as a pyramid with the all-seeing-eye or ‘Eye of Providence’. Inone propaganda poster which has survived from the 1789 Revolution, theall-seeing-eye is portrayed above the words ‘Être Suprême’, i.e. ‘SupremeBeing’, which confirms the link between the two ideas.55[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en56] In this poster the ‘eye’ is notwithin a pyramid but inside a solar disc from which shoot down golden rays oflight on the ‘People’ and the ‘Republic’. There are two figures on the bottom ofthe poster, the one on the left is the aging Voltaire, and the one on the rightis Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the two intellectual heroes of the Revolution.56[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en57]This sort of iconography and rhetoric is strongly suggestive of an attempt topush forward some sort of deist-cum-Masonic ‘religion’ as an alternative toChristianity. And as British historian Nigel Aston remarks in his book Religionand Revolution in France, the ‘belief in the Supreme Being permitted enoughvariations to accommodate many tastes.’57[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en58] Aston quotes the patriot LazareCarnot, a Freemason and also a member of the Convention, who, made a speech in1794 extolling the many virtues of mankind, and explained:… these are things to be found in the Supreme Being; he is the seal of allthoughts which make for the happiness of man.58[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en59]MEANWHILE, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC …This perhaps unpremeditated association of the ‘Supreme Being’ with the idea ofa seal brings to mind the Great Seal of the United States, which not onlydisplays the ‘Supreme Being’ with the symbol of the glowing pyramid and theall-seeing-eye, but also is an icon of the individual's constitutional right tothe pursuit of happiness.On 18 September 1793, just a few weeks after the festivities that were staged atthe Place de la Bastille by David, another sort of ceremony, this time blatantlyMasonic, took place across the Atlantic at the site of the future Capitol inWashington, DC. Wearing a Masonic apron given to him by the Marquis deLafayette, George Washington laid the cornerstone of the Capitol on JenkinsHeights during a ceremony attended by hundreds of Freemasons. The Masonic apronworn by Washington, which had been embroidered by Mme de Lafayette, contained anassortment of well-known Masonic symbols, but its centrepiece is undoubtedly theall-seeing-eye emblazoned by a radiating sun disc. Interestingly, author DavidOvason, a Freemason who has conducted extensive research into the meaning ofthis Masonic ceremony, concluded that it was, among other things, primarilyintended to consecrate both this building as well as the Federal City to thezodiacal constellation of Virgo:… The idea of Virgo plays an important role in the astrological symbolism whichdominates the city. I have also examined two foundation ceremonials in which theVirgoan element was of considerable importance. By taking this approach I mighthave given the impression that the sole Masonic concern in these early years ofthe building of the Federal City was with Virgo … The importance of Virgo, andher connection with the goddess Isis, has been recognised in Masonic circlesfrom the very early days of American Masonry. The French astronomer Joseph[Jérôme] Lalande had been an important Mason, and his writings were widely readby Americans of the late 18th century. As early as 1731, Lalande had recognisedthat: ‘The Virgin is consecrated to Isis, just as Leo is consecrated to herhusband Osiris … The sphinx, composed of a Lion and a Virgin, was used as asymbol to designate the overflow of the Nile … they put a wheat-ear in the handof the Virgin, to express the idea of months’…59[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en60]In his book Inside The Brotherhood, Masonic researcher Martin Short has this totell us about George Washington's affiliation to Freemasonry:His [Washington's] funeral in 1799 had been conducted according to Masonicrites. The coffin had been draped with a Masonic apron given to him by a brotherrevolutionary and Mason, the Marquis de Lafayette, and the many Masons presenteach cast a sprig of acacia, to symbolise both Osiris's resurrection andWashington's own imminent resurrection in the realm where Osiris presides.60[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en61]It is perhaps significant that the national memorial later built in Washington,DC in honour of George Washington was in the form of a huge Egyptian-styleobelisk, and that on its eastern entrance was displayed the ancient Egyptiansymbol of the solar disc. It is reported that during the dedication ceremony aprominent Mason read a speech and, after extolling the virtues of Freemasons,added those strange words:Their minds enlightened with divine love, their hearts radiant with discoveringof pure love, their souls cherishing – like the ancient Egyptian worshippers ofOsiris – the hope of immortality.61 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en62]We shall see later how many of the symbols involved with the cornerstoneceremonies of the Capitol and the Washington Monument were veiled with symbolisminvolving the ‘star of Isis’ i.e. Sirius. Meanwhile we hope that it has becomefairly evident that, for reasons and motives not yet too clear, the ceremonies,festivities, and city monuments associated with the ‘sister’ American and FrenchRevolutions display Masonic ideas and imagery and, perhaps even more intriguing,are heavily tinged with ‘Egyptian’ connotations and symbols."},{"pageContent":"PART I:THE SECRET FATITH"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOLOST WORLDMixed with the many other currents and forces that are acknowledged to havedriven the French Revolution we've tried to demonstrate in Chapter One thatpowerful religious and spiritual energies were also at play. These energiessurfaced visibly in an aggressive de-Christianisation campaign that saw greatcathedrals, including the famous Notre Dame in Paris, reconsecrated as templesof the ‘Supreme Being’. Throughout the land, ancient Egyptian and other ‘pagan’images were substituted for Christian symbols, notably the cross, and evenancient Egyptian deities such as the goddess Isis were venerated. The Conventionwas thus not referring to the God of the Christians, or to the Christian visionof the afterlife, when it affirmed in 1794 that the ‘People of France recognisethe existence of the Supreme Being and the Immortality of the Soul.’Strange and startling though these developments were, the late 18th century wasnot the first time that a religion utterly opposed to Christianity, showingsigns of an ancient Egyptian influence, and deeply interested in the fate of thesoul, had taken root in the land we now know as France. In the 12th century,more than 600 years before the Revolution, just such an alternative religion hadmaterialised in Provence and Langeudoc – seemingly out of nowhere – alreadydeeply entrenched in the hearts and minds of large sectors of the population. Itwas also present in force in adjoining districts of eastern Spain and northernItaly, and scattered in smaller communities throughout the rest of Europe as farafield as Belgium, northern France and Germany.The name of this religion that had so rapidly and successfully displaced theRoman Catholic Church in areas so close to the seat of its own power was …Christianity.At any rate its practitioners called themselves ‘Good Christians’, but theChurch, labelled them heretics from the moment they first came to its attention.Their contemporaries in the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries frequently called themManichees (after the ancient dualist heresy of Manicheism, supposedly wiped outin Europe hundreds of years previously). And they were known by a wide varietyof other epithets including, most commonly, Albigensians (after Albi, aprominent city of Languedoc), and Cathars (derived from the Greek word katharosand meaning the ‘Pure’).1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en63]These Cathars (the name that we will generally use here) venerated Jesus Christevery bit as much as the Catholics did. That was why they called themselves‘Good Christians’. But the place that he occupied in their religion wasradically different. In the Catholic view Christ was the ‘Word … made flesh’ who‘dwelt among us’.2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en64] The Catharsrepudiated this utterly and worshipped him as a being of pure spirit – anemanation from the ‘Good God’, a projection or an apparition. They categoricallydenied his material incarnation as the ‘Son’ of God, born in a human body to‘dwell among us’. They also forcefully rejected the Catholic teaching of Christcrucified to redeem our sins. How could he have been crucified, they asked, ifhe had never existed physically in the first place? Far from revering thecentral spiritual symbol of Christianity, therefore, the Cathars denied thesignificance of the cross. For them it was an obscene instrument of torture thatthe Church of Rome had misled millions into worshipping as an idol.Turning the most cherished symbols, doctrines and dogmas of Christianity upsidedown like this was a Cathar speciality that infuriated and repeatedly challengedthe medieval Catholic Church.The source of the problem was that unlike the single all-powerful and all-goodGod of the Christians, the Cathars were dualists who believed in the parallelexistence of two deities – a God of Good and a God of Evil. Each was powerfulonly in his own domain and nearly impotent in the realm of the other. The domainof the God of Good was entirely spiritual, intangible, immaterial and filledwith Light. It was here that human souls had originated – the creation of theGood God. The domain of the God of Evil was the earth itself, the material worldand all physical life upon it – an infernal place of pain and punishment filledwith Darkness and iniquity. In the Cathar scheme of things it was the God ofEvil, the maker and ruler of the material world, who had fashioned the bodies(though not the souls) of mankind out of ‘mud and water’. And it was towardsthis same Evil God, Cathar preachers argued, that the worship of the RomanCatholic Church was directed.The pope, in other words, was not a servant of the Good God but the Devil'srepresentative on earth. And the purpose of the Catholic Church was not totransmit our souls to the spiritual and light-filled domain of heaven afterdeath, but to trick us into returning again and again – in one human incarnationafter another – to the hell-realm of the material world. Only a lifetime ofself-denial culminating in the special gnosis – or inspired knowledge – attainedon initiation into the highest grade of the Cathar faith could save us.It was a revolutionary teaching and, in 12th century Europe, an extremelydangerous one.HESITATING AT THE CROSSROADSDuring the period of world history for which written records have survived –most of the last 5,000 years – no scholar would seriously argue with theproposition that religions have played a fundamental role in shaping thecharacter of civilisation and directing its course. Likewise few would disputethat the human race during this period has consistently been divided not only bydifferent languages and cultures but also by the competing spheres of influenceof different religions. Some ancient faiths that once commanded absoluteobedience across vast areas have withered away and vanished. Others that wereinsignificant have risen to prominence. Others still are almost forgotten intheir original homelands but have flourished in distant lands. Against therecent background of rampant secularism in many rich countries, and rampantreligious fervour in many poor ones, we are left today with four great faithscommanding distinct socio-geographic spheres of influence, that stillcollectively claim the allegiance of roughly nine of every ten of us:• Hinduism is strong only in the Indian subcontinent but there it has over 800million adherents.• Buddhism sprawls from Sri Lanka to Tibet, and from China to Southeast Asia andJapan.• Islam has hundreds of millions of followers in Indonesia, Bangladesh,Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, the Levant and North Africa, but its heartland andhistorical home is in the Arabian peninsula.• Christianity has a near-monopoly in the Americas, having obliterated orutterly marginalised all the New World's indigenous faiths during the past 500years. It also predominates in Australia, New Zealand, sub-Saharan Africa andother areas of former European colonial expansion. It's historical home is inthe eastern Mediterranean. However, after the triumph of Islam in the MiddleEast and North Africa more than a thousand years ago, Christianity's heartlandmoved to Europe itself.Today, as a result, it is a habit of mind to think of Europe as a region lockedso firmly and for so long within the Christian sphere of influence that no otherfaith need be considered to have shaped its destiny. For scholars prepared tolook hard enough there are, of course, faint traces of earlier, pagan beliefs inthe European heritage, but these are rarities and throwbacks – quaint exoticawith no mainstream impact. Whether we travel to Austria, Belgium, Britain,France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain orSwitzerland, the reality is that all the countries of Europe confront us withvery long unbroken traditions of Christianity. In some cases these traditionssubstantially predate the fourth century AD when the Roman Empire underConstantine adopted Christianity as its state religion and established Rome(where a persecuted Christian community had already existed for 250 years3[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en65]) as the headquarters of the newlyempowered Catholic Church.Almost immediately after coming into imperial favour the formerly persecutedchurch fathers themselves turned persecutors. They sought to impose theircontrol on Christians throughout the Roman Empire, to suppress schisms and todistil a universally agreed doctrine out of the great variety of teachings thatthe faith had previously encompassed. To this end, as we will see in laterchapters, they promulgated dogmas and defined and declared anathemas upon awhole series of heresies. These were then systematically hunted down andobliterated over the next three centuries.Notable among the forbidden faiths was the great dualist heresy of Manicheism(to which no less a figure than Saint Augustine, one of the four most revered‘doctors of the Church’, had belonged for nine years before converting toChristianity in AD 386).4 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en66] Claimingto lead to direct and personal knowledge of the divine, all forms of Gnosticismwere also persecuted to vanishing point. Influenced by elements of the ancientEgyptian religion, Asian and Middle Eastern mysticism, Greek philosophy, andalternative interpretations of Jewish and Christian teachings, Gnosticism was asprofoundly dualistic as Manicheism and was for some centuries the chief rival toRoman Catholic hegemony.5 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en67]By the seventh century, however, Manicheism had been expelled to the distantEast, and the numerous Gnostic sects that had confronted the early church seemedto have been obliterated.6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en68] Nolonger facing any organised spiritual competition, Catholicism was able to seeout the remainder of the Western Dark Ages with its defences relaxed. Theresult, by the early 11th century, was that churchmen had no living experienceof heresy. Those who sought to remind themselves of its dangers could only turnto books – amongst them Saint Augustine's agonised account of his own ‘errors’as a ‘Manichee’ written 700 years earlier.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en69]It therefore came as a something of a jolt when a heresy (looking very much likeManicheism) suddenly resurfaced in the 12th century in the form of Catharism inareas at the very heart of Western culture. Moreover it proved to be notransitory movement linked to the lives of a few charismatic leaders but themost deadly threat ever to confront the Catholic faith. Appearing as though fromnowhere it was a well-organised ‘anti-Church’ that claimed an antiquity evengreater than that of Catholicism itself. It also had the temerity to recruit itsnew members directly from Catholic ranks.What made Catharism such a threat and outrage to the Catholic Church, however,was not just its embarrassing success at converting Catholics, nor the challengeof its doctrines – radical though they were. Nor was it simply the shock ofconfronting a dualist heresy that seemed to have conjured itself up out of thepast like a ghost. Nor was it the heresy's obvious dynamism, nor theuncomfortably rapid spread of its sphere of influence ever closer to Rome duringthe 12th century. The real problem was that as well as winning over largenumbers of ordinary people, Catharism had succeeded in attracting the tacit andsometimes even the overt support of some of the most powerful noble families insouthwestern Europe. These included, most notably, the Counts of Toulouse, theCounts of Foix, and the Trencavel viscounts who ruled the walled cities of Albi,Béziers and Carcassonne. With their knights and castles and strength of armsconcentrated in the Languedoc and surrounding areas, such men had transformedCatharism into something that the Church of Rome had never faced before. Herewas a heresy that could fight back, that would not easily be crushed by the useof secular force, and that might conceivably, if allowed to grow further, pushthe Catholic religion out of Europe altogether.For more than a century, with consequences that reach us today, Europeancivilisation hesitated at the crossroads of two competing spiritual systems andconfronted the choice of two very different ways forward into the future. Let'stake a closer look at the key players and events during this decisive period ofhistory.A LANGUAGE IN WHICH ‘OC’ MEANS ‘YES’Languedoc today is part of the colourful mosaic of southern France. It adjoinsProvence to the east and is separated from Spain to the west by the Pyreneesmountains. In the 12th and 13th centuries it was famed for the romantic poetryof its troubadours, for its ‘Courts of Love’,8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en70] for the fiercely independentcharacter of its people, and for its unique culture.Underlining this sense of difference was the basic fact that the people ofProvence and Languedoc had never been French subjects and did not even speakFrench. Indeed at that time what the word ‘France’ conjured to mind for most wasjust the Ile de France, the region immediately around Paris. More broadlydefined, ‘France’ also included the territories lying between the Loire, themiddle part of the Meuse and the Scheldt. But the lands to the south of theLoire and south of the Massif Central, as well as the whole of the Mediterraneancoast, were excluded. As late as the 14th century travellers heading north fromToulouse or Avignon thought of themselves as journeying to ‘France’ rather thanwithin it.9 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en71]Together with the regions of Limousin and old Aquitaine, and the southern partof the French Alps, Languedoc and Provence were known in medieval times by thecollective name of Occitania. They by no means formed a ‘state’ or a ‘country’as we understand those concepts today. On the contrary, other than to family,friends and neighbours, the primary loyalties of the majority of the inhabitantswere to the town or city in which they lived or to the aristocrats whose fieldsthey ploughed. Still they had much more in common with each other than they didwith the cultural and political community of northern states that were in theprocess of becoming ‘France’. And above all else these ‘Occitanians’ were unitedby their common language, literally the langue d'oc – that is to say thelanguage in which the word for ‘yes’ is oc (as opposed to the langue d'oil, the12th century language that was to evolve into modern French, in which the wordfor ‘yes’ was oil – later to become the more familiar oui of today).Medieval scholar Joseph Strayer points out that the French of the north and theOccitan of the south are separated by one of the sharpest breaks in the wholefamily of Romance languages and are mutually incomprehensible. Occitan is,however, very close to Catalan and quite close to Castilian. The result is thatin the 12th century:A merchant from Narbonne would have been easily understood in Barcelona, whilehe would have needed an interpreter in Paris … A baron of the Ile de Francewould have found more men to talk to in London, or even in Cologne, than hewould have in Toulouse. Now a language barrier is not an impassable obstacle,but it is a real one, and it is the kind of barrier that createsmisunderstandings and suspicions.10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en72]THE MAILED FIST OF OCCITANIAPower in Occitania was in the hands of a feudal aristocracy dominated by thethree great families of Foix, Trencavel and Toulouse.Described at the time as ‘the peers of kings, the superiors of dukes andcounts’,11 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en73] the princes of the houseof Toulouse ruled a domain extending from Toulouse itself to Nimes in the east,and from Cahors in the north to Narbonne on the Mediterranean coast.12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en74] They also enjoyed, and couldsometimes call upon, an impressive range of international alliances. Raymond VI,Count of Toulouse from 1194 – 1222, for example, was a cousin of the king ofFrance and brother-in-law to the kings both of England and of Aragon.13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en75] He also tolerated and sometimeseven promoted Catharism and travelled with a Cathar holy man.14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en76]The Counts of Foix, lords of the high Pyrenees along the border with Spain, wererenowned for their military prowess, stubborn ruthlessness, and strong Catharconnections. In 1204 Raymond-Roger, Count of Foix from 1188 – 1223, witnessedthe reception of his widowed sister Esclarmonde into the perfecti (literally the‘perfect’), the highest rank of Cathar initiates.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en77] Two years later his own wife,having born him six children, was also received into the perfecti and retiredfrom the world to preside over the Cathar equivalent of a nunnery.16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en78] Though never avowedly a Catharhimself, Raymond-Roger was staunchly anti-Catholic all his life. On one occasionit seems that soldiers in his employ chopped a canon of the Church into piecesand used ‘the arms and legs of a crucifix to grind up spices with, in lieu of apestle.‘17 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en79] In a lengthy essay on‘the barbarity and malignity of the Count of Foix’ a contemporary pro-Catholicchronicler wrote:His wickedness exceeded all bounds … He pillaged monasteries, destroyedchurches, excelled all others in cruelty.18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en80]The Trencavel dynasty, controlling lands that stretched from the Tarn to thePyrenees, added their own combination of wealth, hereditary influence, militarymight and pro-Cathar sympathies to the equation of power in Languedoc.Raymond-Roger Trencavel, who ruled from 1194 until his capture and murder byCatholics in 1209, had been tutored by the well-known Cathar scholar Bertrand deSaissac. The latter had once shown his contempt for the laws of Catholicism whena monk he disliked was elected abbot at the monastery of Saint Mary of Alet.Bertrand's response was to have the corpse of the former abbot exhumed andplaced, mouldering, in the abbatial chair to supervise a new election. Notsurprisingly the abbot elected on this occasion did meet with Bertrand'sfavour.19 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en81]Support for and involvement with the Cathars, combined with a rejection of theChurch, were not confined solely to the upper levels of the aristocracy. In theLauragais, the populous area between Toulouse and Carcassonne, the minornobility are reported to have been almost solidly Cathar. The same was also thecase for their counterparts in the Corbières between Carcassonne and Narbonne.20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en82] Tellingly it has been calculatedthat 30 per cent of all Cathar perfecti were of noble birth.21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en83] Moreover even the remainingCatholic nobility of Occitania often proved to be at least sympathetic to theCathars – and at times were openly supportive of them. An indication of theirdilemma is to be seen in the reply given by the Catholic knight, Pons d’Adhémarof Rodelle when he was asked by Foulkes, the bishop of Toulouse, why he and hisco-religionists had not expelled the heretics from their lands:We cannot. We have grown up amongst them. We have relatives amongst them, and wesee them living good, decent lives of perfection.22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en84]WEAVING THE THREADS OF THE GREAT HERESYThus sheltered by the aristocracy of the region on both sides of the religiousdivide, the Cathars also found strong support at all other levels of Occitaniansociety. Large numbers of them were skilled craftsmen and artisans. A list ofCathars present in the city of Béziers in 1209 includes:… one noble (baronus), four doctors, five hosiers, two blacksmiths, twopelterers, two shoe-makers, a sheep-shearer, a carpenter, a weaver, a saddler, acorn-dealer, a cutler, a tailor, a tavern-keeper, a baker, a woolworker, amercer, and a money-changer.23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en85]Martin Barber, professor of history at the University of Reading, observes thatthe Béziers list includes no less than 10 individuals employed in the textileindustry, and that a great many other primary documents from the period likewiselink weavers (textores) to the heresy.24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en86]This is true both within and outside the borders of Occitania. In France thegeneral name by which Cathars were known was simply Texerant, the ‘weavers’.25[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en87] In 1145 the renowned Frenchecclesiastic Bernard of Clairvaux undertook a preaching tour to warn against a‘heresy of weavers’.26 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en88] It hadsupposedly sprung up fully formed ‘from the suggestions and artifices ofseducing spirits’27 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en89] and was sosuccessful at winning conversions that:Women have quitted their husbands, men have deserted their wives … Clerks andpriests … often abandon their flocks and their churches, and are found in thethrong, among weavers male and female.28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en90]Likewise in 1157 Archbishop Samson of Rheims was almost certainly complaining ofCathar missionary activity when he spoke of a ‘Manichean plague’ that hadrecently infected the greater part of Flanders29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en91] (we noted earlier that 12th centurychurchmen commonly referred to the Cathars as Manicheans – after the dualistsect of that name that had supposedly been stamped out hundreds of yearspreviously). This new outbreak of the heresy, Samson said, was being spread byitinerant weavers and cloth-merchants.30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en92]The explanation is simple. Employment as weavers and in other sectors of themedieval cloth trade – with its extensive international connections – was chosenas ‘cover’ by Cathar perfecti. They needed cover to avoid early detection byChurch authorities because they were mounting what can only be described as alarge-scale and well-thought-out missionary campaign. The rather gentle, patientand systematic methods that they used to win local trust, and eventuallyconversions to the heresy, have been nicely described by the Canadian historianStephen O’Shea:On the paths and rivers of the Languedoc of 1150 there were not only traders andtroubadours but also pairs of itinerant holy men, recognisable by the thinleather thong tied around the waist of their black robes. They entered villagesand towns, set up shop, often as weavers, and became known for their honest hardwork. When the time came, they would talk – first in the moonlight, beyond thewalls, then out in the open, before the fireplaces of noble and burgher, in thehouses of tradespeople, near the stalls of the marketplace. They asked fornothing, no alms, no obeisance; just a hearing. Within a generation these Catharmissionaries had converted thousands. Languedoc had become host to what would becalled the Great Heresy.31 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en93]THE PERFECTI AND THE CREDENTESThe missionaries were all Cathar perfecti, and, as Stephen O’Shea rightlyobserves, it was their custom – like modern Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses – totravel and evangelise in pairs.32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en94]Their black robes would have given them something of the look of Christian monksor priests. Other than their appearance, however, there was really no similarityat all between the lifestyles of these perfecti and the lifestyles of thetypical Catholic clergy of the period. As even their most bitter opponents werewilling to admit, the distinguishing characteristic of the perfectus was thatthey lived exemplary lives of chastity, humility, great poverty and simplicitythroughout the whole period of Catharism's rise and fall.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en95] Meanwhile the Church of the 11thand 12th centuries had already become decadent and disreputable. It was widelydespised because of the rampant sexual licence of so many of its ministers. Insome areas it was openly hated because of its vast wealth, corruption, greed,and unnecessary ostentation. Doubling as large-scale feudal landlords mostbishops enjoyed lives of profligate, scandalous luxury. No wonder, then, thatthey were unpopular in their own dioceses where they were reviled for theirindifference to the privations of the poor.34[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en96]To understand the extreme asceticism for which the perfecti were renowned, oneneed only recall the teaching that lay at the core of Cathar dualism. Thematerial world was the wholly evil creation of a wholly Evil God. All contactwith matter was therefore also evil and could only inhibit Catharism's primaryproject. This was the gradual purification and eventual release of immortalhuman souls from their cycle of rebirths in mortal human bodies. ‘O Lord, judgeand condemn the imperfections of the flesh,’ went one of their prayers:Have no pity on the flesh, born of corruption, but show mercy to the spirit,which is imprisoned.35 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en97]The perfecti were active participants in what they saw as a cosmic strugglebetween utterly incompatible powers – spirit and matter, good and evil.36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en98] Success in the struggle requiredthem to lead lives in strict accordance with their beliefs and teachings. Sinceflesh was ‘born of corruption’ it followed that any foodstuff thought to haveoriginated from processes of coition and reproduction was absolutely forbiddento them. This meant, in practice that they could eat neither flesh nor fowl, norany of the derivatives from these creatures such as eggs, milk, cheese, cream orlard.37 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en99] Their diet consisted ofbread, vegetables, pulses, fruits and nuts. Inconsistently (to the modern mind)fish were also allowed. This was because of a medieval misconception that fishdid not issue from sexual reproduction but were somehow spontaneously generatedin water or mud.38 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en100]The same anti-reproductive, anti-coital logic meant, of course, that theperfecti must themselves be totally celibate – even an ‘unchaste’ kiss wasbelieved sufficient to destroy their ritual purity. All other bodily needs anddesires brought the same peril and were likewise to be shunned.39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en101] To harden their resistance to thedesire for nourishment they not only rigorously followed the already sparse dietoutlined above but also subjected themselves to lengthy fasts amounting to morethan 70 days a year on bread and water alone.40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en102] The purpose of all theseprivations was to loosen the bonds that imprisoned the soul within the body.41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en103]In pursuit of the same objective, and in order further to minimise theircontacts with the snares and lures of the material world, the perfecti renouncedall property and personal possessions except the clothes they stood up in.42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en104] Many other austerities were alsorequired of them. Despite these, however, there was no shortage of candidatesfor the perfectus grade and the Cathar religion in fact made it very difficultfor anyone to achieve it. Aspiring perfecti underwent a period of training anddirect exposure to the full rigours of the life that they would lead afterinitiation. Known evocatively as the abstinentia, this typically involved threeyears of full-time attachment to a senior perfectus. Only at the end of theabstinentia, if they had conducted themselves satisfactorily, would they becomeeligible for the ritual known as the consolamentum (‘consoling’) that completedtheir own elevation to perfectus status.43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en105]Though often referred to as the ‘priests’ of the Cathar religion, severalresearchers have noted that the perfecti were in reality much closer in terms oftheir austerities, their personal comportment and their function within thefaith to the:… ascetic teachers of the East, the bonzes and fakirs of China or India, theadepts of the Orphic mysteries, or the teachers of Gnosticism.44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en106]This impression is enhanced by contemporary reports which seem to describeperfecti in trancelike or meditative states. One eyewitness speaks of the‘extraordinary sight’ of a Cathar perfectus seated on a chair ‘motionless as atree trunk, insensible to his surroundings.’45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en107]But the Cathar authorities knew very well that a life of meditation, totalchastity, austerity and withdrawal from the material world was beyond the reachof the average mortal. Moreover their society did not – and could not – consistsolely of perfecti and candidate perfecti whose celibacy would provide them withno successors. What was needed was a much wider pool to draw on. This wassupplied by a second grade or rank, far more numerous than the perfecti, knownas the credentes (‘believers’). It was they, in their tens of thousands, whoconstituted the vast majority of all Cathars. It was they who contributed thesocial and economic energy – to say nothing of the military muscle – that madethis religion such a threat to the Church of Rome.What the credentes believed in were the fundamental tenets of the dualist faithconcerning the existence of two gods, the evil nature of matter and theimprisonment of the soul in flesh. They might even aspire, ultimately, tobecoming wandering gurus of perfectus rank themselves. But the reality was thatmost credentes never took up the challenge. Instead, wherever Catharism wasestablished, we know that its credente class lived ordinary lives of no greatself-denial. They married, produced children, owned property, ate well andgenerally enjoyed the world. They certainly attended the simple services andgatherings led by perfecti that were part of the Cathar calendar. Along with allother credentes they likewise accepted and took with extreme seriousness ageneral duty to accommodate the impoverished perfecti on their travels and toprovide them with a strong network and support system. They were also requiredto offer a ritual salute to any perfectus they might encounter. Called themelioramentum this involved triple genuflections and greetings to the perfectusand culminated in the following exchange:Credente: ‘Pray God for me, a sinner, that he make me a good Christian and leadme to a good end.’ Perfectus: ‘May God be prayed that he may make you a good Christian.’The exchange, explains medieval historian Malcolm Lambert, was standardised andhad a special meaning:To be a Good Christian, or a Christian at all, in Cathar belief was to become aPerfect. To come to a good end was to die in possession of the consolamentum,not having forfeited it by lapse. In the exchange and genuflection, Perfect andadherent reminded each other of their own status, the one waiting, not yet freedfrom Satan, the other outside his power, in a unique position.46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en108]Credentes were taught that it was particularly important for them to find aperfectus and to perform the melioramentum if they had in any way been exposedto the contamination of Catholic influences. This was so at least partly becauseobeisance – amounting almost to worship (and referred to in some contexts as‘adoration’) of the perfectus represented a direct and public denial of theCatholic Church.47 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en109] When theprominent credente, the Lady Fidas of St. Michel, travelled to Rome withCountess Eleanor of Toulouse, she cheekily took a Cathar perfectus with her: ‘toworship him in the very chapel of the Pope.’48[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en110]Whether they were nobles or peasants, however, the majority of credentes wouldpostpone until their deathbeds the moment when they felt ready to summon aperfectus to confer upon them the dualist baptism of the consolamentum. It wasan act of momentous importance that filled the recipient with a charge of theHoly Spirit, and, for some, could open the door to the Kingdom of Heaven. Thoughit amounted, on the surface, to nothing more than a short ritual accompanied byprayers and a laying on of hands, the consolamentum was considered to be sopowerful that it was sufficient, by itself – even without years of itinerantausterity – to initiate the dying credente into the ranks of the perfecti. He orshe would thereafter consume only bread and water, avoiding any furthercontamination from the evil world of matter. The hope for those thus consoled,and in a state of ritual purity, might not have been that death would this timebring a final release from the cycle of rebirth in human form, but that itwould, at the very least, bring ‘progress on the chain of being towards it.’49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en111] On occasions when patientsunexpectedly recovered after being consoled they could always return to thenormal life of a credente and to full involvement with the world. In that casethey would have to receive the consolamentum and enter a fast once again whendeath approached or whatever progress their souls might have made in thisincarnation would be lost.It was by no means certain that the next incarnation would bring the soul to abody that would again receive the Cathar teaching (or even, necessarily to ahuman body at all – rather than, say, the body of a donkey – let alone to thebody of a Cathar). Credentes were therefore provided with a strong incentive toreceive the consolamentum in this life (where they knew it was definitelyavailable) but to so juggle things that they did not have to go through with ituntil their deathbed. During the late 12th century when there were large numbersof perfecti on the roads and living in every village, town and city of Occitaniathis was not usually difficult to accomplish. But during the 13th century, as weshall see in Chapters Six and Seven, Catharism became a persecuted faiththroughout Europe – with the greatest attention paid to Occitania. There, amidstdemonic scenes from the lowest circles of hell, the populations of entire citieswere put to the sword by soldiers of the Church of Rome. The papal inquisitorsfollowed and as they went about their work the numbers of per fecti fell into anever more catastrophic decline with each new mass burning. By the early 14thcentury there are only known to have been three perfecti still at work in thewhole of the Languedoc, once the very epicentre of the faith. Survivingcredentes faced great uncertainty as to whether they would be able to obtain theconsolamentum at all. The desperate solution of many Cathars nearing the end oftheir natural lives in these last days was the endura – an Occitan word meaning‘fasting’ or ‘hungering’ applied to the bread and water fast that normallyfollowed deathbed consolings.50 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en112]Now, however, those who had received the ritual preferred not to risk breakingtheir fast even if they later began to show signs of recovery. The consequencewas that the endura:… came to have the precise and technical meaning of fasting to death afterreceiving the consolamentum.51 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en113]ABOLISHING SUPERSTITION AND THE FEAR OF HELLWhen extensive persecution of Catharism began in the 13th century thefundamental difference in lifestyle between the consoled and the unconsoled –between per fecti and credentes – was sometimes seized on by the latter to tryto persuade their accusers that they weren't heretics at all. In the bourg ofToulouse in 1223 for example Jean Teisseire, a credente in the prime of life whohad no interest in an early consolamentum, was arrested and accused of heresy.‘I have a wife and I sleep with her,’ he protested, ‘I have sons, I eat meat andI lie and swear’52 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en114] (along withmarriage, sex, reproduction and meat-eating, lying and the swearing of oathswere forbidden to perfecti).53 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en115]Convicted on the evidence of witnesses, Tessiere's arguments were ignored by thecourt. He was sentenced to burn at the stake and placed in the bishop's prisonto await execution. The procedure now allowed him to recant and go free but hestubbornly continued to profess his innocence and remained on death row. Therehe fell into conversation with several Cathar per fecti and a few days lateraccepted the consolamentum at their hands. Still refusing to recant beliefs thathe now acknowledged he held he was ‘burnt with the rest.’54[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en116]There are many reports of courage and extreme self-sacrifice from the era ofpersecution. They tell us that Catharism was capable of inspiring its adherentswith profound and strongly-held beliefs concerning the progress and afterlifedestiny of the soul. Indeed these beliefs were so strong that again and againperfecti and credentes like Teisseire were prepared to suffer death in theutmost agony rather than recant and jeopardise their imminent release from theevil world of matter.There are several well-attested accounts of the condemned rushing en massetowards the pyres that had been prepared for them and flinging themselvesjoyfully into the roaring flames. Whether we think of them as credulous fools,therefore, or as exalted martyrs, it seems that Catharism had liberated thesepeople from the paralysing fear of hell that the Catholic Church had used forcenturies to terrify and close the minds of medieval Europeans. Indeed such aliberation would have followed more or less automatically from conversion toCathar dualism – which proposed no lower hell than the earth itself, ‘the lowestplane of consciousness to which we sink’55[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en117] – a place of trial and torment inwhich our souls were already undergoing fierce penances and had remained trappedfor countless prior incarnations. Hell, in other words, was not an unknowndestination, to which we would be sent for sins defined by the Catholic Church,but a known one in which we were already present but which it was our destinyone day to escape.In this way, at a stroke, the Cathars not only abolished all fear of death intheir initiates but also sundered bonds of superstition and demonology that hadstalled the progress of Western civilisation throughout the Dark Ages. Seekingto sweep the cobwebs away from all aspects of habitual religious behaviour theysaid that chanting in church ‘deceived simple people’, and ridiculed as anirrational waste of money the Catholic practice of paying alms for souls inpurgatory.56 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en118]By giving exposure and prominence to such ideas – albeit for just a brief periodof history – the Cathars encouraged a new freedom of thought and a new spirit offlexibility and openness to change. The psychologist Arthur Guirdham believesthat this was ‘perhaps their most significant contribution to the emancipationof the common man’57 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en119]:Not to understand this is to fail to realise that Catharism was not only anenlightened but an optimistic creed. Some of the contemporary defenders ofCatharism regard it as a dour, Calvinistic and basically pessimistic religion.Sir Steven Runciman who is, on the whole, very fair in his assessment of theCathars, regards the religion as foredoomed because of its built-in pessimism.Those holding such views are at a loss to explain how such a repressive andpessimistic creed could have spread like wildfire through the most sophisticatedand sceptical region of Europe …58 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en120]A RENAISSANCE AHEAD OF ITS TIME?Catharism's sudden flowering took place at a time when Europe, stimulated by thecontact with the East that the Crusades had brought, was shaking off the slumberof the Dark Ages and rediscovering ancient wisdom in the classical texts. Oftendescribed by historians as the ‘Renaissance of the 12th century’, this period of‘change, experimentation and broadened horizons’59[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en121] ended hundreds of years ofintellectual stagnation. It saw the birth of many new philosophical andscientific ideas, witnessed the rise of the first towering Gothic cathedrals,and experienced far-reaching social and economic changes.Together with the neighbouring parts of eastern Spain and northern Italy wherethe Cathar religion was also strong, the 12th century civilisation of Occitania– urbanised, sophisticated, cosmopolitan – was ‘indisputably ahead of anywhereelse in Europe’.60 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en122] It lay at theepicentre of what promised to become a great upheaval in Western values markedby a spirit of inquiry and the introduction of a gentler, more cosmopolitan andmore tolerant world view. Moreover, had Catharism succeeded in all its aims, wecan be certain that there would have been no place, in this new age, for theCatholic Church – which, as the church of Satan, had for so long led so manysouls astray. Far from succeeding, however, the Cathar heresy was crushed by aseries of violent and genocidal ‘crusades’, unleashed by the Catholic Church inthe first half of the 13th century. The last of the resistance was then slowlyand methodically finished off by the papal Inquisition which was officiallyestablished in 1233 specifically for the repression and extirpation ofCatharism.61 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en123] Had it not been forthe destruction and dislocation wrought by these so-called Albigensian Crusadessome believe that the culture of the Languedoc could have anticipated theRenaissance in Italy by more than two centuries.62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en124]Such speculations are frowned on by mainstream historians.63[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en125] As a result questions like – ‘whatwould have happened to the West if Catharism had won its struggle against theCatholic Church?’ – are rarely given any serious scholarly consideration. Anexception was the French social philosopher and activist Simone Weil. She diedin 1943 as a result of voluntary starvation in sympathy with her compatriotsthen under German occupation. Aged only 34 at the time of her fatal endura Weilhad spent the last few years of her life cultivating a deep interest in theunique culture of 12th century Occitania. She believed Catharism to have beenthe source of all its inspiration. By crushing the Greeks more than 2,000 yearsago, she argued, the Roman Empire had ‘brought sterility to the Mediterraneanbasin’. Only once since then had another civilisation raised its head in thesame region which might have had the capacity to attain ‘a degree of freedom andspiritual creativity as high as that of ancient Greece.’ Snuffed out in the 13thcentury by the Church of Rome, this was the lost Occitanian civilisation of theCathars – which, in Weil's analysis, had somehow plugged itself into much oldercurrents of thought:Little as we know about the Cathars, it seems clear that they were in some waythe heirs of Platonic thought, of the esoteric teachings and mysteries of thatpre-Roman civilisation which embraced the Mediterranean and the Near East …64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en126]Weil was one of those for whom Occitanian civilisation in the 12th and 13thcenturies had conceived the true Renaissance. Its potential had been greatereven than that of the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century. Because Languedocwas the heartland of this precocious civilisation, the brutal engine of theAlbigensian Crusades smashed not just the Cathars but Europe's last living linkwith the ancient wisdom traditions of India, Persia, Egypt and Greece. Bycontrast the centuries that followed the destruction of Languedoc ‘were an essayin totalitarian spirituality.’65 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en127]COSMOPOLITAN CITIESOccitanian society under the influence of the Cathars was anything buttotalitarian. It was far ahead of the rest of Europe in the process ofurbanisation. Its rapidly-expanding cities like Narbonne, Avignon, Toulouse,Montpellier, Béziers, and Carcassonne proudly guaranteed the freedom of thoughtand the economic and political independence of their citizens. Even in his owncity, for example, the Count of Toulouse lacked any executive legal authorityover the citizens and was only obeyed so long as he respected local commonlaw.66 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en128] Narbonne, Avignon,Montpellier and Béziers were hives of intellectual activity – in every senseuniversity cities even before their universities had officially been founded.The most advanced course on Aristotle in Europe, which took account of thelatest work by Arab scholars, was taught at Toulouse.67[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en129]Arab merchants and doctors had long found their way to Occitania across thePyrenees from those parts of Spain then under Muslim control, or by sea from theEast. They had been welcomed by the Cathars – who were inclined to see the RomanCatholic Church, not the ‘infidel’, as the natural enemy. Besides, for theCathars, all human bodies, whether Muslim, Christian or Jew, were the prisons ofentrapped souls. Since all suffered the trials and rigours of the material worldequally, and since only Catharism offered a way out of it, the oppression of oneman by another on grounds of race or creed was absurd.Such ideas spilled over into civic life and resident aliens in the cities ofOccitania enjoyed full citizens’ rights, regardless of their nationality orcreed.68 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en130] Moreover while Catharismmaintained its resolute antipathy to the Church of Rome it was open-handed andliberal with other faiths that were willing to co-exist peacefully with it. Thiswas a time when possession of land by non-Christians was a criminal offence innorthern France. It was a time when mobs of Catholics throughout Europe couldfrequently be worked up into frenzies of anti-Semitic prejudice. Yet inOccitania large and long-established Jewish communities owned land, worshippedopenly in synagogues, and prospered unmolested throughout the 12th century.69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en131] They, too, seem to have been goingthrough a period of creative intellectual and spiritual enquiry, just as theCathar communities were. Indeed it was in the coastal cities of Languedoc inthis same period that Jewish savants elaborated the occult philosophy of theCabala and began to explore its implications.70[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en132] A system of mysticism rooted inancient Judaic traditions, Cabala laid claim to secret knowledge and divinerevelation. It also exhibited strong dualistic tendencies in which the ‘leftside’ and ‘right side’ of the cosmos were envisaged in constant opposition andconflict.71 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en133]It is notable that acclaimed schools of Talmudic law flourished at Narbonne,Lunel and Beaucaire in the 12th century and that there is a report from 1160 ofJewish students from ‘distant lands’ studying there.72[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en134] Intriguingly the same source –Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela – also describes an encounter with a Jew at Lunel whohad ‘discarded all worldly business, studied day and night, kept fasts, andnever ate meat.’73 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en135] This suggeststhe possibility that Cathar ideas about how we should live in the world and whatwe are doing here had begun to have an impact not only on the large number offormer Catholics it had freed from the fear of hell but also on the followers ofother faiths as well.CATHARS AND TROUBADOURSIt was in the 12th and 13th centuries that Catharism briefly lit up people'sminds in Occitania. In the same period another extraordinary intellectualphenomenon also appeared and disappeared in precisely the same region nowencompassed by southern France, northern Spain and northern Italy. This parallelphenomenon was the lyric poetry of the troubadours – a form that was invented inOccitania and composed in the Occitan language. Judged by literary experts todayas ‘one of the most brilliant schools that ever existed’, it is accepted as aninfluence on all later European lyrical poetry.74[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en136] Of much greater consequencehowever, is the fact that troubadour poetry also had an unprecedented socialimpact. Indeed it brought about what has been described as ‘a revolution inthought and feeling, the effects of which are still apparent in Westernculture.’75 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en137]The revolution had to do with attitudes towards women in society. Thetroubadours themselves were favoured at the many noble courts of Occitania –where they enjoyed high status and exceptional freedom of speech (sometimes evenintervening in political matters). Launched from this position of eminence theirpoetry focussed respect-filled eyes upon women in general (including such lowlyfigures as shepherdesses), and upon the ladies of the courts in particular,bestowing an exalted, almost saintly, status on the female gender. These poemspromulgated the idea of courtly love in which the male protagonist existed toworship his lady and to serve her faithfully. Such love was adulterous, in thesense that the lady was almost always married, but also pure in the sense thatit was not to be consummated physically.76[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en138] The essence of the whole exercisewas self denial and frustration, longing from afar and the ennoblement ofchastity. In the process the man who must love and yet not touch, must desireand yet never be fulfilled, was raised above the common herd.77[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en139] What was really being celebrated,suggests Zoé Oldenbourg, was ‘nothing else, surely, but the urge to proclaim atriumph of self-will?’78 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en140]Is it a coincidence that Cathar per fecti, too, sought to impose their will overevery physical need and desire, and believed it necessary for their bodies topass through suffering, protracted vigils, deprivation of the senses and manydeaths before that goal could be achieved? For these and other reasons,Oldenbourg believes that there must have been a considerable degree of overlapbetween the troubadour movement and Catharism. She goes so far as to argue thaton many occasions when:… the troubadours … mention God and Jesus Christ it is very probable that theyare speaking as Cathars, and that their deity is the ‘Good God’ of the Manicheanfaith.79 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en141]But Oldenbourg is out of line. It is the concensus of medieval historians andliterary scholars that the ideas diffused through Occitania by the troubadoursin the 12th and 13th centuries had very little and perhaps even nothing at allto do with Catharism.80 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en142] We mayonly comment, with Arthur Guirdham, that this simply makes no sense:How could two such startling manifestations of culture occur at the same timeand in a limited area without their being related to each other? To hold such anopinion is equivalent to saying that the teachings of Freud swept London in the1920s but had no influence on medicine or literature.81[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en143]WOMEN HOLD UP HALF THE SKYIn tandem with the poetry of the troubadours, the basic organisation and beliefsof Cathar religion also had the effect – whether by accident or by design – ofelevating the status of women in Occitanian society. Catholicism had donenothing to dismantle the gross inequalities of the sexes that prevailed in theEuropean Middle Ages and explicitly forbade woman to become priests. Catharism,on the other hand, regarded the souls of men and women as absolutely equal. Itsaw no reason why the material envelopes that they were imprisoned in – namelytheir bodies, which by chance could be either male and female – should betreated with any less equality.For this reason membership of the Cathar perfectus class was not restricted bysex and both men and women could and did become perfecti. On the highways andbyways of these dangerous times Cathar perfectae preached and travelled lessthan their male counterparts82 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en144] –for understandable reasons of physical security. Nor do we find any women amongthe relatively few ‘bishops’ and ‘deacons’ at the top of the simple,low-maintenance and minimally hierarchical structure by which Catharism wasadministered in Occitania. Nevertheless there is no doubt that women were highlyesteemed and enjoyed great influence in their communities83[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en145] where they often established grouphomes for ‘the daughters, widows and dowagers of the local petty nobility andartisan classes’.84 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en146]In practice it is thought that the cadre of active perfecti present in Occitaniaat any one time is likely to have included rather more males than females(perhaps on the order of 6:4), but this resulted from individual choices, notpolicy, and was compensated by a higher ratio of women amongst the credentes.85[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en147]In summary, by contrast with anything the Catholic Church had to offer, thestatus of women within the Cathar faith was high and their role both importantand recognised. This liberation, too, must have played its part in the greatawakening of ideas and human potential that took place in Occitania in the 12thcentury.THE REVOLUTION AND THE NEW WORLD ORDERThe point we wish to make here is that although Catharism was a system ofinspired spiritual knowledge and, in every sense a religion, it was also a greatdeal more than that.We've seen that it was, at one level, a social programme anticipating bycenturies the modern recognition that human potential can never be fullyrealised without ‘women's liberation’. Likewise we've seen how the Cathardoctrine of the equal predicament of souls – and the basic irrelevance of thesex, race or creed of the bodies in which they happen to be trapped – lentitself naturally to the refreshing liberalism, open-mindedness, cosmopolitanismand democratising tendencies of Occitanian society.Catharism was also a comprehensive philosophy of anti-materialism that offeredall who adhered to it a choice of two very clear ways forward in this life – a‘high’ road and a ‘low’ road. The high road was the way of solitary meditationand renunciation of the world – the suppression through willpower of allphysical needs, attachments and desires – that was followed by the perfecti. Thelow road was the way of engagement in the world followed by ordinary credentesuntil they received the consolamentum on their deathbeds. They hoped to makesolid progress in this incarnation in the great project of freeing their soulsfrom the trap of matter but understood that they might need to return again andagain to the material plane before that objective would finally be achieved.Had it been allowed to become widespread and to win dominance over the CatholicChurch throughout Europe we cannot say what the long-term political and economicconsequences of such a philosophy might have been. Simple logic suggests that itwould have been most unlikely to have led to either of the two great politicaland economic systems – capitalism and communism – that were ultimately todominate human affairs in the 19th and 20th centuries. Both are entirelymaterialist in their outlook and their disagreement is only over the manner inwhich the riches of the world are to be extracted and divided up. We can supposethat the very different concerns of Catharism, and its horror of materialentrapment, would have led during the course of history to very differentarrangements concerning ‘production’, the ownership of its ‘means’, and the usesand exploitation of the masses.Already in 12th century Occitania there is evidence that the Cathars had begunto meddle with the feudal economic order through programmes of adult educationand practical training for the poor and disenfranchised. For example workshopsrun by skilled perfecti were set up to provide apprenticeships in leather,paper-making and the textile trade.86[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en148] One of the objectives of theseworkshops was undoubtedly to turn out missionaries who could be self-sufficientas they wandered from town to town making conversions (as we noted earlier,surviving records show a particularly strong concentration in Cathar areas ofweavers and other workers in the textile trade). But the long-term effects ofsuch an education programme, leading as it did to the foundation of aninstructed artisan class, might have been literally revolutionary if it had beenallowed to continue. Little wonder, therefore, that the French philosopherVoltaire seized on the memory of the suppression of Catharism to rabble rouseagainst the evils of the Church and of feudal oppression of the masses.87[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en149] Initiated as a Freemason in 1778,as we saw in Chapter One, Voltaire's ideas were amongst the cocktail ofinfluences that precipitated the French Revolution in 1789.Pacifism was another central value in the ethical system of the perfecti and aresolute commitment to nonviolence was part of the regime of self-control overthe baser bodily instincts and desires that their initiation required of them.There are cases on record of perfecti who chose to be burned at the stake ratherthan satisfy the Inquisition that they were innocent of heresy by killing evenas lowly a creature as a hen.88 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en150]Yet surprisingly for people with such apparent contempt for their own lives –and for the pains of death – it has been observed that the perfecti:… retained an absolute respect for the fact of life itself; they would not allowany violent intervention by the human will (which they regarded as invariablyevil and arbitrary) in the fate of a soul pursuing its road to salvation.89[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en151]The same reasoning explains why the perfecti were utterly opposed to the use ofthe death penalty, even for capital offences. They also claimed that commoncriminals should not be punished but instead educated to become bettercitizens.90 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en152] Such avante gardedoctrines were of course denounced by the Church as scandalous.91[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en153]Equally controversial was the strident insistence of the Cathars – quitecontrary to the spirit of the times and the teachings of Catholicism – thatpreachers of crusade were ‘murderers’.92[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en154] Had the Cathars continued to winconverts at the rate they achieved in Occitania, instead of themselves beingstamped out (significantly by a crusade), what might the consequences have been?Isn't there every likelihood that they would have transformed the internationallandscape of the Middle Ages – again with incalculable but quite possibly verypositive consequences for the subsequent course of world history?FIGHTING BACKBut the world is the way it has been, not the way it might have been, and theCathars did not win. As we will see in Chapters Six and Seven, they losteverything – their lands, their culture, their freedom and their lives – in theblood-drenched horror of the Albigensian Crusades. Ravaging Occitania between1209 and 1244,93 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en155] these were 35years of virtually unremitting war – a brutal war of sieges and burnings andfearful massacres. Despite belonging to the ‘church of Love’, therefore, which‘did violence to no man’,94 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en156] thevery fact that a nation of vegetarian pacifists were able to resist the papalarmies for so long tells us that they did not simply lie down and surrender whenthey were attacked. They fought back – tooth and nail.This is by no means the only such paradox that Catharism offers. We've notedalready that its doctrinal horror of sex (as the productionline that deliversnew material incarnations for trapped souls to be reborn in) did not result in aconcomitant change in reproductive behaviour in Occitania during the Catharheyday. On the contrary Cathar families went on producing children in largenumbers and the region enjoyed rapid population growth. The solution to theapparent paradox lies in the very different standards of behaviour expected ofcredentes and perfecti. The former adhered to the beliefs of Catharism but werenot required to emulate the practices of its adepts.We've seen how this system left credentes free to marry, make babies and eatmeat as they chose. By the same token, despite its pacifism, it also left themfree to resist persecution, and to defend their country and their faith withforce of arms – even if doing so required them to commit acts of ‘violentintervention in the fate of other souls’. The perfecti themselves seem always tohave stood back from the fray, leaving the actual job of fighting the enemy tothe credentes. Still there is evidence, in the face of pitiless Catholicaggression and mounting atrocities against Cathars, that even the perfecti foundreason to qualify their philosophy of absolute pacifism and nonviolence. Sincethis world was the creation of the Evil God, and the material realm was fully inhis power, it followed that he could create beings of pure evil – demons whomerely looked like humans but had no souls – to destroy the Good Men and GoodWomen of the Cathar faith. To fight against such beings, who were numerous inthe crusading armies and amongst the inquisitors, was hardly a crime.95[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en157]THE ANCIENT ENEMYSo in defending themselves against the murderous assault of the AlbigensianCrusades, Cathars came to feel vindicated in their beliefs. The Catholic Churchwas the instrument of an Evil God who had created the material world as hispersonal fiefdom of suffering and horror, pain and misery. Now day by day inOccitania there was ever more compelling evidence for the accuracy of thisproposition: the massacres repeatedly unleashed upon the civilian population;the tortures and the informer culture devised by the Inquisition; the endlessholocaust of the Cathar faithful.The scale, ferocity and sheer thoroughness of the Crusades are of course ameasure of the threat that the Church perceived in Catharism. We already knewthat the military support given to the Cathars by the great lords of Occitaniahad triggered this perception of danger. But as we looked through theheresiological literature of the period, we could not fail to note thatsomething else, perhaps almost equally potent, seemed to have been at work atwell.For although the scale of the Church's response was new – indeed unprecedented –the Catholic authorities clearly recognised Catharism as an old and deadlyenemy. It was for this reason that they so often referred to the Cathars as‘Manichees’, a heresy over which Rome had supposedly triumphed centuries before.For their part, though they would never have identified themselves as‘Manichees’, the Cathars claimed that their religion had come down to them fromantiquity, ‘passed from Good Man to Good Man’. It was, they said, the true faiththat the Church had usurped in the early days of Christianity.Most medieval scholars today prefer to argue that Catharism was essentially anew phenomenon and very much the product of its times. But neither of theprotagonists in this affair, Catholics or Cathars, thought this was the case.They believed themselves to be caught up in the latest episode of an ancientstruggle of profound consequence for the future of mankind.In the next chapters, with due respect to the opinions of the experts, we willinvestigate the possibility that the protagonists could have been right."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEWHERE GOOD AND EVIL MEETThese are they who … fell from Paradise when Lucifer lured them thence, with thelying assurance that whereas God allowed them the good only, the Devil (beingfalse to the core) would let them enjoy both good and evil; and he promised togive them wives whom they would love dearly; and that they should have authorityover one another, and that some amongst them should be kings, or emperors, orcounts; and that they would learn to hunt birds with birds, and beasts withbeasts.Cathar Prayer 1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en158] Up till now we have been able to treat the problem of the Cathars as if theirheresy existed in isolation. Of course this was not the case. They posed amassive threat to the Church of Rome on the basis of their success in nearbyOccitania and northern Italy. But they were in fact part of a much larger heresythat threatened the entire Christian establishment in Europe – not only theRoman Catholics in the West but also the Orthodox Church of the East based inConstantinople (ancient Byzantium, known today as Istanbul).The Catholic/Orthodox schism had been developing for centuries and becameofficial in AD 1054. By that date the former bishops of Constantinople hadalready long been in the habit of calling themselves ecumenical patriarchs –literally ‘patriarchs of the entire inhabited world’.2[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en159] Since this seemed to challenge thepope's own claim to the top job it was a source of great mutual hostility.Nevertheless both churches were of one mind on the subject of heresy – which wasto be stamped out.3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en160] And just asRome faced the heresy of Catharism in the West in the 12th and 13th centuries,so too, and for rather longer, the patriarchate in Constantinople confronted theheresy known as Bogomilism in the East which began its period of expansion some200 years earlier and survived until the end of the 14th century.It was called ‘Bogomilism’ after its supposed founder whose name in Greek wasTheophilis and in Slav Bogomil – meaning ‘Beloved of God’.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en161] Active in Bulgaria in the firsthalf of the tenth century, this enigmatic individual preached a form of dualismthat was identical, in almost every detail, to the creed that would later beintroduced into Western Europe as Catharism. Hand in hand with these spiritualteachings, he is also remembered as the organiser of a political rebellion thatgave the persecuted Slav peoples a voice and incited them to withdraw theirlabour and fealty from their Graecized Bulgar overlords.5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en162]Although the Bogomil heresy endured in the East for three centuries longer thanWestern Catharism there is little reliable information about Bogomil himself.Not a single contemporary reference to him has come down to us and we knownothing about where or when he was born or died, who his teachers were, or howwidely he preached.6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en163] Theearliest-surviving report to mention him by name (although it is not theearliest to notice the heresy he started7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en164]) appears in a book written at somepoint between AD 977 and AD 990.8 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en165]The work of a hostile Christian monk named Cosmas, this tract tells us onlythat:In the days of the Orthodox Tsar Peter [AD 927 – 969] there lived … a priestcalled Bogomil (Loved of God), who in reality was not loved of God (Bogu ne mil), who was the first to sow heresy in the land of Bulgaria.9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en166]Though it supplies no more information about the man himself, Cosmas's book waswritten specifically to denounce the faith that Bogomil had founded. His purposewas to draw the attention of the Orthodox Church to the threat it faced, and toupbraid Church authorities for the lapses that had permitted such a heresy toflourish.10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en167]CLOSE TO THE SOURCES OF POWERIn the years following the death of Tsar Peter in AD 969 Bogomilism spreadrapidly westwards out of Bulgaria into the Balkan principalities of Serbia andBosnia (where it fared so well that it was frequently the official statereligion).11 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en168] Equally influentialin Croatia, Dalmatia and Macedonia, it also extended its grip into the heart ofthe great city of Constantinople itself,12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en169] headquarters of the OrthodoxChurch of the East. The first account of Bogomilism being practiced within thewalls of Constantinople dates from 1045. It is found in a letter written by themonk Euthymius of Periblepton – who even claimed to have discovered a heretical‘cell’ in his own monastery.13 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en170]Cosmas I (1075 – 81) was the first emperor of Constantinople to take sternaction against the Bogomils.14 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en171] Hissuccessor, Alexius I Comnenus (1081 – 1118) was even more vehement in hisattacks on the heresy. At an uncertain date between 1097 and 1104 he ordered thearrest of a known Bogomil named Diblatus who was tortured for information aboutkey figures in the movement. The trail led to Basil, a renegade monk fromMacedonia, now living under cover at a monastery in Constantinople, who was saidto have been a Bogomil evangelist for more than 40 years.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en172]Next Comnenus set a trap for Basil. Pretending only to know of him as arespected Orthodox monk, the emperor innocently asked for enlightenment aboutthe Christian faith. Human nature being what it is Basil could not pass up thisapparently golden opportunity and set out to try to convert Comnenus toBogomilism. A series of meetings followed in which the emperor thoroughlydebriefed the unfortunate Basil, getting him to reveal not only the centraldoctrines of the heresy but also compromising details of its organisation andmembership in Constantinople.16 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en173]Basil and his associates were then arrested and contemporary accounts tell usthat Comnenus reasoned in person with the Bogomils, trying to win them back tothe Orthodox faith. Those who recanted were pardoned and released. Those whowould not recant were imprisoned for life. Only Basil, on this occasion,suffered the extreme penalty – so much favoured by heresy hunters in the West –of being burnt to death. His stake was set up in Constantinople's Hippodrome forthe edification of a large crowd.17[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en174]Surviving records from Constantinople say nothing more about Bogomilism untilthe 1140s when there are reports of more heresy trials.18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en175] Then in 1145 we learn that no lessa figure than Cosmas Atticus, patriarch of the Orthodox Church, has fallen underthe spell of a certain Niphon, a Bogomil. When – horror of horrors – the hereticwas allowed to take up residence in the patriarchal palace other ecclesiasticsbegan to agitate against him. Eventually they took their complaints directly toEmperor Manuel I (himself later rumoured to have had covert ‘Bogomiltendencies’) and in 1147 Cosmas was deposed and Niphon arrested.19[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en176] Still the episode indicates thatby the mid-12th century, at about the time that Catharism was first detected inthe West, Bogomilism had grown from a minor cult started by an unknown priestinto a major religion that could position itself close to the sources of powerin the East.PAPA NICETASThis sense of a big faith on the move, taking shape, growing in confidence andbuilding up structure before our eyes, is heightened 20 years later in 1167. Inthat year, seemingly out of the blue, Nicetas, a senior Bogomil bishop fromConstantinople, suddenly turned up in the West. He arrived first in Lombardy innorthern Italy where he persuaded the local Cathar bishops to adopt importantdoctrinal changes and to be ‘reconsoled’ at his hands.20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en177] Then he moved on to the Languedoc.The entire Cathar administration of Occitania had gathered to await his presenceat the small town of Saint-Félix-de-Caraman near Toulouse. Under his guidanceroutine matters such as boundary disputes amongst the existing Cathar bishopricswere resolved and three new dioceses of Toulouse, Carcassonne and Agen wereestablished.21 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en178] As in Lombardy,however, the primary purpose of Nicetas’ visit seems to have been to urgeimportant doctrinal changes upon the Cathars and to reaffirm what were clearlyby this stage well-established links between the Cathar and Bogomil churches.22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en179] Indeed the immense respect shownto Nicetas, and the fact that he once again ‘reconsoled’ all the perfectipresent, tell us very clearly that the relationship between these two churcheswas that of a senior to a junior, or a father to a son. The Cathars of 1167, inother words, clearly regarded Bogomilism as the ‘home church’ to which they owedtheir allegiance.This conclusion is endorsed by modern historians who have amassed persuasiveevidence that the Catharism of the West was indeed a direct offshoot ofBogomilism.23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en180] Although northernItaly is closer to Constantinople the heresy seems to have been brought tonorthern France and even to Germany first (a report has survived of the trial ofa Cathar bishop in Cologne as early as 1143).24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en181] When it reached the Languedoc, andby what route, is not certain but it had clearly been present long enough by1167 for bishoprics to have been established and boundary disputes to havebroken out.It seems, however, that there must also have been some doctrinal lapse amongstthe Western Cathars which the doctrinal changes introduced by ‘Papa’ Nicetaswere designed to correct. These brought Catharism into line with his ownpowerful faction of the Bogomil church which believed in the absolute oppositionof the ‘two powers’ of Good and Evil.25[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en182] By contrast there were otherBogomils, and prior to 1167 many Cathars too, whose beliefs compromised thispristine polarity. These so-called mitigated dualists contemplated linkages, andeven family relationships, between the Good God and the God of Evil, somethingthat absolute dualists were not prepared to do.Another objective of Nicetas's visit was to organise further missionary activitythroughout Europe, using Occitania as a bridgehead. There is evidence thatdelegates left the 1167 Council of Saint-Félix invigorated and activelyanticipating the prospect.26 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en183]SOCIAL ENGINEERINGIn the decades after Nicetas at the close of the 12th century the Cathar andBogomil churches begin to look increasingly as though they are involved in awell-planned and coordinated plot.27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en184] The purpose of this plot could nothave been more revolutionary: to compete with and eventually to overthrow theChurch of Rome and the Orthodox Church of the East. The absurd worship of theEvil God who had made this world was to be undermined – not all at once butslowly, city by city, region by region. The true dualist religion of the Catharsand the Bogomils was to be introduced in its place. The fundamental aim of theproject was to free the souls of all mankind from the prison of matter and allowthem to return to the heavenly realm of the Good God who had made them. Sincethis would require an attitude towards material things radically different fromthe dominant interests of the times it was obvious that permanent changes in thestructure of society would also be necessary.For us as researchers, this issue was clarified when we discovered that theCathars in Occitania had involved themselves quite extensively in what wedescribed in the last chapter as ‘meddling with the feudal economic order’.It seemed unlikely to be a coincidence when we learned that the Bogomils didexactly the same thing. From the earliest references in 10th century they arelinked with social, economic and political upsets. ‘They teach their followersnot to obey their masters’, warned the monk Cosmas in his expose of theabominations of this seemingly new heresy:… they scorn the rich, they hate the Tsars, they ridicule their superiors, theyreproach the Boyars, they believe that God looks in horror on those who labourfor the Tsar, and advise every serf not to work for his master.28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en185]Confronted by material like this it is little wonder that many historians havejudged Bogomilism to be ‘at base … a social movement, directed against feudaloppression.’29 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en186] Others disagree andargue that we should ‘beware of attributing too much importance to the socialanarchism of the Bogomils or of seeing in them Slavonic communists of the MiddleAges.’30 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en187] In our opinion neitherview is quite correct. The Bogomils were not early communists – or any suchthing – since communism is a wholly materialist ethic concerned only with thematerial world. Neither were they ‘at base’ a social movement. Exactly likeCatharism, the evidence convinces us that the Bogomil religion was first andlast a spiritual movement, interested exclusively in the liberation of souls. Itwas the efficient pursuit of this spiritual objective, rather than any of thenormal characteristics of a ‘social movement’, that led the Bogomils inevitablytowards revolutionary behaviour in the material world. It inspired a criticalattitude towards earthly hierarchies and put a new mood of intelligentrebelliousness into the air.The same phenomenon of ‘social engineering’ running alongside dualist heresy wasobserved in other parts of Europe as well. In Occitania and France we showed inthe last chapter how the Cathars busied themselves in the education of a skilledartisan-class – notably weavers and others involved in the cloth and papertrades. In this way empowerment of the poor through skills-training wenthand-in-hand with the spread of the faith. We were therefore not surprised tolearn that researchers in Italy have unearthed proof of significant links therebetween Catharism and the trade of pursemaking. Like weaving, this was anoccupation that could provide suitable cover for missionary activities enablingCathar evangelists to travel incognito ‘making and selling their wares and atthe same time making heretical contacts.’31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en188]So, although the dualists professed to hate this world, such strategies showthat they did not hesitate to use rather worldly and ‘street-wise’ methods towin converts from the established Christian Churches. After travelling amongstthe Italian Cathars in the early 13th century Ivo of Narbonne reported that theyroutinely:… sent to Paris capable students from nearly all Lombard and some Tuscan cities.There some studied logic, others theology, with the aim of strengthening theirown error and overthrowing the Catholic faith.32[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en189]Such evidence of calculation and strategy seem less discordant with the Cathars’ethereal central purpose when we remember that they believed themselves to belocked in an elemental struggle – often literally to the death – for the soul ofman. If the Catholic Church were allowed to crush out the light of Catharismforever then the soul of man would likewise be lost forever. With the stakes sohigh and the enemy so diabolical, any means, fair or foul were reasonable tobring him down.SCHOOL OF HERESYFurther evidence that Cathars and Bogomils were involved not only in socialagitation but in a coordinated ‘plot’ to overthrow established Christianitycomes from study of the methods they used to win conversions. The fieldmissionaries of both sects appear to have followed the same procedures in thesame order so closely that it is obvious they must have shared the sametraining. In this, once again, we have the sense of confronting people who werenot in any way ethereal but, on the contrary, rather downto-earth, calculatingand strategic.They also demonstrated a good basic knowledge of psychology in ensuring that thecourse of instruction they gave as missionaries began with easily-acceptablegeneralities and moved on only very slowly to reveal the more deeply heretical –and thus conventionally shocking – aspects of their faith.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en190] Euthymius Zigabenus, whointerrogated the monk Basil in Constantinople while he was awaiting hisexecution in the Hippodrome, was told that the Bogomils began by instructingtheir followers in those beliefs and practices which they shared with theOrthodox:… preserving the fouler doctrines for later, and entrusting them to the moreinitiated in impiety as mysteries.34[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en191]The objective, in other words, was to detach potential converts as far aspossible from the beliefs they had been raised in before attempting tosubstitute the alternative dualist system.Another technique used by both Bogomil and Cathar preachers was to capitalise onthe common-sense scepticism of ordinary people to demystify elaborate Churchrituals – and therefore, by association, the whole religious edifice that laybehind them. The Mass was a favourite target of the Cathars who askedchurchgoers to think very carefully and objectively about each of its details.When they partook of the wafer and the wine of Holy Communion, for instance, howcould they possibly imagine – as Catholic priests had taught them – that theywere consuming the actual body and blood of Christ? Wasn't this contrary toreason, if not just plain stupid? All the Catholics that had ever existed hadbeen performing the Mass and guzzling the Holy Communion for hundreds andhundreds of years. If what they had been consuming were really the physical bodyand blood of Christ then he must have been absolutely enormous – at least thesize of a mountain, with veins like rivers – which clearly had not been thecase. Moreover, coming at the problem from a different direction, Catharevangelists would frequently add an unpleasant reminder about digestiveprocesses and their end products. Did decent people who loved God really want topass his body and blood through their intestines?35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en192] What kind of religion was it thatwould require them to participate in such bizarre and frankly cannibalisticpractices? So logic, reason and good taste were all against the Church beingright about this basic issue long before the time came to introduce more‘touchy’ Cathar doctrines like the non-physical nature of Christ.The next step in the conversion process was often for the missionary to provideconcrete examples of how far the Church had strayed from the true path. Favouredobject lessons were the notorious sins of the clergy and their extravagantlifestyles. These were then graphically compared to the simple, decent,unostentatious lives advocated in the New Testament for Christians. Aftercontemplating the glaring contradictions thus revealed, most rightthinkingcitizens in the audience would have needed little further convincing that therewas something rotten in the heart of the Church.In a similar way, further still down the road of conversion, the method forintroducing the dualist doctrine of the evil nature of material creation was toillustrate it with numerous practical examples that anyone could easily grasp.Earthquakes might be cited, or volcanic eruptions, or lightning strikes, orsnakes, along with many of the other noxious evils that we all know do stalk thematerial world.36 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en193] As before, NewTestament texts would be extensively quoted, this time to show that the trueteachings of Christ and his apostles endorsed the dualist rejection of materialthings.37 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en194]Malcolm Lambert, a modern scholar with decidedly pro-Catholic sympathies, claimsthat the heretics usually achieved these effects by dishonest manipulation ofthe relevant passages which were ‘wrenched out of context’ to reinforce thedualist message.38 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en195] The end result,most efficacious in winning conversions, was that the typical unsophisticatedaudience for a dualist sermon would be convinced that they had received ‘anexhortation by good men based on the words of the founder of Christianity and ofhis followers.’39 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en196]It is little wonder, therefore, that for a long while the Cathars and theBogomils enjoyed enormous success in their respective spheres of influence. Bythe end of the 12th century they had together created what Sir Steven Runcimandescribes as ‘one great confederate Dualist Church … stretching from the BlackSea to Biscay.’40 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en197] At its core weresixteen bishoprics positioned in areas of influence and high population all theway from Constantinople in the East to Toulouse in the West.41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en198] Since the heretics had, from thebeginning, commanded great influence in the countryside as well as in the cities– and had generally worked from the bottom of society up in their programme ofconversions – they entered the 13th century occupying an astonishingly strongposition in Europe. Not even 250 years had passed since Bogomil himself hadfirst appeared in Bulgaria to preach the doctrine of the Good and the Evil God.Yet in that short time an international infrastructure had been laid down andenough popular support won for medieval dualism to begin to think of itself asan established religion and to proclaim its own ‘universality and supra-nationalunity’42 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en199] over and against that ofthe established Church.THE PORTRAIT OF DORIAN GRAYAccepting as all scholars do that Bogomilism was simply ‘Bulgarian Catharism’,43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en200] or, more accurately, that‘Catharism was in origin a Western form of Bogomilism’,44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en201] what were the most importantbeliefs at the core of this heretical, pan-European religion?We've seen that a belief in duality was fundamental – that is to say, a beliefin two Gods, one Good, one Evil, with the latter depicted as the creator of theearth, of mankind, and of all material things. This in turn led the dualists tothe conclusion that Christ, as an emanation of the Good God, could not haveexisted ‘in the flesh’ – which was by definition evil. Likewise he could neitherhave been born nor crucified (both of which call for a physical body) – andtherefore could not have redeemed our sins by dying on the cross.The reader is also familiar with the notion, again shared in full by theBogomils and the Cathars, that the Holy Spirit had been brought to earth by thenon-physical Christ and transmitted ever since – ‘from Good Man to Good Man’ –through the ritual of the consolamentum and the laying-on of hands. In bothbranches of the religion the ritual was the same and in both it served as aninstrument of initiation at which a sacred gnosis was acquired that raised thecandidate from the class of the neophytes to the class of adepts.45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en202]Such beliefs and behaviour, on their own, clearly delineate key differencesbetween mainstream Christianity on the one hand and the Bogomil/Cathar religionon the other. But there are many more – as might be expected given the genuinelyGnostic and essentially non-authoritarian character of the heresy. Like allearlier forms and expressions of Gnosticism it honoured the power of individualrevelation over and above established doctrine. The result, part of the life ofthe religion, was a luxuriant jungle of speculation by both Cathars and Bogomilsaround their key concerns. These were the origins of evil, the essentialgoodness and immortality of souls, and the cause of their repeated incarnationsin human bodies here on wicked planet Earth. It was the encouragement given tosuch individual creativity and freedom of expression that led to the principalschism in the heretical Church – that between so-called absolute and moderatedualists, which in turn proliferated into numerous smaller subdivisions. Theseseem to have competed for conversions – ‘although they may have differing andcontrary opinions’46 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en203] – but theyalso apparently recognised one another and co-existed in a spirit of mutualtolerance.47 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en204]Despite the state of intellectual anarchy that prevailed amongst the heretics wethought it was possible to make out certain fundamentals of their religion onwhich all or most seem to have agreed. When we compared these with thefundamentals of established Christianity it was difficult to avoid the eeriefeeling that each was a weirdly distorted reflection of the other. Like DorianGray and his portrait in the attic they were the same but opposites, near butvery far apart.THE JOURNEY OF THE SOULOne matter of great common interest and wildly dissimilar treatment was theorigin and ultimate fate of the soul and its relationship to the human body.Established Christian teaching is extremely clear:Each individual soul is a new creation of God, infused into the body destinedfor it.48 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en205]At death the soul is separated from the body, though not permanently as the twowill be reunited at the Second Coming of Christ and the resurrection of thedead. Then:… departed souls will be restored to a bodily life and the saved will enter inthis renewed form upon the life of heaven.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en206]Said to be a ‘fundamental element’ of Christian doctrine it was a dominant viewamongst medieval theologians that:… the resurrection will involve a collection and revivifying of the particles ofthe dead body.50 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en207]Naturally the Cathars and Bogomils did not believe in the resurrection of thebody. They regarded it as a truly impractical and actually rather hideous idea.Their interest was exclusively in the soul which they saw as an immortalnon-physical intelligence that entered the human body at conception andthereafter wore it like a ‘tunic’51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en208] until the body died. They picturedthe soul as a time traveller on an immense journey towards perfection. Ratherthan the one-off ‘resurrection’ of billions of mouldering corpses on JudgementDay, their view was that each soul would be reborn many times on earth, in manydifferent bodies – both human and animal52[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en209] – before attaining its goal. Verymuch as in Buddhism, the objective was to progress to the advanced state ofdetachment, purity and self-control, obtainable only in human form,53[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en210] that was believed necessary torelease the soul forever from its imprisonment in the world of matter. The pricewas a life, perhaps many lifetimes, of severe asceticism and meditation.Moreover, though austerities were regarded as absolutely necessary, the readerwill recall that they were not on their own held to be sufficient to obtain thesoul's release. For that was also required the power of the Holy Spirittransmitted through the laying on of hands in the consolamentum.So, in the dualist scheme of things, the destiny of the soul after deathdepended on what it had done with its period of physical incarnation justcompleted:• If, through efforts made in this and previous lives, it had been born in thebody of a man or a woman who would become a Cathar or Bogomil perfectus, and ifthe perfectus concerned died in a fully-consoled state without having lapsed,then the soul's term of imprisonment on earth would end. Released from thesnares of matter it could rise back at last to its true home in the furthest andhighest heaven – the realm of pure spirit ruled by the God of Good.• If on the other hand the soul had incarnated in a body that did not have theopportunity to encounter Cathar or Bogomil teachings – and thus to be consoled –then it would born again in yet another body, and another, and another, until itdid, finally, come to ‘the understanding of God.’54[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en211]A doctrine of karma is not explicitly spelled out in the fragments of thedualist teachings that have come down to us. Still it is clear that goodness andpersonal austerity were thought to be beneficial to the progress of the soulwhile a lifetime of wickedness and self-indulgence would have profoundlynegative consequences. Punishments of a ‘karmic’ nature could take the form ofrebirth in particularly ghastly circumstances, or as an idiot, or even as a dumbanimal – which, since it could not speak or reason, would only further frustratethe progress of the soul caged within it.55[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en212]JEHOVAH (AKA THE DEVIL) AND THE OLD TESTAMENTFor Cathars and Bogomils the earth, and all material things in the perceptibleuniverse, were the work of the Evil God. And while they worshipped the God ofGood they acknowledged that he existed in an entirely separate dimension and hadno direct influence in the Devil's playground.By way of stark contrast, Christians believe in only one God, depicted asomnipotent and universally good, who created the material world and with it thehuman body and soul. He also established a spiritual heaven somewhere ‘above’and outside the material dimension. There the souls of his elect, restored totheir bodies, are to be sent on the Day of Judgement while for the remainder ofmankind – sinners all – it is well known that God has prepared a suitable hell.For mainstream Christians the books of the Old Testament, just like those of theNew Testament, are regarded as inspired texts that form an integral part oftheir canonical scriptures.56 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en213] Muchis made of the continuity between the old ‘Law’, shared with the synagogue, andthe new Law brought by Jesus. Likewise when Roman Catholics or OrthodoxChristians speak of God as the ‘Father’ and Jesus as the ‘Son’ they clearlyunderstand the ‘Father’ to be none other than Yahweh (Jehovah), the God of theOld Testament. Nothing compels us to believe that he has become some completelydifferent or even radically transformed deity. Jesus brings a ‘New Covenant’,certainly, but you don't have to read the small print to realise that the GodChristians go to church to worship today is still Jehovah.The heretics adopted the same general scenario but their take on it wasradically different. Far from being the object of their worship, Jehovah forthem was synonymous with the ‘Devil’, or ‘Satan’, or ‘Lucifer’ – just another ofthe many names by which the Evil God who had made the material world was known.They judged him by his deeds which were well known and had always beenarbitrary, vengeful, violent and cruel. The Old Testament, in describing thesedeeds, was simply an extended paean to Jehovah's unmitigated wickedness and wasseen by the Cathars and the Bogomils as an irredeemably evil text – evil throughand through – that had been written to flatter this evil deity. To adopt it asscripture, as the established Christians had done, was to capitulate entirely tothe Devil. They therefore exorcised the Old Testament from their lives and wouldaccept no argument based on its authority.57[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en214] They relied instead upon the NewTestament, and in some extreme cases on just a few specific books within the NewTestament.To this extent, though they were not Christians, theirs was a new Testamentreligion. However they also reverenced several other texts, as we shall seelater, that were neither known nor accepted by the mainstream Church.THE CREATURE OF MUD AND THE HOLE IN HEAVENIf the basic dualist perception is of the separation and completeincompatibility of the realms of spirit and matter then how is it possible thatsouls – though wholly spiritual and the creation of the Good God – could haveended up imprisoned in human bodies created by the Evil God?Cathar and Bogomil missionaries had a varied collection of myths at theirdisposal to help confront such paradoxes and answer questions arising from themin graphic and engaging ways.58 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en215]The myths weren't ‘dogmas’ or even ‘doctrines’ and it would be foolish to thinkthat they were taken literally. Rather they were storyboards used as teachingdevices – the point being for different teachers to bring different listeners indifferent circumstances to their own independent understanding of the mystery.In brief, what the dualist myths tell us is that the paradoxical mixing of goodand evil in the heart of the human creature came about after the EvilGod/Jehovah/Satan had created the material earth as described in the OldTestament. Some of the myths state that he was not satisfied with thisachievement so he attempted to create a man, moulding the body out of mud orclay, like a potter.59 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en216] But try ashe might he was unable to breathe the spirit of life into the body he had made –for the spirit of life is in the gift of the Good God alone. In desperationtherefore:He sent an embassy to the Good Father, and asked Him to send His breath, sayingthat the man would be shared if he were to be endowed with life … Because God isgood, He agreed and breathed into what [Jehovah/Satan] had moulded the breath oflife; immediately man became a living soul, splendid in his body and bright withmany graces.60 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en217]A quaint sidelight comes from a vernacular form of the myth, repeated to theInquisition in Toulouse in 1247. A witness reported having been told by a Catharhow the Devil made the body of the first man, Adam, and God gave it a soul. Butthen:The man leaped up and said to the Devil, ‘I do not belong to you’.61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en218]So we are to envisage an independent-minded creature here, one who is aware ofthe good within himself and capable of subduing the evil material inclinationsof his body. The natural impulse of this ‘Living Soul’ is to return to the realmof the Good God yet it cannot do so without purification because it has now beenthoroughly contaminated by matter. Worse, far from sharing Adam, as he hadpromised, it is the intention of the Evil God to monopolise the man, drawing himever deeper into the realm of this world and causing him to forget his spiritualorigins. Eve is suddenly (sometimes confusingly) on the scene, also a ‘LivingSoul’, and she and Adam are impelled by the Devil:… towards that carnal union that finally consummated their position as creaturesof matter.62 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en219]The original gift of Spirit breathed by God into the parents nevertheless istransmitted through the act of reproduction to their descendants, and theirsouls, now enchained to matter, are reborn again and again on the Devil's earth.Another myth tells a different story to make essentially the same points. Inthis case the Evil God starts out not so much as a completely separate principlebut as an emanation from the Good God – a heavenly being of the type that wemight think of as an angel. Like Satan in Christian cosmology his pride,arrogance and avarice corrupt him and he must leave the good heaven. In themomentum of his Fall he draws down with him:… a great crowd of souls who had been created by God and were living close tohim in a state of beatitude. It was from this inexhaustible reserve of fallen orcaptive angels that human souls derived.63[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en220]In other recensions the God of Good and the God of Evil may be portrayed asequal and opposite powers, or the latter may again be a fallen emanation of theformer. Having created the material world, the God of Evil lures a host ofangels out of heaven. This he does by promising them:… possessions, gold, silver and wives, till they fell like rain upon the earthfor nine days and nights to be shut up in bodies by Satan.64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en221]Many accounts say that a third of all the angels in heaven,65[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en222] due to their own ‘weaknesses’,were thus tempted to descend to earth to animate the zombie bodies that the Godof Evil had prepared for them. Meanwhile the God of Good notices the radicaldecline in the angel population and discovers that the departure of so many hasripped a hole in heaven. He prevents further losses by jamming his foot in thehole and tells those who have already fallen that they will remain on earth,encased in bodies ‘for the moment and for now.’66[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en223] Through the cycle ofreincarnation, harnessed to the sex impulse that ensures an endless supply ofnew bodies to replace those that wear out, the Devil believes that he hasimprisoned the fallen angels in the human race forever. But the enigmatic words‘for the moment and for now’ lead us to understand that the God of Good has aplan that will frustrate the Devil and restore the lost souls to heaven.67[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en224]CHRIST'S HOLOGRAPHIC MISSION TO THE REALM OF AN ALIEN GODSince the dualist perspective makes the God of Good powerful only in thespiritual realm, and the God of Evil powerful only in the material realm, itdoes not easily provide a mechanism for either to operate on the other's hometurf. Perhaps this is why it takes a very long time – thousands of years we'retold, in all the Cathar and Bogomil cosmologies68[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en225] – for the Good God to implementhis plan to frustrate the Devil.It is a plan conceived out of compassion for the imprisoned souls of the angelichost – because their life on earth, isolated from the Holy Spirit that hadfilled them before their fall, is one of ‘unimaginable suffering’.69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en226] Denied the radiance of the Spirit,and all that is good, they are trapped far from their true home in a dimensionto which they do not belong. A Cathar prayer expresses their grief:We are not of this world, and this world is not of us, and we fear lest we meetdeath in this realm of an alien God.70[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en227]The prayer goes right to the heart of the problem. How is the God of Good toproject his spiritual power into the material realm of the God of Evil in orderto rescue the souls trapped there?The dualists all gave the same answer to this question – Jesus Christ. But theirChrist was a very different figure from Jesus the ‘Son of God’, born a man,later crucified and resurrected from the dead, who is worshipped by RomanCatholics and Orthodox Christians. The reader will recall that the Cathars andBogomils believed Christ to have been non-human – an emanation from the Good Godwho could never have been ‘born’ into evil flesh but who had manifested in ourmaterial dimension as a particularly convincing yet ‘non-physical’ apparition.Indeed it might even be helpful in explaining what the dualists had in mind hereto say that their Christ figure was a sort of avatar – not a created, materialbeing, but an emission or radiation or instrument of the Good ‘sent forth todeal with the created world.’71 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en228]Christ's mission was threefold.First he was to preach a religion, and transmit a gnosis, that would lift thescales from the eyes of mankind and provide high initiates with insight into themeaning of death, the true character of existence and the fate of the soul.Secondly, he was to offer instruction as to how humans might best live togetherthrough their vast cycle of incarnations in the hell called the earth. In thelong-term project of cleansing souls contaminated by matter and preparing themto return to heaven there was no doubt that certain social arrangements andpersonal commitments were more conducive to the success of the ‘mission’ thanothers. For example if humanity could be persuaded to organise itself accordingto principles of love, nonviolence, kindness, frugality, tolerance and mercythen this would obviously be better for all concerned than hate, bloodshed,cruelty, excess, dogmatism and vengeance. Since the God of Evil sought everyopportunity to urge us on to all of the latter – and to every other ugly andwicked impulse of which we are capable – the purpose of the teachings of Jesuswas to provide a counter-balance. Though in fact he was a phantasm, the perfect‘life’ that he would appear to live on earth would also serve as an example toshow others the way.The third and by far the most important objective of Christ's holographicmission was to bring down with him from heaven a blazing fragment of the HolySpirit. For those souls who succeeded in purifying and perfecting themselves onearth it would provide the final necessary burst of sacred energy that wouldbreak the bonds of matter and return them to heaven.72[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en229] We might envisage it as a flamingtorch, lit from the main fire of the Spirit in heaven and now able to transmitits revivifying flame to souls marooned in the material world below.Before his feigned death upon the cross, the Cathars and the Bogomils believedthat Jesus had passed custody of this spiritual flame to the apostles throughthe laying on hands – the original ritual of the consolamentum – and thence tothe primitive church.A SHORT EXCURSION TO PARALLEL WORLDSFor some years our own long-term research interest has been in religious systemsthat give special emphasis to the dualisms of ‘heaven-earth’, ‘sky-ground’ and‘above-below’. We have argued in previous books that such systems were onceprominent in the ancient world – most notably amongst the Egyptians.73[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en230] There are, for instance, funerarytexts 3500 years old (and older examples of the same type of material could becited) that instruct the pharaoh to make a copy on the ground, and gainknowledge – gnosis – of a region of the sky called ‘the hidden circle of theDuat’.74 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en231] He is to do this so thathe may become a ‘spirit’ after death and be:… well-equipped both in heaven and earth, unfailingly and regularly andeternally.75 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en232]The source of this passage is the 11th division of the Book of What is in theDuat (written on the walls of the tomb of Thutmosis III, 1479 – 1425 BC). Alittle later in the same text – in the 12th division – the pharaoh is instructedfor a second time to make a copy on the ground of the hidden circle of the Duatso that it may:… act as a magical protector for him, both in heaven and upon earth.76[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en233]We have argued that such dualistic sky-ground thinking was a key element in thereligion of ancient Egypt for at least 3,000 years from the beginning of the OldKingdom to the time of Christ. And we've tried to show how that religioninspired the pharaohs to undertake great construction projects – the Pyramids ofGiza, for example, or the Temples of Karnak and Luxor – which in a variety ofdifferent ways sought to ‘copy’ or ‘reconstitute’ the perfection of the heavensin the land of Egypt.77 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en234]We were therefore intrigued to discover that surviving texts, traditions andinquisitional records from Occitania, Italy and Constantinople contain not onlycopious illustrations of the well-understood ‘spirit-matter’, ‘goodevil’ dualismpracticed by the Cathars and the Bogomils but also rarer examples of adistinctly ‘ancient Egyptian’ heaven-earth dualism.For example, when Euthymius Zigabenus interrogated the Bogomil evangelist Basilin Constantinople around the year 1100 he was told one of the versions of the‘fallen angel myths’ often used to explain how souls created by the God of Goodhad come to be in bodies created by the God of Evil. In this variant both Satanand Jesus are ‘Sons’ – emanations – of the Good God. Satan, the elder ‘Son’covets the father's kingdom and rebels against him. The rebellion fails andSatan is expelled from heaven. Yet through pride and envy he still yearns topossess a realm where he might be God. He therefore creates the earth and ‘asecond heaven’ (our emphasis), moulds his zombie humans from mud and water andpersuades the Good God to breathe souls into them.78[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en235] The reader knows the rest of thestory.Another hint of the same kind of thinking comes in reports, collected by theInquisition, of Cathar teachings concerning ‘the truth of the Upper and LowerWorlds’.79 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en236] Here we read about theGod of Good ‘preaching in the sky to his people’, and how he sent Satan down to‘this world’ and how afterwards Satan desired:… to have a part of the Lower and Upper possessions, and the Lord did not wishit, and on this account there was war for a long time.80[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en237] Striking and colourful reference was also made to a Cathar teaching that: Oxen … grazed and ploughed the soil and worked on the sky as on the earth.81[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en238]Rather than outlining actual ‘beliefs’ it seems to us that such teachings arebest understood as simplified illustrations or mental images to assist neophytesin the analysis of difficult concepts. Embedded in all of them is thefundamental dualist idea of two parallel worlds, one all spirit, one all matter,but here visualised in terms of graphic sky-ground metaphors. It was in the samevein that the Cathars would often speak of the ‘earthly earth’ and the ‘heavenlyearth’82 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en239] – the former being ourplanet, this underworld or hell-world on which human incarnations are servedout; the latter to be understood as a parallel celestial or heavenly realm.83[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en240]There was a text that was held in the highest regard by the heretics. Known asthe Vision of Isaiah it reached the Cathars in the late 12th century from theBogomils, being translated in the process from Greek or Old Slavonic into Latin.However it is believed by scholars to have ‘deep roots in the past, probablyfinding its origins among the Greek Gnostics towards the end of the firstcentury AD.’84 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en241] In it we read howIsaiah (a prophet generally exempted by the dualists, for reasons that need notdetain us here, from their general hatred of the Old Testament) is given a greatprivilege by the God of Good. He sends an angel from heaven to take the prophetby the hand and lead him on a journey through both the earthly and the celestialrealms, crossing the barrier between the two – something that ‘no one whodesires to return to the flesh’ has ever before been permitted to do. As theyascend through the heavens they see tremendous battles raging on all sidesbetween the emanations of the God of Evil and the emanations of the God of Good:For just as it is on earth, so also it is in the firmament, because replicas ofwhat are in the firmament are on earth.85[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en242]Rainier Sacconi, a relapsed Cathar perfectus who turned inquisitor in themid-12th century, reported significant discussion of such ideas amongst hisformer co-religionists. They believed, he said, that certain of their sacredbooks had been written in heaven and brought down to earth (our emphasis) byChrist who entrusted them to the primitive church on the completion of hismission.86 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en243]It was to this primitive church, ‘which alone could offer true consolation tothe souls dwelling in exile,’87 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en244]that the dualists claimed to belong. Through an unbroken chain of consolations,they said, their perfecti had preserved and passed down the flame of the HolySpirit undimmed from the time of Christ. The only problem was that they had beenforced to preserve it in secret because the God of Evil, absolute master of thisworld, had substituted a false Church for the true Church one century before andendowed it with immense material power. This imposter Church masqueraded as‘Christian’ but actually served the Devil.88[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en245] By working for its downfall,therefore, the Bogomils and Cathars claimed that they only sought to restore thestatus quo ante that had prevailed at the time of the apostles.ANCIENT LEGACY OR MEDIEVAL INVENTION?It sounds like blatant propaganda. Of course heretics would like us to believethat only their Church was the authentic descendant of the church of theapostles. Even if they'd only invented themselves yesterday, why settle foranything less? Surprisingly, however, several leading scholars in this field areconvinced that such claims are solidly based and that the Cathar and BogomilChurches somehow did manage to preserve genuine traditions from the earliestdays of Christianity.The pro-Catholic scholar Martin Lambert doesn't want to make too much of it whenhe admits that.By a strange chance the rite of the consolamentum that appears in the 13thcentury texts does seem to have been based on a rite for baptism and onpractices connected with the catechumenate [those who were candidates forbaptism] much earlier than the contemporary Catholic rites of baptism orordination.89 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en246]But Steven Runciman points out that this is by no means the only closeresemblance. In his view, whether we think them ‘strange’ or not, there are fartoo many similarities for us to put them all down to ‘chance’:The Ritual Feast of the Cathars [which involved a simple breaking-ofbreadceremony] is, if we equate the Perfect with the Early Christian priest, exactlythe same as the Early Christian Communion Feast. The Kiss of Peace terminatedEarly Christian services as it did those of the Cathars … The consolamentum inits two aspects was closely akin to the adult baptism administered by the EarlyChurch to the dying and to the ordination or initiation into its ministry. Thevery details of the service are similar. In the Early Church [as was the casewith a prospective Cathar perfectus] the catechumen was tested by a long andstern probationary period [prior to] his initiation ceremony … The actualordination was identical, consisting of the laying on of hands and of the Gospelupon the catechumen's head …90 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en247] …While polemical churchmen in the Middle Ages denounced the heretics formaintaining a class of the Elect or Perfect they were denouncing an EarlyChristian practice, and the heretic initiation ceremony that they viewed with somuch horror was almost word for word the ceremony with which Early Christianswere admitted to the Church.91 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en248] Such similarity cannot be fortuitous. Obviously the Cathar Church had preserved,only slightly amended to suit its doctrines of the time, the services extant inthe Christian Church during the first four centuries of its life.92[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en249]Runciman notes that everywhere they went – whether it was amongst the oppressedSlav peasants of Bulgaria or amongst the free-thinking burghers of Occitania –the heretics were able to exploit pre-existing social and economic conditions inorder to gain a foothold. But, he concludes, ‘the political impulse was noteverything’:Behind it there was a steady spiritual teaching, a definite religion, thatdeveloped and declined as most religions do, but that embodied a constanttradition.93 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en250]It is his view that this tradition is in one sense as old as human speculationabout the nature of evil in the world – dating back, long before Christianity,to whatever prehistoric age it was when men first asked ‘why God, if there be aGod, could permit it?’94 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en251] Fromthere Runciman is willing to trace the same primordial religion very tentativelyinto the historical period, seeing elements of it drawn together from ‘Egyptian,Zoroastrian and even Buddhist ideas.’95[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en252] Three centuries after Christ itwas likewise notable how:Stoics and Neoplatonists each in their own way condemned the world of matter;and Jewish thinkers of Alexandria began to face the problem [of evil],influenced by the emphasis on spirit that they found in the Hermetic lore ofEgypt.96 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en253]Runciman concludes that it was the Gnostics of Alexandria and Syria who wereresponsible – roughly between the first and fourth centuries AD – for finallygathering together all such lines of thought and applying them toChristianity.97 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en254] Thereafter aseries of overlapping heresies could be sketchily made out in the historicalrecord. It was these together, Runciman argues, that had preserved the ‘constanttradition’ from the early Gnostic schools, by way of Manicheism between thethird and sixth centuries AD, to reach eventually the Bogomils in the tenthcentury. They in their turn transmitted it to Western Europe in the form ofCatharism in the 12th century.Hans Soderberg is a second major authority in this field who is satisfied thatthe religious beliefs and practices of the medieval dualists were connected by‘an uninterrupted traditional chain’ to the Gnostic religions that hadflourished a thousand years earlier.98[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en255] He believes, moreover, that theCathars merely gave ‘a Christian clothing’ to the even more ancient, indeedvirtually universal, myth ‘of the combat between the two powers.’99[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en256]But other historians are not at all happy about tracing the origins of medievaldualism so far back.100 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en257] MalcolmLambert thus speaks for many when he tries to place the whole Cathar/Bogomilphenomenon firmly in the context of its times, seeing it primarily as a reactionto specific economic, political and social circumstances. Even he, however, isprepared to admit that Bulgaria (converted to Orthodox Christianity barely acentury before the pop Bogomil began teaching) may have provided uncommonly goodground for the heresy because of the possible influence of ‘pre-existing dualistbeliefs in the country.’101 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en258]LISTENING TO HERETICS AND HERESY HUNTERSWhatever the personal stance of individual scholars may be on the problem oforigins, we've observed a curious phenomenon in reviewing the literature. Veryfew of the attempts made to trace the history of ideas behind medieval dualism(whether they support or contradict the idea of an ancient tradition) have beenwilling to pay serious attention to what the dualists themselves – or theiropponents in the Church – had to say on the matter.For example when heresy hunters in Western Europe referred to the Cathars as‘Manichees’ it is automatically assumed that they must have been mistakenbecause Manicheism had been suppressed centuries previously.In the East, Theophylact, patriarch of Constantinople from AD 933 – 956, was oneof the first to warn of the stirrings of the heresy that soon become known asBogomilism (although he did not know of Bogomil by name). Writing to Tsar Peterof Bulgaria he was just as quick as his counterparts in the West to link theheresy to Manicheism (and also to the pre-existing dualist religion known asPaulicianism, of which we shall hear more in the next chapter). ‘Let the leadersand teachers of this ancient heresy which has newly reappeared be anathema,’102[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en259] he pronounced firmly at the end ofhis letter. Yet scholars are reluctant to pursue the possibility that the heresythus anathematised could have been anywhere near as ‘ancient’ as Theophylactclearly believed.The same academic scepticism also inhibits research into the implications of theheretics’ own statements about their origins – all of which have come down to usthrough the work of the heresy hunters and thus seethe with hostile comments andinterpretations. As early as 1143 or 1144 for example, when Catharism was firstbeginning to be recognised in Western Europe, the monk Everwin of Steinfeld(near Cologne in Germany) wrote a worried letter to Bernard of Clairvauxappealing for his assistance in the struggle against the heretics:… who everywhere in almost all churches boil up from the pit of hell as thoughalready their prince were about to be loosed and the day of the Lord were athand.103 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en260]Everwin frankly observed that the heresy was gaining ground because of theapparent piety of its missionaries who possessed:… no house, or lands, or anything of their own, even as Christ had no propertynor allowed his disciples the right of possession.104[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en261]Equally potent, and apparently extremely convincing, was the heretics’insistence that theirs was Christ's original Church – the primitive churchitself, reawakened after being forced to lie low ‘in Greece and certain otherlands … from the time of the martyrs … ’105[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en262] Though Evil powers had made everyeffort to destroy the church of the Good God:We and our fathers of apostolic descent, have continued in the grace of Christand shall so remain until the end of time.106[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en263]Martin Lambert's comment is that one of the reasons the Cathar perfecti were soconvincing was because they:… honestly thought that they were the only true Christians, that the clergy werethe servants of Satan's Church; and that Cathar teaching presented a stream ofpure underground Christianity, often persecuted, but always surviving andreaching back to the days of the apostles.107[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en264]Whether they were right or not is another matter, but we know what the hereticsbelieved. They believed that their faith was meant to guide the world. This waswhat was destined. This had been the plan of the Good God to fetch the lostsouls back to heaven and he had sent Christ to earth to set it in motion.All had proceeded as it should until the reign of Emperor Constantine in thefourth century. Then, at the very moment when Christianity triumphed overmultiple competitors to become the state religion of the Roman Empire, the Devilpulled off his most cunning trick. A clique within the Church that insisted onliteral interpretation of the scriptures – rather than the more allegoricalapproach favoured by Gnostic Christians – seized control and rapidly began topersecute as heretics all those who disagreed with them. Under interrogation theBogomil evangelist Basil explicitly mentioned the church father John Chrysostom(AD 347 – 407), who is indeed known for his ‘literalist’ views,108[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en265] as a ringleader of this clique ofearly heresy hunters.109 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en266]It was such purges between the fourth and sixth centuries AD, said the Catharsand the Bogomils, that had forced their true Church underground. Only now, afterthe sleep of years, was it was emerging once more from the shadows. In the 10thcentury it had seemed no more than the rantings of a lone vegetarian inBulgaria. By the 11th century it had become a cult that had spread throughoutthe Balkans and to Constantinople. By the mid-12th century it was firmlyestablished in Italy and Occitania and could also claim to have won manyfollowers elsewhere ‘scattered throughout the world’.110[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en267]Though the scholars have paid scant attention, it seemed to us that what theheretics were claiming was dynamite – not only that their forefathers in thedualist Church were the true descendants of the apostles but also that anancient conspiracy had denied them their rightful role in shaping the destiny ofthe West. Perhaps even more explosive was the way they clearly saw themselves aspart of a long-delayed ‘counter-conspiracy’ that had begun in the last 50 yearsof the first millennium and that had grown steadily, one might almost sayremorselessly, in the two centuries that followed.As we continued to explore the strange phenomenon of medieval heresy we couldnot shake off the feeling that something ancient and hidden, with a profoundpurpose for mankind, had briefly shown its face a thousand years ago, tried tochange the world, and failed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURCHAIN OF THE GREAT HERESYIn its Manichean form Gnosticism was once a real worldwide religion,i.e. a worldwide and separate Gnostic community or church (ekklesia)with its many thousands and, later on, even millions of adherents; itsown leader, bishops and priests; its own canonical scriptures; and evenits own very attractive art. Once Manichaeism spread from southernMesopotamia as far as the Atlantic in the West and the Pacific in the FarEast. It had its adherents in Egypt, in Roman North Africa, in Spain, Gaul,Italy and the Balkans, and in the end even in the regions on the SouthChina Coast. Its history covers the period from the beginning of thethird century to modern times. Even in our century [i.e. the 20th century]Manichaeism was still forbidden by law in Vietnam.Johannes Van Oort, Lecturer in the History of Christianity at the UtrechtUniversity1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en268] Christianity in the 21st century is enshrined in the law of many lands, and evenwhere it is not practiced it has worked its way both overtly and subliminallyinto virtually every sphere of life – marriage patterns, child rearing,education, social and political relationships, ethics, philosophy and so on.Subsumed into Western capitalism, it has also had a huge impact, built up overcenturies, on our relationship with the material world.Consider the account of Creation given in the Old Testament book of Genesis (atext that the Church views as inspired and that fundamentalist Christians tothis day teach as fact.)2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en269] Thecreator is Jehovah, whom the Bogomils and Cathars equated with the Devil. InChapter One we read how he makes heaven and earth, night and day, the oceans,dry land, grass, herbs, trees, fruit. To fill the oceans: ‘God created greatwhales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forthabundantly.’ Land animals come next. Then, on the sixth day: ‘God created man inhis own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created hethem.’ Finally Jehovah invites the first couple to ‘subdue’ the whole earth andgives them:… dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and overevery living thing that moveth upon the earth.3[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en270]This is a code of subjugation and domination, even if it includes somecommon-sense ‘replenishing’ as well.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en271] In the West it set the moralagenda for the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. And even inthe secular modern world it continues, through force of ancient habit and inmany subtle ways, to underwrite the environmental irresponsibility of the bigeconomies and the vast multinational corporations they have spawned.You can see the effects of the Old Testament's righteous sense of dominioneverywhere. The fowl of the air are now battery chickens; many species of thosegreat whales that Jehovah made have been hunted to extinction; fishstocks in theoceans have never been lower; there is a continent-sized hole in the OzoneLayer; and the rainforests of the Amazon – the very lungs of the world – arebeing logged out or burnt at a terrifying rate to make way for cattle ranches.Of course we do not claim that the Christian Church is solely responsible forall this; but neither should its part in the matter be underestimated. Thoughfewer and fewer Westerners study the scriptures today, or would claim to be muchinfluenced by them, all the structures, wealth and international power inheritedfrom the Age of Discovery and the Industrial Revolution were built up by peoplewho did.There are other matters for which the Church and its leaders have been much morecompletely responsible. In Chapters Six and Seven we will tell the story of theAlbigensian Crusades that destroyed the Cathars in the 13th century. No oneacquainted with these terrible events could doubt the absolute disregard of theChristian leadership in Europe for the spiritual rights of others or itswillingness to use lethal force. The same arrogance and blood-lust also showedthemselves in the brutal Crusades between the 11th and the 13th centuriesmounted by European Christian armies to recapture the Holy Land.The faith was therefore only running true to type when it continued to beimposed forcefully by Europeans wherever they went during the Age of Discovery –witness the activities of the Jesuits and other missionaries in Africa, Asia andthe Americas, from the 15th century onwards. Indigenous religions and theircultural treasures were systematically demolished and replaced by Christianity –at incalculable cost to the diversity of human ideas. Where this could not beachieved, notably in the disruptive 1,000-year conflict with Islam, massivetrauma and lasting damage were inflicted on those societies that would notaccept conversion. The suffering, chaos and violence that still continue in theMiddle East today result directly from this ancient legacy of pain – and since11 September 2001 the war has been carried to the West's own front door. In theeyes of Muslim fundamentalists, contemporary Western geopolitics in the MiddleEast are a continuation of the Crusades by modern means and so must be resistedto the death. The result is a flashpoint, built on a millennium of hatred, thatcould yet set the whole world in flames.All in all then it seems reasonable to conclude that established Christianityhas been amongst the great determinative forces of history and that the balefulglobal conditions we confront in the 21st century have much to do with itslong-term influence. A moment can be pinpointed when that influence first beganto be felt – in the early fourth century AD following the conversion toChristianity of the Roman Emperor Constantine. That was the moment whenChristianity first strapped itself to the engine of secular power and (almostimmediately, as we shall see) became a persecuting bureaucracy. In its first 300years, however, it had possessed no unified Church, nor any agreed body offundamental dogma that it might wish to impose on others, nor the ability toimpose it on them. Far from persecuting, Christianity itself had been a despisedand persecuted agglomeration of sects with a very wide range of ideas centredaround the figure and mission of Christ.WHAT WAS SMASHED?The heretical churches of the Bogomils and the Cathars that flourished for a fewbrief centuries in the Middle Ages also centred their ideas around the figureand mission of Christ. How does the impact of their thinking compare with thegiant presence and powers of the established Christian Church? The question isasked specifically with reference to their influence on the world stage andtheir overall importance in the history of mankind.There are scholars who give what seems to be the obvious answer. They argue thatthe Bogomil and Cathar movements are best understood as strictly local responsesto temporary social and economic circumstances in various parts of Europebetween the 10th and the 14th centuries.5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en272] If their view is correct then toknow the whole life story of the heresy we need only examine the immediateconditions surrounding its rise and fall. With no past – and of course no future– its place in history would be small and its impact on the development ofWestern civilisation negligible or nonexistent.We've seen that other scholars like Hans Soderberg and Sir Steven Runcimanoppose this view, arguing that ‘an uninterrupted traditional chain’ connects theCathars and the Bogomils to the religion known as Christian Gnosticism thatflourished in Egypt and the Middle East a thousand years earlier. If they arecorrect then whatever it was that the Church smashed with the AlbigensianCrusades in the 13th century can hardly be described as a short-lived socialmovement. If the links in the chain can be traced back a thousand years, thendoesn't the Cathar phenomenon look much more like a bid for power after amillennium of silence by a parallel persecuted religion, secretive, shadowy, andas old as established Christianity itself?‘THAT MOST WICKED SECT OF OBSCENE MEN WHO ARE CALLED PAULICIANS …’Working back from the Cathars, for whom there are no unambiguous reports priorto the mid-12th century, we come to the Bogomils. They are first heard of in the10th century and survived in some isolated communities in Eastern Europe untilthe 15th century. Not only did they predate and outlive the Cathars, therefore,but also there is consensus amongst the scholars that Catharism in the West didarise as a direct result of Bogomil missionary activity.The next link in the proposed ‘chain of the great heresy’ overlaps in time withthe Bogomils in a similar way, and again with a significantly earlier origin.The link is formed by a strange and uniquely warlike dualist sect known as thePaulicians. They co-existed with the Bogomils and are thought to have played asignificant part in shaping the ideas of the pop Bogomil himself in the 10thcentury.6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en273]As with most heretical movements, much that we know about them comes from theiropponents in the Christian Church. One of these was the monk Peter of Sicilywhose History of the Manicheans who are also called Paulicians contains valuablecontemporary information on the sect. Peter learned about them at first hand inAD 869 – 70 when Emperor Basil I of Constantinople sent him as an ambassador tothe Paulician leader Chrysocheir – who had recently established an independentprincipality on the Arab-Byzantine frontier.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en274]As we can see from the title of his tract, Peter assumed that the Paulicianreligion was merely a disguised form of Manicheism. This is understandable. ThePaulicians and the followers of Mani were dualists, exactly like the laterBogomils and Cathars. But the Paulicians’ account of their own origins, whichPeter of Sicily also helpfully preserved for us, makes no claim of descent fromMani. Instead it traces the sect's beliefs back to a certain Constantine ofMananalis who had lived in what is now Armenia during the reign of the ByzantineEmperor Constans I (AD 641 – 648).8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en275] Constantine of Mananalis, in histurn, is said to have been influenced by a mysterious ‘deacon’ who stayed at hishome ‘after returning from prison in Syria’ and gave him a number of booksincluding a ‘Gospel book and a book of the Epistles of St. Paul, on which he …based his teaching.’9 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en276]So clearly there must have been something ‘Christian’ about these Paulicians ifthe teachings of their founder were based on Christian texts. Indeed it turnsout that Christ was the central figure in their religion but that just like theCathars and Bogomils they refused utterly to accept that he had ever been born‘in the flesh’ or that Mary was his mother.10[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en277] Since he did not possess aphysical body how could he have had a mother? Like the Cathars and the Bogomilsthey believed him to have been a non-physical emanation of the God of Good, anemissary from the spiritual realms. 11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en278] Like the Cathars and the Bogomilsthey rejected the cross and all the material sacraments of establishedChristianity, as well as the cults of saints and of icons. 12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en279] Like the Cathars and the Bogomilsthey entirely rejected the Old Testament and did not accept every part of theNew Testament. 13 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en280] And again likethe Cathars and the Bogomils they claimed that theirs was the only true Church,descended directly from the first Christian communities, and that the RomanCatholic and Orthodox Churches were imposters. 14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en281]The supreme leader of the Paulicians, wielding absolute spiritual and secularpower, was known as the didaskalos. His followers regarded him, says Peter ofSicily as ‘the apostle of Christ’.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en282] Constantine of Mananalis in theseventh century was revered as the first didaskalos, but all his successors heldthe same title and each was considered ‘the authoritative teacher of theChristian revelation in his own generation.’16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en283]Although we do not know the exact date that Constantine of Mananalis began hisministry, historians generally set it around AD 655.17[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en284] He acted from the beginning, sayhistorians Janet and Bernard Hamilton, as though he were:… restoring the true Church that had been founded by Saint Paul … Laterdidaskaloi followed Constantine's example and took the names of Paul'sdisciples, and also called their churches after places visited by Paul. Theimplication was that they were restoring the true apostolic Church.18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en285]Understandably these heretics referred to themselves simply as ‘Christians’(again something they have in common with the Bogomils and the Cathars wholikewise called themselves ‘Good Christians’).19[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en286] The name Paulicians apparently hadnothing to do with their attachment to Saint Paul but came into general usagelong after the sect was formed and was bestowed on them by others. It is mostplausibly explained as a derivation from the didaskalos Paul, who led thesemi-nomadic sect back to Armenia in the eighth century.20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en287]But while the Paulicians thought of themselves as true Christians, the OrthodoxChurch and the Byzantine Empire thought otherwise. Constantine of Manalis waseventually executed for heresy on the orders of Emperor Constantine IV (AD 668 –685). Historians believe it most likely he was burnt at the stake, although thePaulicians themselves put about a story that he was stoned to death. It has beensuggested that this was probably ‘to draw a parallel between their first martyrand the first Christian martyr Stephen’.21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en288]The second Paulician didaskalos, who took the name Titus, was also executed forheresy, this time definitely by burning.22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en289]During the eighth century the Paulicians enjoyed long periods of officialtolerance, although John of Otzun, who became catholicos of Armenia in AD 717,described them as ‘that most wicked sect of obscene men who are calledPaulicians.’23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en290] What he objected tomost was that they scorned the established clergy as ‘idolaters’ because oftheir ‘worship of the cross.’24 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en291]But he does not seem to have had the secular support to do anything about this.It was not until the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Michael I (811 – 813) thatthe death penalty was reimposed for followers of the Paulician faith,25[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en292] There then followed a period ofmassive imperial persecution in which, according to the official chroniclers100,000 of the heretics were killed26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en293] – a scale of slaughter fullycomparable with the holocaust of the Languedoc Cathars 400 years later. In the840s, in response to the continuing persecutions, a faction of the Paulicians,including a fighting group 5,000 strong, retreated into Arab territories. By the850s they had established their own independent mini-state based around thefortress city of Tefrice on the Byzantine frontier. It was to the court of thePaulician leader Chrysocheir at Tefrice that Peter of Sicily came on his embassyof 869 – 70. Two years later Chrysocheir was killed in battle with Byzantineforces and Tefrice finally surrendered in 878. 27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en294]This was a setback, but certainly not the end of the Paulicians. Around 975 theywere still causing enough trouble in the Byzantine Empire for the Church toinsist that large numbers of them be deported from the Eastern provinces. Theywere sent to the Balkans, where there was already a long-established Pauliciancommunity28 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en295] and where the popBogomil had begun to spread his own heresy only a few years previously. ThePaulicians almost certainly bequeathed to the Bogomils their belief in the stateof opposition of the material and spiritual realms – of the God of Evil and theGod of Good. Moreover the Paulicians identified this very aspect of theirbeliefsystem as the chief factor that distinguished them from the Roman Catholicand Orthodox Churches. They told Peter of Sicily:We say the heavenly father is one God who has no power in this world, but whohas power in the world to come, and that there is another God who made the worldand who has power over the present world. The Romans confess that the heavenlyfather and the creator of all the world are one and the same God .29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en296]This doctrine of the two opposed Gods is precisely the position of the Bogomilsand the Cathars. And they also shared with the Paulicians a view of the cosmosas a battleground between good and evil with the fate of humanity as itsfulcrum.30 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en297]In other respects, however, there was much less of a resemblance. Mostprominently, although they attributed the creation of the world and all materialthings to the God of Evil, the Paulicians did not practice any form ofasceticism, were not vegetarians, and placed no special value on chastity andabstinence. They were also men of violence who often found themselves in battleand who were widely recognised by others as formidable warriors.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en298] In this sense we might regard themas an entire community of that grade of neophytes whom the Cathars calledcredentes (‘believers’) who were free to fight, marry and make love as theywished, to eat and to drink, and generally to live in the world and to affirmit. Consistent with this it seems that the Paulicians did not make use of anyinitiation ceremony and thus had no class of initiated adepts or perfecti as theCathars and Bogomils did.32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en299]THE PRAYING PEOPLE AND THE DEMON IN THE SOULAlthough there can be little doubt that the Paulicians were amongst theimportant influences on the emergence of the Bogomils, the differences betweenthe two religions make it clear that other factors must also have been in play.As one of these factors, and the next main link in the chain of transmission,Steven Runciman proposes a sect known as the Messalians (literally the ‘PrayingPeople’).33 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en300] They were ChristianGnostics34 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en301] whose origins can betraced back to the city of Edessa in the mid-fourth century AD and who survivedin coherent form until late enough in the seventh century to overlap withConstantine of Mananalis and the first Paulicians.35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en302] They were said to have been thekeepers of a secret tradition and of secret books which Runciman presumes tohave been ‘heterodox Gnostic legends.’36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en303] He argues that the riches of thisesoteric literary tradition reached the Bogomils directly from communities ofMessalians who survived in the Balkans beyond the seventh century and indeeduntil as late as the 11th century.Runciman sees Bogomilism as a combination of Paulician and Messalian doctrines –‘a new Christianity … based on early Christian legend and Eastern Dualism.’37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en304] Probably the influence ofPaulicianism came first:… but as time went on the new faith developed; the heretics came into touch withthe Messalians, who gave them access to all the wealth of the OrientalisedGnostic tradition …38 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en305] The Bogomils… largely owed their mythology to these books that medieval Byzantium hadinherited from the Christians of the first few centuries, when Christiandoctrine was still imperfectly circumscribed and Gnostic tendencies were rife.39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en306]Naturally in this contentious field, other scholars dispute that the Messaliansever came into contact with the Bogomils at all – on the grounds that the formerhad ceased to exist before the latter were founded. According to BernardHamilton, professor emeritus in crusading history at the University ofNottingham, it is all a matter of mislabelling:There is no evidence that organised Messalianism survived beyond the 7thcentury, even though the label continued to be used by Byzantine heresiologiststo describe excesses in Orthodox monastic practice. There can therefore havebeen no possibility of contact between the Bogomils and a living Messaliantradition.40 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en307]Let's acknowledge these opposing points of view. Still the fact remains thatmany Orthodox churchmen of the period, highly skilled in exposing heresy, wereconvinced, like Runciman, that Messalianism was still alive and well in theBalkans as late as the 11th century – and thus did overlap with Bogomilism. TheBogomils themselves were often mislabelled ‘Messalians’, not, we would suggest,because of ignorance on the part of the heresiologists but because the Messalianand Bogomil religions were similar in many ways and do strongly suggest someform of influence of the former on the latter.The Messalians placed great emphasis on a ritual initiation that created a classof elect or adepts, called the pneumatics, directly comparable to the Catharperfecti.41 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en308] The same term was alsoused by other sects of Christian Gnostics as early as the first and secondcenturies AD for their own initiated spiritual elites.42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en309] So there's a sense of the Bogomilsstanding at one end of the first millennium, the early Christian Gnosticsstanding at the other, and the Messalians standing roughly in the middle andsomehow connected to both ‘ends’.Other shared characteristics add to this impression. For instance, like theBogomils (and their offshoot the Cathars), the Messalians rejected the OldTestament and loathed the cross.43 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en310]So too did the early Christian Gnostics .44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en311] The Bogomils and the Messaliansregarded the world as an evil creation. So too did the Gnostics. And as part ofthis outlook, very similar creation stories were also told by all three groups.Indeed the Messalian version is a classic ‘moderate dualist’ myth of the kindthe Bogomils and the Cathars favoured in their early days before becoming moreabsolute in their views. As such it does not propose polarised divinities ofGood and Evil, one the creator of the spiritual and one of the material realm.Instead the Messalians envisaged the prior existence of a single deity, ‘God thefirst Principle’, whose domain was entirely spiritual and good and filled withlight. He produced two ‘Sons’ – emanations – of whom the elder was Satan and theyounger Christ. Pride and envy caused Satan to rebel against the Father and ledto his expulsion from the good and spiritual heaven:45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en312]The material world was his creation after his Fall and as such was a wickedplace.46 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en313]The Messalians, like the Bogomils after them, and the early Christian Gnosticsbefore them, had a theory to explain how our souls had become trapped in matter.Though similar in general principle and outlook, these theories differsignificantly from each other in terms of plot and detail. For the Bogomils, aswe've seen in Chapter Three, the idea was that the souls of fallen angels hadbeen encysted in our bodies, or that we carry within us, always seeking a wayback to heaven, the spark of divine life breathed by God into the Devil's clumsy‘Adam’ and his progeny. The Messalians, on the other hand, believed that everysoul was possessed by a demon which bound it by force to the wicked materialworld. The only way to eject the demon and gain release for the imprisoned soulwas through extreme asceticism sustained over a period years47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en314] – a regime very similar to theextensive apprenticeships and mortification of the flesh that Bogomil and Catharneophytes underwent before they could receive the consolamentum and be elevatedto perfectus grade.The Messalians also made use of emotional and dramatic prayer (hence their name‘Praying People’) to help drive out the demons.48[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en315] However they had just one prayerin their repertoire – the Pater Noster (‘Our Father’), also known as the Lord'sPrayer.49 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en316] Using prayer to driveout demons is not a custom that we find amongst the Bogomils and the Cathars.Nonetheless, like the Messalians, they too, used no other prayer but the PaterNoster. This was because it is the only prayer that the Bible attributesdirectly to Christ himself.Described as ‘troop of vagabond preachers’,50[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en317] the Messalians first appeared inthe territory of the Eastern Roman Empire around AD 350. This was less than 40years after Constantine the Great had extended his official protection to theChristian Church. It was just 20 years after he had forsaken Rome to establishhis new capital of Constantinople on the site of the ancient Greek city ofByzantium (modern Istanbul).With its principal bishoprics in Rome, Alexandria, Antioch and Constantinople,the recently-empowered Catholic Church was by this time flexing its muscles, andin a sense defining itself, by the heresies it persecuted. After winning statesponsorship in AD 312 it had almost immediately taken a strong authoritarian andliteralist turn (literalist in the sense of interpreting the scriptures in themost literal manner possible). This, inevitably made the rather free-thinkingand creative anarchy of the Christian Gnostics, who had previously been allowedto co-exist with the literalists, a target for heresy hunters. In AD 390 theMessalians were condemned and added to the Church's growing list of bannedsects, which, as we will see, already included several other muchlonger-established Christian Gnostic groups.51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en318]MANI, MESSENGER OF LIGHTThe teachings and philosophy of another sect are also an important part of thisjigsaw puzzle. Known as Manicheism after its founder Mani, it was younger thansome of the Christian Gnostic movements but a century older than the Messalians.It too was viciously persecuted by the Church as a ‘heresy’, rather than as apagan religion. Yet there is a dispute amongst scholars as to whether Manicheismwas Christian in any meaningful sense at all.52[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en319] Certainly it was much less‘Christian’ than the religion of the Bogomils and the Cathars, and that, aswe've seen, cannot accurately be described as ‘Christianity’; it was really acompletely different faith built up around many of the same New Testament textsand characters.Perhaps the confusion comes in because Mani sometimes claimed to be the ‘Apostleof Christ’53 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en320] (later also one ofthe titles of the Paulician didaskaloi), and because surviving letters sentbetween communities of Manicheans in North Africa show that they saw themselvesas Christians.54 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en321] It is alsogenerally accepted that several of the strong central notions of Christianity,including the idea that there is ‘a redemptive meaning to things’, are found inManicheism.55 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en322]On the other hand there is much in Manicheism that seems to be unmistakablynon-Christian. For a start, it was an uncompromisingly dualistic religion inexactly the same way as the religion of the Cathars and Bogomils. It saw thehuman race, endlessly regenerated by the snare of reproduction, as the creationof an Evil God – an idea that we know Christianity rejects. Similarly,Manicheans made little or no use of New Testament texts. They offered worship tothe Sun and the Moon as ‘vessels of the Light’ (in this very unlike the Catharsand the Bogomils). And despite sometimes calling himself the ‘Apostle ofChrist’, it is notable that Mani also frequently used the broader term ‘Apostleof God’.56 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en323] He meant that he was anemissary or messenger and he placed himself as the successor to Christ at theend of a line of earlier, non-Christian, apostles.Obviously the Church saw this as heresy. It involved Christ, but clearlydevalued the unique quality of his mission by putting him on a par with thefounders of well-known pagan religions. One of Mani's own surviving statementson the matter, in his Book for King Shapur (circa AD 250) makes this completelyclear:From age to age the Apostles of God did not cease to bring here the wisdom andworks of the spirit. Thus in one age their coming was into the countries ofIndia through the Apostle that was the Buddha; into another age, into the landof Persia through Zoroaster; into another, into the land of the West throughJesus. After that, in this last age, this revelation came down, and thisprophethood arrived through myself, Mani, the Apostle of the true God, into theland of Babel.57 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en324]In this fragment Buddha, Zoroaster, Jesus and Mani are given as examples, not asa definitive list, of the apostles of God. In another surviving fragment Maninames two more such messengers: the Greek philosopher Plato (427 – 347 BC), andthe Greek deity Hermes.58 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en325] InMani's time the latter, who we will meet again in Part II, was generally equatedwith Thoth, the ancient Egyptian god of wisdom.MEETINGS WITH THE TWINDespite the extensive persecution of Manicheism by different regimes indifferent periods over hundreds of years, some of the details of Mani'sbiography, and of his claims to a sacred mission, seem to have come down to usfairly reliably.He was born in or about AD 216 in a village called Mardinu to the south of thecity of Ctesiphon near Babylon59 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en326] –a location some 32 kilometers southeast of Baghdad in the modern state of Iraq.In Mani's time Ctesiphon enjoyed great wealth, prominence and political powerwithin Persia as the winter capital of the king. It had served this function forthe Parthian Empire that ruled from 247 BC until AD 224 (when Mani was abouteight years old), and it continued to do so with renewed grandeur under theSassanian Empire (AD 224 – 642) that succeeded the Parthians.The Sassanians were decidedly national and Persian in character. Their firstking, Ardeshir I (AD 224 – 241) moved rapidly to install the ancient Persianfaith of Zoroastrianism as the official religion of the empire and gave enormouspowers to its priesthood, the Magi. Living in the neighbourhood of Ctesiphon atthis time, therefore, we can be sure that Mani would have been well acquaintedwith Zoroastrianism – although traditions that he was for some time a Magushimself are unlikely to be true .60[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en327] Since the region was a culturalcrossroads of the ancient world, a young man like Mani, deeply interested inspiritual matters, would also have been exposed here to a wide range of otherpotential influences – amongst them Babylonian astrology, Judaism, Buddhism fromIndia, and the philosophy of Greece.61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en328]More directly, it is known that Mani was reared amongst an obscure sect ofJewish Christians called the Elchasaitans62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en329] (considered to have beenGnostics,63 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en330] and linked by somescholars with the Essenes of Dead Sea Scrolls fame).64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en331] They were mystics and visionarieswith strict purity laws and repetitive rituals that Mani rebelled against. Butthrough them he was exposed to an additional vital influence on his thinking –the teachings of the Christian Gnostics.65[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en332] Although later to be persecuted asheresy, these teachings were still in free circulation in the first half of thethird century and are generally agreed to have had a great impact on theconstruction of Mani's own distinctively Gnostic religion.66[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en333]Secret texts passed down within the Elchasaitans, or within his own family, mayalso have played a role. In this respect it is interesting that some accountspresent Mani as the adopted son of an elderly widow. The story goes that on herdeath she entrusted him with a precious legacy of four books of sacred knowledge– from which, critics alleged, he derived many of the teachings that he laterclaimed as his own .67 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en334] The contentof these books was said to have been gathered in Egypt ‘in the time of theapostles’ by a certain Scythianus who had learned the ‘wisdom of theEgyptians.’68 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en335] Scythianus dictatedthe books to his disciple Terebinthus. In due course Terebinthus brought thebooks to Babylonia and on his death they passed to his own disciple – the widowwho would adopt Mani in her old age.69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en336]Though legends say that he was a sickly child and lame in one leg,70[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en337] it seems that Mani grew up inprosperous circumstances.71 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en338] Laterhe would claim that throughout his childhood he had received revelationsdirectly from Ahura Mazda, the ‘Father of the Light’ – the God of Goodness inthe Zoroastrian faith.72 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en339] He alsoexperienced strange and disturbing visitations of the type normally treatedtoday with powerful anti-psychotic drugs. In one surviving text (the CologneMani-Codex) he tells us how he was:… guarded by the might of the Light-angels and the exceedingly strong powers.who had a command from Jesus the Splendour for my safekeeping …73[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en340] They nourished me with visions andsigns which they made known to me, slight and quite brief, as far as I was able.For sometimes like a flash of lightening he came …74[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en341]The being who sometimes came to Mani like a ‘flash of lightening’ was an angel –one he regarded as a manifestation of his own higher identity and referred tovariously as his ‘Light-Self’ and as al-Taum, ‘the Twin’ .75[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en342] When Mani was 12 years old theTwin appeared to him in a vision and informed him that he was to be responsiblefor transmitting a great teaching to mankind. In order to do this, he would haveto leave the Elchasaitans at some time in the future. Thereafter the young Manilived a quiet and studious life, out of the limelight, gathering knowledge insecret, tutored by divine revelations and by his angel:With the greatest possible ingenuity and skill I went about in that Law [of theElchasaitans], preserving my hope in my heart; no one perceived who it was thatwas with me, and I myself revealed nothing to anyone during that great period oftime. But neither did I, like them, keep the fleshly custom … I revealed nothingof what happened, or of what will happen, nor what it is that I knew, or what itis that I had received …76 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en343]It was probably during this same period of learning that Mani honed the skillsas a painter, which traditions say he later used to illustrate his teachings,and acquired the knowledge of astronomy and mathematics for which he would alsobe renowned .77 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en344]When Mani reached the age of 24, the Twin appeared to him and announced:The time has now come for thee to manifest thyself publicly and to proclaim thydoctrine aloud.78 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en345]Next, says Mani, the Twin:… delivered, separated and pulled me away from the midst of that Law in which Iwas reared. In this way he called, chose, drew, and severed me from their midst,drawing me to the divine side.79 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en346]He also initiated Mani into a gnosis:Concerning me, who I am, and who my inseparable Twin is … And who my Father onhigh is; or in what way, severed from him, I was sent out according to hispurpose; and what sort of commission and counsel he has given me before Iclothed myself in this instrument [the body], and before I was led astray inthis detestable flesh … Moreover, concerning my soul, which exists as the soulof all the worlds, both what it itself is and how it came to be. Beside these herevealed to me the boundless heights and the unfathomable depths;80[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en347] he revealed mysteries hidden tothe world which are not permitted for anyone to see or hear …81[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en348] He showed me all. 82[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en349]MANI AND THE MAGIIt was at this point, around AD 240, that Mani – a sleeper at last awakened –began his preaching mission.83 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en350]What he was preaching was distinctly not Zoroastrianism, and Ardeshir I,champion of the Zoroastrian faith as the official religion of Persia, was stillon the throne. Mani seems to have fallen foul of the Magi almost immediately andto have been forced into exile.84 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en351]He travelled to India, by all accounts propagating his teaching with greatsuccess there,85 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en352] and returned viathe Persian Gulf in 241, the year of Ardeshir's death. Somehow Mani managed toconvert Firuz, Ardeshir's youngest son and, through him, obtained a personalaudience with the eldest son Shapur – who shortly afterwards succeeded to thethrone as King Shapur I. 86 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en353] At thecoronation Mani was permitted to come forward to proclaim his own spiritualmessage – an unprecedented honour. 87[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en354] And on either 21 March 242 or 9April 243 (the date is disputed by historians) Shapuhr issued a letterauthorising Mani to preach as he wished and protecting him throughout thePersian Empire.88 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en355]Thereafter, freed of all obstructions, Manicheism won converts at a phenomenalrate causing intense resentment and jealousy amongst the Zoroastrian priesthood.There was a backlash and later in Shapur's reign it seems that the Magipersuaded the king to exile Mani a second time.89[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en356] But in 272, following Shapur'sdeath, Mani returned to Persia and was welcomed by the latest successor to thethrone, King Hormuzd, who once again extended royal favour to him.90[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en357]Hormuzhd's reign lasted barely a year and Bahram I, who succeeded to the thronein 273, was a strong supporter of the old Zoroastrian faith. He reversed thepolicy of tolerance towards Manicheism and began to persecute its leaders andfollowers. In 276 his officers arrested Mani at Gundeshapur in southwesternPersia. The self-styled ‘Apostle of God’ was then subjected to four days ofInquisition-style interrogation by the Magi, and declared to be zandic – a‘heretic’. A month of imprisonment in heavy chains followed after which he wasflayed alive and then decapitated. His head was impaled on the city gate, fromwhich his skin, stuffed with straw, was also suspended; what remained of hisbody was thrown to the dogs.91 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en358]No doubt the level of brutality in his execution was commensurate with the levelof the threat that the Magi saw in Mani's new religion which was everywhereovertaking them. And just as was the case with the destruction of Catharism bythe Roman Catholic Church a thousand years later, a determined attempt was alsomade by the Zoroastrians to wipe out Manicheism completely. 92[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en359]They did not succeed. Before his imprisonment and execution Mani had alreadysent out his 12 disciples, and hosts of followers, to all the corners of theknown world.93 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en360] In addition thecontinuing persecutions by the Zoroastrian state after 276 prompted alarge-scale migration of Manichean communities. Some travelled deep into China –where Mani's religion would survive in remote enclaves until as late as the 16thcentury. Others infiltrated Eastern parts of the Roman Empire, the Romancolonies in North Africa, and eventually all the immense territories underRome's control as far west as Britain.Though at times violently opposed by Rome (even before its conversion toChristianity) Manicheism won immense popularity throughout the empire and wasparticularly well represented in its North African colonies. It was in NorthAfrica that it acquired its most famous acolyte, Augustine – later SaintAugustine of Hippo. Born in AD 354, the son of a pagan father and a Christianmother, he became a Manichean auditor or hearer in AD 377 – equivalent tojoining the Cathar class of credente. He held to the Manichean faith for nineyears then abandoned it in 386 and was baptized as a Christian in 387. Hereturned to North Africa where he formed a religious community and was appointedbishop of Hippo in 396. He lived to see the fall of Rome to the Vandals in 410.When he died in 430 Vandal forces had crossed the Mediterranean and werebesieging Hippo itself.94 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en361]Like many converts Augustine zealously detestated his former faith. During hislong and influential career as one of the great doctors of the Church he wroteextensively condemning Manicheism and the Manicheans. His anti-Manichean tractssurvived the ages and played an important part in shaping the attitudes ofmedieval Roman Catholics to the Cathar heresy. As we saw in Chapter TwoCatharism was frequently identified in the 12th and 13th centuries as aresurgence of the same Manicheism that Augustine had censured in the fourthcentury – a conclusion that modern scholars reject. Nevertheless the Cathar andManichean religions were, in our view, similar enough in their essentials tomake the medieval identification understandable and worth further consideration.THE COSMOS ACCORDING TO MANIOne of the notions upon which Manicheism is founded is that there existed fromthe beginning of time ‘two gods, uncreated and eternal and everlastingly opposedto each other.’95 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en362] One is the Godof Evil and Darkness, the other the God of Good and the Light.96[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en363] The realm of Light was theuppermost and was ‘without bounds in height and on each side.’ The realm ofDarkness lay below it similarly boundless in depth and on each side .97[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en364] For untold ages neither was awareof the other's existence, but in the bowels of the Darkness was Satan, with his‘disorderly, anarchical, restless brood’ of demonic powers.98[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en365] There was constant agitation,chaos and turmoil, as in the heart of a black thunderstorm, and at some pointthe Prince of Darkness rose up through the abyss, perceived the Light from theupper world and conceived a hatred for it. Returning to the depths he preparedhis forces:Then again springing upwards, he invaded the realms of Light with the intentionof there spreading calamity and destruction. 99[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en366]Like the later Cathars and Bogomils Mani saw the human body as part of the evilcreation within which sparks of the Light had been imprisoned. Like the Catharsand the Bogomils he taught that sexual reproduction and reincarnation are themechanisms by which the cycle of imprisonment is perpetuated. And also like theCathars and Bogomils he believed that by abstinence and prayer this imprisonedLight could gradually be released, but that we must pass through manyincarnations, and much pain, before that would happen.100[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en367]Such resemblances to the religion of the medieval dualists become all theclearer when we realise, as Yuri Stoyanov confirms, that Light and Darkness inManichean cosmology are metaphors for spirit and matter.101[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en368] It was the fusion of these twocontrary principles, at the beginning of the present cycle of time, which causedthe imprisonment and suffering of the soul in the first place.102[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en369] The details of exactly how theimprisonment was achieved – how fragments of the Light came to be trapped inDarkness, how Good ended up mixed with Evil, how souls were enwrapped in matter– may have more to do with the inspiration of individual storytellers thananything else. We know that this was a tradition that made broad use ofcolourful symbols, myths and parables as teaching aids. But the point, in thefinal analysis, is that the medieval dualists of Europe, exactly like theManicheans of Persia centuries earlier, envisaged man as a ‘mixed’ creature whomust fight a constant war within himself in order to subdue his baser elements,and to perfect and liberate his soul.It was to get this point across that the Cathars and Bogomils told stories ofangels who had fallen downwards from the pure spiritual realm of heaven to theimpure material realm of earth. In the parallel Manichean myth the Prince ofDarkness with his demons rushed upwards out of the abyss to attack and destroythe Light. So forceful and impetuous was this onslaught that the Evil One,wielding the ‘malign’ powers of Smoke, Fire, Wind, Water and Darkness as hisweapons, broke through the defences and encroached upon the Light. The Father ofLight defended his realm by evoking a proxy – the ‘Primal Man’ – and arming himwith the ‘luminous’ powers of Air, Wind, Light, Water and Fire. Battle wasjoined, Satan was victorious, the Primal Man lay in a deathlike trance, andelements of the luminous powers that he had been armed with were now engulfed or‘eaten’ by the forces of darkness.103[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en370]Next the Father of Light created further emanations or proxies – amongst themthe ‘Living Spirit’, identified with the pre-Zoroastrian Iranian god Mithra, anda figure called the ‘Great Architect’ .104[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en371] Together they revived and rescuedthe Primal Man and began the work of recovering for the Light the luminouspowers that had been consumed by the forces of Darkness – a task described assaving the ‘Living Soul’ from the ‘burning house’ of matter. 105[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en372]The diabolical counter-attack against the works of the Living Spirit and theGreat Architect involved the creation of Adam and Eve ‘to fortify’, as Stoyanovputs it, ‘the imprisonment of the Light elements through the lust andreproduction of the human species.’ But the realm of Light sent a saviour toAdam who made him aware of the Light existing within himself – i.e. his immortalsoul – and caused him to rebel against the Evil One who had fashioned his body.Ever since the human race has ‘remained the principal battleground between theforces of Light and Darkness.’106 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en373]The saviour sent to Adam is called ‘Jesus the Splendour’ in the Manichean texts.107 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en374] As time passes other savioursare sent, each of them to renew the gnosis needed to awaken man to his truecondition. Earlier we listed some of the household names amongst these saviours– Zoroaster, Hermes, Plato, Buddha, Jesus Christ, and last but not least Mani.Other lists echo the spread of Manicheism in Hebraic cultures and feature Seth,Enoch (like Hermes frequently identified with the ancient Egyptian wisdom godThoth), Noah, Abraham, and again Mani.108[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en375] Similarly the eastwards expansionof Manicheism is reflected in other formulations that refer to Mani as theBuddha of Light or as a reincarnation of Lao-Tsu, the founder of Taoism.109[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en376]In all cases and in all lists Mani is extolled as the ‘Seal of the Prophets’.110 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en377] It is he who brings the finalmessage, the final revelation and the final gnosis through which mankind is tocomplete the great work of freeing the last elements of Light from the prison ofDarkness. This work, as described, is almost alchemical in character – anintricate, gradual process of distillation down the ages, incarnation afterincarnation, channelling the Light away from the Dark, purifying the soul fromits contamination with matter. The denouement is our realisation that thephysical earth on which we live was brought into existence as the theatre orlaboratory in which this process of endless, painstaking refinement could unfold– and for no other purpose.111 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en378]Finally, using all the Light thus reclaimed, the Great Architect and the LivingSpirit, assisted by the souls of the Manichean elect, are to construct a ‘NewParadise’ and a spiritual earth to replace the dark, leaden husk of the oldmaterial creation that will fall away at the completion of the project.112[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en379]IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK, SWIMS LIKE A DUCK, AND QUACKS LIKE A DUCK … THEN ITPROBABLY IS A DUCK …Although the Manicheans, Bogomils and Cathars told different stories about thehuman predicament, we suggest that closer examination shows that they share adeep and abiding theme. At the heart of it all, for every credente andperfectus, for every hearer and elect, was a desire to live in the world in sucha way as to minimise spiritual pollution and to improve, strengthen, purify andultimately (after great struggle) liberate the soul. In all cases this involvedaccepting and following a system and working within a structure, and these wereremarkably the same from the early days of Manicheism in the third century AD tothe final crushing of medieval dualism in Europe more than 1,000 years later.Just like the Bogomil and the Cathar Churches, the Manichean Church was dividedinto two principal categories. There were the ordinary the rank and fileadherents who could marry, have children, own property, eat meat and drink wine.And there was a small highly-committed elite of celibate teetotal vegetarianswho lived in personal poverty and renounced all the material pleasures oflife.113 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en380] The rank and file wereknown as the hearers and the elite as the elect – concepts identical in allrespects to the credentes and perfecti of the medieval dualists. Indeed amongstthe Manicheans the term perfecti was used interchangeably with elect. 114[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en381]Like the Cathar and Bogomil perfecti the Manichean elect could be men or womenand always travelled in adept-disciple pairs. Also like the perfecti, the electpassed through a strict process of initiation culminating in a ceremonycomparable to the consolamentum. Following this initiation they were consideredto be ‘full of the Light’ and thenceforward must do nothing to contaminate theirinner light with the dark of earthly things. 115[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en382] For the Manichean elect thatincluded doing no agricultural work and not even such a simple task as breakingbread. It involved leading a wandering, penniless existence, possessing only‘food for a day and clothes for the year’, completely dependent upon the charityof the hearers who, by joining the Manichean Church, took on an obligation tocare for the elect.116 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en383] Althoughthe Cathar and Bogomil perfecti did break bread for themselves, they too ledwandering, penniless lives and were dependent on the charity of the credenteswho likewise had a duty to care for them. Moreover even Bernard Hamilton, thoughnot normally a fan of the ‘continuing tradition’, has to admit that:The Manicheans had required their elect to observe an ascetic rule of life, andtheir reasons for doing so were identical to those of the Bogomils, springingfrom a conviction that the material creation was evil.117[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en384]Mani taught that messengers like Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus – to whose line healso claimed to belong – had been sent to earth out of sympathy for mankind, toremove the clouds of ignorance from our minds, to teach us Truth, and to rescuethe Light in us (i.e. our shining souls) from Darkness and Evil.118[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en385] Again these are themes that areentirely familiar from the dualism of the Cathars and the Bogomils.The reader will recall that the Cathars and Bogomils, believing Jesus to havebeen a spiritual emanation of the Good God, could not accept that he had everbeen born in the flesh and therefore concluded that he must have been anapparition sent down directly from the heavenly realms. The identical idea wasvoiced by Mani who preached, centuries earlier, that Jesus was not born of womanbut came forth from the Father of Light and descended from heaven in the form ofa man aged about 30. The body in which he appeared was an illusion and so,accordingly, was his Crucifixion.119[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en386] In one Manichean text he evenappears afterwards to his disciple John who is grief-stricken at the supposeddeath of his master and informs him that the Crucifixion was a spectacle, aphantasmagoria, in short a kind of miracle play performed to impress themasses.120 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en387]Despite their conviction that material life is evil the Cathars, Bogomils andManicheans all showed great respect for life and opposed causing pain orsuffering of any kind to fellow creatures whether human or animal.121[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en388] All believed in reincarnation. 122[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en389] All forbade the use of images andworshipped only through prayers and hymns.123[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en390] We know that the Cathars and theBogomils looked with horror on the Old Testament and regarded its God, Jehovah,as the Devil. So too did the Manicheans 124[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en391] and Mani himself had declared:It is the Prince of Darkness who spoke with Moses, the Jews and their priest.Thus the Christians, the Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same errorwhen they worship this god. For he led them astray in the lusts that he taughtthem, since he was not the God of Truth.125[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en392]CONNECTING THE CATHARS TO THE FIRST CENTURY ADUntil the early 20th century scholars were obliged to rely almost exclusively onthe works of the persecutors of Manicheism in order to reconstruct the ‘lost’Manichean religion that those very persecutors had destroyed. But intact ancientManichean texts discovered in the Far East in the 1920s and in Egypt in the1970s have added greatly to our store of knowledge. In consequence it is nowgenerally accepted that Christian Gnosticism, hitherto allocated a relativelyminor role in the intellectual parentage of Manicheism, may in fact have beenthe single most decisive influence on Mani's thinking. H. J. W. Drijvers goes sofar as to suggest that even the term ‘Christian Gnosticism’ is misleading:It has usually been assumed that the Christian elements in Manicheism reachedMani through a Gnostic filter … It is rather more in agreement with thehistorical situation and development during the third century … to assume thatMani and Manicheism heavily drew upon the whole of Christian tradition andliterature extant in that time without any restriction to a supposedly Gnosticstrain.126 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en393]In other words if Manicheism as it is now understood reveals an overwhelminginfluence from Gnostic Christianity then this is likely to be because theChristianity of Mani's time was in fact overwhelmingly Gnostic – a controversialconclusion that is nevertheless supported by much recent scholarship. In 1945 agreat hoard of hitherto unknown Gnostic texts from the early centuries of theChristian era was found at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt. Since the translation andeventual publication of these texts in 1977 it has become apparent thatChristianity's relationship with Gnosticism goes back to the very beginnings ofthe Christian cult in the first century AD. Likewise it is now obvious, andwidely accepted, that ‘Christian Gnosticism’ was not some weird offshoot fromthe ‘mainstream’ of Christianity. On the contrary it was part of the mainstream– perhaps even the major part as we will see in the next chapter.And then something happened. From the beginning of the fourth century AD, as itacquired state power, the Church undertook a radical change of direction. Thefreethinking and sometimes anarchical approach of the Gnostics began to befrowned upon, their allegorical interpretations of the scriptures were droppedin favour of literal ones, and persecutions for heresy began almost immediately.Could it possibly be true, as the Cathars always claimed, that this was the timewhen the authentic church of Christianity was forced underground and theimposter Church of Rome was put in its place? And the corollary: could it betrue that the authentic church – persecuted, outlawed, oppressed – hadnevertheless somehow managed to survive from the fourth century until itsdoctrines reappeared again 600 years later with the Bogomils?It seems like a long shot. Nonetheless we've shown that a viable chain oftransmission exists connecting the central ideas behind the Cathar and Bogomilreligions to the ideas of Mani in the third century. And if the primaryinfluence on Mani was Christian Gnosticism, as the scholars now agree, then itis to the Gnostics we should look for the final links in the chain of the ‘GreatHeresy’."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEKNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE NATURE OF THINGSI shall use the term Gnosticism to indicate the ideas or coherent systems thatare characterised by an absolutely negative view of the visible world and itscreator and the assumption of a divine spark in man, his inner self, which hadbecome enclosed within the material body as the result of a tragic event in theprecosmic world, from which it can only escape to its divine origin by means ofthe saving Gnosis. These ideas are found in most of the original Gnosticwritings that have survived, for the greater part in the Nag Hammadi Library…Professor Roelof van den Broek, editor ofGnosis and Hermeticism From Antiquity to Modern Times There is no easy sound-bite description of what Gnosticism was, or is. As we'vealready had reason to note several times, the Gnostic tradition was one in whichspecial emphasis was placed on individual revelation and self-expression. Inconsequence, though it is true that a number of underlying themes, and evencertainties, were shared by all Gnostic sects, there was also a rich andconfusing proliferation of differences amongst them. Sects typically developedaround the teachings of inspired men – the most famous names from the first andsecond centuries AD include Simon Magus, Marcion, Basilides and Valentinus.Depending on the precise nature of the revelation of the founder, each sect thenadded its own speculations, metaphors and teaching-myths, sometimes evencomplete cosmological systems, to the vast and eclectic body of ideas andbehaviour already loosely categorised as ‘Gnosticism’.This background state of intellectual anarchy, coupled with the luxuriantmultiplication of ‘systems’ within Gnosticism, make the subject a daunting one.But the matter is even further complicated by the determined persecutionsinflicted on the Gnostics by the Christian Church between the fourth and thesixth centuries AD.1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en394] As well asthe holocausts of countless individuals, who were prepared to die terribledeaths rather than relinquish their faith, these persecutions resulted in thecollection and burning of huge numbers of Gnostic texts. In this way one of theprecious ‘hard disks’, on which was stored a vibrant portion of the intellectualand spiritual heritage of mankind, went up literally in smoke, leaving virtuallynothing behind for future generations to ponder over. The thoughts on the humancondition of inspired mystics and great philosophers, their journeys into theenigma of death, the liberating gnosis that they believed they had discovered ofthe true nature and purpose of our existence – all this seemed to have beenlost. For fifteen centuries those few scholars who still had any interest inlearning about this smashed and apparently forgotten religion were obliged todepend for their knowledge almost exclusively on the works of those responsiblefor smashing it in the first place. The heresy hunters would frequently quotepassages from suppressed Gnostic works, or report the content of those works insome detail, in order to preach against and attempt to refute them. But relyingon such one-sided material, even – or perhaps especially – in the choice oforiginal texts quoted, was almost bound to produce a very one-sidedunderstanding of Gnosticism. A roughly comparable exercise would be trying tobuild-up an accurate picture of Judaism from books written by Nazipropagandists.In the case of the latter we can ignore the Nazi trash because Judaism, unlikeGnosticism, is still a living religion and can speak for itself. But there hasbeen some good fortune too in the case of Gnosticism. The vast majority of itsscriptures were destroyed in the pogroms that the Christians unleashed. Buttowards the end of the fourth century AD an unknown group of heretics in UpperEgypt took the precaution of assembling a ‘time-capsule’ containing asubstantial collection of banned Gnostic texts. Possession of such texts, ifdetected, was extremely dangerous, so the ‘capsule’ – actually a largeearthenware jar – was buried in the ground, by the side of a great boulder, atthe foot of cliffs overlooking the ever-flowing Nile.Perhaps the owners hoped that things might improve and that they wouldeventually be able to return to collect their library. But they never did. It'svery likely that their heresy was detected and they were killed. During the lasttwo decades of the fourth century the dogmatic faction of Christianity that hadconverted Emperor Constantine years before was flexing its muscles under thefull protection of the Roman state. With tacit support from the localauthorities, and sometimes with direct military assistance,2[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en395] hysterical mobs of religiousfanatics and unkempt monks were on the loose in Egypt, spreading fear whereverthey went.3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en396] They vandalisedtemples that had stood for thousands of years in homage to the gods. Theydefaced ancient inscriptions. They murdered priests and philosophers. It wasunder their pressure that the sublime religion of ancient Egypt breathed itslast. However it was not ‘pagans’ that the Christian terrorists reserved theirworst excesses for. Much higher priority, and the greatest violence, wasfocussed on fellow Christians – heretics of the numerous Christian Gnostic sectsthat had been developing and multiplying in Egypt since the first century.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en397]It would have been the members of one such sect who buried the ‘time-capsule’beside the boulder at the foot of the cliffs. There it was to remain intact andundisturbed for nearly 1600 years while the life of Egypt, slowly changing, wenton around it.THE NAG HAMMADI LIBRARY: TIME CAPSULE OR TIME BOMB?In December 1945, near the modern town of Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt, a localfarmer named Muhammad Ali was clearing land at the edge of a field owned by hisfamily. By chance he exposed a large intact earthenware jar that had obviouslybeen purposefully buried in an upright position by the side of a boulder. Whenhe broke the jar open out spilled thirteen leather-bound papyrus books and alarge number of loose papyrus leaves. He brought the complete haul of pricelessknowledge about a long lost religion to his home where his mother put much ofthe loose-leaf material to use as kindling. But the books – codices is thecorrect term – survived and eventually found their way onto the black market inEgypt. Through good detective work the government's antiquities servicesucceeded in buying one and confiscating ten and a half of the thirteen codices.A large part of another was smuggled out of Egypt and offered for sale in theUS. Professor Gilles Quispel, an expert on Gnosticism at Utrecht University wasquickly able to certify to its importance and the codex was rescued.As Professor Quispel made a provisional translation of the text he found to hisastonishment that it seemed to be a Christian gospel but one previously unknownto him that did not appear anywhere in the New Testament. Its title was theGospel Of Thomas and it claimed to contain secret words spoken by Jesus to his‘twin’ – one Judas Thomas. The New Testament says nothing about Jesus having atwin .5 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en398]Despite the pages burnt by Muhammad Ali's mother a total of 52 separate textssurvived in the approximately twelve and a half salvaged codices. Directscientific tests on the papyrus used in their bindings, as well as linguisticanalysis of the Coptic script in which they are written, indicates that thecodices were manufactured between AD 350 and 400.6[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en399] The age of their content isanother matter since the texts themselves are translations into Coptic, thevernacular of Egypt in the early Christian age, of somewhat older source textsoriginally written in Greek. Scholars are in general agreement that the majorityof these were composed or compiled between AD 120 and 150.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en400] But it has been persuasivelyargued that the Gospel Of Thomas, at least, is an exception to this rule.Professor Helmut Koester of Harvard University has proposed that this hereticalgospel includes some content that may possibly be:… as early as the second half of the first century [AD 50 – 100] – as early, orearlier than Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en401]The date normally ascribed to the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament isin the range of AD 60 – 110.9 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en402] Butin the case of Thomas we're dealing with a banned text claiming to be a genuineChristian gospel that may also be genuinely older – i.e. nearer in time toChrist – than any of the canonical Gospels. This has to raise disturbingquestions about the canonical Gospels themselves. How canonical are they really?How can we be sure that they contain the truth, the whole truth and nothing butthe truth about Christ and the Christic phenomenon? The existence of this‘elder’ gospel in the Nag Hammadi collection suggests that Matthew, Mark, Lukeand John may have been part of a much wider literature that was at some point‘edited out’ of the New Testament. That impression is enhanced by the inclusionof several other heretical gospels amongst the 52 Nag Hammadi texts – the Gospelof Philip, the Gospel of Truth and the Gospel to the Egyptians. Were thereothers still that Muhammad Ali's mother burnt? Or that didn't make it into theprecious Nag Hammadi time capsule and were erased from history by the heresyhunters?THE ORGANISATION (1): HINTS OF A GNOSTIC SECRET SOCIETYThere is much more that is disturbing about the texts of the Nag Hammadilibrary. Remember that they were composed mainly between the first and thirdcenturies AD, originally in Greek, translated into Coptic some time later, andfinally concealed during the late fourth century. We've noted that this was atime when the newly Christianised empire of Rome was beginning to turn all itsresources against Christian heretics – particularly, and most savagely, againstthe Gnostics. It is intriguing, therefore, that several of the Nag Hammadidocuments make allusions to the existence of something very much like a secretsociety, usually referred to as the ‘Organisation’. 10[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en403] Part of its mission, which we willreturn to in later chapters, is to build monuments ‘as a representation of thespiritual places’ (i.e. the stars).11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en404] It is also to use every meanspossible, including guile and stealth, to protect the sacred knowledge ofGnosticism and to oppose the universal forces of darkness and ignorance that aresaid to have:Steered the people who followed them into great troubles, by leading them astraywith many deceptions. They became old without having enjoyment. They died nothaving found truth and without knowing the God of Truth. And thus the wholecreation became enslaved forever from the foundations of the world until now.12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en405]The Gnostic religion revealed by the Nag Hammadi texts is unambiguouslydualistic. It starkly envisages two potent spiritual forces at work in thefullness of all existence: the God of Light, Love and Goodness, and the God ofDarkness, Hate and Evil. As with the Bogomils and the Cathars a millenniumlater, the Gnostics believed that it was the latter – the God of Evil – who hadconstructed the material universe and created human bodies. Our souls, however,were from the spiritual realm of the God of Good and yearned to return there. Aprimary purpose of the God of Evil was to frustrate this desire and keep theselost souls imprisoned forever on the earth – to ‘make them drink the water offorgetfulness … in order that they might not know from whence they came.’13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en406] The evil powers worked toanaesthetise intelligence and spread the cancer of ‘mind blindness’14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en407] because:Ignorance is the mother of all evil … Ignorance is a slave. Knowledge isfreedom.15 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en408]By contrast the Nag Hammadi texts make it clear that the ‘Organisation’ servesthe spiritual forces of Light. Its sacred purpose is to free human beings fromtheir state of enslavement by initiating them into the cult of knowledge. Therecould hardly be a more important or more urgent task: in the Gnostic viewmankind is the focus, or fulcrum, of a cosmic struggle; individual choices forevil, arising out of ignorance, therefore have ramifications far beyond themerely material and mortal and human plane. 16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en409] For these reasons the Gnosticssaid ‘Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the world rulersof this darkness and the spirits of wickedness.’17[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en410]THE PUBLIC CRAFTSMANIn Alexandria, one of their prime centres, the Gnostics lived in close contactwith the last vestiges of the ancient Egyptian religion, and also co-existedwith Judaism and early Christianity. They honoured Christ. And in precisely thesame way as the later Cathars and Bogomils (as well as the Manicheans andPaulicians) they did not believe him to have been born in the flesh but favouredthe apparition or ‘phantasm’ theory.Evidence from Alexandria suggests that the Gnostic communities there during thefirst three centuries after Christ also honoured Osiris, the ancient Egyptiangod of rebirth,18 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en411] ‘who standsbefore darkness as a guardian of the Light’.19[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en412] This was not a cult shared by anyof the other post-Christian dualist groups.On the other hand – once again like the Manicheans, Messalians, Paulicians,Cathars and Bogomils – the Gnostics saw Jehovah, the Old Testament God of theJews and Christians, as a dark force, indeed as one of the ‘world rulers ofdarkness’. He was to them the evil demiurge – a Greek term, somewhat derogatory,that means, literally, ‘public craftsman’ .20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en413] In other words he was a low-classsub-deity who had created the earth as his personal fief (rather like an odd-jobman with a hobby), placed the human race upon it to worship and adore him, anddeluded the poor creatures into believing that he was the only God in existence.His sole purpose for us, therefore, was to keep us enchained in spiritualignorance and darkness for all eternity and enmesh us in acts of evil that wouldmake us truly his forever. For this reason the account given in the Nag Hammaditexts of the ‘temptation’ of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden depicts theserpent not as the villain of the piece, as the Old Testament book of Genesisportrays him, but rather as the hero and true benefactor of mankind:‘What did God say to you?’ the Serpent asked Eve. ‘Was it “Do not eat from thetree of knowledge” [gnosis]’ ? She replied: ‘He said, “Not only do not eat from it, but do not touch it lestyou die”.’ The serpent reassured her, saying, ‘Do not be afraid.With death you shall not die; for it was out of jealousy that he said this toyou. Rather your eyes shall open and you shall come to be like gods, recognisingevil and good.’21 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en414]After Adam and Eve had eaten of the tree of knowledge, the Gnostics taught thatthey experienced enlightenment, awoke to their own luminous nature and coulddistinguish good from evil, just as the serpent had promised. Seeing theirintellectual and spiritual transformation the demiurge was jealous and rousedhis demonic companions:‘Behold, Adam! He has come to be like one of us, so that he knows the differencebetween the light and the darkness. Now perhaps he also will come to the tree oflife and eat from it and become immortal. Come let us expel him from Paradisedown to the land from which he was taken, so that henceforth he might not beable to recognise anything better.’ And so they expelled Adam from Paradise, along with his wife .22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en415]What stands out in this Gnostic Genesis story is the way in which Adam and Eveare expelled from ‘Paradise’ down to the ‘land’ – where henceforth they are tolive in ignorance of their true potential. The underlying concept of a descentfrom a spiritual paradise into a fleshly and material world is extremely closeto the Bogomil and Cathar notion of angels falling from heaven to earth toinhabit human bodies. In both cases the predicament of the soul is the same –trapped in matter, forgetful of its true nature, unmindful of its divinepotential, deluded by the wiles of an Evil God, and carried in a frame (thebody) that is subject to every whim of that supernatural monster.The Gnostic texts continue with their version of the book of Genesis telling thestory of human history on earth after the ‘Fall’. Time passes and we read howthe descendants of Adam and Eve achieved a high state of development,manipulating the physical world with clever machines and devices and beginningto engage in profound spiritual inquiries. Out of jealousy the demiurgeintervenes again to diminish human potential, calling out to his demonic powers:‘Come, let us cause a deluge with our hands and obliterate all flesh, from manto beast.’23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en416]According to the Gnostics, the Flood was not inflicted to punish evil – as theOld Testament falsely informs us – but to punish humanity for having risen sohigh and ‘to take the light’ that was growing amongst men. 24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en417] The devastation of the Flood allbut achieved this objective. Although there were survivors, they were thrown:… into great distraction and into a life of toil, so that mankind might beoccupied by worldly affairs, and might not have the opportunity of being devotedto the holy spirit .25 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en418]But fortunately there were a few amongst our ancestors who still possessed theold knowledge, and who were determined to pass it down for the benefit of futuregenerations, for as long as necessary, wherever possible, until such a time as ageneral awakening might occur again .26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en419]THE ‘ORGANISATION’ (2): A REAWAKENING IN THE 10TH CENTURY?We could not help wondering how the mysterious ‘Organisation’ spoken of in theNag Hammadi texts would have reacted to the persecutions being unleashed onGnosticism when the texts were sealed away near the end of the fourth centuryAD. Might its members not have been inclined to see themselves in the samemythical framework as the Flood survivors of the Gnostic creation legends? Ofcourse they were not dealing this time with a literal ‘flood’ sent by thediabolical God of the Old Testament to steal the light of mankind. But from theGnostic point of view what they confronted was at least equally dangerous – theinvestigations of the heresy hunters, the random violence of Christian mobs, theburnings of books and people.The Nag Hammadi texts invite us to consider the possibility that a secretsociety, purposefully set up to secure and preserve Gnostic teachings throughperiods of difficulty, had been in existence at least between the first andthird centuries AD (when the texts were composed). If such an ‘Organisation’still remained active until the time when the texts were buried then there isevery possibility that it could have survived the holocausts of the fourth tothe sixth centuries. Even without such obvious shelters and vectors as theMessalians and the Manicheans, it would not have been too difficult for a smalland dedicated sect of heretics to have maintained a clandestine existence and tohave continued to recruit new members through the Dark Ages between the sixthand the tenth centuries. There is no particular reason, if it was discrete, whyit should have attracted much attention or ever been recognised for what it was.There were many remote religious communities of hermits or monks that could haveprovided it with suitable camouflage until such a time as it chose to step outof the shadows again.And what better or more auspicious time for Gnosticism to step out of theshadows and make another bid to establish a world religion than the finalcentury of the first millennium? This was precisely the moment – somewherebetween AD 920 – 970 as we saw in Chapter Three – that the heresiarch who calledhimself Bogomil, ‘Beloved of God’, began to preach so persuasively in Bulgaria.We know already that the Church he founded had ambitions to achieve a generalawakening. We've seen how its influence spread with great rapidity and success,first in territories under the spiritual hegemony of the Eastern OrthodoxChurch, and later in areas such as northern Italy and Occitania that were underthe control of the Roman Catholic Church.On both fronts the absolute dominance of what was by then thought to beestablished Christianity was challenged with a doctrine in many respectsidentical to that of the early Christian Gnostics.And on both fronts the challenger claimed to be the original church of Christwhose rightful place had been usurped by the incumbent.GNOSTICS, BOGOMILS AND CATHARS: MUCH IN COMMON (1)Gnosticism is thought by many scholars to have been a late pre-Christianphilosophical religion that insinuated itself like a virus into earlyChristianity and attempted to transform it into a vehicle for propagating itsown ideas – hence ‘Christian Gnosticism’. On the same evidence that they offer,however, it is equally possible to argue that the Christian cult was Gnostic inorigin but was later hijacked by a group of hard-headed scriptural literalistswho turned it to their own ends. Either way most authorities point to Palestinein the first century BC as the birthplace of Gnosticism; from there, they say,it spread rapidly to Alexandria which was to become the main centre for itssubsequent expansion .27 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en420]During that epoch, though they had very different backgrounds, Palestine andAlexandria shared the common Hellenistic culture that had prevailed throughoutthe Mediterranean, Mesopotamia and Iran since the conquests of Alexander theGreat in the fourth century BC. This had been – and indeed continued for sometime to be – a period of extraordinary vivacity, intellectual endeavour,creativity, rationality and intense spirituality. It brought together in onegigantic Hellenistic melting pot the priests of ancient Egypt, the dualist Magiof Iran, initiates of the mysteries of Mithras, Platonic philosophers fromGreece, Jewish mystics, Buddhist missionaries and a host of other influencesfrom near and far. It was somewhere in that ‘confused but thrilling encounter,’suggests historian Joscelyn Godwin, that ‘Gnosticism was born, the religion ofGnosis – knowledge of the true nature of things.’28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en421]There are certain fundamental elements of Gnosticism. Of these the mostimportant is the notion that there exists an entirely spiritual, light-filledrealm that is ruled by a benevolent and loving ‘Good God’, but that the materialrealm in which we live is the creation of an ‘Evil God’. As we've seen, theexploits of Jehovah in the Old Testament served the Gnostics very well asillustrations of this idea during the first and second centuries AD. He hadcreated the world, the Bible said, and his actions were also almost invariablywicked, mean-spirited, jealous, violent and cruel – exactly what one wouldexpect of an Evil God. It cannot be an accident that we find the identical usageof Jehovah in identical contexts for identical purposes by the Cathars andBogomils between the 10th and 14th centuries.Another hint that these groups at opposite ends of the first millennium musthave been closely linked comes when we remember that all of them believed oursouls to have been created by the Good God and to belong in the good realm whileour bodies were part of the evil material creation. Gnostics, Cathars andBogomils all likewise regarded the soul as a prisoner in the demonic materialworld where it was in constant danger of being dragged ever deeper and trappedever more firmly. All three of them offered it a way of escape (from what wouldotherwise be eternal confinement) by means of initiation into their system andacquisition of the gnosis that they had to teach.In all three cases this gnosis appears to have involved an absolutely convincingand probably instantaneous insight into the miserable situation of the soul, thetrue nature of matter, and the escape route that Gnosticism offered. In allthree cases Christ was seen not as a redeemer (who died to expiate our sins) butas an emanation of the divine who had descended to open men's eyes to their truepredicament. Last but not least, although all three groups treated the advent ofChrist as a cosmic event of enormous importance, all three also believed that hehad never incarnated in the flesh, that his body was an apparition, and that hisCrucifixion was therefore an illusion.GNOSTICS, BOGOMILS AND CATHARS: MUCH IN COMMON (2)The Gnostic religion of the first four centuries of the first millennium, andthe Bogomil and Cathar religions of the first four centuries of the secondmillennium, shared many other intimate details. We've already seen in ChapterThree how the consolamentum ritual of the latter, which raised the candidatefrom the status of credente to the status of perfectus, was essentiallyidentical to the ritual of adult baptism in the early church which raised thecandidate to the status of a fully initiated Christian. The irony, as StevenRunciman points out, is that:While polemical churchmen in the Middle Ages denounced the heretics formaintaining a class of the Elect or Perfect they were denouncing an EarlyChristian practice, and the heretic initiation ceremony [the consolamentum] thatthey viewed with so much horror was almost word for word the ceremony with whichEarly Christians were admitted to the Church … 29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en422] Such similarity cannot befortuitous. Obviously the Cathar Church had preserved, only slightly amended tosuit its doctrines of the time, the services extant in the Christian Churchduring the first four centuries of its life.30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en423]What is now clear is that the services used by the early church were, in origin,almost exclusively the services of early Christian Gnosticism.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en424] They were deleted and replaced asthe literalist Christian faction in Rome consolidated its power during the forthand fifth centuries. But it was natural that the banned rituals would continueto be practiced and preserved by surviving Gnostic sects. Some of these havebeen named in the provisional chain of transmission we sketched out in ChapterFour. But it's likely that many more lived on in secret either in remotecommunities or by ‘veiling’ themselves inside the organisations of theirreligious competitors.Although all this sounds very cloak-and-dagger it is accepted by historians thatmany Gnostic and dualist sects were extremely secretive in their behaviour.Understandably, they became adept at concealing themselves from authorities whowould burn them. We have cited examples in previous chapters of ‘nests ofheretics’ – Bogomils and Cathars – being exposed within both Eastern Orthodoxand Roman Catholic monasteries during the 10th to 14th centuries. It issignificant, and even suggestive of a ‘standard operating procedure’, thatveiling of exactly the same sort was also used by the heretics of the fourth andfifth centuries when Gnosticism was being persecuted. Indeed it is most likelythat the unknown group of Gnostics who concealed the Nag Hammadi library werethemselves Christian monks. At that time two monasteries of the supposedlyOrthodox Pachomian order stood within six miles of the spot where the codiceswere buried.32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en425]The initiation ritual of the consolamentum served at least two major functionsin the religion of the Cathars and Bogomils.First, through a chain of direct contact, which they claimed stretched unbrokenall the way back to the apostles, the laying on of hands transferred the powerof the Holy Spirit. As the jolt of sacred energy washed over him, they believedthat the candidate's eyes were opened – in an instant – to the full predicamentof his soul, separated from its true heavenly home, imprisoned in the realm ofan Evil God. What that flash of enlightenment really gave him, in his belief,was the complete knowledge and spiritual power needed to break the bonds ofmatter and return his soul to heaven.Professor Roelof van den Broek of Utrecht University has made an argument thatthe consolamentum was not a truly ‘Gnostic’ initiation because no ‘special kindof Gnosis’ was transferred by the ritual.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en426] The professor is an authority inhis field, whose work we highly respect. But this statement requires anoverly-restrictive definition of the kind of ‘knowledge’ that gnosis was, andgives no thought as to how it was supposedly acquired. As we've already noted,the Gnostic initiation rituals of the first to the fourth centuries AD, justlike the initiations of the Bogomils and Cathars a thousand years later, weresimple ceremonies involving the laying on of hands. It is absolutely obviousthat what descended on the candidate in all three cases was not a specific bodyof learning to be mastered intellectually either through an oral tradition orfrom books. It was, instead, revealed knowledge, inspired knowledge, whichpassed in an instant like a charge of electricity and which he or she had toexperience directly and personally. In essence it was not even complicated ordifficult knowledge. As Bernard Hamilton maintains, the early Christian Gnosticssaw it simply as ‘knowledge of the truth about the human condition.’34[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en427] As such you either got it, or youdidn't.Besides, despite his reservations about full Gnostic status for theconsolamentum, van den Broek himself goes on to affirm:Because of their dualism, be it moderate or absolute, the Cathars can be calledGnostics. If the idea that the material world is made by an evil creator andthat the soul is locked up in the prison of the body cannot be called Gnostic,then there are no Gnostic ideas at all. In this sense Catharism is a medievalform of Gnosticism.35 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en428]The second function of the consolamentum for the Cathars and the Bogomils was toelevate the candidate from the rank of credente to the rank of perfectus. Inthis too they were following a pattern that had been set down by ChristianGnostics in the first four centuries AD. We've already seen that the Manicheans,in exactly the same way as the Cathars and Bogomils, divided themselves into twogreat classes of elect and hearers. So too did an earlier Gnostic Churchestablished by Valentinus in the second century AD. He divided his ‘goodChristians’ into two classes – the pneumatics (‘spirituals’, ‘full ofdivinity’36 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en429]) and the psychics(those with the potential, through effort, to become spirituals).37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en430] Marcion, another charismaticheretic of the second century AD, used the same system in the influential andsuccessful Gnostic Church established in his name.38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en431] As was the case with the Catharand Bogomil perfecti, severe austerities, fasts, vegetarianism and chastity werethe domain of the pneumatics only. As was the case with the Cathar and Bogomilcredentes, the psychics were free of such obligations but had a duty to carefor, worship and protect the pneumatics.39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en432]GNOSTICS, BOGOMILS AND CATHARS: MUCH IN COMMON (3)Another matter which changed not at all between the 4th century and the 13thcentury was the peculiarly consistent and cruel manner in which people who heldto the Gnostic and dualist perspective were punished by the Church. When youconsider what is involved for the victim of a burning at the stake it is obviousthat no rational person would choose such a death lightly. So the very fact thatso many initiated Gnostics actually chose to die in this awful manner – ratherthan abjure their beliefs – and that so many Cathar perfecti did the same amillennium later, tells us, at the very least, how deeply all these men andwomen must have been convinced that they were right. Whether they were deludingthemselves or not is another matter – and one that is impossible to settle withcertainty in this life. But we cannot doubt that they were absolutely certainabout what would happen to their souls after they had passed through the ordealof the flames.As well as having much in common with each other, Gnosticism and the laterreligion of the Bogomils and Cathars also share one striking characteristic withestablished Christianity. They are all ‘Salvationist’ faiths – i.e. they allprovide a system, and they promise that if it is followed it will ‘save’ thesouls of its adherents. Yet even here, when we look closer, we discover that theCathars, Bogomils and Gnostics stand together on one side of a line while theguardians of established Christianity stand on the other. This is because thedoctrine of Catholicism and of the Eastern Orthodox Church might best be summedup as ‘salvation through faith alone’ – blind faith being all that is required.Whereas what the heretics were all offering was salvation through knowledge –revealed knowledge, inspired knowledge, saving knowledge – that was experienceddirectly by the initiate.Whether a delusion or not, it was on account of this personal knowledge of whatawaited them after death – and nothing else – that the Gnostic and Catharheretics endured the flames with such calm certainty.PONTIFEX MAXIMUSThe Roman Catholic Church did not invent burning at the stake as a punishmentfor heresy but took over the idea intact from long centuries of Roman tradition.Since the reign of Augustus Caesar (27 BC – AD 14) all the emperors, in additionto their other responsibilities, had held the office of Pontifex Maximus – thetitle of the ancient high-priest of the state religion of Rome .40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en433] The religion could (and did)change from emperor to emperor, but the emperor of the day always remained itsPontifex Maximus. In order to maintain the mandate of heaven he was required toprotect the state religion and punish any attempts to undermine it. This did notconcern most creeds, which went about their business peacefully and weretolerated. But it did affect militant evangelistic religious movements like theChristians and the Manicheans which offered a perceptible threat to thedominance of the state cult, and thus to the state itself. Very frequently theoffenders were charged with heresy and burnt at the stake.In 186 BC a mystery cult dedicated to the god Dionysos was banned in Rome andthousands of its initiates executed.41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en434] On another occasion ‘philosophers’were burnt for threatening the proper conduct of religion. Witnesses said theywent to the stake ‘laughing at the sudden collapse of human destinies’ and died‘unmoving in the flames’.42 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en435] Athousand years later when the persecutions began in the Languedoc, Catharperfecti were repeatedly seen to do the same.The Roman historian Tacitus records a terrible massacre of Christians during thereign of Emperor Nero (AD 54 – 68). However, this seems to have had less to dowith protecting the state cult than with popular hatred of the Christians atthat time. Already despised for ‘their abominations’ they were wrongly blamedfor starting the great fire that devastated Rome in AD 64:An arrest was first made of all who confessed; then, upon hearing theirconfessions, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of arson but ofhatred of the human race. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths.Covered with the skins of beasts they were torn apart by dogs, nailed tocrosses, or doomed to the flames. Those who were burned were used to illuminethe night-time skies when daylight ended.43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en436]It was to be almost 200 years before there were systematic persecutions ofChristians by the Roman emperor in his role as Pontifex Maximus. Decius was thefirst of these when he punished Christians who failed to offer animal sacrificesto the pagan gods in AD 250. There were further martyrdoms under Valerian in AD257 – 9,44 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en437] and in AD 303 – 5Diocletian launched separate pogroms against Christians and Manicheans.45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en438] Diocletian's Rescript on theManichees ordered the leaders of that sect burnt at the stake together withtheir most persistent followers. He accused them of committing many crimes,disturbing quiet populations and even working ‘the greatest harm to wholecities.’ Making clear why to be a Manichean was to be a heretic, he wrote:It is indeed highly criminal to discuss doctrines once and for all settled anddefined by our forefathers, and which have their recognised place and course inour system. Wherefore we are resolutely determined to punish the stubborndepravity of these worthless people.46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en439]In other words Dicoletian was burning those poor Manichean elect because theydisagreed with established religious doctrines and dogmas. The tone of hisRescript is eerily similar to papal pronouncements of the 13th century callingdown the Albigensian Crusades upon the Cathars of the Languedoc.As to the Roman persecution of the Christians, authors Timothy Freke and PeterGandy have made the valid point that ‘in its whole history … Christianity wasofficially persecuted for a total of five years .’47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en440] This is not the impression givento children brought up in the Western Christian tradition who are led to imaginecenturies of sustained persecution. The truth is that there were a few isolatedincidents between AD 50 and 250 followed by a few years of – admittedly – awfultortures, again frequently involving burning at the stake, but also scorching inred-hot iron chairs, scourging, ‘the frying pan’(! ), and consumption by wildbeasts.48 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en441]Such torments ended for the Christians when their champion Constantine the Greatdefeated his rivals at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in AD 312 and became thesenior ruler of Rome's cruel and violent empire.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en442] He immediately extended statetolerance to Christianity. This, however, did not mean that the powers of thePontifex Maximus, which he continued to hold in his hands as emperor, were doneaway with. It simply meant that in future – with the notable exception of thereign of Emperor Julian the Apostate (AD 332 – 63 ) – these powers would nolonger be used against Christians. It was not until AD 380 under EmperorTheodosius50 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en443] that Roman CatholicChristianity was adopted as the state religion (while other forms ofChristianity were denounced as ‘demented and insane’).51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en444] So this technically was the momentwhen Catholicism formally acquired the right to be protected by the emperor inhis capacity as Pontifex Maximus. But it had long previously been given carteblanche by Constantine himself to persecute its internal enemies – the heretics.THE FIRST STEP ON THE ROAD TO THE STAKEEven by Roman standards Constantine the Great was not a nice man. He had hiseldest son Crispus executed (while the latter was en route to attendcelebrations with him) and his wife Fausta locked in an overheated steam roomand poached to death!52 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en445] He did notin fact become a baptised Christian until hours before his death, thus allowinghimself considerable latitude for cruelty, excess and wickedness along the way.Indeed it is reported that one of the principal reasons for his adoption ofChristianity (other than his ‘miraculous’ success at Milvian Bridge, which isanother story) had been that it alone amongst the religions of Rome had promisedhim expiation of his many sins. Apparently the priests of the pagan temples,horrified even to be asked for expiation by such a brute, had refused him.53[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en446]So it seems that Constantine, who had good reason to worry about the afterlifedestiny of his soul, owed a very large debt to the Christian bishops. Bygranting them state tolerance in 312 – 313 he repaid part of it. But he was apolitician with an eye to his constituencies. Despite much urging he thereforerefused to abolish or interfere in any way with the freedom of religion of themany other popular and powerfully-supported faiths in the empire. Defending thevery same policy of tolerance from which Christianity had just benefited, hereminded the bishops:It is one thing to undertake the contest for immortality voluntarily, another tocompel it with punishment.54 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en447]This was a matter on which Constantine remained consistent throughout his life –with one exception. That exception was announced in an edict (circa 324 – 326).In it he attacked the ‘venomous errors’ of Christian heretics, confiscated theirproperties and initiated other persecutions. The wording of the edict has beenpreserved for us by Constantine's fawning biographer, the eminent church fatherEusebius. It is worth quoting it at some length:Be it known to you by this present decree, you Novatians,55[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en448] Valentinians, Marcionites [thelatter, two well-known Gnostic sects], Paulians and those called Cataphrygians,all in short who constitute the heresies by your private assemblies, how manyare the falsehoods in which your idle folly is entangled, and how venomous thepoisons with which your teaching is involved, so that the healthy are brought tosickness and the living to everlasting death through you. You opponents oftruth, enemies of life and counsellors of ruin! Everything about you is contraryto truth, in harmony with ugly deeds of evil; it serves grotesque charades inwhich you argue falsehoods, distress the unoffending, deny light to believers … The crimes done by you are so great and immense, so hateful and full ofharshness, that not even a whole day would suffice to put them into words; andin any case it is proper to shut the ears and avert the eyes, so as not toimpair the pure and untarnished commitment of our own faith by recounting thedetails. Why then should we endure such evils any longer? Protracted neglectallows healthy people to be infected as with an epidemic disease. Why do we notimmediately use severe public measures to dig up such a great evil, as you mightsay, by the roots? Accordingly, since it is no longer possible to tolerate the pernicious effect ofyour destructiveness, by this decree we publicly command that none of youhenceforward shall dare to assemble. Therefore we have also given order that allyour buildings in which you conduct these meetings … not only in public but alsoin houses of individuals or any private places … are to be confiscated … andhanded over incontestably and without delay to the Catholic Church … andthereafter no opportunity be left for you to meet so that from this day forwardyour unlawful groups may not dare to assemble in any place either public orprivate.56 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en449]It was the first step on the slippery slope of persecution. Within less than acentury, in league with emperors like Theodosius, the Catholic Church had begunto burn heretics at the stake …WHEN COERCION WAS LEARNTH. A. Drake, professor of history at the University of California, thinks thatConstantine's out-of-character initiative against the heretics in AD 324 – 6 wasalmost certainly the result of pressure from the bishops57[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en450] – i.e. that the emperor was payingoff another instalment of his spiritual debt to them. Besides, looking at hisoptions at the time, it would have seemed like the obvious move to make:With heresy, both imperial and episcopal agendas came together. Punishment ofimproper worship was the one action that Constantine would have been prepared bycenturies of imperial procedure to take, and the one that, in his eyes, a newand important constituency had the most right to demand. It had the additionaladvantage of demonstrating his toughness to militant Christians at very littlecost.58 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en451]Drake has investigated Christianity's rise to power in Rome and its changingrelationships with the state between Constantine's initial acceptance of thefaith in AD 312, its elevation as the official religion of the empire in AD 380,and the banning of all other faiths in AD 392.59[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en452] This was a period of immenseimportance for the future of Christianity in which – for good or ill – it setthe course that it has followed ever since. It was also the period, as Drakeobserves, in which ‘militant Christians first came to dominate and then todefine the Christian movement.’60 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en453]Noting that in the decades after Constantine the Church ‘became more militantand more coercive as it became more powerful’ he asks: ‘What happened to theChristian movement, why was it that the militant wing prevailed?’61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en454]During the first three centuries AD we know already that the ‘Christianmovement’ consisted of a diverse mass of sects, all of which defined themselvesas followers of Christ despite their wildly varying doctrines and contradictorybeliefs.At one end of the scale there were those like the Gnostics who rejected the OldTestament, interpreted the New Testament allegorically within a dualistframework, did not believe that Christ had been born in the flesh (orcrucified), allowed the greatest possible latitude for individual revelation andinspiration, and had no wish to impose dogma on others. Although they claimed tobe the original Christians, guarding the true apostolic succession, they wereinterested not in coercion but in a process of personal enquiry and experiencethat would lead their initiates to a saving knowledge of the truth. They did notbelieve that there was just one exclusive path to this gnosis. As such, blindobedience to any form of dogma, together with intolerance for the beliefs ofothers, were rejected by all the Gnostic systems.At the other end of the scale were Drake's ‘militant Christians’, the Catholicsand their bishops who established their primary power centre in Rome in theearly fourth century AD after they had won Constantine's favour. They tooclaimed to be the original Christians, guarding the true apostolic succession,and it was on the exclusive basis of their doctrines and beliefs that what wenow think of as the ‘Christian Church’ took shape during the decades thatfollowed. They accepted the Old Testament, interpreted the New Testament withadamant literalism, believed in Christ's incarnation, crucifixion and bodilyresurrection (and that all humans would experience bodily resurrection too),rejected dualism, allowed no latitude whatsoever for individual revelation andinspiration, and felt it was their duty to impose their beliefs on others. Theirinterest was in obtaining the complete and unquestioning faith of theircongregations in the infallibility of the doctrines that they taught. As such,dogma, the enforcement of blind obedience, and violent intolerance for thebeliefs of others, were, from the beginning, their stock in trade.Why did the militant wing prevail? The answer that Drake gives to his ownquestion is in a sense a tautology. The militant wing of the once broad churchof Christianity prevailed because it was militant and because it was the firstto acquire access to the coercive apparatus of the state. As a simple anduniversal function of human organisation, Drake suggests:… there are persons in every mass movement who are willing to coexist withvariant beliefs and others who see such non-believers as outsiders and as athreat that must be neutralised.62 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en455]If coercive powers are made available to people who cannot tolerate variantbeliefs, as they were in Rome in the fourth century, then it is inevitable thatthey will soon be used to enforce uniformity by destroying or marginalisingother religions. But because of Constantine's calculated squeamishness aboutpersecuting pagans, the dogmatic tendencies of the Catholic bishops during theirfirst few decades in imperial favour were channelled exclusively into the fightagainst heresy. This was a fight that the Church was subsequently to pursue withsingle-minded ferocity during the 13th and 14th centuries when it destroyed theCathars and until as late as the 17th century when heretics throughout Europewere still routinely burnt at the stake. Indeed it may well be that it was onlythrough this early process of discriminating against, stigmatising, punishing,terrorising, and physically eliminating internal rivals that the members of themilitant faction of Christianity were able to elucidate their own beliefs fullyin the first place. ‘The existence of heresy cannot be considered apart from theexistence of the Church itself,’ argues Zoé Oldenbourg:The two run pari passu. Dogma is always accompanied by heresy; from the veryfirst, the history of the Christian Church was a long catalogue of battlesagainst various heresies.63 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en456]Thus what had started out as Constantine's ‘low-cost’ strategy to appeasemilitant Christians, to whom he felt indebted, and to impose uniformity on themore heterodox Christian sects (something that would have appealed to thedictatorial instincts of any red-blooded Roman emperor) was to have unforeseenconsequences that rebounded down the ages. Before Constantine there had been aneclectic field of Christians in which no sect held power over any other –because all were persecuted. After Constantine the field was rapidly transformedand polarised. On one side, clustered around a literal interpretation of thescriptures, were the bishops of the Catholic Church – the militants whom theemperor wanted to appease. On the other side was everyone else and every othershade of opinion. The net effect, after AD 324 – 6, was that all anyone neededto do to become a ‘heretic’, and to risk losing freedom of assembly, home,property and life, was to disagree publicly with the infallible pronouncementsof the bishops – most particularly the supreme bishop of the Church of Rome. Itis not an accident that by the 380s the emperors had renounced their age-oldresponsibility of Pontifex Maximus – high-priest of the Roman state religion –leaving it for the popes to pick up.64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en457]To this day it remains their official title.65[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en458]LONGING FOR POWER LONG BEFORE CONSTANTINEWe are not suggesting that militant literalism within the Christian Church wascreated by Constantine's willingness to punish heretics. On the contrary astrong literalist tendency had been present in Christianity long before thefourth century – perhaps as long as any of the Gnostic sects – and simply tookadvantage of this willingness. The really radical transformation ofConstantine's reign was that for the first time it gave literalists the power toimpose their views on others.It's obvious with hindsight that they'd been longing for this for centuries.It's obvious, too, how they consistently made use of rabble-rousing emotionalarguments and hateful accusations during their years in waiting simply to stirup trouble for their opponents – sophisticated techniques that moderndisinformation specialists would call black propaganda. Everything about theirdemeanour and rhetoric indicates that these people believed they would one daygain the power of enforcement over others – as they eventually did underConstantine – and that once they had it they would not hesitate to use it.Consider, for example, the words of Irenaeus, one of the Catholic Church's greatscourges of Christian Gnostics during the second century:Let those who blaspheme the Creator … as [do] the Valentinians and all thefalsely so-called Gnostics, be recognised as agents of Satan by all who worshipGod. Through their agency Satan even now … has been seen to speak against God,that God who has prepared eternal fire for every kind of apostacy.66[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en459]From the first to the fourth centuries there are repeated examples of this sortof rhetoric, often wound up to an even higher pitch and including accusations ofcannibalism, sexual promiscuity, infant sacrifice and so on. Another tellingdetail is that even before Gnosticism was banned, techniques were in use to‘flush out’ and identify its initiates for possible future persecution. Becausethe Gnostic perfecti were generally vegetarian, one well-tried method ofidentifying their presence amongst the orthodox clergy and monks of Egypt was tomake meat-eating compulsory for all once a week.67[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en460]It is the victors who write history, not the losers; so we don't know whethersuch witch-hunts and hate campaigns had begun to spark off physical violenceagainst the Gnostics as early as the second century. But the Gnostics’ side ofthe story may have survived in one of the Nag Hammadi texts, the Second Treatiseof the Great Seth, which says in part:After we went forth from our home, and came down to this world, and came intobeing in the world in bodies, we were hated and persecuted, not only by thosewho are ignorant [pagans], but also by those who think they are advancing thename of Christ, since they were unknowingly empty, not knowing who they are,like dumb animals.68 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en461]MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTSConstantine's edict of AD 324 – 6, cited at length earlier, handed the militantChristians the one thing they'd obviously wanted all along – the power of thestate to persecute their old opponents, the Gnostics. It is notable that theedict is expressed in the peculiarly violent rhetoric favoured by the militants.As Drake points out it was a very deliberate choice of words when the emperorcharacterised the beliefs of Gnostics as ‘venomous’ – a term comparing those whoheld them to snakes. Similarly:… he likens heresy to a disease, something capable of infecting healthy souls.Such images are important as labels that serve both to identify and stigmatise agroup, making it easier to single out its members and deny them humane treatment… This step, however limited in scope and duration, opened the door for the moremassive coercion campaigns that would occur at the end of the century. 69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en462]During the last decade of Constantine's rule the evidence shows, as expected,that militants began to use the new powers he had given them;70[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en463] but they did so quite tentativelyat first – as though feeling out the opposition. Under the reigns of his sonsthey became significantly more persecuting.71[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en464] During the 15 years that EmperorTheodosius was on the throne (AD 379 – 395) he outdid all his predecessors bypassing more than 100 new laws aimed at the Gnostics – laws that deprived themof their property, their liberty and frequently their lives, confiscated theirplaces of assembly and commanded the destruction of their books .72[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en465] It is unlikely to be a coincidencethat this was the precise period in which the codices of the Nag Hammadi librarywere hidden away in Upper Egypt to escape detection and destruction. And thoughrecords are incomplete, we know that there was also state sponsorship ofanti-heretical terrorism during the same period in Lower Egypt.Maternus Cynegius, Theodosius's governor in Alexandria from AD 384 – 388 wasrenowned for his relentless harrassment and persecution of heretics andpagans.73 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en466] In that greatcosmopolitan city, one of the first strongholds of Gnosticism, a localsyncretistic and universalising cult dedicated to the composite deity Serapis (afusion of two ancient Egyptian gods, Osiris and Apis) had long enjoyed thepatronage of people from many different social and religious backgrounds.Scholars believe that Christian Gnostics may have participated in the mysteriesof Osiris in his Serapis incarnation ‘while professing to place upon what theysaw there a Christian interpretation.’74[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en467] It is also notable that several ofthe Alexandrian Gnostic sects made direct use of figures of Serapis – generallydepicted as robed and bearded in the Greek rather than Egyptian style – as asymbol of the God of Goodness .75 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en468]Such flexibility and open-mindedness in the search for spiritual truths had beencharacteristic of Alexandria since its foundation some seven centuriespreviously. But precisely because of this venerable tradition of tolerance andfusion many of its citizens were shocked, and then outraged, when Cynegius beganto put the military forces he commanded as governor – supposedly for theprotection of all sections of the community – at the disposal of the Catholiccampaign to abolish other religions .76[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en469]In 391, three years after Cynegius's death, state-sponsored persecution wasstill on the increase. In parallel Theophilus, the Catholic archbishop ofAlexandria, had been rousing the Christian masses against Gnostics and pagans.Riots were engineered and many members of the oppressed sects fled to theshelter of the Serapeum. This was the great temple dedicated to Serapis that hadbeen built by Ptolemy I Soter (323 – 284 BC), the former general of Alexanderthe Great who established the dynasty that ruled Egypt until the time ofCleopatra (51 – 30 BC). The refugees felt sure that they would be safe there, onground for so long deemed sacred. But they were wrong. Again at the instigationof Theophilus a huge Christian mob, including large numbers of monks, besiegedand then attacked the Serapeum.77 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en470]The temple's irreplaceable library of ancient books and scrolls, arranged in thecloisters around the central building,78[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en471] was ransacked and burnt. Then withimperial troops openly supporting the Christian assault, the defenders weremassacred and the temple itself was raised to the ground .79[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en472]Reviewing the affair some time later the emperor held the victims responsiblefor their own destruction and did not punish the attackers.80[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en473] Nor was the loss of the templelibrary to be lamented. Theodosius's well-known view was that all bookscontradicting the Christian message should be burnt ‘lest they cause God angerand scandalise the pious.’81 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en474]THE FIRST INQUISITION AND THE ANCIENT ENEMYIn the early fifth century, though their numbers had drastically declined afterthe persecutions of Theophilus, church and state still kept the pressure on theremaining Gnostics in Egypt. We know, for example, that Cyril, who succeededTheophilus as archbishop of Alexandria, enforced the persecution of a group thatbelieved the material world to be the creation of the demiurge82[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en475] – a classic Gnostic view – andthat refused to accept Cyril as their illuminator (a classic Gnostic concept).83[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en476] His emissary Abbot Shenoute seizedtheir ‘books full of abomination’ and ‘of every kind of magic’ and warned:I shall make you acknowledge Archbishop Cyril, or else the sword will wipe outmost of you, and moreover those of you who are spared will go into exile.84[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en477]Cyril was a man to take seriously. In AD 415 he provoked the gruesome murder ofan extraordinary woman of Alexandria, Hypatia, a pagan philosopher said to havebeen of ‘the school of Plato and Plotinus.’85[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en478] She was famous and much loved inthe city for her ‘attainments in literature and science, as to far surpass allthe philosophers of her own time.’86[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en479] Some reports suggest that it wasout of jealousy at her obvious popularity that the archbishop had her killed.Whatever the reason she was dragged from her house on Cyril's orders by aChristian mob, carried into a church and hacked limb from limb with broken tiles(ostrakois, literally ‘oyster shells’, but the word was also used for bricktiles on the roofs of houses).87 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en480]Finally, reports one pro-Christian commentator of the time:… they carried her to a place named Cinaron, and they burned her body with fire.And all the people surrounded Archbishop Cyril and named him ‘the newTheophilus’, for he had destroyed the last remains of idolatry in the city.88[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en481]With such an atmosphere of Christian fanaticism prevalent throughout the Romanworld it is not surprising that the numerous Christian Gnostic sects of thesecond and third centuries had soon all but disappeared. In AD 447 Pope Leo theGreat still felt it necessary to condemn Gnostic writings as a ‘hotbed ofmanifold perversity’ which ‘should not only be forbidden, but entirely destroyedand burnt with fire.’89 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en482] But by theend of the fifth century it seemed that organised Gnosticism was a thing of thepast.Some of those prepared to risk their lives for their Gnostic beliefs certainlyjoined the ragged group of charismatic preachers known as the Messalians.Established at Edessa in the mid-fourth century, they were still going strong inthe sixth century. We saw in the last chapter how they might have formed part ofthe chain of transmission that would ultimately bring Gnostic texts andteachings to the Bogomils and thence to the Cathars of medieval Europe.But it was Manicheism, also a Gnostic religion with strong Christian elements,that would have provided the most obvious haven for survivors of the disbandedsects.90 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en483] Perhaps because of this,and because Manicheism was an evangelistic faith that still posed a real threatto the Church, it became the primary target of persecution during the fifthcentury. So violent and thorough was this persecution that by the end of thesixth century, though it was to survive for another thousand years in the FarEast, Manicheism was a dead force in the Roman world.91[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en484]The final measures were the work of Justinian (AD 527 – 565) who ruled theEastern Roman Empire from Constantinople. Mass burnings of Manicheans soonfollowed when he equated heresy with treason and subjected both offencesautomatically to the death penalty.92[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en485] The Manicheans had begun to actlike a secret society, disguising their identity and pretending to be goodChristians.93 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en486] Justinian's responsewas not only to burn them at the stake but to burn any of their acquaintances,Manichean or not, who had failed to denounce them.94[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en487] Significantly, in our view, healso created an official investigative agency, the Quaestiones, which wasspecifically tasked to root out and destroy the Manichean heresy.95[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en488]Seven centuries later did Pope Innocent III have Justinian's initiative in mindwhen he created a very similar instrument of terror and oppression called theInquisition?96 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en489] It was to becomegreatly feared and would ultimately take on a global role as Catholicismadvanced into the New World and Asia. It's easy to forget that when Innocentestablished it in 1233 he did so with the specific purpose of rooting out anddestroying the Cathar heresy – which we know he believed to be a resurgence ofthe more ancient heresy of Manicheism.So by unleashing the Inquisition in the 13th century, it is almost as thoughInnocent was trying to pick up where his predecessor had left off in the 6thcentury. This would have been perfectly in character because together with manyother European churchmen of the period he appears to have had a genuine sense ofcontinuity about what the Bogomils and Cathars represented and how they were tobe handled. The heretics, too, felt themselves to be part of a continuum anddealt with the Church like an old enemy who they already knew very well.What was odd was that so few of the participants on either side seemedsurprised, after such a long silence, that a fully-fledged Gnostic ‘anti-Church’was now straddling Europe like a colossus, confronting both Rome andConstantinople, and threatening to turn the tables of the world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTHE RIVALSA monstrous breed … You must eliminate such filth.Pope Innocent III (1198 – 1216), speaking of the Cathars 1[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en490] The Second Treatise of the Great Seth, one of the Nag Hammadi texts, speaks ofthe Gnostics’ experience of persecution at the hands of people who believedthemselves to be Christians. The setting could be anytime in the first fourcenturies AD before the texts were concealed. The Treatise then goes on to makea further allegation – one that the Cathars and Bogomils were to repeat athousand years later. This is that the established Church is an impostor – an‘imitation’ of the true Church that it has displaced.2[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en491]So we're now better able to understand the references in the Treatise, cited inthe previous chapter, to ‘empty people’ who ‘think that they are advancing thename of Christ’ when they persecute others. The writer is either speaking of theCatholic Church itself, or of the militant, literalist faction always in favourof persecuting its opponents, that would ultimately dominate the Church duringthe reign of Emperor Constantine – and that would impose its agenda on thefuture. Set against it, and persecuted by it, are the Gnostic adepts, ‘Sons ofLight’, founders of the true Church, described as ‘an ineffable union ofundefiled truth’.3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en492] The impostorChurch has ‘made an imitation’ of their ‘perfect assembly’ and ‘havingproclaimed a doctrine of a dead man’4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en493] (the crucified Jesus Christ), ithas tricked its followers into lifetimes of:… fear and slavery, worldly cares, and abandoned worship … For they did not knowthe Knowledge of the Greatness, that is from above, and from a fountain oftruth, and that it is not from slavery and jealousy, fear and love of worldlymatter.5 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en494]It should be obvious to the reader by now that this simple statement of Gnosticdualism, which lay at Nag Hammadi for 1600 years after being buried there in thelate fourth century, could equally well have been written by a Cathar or Bogomilperfectus of the 12th or 13th centuries. There is the same horror of worldlymatter and the same sense that it entraps and enslaves the soul. There is thesame belief that while ignorance can extend the soul's imprisonment, knowledgecan set it free. And there is the same concept of what this knowledge is – i.e.that it concerns the existence of a spiritual realm of greatness ‘above’ whichis the domain of the God of Good, the source of truth, and the long-lost home ofthe soul.The reader will recall that according to Cathar and Bogomil doctrine, Christ wasnot a physical human being ‘in the flesh’ but an immensely convincingapparition.6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en495] The Second Treatiseof the Great Seth clearly has the same thing in mind when it puts these wordsinto Christ's mouth after the Crucifixion:I did not succumb to them as they had planned … I was not afflicted at all.Those who were there punished me, and I did not die in reality but in appearance…7 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en496]Many other religious ideas that we have come to associate with the Cathars andBogomils also appear a millennium earlier in the Second Treatise of the GreatSeth – for example that the god of this world is evil and ignorant and can beidentified with the God of the Old Testament, and that his minions, the Catholicbishops are ‘mere counterfeits and laughingstocks.’8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en497] The passages we've quoted here arejust fragments of the Treatise – itself only a small part of the overallcollection of 52 Gnostic texts preserved in the Nag Hammadi library. Virtuallyany of them could serve, without alteration, as a manifesto of Cathar andBogomil beliefs. It therefore seems to us inconceivable, as many scholarscontinue to argue, that there is no link between the religion of the earlyChristian Gnostics and the later religion of the Cathars and the Bogomils.There is in our view more than a link. Despite some superficial differences –and their significant separation in time – these two religions have so much incommon at the level of their vital concepts, cosmology, doctrine and beliefsthat they're almost impossible to tell apart. When we consider that essentialelements of ritual, symbolism, initiation, structure and organisation were alsothe same, and that both the Gnostics and the medieval dualists were persecutedwith the same spirit of savage repression by the same opponent and for the samereasons, it is increasingly difficult to resist the conclusion that they must,indeed, have been one and the same thing.SEIZING CONTROL OF THE TRADITIONBecause the Catholic Church won the power-struggle against the Gnostics itgained victor's privileges over the way history would be told. It's notsurprising, therefore, while all other beliefs and doctrines are regarded asaberrations, that Catholic beliefs and doctrines tend to be treated as orthodox(literally ‘straight-teaching’) and also as ‘authentic’, ‘of true apostolicdescent’, etc, in most historical accounts.9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en498] However, a dispassionate look atwhat is now known about the broad and eclectic character of Christian beliefs inthe first three centuries does not support the Catholic claim to primacy. Thereis no doubt that the evidence shows us the nucleus of the faction that becamethe Catholic Church forming around dogmatic militants like Irenaeus andTertullian. But after the discovery of the Nag Hammadi texts, and the gradualrevelation of their contents that has followed, it has been impossible to ignorethe presence, and equal weight, of the Gnostic Churches in the same period.Since Catholics and Gnostics alike claimed that the teachings in theirpossession were the earliest and the most ‘authentic’, why has the Catholicversion for so long been accepted as gospel (literally!), and left unchallenged,while the Gnostic version was hunted down and persecuted out of existence? Isn'tit equally possible, as the Nag Hammadi texts themselves invite us to believe,that the tradition of the Gnostics was all along the ‘authentic’ one?Scholars have known for many years, for example, that the Valentinian Gnosticsof the second century AD accepted not only the four Gospels of the New Testamentthat have come down to us today (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John), ‘but manyadditional documents professing to contain traditions of the secret teachings ofJesus.’10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en499] Writing in 1967 HenryChadwick, the great historian of Christianity was happy to accept that such‘secret teachings’ did in fact once exist and suggested that they would havebeen similar to ‘the Gospel of Thomas [one of the Nag Hammadi texts] recentlyrecovered from the sands of Egypt.’11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en500] But he was not interested inquestions concerning the authenticity of these Gnostic traditions. He simplytook it for granted that whatever ‘secret teachings’ the Gnostics possessed mustself-evidently have been false. Chadwick even seemed happy to gloss over thepseudoscientific claptrap of the heresy-hater Irenaeus who, he observedapprovingly:… ingeniously vindicated the fourfold gospel on numerological principles. Four,he urged, was a sacred number corresponding to the four winds, or the four facesof the cherubim in Ezekiel …12 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en501]Chadwick accepts that even as late as the last two decades of the second centuryAD a substantial oral tradition was still in circulation, purporting to transmitthe true words of Christ. This tradition, he notes, was ‘regarded as anauthority which had not yet been wholly merged with the written gospels.’13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en502] In other words the canonical NewTestament was still incomplete by the end of the second century,14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en503] and the eventual course ofChristian doctrine was not yet set in stone.Chadwick suggests that circa AD 185 – 190, with many different ideas (bothwritten and oral) in circulation, Irenaeus, together with others from theproto-Catholic group, saw the advantage ‘which a written document possessed andwhich oral transmission did not.’15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en504] Although the Gnostic leaderMarcion had prepared his own canon some time before – much to the consternationof the Catholics – few of the other proliferating Gnostic sects of the periodaccepted it and the possibility that they would ever be able to agree amongstthemselves for sufficiently long to put a representative Gnostic canon togetherseemed remote.Amongst the proto-Catholic group there was no such hesitation. Knowing thatthose who controlled the written document would effectively have ‘the control ofauthentic tradition’,16 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en505] theylaunched their own initiative to compile and create a canonical New Testament.Since this group was dominated by men like Irenaeus who regarded their own viewsas infallible and were intolerant of the views of others, they were naturallyinclined to label whichever texts or traditions supported their views asbelonging to the authentic apostolic line and to cast into the outer darkness asinauthentic any that contradicted them.What justified this, notes Chadwick, was that ‘the teaching given by thecontemporary bishop of, say, Rome or Antioch’ was held by the Catholics to be‘in all respects identical with that of the apostles.’17[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en506] As Irenaeus himself put it in thesecond century with reference to the so-called Rule of Faith (a short summary ofthe main points of Catholic belief that he and other heresy hunters favoured):This rule is what the bishops teach now and therefore comes down from theapostles.18 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en507]Thus, irrespective of its actual origins and authenticity, any teaching given bythe Catholic bishops was automatically deemed authentic and to have come downfrom the apostles. Vice versa, any teaching of which they did not approve wasautomatically deemed inauthentic and not descended through the proper apostolicline – in other words, heretical.In an era when oral traditions were still dominant, and the bestowal ofcanonical status upon texts was in the hands of a militant faction, suchcircular arguments could only have one outcome. There is little doubt that theproto-Catholics deliberately manipulated the gradual formation of the NewTestament so that it could serve them in their early battles against theGnostics and reinforce their own claims to authenticity and exclusivity as thesole mediators of Christ's message.NO EYEWITNESSES WE CAN TRUSTCan we be sure of anything that the New Testament has to tell us?No matter how dense the smokescreen surrounding the vexed issues ofauthenticity, few would dispute that somewhere in the century between 50 BC andAD 50, mysterious and powerful events occurred in Palestine that set in motionthe Christian phenomenon. But it is not at all certain what sparked thephenomenon off. Was Christ really the Son of God, born as a flesh-and-bloodhuman being and murdered on the cross – thus somehow redeeming our sins? That'sthe Catholic position. Was he a projection or emanation from the divine – an‘appearance’ only, not really flesh-and-blood ? That's the Gnostic and Catharposition. Or could he simply have been an urban legend blown out of allproportion, or perhaps even an artificially constructed myth designed to servethe purposes of a particular religious cult?The first two possibilities, Catholic and Gnostic/Cathar, are both based onunprovable articles of faith and therefore are equally likely – or unlikely – tobe true.Though its defenders claim otherwise, there is no superior logic whatsoever inthe Catholic position. It is, after all, no more logical or inherently moreprobable to insist that Christ was the Son of God in human flesh born of avirgin than to insist that he took form only as a very convincing apparition.The third possibility – that the whole story was made up – has much to recommendit. The prime issue is the remarkable absence of solid and convincing historicalevidence to confirm that the figure known to the world as Jesus Christ everactually existed. He might have; it can't be ruled out. But it's equallypossible that there never was any such being – whether man or apparition. Hisobvious resemblance to several other much older ‘dying and resurrecting god-men’– notably Osiris in Egypt and Dionysos in Greece – has not gone unnoticed byscholars, and the possibility must be confronted that ‘Jesus Christ’ was a myth,not a man. Since no part of the canonical Gospels is thought to date earlierthan about AD 60, and some parts may be as late as AD 110, it is within thebounds of reason that everything we know about Christ's person, words and deedswas simply invented some time during the first century AD and then passed intothe oral tradition in the form of ‘eyewitness accounts’ of events that hadsupposedly taken place a couple of generations previously. Extensive editing inthe late second century AD began to standardise the oral traditions into thebeginnings of the canonical New Testament. By then, needless to say, there wasno one left alive who could claim to have witnessed, or to have known anyone whohad witnessed, or even to have known anyone who had known anyone who hadwitnessed, the events surrounding Christ's life and death.SOMEHOW THIS SECRET RELIGION WENT ONIn the early years, along with many smaller factions, we've seen that two maincompeting forms of Christianity evolved, approximately in parallel, and thatthere is no clear evidence of which came first. Both claimed primacy and soughtto reinforce their position with their own selections from the whole stock oforal and written traditions available in that period. The literalist form, whichwas to become Catholicism, gained the upper hand – and the ear of Constantine.Gnosticism, the interpretive and revelatory form of Christianity, lost out, wasdeclared a heresy and persecuted.We make no claim ourselves as to which form was the oldest or most ‘authentic.’The issue is strictly-speaking irrelevant to the hypothesis we're developinghere. Our point is simply that until literalist Catholicism began its sustainedcampaign to wipe out interpretive Gnosticism, Christianity had been diverseenough to accommodate both simultaneously. The persecutions of the Gnostics wereso successful that by the end of the sixth century it seemed that only theliteralist form had survived. However the fact that a strong Christian Gnosticreligion emerged again in the 10th century in the form of Bogomilism makes itimpossible for us to accept that the destruction of Christian Gnosticism in thesixth century was as final as it looked. Somehow this secret religion went on –either through the Manicheans, the Messalians and the Paulicians – or by anotherless obvious route.This is why the ‘Organisation’ spoken of so cryptically in the Nag Hammadiscriptures continues to intrigue us. In Chapter Five we saw that the referencesmade to it seem to hint at the existence of a secret society charged with amission to protect, restore and repromulgate Gnosticism after times of trouble.It would all sound like so much ancient wishful thinking were it not for thefact that this was more or less what happened at the end of the firstmillennium. The sudden appearance of Bogomilism in Bulgaria during the lastdecades of the 10th century was not some isolated heresy. It marked the firststep in the repromulgation and resurgence of a fully-fledged Christian-Gnosticreligion after 400 years absent from the scene. The next step was its rapidwestwards expansion as Catharism during the 12th century. By the beginning ofthe 13th century it had become a genuinely pan-European faith and the onlyserious rival that the established Church had faced for a thousand years.We know that the Church did not identify it as a new rival, but as an old anddangerous one seemingly returned from the dead. Perhaps this sense on theChurch's part, of being drawn back into an ancient conflict, one that struck atthe very heart of all its shaky claims to legitimacy and authenticity as thetrue faith, explains the terrible events that followed.CHRIST AND ANTICHRISTAll wars are terrible – no matter in what epoch they are fought, or with whatweapons. Medieval wars were particularly ghastly. But the wars of the CatholicChurch against the heresy of Catharism in the 13th century, the so-calledAlbigensian Crusades, must rank high on the list of the most repulsive, brutaland merciless conflicts that human beings have ever had the misfortune to beinvolved in.The Cathars are innocent in these matters, by any sane standards of justice. Allthey did was reject the authority of the pope and give their loyalty to anotherreligion that sought to correct what it saw as the false doctrines ofCatholicism. The rational modern mind cannot blame them for acting independentlyin this way, let alone detect any reason why their beliefs and behaviour shouldhave merited so gruesome a punishment as burning at the stake. We know that thepast is another country – where people do things differently. We understand thatthe medieval world, full of superstition and the fear of damnation (a fearfostered by the Catholic Church and used as a weapon of mind-control) was notgoverned by the same codes of interpersonal decency that we try to live bytoday. Yet the savage persecution of the Cathars, carried out in the name of theChurch, and frequently on the direct orders of its bishops, went so far beyondwhat was normal – even for that bloodstained period – that it has to raisedisturbing questions about the beliefs of the perpetrators.Because our primary focus in this book is on the long-term survival of a secretreligion, irrespective of its ‘authenticity’, we will not pursue such questionsfurther here – notably the vexed issue of whether Catholic or Cathar teachingsrepresent ‘authentic’ Christianity. Nonetheless it seems patently obvious to usthat the spirit of the gentle and loving Jesus who pervades the New Testamentdid not ride with the Catholic clergy and knights who ravaged the once free landof Occitania in the first half of the 13th century. A chronicler of the time,one of the two authors of the epic Chanson de la Croisade albigeoise (‘Song ofthe Albigensian Crusade’), summed the problem up in an ironic unofficial epitaphfor Simon de Montfort, the fearsome general who led the Catholic armies inOccitania for almost a decade of unremitting slaughter before being killed inbattle in 1218. He was buried with much pomp and ceremony at Carcassonne where,the Chanson reports:Those who can read may learn from his epitaph that he is a saint and a martyr;that he is bound to rise again to share the heritage, to flourish in that stateof unparalleled felicity, to wear a crown and have his place in the Kingdom. Butfor my part I have heard tell that the matter must stand thus: if one may seekChrist Jesus in this world by killing men and shedding blood; by the destructionof human souls; by compounding murder and hearkening to perverse council; bysetting the torch to great fires; by winning lands through violence, and workingfor the triumphs of vain pride; by fostering evil and snuffing out good; byslaughtering women and slitting children's throats – why, then, he must needswear a crown, and shine resplendent in Heaven.19[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en508]In other words, unless the lessons of humility, nonviolence, forgiveness andunconditional love so plain to read in the New Testament have somehow beenturned upside down, inside out and back to front, there is no way that anyoneseeking Christ in this world is going to find him by following Simon deMontfort's route. And if that is the case, since we're in a position today tostand back from the propaganda and prejudices of the time, doesn't it suggestthat the entire Catholic onslaught against the Cathars was fundamentallyunchristian?Or even, as the Cathars themselves suggested, ‘anti-Christian’?‘MORE EVIL THAN SARACENS …’We've already filled in the background to the Albigensian Crusades in earlierchapters. The tremendous success of the Cathar heresy in Occitania and otherparts of Europe during the 12th century had for many years been watched withenvy and growing alarm by the Catholic hierarchy in Rome. By the early 13thcentury it is estimated that more than half the Occitanian population hadabandoned the Church and that growing numbers were looking exclusively toCatharism to meet their spiritual needs. Worse still, as we saw in Chapter Two,the local nobility gave tacit and sometimes even overt support to the Cathars,frequently had relatives amongst them, sided with them in disputes with thebishops, and were closely linked to some of the leading perfecti. Once it hadbecome clear that the Cathar religion was not a flash in the pan, but quitepossibly formed part of a great coordinated plot against the Church, it wasobvious that sooner or later one pope or another was going to have to dosomething about it. The only question was what exactly, and when?That the ‘what’ should be the terror weapon of a crusade had probably beendecided by Pope Innocent III some years before the perfect excuse to use such aweapon of terror presented itself.20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en509] But when that happened he actedimmediately.The precipitating incident was the assassination of the papal legate toOccitania, one Peter de Castelnau, in January 1208. A former monk of theCistercian Abbey of Fontfroide, de Castelnau was in Occitania on Innocent'sorders accompanied by another leading Cistercian, Arnaud Amalric, the abbot ofCîteaux.21 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en510] In 1207 they stirred updeep-seated resentments when they tried to form a league of southern barons tohunt down the Cathars. Raymond VI, the powerful Count of Toulouse refused tojoin and was excommunicated by de Castelnau. The excommunication was withdrawnin January 1208 after Raymond had been forced to apologise personally to thepapal legate – a shameful climb-down for such a highly-placed nobleman. The verynext morning one of Raymond's knights, perhaps seeking to avenge the humiliationof his master, rode up to de Castelnau as he prepared to ford the River Rhoneand ran him through with a spear. He died on the spot.22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en511]Two months later, on 10 March 1208, Innocent declared the Crusade – the firsttime ever that the term ‘crusade’ was used for a war against fellow Christians.Like the Christian emperors of Rome long before, he clearly gave the highestpriority to the extirpation of heresy – higher even than to the wars to regainthe Holy Land. He wrote:Attack the followers of heresy more fearlessly even than the Saracens – sincethey are more evil – with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. Forward thensoldiers of Christ! Forward brave recruits to the Christian army! Let pious zealinspire you to avenge this monstrous crime against your God.23[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en512]Meanwhile Arnaud Amalric, abbot of Cîteaux, had been sent to northern France torally support amongst the nobles there. ‘May the man who abstains from thisCrusade,’ he is quoted as saying, ‘never drink wine again; may he never eat,morning or evening, off a good linen cloth, or dress in fine stuff again to theend of his days; and at his death may he be buried like a dog.’24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en513]But such browbeating was hardly needed to mobilise the rednecks at the court ofthe king of France. They were raring to go anyway. Here was an opportunity toacquire wealth and status with an adventure relatively near to home and to earnpapal indulgences and forgiveness of sins that would normally have required muchharder work in the Holy Land. Along with dozens of B-list aristocrats like Simonde Montfort who were looking to get rich quick, thousands of volunteers at thefoot-soldier level also poured in from all walks of life. The lowliest man couldbenefit since crusading meant the automatic postponement of all his debts andthe release of his property from the hold of creditors for the duration of hisservice. 25 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en514]Still the preparations took more than a year. By February 1209 militarydetachments for the Crusade were reported to be massing all over northernFrance.26 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en515] But it was not until St.John's Day, 24 June 1209, that the full force, estimated to number 20,000 men,had assembled at the French city of Lyons ready for the march south. Simon deMontfort was with it but not yet its general. For this first campaign theterrifying Christian horde was headed by Arnaud Amalric himself.27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en516] It need not be imagined that beinga Cistercian abbot, supposedly dedicated to a lifetime of Christian peace andcharity, would inhibit him in any way on the battlefield. Far from it. AtBéziers, the first Cathar city that he attacked, Arnaud Amalric was about toorder an infamous atrocity …HELL'S ARMYConditioned by television images of modern warfare with smart bombs and otherhigh-tech weaponry it is difficult to imagine the atmosphere of primal harm andmenace that must have radiated like heat off the big medieval army that marchedout of Lyons on 24 June 1209.Its iron fist, mounted, armoured from head to foot and heavily-armed, was anelite fighting force of trained killers. These were the knights – the samuraiclass of old Europe. Gathered from the aristocracy, they were men who had beengroomed for warfare since childhood. They probably totalled no more than 1,000individuals, but each of them, depending on his resources, was supported inbattle by anything from four to thirty hand-picked cavalry and infantry whofought at his side as a skilled and disciplined unit.28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en517]Lower down the social ladder the theme of discipline in the crusading army wascontinued amongst divisions of professional soldiers specialised in particularmilitary arts. They included the gunners who operated the great war-catapultsand stone-guns – the trebuchets and mangonels that had a range of almost half akilometer and could hurl projectiles weighing 40 kilograms. There were teams ofbattering-ram specialists who would breach the city-gates, while other teamsassembled and operated huge siege towers from which archers could fire down onthe defendants inside the walls. Sappers and siege engineers were also neededfor the business of filling in moats and undermining foundations .29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en518]Less disciplined but equally deadly, and in a way far more frightening, were themercenaries, known as routiers, who had been hired for their unprincipledferocity. These were times of widespread poverty and frequent famines in Europe,and droves of the landless, the unemployed and the dispossessed wandered thecountryside. The most efficient and ruthless amongst them formed up into lawlessbands, looting and killing to support themselves, and were hired en masse by theChristian army that the pope had unleashed on Occitania.30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en519] ‘They were,’ notes Zoé Oldenbourg:… desperate fellows with nothing to lose, and therefore would plunge on throughthick and thin regardless … They formed a series of shock battalions, all theeasier to utilise since no one had the slightest qualms about sacrificing them.The most important thing … was the terror they inspired in the civilianpopulation … Not content with mere pillage and rape they indulged in massacreand torture for the sheer fun of the thing, roasting children over slow firesand chopping men into small pieces.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en520]Even lower down the pecking-order than the feared routiers were the ribauds, theunpaid camp followers, numbering several thousands in their own right, who hadattached themselves unofficially to the Crusade. They too were desperate people– a ragged bunch of bare-arsed muggers, rapists and corpse looters. But weirdlythey elected their own ‘king’ on the campaign who divided the chores and thespoils of war amongst the rest.32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en521]Last but not least there were the holy rollers – wild, itinerant Christianpreachers and groups of their fanatical followers armed with crude weapons likescythes and clubs who hoped to gain a special dispensation in heaven bymurdering any Cathars that the main army missed.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en522]It seems richly ironic that the self-proclaimed Catholic Church of so peacefuland loving a figure as Jesus Christ was not only prepared to raise an army tomassacre those who disagreed with it, but also to pack its ranks with the mostnotorious murderers and brigands of the age. But if we look at the whole affairfrom the Cathar perspective the sense of disconnect goes away. It is not, as itslater apologists would claim, that the church of a good and loving God wassomehow (aberrantly, temporarily) provoked into extreme violence by extremecircumstances. In the Cathar take on this, the Catholic Church served the God ofEvil; accordingly it was behaving entirely in character when it recruited anarmy of demons.Now formed up behind Arnaud Amalric into a vast column of men and supplies morethan 4 miles in length, this demonic force – or army of valiant crusadersdepending on one's point of view – bristled with axes and pikes and seethed withthe intent to do violence.‘KILL THEM ALL’: THE FEAST OF SAINT MARY MAGDALENE AND THE WORKINGS OF DIVINEVENGEANCE …After taking a meandering course through Occitania, pausing only to accept thesurrender of settlements unable to defend themselves and to burn small groups ofCathars along the way, Arnaud Amalric and his 20,000 hooligans fetched up infront of the prosperous city of Béziers on 21 July 1209. Its walls were verythick, very high and very well defended and everyone assumed that this was goingto be a long siege.Some curiosities now coincide.It is our hypothesis that the Cathars were the descendants, through anunderground stream of secret religion, of the Christian Gnostics of the firstfew centuries. Scholars agree that the Christian Gnostics of that period had aspecial reverence for Mary Magdalene, who plays a small but highly significantrole in the New Testament. By comparison her status in the Nag Hammadi texts iselevated to that of Christ's first apostle, his closest confidante, and perhapseven his lover.34 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en523] We weretherefore naturally interested to learn that the area around Béziers had beenknown for centuries before the Crusade for its special and fervent dedication toMary Magdalene.35 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en524] A localtradition had it that she had fled here by ship from Palestine in the mid-firstcentury, landed at Marseilles, and become the first Christian missionary in whatwas then the Roman Empire's Provincia Gallia Narbonensis.36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en525] Odder still, 21 July, the datethat the pope's army pitched camp before Béziers, was the eve of the annualFeast of Mary Magdalene, held on 22 July.37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en526] Oddest of all, however, was whatwould happen on the feast day itself.Béziers was by no means entirely a Cathar city. There may have been as many asseveral thousand Cathar credentes living there, but Catholics are likely to havebeen in the majority. We know that there were 222 Cathar perfecti present on theday the siege began because a list of their names, prepared by Renaud deMontpeyroux, the Catholic bishop of Béziers, has survived.38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en527] The bishop (whose predecessor hadbeen assassinated in 1205) scuttled through the gates with the list soon afterthe crusaders began to arrive and returned from their camp a few hours laterwith an offer. If the townsfolk would hand over the 222 named Cathar notablesfor immediate burning then the city and everyone else living in it would bespared.39 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en528]It was in fact a pretty good offer but, to their lasting moral credit, theCatholic burghers of Béziers rejected it, stating that they ‘would rather bedrowned in the salt sea's brine’ than betray their fellow citizens .40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en529]What was to follow was a good deal worse than drowning.It started on the early morning of the 22 July with a minor and whollyunnecessary skirmish. Separated by some distance from the main force of thecrusader army, the ribauds – camp followers – had gathered by the banks of theRiver Orb which flowed a little to the south of the city walls. A bridge leadingto one of the city gates spanned the Orb at this point and now one of theribauds strolled onto it, shouting insults and challenges to the defenders.Angered by his temerity some inside rushed spontaneously out through the gateand down onto the bridge where they caught and killed him and threw his bodyinto the water. Probably they expected to retreat to the safety of the city atonce but before they could do so a gang of camp followers swarmed onto thebridge and locked them in combat. At the same moment, with what was obviously anexperienced eye for the main chance, the elected ‘king’ of the ribauds ‘calledall his lads together and shouted ‘Come on, let's attack’.41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en530]Within minutes, driven on by an ugly cocktail of crowd-psychology, bloodlust andgreed, a howling mob bore down on the scrum at the bridge. According to thechronicler of the Chanson de la Croisade albigeoise:There were more than 15,000 of them, all barefooted, dressed only in shirts andbreeches, and unarmed save for a variety of hand weapons.42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en531]Hatchets? Butchers’ knives? Cudgels? The mind boggles at the thought of whatprimitive bludgeons and rusty blades these dregs of the Crusade wielded as theyforced the bridge and pursued the foolish skirmishers back up the slope towardsthe city walls. No one is quite sure exactly what happened next but by now thewhole crusader camp was roused and bands of mercenaries and regular soldierswere charging into the fray. Most probably the ribauds succeeded in seizingcontrol of the gate as the skirmishers tried to slip back inside, and were ableto hold it open whilst crusader reinforcements poured through. But whatever themechanism, the result was the same. With their defences hopelessly breached theproud citizens of Béziers were now doomed beyond any redemption:No cross or altar or crucifix could save them. And these raving beggarly lads,they killed the clergy too, and the women and the children. I doubt one personcame out alive.43 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en532]The leaders of the Crusade made no attempt to stop or even limit the massacres.Quite the contrary, as the knights rushed to arm and mount, eager not to missthe action, a group of them reportedly asked Arnaud Amalric how they were todistinguish the many Catholics in the town from the heretics they had come tokill. The abbot is notorious for replying in Latin: ‘Caedite eos. Novit enimDominus qui sunt eius.’Which means:‘Kill them all; God will look after his own.’44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en533]Though most of the killing was done by the lower orders, a particularly awfulbloodbath was unleashed inside the Church of Mary Magdalene by the knightsthemselves. Here a multitude of Cathars and Catholics – old and young, men,women and children – were cowering in fear. Their numbers were estimated bychroniclers at the time as between 1,000 and 7,000. Just like the Gnostic andpagan refugees who had taken shelter inside the Serapeum in Alexandria ninecenturies previously when it was attacked by Christian forces, they probablyhoped that the hallowed ground would save them. And just as in Alexandria, itdidn't. The knights burst in and slaughtered them all.45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en534]By noon, a few hours after the fighting had started at the bridge, the entirepopulation of the city had been murdered. Working with all the contemporaryestimates, and allowing for exaggeration in some cases, modern scholarsgenerally concur on a figure of between 15,000 and 20,000 for the total numberof the dead of Béziers.46 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en535]Guiraraut Riquier of Narbonne, one of the last of the Occitanian troubadours,expressed the scale of the tragedy in a song:Béziers has fallen. They're dead. Clerks, women, children. No quarter. Theykilled Christians too. I rode out. I couldn't see or hear, a living creature … They killed seventhousand people, Seven thousand souls who sought sanctuary in Saint Madeleine. The steps of the altar, were wet with blood. The church echoed with the cries.Afterwards they slaughtered the monks who tolled the bells.They used the silver cross, as a chopping block to behead them.47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en536]Clearly Riquier's sympathies were not with the crusaders and he had no interestin making them look good. We might think that the whole scene was just somethinghe'd invented as anti-Catholic propaganda were it not that all other accounts ofthe sack of the city, supported by archaeological evidence, also speak of afearful massacre taking place inside the Church of Mary Magdalene.48[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en537] Indeed the Catholic forces feltthey had nothing to hide or be ashamed of in the killing of so many heretics inso holy a place.The Cistercian chronicler Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay proclaimed:It was right that these shameless dogs should be captured and destroyed on thefeast day of the woman [i.e. Mary Magdalene] they had insulted and whose churchthey had defiled …49 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en538]Arnaud Amalric, abbot of Cîteaux and leader of the Crusade, was thrilled too –and not just with the slaughter in the church but with the overall tally of theday. In a breathless letter to his master Pope Innocent III, the man at thesource of all this carnage, he wrote proudly:Nearly 20,000 of the citizens were put to the sword, regardless of age or sex.The workings of divine vengeance have been wondrous.50[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en539]TRUTH IN EXTREMESOur purpose thus far has been to track the secret tradition that lay behindCatharism, that kept a complex system of Gnostic spirituality alive in the Westthrough a thousand years of persecution, and that the Albigensian Crusades weredesigned to obliterate forever. We will not offer a detailed history of theCrusades themselves since several excellent books already exist that provide athorough record of the main sieges and battles. Nevertheless, the best chance tostudy human behaviour always comes in the starkest, most dangerous and mostextreme circumstances. For this reason, as we will see in the next chapter, theCrusades provide a unique opportunity to get closer to the truth about the twosides.The truth is that upon the citizens of Béziers, who had threatened no one,aggressed no one, gone out to make war on no one, and merely followed their ownharmless beliefs, the Catholic side unleashed an army from hell to inflict ahellish atrocity of rare and terrible evil. Zoé Oldenbourg suggests that weshould reflect on what this tells us:Massacres such as that at Béziers are extremely rare; we are forced to acceptthe proposition that even human cruelty has its limits. Even amongst the worstatrocities which history has to show us through the centuries, massacres of thissort stand out as exceptions; and yet it is the head of one of the leadingmonastic orders in Catholic Christendom who has the honour of being responsible(while conducting a ‘Holy War’ to boot) for one such monstrous exception to therules of war. We should be on our guard against underrating the significance ofthis fact.51 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en540]Nor did the atrocities stop with Béziers. They went on and on, seeminglyendlessly, each with some mad demonic quality of its own. But soon afterBéziers, having bathed in sufficient blood to satisfy his appetite, ArnaudAmalric opted for a less ‘front-line’ role. His successor, chosen to prosecutethe Crusade with the utmost vigour, was Simon de Montfort, described as a manwho ‘prayed, took Communion and killed as easily as drawing breath.’52[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en541]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTHE SWORD AND THE FIREIt was not until the formation of the Holy Office [of the Inquisition] that theworld was presented with the spectacle of an organisation prepared to kill,starve, and dispossess those who had deviated a hair's breadth from its owntheological preoccupations. No other major religion has ever produced such anorganisation. There are secular organisations which have acted with equalferocity and efficiency, but, unlike the Inquisition, they did not last forseven centuries.Arthur Guirdham, The Great Heresy The crusading army rested three days in the meadows around the reeking corpse ofBéziers, then marched off to besiege the great city of Carcassonne – whichsurrendered two weeks later without putting up a fight. A condition of thesurrender was that this time the inhabitants would not be slaughtered; insteadall their property was confiscated and they were expelled from Carcassonne,penniless and homeless, never to return.In August 1209 Simon de Montfort officially took command of the army, and of anew title, Viscount of Béziers and Carcassonne.1[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en542] But by mid-September the vastmajority of the forces at his disposal had packed their bags and gone home. Thiswas a routine and predictable desertion since the indulgences and remission ofsins that the pope bestowed on crusaders required them to put in a minimum of 40days on campaign. The surrender of Carcassonne was accomplished just within the40 days but after that, in the minds of most of the volunteers, the campaign wasover.With a small band of dedicated knights de Montfort hung on in what was now theheart of very hostile territory over the winter. Then in 1210 – and yearlythereafter – the pope preached another crusade and the ranks of the army swelledonce more.2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en543]A macabre highlight of the 1210 campaign was the capture of the fortress of Bramafter three days of stiff resistance. Because they had put up a fight thesurviving members of the garrison, numbering over 100, suffered a terriblepunishment. On de Montfort's orders their eyes were put out. Then their nosesand upper lips were crudely hacked off. One man was left one eye, not out ofcharity but so that he could lead the stumbling, blinded, mutilated soldiers toCaberet, the crusaders’ next target, as a very particular message for thedefenders there.3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en544]At Béziers, because the city's entire population, heretic and Catholic alike,had been indiscriminately massacred, there could be no mass burning of heretics.Although de Montfort had personally supervised the immolation of a small groupof Cathar perfecti at Castres in 1209,4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en545] it was therefore not until the1210 campaign that the opportunity came his way to burn a large number ofheretics at once – a sight, according to the pro-Catholic chronicler Pierre desVaux-de-Cernay, that all the crusaders experienced with feelings of ‘intensejoy’.5 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en546]The opportunity was provided by the fortress city of Minerve where it was knownthat many Cathar perfecti – both men and women – had taken refuge. De Montfortlaid siege to the stronghold in June 1210 and forced its surrender some weekslater after cutting off its water supply and deploying his war-catapults andstone-guns to bombard it mercilessly. As had been the case at the surrender ofCarcassonne there was no massacre; but this time the Cathar perfecti shelteringin Minerve were identified and singled out. Their choice was either to recant ordie. Initially none recanted, and one of the perfecti explained to a Catholicpriest: ‘Neither death nor life can tear us from the faith to which we arejoined.’6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en547] On 22 July 1210, theexact anniversary of the sack of Béziers (and again, significantly, the feastday of Saint Mary Magdalene )7 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en548]Vaux-de-Cernay reports that a huge fire was prepared. While it blazed and roaredthe prisoners were brought out before it and:… more than one hundred and forty of these heretical perfecti were flung thereonat one time. To tell the truth, there was no need for our men to drag themthither; for they remained obdurate in their wickedness, and with great gaietyof heart cast themselves into the fire. Three women, however, were spared; beingbrought down from the stake … and reconciled with the Holy Roman Church.8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en549]What stands out from the next year's campaign – 1211 – is the fate of an evenlarger group of perfecti. On 3 May 1211, after a lengthy siege, the crusadersbreached the walls of Lavaur and poured through, seizing the city. Amongst thecaptives were more than 400 perfecti, both men and women, who were burnt on agigantic bonfire.9 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en550] Though notCathars, the 80 knights who had commanded the garrison were hanged forprotecting them. Guiraude, the Lady of Lavaur, was also brutalised thenmurdered. This high-ranking Occitan noblewoman was a Cathar credente, much lovedin the city, of whom it was said: ‘Never did a living soul leave her roofwithout having eaten well first.’10[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en551] De Montfort handed her over to aband of mercenaries who dragged her through the streets heaping indignities uponher, before throwing her down a well and killing her with stones.11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en552]A month later de Montfort burnt 60 more Cathar perfecti at Cassis.12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en553]In 1213 King Peter II of Aragon, famous for having recently won a great victoryagainst the Moors in Spain, intervened against the crusaders. Some of thehard-pressed Occitan noblemen who were protecting the Cathars were hisrelatives, and there was a large population of Cathars in Aragon itself. Peterbrought hope, a splendid force of 2,000 battle-hardened knights and 50,000infantry into the equation – more than enough to change the course of the war.But it was not to be. Though he was heavily outnumbered, de Montfort attackedPeter at Muret and, through brilliant, ruthless generalship, succeeded inkilling him in battle.13 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en554] At thesight of this terrible and totally unexpected catastrophe the Aragonese andOccitan forces hesitated, then began to retreat. The retreat turned to panic andthen to a rout with De Montfort's knights in hot pursuit. Thousands were cutdown, drowned in a nearby river, or crushed as they fled. 14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en555]It took the Occitan nobles three years to lick their wounds and gather theirstrength before they were ready to take on de Montfort again. Nonetheless by1216 the Count of Toulouse had succeeded in raising an army and, for the firsttime, began to inflict serious reverses on the crusaders. Using his favouredstrategy – if in doubt attack – de Montfort tried to take the initiative bybesieging Toulouse. The city fought back ferociously and – refusing to be put onthe psychological defensive – routinely sent out armed sorties to attack deMontfort in his own camp.The siege dragged on for many months and the defenders’ sorties grew ever moredaring. On the morning of 25 June 1218, while repelling one of these raids, deMontfort was killed outright by a projectile from a stone-gun mounted on thewalls of Toulouse and said to have been fired by a crew of women and young girls.15 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en556] The Chanson de la Croisadealbigeoise describes his death:A stone flew straight to its proper mark, and smote Count Simon upon his helm ofsteel, in such wise that his eyeballs, brains, teeth, skull and jawbone all flewinto pieces, and he fell down upon the ground stark dead, blackened andbloody.16 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en557]THE DARKEST HOUR BEFORE THE FALSEST DAWNWith de Montfort thus felled like a pole-axed ox his son Amaury took charge andabandoned the failed siege within a month. In 1219, however, he was back inaction leading yet another crusade. This time he was joined by Prince Louis ofFrance, out to do his crusading duty and bringing with him ‘20 bishops, 30counts, 600 knights and 10,000 archers .’17[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en558] The two armies met in front of theunfortunate city of Marmande, which Amaury had already besieged, and launched ajoint attack, overwhelming its defences.Then another of those demonic interludes of the Crusades took place – when theCatholic troops, urged on by their bishops, fell upon the fleeing citizens inthe narrow streets of the city. From the Chanson comes this harrowingdescription of what they did at Marmande:They hurried into the town, waving sharp swords, and it was now that themassacre and fearful butchery began. Men and women, barons, ladies, babes inarms, were all stripped and despoiled and put to the sword.The ground was littered with blood, brains, fragments of flesh, limbless trunks,hacked-off arms and legs, bodies ripped up or stove in, livers and hearts thathad been chopped to pieces or ground into mash. It was as though they had raineddown from the sky. The whole place ran with blood – streets, fields, river bank.Neither man, nor woman, young or old survived; not a single person escaped …18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en559]Did the Catholic forces serve the God of Evil, as the Cathars claimed?We cannot say whether a ‘God’ of any sort was behind the butchery at Béziers andMarmande, the mass burnings and martyrdom of the perfecti and the ruin ofOccitania. But since the Albigensian Crusades were launched and maintainedexclusively on the pope's initiative, we can say, without equivocation, that theCatholic Church was directly responsible for all these evil things, and that itwas acting in the name of its God.Soon after Marmande, their 40 days of crusading up, their sins forgiven andtheir indulgences earned, Prince Louis and his French soldiers went home. Amauryde Montfort and his much diminished army were left to continue the campaign butit soon became obvious that they were not capable of winning it alone. Part ofthe problem was generalship: although a competent soldier, Amaury was a man ofgreatly inferior calibre to his warrior father. But equally important was arenewed spirit of national resistance in Occitania, where the people and noblesnow began a determined fightback against the occupying forces. Under theleadership of the Count of Toulouse, huge territories were recaptured and by thetime of his death in August 1222 the war of liberation seemed unstoppable. Theadvances continued under his son and in January 1224 the young Count of Toulouseand the Count of Foix – the other main leader of the Occitanian resistance –signed a peace treaty with Amaury de Montfort that secured the withdrawal of thebulk of crusading forces.19 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en560]But doom still overshadowed Occitania and its citizens of all religiouspersuasions who had protected the Cathars so bravely, and died souncomplainingly on their behalf, through the 15 years of horror from 1209 to1224. It is a quite remarkable fact of these dreadful wars that the Catharsnever once seem to have been blamed by their non-Cathar countrymen for thecatastrophe that all were now plunged in together. And it is remarkable too,although Cathar credentes did join the resistance, that there is not a singleexample in all the extensive records of the Albigensian Crusades of Catharperfecti ever participating in any way in violence. Despite enormous provocation– literally to the death – they seem to have adhered with almost superhumanconsistency to their principles of absolute pacifism and non-resistance .20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en561]Nor is it that they were simply suicidal and wanted to die – something that theyhave frequently and quite wrongly been accused of. Despite their negative viewof material life the Cathars were utterly opposed to suicide and believed thateach of us, so far as possible, should live out the natural term of our soul'simprisonment. Accordingly the perfecti disguised themselves, abandoned thewearing of their characteristic black robes, went on the run, sheltered wherethey could in safe-houses, caves, or forests, and used any and every form ofevasion short of actually fighting back. As Zoé Oldenbourg observes:It is easy to see how, to that hard-pressed society, such hunted, indomitablepacifists must have appeared as the only true fathers in religion and sources ofspiritual consolation, the one genuine moral authority which men could obey.21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en562]THE POPE HIRES THE FRENCH TO FINISH THE JOBThe treaty of January 1224 was the falsest of dawns. Only a month after he hadsigned it Amaury de Montfort divested himself of his inherited title to the vastswathe of Occitania that his father had won during his glory years. All theselands that the de Montforts had stolen from their rightful Occitanian ownerswere now officially handed over by Amaury to a man much better equipped toconsolidate the spectacular land-grab forever – the king of France .22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en563]Previously, under King Philip Augustus, the French monarchy had resisted directinvolvement in the Albigensian Crusades – despite many strident demands from thepapacy for French intervention. Although Philip had not objected to theparticipation of his son Louis, as well as some of his barons and lesser nobles,he had made a clear policy decision to stay out of it himself. But when the oldking died on 14 July 1223, it was Louis who succeeded to the throne23[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en564] – the same Prince Louis who hadordered the despicable massacre at Marmande in 1219.Now crowned Louis VIII, and with legal title to much of Occitania handed to himon a plate by Amaury de Montfort, he was ready for a return visit. This timewhat he had in mind was full-scale annexation under the disguise of a crusade.Even so he drove a hard bargain with Pope Honorius III (Innocent III’ssuccessor) who, conveniently, had begun to urge him to mount a new crusade intoOccitania from the moment he had ascended to the throne. So desperate wasHonorius to smash the Cathars once and for all that he made an unprecedentedagreement with Louis. In return for subduing Occitania, the crown would berewarded to the measure of one tenth of all French Church revenues for fiveyears .24 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en565]In the spring of 1226, almost two years after he had received the titledeeds toOccitania from Amaury de Montfort, Louis VIII set out on his bogus ‘crusade’ ofannexation. So overwhelming was the force he led that he received the surrenderof several great cities, including Carcassonne and Narbonne, without even havingto fight. His first and last major setback occurred on 8 November 1226 when hewas suddenly taken ill and died .25[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en566]But still the campaign went on. Louis had been married to Blanche of Castile, ahard-hearted and determined women with vast ambitions for their 12-year-old son(also Louis – the future ‘Saint King’ Louis IX) to whom she was now regent. Onher orders the French army remained in Occitania, gradually wearing down theresistance – once again represented mainly by the Counts of Toulouse and Foix.In 1228 and 1229 the French adopted a scorched earth policy, unleashing a terrorcampaign on the countryside, burning farms and villages throughout Occitania,destroying crops, driving the inhabitants out as refugees. By 1229 the will ofthe people to resist further after years of exhausting conflict had been utterlydestroyed and the counts sued for peace .26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en567]It was a crushing peace that included a public scourging in Notre Dame Cathedralin Paris of the Count of Toulouse on 12 April 1229 .27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en568] And although it marked theofficial end of the Albigensian Crusades, it robbed Occitania of itsindependence forever, putting a huge area of this once free land under Frenchcontrol – effectively as an occupied state – and leading to its full annexationinto the kingdom of France within half a century.One of the provisions of the treaty allowed the count to retain nominal title tosome of his hereditary domains around Toulouse but also obliged him to go intoexile for five years, this exile to start no later than June 1230. In order toreduce even further his time amongst his own subjects, and thus his potential asa focus of rebellion, he was detained in Paris as a house prisoner in the LouvrePalace for six months after signing the treaty. By the time he reached Toulousein November 1229 he found that the city's massive defensive walls had beenpulled down to ensure that it would never again become a centre of pro-Catharand anti-French resistance.28 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en569]PIECES OF SILVERDespite the mass holocausts of perfecti, and increasingly focussed persecution,Catharism continued throughout the 1220s to be a vibrant religion that had animportant place in the life of Occitania and that still attracted large numbersof credentes. There is evidence from the first half of the decade, when itseemed that the curse of the Crusades had been lifted, of fairly activereorganisation and restructuring of the Cathar Church. The jurisdictionalboundaries of bishoprics were re-established and in 1225 the Cathars even feltconfident enough to establish a new bishopric – that of Razes.29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en570] Although many perfecti had beenlost to the stake it has been calculated that several hundred, both male andfemale, were still active in Occitania in 1225.30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en571] So clearly, while the AlbigensianCrusades had done much damage and taken many lives, they had not yet succeededin their primary goal of eradicating the heresy of Catharism.Military activities had of course occupied centre stage during the Crusades, butan element of heresy hunting had followed every campaign since 1209. In July1214, for example, at the height of Simon de Montfort's successes, we findFoulques, the hated Catholic bishop of Toulouse, appointing a certain:Brother Dominic and his companions … to extirpate heresy and eliminate vice, andpromote the teachings of the Faith … as preachers in our diocese.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en572]This ‘Brother Dominic’ was Father Dominic de Guzmán, the Spanish monk who was toestablish the famous Dominican monastic order in the Toulouse area on 11February 1218.32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en573] Early on in theAlbigensian Crusades, when Arnaud Amalric was still papal legate, Dominic hadbeen invested with inquisitorial powers. Until his death in 1221 he deployedthese powers mercilessly and his systematic programme of persecutions andinvestigations in Occitania laid the groundwork that would lead to the formalestablishment of the much-feared papal Inquisition in 1233.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en574]The reverses suffered by the crusaders after Simon de Montfort's death in 1218had been a set-back to the heresy hunters too. But all this changed when theFrench renewed the Crusades in 1226 and, under the devout guidance of Blanche ofCastile, made it clear that they supported the strongest action againstheretics. Soon afterwards Peter Isarn, the Cathar bishop of Carcassonne, andGérard de la Mothe, a Cathar deacon from La Bessède, were burned at the stake.34[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en575]The peace treaty that Count Raymond VI of Toulouse went to France to sign, andendured a public scourging for on 12 April 1229, introduced draconian proceduresfor the hunting down of heresy.35 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en576]In the following years the gradual expansion of the use of these procedures,always backed up by ‘the secular arm’ – i.e. the French occupation forces –meant that the Church came to exercise unlimited power over the life and libertyof the people of Occitania. As a signatory to the treaty Count Raymond was evenobliged to persecute heretics himself – the same heretics who he and his fatherhad fought so hard to protect for the past 20 years. He was to order his ownbailiffs to hunt them down on the much reduced lands that the treaty had leftnominally under his control, and he was to assist in hunting them down on thefar larger lands that had been ceded to the French crown:We will purge these lands of heretics and of the stench of heresy and we willalso aid the purgation of the lands which the Lord King shall hold … In orderbetter and more easily to unmask them [the heretics], we promise to pay twomarks of silver for the next two years and, after that, one mark to every personwho causes a heretic to be arrested, on condition that the heretic is condemnedas such by the bishop of the place, or by a competent authority.36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en577]As well as paying blood money to informers, Raymond was also required to paylarge sums directly to the Church – 10,000 marks, supposedly to repair damagedone to its property by heretics, 4,000 marks to the monasteries, and a further4,000 marks to support 14 masters of Catholic theology at the University ofToulouse.37 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en578] The idea, commentsmedieval historian Martin Barber, was to fill the land ‘with bastions oforthodoxy where heretics could find no comfort or protection.’38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en579]INFORMER CULTUREAt the same time the heat was turned up on individual Cathars at all levels witha whole raft of new statutes. These 45 cold-hearted, methodical, pettifogging,bureaucratic decrees made the suppression of heresy obligatory under common law.A few examples will give us a glimpse of just how far the Church was prepared togo in invading and taking control of people's everyday lives and drawing theminto inhumanities:• In every parish throughout the land the Catholic bishops were to nominate apriest and two or three trusted laypersons ‘of unblemished reputation, who shalltake an oath to search out, loyally and assiduously, such heretics as may beresident in the said parish.’ The job of these state-sponsored vigilantesrequired them to ‘make a close inspection of all suspect houses, their chambersand cellarage, and likewise all concealed hiding places, the which to bedemolished.’ They were to arrest not only heretics but also anyone who hadhelped heretics in any way.• A person who had permitted a heretic to stay on his land was to confess tothis crime forthwith: ‘else on conviction he will forfeit his lands inperpetuity, and be liable to personal punishment.’• Persons whose lands were used by heretics without their knowledge or agreementwere subject to the same penalties.• ‘The house in which a heretic is discovered shall be razed to the ground, andthe land on which it stands confiscated.’• ‘If the resident bailiff of a locality suspected to be a haunt of hereticsdoes not hunt the said heretics down zealously, he shall lose his positionwithout compensation.’• ‘All persons may search out heretics on their neighbours’ land.’• Heretics who had abjured Catharism and returned to the Church were to wear‘two crosses on their outer garment, one on the right and other on the leftside, and of a different colour from the garment itself …’• In every parish all males over 14 years of age and all females over 12 wererequired to swear an oath before their bishop, renewable every two yearsthereafter, that they would be loyal Catholics, abjure heresy, help to hunt downheretics, and inform on any heretics known to them. In the process the name ofevery person dwelling in every parish was to be recorded and those who failed totake the oath were to be treated as suspected heretics.• Every person of either sex on the parish lists (again aged over 14 in the caseof males and over 12 in the case of females) was to be compelled to confess totheir parish priest at least three times a year and to take Communion atChristmas, Easter and Pentecost. ‘Priests are to seek out any who fail to attendHoly Communion, and who thereby incur suspicion of heretical beliefs.’• Lay persons were forbidden to possess any of the books of the Old and NewTestament ‘with the exception of the Psalter, the Breviary, and the Book ofHours of the Blessed Virgin; and it is rigorously forbidden to possess eventhese in the vernacular tongue.’• ‘Any person denounced by public opinion, and whose ill reputation is known tothe bishop, shall properly be called a heretic.’39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en580]And so the statutes droned on, releasing into the free air of Occitania thehorrible odour of a Nazi-style informer culture and, as Zoé Oldenbourg observes,setting up ‘a system of virtual police control over the entire population.’40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en581] We use the word Nazi advisedlyhere. A decade and a half earlier, in 1215 at its Fourth Lateran Council, theCatholic Church had already anticipated the Warsaw Ghetto by more than 700 yearswhen it compelled the Jews of Europe to stitch a prominent yellow circle ontotheir clothing.41 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en582] Now, followingthe 1229 treaty, we see the same treatment – albeit with the different symbol ofthe two crosses – applied to reconciled heretics. Considered a ‘symbol of shame’the two crosses came routinely to be coloured yellow as specified in a laterstatute which also gave the exact dimensions of the crosses and more informationon how they were to be worn. All reconciled heretics, states the relevant law:… shall carry from now on and forever two yellow crosses on all their clothesexcept their shirts, and one arm shall be two palms [8 inches] long while theother transversal arm shall be a palm and a half [6 inches] long, and each shallbe 3 digits [2.25 inches] wide, with one to be worn in front of the chest, andthe other between the shoulders.42 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en583]Required under severe and possibly fatal penalty not to ‘move about eitherinside or outside’ their homes without wearing the crosses, reconciled hereticswere moreover obliged to ‘redo or renew the crosses if they are torn ordestroyed by age.’43 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en584]THE DOMINICAN FLYING SQUADOne gets a sense of the kind of cold, calculating, minds that must have been atwork behind the dreaming-up and enforcement of such regulations – regulationsthat were designed to sever the bonds of warmth and trust that link human beingsone to another. The clear objective was to create an atmosphere of suspicion,blame and jeopardy, and to whip up a frenzy of denouncements by capitalising onpeople's fears of loss of property – and far worse.The following years saw many heretics seized and killed. On one occasion, forexample, shortly after he had taken office as bishop of Toulouse in 1231,Raymond de Fauga was able to gloat over the mass-burning of 19 high-rankingCathar perfecti who had been betrayed, ambushed and captured at one of theirmeetings.44 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en585] De Fauga was aDominican, the monastic order established by the late Saint Dominic with theexplicit purpose of attacking heresy. Since 1215 these austere and zealous monkshad occupied three houses near Toulouse's Narbonne Gate. In 1230, in recognitionof their growing importance, they moved to a new site beside the Saracen Wall.45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en586] By 1234 there were more than 40 ofthem in Toulouse alone and they had established missions in many other parts ofEurope as well.46 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en587]Tremendous recognition, prestige and power had begun to come their way when PopeGregory IX had succeeded Honorius III in 1227. Gregory was unhappy with thesystem so far established in Europe for the suppression of heresy. Thoughprimarily under the control of the bishops, other figures with overlappingresponsibilities were also frequently involved. The result was chaos andinefficiency at a time when attention was beginning to be focussed on thesupposed ‘danger’ posed by Cathar communities in Germany, France and northernItaly, as well as the continuing survival of Catharism in Occitania. With thelinked Bogomil heresy still looking very strong further East, the paranoidtendencies of the Catholic Church went into overdrive and there was a widespreadconviction that enemies were hiding themselves everywhere.The benefit in this for the Dominicans was that in 1231 Pope Gregory appointedthem as his own personal ‘flying inquisition’, superior to the bishops andindependent of them, to discover, arrest, interrogate and condemn GermanCathars. In 1233, seeing the success of their work in Germany, Gregory alsoasked them to do the same job in France and in Occitania .47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en588] Success bred success, triumphfollowed triumph, and soon the Dominicans, aided to some extent by Franciscansand local prelates, had been appointed as the official papal Inquisition,overriding all other authorities in any matter concerning heresy.48[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en589]The term ‘inquisition’ had long been used for the process of extractingconfessions from heretics, and ‘inquisitions’ – interrogations and mass trialsof suspected heretics – were periodically held by the bishops. But this was thefirst time in the history of the Church that officials had been appointed whoseonly function was to conduct inquisitions, who were officially titled‘inquisitors’, and who were responsible directly and exclusively to the pope.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en590]YOU NEVER EXPECT THE SPANISH INQUISITIONWhen we began this research we did not know ourselves that the famed (butmisnamed) ‘Spanish Inquisition’ (subject of a memorable Monty Python sketch) hadfirst been established in April 1233 by Pope Gregory IX. Nor did we know thatthe original and explicit purpose of the Inquisition was to root out and destroythe Cathar heresy. Building on the repressive structures that had already beenfirmly laid down in Occitania, the Dominican inquisitors were empowered after1233 to use virtually any measure they wished to extract confessions and tocrush the Cathar faith. They began at once to institute a reign of terror – trueand awful terror from which no one was safe.A chilling example is provided by the behaviour of Raymond de Fauga, theDominican prior who Pope Gregory IX had appointed as bishop of Toulouse in 1231.A few years later, on 4 August 1235 (by chance the first official feast day forthe recently canonised Saint Dominic) de Fauga held Mass at the order's conventin Toulouse and then made his way to the refectory to take dinner with the othermonks. While he was washing his hands an informer was admitted bringing him atitbit of hot news from his spy-network. In a nearby house an elderly Catharlady lay in a fever and close to death. She was a grande dame of a good familyand had been visited shortly before by a fugitive perfectus who had given herthe consolamentum and then slipped away.50[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en591]Annoyingly, it was too late to catch the perfectus. But the old woman wasn'tgoing anywhere! Joyfully seizing the opportunity to bring another sinner tojustice de Fauga and his fellow Dominicans, dressed only in monks’ habits, lefttheir dinner and hurried at once to the house pinpointed by the informer. It wasvery close, in the Rue de l’Olmet sec, and turned out to belong to a certainPeitivin Brosier who had long been suspected as a Cathar sympathiser.51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en592] The dying woman was hismother-in-law, and as the Dominicans brushed past Brosier into her sick room itseems he only had time to warn her that the ‘lord bishop’ was coming. In herfevered state she unfortunately did not understand that he meant the Catholicbishop of Toulouse and mistook de Fauga for a Cathar bishop.52[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en593]A horrifying scene then unfolded as the Dominican took advantage of the frailold lady's confusion, spoke to her in familiar dualistic terms ‘about contemptfor the world and earthly things’53[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en594] and began to question herconcerning her faith. Having no reason to suspect that she had fallen into thehands of a skilled and unscrupulous impostor, she innocently revealed all herCathar beliefs and confirmed the extent of her attachment to them. De Fauga,whose cynicism was bottomless, even carried the charade so far as to urge her toremain steadfast in these beliefs, admonishing her firmly:… the fear of death should not make you confess aught else than that which youhold firmly in your whole heart.54 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en595]The old woman's honest reply, as one would expect from a dying credente who hadbeen recently consoled, was that she would certainly not lie about her beliefs,and thus obliterate the benefits of the consolamentum she had received, whenthere was so little of her life left to her.55[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en596] For de Fauga, who had everythinghe needed, this was the perfect moment to reveal his true identity. Looming overher bed he pronounced her a heretic and ordered her to recant and embrace theCatholic faith.The old lady was by now fully awake to her predicament and, like many a braveCathar before her, refused to recant. De Fauga and the other Dominicans insistedthat she must. The badgering went on for some time in front of a growing numberof witnesses who had crowded in from the neighbourhood, all keen to see how thiswas going to end. Finally, since his victim ‘persevered with increasingstubbornness in her heretical alliance’,56[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en597] de Fauga decided to ‘relax her tothe secular arm’ – the Church's usual euphemism for having local civilauthorities do the dirty work of executing a heretic.57[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en598] In this case, to speed things up,a magistrate had already been called and now legally sentenced the dying womanto death!58 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en599]Runners were despatched to prepare a huge fire at the public execution ground, aplace called Pre du Comte (the count's meadow), and word of the spectacle wassent out all over Toulouse attracting a large crowd. For the old woman it musthave seemed a vision straight from hell, exactly what her beloved Cathar Churchhad always told her this world was anyway. Since she was quite unable to walk,the Dominicans had ordered her to be tied to her bed. She had then been carriedout of her son-in-law's house, bed and all, and brought to this place. Now,after refusing one more chance to recant, she was thrown into the raging flamesand burnt alive.‘This done’, concludes William Pelisson, one of the witnesses to these eventsand himself a Dominican inquisitor who entirely approved of de Fauga'sactions:59 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en600]The Bishop, together with the monks and their attendants, returned to therefectory and giving thanks to God and the Blessed Dominic, ate with rejoicingwhat had been prepared for them.60 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en601]One wonders what happened to the old woman's son-in-law, Peitivin Brosier. Allwe know from Pelisson's cheerful account is that he was arrested.61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en602] Under the rules of the Inquisitionin force at the time it is unlikely that he would have survived his subsequent –inevitable – interrogation without recanting the Cathar faith, acceptingCatholicism fully and informing on his friends. Even then he would have remaineda prisoner in close confinement for the rest of his life. All other members ofhis family, as well as all his known associates and all members of his wife'sfamily and all their known associates would have been interrogated and theirstatements cross-referred to detect any inconsistencies that might expose otherheretics amongst them.And of course, since he'd sheltered his mother-in-law – a proven heretic – itgoes without saying that his house in the Rue de l’Olmet sec would have beenrazed to the ground.That was just the way the Inquisition worked.PARADOXWhen William Pelisson concluded his congratulatory report of the trapping andbrutal murder of a helpless old lady, he modestly expressed the view that such agreat achievement should not be credited to the Dominicans alone:God performed these works … to the glory and praise of His name … to theexaltation of the faith and to the discomfiture of the heretics.62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en603]Reading these sentiments, we find ourselves – not for the first time – overtakenby the sense of a really weird ‘disconnect’ between the words and the deeds ofCatholic holy men like Pelisson. He was part of a Christian gang that had justdone the most awful thing – something really psychotic and unbelievably cruel –to a fellow human being. But instead of being ashamed of such wickedness, he wasproud of it and felt that it glorified his God! Nowhere in the New Testament isit possible to find justification for such behaviour, so which God did he thinkhe was talking about?Once again the sense of disconnect goes away if we look at the whole scene froma Cathar perspective. Then the vile deeds of the Dominicans make perfect sense.Of course they acted as they did. Of course they took delight in the pain andsuffering of the old lady. Theirs was the church of the God of Evil. What elsewould you expect of them?We're only half serious … Who's to say that there's even such an entity as ‘God’at all, let alone Good and Evil Gods? Since there will never be any certainty onsuch matters this side of the grave, all we can do is weigh up the competingtheories and compare them with the behaviour of the participants. When we dothat it is clear that Cathar theology provides an internally consistentexplanation for why the Catholic Church burnt people at the stake and butcheredthe populations of whole cities. No such internally consistent explanation isforthcoming from Catholic theology; on the contrary the massacres and the manyacts of prolonged, deliberate cruelty that the Catholic Church was responsiblefor represent a profound and inexplicable paradox when set against the teachingsof Christ. 1.

The first twoofficial inquisitors in Occitania, Peter Seila and William Arnold, both of whomwere recruited from amongst the Dominicans of Toulouse, were appointed by PopeGregory IX in late 1233.63 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en604] Likeall natural bureaucracies with high-level backing the Inquisition grewunrestrainedly. By the end of the decade numerous different teams of inquisitorslike Seila and Arnold were at work throughout Occitania interrogating,cross-referencing, condemning and burning. From the beginning they were a lawunto themselves, independent both of the bishops and the civil authorities, withunlimited authority to act against heretics.Their standard methodology was deliberately intimidating, designed to spreadterror in any community they descended upon and to ‘drive a wedge into thefaçade of community solidarity, so that the loyalties and fears which had heldit together could be undermined.’64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en605] Task forces, typically led by oneor two inquisitors supported by an attendant band of soldiers, clerks andmagistrates, roamed the land going from village to village, town to town, cityto city. The idea, was that each unit should be self-sufficient as detective,gaoler, judge, jury and executioner, identifying suspected heretics and‘processing’ them from freedom either to repentance or the stake in as short atime as possible.Methods of operation were constantly refined in response to the latest evasionsand escape plans of the heretics, although by the 1240s large parts of theprocedure had been standardised and written up by the Dominicans in a series ofdetailed technical manuals. From these we learn that in each parish theInquistion would begin with a public meeting which the entire local communitywould be required to attend. Once everyone was assembled the inquisitor wouldappear and address them with a general sermon condemning the Cathar heresy. Thennotice was served on all males over 14 and all females over 12 (‘or younger ifperchance they shall have been guilty of an offence’)65[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en606] to appear individually before theinquisitor over the coming days. If no previous inquisition had visited theparish an announcement would be made granting:… indulgence from imprisonment to all from that place who have not been cited byname or who have not yet earned the indulgence, if within a specified time, theycome voluntarily as penitents to tell the exact and full truth about themselvesand about others.66 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en607]In other words, those who pre-emptively informed on themselves or others, andwere willing to recant their heresy, would earn exemption from punishment,perhaps even escape punishment altogether. By contrast those who knew something– anything – and decided to keep quiet about it were taking an immense risk thattheir neighbours or friends might inform on them. If that were to happen theywould be judged to have misled the Inquisition – an offence for which extremepenalties applied.67 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en608] In suchcircumstances, notes the historian Martin Barber:The temptation to denounce others was almost overwhelming, if only for defensivereasons … In a community that had had frequent contact with heretics … nobodywas likely to be innocent in the eyes of the Church, and therefore anybody couldhave been written into the Inquisitors’ copious records.68[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en609]The atmosphere of mutual suspicion was increased – together with the likelihoodof denunciations – by the way that all the parishioners were then interrogated,one by one, with no opportunity for the others waiting in line to hear what wasbeing said by their neighbours. Again and again these in camera interviewsproved to have an unnerving effect, demoralising communities all acrossOccitania, turning their attention inwards on themselves in a most negativemanner, and weakening their will to cooperate in a fightback.69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en610]Indeed the Inquisition's sweeping powers had set aside at a stroke all theancient legal safeguards that had formerly protected individual rights inmedieval society. An example was the right for the accused to be representedwhilst undergoing interrogation. Theoretically even the Inquisition had to abideby this. In practice, however, no accused heretic was ever represented as hestood before the inquisitors. This was because any lawyer foolish enough todefend an accused heretic would immediately have been suspected and accused ofheresy himself. Once that happened (accusation was enough; he didn't have to befound guilty) his arguments would have become inadmissible and he would havestood in immediate jeopardy of his own life.70[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en611]The idea of undergoing the full process of interrogation by the Inquisitionwould have been a terrifying prospect whether one were a heretic or not.Questioning was inexorable and, on top of an array of psychological techniques,it's known that the inquisitors routinely used torture to extract confessionslong before the pope gave his official blessing for them to do so in 1252.71[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en612] Between the torture andinterrogation sessions, the accused would be confined in deeply uncomfortableconditions intended to undermine his will further. Cells of the ‘little-ease’variety – in which the prisoner had room neither to sit, stand up or lie down –are reported to have been particularly favoured by the inquisitors. Otherdevices included keeping cells knee-deep in water, or permanently dark, starvingprisoners, and shackling them hand and foot in heavy chains.In the most recalcitrant cases such interrogations could continue over periodsof months or even years.72 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en613]However, once a confession had been extracted and a judgement made, the chancesin law of reversing it were about zero – even if the judgement were manifestlyfaulty. Since appeals were not allowed the inquisitors literally held the powersof life and death in their hands, without any checks or balances.73[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en614] They were amongst their enemiesand could do what they liked to them. The consequence was that many Cathars wereburnt at the stake, many who recanted on pain of death nevertheless remainedimprisoned for life, and countless numbers of those who may not even have beenCathars themselves but who had at one time or another spoken to a Cathar, or hadsome other such trivial contact with the heresy, were exiled from their homelandfor years fulfilling arduous pilgrimages imposed on them by the Inquisition.74[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en615]BURNING THE LIVING AND THE DEADSeila and Arnold, the first two inquisitors, were the prototypes of a ruthlessbreed who would continue to rend the enemies of Catholicism for another sixcenturies. Soon after taking office they were able to arrange a spectaculardemonstration of the efficient spy-network already at their disposal when theysucceeded in trapping and arresting Vigoros de Baconia one of the leading Catharperfecti in Toulouse. He was summarily tried, condemned and burnt alive.75[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en616]During the two years from 1233 to 1235 the two inquisitors initiated what hasbeen described as a ‘veritable reign of terror’, first in Toulouse and then farand wide throughout Occitania.76 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en617]Burnings of individuals and small groups became commonplace and on a number ofoccasions there were larger catches to be had. In 1234 for example, on theirvery first visit to Moissac, Seila and Arnold presided over the mass burning of210 Cathar perfecti who they had condemned as ‘contumacious heretics’.77[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en618]Keeping a record as ever, the faithful Dominican commentator William Pelissontells us that with this splendid auto-da-fé:… great fear was aroused among the heretics and their believers in that land.78[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en619]More fear was on the way the following year, 1235, when a general inquisitionwas held in Toulouse on Good Friday. Voluntary mass confessions occurred aspeople rushed to implicate themselves and others before someone else did.Threatened with execution one Cathar sympathiser avoided the stake by taking thecity magistrate and the inquisitors to a place where 10 perfecti were in hiding:three managed to escape; the other seven were burnt.79[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en620]During 1234 and 1235 large numbers of new inquisitors had been appointed fromamongst the Dominicans but even so had proved insufficient to the task ofinterrogation, filing and cross-referencing that the cult of mass confessionshad now generated. Franciscans and parish priests were therefore conscripted tohelp.80 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en621] Adding to the overallburden was the matter of the paperwork from earlier investigations of heresy bythe episcopal and other authorities. Undertaken before the Inquistion had beenformed, and going back as far as 1209, these investigations had producedinformation, tip-offs and denunciations which the years of war had made it hardto follow up. Now the Inquisition was determined to make good the deficit.On examination of the older records, and the full cross-referencing of allstatements, it became clear that many who had formerly been exonerated as goodCatholics had in fact been heretics all along. Those still living were arrestedand burnt alive. But the remains of those who had already died during theintervening years were not forgotten! Wherever they had been buried they wouldbe assiduously sought out and exhumed so that they too could be burnt.81[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en622] Sometimes whole piles ofmouldering disarticulated skeletons would be brought in at once, paraded throughthe streets and then burnt in a heap.82[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en623]Such severely demented behaviour (shall we call it necropyria?) would requireurgent psychiatric restraint today. In Occitania in the 1230s and the 1240s itwas lauded by the Church but naturally caused much anger amongst the relativesof the deceased who were publicly shamed in this way. A particular source ofresentment was that the property of posthumously-condemned heretics was subjectto confiscation, just as it would be if the heretic were still alive, which hadthe effect of impoverishing his descendants.83[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en624] Inevitably the civilian populationbegan to hate the inquisitors. In one case, in the city of Albi, an inquisitornamed Arnald Cathala was beaten up and nearly killed by an angry mob after hewent personally to exhume the corpse of an old women, recently revealed as aheretic, who had passed away some years before.84[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en625]Even by the late 1230s and early 1240s, despite being the focus of a concerted,well-funded, well-staffed Church operation to wipe them out to the last man,there were still sufficient numbers of Cathar perfecti in circulation – and ablewith local support to evade the inquisitors – to keep the heresy alive. Evidenceof this astonishing persistence in the face of extreme adversity comes from thesheer number of penances still being imposed on convicted heretics. Over justtwo and a half months in 1241 – 42 Peter Seila, (the reader will recall him asthe first inquisitor to be appointed in 1233) imposed penances on 732 hereticsin nine different locations.85 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en626]THE FALL OF MONTSÉGUROne amongst several reasons for the longevity of Catharism in Occitania was thatthe heretics were able to hold onto their major fortress of Montségur for manyyears after the French occupation of 1229. It provided a place of refuge towhich perfecti could flee to rest and recuperate after risky missions in theoccupied territories and its symbolic importance as a symbol of hope andresistance was vast. Its walls were high, believed impregnable, and it stood ontop of a remote and inaccessible rocky crag.In May 1242 two of the most loathed inquisitors, the Dominican William Arnold(again one of the original appointees back in 1233) and the Franciscan Stephenof Saint-Thibery, arrived in the little town of Avignonet with their hit-squadof enforcers. They had been on the road for seven months conducting generalinquisitions across most of the region from Lavaur in the north to Fanjeaux inthe south and spreading the usual tidal wave of terror wherever they went. Nowit was Avignonet's turn.86 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en627]Except on this occasion it wasn't. The local bailiff, Raymond of Alfaro, was aCathar sympathiser and immediately sent word by fast teams of riders toMontségur, 70 kilometers to the south. There the lord of the castle, one PeterRoger of Mirepoix, decided, to take action. On the night of 28 May 1242 hearrived at Avignonet with a group of heavily-armed knights who massacred theentire inquisitorial team of 10. Later one of the assassins, William Golarian,explained that they had mounted the attack so that ‘the affair of theInquisition could be extinguished and the whole land would be free, and therewould not be another Inquisition.’87[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en628]Talk about wishful thinking! Far from extinguish the Inquisition, Avignonetproved to be the catalyst that led to Montségur being placed under siege by theforces of the French king – now the young Louis IX (who, as one might expect ofa future Catholic saint, prosecuted heretics mercilessly). The siege began inMay 1243 and ended, after 10 months of violent assaults and bombardments, withthe surrender of Montségur, in March 1244.Rather more than 200 Cathar perfecti had taken refuge there, including BertrandMarty who had the rank of bishop. Eyewitness reports tell us that on 17 March1244 they were all ‘brutally dragged forth from the fortress of Montségur.’88[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en629] Further down the slope, on a levelarea, a large rectangular enclosure defined by a wooden palisade had been filledup with firewood, straw and pitch. Now, without ceremony, soldiers set light tothe piled firewood and the wretched heretics were thrown in a mass inside thepalisade. ‘There,’ as one commentator of the period assures us, ‘theyexperienced the fire of Hell.’89 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en630]THE LAST CATHARSMontségur was a catastrophe, but still it did not mark the end of Catharism.Through the remainder of the 1240s the struggle between Inquisition and hereticswent on and there were many more executions. In 1245 – 46, for example, theInquistion of Toulouse had to deal with cases involving more than 600 villagesand towns.90 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en631] In one of thesevillages for which more detailed records are available, Mas-Saintes-Puelles (tothe west of Castelnaudry), we know that a staggering total of 420 suspectedheretics, roughly two-thirds of the population, were interrogated by InquisitorsBernard of Caux and John of St. Pierre. This information has come down to us intwo of the Inquisition's original registers detailing the interrogations of morethan 5,500 different people from 104 different places. It is known that therewere originally 10 registers.91 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en632]Gripped in the cold, dead hand of such a powerful, vindictive, and impressivelywell-organised bureaucracy, the Cathar heresy began to falter and then slowly todie. By the 1250s the Inquisitor Rainer Sacconi was able to estimate withsatisfaction that there were not more than 200 perfecti left in all ofOccitania92 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en633] – too small a number,reckons historian Joseph Strayer, ‘to preserve the structure of the CatharChurch.’93 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en634] As a result, though theheresy was to persist into the next century, it had been so reduced by theInquisition that it no longer represented a danger to Catholicism.94[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en635]The last upsurge was focussed around the highlands of the county of Foix – anold centre of the resistance. Here in 1299 a perfectus named Pierre Autier,together with a small group of followers began to evangelise amongst the ruggedfarmers and shepherds of the region. For a few brief years he enjoyed greatsuccess and even set in motion something of a revival, but he never really stooda chance. Soon the inquisitors were after him – big names like Bernard Gui,Geoffrey d’Ablis and Jacques Fournier. In 1309, with utter inevitability, Autierwas caught. We know that he then underwent 10 months of interrogation by theinquisitors who finally burnt him alive in 1310.One more prominent perfectus remained to be executed, a certain WilliamBelibaste. Finding the going too hot in Occitania he had become a refugee in asmall Cathar community across the border in Spain. There he was reached by anagent provocateur from the Inquisition who worked himself into his confidenceand eventually tricked him into making a short return visit to Occitania. Whenhe did so in the spring of 1321 he was captured, thrown into irons, tried andcondemned. In the autumn of 1321 he was burnt at the stake.95[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en636]He was the last of the estimated 5,000 Cathar perfecti who were formally burntalive in the name of the Christian God during the 112 years following the startof the Albigensian Crusades in 1209.96[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en637] He was also the last Cathar knownto history.A QUIET NATURAL DEATH?Probably the heresy did survive for a few more years in some remote pockets ofOccitania to be rooted out by inquisitions too small to have been reported byanyone. But the apocalypse at Montségur in 1244, the long downhill journeythereafter, and the demise of Autier and Belibaste in 1310 and 1321, really didmark the end of it.Numerous Cathars fled Occitania. As well as nearby parts of Spain, whereBelibaste would have done well to stay, another favoured refuge close to homewas amongst their co-religionists in northern Italy. But the inquisitors were atwork there too. In November 1276 all members of the Cathar community of Sirmionewere arrested. And in February 1278 ‘about 200’ were rounded up and burnt inVerona – the headquarters in exile of the Toulousan Cathar Church.97[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en638]Longer-term it seemed like the only secure refuge was in the ancient ByzantineEmpire where the Bogomils, the mother church of Catharism, remained relativelystrong during much of the 14th century. As late as 1325, four years afterBelibaste had perished at the stake, we find Pope John XXI complaining to theleader of Bosnia about the heretics who are fleeing to his country and takingshelter there.98 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en639]Indeed although lands in the Byzantine Empire did not strictly-speaking comeunder the jurisdiction of the pope in Rome, but of the patriarchate inConstantinople, there had been constant papal interference in this part of theworld since the early 13th century – round about the same time that theAlbigensian Crusades began in the west.99[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en640] For example Pope Gregory IX, whocreated the Inquisition in 1233 to smash the Cathars, deposed the Catholicbishop to Bosnia at around the same time for failing to take action against theBogomils and replaced him, significantly, with a Dominican. Gregory alsodeclared a crusade against Bosnia to root out heresy there. The crusade, whichcontinued until 1240, was willingly led by the Duke of Croatia. ‘In practice,’notes Bernard Hamilton, ‘this was a Hungarian war against Bosnia that was givenCrusade status …’100 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en641] On anotheroccasion, in 1238, the pope incited his ally King Bela IV of Hungary to mount acrusade against Bulgaria as well. Any possibility that this might go ahead,however, was stopped by the Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1241 – 42.101[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en642]By the 14th century the Ottoman Turks were on the move, eating up andincorporating into their Islamic state many areas of the former ByzantineEmpire. They conquered Bulgaria in 1393 and thereafter Bogomilism was neverheard of again in that land; indeed the last surviving report of BulgarianBogomilism comes to us from no later than 1370.102[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en643] It lasted longer in Bosnia but wasfinally wiped out there after the invasion of Sultan Mehmed II (called the‘Conqueror’) in 1463.103 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en644] By theend of the 15th century the population of Bosnia was almost entirely Muslim.104[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en645] As the historian Malcolm Lamberthas researched:After a major expenditure of effort on refutation and, above all, police work,the Cathars were finally put down by the Western Church; by contrast ByzantineBogomilism died a quiet natural death …105[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en646]Though the Inquisition never reached the wild lands of Bulgaria and Bosnia, itsbrutal success in Occitania, and the growing numbers of Cathars fleeing east totell of horrors they had witnessed, must have been profoundly discouraging forthe whole Bogomil movement. This perhaps explains the loss in energy thatbecomes apparent in Bogomilism from the early 14th century onwards – afterwhich, though still thriving in the East, it seems to have abandoned all senseof its world mission. The Muslims brought about its final demise but evenwithout their role the Catholic and Orthodox Churches had by then become sovigilant concerning heresy that there would have been no second chance for theBogomil faith to evangelise and gain converts in the Christian world.After Occitania was lost, all was lost. The millennial opportunity had come, andbeen seized, and then snatched away. An ancient Gnostic religion offering astark alternative vision of Christianity had mysteriously reappeared aftercenturies in darkness, flourished mightily at first and made a bid foruniversality, only to fail utterly in the end …Or had it?RENAISSANCEIn the summer of 1460, shortly before the last embers of the Bogomil faith werestamped out by Sultan Mehmed II’s invasion of Bosnia, a Tuscan monk namedLeonardo da Pistoia rode unobtrusively into the Florence on a donkey.

He had been away forseveral months on a dangerous mission to Macedonia for his learned and immenselywealthy master, Cosimo de’Medici, the Doge of Florence, who employed him toprocure rare and ancient writings. Already a vast library of extraordinaryscrolls, codices and books had been built up. Yet Leonardo knew that Cosimowould remain dissatisfied until he had in his hands certain very specific andonce widely-circulated books suppressed by the Church and lost to the world forclose to a thousand years. Cosimo was convinced that these books must stillexist somewhere – and had ordered Leonardo to seek them out and buy them nomatter what the cost.Now at last, after returning many times to Florence with lesser prizes, Leonardotook great pride in the fact that he had found the ancient books that his mastersought. They were books of knowledge, purported to have come down from Thoth,the wisdom god of the Egyptians, who had been known to the Greeks as HermesTrismegistus. And though neither Leonardo nor Cosimo were aware of this, thesehighly mysterious Hermetic texts had been compiled in Alexandria during thefirst three centuries of the Christian era, i.e. at the same time and in thesame place as the Nag Hammadi Gnostic texts. The link between the twocollections becomes even stronger when we realise that a fragment of one of theHermetic texts that Leonardo had purchased – a document known as the Asclepius –was also reproduced amongst the Gnostic codices buried at Nag Hammadi in thelate fourth century and not recovered until 1945.1[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en647]THE BODY IS A TOMBNo one can dispute that the Roman Catholic Church has a long trackrecord ofvigorous opposition to all forms of knowledge, scripture, enquiry, wisdom andreligious self-expression that do not accord with its own views. The reader willrecall that it was mobs of Christians, aroused by Theophilus, the Catholicarchbishop of Alexandria, who sacked the Serapeum in Alexandria in AD 391. Theykilled all the ‘pagans’ and Gnostics who had taken shelter inside it and razedto the ground the wonderful library that had been arranged around its cloisterstogether with its entire irreplaceable collection of ancient books and scrolls.We saw in Chapter Five that this atrocity was just one amongst many in theruthless suppression of Gnosticism and paganism by the Catholic Church, and itsgenerally very efficient destruction of their texts and traditions.A different expression of this same antagonism to knowledge outside the narrowband accepted by orthodoxy was the closure in AD 529 by the Christian EmperorJustinian of Plato's revered Academy in Athens.2[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en648] Originally established by Platohimself in the 380s BC on a site a mile outside Athens that was already heldsacred, the Academy enjoyed more than 900 years of continuous existence untilJustinian and Christian bigotry shut it down for spreading ‘pagan’ ideas.Today we do not know exactly what was taught at the Academy. However, Plato'sown copious surviving writings have led the majority of scholars to infer thatthe original syllabus was designed to produce a select few wise philosophers,deeply knowledgeable in mathematics (including the theory of harmonics andastronomy), dialectics, natural science, and political theory3[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en649] who would:… leave the Academy for politics, not as power seekers themselves but tolegislate or advise those in power.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en650]It is known that the great Christian Gnostic teacher Valentinus, an Egyptian,studied Platonic philosophy at Alexandria in the early second century AD,5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en651] so it is perhaps not surprising tofind the Catholic apologist Hippolytus (AD 170 – 236) accusing the Gnostics ofbeing ‘disciples of Plato’ and following the Platonic system in making‘arithmetical science the fundamental principle of their doctrine.’6[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en652] For our purposes it is alsointeresting that Plato seems to have been the first to use the term demiurge –Greek for ‘public craftsman’ – to describe the creator of the material world. Inexactly the manner later copied by the Gnostics he meant to imply that thecreator was a subordinate power, not the true God,7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en653] and that the material world was acorrupt, imperfect copy of the ideal world.8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en654] Tim Freke and Peter Gandy pointout that Plato also frequently liked to quote a common phrase of the paganmystery religions of his period – that phrase being soma sema, ‘the body is atomb’:Gnostic initiates also understood that those who identified with the incarnatephysical self were spiritually dead and needed to be reborn into eternal Life …9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en655]It is beyond the scope of this book to present a full exposition of thesimilarities – and the differences – between Platonism and Gnosticism. The pointwe wish to make is simply that the suppression of Plato's Academy in AD 529 waspart of a much wider attack on the pursuit of knowledge that also included thevirtual destruction of Christian Gnosticism – until, we propose, it resurfacedin Bulgaria in the 10th century as Bogomilism. During the intervening centuriesbook burning was deemed an act of piety by the Church and the persecution ofscholars who ventured outside strict ecclesiastical boundaries was deemed an actof righteousness and a service to God.THE ENRAGED ENFORCEMENT OF AN UNEARNED SPIRITUAL MONOPOLYIt is with good reason that historians refer to the period between the 5th andthe 10th centuries AD as the Dark Ages. But things were to get much darkerbefore European culture was to see any lasting glimmers of light. We'vedocumented aspects of the astonishing ‘mini-Renaissance’ that accompanied thesudden upsurge of Catharism in Occitania in the 12th century. And we'vedocumented the reaction of the Church – the Albigensian Crusades that laid wastethe cultural development of the region, a century of terrorism and mayhem, theholocaust of 5,000 Cathar perfecti, and, last but not least, the Inquisition.It should be obvious to the reader by now that Cathars and Catholics had verydifferent attitudes to the uses and control of knowledge, and that theseattitudes were rooted in their very different underlying philosophies.For the Cathars, inheritors of the Gnostic tradition, the predicament ofhumanity was ignorance; it was knowledge, therefore, that would provide the onlysure route of escape. And since they believed that the greatest store ofrelevant knowledge was contained in the New Testament – the fundamental documentof Christianity – they felt strongly that every Cathar should be able to read itin his or her own language.Accordingly the Cathars of Occitania had the New Testament translated fromLatin, in which it had hitherto been locked away from the masses, into thevernacular langue d'oc, and large numbers of copies, laboriously prepared byhand, were put into circulation. The demand for a cheap convenient material onwhich such copies could be made led them to become the pioneers of paper-makingin Europe, establishing numerous apprenticeships in the new trade10[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en656] and contributing greatly to thesubsequent spread of this liberating technology.In parallel, Cathar children were taught to read and study the New Testamentfrom an early age, thus gaining the gift of literacy that was so rare in generalin Europe in that period. Rare too was the fact that both sexes were taughtequally, not just the males as was often the norm elsewhere.11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en657] The result was that educated,literate, free-thinking women became a feature of Cathar communities during theshort period that the heresy flourished.In this, as in many other respects, the behaviour of the Cathars can only bedescribed as enlightened – no other word will do – while their campaign toprovide accessible vernacular editions of the New Testament was clearly aninitiative far ahead of its time. By contrast the reader will recall fromChapter Seven that the Catholic Church and the Inquisition strictly forbade laypersons to possess the New Testament ‘with the exception of the Psalter, theBreviary, and the Book of Hours of the Blessed Virgin’. Moreover even theselimited selections were permitted only in Latin whilst translations into the‘vernacular tongue’ were ‘rigorously forbidden’.12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en658]It seems ironic that the so-called heretics were the ones doing everything theycould to spread knowledge of the New Testament while the ‘true Church’ was doingeverything it could to limit and control such knowledge. But to understand thisbehaviour we need only remind ourselves of the basic philosophy of Catholicism –which utterly opposes any personal quest for knowledge and instead teaches blindfaith and absolute mindless trust in the infallibility of papal dogma. It wasthis doctrine that snuffed out the brilliant light of scientific and spiritualenquiry that had flourished around the great libraries of Alexandria during thelast three centuries BC and the first three centuries AD. It was this doctrinethat plunged the world into the Dark Ages by suppressing not only Gnosticenquiry but also the vast bulk of ‘pagan’ classical knowledge. And it was thissame doctrine of blind faith and unquestioning obedience – still top of theCatholic agenda a thousand years later – that led directly to the gross moralerrors of the Albigensian Crusades and the Inquisition in the 13th and 14thcenturies, and to yet more suppression of books and knowledge, more burning ofheretics, more terror and stupidity.By the 15th century, though the persecution of individual heretics was far fromover, European society was exhausted and sickened by all this mad violence,censorship and bigotry. By then, too, with the complete destruction of theCathar threat well behind it, the vigilance of the Church itself had inevitablybegun to slacken. Not quite certain what sort of backlash they might ultimatelyincur – but willing to take the risk – certain open-minded scholars tookadvantage of the lull to begin a quest for ancient manuscripts. Their frank hopewas that by rediscovering the lost wisdom of the past they might better guidethe world towards its unknown future.One such scholar was Cosimo de’Medici who employed the monk Leonardo de Pistoiaas his bookfinder. Now riding into Florence on the back of the little donkeythat had carried him all the way from Macedonia, Leonardo anxiously fumbled inthe bundle strapped at his side and felt once again the reassuring outline andweight of the miraculous, wonderful books that he was bringing to his master.A PHILOSOPHER WITH FIRE-POWERThe origin of the House of Medici is obscure, but ‘Medici’ means literally‘medical doctors’ so a background amongst physicians and apothecaries is thoughtlikely. Further back the family's ancestry may have included a humble charcoalburner who had moved into Florence from the nearby district of Mugello. But anapocryphal origin added much colour to their name. Legend had it that the familyhad been founded in the fifth century by a brave knight who came to Mugello andhelpfully killed a fearsome giant who had been plaguing the local population. Asa reward he was allowed to add to his shield eight red balls, one for each ofthe dents from the giant's attack. These red balls, others have suggested,either represented apothecaries’ pills or coins of the famous banking familythat the Medici would later become.Since 1239 the Medici had been official gonfaloniere of Florence (standardbearers and custodians of the city banner). By 1389, the year Cosimo was born,the family was already prominent and rich due to the banking activities ofCosimo's father, Giovanni. He had apparently benefited greatly from his personalfriendship with Pope John XXIII, Baldassare Cossa, who later, in 1414, was to beaccused of heresy, simony, tyranny, the murder of his predecessor Pope AlexanderV, and the seduction of no less than 200 girls and ladies of Bologna!13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en659]Named after Saint Cosmas, on whose feast day – 27 September – he had been born,Cosimo was educated at the Camaldolese monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli,where he learnt French, German and Latin and a spatter of Hebrew, Greek andArabic. In his teens he attended the lectures and lessons of one of the mostprominent scholars in Florence, Roberto de’Rossi, also a member of an old andrich Florentine family. Through the influence of de’Rossi the young Cosimoacquired and developed a lasting respect and love for classical works,particularly Plato, and an insatiable interest in man's role and purpose onearth. In short, he was a philosopher in the ancient mould who, as it would turnout, would acquire the sort of fire-power that few lovers of wisdom ever enjoy.Through political machinations and more especially through his influence on thepapacy (he had befriended the popes and practically ran the finances of theVatican), Cosimo was able to add greatly to the already enormous wealth of theHouse of Medici. His influence grew accordingly and he was soon the de factoruler of Florence, a position that he was to maintain for the rest of his life.In 1458, just two years before the lost texts of the Hermetica were delivered tohim, Cosimo was described as ‘master of the country’ by Pope Pious II:Political questions are settled in his house. The man he chooses holds office …He it is who decides peace and war and controls the laws … He is king ineverything but name.14 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en660]The Florentine historian, Francesco Guicciardini, went even further when he saidthat Cosimo ‘had a reputation such as probably no private citizen has everenjoyed from the fall of Rome to our own day.’15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en661]ALL THE LEARNING OF CONSTANTINOPLE AND A NEW PLATONIC ACADEMYIn 1438 Cosimo came up with a brilliant idea that, in a curious and indirectway, was to change the course of Western scholarship. For centuries, as thereader will recall, the Catholic Church, headed by the pope in Rome, had been inconflict over doctrinal issues with the Eastern Orthodox Church, headed by thepatriarch in Constantinople. This great religious ‘West versus East’ schismreached a crisis point in the 1430s when Constantinople was beginning to beseriously threatened by the Muslim Ottoman Turks. Since the dramatic fall ofEgypt and Alexandria to the Muslims in AD 642, the ‘Eastern’ empire of Rome,which extended from Turkey through to Egypt, had been slowly gnawed away by theMuslim forces. By 1438, all that remained in Christian hands was its capital,Constantinople, called the ‘Second Rome’. In the famous words of Mehmed II, theOttoman sultan who would eventually capture the city in 1452 after a siege ofsix weeks, it was just ‘a monstrous head without a body’.In 1438 John Paleologus, the Eastern Roman emperor whose seat wasConstantinople, appealed to the pope in the name of all Christianity formilitary help to save the last bastion of Christendom in the East from fallinginto the hands of the Muslims. In response, Pope Eugenius IV decided to call fora great council to meet somewhere in Italy. Cosimo de’Medici, seeing theenormous prestige such a council would bring, especially if it achieved areconciliation between the Eastern and Western churches, was determined that thevenue should be his own city. Through his friendship with the pope, and byoffering to cover all expenses plus a generous loan to the Vatican, Cosimo hadhis way, and in the winter of 1439, after a night of storms and torrentialrains, the Eastern emperor, the Greek Orthodox patriarch and the pope all madetheir triumphal entries into Florence.Months of deliberations and ecumenical debates followed until at last, in July1439, the Council of Florence reached a compromise that brought the two churchestogether again. Predictably their reunification was short-lived; indeed theEastern delegates barely had time to return to Constantinople before repudiatingthe feeble agreement. But there was an unexpected upside. Florence, all ofItaly, and in due course the rest of Western Europe as well, were to benefitincalculably from the exciting intellectual stimulant provided by the largeretinue of Byzantine-Greek scholars who had accompanied the Eastern emperor tothe council. These scholars were amongst the prime catalysts in the remarkableRenaissance of classical history, art and philosophy that was soon to follow andthey added new force to the already keen and burning interest of Cosimode’Medici in Plato's works. The great Byzantine scholar, Bessarion, who hadaccompanied the Eastern emperor to Italy, was persuaded to remain behind, aswell as his colleague Plethon, a leading authority on Plato.16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en662]After attending lectures by Plethon, Cosimo had another inspiration. He woulduse some of his immense wealth to establish a Platonic Academy in Florence,modelled on Plato's original. Plethon's departure, and Cosimo's involvement withother issues, delayed the project for several years. Nonetheless the idea of theAcademy did finally come to maturity. Its first home was the Villa Montevecchioin Florence and Cosimo appointed his adopted son, the brilliant scholar MarsilioFicino, as its first director. Ficino had, in fact, been groomed for such a taskby Cosimo over the years after noting the young man's keen enthusiasm forPlato's works, and it was Cosimo who had generously paid for Ficino's educationand for his special studies in Greek and Latin.Cosimo had for many years been an avid collector of rare and important books andmade some valuable additional acquisitions from the Byzantine-Greek scholars whohad attended the 1439 Council of Florence. His library, regarded as the mostextensive collection of classical and religious works in Europe, formed thenucleus of the Medici Academy and was to serve eventually as a model for theVatican's own library. Until 1460, however, the ultimate prize – the fabledworks of Hermes Trismegistus – had eluded him as well as all other collectors inEurope.Travel-stained and weary, the monk Leonardo da Pistoia now calmly directed hislittle donkey into the Villa Careggi, the sumptuous residence of Cosimode’Medici in Florence. He was admitted at once and delivered the bundle that hehad carried so far directly to Cosimo himself.OLDER THAN MOSES, GREATER THAN PLATOIt was well known to European scholars of the Renaissance that the great Greekphilosopher Plato, and before him Solon and Pythagoras, had visited the land ofEgypt and there had allegedly learnt the wisdom of the Egyptian sages. Plato, itwas said, had special respect for the Egyptians – who he referred to as a ‘raceof philosophers’.17 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en663] In his Timeus,famous for containing the earliest-surviving direct references to Atlantis, herecounted a story that had supposedly been told by Solon, the celebratedAthenian statesman and poet, after the latter had visited Egypt circa 600 BC.There, at Sais in the Delta area, Egyptian priests at the Temple of Neithapparently recognised Solon's wisdom and agreed to discuss with him issuesrelated to the origin of the world. After listening to Solon expounding some ofthe Greek myths, however, one of the priests interrupted him and exclaimed:O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are all like children, and there is no such thing asan old [wise] Greek … You are all young in mind … you have no belief rooted inancient tradition and no knowledge hoary with age …18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en664]Solon apparently was told by the Egyptian priests that deluges and fire hadperiodically ravaged the earth, causing civilisations to collapse and disappear.However, because of the disposition of the Nile Valley, Egypt had miraculouslybeen spared and all her ancient temples and sanctuaries had survived. In themand them alone was preserved a complete memory of the great events of thedistant past and of deeds previously accomplished by mankind. They evencontained a record of the origins of the world and knowledge of that golden agewhen mortals had fraternised with the gods.Classical writers who had visited or lived in Egypt, such as Herodotus, DiodorusSiculus and Proclus Diadochus, likewise extolled the immensely old wisdom of theEgyptian priests, and especially their revered knowledge of the heavens and themotion of the stars. Many deemed Egypt a sacred land, a land in which the godshad once dwelt and taught men the divine and sacred science, and where thesecrets of immortality had been revealed to those who were fully worthy.19[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en665] However, this wonderful andpristine Egyptian science had thus far remained out of the reach of Renaissancescholars such as Cosimo de’Medici because it was written in the mysterious andimpenetrable hieroglyphic language which no one anymore could understand.Ancient and holy Egypt had fallen into a deep coma from which, it seemed, itmight never again awake.One can therefore imagine the intellectual shockwave that passed through thelearned circles of Florence in 1460 when Cosimo de’Medici excitedly announcedthat he had in his possession a collection, translated by some unknown hand intoGreek, of the fabled lost books of Hermes Trismegistus. The late Dame FrancesYates, a world authority on the Renaissance, puts the scale of the discoveryinto context:From … early Christian writers, more about Hermes Trismegistus could be learned,particularly from Clement of Alexandria, who, in his striking description of theprocession of the Egyptian priests, says that the singer at the head of theprocession carried two books of music and hymns by Hermes; the horoscopuscarried four books by Hermes on the stars. In the course of this descriptionClement states that there are forty-two books by Hermes Trismegistus, thirty-sixof which contained the whole of the philosophy of the Egyptians, the other sixbeing on medicine. It is very improbable that Clement knew any of the Hermeticawhich have come down to us, but the Renaissance reader believed that he had inthe Corpus Hermeticum and the Asclepius precious survivors of that great sacredlibrary of which Clement speaks.20 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en666]Cosimo and his contemporaries believed that the ‘divine’ Plato had himself beentaught philosophy by the priests of Egypt. It was the desire to regain contactwith the source of that philosophy that mostly fired the imagination of Cosimode’Medici and led him to action.DROP PLATO, TRANSLATE HERMES INSTEADWhen the Hermetic texts reached Cosimo, it so happened that his adopted son,Marsilio Ficino, was busy translating the works of Plato from Greek into moreaccessible Latin. Cosimo ordered the young man to drop Plato at once and toconcentrate all his efforts full-time on the translation of the Hermetica.Ficino, then 27 years old, had already acquired a reputation as a fine scholar,theologian and linguist – especially in Greek and Latin. Born in 1433, he wasthe natural son of a Florentine physician, the latter a close friend of Cosimode’Medici. Cosimo adopted Ficino after the death of his father, and encouragedhim to pursue his passion for Plato's works.Roman Catholicism had a long history of disapproval of Platonic philosophy goingback before the closure of the original Academy in 529. By the 1400s, however,Plato was beginning to find supporters again within the Church – and Ficino wasone of these. He therefore set out very deliberately to apply his intellect toan integration of Plato's philosophy with Roman Catholic teachings. He wouldalso try to do the same, as we shall see, with the philosophy found in the booksof the ‘Egyptian sage’ Hermes Trismegistus. But what was amazing was that theman who was to be the head of Cosimo de’Medici's Platonic Academy should havebeen ordered to put aside Plato and to focus instead on the translation of thebooks of Hermes. As Frances Yates comments:It is an extraordinary situation. There are the complete works of Plato,waiting, and they must wait whilst Ficino quickly translates Hermes, probablybecause Cosimo wants to read him before he dies. What a testimony this is to themysterious reputation of [Hermes] the Thrice Great One! …21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en667]Within a year Ficino managed to complete a Latin translation of the 14 books or‘tracts’ of the Hermetica (as the collection that Leonardo da Pistoia hadbrought back from Macedonia is now known). In 1473, ten years after finishingthis work, Ficino was ordained a priest of the Roman Catholic Church andeventually became a high official at the Cathedral of Florence. It is widelyaccepted by scholars that his translations of the Greek classics and,especially, the works of Plato, were part of the impetus behind the ItalianRenaissance. But what is less appreciated is the huge, indeed revolutionary,effect that Ficino's translation of the Hermetica was also to have on Westernculture and on the Catholic Church itself.THE FULL CORPUSFicino had given his translation the title of Pimader, the name of themysterious ‘universal mind’ that supposedly had revealed to Hermes Trismegistusthe divine wisdom imparted in the Hermetica.Although the printing press had just been invented 15 years before,22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en668] the publication of Pimander was ahuge success. It had first circulated in handwritten copies but eventually wasprinted in 1471 in Treviso (apparently without permission from Ficino) under thetitle Pimander or the Power and Wisdom of God. This was somewhat misleadingsince the term Pimander, which is derived from the original Greek Poimadres –itself derived from Peime-n-Ré, meaning the ‘knowledge of Ré’, the Egyptiansun-god – only appears briefly in the opening part of the book. None of theother tracts in the Hermetica mention Pimander at all.Be that as it may the Treviso edition was so successful that it prompted anotherpublisher at Ferrera to bring out a rival edition in 1472, again withoutFicino's permission. By 1543, the same year that Copernicus's famous Derevolutionibus orbium coelestium (‘On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres’)was first published in Nuremberg, there were over 50 separate editions of theHermetica circulating in Europe!When Ficino had translated the texts back in 1463, he had not included a tractcalled the Logos Teleios, the Perfect Discourse, better known as the Asclepius.This was because the latter (a fragment of which, the reader will recall, wasalso found amongst the Nag Hammadi Gnostic texts) had already been translatedinto Latin from a Greek original sometime in late antiquity and had beencirculating among European scholars since medieval times. We shall come back tothe Asclepius in due course but, in brief for now, this book purports to explainthe magical religion of the Egyptians and, more importantly, the mysterioustalismanic skills that they supposedly deployed to draw down the powers of thestars into statues and other objects.23[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en669] It was this type of magic that wasto impress Ficino deeply and to influence his many followers.The Asclepius was printed for the first time in 1469 with the complete works ofApuleius, only two years before the first printed edition of Ficino's Pimander.It thus quickly became customary to attach the Asclepius to the Hermetica, thewhole forming one major corpus generally known as the ‘philosophical’ Hermeticaor Corpus Hermeticum. There is also a further booklet known as the Definitionsof Asclepius that is sometimes added to this corpus.According to French scholar Jean-Pierre Mahé, professor of humanities at theSorbonne in Paris, the Definitions of Asclepius was rediscovered in 1484, thatis two decades after the rediscovery of the Hermetica, in a far more dramaticand flamboyant manner than the Ruritanian spectacle of a monk riding his littledonkey into Florence. Apparently a certain Senore Ludovico Lazzarelli, in anobscure tract titled The Letter of Enoch, narrated how his master, Don GiovanniMercurio da Correggio, had helped him to find these lost writings of HermesTrismegistus (called also Mercurio by the Italians). On Palm Sunday in April ofthe year 1484, Giovanni Mercurio, then exactly 33 years old, that is thesupposed age of Christ at his Crucifixion, rode into Rome on a black stallionguided by two servants, and made his way towards the Vatican. Dressed in blackand wearing a golden belt and purple shoes, Giovanni Mercurio had placed on hishead a crown of thorns, and upon his brow was fixed a silver plaque in the formof a lunar crescent on which were written these words:This is my son Pimander, whom I personally chose. From early childhood he hasgrown to sublime heights, and I have empowered him with all my compliance tocast away demons and to install my truth and my justice upon all nations. Bewarned not to oppose him! Heed his words and obey him with fear and reverence.These are the words of the Lord of all the sanctuaries of the world, JesusChrist.24 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en670]Giovanni Mercurio then pulled a heap of leaflets out his saddlebag and threwthem all around. The crowds gathered; some thought him mad, others thought thathe was making some strange vow, but the majority hailed him as a prophet. At theVatican, the Swiss Guard baffled by this strange scene, stood aside and let himpass. In the cathedral Giovanni Mercurio announced that he was the reincarnatedPimander. He spent the next few days talking to the crowds then returned to hishometown in Bologna, where he was widely acclaimed by women and children. Notsurprisingly, he was soon arrested by the Inquisition for blasphemy andthreatened with the stake. In 1486, however, he was released under theprotection of the then king of France, Charles VIII.Almost every aspect of this whole strange episode underlines the incrediblereligious impact that the Hermetica had on the collective mind of theRenaissance and, even more curious, the way that Hermes/Mercurio Trismegistuswas being attached to the Christian faith.A repercussion of Giovanni Mercurio's strange but short career as a ‘prophet’ ofHermes Trismegistus, was that the poet and astrologer Lodovico Lazzarelli, whohad been an eyewitness to Giovanni's cavalcade into Rome on that Palm Sundayback in 1484, also succumbed to the Hermetic spell, and adopted the mysticalname of ‘Enoch’ (another alleged incarnation of Hermes).25[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en671] Lazzarelli became Giovanni's mostardent disciple and, according to him, here is how the Definitions of Asclepiuswere found:It was by chance, while scrutinising relentlessly the old books of those whoinspired me, and while over a cup full of the most suave nectar which, I do notdoubt, had flowed from the huge crater [bowl] of Hermes Trismegistus, by which Imean a small book in Greek having the title of the Definitions of Asclepius. Assoon as I read it, its conciseness and the mysterious authenticity of its wisdomenchanted me and filled me with admiration.26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en672]Lazzarelli made it his task to translate the Definitions of Asclepiusimmediately into Latin, but it was only after his death in 1507 that this bookwas eventually printed – alongside the work of the French Neoplatonist andoccultist Symphorien Champier, in his Book of the Quadruple Life. Now, at last,the full works attributed to Hermes Trismegistus were in the hands of Westernscholars, and something quite extraordinary was about to happen …VEILING HERMES IN THE CHURCH (1)In the mind of Marsilio Ficino, Hermes Trismegistus was a historical person whohad lived in ancient Egypt and had actually been the author of the Hermetica.This view was shared by all the Renaissance humanists and philosophers – notablythe great Christian Hermetic-Cabalist Giovanni Pico della Mirandola – who, likeFicino, were totally seduced by the Hermetica. As professor Jean-Pierre Mahéexplains:According to Marsilio Ficino, [Hermes] Trismegistus [Hermes Thrice-Great] hadmerited his surname by becoming at the same time the greatest of philosophers,the greatest of priests and the greatest of kings … And his successors wereOrpheus, Aglaophemus, Pythagoras and Philolaus, the teacher of Plato … Thus, theworks of Trismegistus were the true source of ancient wisdom. Not only thedivine Plato, but also the legendary Pythagoras and even the inspired poets suchas Orpheus, perpetuated the same Egyptian doctrine: all bouncing the echo, as itwere, of a single and same ancient theology, the prisca theologia … 27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en673]Concerned, however, not to undermine the authority of the Bible and awake theInquisition, the early Hermetic scholars accepted that Hermes Trismegistus cameafter Moses. This play-it-safe idea had originated with Saint Augustine, theManichean hearer who converted to Catholicism and became one of the greatdoctors of the Church (see Chapter Five). Augustine accepted that HermesTrismegistus lived long before the Greek philosophers, but insisted that he,… came after Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and even Moses. Because Moses wasborn in the time of Atlas, brother of Prometheus, who was a great astronomer …he was the grandfather of the older Mercury [Hermes], himself the grandfather of[Hermes] Trismegistus.28 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en674]But some did not agree with this chronology. Lazzarelli, who had translated theDefinitions of Asclepius and utterly believed in Hermes Trismegistus's olderorigin, argued:… It was not at the times of Moses that Trismegistus had lived, but long before,as one can easily ascertain from the works of Diodorus of Sicily. The latterreported, in his chronology of the kings of Egypt, it was first gods that ruledthen human brings. Hence it is evident that Mercury (Hermes) Trismegistus livedin the times of the gods … whereas Moses lived at an epoch where the Bible andmany other ancient writings known in Egypt clearly state when ruled pharaohs …29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en675]If you visit the famous Cathedral of Siena located between Rome and Florence,you will find that the entire floor, which dates back to 1488, is paved withexquisite marble designs depicting religious and mythological scenes. One ofthese scenes shows the Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus handing a book to anoriental figure standing in a respectful manner bowing slightly. Written uponthe book in Latin are the words ‘Suscipite O Licteras Et Lege Egiptii’, meaning‘Take up thy letters and laws O Egyptians’, and the bowing figure, according toFrances Yates, was ‘perhaps intended to be Moses.’30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en676] What seems to support this amazingidentification is the plaque under the feet of the figures which states: ‘HermesMercurius contemporaneous of Moses’, implying, says Yates:… a supplication from the lawgiver of the Hebrews (if the suppliant figure isMoses) to the lawgiver of the Egyptians to revive Egyptian piety and morality …The representation of Hermes Trismegistus in this Christian edifice, soprominently displayed near its entrance and giving him so lofty a spiritualposition, is not an isolated phenomenon but a symbol of how the ItalianRenaissance regarded him and a prophecy of what was to be his extraordinarycareer throughout Europe in the sixteenth century and well on into theseventeenth century …31 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en677]VEILING HERMES IN THE CHURCH (2)The ancient Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus, and by extension the writingsattributed to him, were indeed due for a glittering Renaissance career. In 1544,for example, when the French humanist Adrien Turnèbe (better known simply asTurnebus) published in Paris the first edition of the original Greek text of theHermetica accompanied by Ficino's translation in Latin, the theologian PetrusPaulus Vergerius had this to say in the preface:Hermes Trismegistus was an Egyptian by race … He flourished before the time ofpharaoh, as many of the chronographi think. Some, among whom is Cicero, supposethat he is the person whom the Egyptians call Thoth … He must have lived,therefore, before pharaoh, and consequently, before Moses also … He wrote at thetime many books of mystical philosophy and theology. Among these writings, thereare two of special importance: the one is called Asclepius, and the other,Poimandres [i.e. the Pimander].32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en678]After Turnebus's publication came the work of the bishop of Aire, François Foixde Candale, better known as ‘Flussas’, who published a new edition of theHermetica. Flussas was even more enthusiastic than his predecessors, anddedicated the work to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II, informing him thatHermes Trismegistus had attained to a knowledge of divine things which he firstwrote in Egyptian, then in Greek, surpassing that ‘which was revealed to theHebrew prophets, and equalling that of the Apostles and Evangelists’:What more is made known to us by those who were instructed by our Saviourhimself? And yet this man [Hermes] was anterior in time not only to thedisciples of our Lord, but also to all the prophets and teachers of our law,and, as the ancients say, to Moses himself.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en679]In 1591 came the Italian Neoplatonist scholar Francesco Patrizi da Cherso, alsoknown as Franciscus Patricius, who was also to publish an edition of theHermetica in his work Nova de universis philosophia (‘New Philosophy ofUniverses’). Patrizi not only saw Hermes Trismegistus as the source of allwisdom, but in the preface of his book, which is addressed to Pope Gregory XIV,Patrizi actually urged the pope to order that the Hermetica should be taught toeveryone, even to the Jesuits, because it could somehow serve as a ‘conversion’tool for the Catholic Church:I hope that you and your successors will adopt this new restored religiousphilosophy and cause it to be studied everywhere … I would have you then, HolyFather, and all future Popes, give orders that some of the books which I havenamed shall be continually taught everywhere, as I have taught them in the lastfourteen years at Ferrara. You will thus make all able men in Italy, Spain andFrance friendly to the Church; and perhaps even the German Protestants willfollow their example, and return to the Catholic faith. It is much easier to winthem back in this way than to compel them by ecclesiastical censures or bysecular arms. You should cause this doctrine to be taught in the schools of theJesuits, who are doing such good work. If you do this, great glory will awaityou among men of future times. And I beg you to accept me as a helper in thisundertaking.34 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en680]The ‘doctrine’ that Patrizi was referring to is the same that Plato had oncetaught and which, at least according to Patrizi, had been originally developedand transmitted to man in ancient Egypt by Hermes Trismegistus. Patrizi believedthat it was passed on to Plato during his stay in Egypt and then passed by Platohimself to his pupil Aristotle, the tutor of Alexander the Great.35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en681] Amazingly, Patrizi seems to beasking the pope to canonise the Hermetica and other related writings which, hebelieved, contained a pristine doctrine, a prisca theologia, rooted in ancientEgypt. Yet, seen in the context of his times, Patrizi's seemingly hereticalrequest to the pope is not as far-fetched as it at first appears. In fact therehad been one pope at least who took such ideas very seriously indeed …PICO DELLA MIRANDOLA, HERMETIC MAGIC AND THE CABALAOne of the most brilliant minds of the Renaissance belonged to a youngFlorentine scholar named Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. The scion of a noblefamily of Modena, Pico was much influenced by the ideas of Marsilio Ficino onHermeticism and, more especially, Hermetic magic which Pico not only completelyaccepted, by would propagate with even more fervour and enthusiasm.Whilst wholeheartedly sharing Ficino's view that Hermes Trismegistus was a‘gentile’ prophet of Christianity, Pico della Mirandola went further. What hesaw in the Hermetica was a form of mystical teaching and ‘natural magic’ whichhe also associated with the Jewish Cabala. The reader will recall from ChapterTwo that this was a system of mysticism rooted in esoteric Judaic traditions,that had received its most extensive elaboration and development amongst theJewish communities of coastal Occitania during the 12th century. Now, more than300 years later, Pico felt with all his heart that these two types of Cabalisticmagic, Jewish and ‘Egyptian’, needed to be merged and used for the benefit ofthe Christian Church.According to Frances Yates, ‘the marrying together of Hermeticism and Cabalism’was an invention of Pico della Mirandola, who also ‘united the Hermetic andCabalistic type of magic’ to create a powerful intellectual brew loosely termedthe Christian Hermetic-Cabala which was to have far-reaching consequencesamongst Renaissance theologians, reaching even as far as the Vatican itself.36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en682] And although magic, in themedieval sense, was abhorred and virtually outlawed by the Church, Picosuccessfully argued that what the Church had in mind concerned the diabolical‘modern’ type of magic which, he agreed was detestable. What he was advocating,he explained, was something quite other – the beautiful, ancient and innocentmagia naturalis, i.e. the ‘natural magic’ of the wise Egyptian sage HermesTrismegistus. This was seen by many, not just Pico, as a form of ‘sympatheticmagic’, which could establish a benevolent link between heaven and earth. Inshort, what Pico had in mind was that ‘Egyptian’ form of talismanic magic asfound in the Hermetica and, more especially, in the Asclepius.37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en683] But unlike Ficino, Pico believedthat this ‘Egyptian’ magic must be ‘supplemented’ by ‘practical Cabala’, i.e.Cabalistic magic. And precisely this, says Yates, is the intellectualcontribution to Renaissance magic that Pico was to develop with amazingsuccess.38 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en684]Cabala in fact, literally means ‘tradition’, namely that special Jewish mysticaltradition that was supposedly handed by God to Moses in the sacred Hebrewlanguage and which, according to Cabalists, conveys mystical and magical meaningencoded in the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Hebrew letters and the wordsthey form are viewed by Cabalists in very much in the same way as the statuesand objects of the Egyptians were most likely viewed by their devotees – that isto say as talismans charged with magical and mystical meaning that can bereleased through a form of ‘magic’. Thus, according to Pico, both theHermetic-Egyptian and Cabalistic-Hebrew magical systems – which supposedly hademanated, respectively, from the Egyptian lawgiver Hermes Trismegistus and theJewish lawgiver Moses – complement one another. The next step, surely, was tomerge them? And since both these ancient sages received their wisdom from Godand were thus ‘prophets’ of Christianity, then, in Pico's logic, the now mergedHermetic-Cabalistic magic rightfully belonged to the Christian Church!It is not within the scope of this book to review and elaborate on the complex‘science’ of Cabala, nor is it possible to enlarge and give details on how Picoproposed to merge this system with the Hermetic magic of the Asclepius or,indeed, incorporate it within the Catholic religion. Briefly, however, Picoessentially saw his Christian Hermetic-Cabala as the means through which the‘truth’ of the Trinity could be proved and confirmed to the people. Or as Picohimself was to put it, his Christian Hermetic-Cabala was the means of‘confirming the Christian religion from the foundations of Hebrew wisdom.’39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en685]It also did not take much imagination for the Church to see that Pico's clevervariant of the ancient Jewish mystical tradition could serve as a ‘conversiontool’ to bring Jews into the Catholic faith. One example of such a simple butdevastatingly effective ‘tool’ was Pico's very forceful argument that the nameof Jesus, Iesu in Hebrew, if interpreted through Cabalistic principles andmethodologies, could be proved to mean ‘God’, the ‘Son of God’, and also thespirit or ‘wisdom of God’, i.e. the Christian Trinity of Father, Son and HolySpirit.40 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en686] In short, Pico proposedto win the Jews over using their own mystical game. And indeed with suchseemingly simple but convincing manipulation of Hebrew words using ‘ChristianHermetic-Cabala’, it seems that many Jews living in Italy were persuaded that‘Christian truths’ were locked within their own religious scriptures and thusfelt compelled to convert to the Catholic faith.41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en687]Not surprisingly, Pico's bold but unwise claim ‘that there is no science thatgives us more assurance of Christ's divinity than magic and the Cabala’ wasbound to attract the somber attention of the papal Inquisition whose henchmenmissed the point of Pico's ‘good intention’ and promptly accused him ofheresy.42 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en688] Matters gotprogressively worse between Pico and the Church, and he had to take refuge inFrance and seek the protection of Charles VIII. He eventually returned to Italybearing letters from the king of France, and soon found himself under theprotection of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the powerful Medici ruler of Florencefrom 1469 – 92. In the tradition of his grandfather Cosimo, Lorenzo gave thefugitive political support and interceded on his behalf with the pope.43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en689] Pico spent his last years inFlorence where he died in 1494, at the youthful age of 31.Perhaps it should be mentioned that, coincidently, Pico had been born in thesame year that Marsilio Ficino had completed the first Latin translation of theHermetica. These propitious coincidences seem to have been part of Pico's life.The year before his death, Pope Innocent VIII, who had condemned Pico forheresy, was succeeded by the infamous Pope Alexander VI who, unlike hispredecessor, was rather open, indeed even sympathetic, towards magic, Cabala andHermeticism. In June 1493 Alexander VI gave his absolution to Pico dellaMirandola, revoked the charges against him, and even wrote him a personal letterin which he describes Pico as a ‘faithful son of the Church’ inspired by a‘divina largitas’ (‘divine bounty’).44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en690]Suddenly and, for a brief moment, there was a crack in the doors of the Vatican.Through it, quietly but surely like a thief in the night, the wisdom and magicof the ‘Egyptian sage’, Hermes Trismegistus, slipped quickly inside …THE BORGIAS, ORGIES IN THE VATICAN, ISIS AND OSIRIS ON THE CEILINGPope Alexander VI’s family name was Rodrigo Borgia. Born in the former Catharstronghold of Aragon in northeastern Spain, he came from an immensely wealthy,powerful and ultimately notorious family. His uncle the bishop of Valencia(later to become Pope Calixtus III), had supervised his education in Bologna inItaly and later made him a cardinal of the Roman Church. Through bribery andintrigue he thereafter succeeded in amassing a huge personal fortune. Father ofan unknown number of illegitimate children, he also had four legitimisedchildren from a Roman noblewoman, Vanozza de’Cattanei. These included thetwisted Cesare Borgia and the beautiful Lucrezia Borgia, whose names would cometo epitomise intrigue and foul play.In spite of his licentious reputation – and somewhat amazingly, all thingsconsidered – Rodrigo was elected pope in 1492 and adopted the name of AlexanderVI. He immediately began to manipulate and control the Vatican through briberyand by appointing members of his own family in key positions. Cesare Borgia, hiscelebrated evil son, was promoted to cardinal while still in his teens, alongwith another young man of the Borgia clan, Alessandro Farnese, the future PopePaul III. The latter was the brother of the pope's favourite mistress, GiuliaFarnese, known as ‘Giulia la bella’, (from whom the pope had at least oneillegitimate child). There are contemporary accounts of wild orgies at theVatican, and historians have even traced at least two assassinations bypoisoning directly related to Pope Alexander VI. Indeed, so corrupt and evil wasthe papacy of Alexander VI that after his death, even the Vatican itself couldnot avoid condemning him as the worst of the so-called bad popes – a politeunderstatement to describe the huge damage to the reputation of the CatholicChurch done by the Borgias.There is another, yet more bizarre story about Alexander VI which, we think,might explain his interest and even sympathy for Christian Hermetic-Cabala andthe ‘Egyptian’ magia naturalis of Hermes Trismegistus which Pico had sofervently expounded …A Dominican abbot called Giovanni Nanni – also known as Annius of Viterbo – wasa renowned historian who also acted as the personal secretary to Alexander VI.45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en691] In his better known workconcerning the chronology of man from the Flood to the fall of Troy, Nanniadvanced an extraordinary theory that the Borgia family of Pope Alexander VIwere descendants of the Egyptian god Osiris, also known in Nanni's days as the‘father of the Egyptian Hercules’.46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en692] Using such classical authoritiesas Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus and others – as well as the ‘authority’ ofcertain ancient texts which Nanni himself had forged – Nanni presented anastoundingly convincing theory that the ‘wisdom of the Egyptians’, that is theHermetic wisdom, had been transferred directly to the Italian people by Osiriswhen he had roamed the world in ancient times on a great civilising-mission.47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en693] According to the Danish scholar,Erik Iversen, Nanni then ‘provided a heroic genealogy for his papal patron bydemonstrating that the Borgia family descended directly from the EgyptianHercules, the son of Osiris, and that the bull on the family crest was, in fact,the Osirian Apis.’48 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en694]The pope must have taken such ideas very seriously indeed, for he promptlycommissioned the renowned Renaissance painter Pinturicchio to decorate theceiling of the Borgia apartments at the Vatican with scenes of HermesTrismegistus along with the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Osirian Apis bull –i.e. Serapis, the composite Graeco-Egyptian deity of ancient Alexandria. Onesuch scene is clearly an allegory of the Hermetic ‘natural’ or ‘astral’ magicfound in the Asclepius, where Hermes Trismegistus stands under a huge sky-globewith a large star dangling over his head, and is surrounded by variouswise-looking men or sages, probably representing the classical philosophers, whoare standing in reverence around him as if receiving his teachings.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en695]This strange episode of Nanni and the Borgia Pope is, of course, somewhatfarcical and has nothing or little to do with the erudite and scholarly approachthat Ficino, Pico della Mirandola and other savants applied to the Hermeticwritings. Nonetheless, it stands as evidence of how deep the Hermetic influencehad penetrated in those Renaissance days in Italy and the rest of Europe. Moreimportantly, it testifies to the strange lure that its mysteriousHermetic-Cabalistic talismanic ‘magic’ had on those seeking the divine secretsthrough the rediscovered ancient wisdom believed to be incorporated in thewritings of the ‘Egyptian’ Hermes Trismegistus.THE MYSTERY OF THE PICATRIX AND THE STAR-PEOPLEAlthough it can be said with absolute certainty that Ficino developed his ownbrand of talismanic and ‘natural magic’ from his readings of the Asclepius, somescholars, such as Frances Yates for example, also think that he was muchinfluenced by another Hermetic book on magic entitled Picatrix50[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en696] – a book that is not normallyassociated with the canon of the Corpus Hermeticum although versions of it hadbeen circulating in Europe since at least the 13th century. Indeed, a copy ofthe Picatrix was found in Pico della Mirandola's private library, and it is alsoalmost certain that Ficino and others of his group possessed copies or, at thevery least, knew where to find such copies.51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en697]The Picatrix was first translated into Latin from an Arabic version, now lost,which is believed to have been written in the 12th century in Spain, althoughsome scholars think that it might have been originally composed in Egypt in themid-11th century. In the Arabic version this book bore the title Ghayat AlHakim, which means the ‘The Aim of the Sage’ (also sometimes translated as ‘TheGoal of the Wise’) and no one really knows why Italian Renaissance scholarsnamed it Picatrix.52 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en698]With its source said to be 224 ancient manuscripts on Hermeticism, astrology,magic, Cabala and alchemy, the Picatrix is considered one of the most completeworks on ancient talismanic magic in existence. There are, today, variousEuropean translations available: in German by Helmut Ritter in 1933; in Spanishby Marcelino Villegas in 1982; in Latin by David Pingree in 1986; and in Italianby Davide Arecco and Stefano Zuffi, also in 1986. A partial English translationwas published in 2002 by Hashem Attallah, and we understand that, David Pingree,has been working on an English translation in recent years.53[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en699] Pingree published an extensivearticle on the Picatrix in the Journal of the Warburg Institute in 1981, andthere are some very useful commentaries on it, supported by extensivequotations, in Frances Yates's book Giordano Bruno and The Hermetic Traditionpublished in 1964, on which we have mostly based our investigation. Yates, whostudied the German and Latin versions of the Picatrix, concluded that this workmust be associated with the Hermetic tradition, since not only is much referenceto Hermes Trismegistus made in it but also it almost certainly draws from theideologies of the Sabaeans – Arabs of Harran (a location in the southeast ofmodern Turkey) who had adopted the Hermetica as their own ‘religion’ in theninth century AD and who also practiced the talismanic magic of the Asclepius.54[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en700]The Sabaeans’ venerated the moon-god Sin, and they are known to have been avidstargazers and astrologers. An interesting theory of how they got their name hasbeen put forward by Selim Hassan, an Egyptologist who worked at the Gizapyramids in Egypt in the 1930s.55 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en701]Hassan proposed that the name Sabaeans, which is Saba'ia in Arabic, may havecome from the ancient Egyptian word saba'a which means ‘star’. Apparently theSabaeans of Harran had performed yearly pilgrimages to the Giza pyramids fromtime immemorial until at least as late as the 11th century AD. At the pyramidsthey are known to have conducted astronomical observations and rituals which mayhave been remnants from the old astral religion of ancient Egypt. Hassanbelieved that the Sabaeans had recognised the Giza pyramids as monumentsdedicated to the stars, which probably inspired them to take the name Saba'iai.e. the ‘star-people’.56 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en702]There is, however, another possible explanation. When the Hermetic and Gnosticsects were persecuted in Egypt by the Roman Church, some initiates may have fledto Harran carrying with them copies of the Hermetic and Gnostic writings.Harran, with its moon-worship cult – note in Egypt that Thoth-Hermes was also amoon-god – and its star-worship and astral magic, would have been an obviousplace for the Hermetists and Gnostics seeking refuge and protection from theRoman and Christian persecutions. At any rate, whatever the true origins of theSabaeans, it seems clear that their astral and talismanic magic was passed on toArab scholars in Spain and Occitania, and that much of it survived in books suchas the Picatrix. It is not within the scope of this investigation to pass intoreview the whole content of the Picatrix, but suffice to say here that it servedas a sort of practical manual for talismanic magic or, to be more specific, itprovided a step-by-step explanation of how to make talismans by pulling intothem the power of the spiritual and astral world.Perhaps an example may be useful here. Imagine two identical AA batteries, thesort we use everyday to power electronic equipment such as CD players,penlights, cameras and the like. One of the batteries, however, is fully chargedwhile the other is empty. The charged battery has the potential to releaseenergy to power music, light and so forth; the other is simply an inert objectthat produces nothing. In a similar way any object can be charged withintellectual, spiritual or emotional energy, just like the battery can becharged with electrical energy. In short, a talisman can be created. Imagine ayoung man who takes his lover to a restaurant dinner by candlelight and, at theappropriate moment, after having made a full declaration of love, pulls out asmall box with a diamond ring in it and offers it as a token of his love.Whatever the reaction, that ring is henceforth not just a ring; it is atalisman.Today we use the words ‘sentimental value’, but an ancient Egyptian or Sabaeanor, if you prefer, a Hermetic thinker, would use the words ‘talismanic value’.We all have our talismans: rings, necklaces, bracelets, amulets, crystals and soforth. And we generally would be quite disturbed and unhinged should they getlost or stolen. Many cutting-edge researchers have long accepted that ancientEgyptian art, statuary, obelisks, pyramids and even whole cities were meant toact as powerful talismans. It is also recognised that the subliminal effect ofsuch talismans can be increased manifold by adding a variety of sensual stimuliother than mere visuals. Carefully chosen music, for example, will almostcertainly enhance the experience, as well as perfumes, incense and lightingconditions. We all know how vastly different it is to visit a cathedral with anoisy group of tourists and again alone when a choir is singing hymns in softcandlelight with the smoke of incense filling the air.It should be noted also that such talismanic environments do not necessarilyhave to be artificial. The natural environment can, and often does, act as a‘temple’. Just think of a Scotsman after years of absence returning to hisbeloved Highlands, or a Berber returning to the desert after a long spree in acity, and you will get the idea. This, in part, is what Ficino and Pico callednatural magic.But it is the perfect combination of an artificial ‘temple’ with a natural‘temple’ that can act as the most inspiring and effective ‘temple-talisman’ ofall. Think of the Palace of Versailles in France, the Taj Mahal in India, AngkorWat in Cambodia. Think of a city like Paris in the spring, or Rome in thesummer, or Washington, DC in the fall and you begin to understand the principlehere.All this may sound like some hocus-pocus pseudoscience in our present climate ofintense empirical, rational and analytical thinking. But irrespective of what wemay think of talismanic magic or so-called sacred science, the fact remains thatwe are complex creatures and we have evolved over billions of years under thesubtle influence of nature. Our senses act as finely tuned receivers that enableus to understand nature and the cosmos around us intuitively. Such abilities arequite simply, natural magic and in ancient times were skillfully amplified byenhancing and capturing the multiple aspects of nature within well-definedsymbols and talismans. We would go so far as to say that the ancient Egyptianpriests were the true masters of this arcane magic and that an Egyptian templewas not really a temple at all so much as a powerful talisman meant to influenceevents in the macrocosm. Enter an Egyptian temple and you enter a model of theuniverse as perceived by the inner human mind. A temple was not merely a placeof worship, but an environment that you had to integrate with – its ambiance,its harmonic proportions, its carefully chosen images, its symbols, it magicaltexts and its talismanic statuary, all of which were charged with archetypalvalues, cosmic principles and natural ideals. And yet in the Picatrix we arepresented with something far more ambitious than a sacred talismanic temple. Weare presented with no less than an esoteric manual for the transformation ofgreat cities, and even perhaps the whole world, into talismans …TEMPLE OF THE WORLDIn the Hermetic text known as the Asclepius there is a call sent to a futuregeneration of ‘wise men’ to bring about the full restoration and restitution ofthe true religion of the world57 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en703] –that is the magical talismanic religion which was once practiced in the sacredland of Egypt. This call is highly reminiscent of the mysterious ‘Organisation’spoken of in the Nag Hammadi Gnostic texts which date from approximately thesame period and which even include a fragment of the Asclepius. As the readerwill recall from Chapter Five the texts leave us with the impression that this‘Organisation’ was some sort of Gnostic secret society and that its objectivewas also the restoration of a ‘true religion’ – in its case, Gnosis.Let's look at the relevant passages of soaring prose in the Asclepius, in whichHermes Trismegistus laments and prophecies to his favourite pupil Asclepius theforthcoming and inevitable destruction of Egypt and its ancient and most reveredreligion:Do you not know, Asclepius, that Egypt is an image of heaven or, to be moreprecise, that everything governed and moved in heaven came down to Egypt and wastransferred there? If truth were told, our land is the temple of the wholeworld. And yet, since it befits the wise to know all things in advance, of thisyou must not remain ignorant: a time will come when it will appear that theEgyptians paid respect to divinity with faithful mind and painstaking reverence– to no purpose. All their holy worship will be disappointed and perish withouteffect, for divinity will return from earth to heaven, and Egypt will beabandoned. The land that was the seat of reverence will be widowed by the powersand left destitute of their presence. When foreigners occupy the land andterritory, not only reverence will fall into neglect but, even harder, aprohibition under penalty prescribed by law – so-called – will be enactedagainst reverence, fidelity and divine worship. Then this most holy land, seatof shrines and temples, will be filled completely with tombs and corpses. O Egypt, Egypt, of your reverent deeds only stories will survive, and they willbe incredible to your children! Only words cut in stone will survive to tellyour faithful works, and the Scythian or Indian or some such neighbour barbarianwill dwell in Egypt. For divinity goes back to heaven, and all the people willdie, deserted, as Egypt will be widowed and deserted by god and human. I call toyou, most holy river, and I tell your future: a torrent of blood will fill youto the banks, and you will burst over them; not only blood will pollute yourdivine waters, it will also make them break out everywhere, and the number ofthe entombed will be much greater than the living. Whoever survives will berecognised as Egyptian only by his language; in his actions he will seem aforeigner. Asclepius, why do you weep? Egypt herself will be persuaded to deeds muchwickeder than these, and she will be steeped in evils far worse. A land onceholy, most loving of divinity, by reason of her reverence the only land on earthwhere the gods settled, she who taught holiness and fidelity, will be an exampleof utter unbelief. In their weariness the people of that time will find theworld nothing to wonder at or worship. This all – a good thing that never hadnor has nor will have its better – will be endangered. People will find itoppressive and scorn it. They will not cherish this entire world, a work of Godbeyond compare, a glorious construction, a bounty composed of images inmultiform variety, a mechanism for God's will ungrudgingly supporting his work,a unity of everything that can be honoured, praised and finally loved by thosewho see it, a multiform taken as a single thing. They will prefer shadow tolight, and they will find death more expedient than life. No one will look up toheaven. The reverent will be thought mad, the irreverent wise; the lunatic willbe thought brave, and the scoundrel will be taken for a decent person. Soul andteachings about soul (that the soul began immortal or else expected to attainimmortality) as I revealed them to you will be considered not simply laughablebut even illusory. But – believe me – whoever dedicates himself to reverence ofmind will find himself facing a capital penalty. They will establish new laws,new justice. Nothing holy, nothing reverent nor worthy of heaven or heavenlybeings will be heard or believed in the mind. How mournful when the godswithdraw from mankind! Only the baleful angels remain to mingle with humans,seizing wretches and driving them to every outrageous crime – war, looting,trickery and all that is contrary to the soul …58[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en704]This superb piece of early Hermetic writing very much appears to anticipate theplight of the Egyptians under the Roman occupation of Egypt and, mostintriguingly, it also seems to foretell the collapse of the Egyptian religionthat was engineered after Christianity became the state religion of the RomanEmpire. Since the Asclepius is dated to no later than the third century AD and,more intriguing, since the decree of the very Christian Emperor Theodosiusoutlawing ‘paganism’ was not to be issued until AD 391, then the eeriepremonitions of the unknown author of this ominous tract are, to say the least,extraordinary. Yet this is not all. For the Lament goes on to promise hope forthe future in words that resonate like a temple bell:When all this comes to pass, Asclepius, then the master and father, the godwhose power is primary, governor of the first good, will look on this conduct …and in an act of will – which is god's benevolence – he will take his standagainst vices and the perversion in everything, righting wrong, washing awaymalice … then he will restore to the world to its beauty of old so that theworld itself will again seem deserving of worship and wonder, and with constantbenedictions and proclamations of praise the people of that time will honour thegod who makes and restores so great a work. And this will be the geniture of theworld: a reformation of all good things, and a restitution most holy and mostreverent of nature itself …59 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en705]Restoration, reformation and restitution to the ways and beauty of old … But a‘restoration, reformation and restitution’ by whom? How … and when?As the text continues it becomes clear that part of the plan – if it is a plan –includes the building or rebuilding of a magical talismanic city along certainwell-defined astronomical and symbolic principles:The gods who exercised their dominion over the earth will be restored one dayand installed in a city at the extreme limit of Egypt, a city which will befounded towards the setting sun, and into which will hasten, by land and sea,the whole race of mortal men …60 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en706]According to Frances Yates, the above passage presents us with the image of anenchanted utopia, a sort of ancient Egyptian version of Camelot, created by themanipulation of astral magic by adept priests who, as she says, were conversantin ‘astronomy, mathematics, music, metaphysics, and indeed practicallyeverything for the introduction of the spiritus [astral power] into talismans.’And all this was achieved, notes Yates by making ‘images of stars inscribed onthe correct materials, at the right times, in the right frame of mind and soon.’61 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en707] As for the magical cityitself, Yates thinks that it ‘might thus be seen both as the ideal Egyptiansociety before its fall and as the ideal pattern of its future and universalrestoration.’62 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en708]There is, too, another eerie passage in the Asclepius, where Hermes Trismegistusagain addresses his pupil and gives us a tantalising glimpse of how the ancientEgyptians saw their sacred land as a model or ‘image’ of the heavenly landscapeand a parallel world of the gods:Do you not know, Asclepius, that Egypt is an image of heaven? Or, to be moreprecise, that everything governed and moved in heaven came down to Egypt and wastransferred there? If truth were told, our land is the temple of the whole world…63 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en709]In a Hermetic tract known as the Kore Kosmou, the ‘Virgin of the World’ – i.e.Isis, the Egyptian goddess, the consort of Osiris – makes the followingrevelation to their son Horus:The earth lies in the middle of the universe, stretched on her back as a humanmight lie facing towards heaven … Her head lies toward the south … her rightshoulder toward the east, and her left shoulder towards the west; her feet liebeneath the Great Bear [north] … But the right holy land of our ancestors [i.e.Egypt] lies in the middle of the earth; and the middle of the human body is thesanctuary of the heart, and the heart is the headquarters of the soul; and that,my son, is the reason why men of this land … are more intelligent [wise]. Itcould not be otherwise, seeing they are born and bred upon Earth's heart.64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en710]In the above we have an actual geographical scheme which is based on some formof astral magic, where Egypt is said to be at the very centre of the world,right at the crossing of some prime meridian. It is interesting to note that theGreat Bear constellation is mentioned in this scheme, for it is well known thatancient Egyptian temples were ritualistically aligned to the Great Bearconstellation i.e. Ursa Major, in a ceremony known as the ‘stretching of thecord’. It can now be better understood why in the Asclepius the whole of Egyptis said to be a ‘temple’ or, more specifically, that Egypt is the ‘temple of theworld’. Was this what the ancients meant when they called Egypt the ‘land of thegods’? Was it, quite literally, a sacred land fashioned in the image of thecosmos?THE CITY OF ADOCENTYNPart IV of the Picatrix seems to elaborate on this theme. Here HermesTrismegistus is presented as the founder of a magical solar city that, we aretold, was designed around astrological ideas and that contained fantastictalismanic statues and other such wonders. The secret knowledge of this magicalcity of Hermes, claims the unknown author of Picatrix, was passed down the agesby the Chaldean Magi who were adepts in the science of talismanic magic:There are among the Chaldeans very perfect masters of this art and they affirmthat Hermes was the first who constructed images by means of which he knew howto regulate the Nile against the motion of the moon. This man also built atemple to the sun, and he knew how to hide himself from all so that no one couldsee him, although he was within it. It was he, too, who in the east of Egyptconstructed a city 12 miles long within which he constructed a castle which hadfour gates in each of its four parts. On the eastern gate he placed the form ofan eagle [Horus?]; on the western gate, the form of a bull [Apis?]; on thesouthern gate the form of a lion [Sphinx?], and on the northern gate heconstructed the form of a dog [Anubis?]. Into these images he introduced spiritswhich spoke with voices, nor could anyone enter the gates of the city withoutpermission. There he planted trees, in the midst of which was a great tree whichbore the fruits of all generation [immortality?]. On the summit of the castle hecaused to be raised a tower thirty cubits high on the top of which he ordered tobe placed a light-house, the colours of which changed every day until theseventh day after which it returned to the first colour, and so the city wasilluminated with these colours. Near the city there was abundance of waters inwhich dwelt many kinds of fish. Around the circumference of the city he placedengraved images and ordered them in such manner that by their virtue theinhabitants were made virtuous and withdrawn from all wickedness and harm. Thename of the city was Adocentyn …65 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en711]Dame Frances Yates’ commentary is most helpful:Passed through the vivid imagination of the Arabs of Harran, we seem to havehere something that reminds us of the hieratic religious magic described in theAsclepius. Here are the man-made gods, statues of the animal- and bird-shapedgods of Egypt, which Hermes Trismegistus has animated by introducing spiritsinto them so that they speak with voices and guard the gates of this magicalutopia. The colours of the planets flash from the central tower, and theseimages around the circumference of the City, are they perhaps images of thesigns of the zodiac and the decans [constellations] which Hermes has known howto arrange so that only good celestial influences are allowed into the City? Thelaw-giver of the Egyptians [Hermes] is giving laws which must perforce beobeyed, for he constrains the inhabitants of the City to be virtuous, and keepsthem healthy and wise, by his powerful manipulation of astral magic … One mightsay that this City shows us Hermes Mercurius [Trismegistus] in his triple roleof Egyptian priest and god-maker, of philosopher-magician, and of king andlawgiver … The pious admirer of those two ‘divine’ books by the most ancientHermes – the Pimander and the Asclepius – must surely have been struck by thisvivid description of a City in which, as in Plato's ideal Republic, the wise isthe ruler, and rules most forcibly by means of the priestly Egyptian magic suchas described in the Asclepius …66 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en712]In the original Arabic version of the Picatrix the name of the magical Hermeticcity is not given exactly as Adocentyn but as Al Ashmunain. This turns out to bea real location in Middle Egypt. It stands on the banks of the Nile where thereis an abundance of vegetation, fish and fauna, and would indeed have been aparadisiacal spot in antiquity. It was the main cult centre of Thoth/Hermes inGreek and Roman times67 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en713] and afamous temple dedicated to Thoth once stood here.68[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en714] For this reason the Greeks calledit Hermopolis i.e. the city of Hermes. Its original Egyptian name was Kmun,meaning ‘eight’, apparently in honour of a group of eight gods, the Ogdoad, whorepresented the world before creation.69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en715]We cannot be sure that it was Kmun/Hermopolis/Al Ashmunain that was envisaged bythe writers of the Picatrix when they summoned up their vision of the magical,talismanic city of Hermes Trismegistus. The problem is that Adocentyn, as theydescribed it, bears no resemblance to any real region in Egypt – althoughcertainly this was a land in which many ‘temples to the Sun’ existed, the mostfamous being Heliopolis in the north and Karnak-Luxor in the south. The termAshmunain in the original text of the Picatrix could also be a corruption of AinShams, meaning the ‘Eye of the Sun’, a name still used by Egyptians today todenote the region of Heliopolis.But what really interests us about the talismanic city of the Picatrix is not somuch its very plausible connection to real sacred cities of ancient Egypt. Farmore important, in our view, has been its role as an archetype or template forcities to be built or rebuilt in the future, including the capitals of Britain,Italy, France and the United States. We will demonstrate in later chapters thatin each of these cases prominent monuments, works of architecture, and sometimesthe street plans of whole districts, appear have been harnessed to a secretHermetic scheme.If we are right then we have come across the traces of an organisation that hashitherto sustained its existence and purpose undetected for hundreds of yearswhile carrying out immense projects of occult urban planning – all of them‘hidden’ in full public view. To understand why anyone might have been motivatedto do such an audacious thing we must first explore the Hermetic religion thatlies behind the cosmic city of Adocentyn."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETWO PHOENIXESA divine city hath been built for me, I know it and I know the name thereof…Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en716] I have come into the city of god – the region which existed in primeval time.Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en717] The opening into the city is fire … and the god hath made it for those whofollow willingly in his train … He hath made the city so that he may dwelltherein at will, and none can enter therein except on the day of the greattransformations …Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en718] Specialised scholars who study ancient literature often argue that there is nostrong genetic link between the known religious texts of ancient Egypt (whichspan the period from roughly 2300 BC to 0 BC) and the Hermetic texts composed inAlexandria in Egypt between approximately AD 1 and AD 300. ‘There is a want oftechnical Egyptian mythological, liturgical and sacerdotal knowledge in the[Hermetic] texts,’ explains Tobias Churton:We really learn nothing about Egyptian religion, except in the most generalterms, terms which would not stretch the vocabulary gained by the average readerof a tourist guide to ancient Egypt today.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en719]The scholarly dissection of the Hermetica began with Isaac Casaubon (1559 –1614) who late in his life argued, successfully, that none of the texts couldpossibly have been written by an ancient Egyptian named Hermes Trismegistus – ashad been widely believed since their rediscovery in 1460. By skilful textualanalysis he rightly attributed them to the early Christian period in the firstthree centuries AD and thus, it seemed, ‘debunked’ the notion that they were asold or older than Moses. Casaubon's findings took many years to be fullyaccepted, but wherever they were accepted they removed from the texts the auraof prestige that their false antiquity had given them. The inevitable result,over the next century and a half, was that:… the Hermetic writings lost their hold on men's interest, and sank intocomparative neglect.5 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en720]A renewal of academic interest in the Hermetica was brought about almostsingle-handedly in the 1960s by Dame Frances Yates, whose works we citefrequently in this book. By ‘making Hermes a major figure in the preliminariesto the scientific revolution’ and a vital catalyst of the Renaissance she hasensured that the Hermetic writings are now once again ‘required reading for manystudents of early modern thought and letters.’6[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en721]In Yates’ view Casaubon's debunking exercise in the 17th century had thrown outthe baby with the bathwater. To be sure, the texts were not ancient Egyptian inorigin – Casaubon was right about that. Nevertheless the ‘Egyptian illusion’,which misled the scholars of the Medici Academy and their successors all overEurope for the best part of two centuries, gave the Hermetic texts the power andleverage – and enough time – to effect profound changes in the way that peoplethought about the world and understood the human predicament.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en722]PRESERVING THE ESSENCEThis argument for pragmatic study of the effects of the Hermetic writings,regardless of any debate about their antiquity, has made the subjectacademically respectable again but has done nothing to advance our understandingof their origins. We are left to believe that these astoundingly sophisticatedtexts arose fully-formed out of nowhere in the first three centuries AD, with nobackground or evolution, and are asked to accept that:The precise provenance of the philosophical Hermetica remains to a large extenta mystery.8 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en723]The one certainty, all the experts agree, is that there must have been a closeconnection between the philosophers and religious thinkers who composed theHermetica in Alexandria in the first three centuries AD and the philosophers andreligious thinkers who composed the Gnostic texts in Alexandria in exactly thesame period. It is not simply that certain texts of the Hermetica (including theAsclepius) were part of the Nag Hammadi Gnostic library9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en724] – although this is stronglyindicative of overlapping interests in the Hermetic and Gnostic communities ofthat period. Much more significant are the deep structural connections at thelevel of ideas that can be demonstrated between the two collections of texts.The painstaking work that has revealed these connections, and begun to get togrips with the amazing philosophical and religious undercurrents of lateantiquity, has all been done by orthodox, ‘mainstream’ scholars. Since Casaubon,however, (with a few remarkable exceptions who we'll meet in later chapters) ithas been tantamount to academic suicide to reinvestigate the supposedly settledquestion of any possible ancient Egyptian origin for the Hermetic texts.Our primary objective in this book is to follow the traces of what we suspectmay be a ‘conspiracy’, or something very like one, based on Hermetic and Gnosticideas and originally formulated about 2,000 years ago. In complete contradictionto the scholarly consensus it is our proposal that the Hermetic texts areclosely connected to the much older ancient Egyptian religion. They may havebeen deliberately designed to preserve its essence while dispensing with itssubstance. To take a metaphor from Gnostic and Hermetic teachings ofreincarnation, the intention may have been to transfer the soul of the Egyptiansystem, at the point of its death under the Roman Empire, into an entirely newand different ‘body’ better adapted to the times.BUILDING THE CITY OF THE GODThere is a consistent emphasis on cities throughout the Hermetic literature.At the end of Chapter Eight we drew particular attention to the magical ‘cosmiccity’ of Adocentyn, said in the Picatrix to have been built in the remote pastby Hermes Trismegistus and so designed that it brought benevolent celestialinfluences streaming down on its inhabitants. We also pointed out that a similarmagical city built by the gods is described in the Asclepius, probably thebest-known of all the Hermetic texts. There it is intriguingly portrayed not asa city of the past but as a prophesied city – a city of the future:… which will be founded towards the setting sun, and into which will hasten, byland and sea, the whole race of mortal men …10[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en725]If there is no genetic connection between the ancient Egyptian and the Hermetictexts, as scholars tell us, then it is presumably a coincidence that Chapter 183of the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead dated to about 1200 BC, contains thiscurious passage:I come from the city of the god, the primeval region; soul, ka and spirit arewhat is in this land. Such is its god, namely the Lord of Truth possessor ofprovisions, he to whom every land is drawn …11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en726]Soul, ka and spirit are the names given to different elements of the person allbelieved by the ancient Egyptians to survive death, while ‘Lord of Truth’ is afrequently used epithet for the wisdom god Thoth-Hermes. So here in the Book ofthe Dead we have a ‘city of the god’ (indeed a city of the god who would becomeHermes) towards which ‘every land is drawn’. Isn't that essentially the sameconcept that crops up more than 1400 years later in the supposedly unconnectedAsclepius (circa AD 268 – 273) where ‘the whole race of mortal men’ hastentowards a city built by the gods?Going further back in time we come to the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, theworld's oldest scriptures, dated to around 2300 BC. Here too we find referencesto the sacred functions of cities that are echoed in the much later andsupposedly unconnected Hermetica. Of particular interest is Utterance 319 inwhich we learn that it is the responsibility of the king, during his reign, tobuild the city of the god:The King has united the heavens, the King has power over the southern andnorthern lands, and the gods who were aforetime, the King has built the city ofthe god in accordance with its proper due.12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en727]This idea that it is the sacred duty of the king to build a city that willharmoniously unite earth and heaven for the benefit of its inhabitants would betaken up some 4,000 years later by the great Hermetic philosopher TommasoCampanella. Based entirely on his studies of the Hermetica, Campanella claimedin the early 17th century that he could ‘make a city in such a wonderful waythat only by looking at it all the sciences may be learned.’13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en728] He would go on, as we will see inChapter Twelve, to prophesy that King Louis XIV of France would be the one whowould actually build this magical ‘City of the Sun.’We recall the words of Frances Yates, reported in Chapter Eight, to the effectthat Adocentyn, the magical city of the Picatrix, kept its citizens healthy andwise through the ‘powerful manipulation of astral magic’ which ensured that only‘good celestial influences’ could reach them. How different is this fromCampanella's claim to be able to make a city from which its inhabitants couldlearn and benefit merely by looking at it? Or from this passage in the ancientEgyptian Pyramid Texts where the king says:I build you, O city of mine; You shall do for me every good thing which Idesire; You shall act on my behalf wherever I go …14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en729]SKY AND GROUNDWe suggest that key shared concepts underlie this shared interest in the cosmic‘City of the God’ and/or ‘City of the Sun’ that is found in both the ancientEgyptian and the Hermetic texts. The most important of these concepts is,indeed, the unifying theme of the entire corpus of Hermetic writings:That which is below corresponds with that which is above, and that which isabove corresponds with that which is below, in the accomplishment of the miracleof the one thing …15 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en730]The passage quoted is from The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, not partof the so-called philosophical Hermetica but one of a large number of alchemicalHermetic tracts from various periods that fall largely outside the scope of thisdiscussion. Nonetheless in both the alchemical and the philosophical Hermetica,as throughout the much older ancient Egyptian texts, we encounter the consistentdeployment of a distinctive metaphor in which ‘sky’, ‘heaven’, ‘above’ and otherrelated terms represent the spiritual, immaterial realms to which the soulproperly aspires, while ‘ground’, ‘earth’ and ‘below’ represent the world ofgross matter in which the soul is imprisoned. Implicit – and often explicit – inthe relevant texts is the understanding that perfection belongs exclusively tothe ‘above’ world, while the world of ‘earth’ and ‘below’ is corrupt andeternally imperfect.Let's look first at a few examples from the ancient Egyptian texts, all of whichin different ways explore, describe and prepare the initiate for life afterdeath as it was conceived in the religion of the pharaohs:Your soul is bound for the sky, your corpse is beneath the ground … You shall goup to the sky … You shall ascend to those who are above the earth …16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en731] (Book of the Dead) You shall ascend to the sky, you shall traverse the firmament, you shallassociate with the stars …17 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en732] (Bookof the Dead) This King is Osiris in a dust-devil; earth is this King's detestation … ThisKing is bound for the sky …18 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en733](Pyramid Texts) Arise, remove your earth, shake off your dust, raise yourself, that you maytravel in company with the spirits, for your wings are those of a falcon, yourgleam is that of a star…19 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en734](Pyramid Texts) ‘How lovely to see you, how pleasing to behold!’ says Isis, ‘when you ascend tothe sky, your power about you, your terror about you, your magic at your feet …The doors of the sky are opened for you, the doors of the starry firmament arethrown open for you …’20 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en735] (PyramidTexts)A particularly clear example of what we might call ancient Egyptian‘matter-spirit dualism,’ is found in the Coffin Texts, circa 1900 BC:The King is pure on that great tomb-plateau; the King has got rid of his evil;the King has discarded his wrongdoing; the King has cast down to earth the evilswhich were on his flesh …21 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en736]This passage contains the by now familiar equivalences (matter = evil; spirit =good) that we've encountered repeatedly in Part I of this book amongst theGnostics of the early Christian era and their dualist successors the Bogomilsand the Cathars. Yet it was composed 2,000 years before any of the survivingGnostic texts and 3,000 years before the upsurge of the Cathar phenomenon inWestern Europe in the 12th century AD.In our view it is not a coincidence that the Hermetic texts are redolent ofexactly the same system of ideas. A few extracts are sufficient to make thepoint:Evil, as I have told you before, must needs dwell here on earth, where it is athome; for the home of evil is the earth.22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en737] (Hermetica, Libellus IX) It came to pass that evils inherent in matter were intermingled with the humanbody.23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en738] (Hermetica, Asclepius III) The soul of a child … is still hardly detached from the soul of the Kosmos. Butwhen the body has increased in bulk, and has drawn the soul down into itsmaterial mass, it generates oblivion; and so the soul separates itself from theBeautiful and Good, and no longer partakes of that; and through this oblivionthe soul becomes evil.24 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en739](Hermetica, Libellus X) I see that by god's mercy there has come to be in me a form which is notfashioned out of matter, and I have passed forth out of myself and entered intoan immortal bod y.25 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en740] (Hermetica,Libellus XIII) You are purified, now that you have put away the earthly tabernacle.26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en741] (Hermetica, Libellus XIII)The last quoted remark, although from the Hermetica, could equally well sum upthe state of the Cathar perfectus in receipt of the consolamentum – whothereafter severed all connections with the world of matter. Meanwhile in thePyramid Texts of the ancient Egyptians the formula ‘remove your earth, shake offyour dust’27 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en742] was used in exactlythe same way and to exactly the same purpose.THE DIVIDED CREATUREScholars do not dispute the existence of a strong genetic link between Gnosticand Hermetic beliefs. On the contrary such a link is fully accepted. As we'veseen, however, the notion of a similarly close link between the Hermeticreligion and the ancient Egyptian religion is outright rejected. It'sprovocative then that all three systems appear to be in complete agreement intheir analysis of the fundamental dilemma of the human being as an ambiguous or‘dual’ creature composed both of matter and of spirit.The doctrine of the Gnostics, Bogomils and Cathars on this subject has beenexplored extensively in Part I. The reader will recall the vivid picture paintedin their teachings and myths of the souls of fallen angels trapped in the‘alien’ material world within the gross physical bodies of men and women. Theview that emerges of the human condition is undeniably that of a creature madeof ‘mud’ and corruption that is paradoxically illuminated by a divine anddeathless spark – a creature in large part of ‘earth’ that also contains afragment of ‘heaven’.Could this permanent state of duality be what the composers of the ancientEgyptian Book of the Dead were hinting at with an enigmatic formula found inChapter 156 that reads ‘His one arm is toward the sky, his other arm is towardthe earth’?28 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en743] It is certainly whatthe Hermetic sages had in mind in the Pimander when they wrote:Man, unlike all other living creatures upon earth, is twofold. He is mortal byreason of his body; he is immortal by reason of the man of eternal substance …He is exalted above the structure of the heavens … yet he is mastered by carnaldesire and by oblivion.29 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en744]In the Hermetic text that bears his name, the student Asclepius asks Hermes theobvious question about this arrangement:But what need was there, Trismegistus, that man should be placed in the materialworld? Why might he not have dwelt in the region where God is, and there enjoyedperfect happiness?30 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en745]In reply Hermes explains that God first created man as an ‘incorporeal andeternal being’ – the reference here is to the spiritual man, the immortal soul,the ‘divine spark’. Then, however:Perceiving that the man whom he had made could not tend all things on earthunless he enclosed him in a material envelope, God gave him the shelter of abody to dwell in, and ordained that all men should be formed in like manner.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en746]While we recognise that the Hermetic script at this point diverges sharply fromthe Gnostic/Cathar script (in which the soul of man is made by the God of Goodand the body of man is made by the God of Evil) the general scenario ofincorporeal souls immersed in matter nevertheless remains almost identical inthe two religions. One profound difference must however be acknowledgedconcerning their attitudes towards matter – for while the Gnostics and Catharsdeduced from their beliefs that matter should be hated, the Hermeticists reacheda much more positive conclusion about the creation and about man's place in thescheme of things:Thus he [God] fashioned man of the substance of the mind, and the substance ofbody – of that which is eternal and that which is mortal – blending and minglingtogether portions of either substance in adequate measure, to the end that thecreature so fashioned might be able to fulfil the demands of both sources of hisbeing, that is to say, to venerate and worship the things of heaven, and at thesame time to tend and administer the things of earth.32[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en747]KNOWLEDGE, REASON, INTELLIGENCE …Later in the same Hermetic text – the Asclepius – the argument verges back intoclose proximity to Gnostic ideas when it reminds us that it is the ultimatedestiny of the human soul to end its sojourn on earth and return to the heavenswhere it belongs:God saw that of all living creatures men alone had need of reason and knowledge,whereby they might repel and put away from them the evil passions inherent intheir bodies; and for this cause he imparted to them the gift of reason; and atthe same time … he held out to them the hope of immortality, and gave them powerto strive toward it.33 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en748]In the case of the Gnostic religion the reader will recall from Part I that thereturn to the heavenly realm could not be achieved by blind faith but was to bestriven for through gnosis – ‘revealed knowledge of the reality of things’. Inthe case of the Hermetic religion we see this same emphasis on knowledge, nowalso combined with the ‘gift of reason’. Indeed the Asclepius goes so far as tostate that the ‘divine part’ of man consists of ‘mind, intellect, spirit, andreason,’ and to assert that it is on account of these ‘higher elements’ that heis ‘found capable of rising to heaven’.34[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en749]This goal of the return to heaven, the Pimander asserts explicitly, is the‘consummation for those who have got gnosis.’35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en750] And in one of the Discourses ofHermes a helpful definition is even offered of the precise kind of knowledgeinvolved in gnosis. It seems that it ‘cannot be taught by speech, nor learnt byhearing’:Knowledge differs greatly from sense-perception … Knowledge is incorporeal; theorgan which it uses is the mind itself; and the mind is contrary to the body.36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en751]The individual's quest for gnosis, in both its Hermetic and purely Gnosticforms, involved putting off the material world and its illusions. The readerwill recall from Part I the asceticism of the Gnostic sages of Alexandria and oftheir successors the Cathar and Bogomil perfecti. The writers of the Hermetictexts would have approved: ‘If a man understands the design of god,’ says theAsclepius, ‘he will despise all material things.’37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en752]On the other hand, for those who persist in willful ignorance, all the vices andevils that are inherent in the material realm:… grow in strength, and lacerate the soul with incurable sores; and infected andcorrupted by the poison, the soul breaks out in tumours, so to speak, save inthe case of those whose souls are cured by the sovereign remedy of knowledge andintelligence.38 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en753]Like so much else in the Hermetica, this constant emphasis on the role ofknowledge and intelligence in the soul's struggle to win immortality seems tohave strong precursors in the ancient Egyptian funerary texts. There weencounter a bearded god called Sia who attends Ra in the solar barque. Sia'sspecial quality is that he is the personification of intelligence39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en754] so it is interesting that his rolein bringing the soul of the deceased safely through the Netherworld isrepeatedly emphasised. In Spell 237 of the Coffin Texts, for example, thedeceased embarks on his afterlife journey with confidence stating: ‘I know whatSia knows, and a path is opened for me …’40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en755] Earlier in Spell 38 we read: ‘Ihave seen the chest [i.e strongbox] of Sia and I know what is in it …’41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en756] Another metaphor for the crucialimportance of intelligence is employed in Spell 689 which states: ‘This King hasswallowed Sia, he has eaten magic from the magician.’42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en757] In the Book of What is in the Duatwe find Sia accompanying the deceased on his journey through the Netherworld andopening gates of fire that would otherwise remain closed to him.43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en758]STARS AND ANGELS FALLING TO EARTHIn the ancient Egyptian system the afterlife journey through the Netherworld –the Duat – was the opportunity for the ‘perfected spirit’ (i.e. one that hadacquired the necessary knowledge during incarnation on earth) to throw offforever the entrapments of matter, ascend to the spiritual realms and become,metaphorically, a star in heaven. In the case of initiates in the Gnosticsystem, whether in its early Christian or later Cathar forms, we know that thissought-after ‘ascent to heaven’ was in fact understood as a re-ascent of ourangelic souls to the heavenly realms from which they had fallen long ago.The reader will recall from Chapter Three vivid descriptions of angels falling‘like rain upon the earth’ through a hole in heaven, having been tempteddownwards by Satan who then trapped them in human bodies and the cycle ofreincarnation. There are some striking but neglected passages in the ancientEgyptian texts which seem to us to be expressions of essentially the same ideaand once again provide support for a mysterious connection between the religionof ancient Egypt and the Hermetic and Gnostic religions. For example in Chapter99 of the Book of the Dead we read:This land is baleful and the stars have overbalanced themselves and have fallenon their faces therein, and they have not found anything which will help them toascend again …44 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en759]Routine use is made in the ancient Egyptian texts of the star as a metaphor forthe beatified and ‘perfected’ soul. We therefore see little difference in intentbetween this image of fallen stars unable to get back to the sky and the Gnosticimage of fallen angels unable to return to heaven. Of course the purest and mostspiritual angels in the Gnostic/Cathar system were those who resisted temptationand never fell to earth at all. So it was too amongst the ancient Egyptians asfar back as the Pyramid Texts in 2300 BC:The King is one of those … beings … who will never fall to the earth from thesky …45 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en760]REPRODUCING ETERNITY IN A COPYAt the heart of all such imagery, whether ancient Egyptian, Gnostic or Hermetic,is the sense of a radical rupture between matter and spirit, sky and earth.We've seen how all three of these religions taught the need for some sort ofspecial knowledge – gnosis – as a way of escape for souls trapped ‘below’. Inthe case of the Cathars the saving knowledge was acquired through asceticism,study, and the initiation ritual known as the consolamentum. In the case of theHermeticists and the ancient Egyptians, as we saw earlier and in Chapter Eight,there was a curious interest in cities which were to be made, so far aspossible, in ‘the image of heaven’. By somehow replicating or ‘copying’celestial perfection on earth, the clear implication of the Hermetic texts isthat such cities would provide untold benefits to their inhabitants, constrainthem ‘to be virtuous’ and keep them ‘healthy and wise’.46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en761]In the Pimander, the first book of the Hermetic collection, we even find thisidea of replication of the above by the below employed in describing the processof creation. We are led to understand that there exists an ‘archetypal form’,perceptible only to the mind and not at all to the senses, ‘which is prior tothe beginning of things and is limitless.’ The material world:… issued from God's Purpose, which beheld that beauteous world [i.e. thearchetypal form] and copied it.47 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en762]The Asclepius likewise speaks of a ‘higher’ archetypal Kosmos that isimperceptible to the senses but that nevertheless influences and shapes thelower ‘sensible’ Kosmos that we inhabit as beings of matter:If you consider the whole, you will learn that in truth the sensible Kosmositself, with all things that are therein, is woven like a garment by that higherKosmos.48 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en763]A little later the same text adds:God … stands unmoved; and eternity likewise is ever changeless, containing initself a Kosmos which is without beginning, even that Kosmos which we rightlycall ‘imperceptible to sense’. This sensible Kosmos [i.e. the universe of matterand space that we see all around us] has been made in the image of that otherKosmos, and reproduces eternity in a copy.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en764]In the Discourses of Hermes to Tat we learn more about the mechanisms of the‘copying’ process:The forces do not work upward from below, but downward from above. The things inheaven receive no benefits from the things on earth; but the things on earthreceive all benefits from the things in heaven.50[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en765]In the beautiful and mysterious Kore Kosmou the point is re-emphasised with moredetail:All the world which lies below has been set in order and filled with contents bythe things which are placed above; for the things below have not the power toset in order the world above. The weaker mysteries, then, must yield to thestronger; and the system of things on high is stronger than the things below.51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en766]HERMETIC LANDSCAPESWe are now better equipped to understand the central Hermetic notion, introducedin Chapter Eight, of ancient Egypt as an ‘image of heaven’:Do you not know, Asclepius, that Egypt is an image of heaven? Or, to be moreprecise, that everything governed and moved in heaven came down to Egypt and wastransferred there? If truth were told, our land is the temple of the whole world…52 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en767]If the land of Egypt is ‘an image of heaven’, and for that reason ‘the temple ofthe whole world’, then it's easy to understand how those who believed this mighthave wanted to build temples that were also – in their own smaller-scale way –‘images of heaven’. The same logic would also apply to the creation andpositioning of great monuments. And of course to the planning and building – orrebuilding – of cities. In other words if we know that a person is a committedinitiate of the Hermetic system then we can predict that he or she will take aninterest in temples, monuments and cities that in some way ‘imitate’ or ‘copy’heaven. If it so happens that the initiate is a great king or a person otherwisein a position to have a major influence on decisions about the builtenvironment, we might expect to see that interest turned to action.It is understood that the earthly ‘copy’ is and always will be inferior to theheavenly archetype on which it is modelled because ‘there is nothing good onearth; there is nothing bad in heaven,’ and because while ‘nothing in heaven isin bondage, nothing on earth is free.’53[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en768] Nevertheless, the clear logic ofthe Hermetic texts is that it is better to copy the perfection of heaven onearth – however inferior the results – than to do nothing at all. In theDiscourses of Hermes to Tat we read:All things on earth … are unreal; but some of them – not all, but some few only– are copies of reality … When the appearance flows in from above, it becomes animitation of reality. But apart from the working of power from above, it remainsan illusion; just as a painted portrait presents to us in appearance the body ofthe man we see in it, but is not in itself a human body.54[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en769]It seems perfectly obvious from this that a Hermetic king would prefer todispose his monuments, temples and cities so that ‘power from above’ would beable to work in them. And the way to do that, as the texts themselves suggest,would be to fashion the built environment as an ‘imitation of reality’, ‘animage of heaven’, ‘a reproduction of eternity in a copy’…THE BEAUTY OF THE ARCHETYPEPracticed in Europe between the 10th and the 14th centuries, the Gnosticreligion of the Bogomils and the Cathars taught an intense ‘matter-spiritdualism’. As we would expect in such closely interconnected systems, it alsomade use of ‘sky-ground’ metaphors of the specifically Hermetic and ancientEgyptian type. In Chapter Three we cite several examples of such Bogomil andCathar teachings, including the notion that a number of their sacred books hadbeen ‘written in heaven and brought down to earth’ and the following classically‘Hermetic’ doctrine:For just as it is on earth, so also it is in the firmament, because replicas ofwhat are in the firmament are on earth.55[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en770]Once again we find striking precedents in the supposedly unrelated funerarytexts of ancient Egypt. There are, for example, numerous exhortations callingupon initiates to make copies on the earth of a region of the sky called theDuat incorporating the constellation of Orion – associated with the god Osiris –and the star Sirius, associated with the goddess Isis.56[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en771] This was the sky-region believedto be the location of the ancient Egyptian Netherworld, where souls journeyedand were judged after death. It was therefore thought to be vitally important togain foreknowledge of it and of the trials that awaited the soul there. We learnfrom the Book of What is in the Duat (circa 1400 BC), that one way to attainthis gnosis was to build copies on the ground‘of the hidden circle of the Duatin the body of Nut [the sky]’57 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en772]:Whosoever shall make an exact copy of these forms, and shall know it, shall be aspirit well-equipped both in heaven and in earth, unfailingly, and regularly andeternally.58 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en773] Whosoever shall make a copy thereof, and shall know it upon earth, it shall actas a magical protector for him both in heaven and in earth, unfailingly andregularly and eternally.59 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en774]For a supposedly unrelated text, it is odd that the Book of What is in the Duatseems to draw the same distinction as the Hermetica between the heavenlyarchetype, that is perceptible only to the mind, and the earthly copy that isperceptible to the senses. Both traditions therefore necessarily imply a groupof initiates who were trained to ‘see’ – i.e. attain gnosis of – what otherwiseonly the gods could see:The secret representation of the Duat is not known to men and women.60[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en775] Whosoever shall make a copy of these representations according to this copy ofwhat is in the Lament of the Duat, which cannot be looked at or seen, andwhosoever shall know these secret images, shall be in the condition of a spiritwho is equipped for journeying …61 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en776][Emphasis added]To become ‘a spirit equipped for journeying’ was, of course, the goal of theentire ancient Egyptian religious system in the sense that it sought to equipits initiates for spiritual immortality and freedom from the fetters of matter.But it was possible to fail in this quest and for the soul to be destroyedutterly. Consistent and repeated evil acts were inevitably fatal to the soul ofthe perpetrator. Willful ignorance – always detested by the Hermetic sages – wasalso believed to be extremely dangerous to one's prospects of eternity. Thus:He who hath no knowledge of the whole or part of the secret representations ofthe Duat, shall be condemned to destruction.62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en777]We reiterate that the Duat, for the ancient Egyptians, was understood to be aregion of the starry sky and that those who aspired to immortality rather thanextinction in the afterlife were more or less obliged to attain knowledge of it.Is it a coincidence that an almost identical scenario is painted in the Hermetictexts where, after a lengthy exposition on the sky and stars, we are abruptlytold:He who has not failed to get knowledge of these things is able to form an exactconception of god … But it is impossible, my son, for one who is yet in the bodyto attain to this happiness. A man must train his soul in this life, in orderthat, when it has entered the other world, where it is permitted to see God, itmay not miss the way which leads to him. But men who love the body will neversee the vision of the Beautiful and Good. How glorious, my son, is the beauty ofthat which has neither shape nor colour.63[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en778]In other words the beauty of the archetype, which ‘cannot be looked at or seen’by uninitiated men and women because it is perceptible only to the mind and notat all to the senses.TRANSFORMING THE WORLDThe recurrent emphasis on intelligence, reason and the use of the mind to ‘trainthe soul’ that characterises the Hermetic texts was also the wellspring of theirimmense influence on science and scientific thinking following their rediscoveryin the mid-15th century. By promoting the individual's quest for knowledge andillumination they would prove as powerful an antidote to the dogmas and receivedwisdoms of the Church during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment as theGnostic teachings of the Cathars had done in the Middle Ages. Nor in our view isit an accident, but an almost inevitable by-product of these closely-relatedsystems of thought – wherever and whenever they may be applied – that CatharGnosticism stimulated its own ‘mini-Renaissance’ across southern Europe in the12th century.We speculated in Chapter Two that this Cathar revolution in religious andphilosophical ideas, music and poetry, culture and social order, might havetransformed the world if the Church had not crushed it – utterly – in the 13thcentury. It's true that in the Balkans a few scattered Bogomils lingered on aslate as the 15th century. To all extents and purposes, however, we accept thatthe hitherto unbroken chain of Gnostic heresy stretching back to the dawn of theChristian era was snapped when the very last Cathar perfectus, WilliamBelibaste, was burnt at the stake in 1321.We find it rather remarkable, therefore, that another embodiment of essentiallythe same ideas should have slipped through the gates of Western culture lessthan 120 years later. We mean, of course, the Hermetic texts, their emergencefrom the wilderness after a millennium of silence, and their transferral to theMedici Academy in Florence in 1460.Either by accident or by some hidden design, they arrived at exactly the rightplace and time to bring alive again the ancient religion of ‘salvation throughknowledge’ that the Church thought it had just killed. In this latestincarnation, however, it would wear a much more overtly ‘ancient Egyptian’ andmuch less ‘Christian’ face. Perhaps for that very reason it would also set out amore positive and life-giving route towards the goal of world transformationthan Gnosticism, with its world-hatred, could ever have achieved.The Hermeticists shared the Gnostic view that evil is inherent in matter, andthus – through the body – in mankind. Yet they did not allow this recognition toseduce them into the mood of hopeless nihilism and species suicide that onesometimes senses could have led Cathar dualism down a very dark road. Far fromthat, the Hermetic ‘way’ accepted the human condition, sought our transformationthrough the elevation of the spiritual element within us, and handed theresponsibility directly to the individual and to his own conscience:It is man's duty not to acquiesce in his merely human state, but rather, in thestrength of his contemplation of things divine, to scorn and despise that mortalpart which has been attached to him because it was needful that he should keepand tend this lower world.64 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en779](Hermetica, Asclepius)Moreover ‘keeping and tending the lower world’ in the Hermetic scenario is not arepulsive and humiliating imprisonment in matter but a sacred responsibilitywith a vital role in the cosmic scheme of things that can only be fulfilled byman. The texts speak eloquently for themselves:Man is a being partly divine and partly mortal; not that he is to be thought thelower because he is mortal in part; we ought rather to regard him as exalted byhis mortality in that he is by such a lot more fitly and effectively constitutedfor a purpose preordained. For since he could not have met the demands of bothhis functions if he had not been made of both kinds of substance, he wasfashioned out of both, to the end that he might be able both to tend the earthand to do service to the Deity.65 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en780] Man is a marvel, then, Asclepius; honour and reverence to such a being! … Strongin the assurance of that in him which is divine, he scorns the merely human partof his own nature … He raises reverent eyes to heaven above; he tends the earthbelow … He has access to all; he descends to the depths of the sea by thekeenness of his thought; and heaven is not found too high for him, for hemeasures it by his sagacity, as though it were within his reach.66[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en781] To man is given charge of that part of the universe which consists of earth andwater; and this earthly part of the universe is kept in order by means of man'sknowledge and application of the arts and sciences. For God willed that theuniverse should not be complete until man had done his part.67[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en782] If man takes upon him in all its fullness the function assigned to him, that is,the tendence which is his special task, he becomes the means of right order tothe Kosmos, and the Kosmos to him.68[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en783]Despite the protests of scholars that there is no clear link between theHermetica and the religion of ancient Egypt, the pharaohs too believed that itwas their function, and the function of their divine land, to interact in thecorrect manner with heaven and thus to serve as a force for the maintenance ofright order (Ma'at) in the universe.69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en784] Indeed the pharaoh was a Hermeticking par excellence and we've suggested that one of the ways that he couldfulfil his responsibility to cosmic ‘right order’ would have been to build atemple, or even a city, ‘in the image of heaven’. We've shown specific textualauthority for such a course of action in the Book of What is in the Duat of the14th century BC. Likewise in the highly enigmatic Building Texts inscribed atthe Temple of Edfu in Upper Egypt in the third century BC the following wordsare put into the mouth of the god Thoth-Hermes himself:I will cause its [i.e. the temple's] long dimension to be good, its breadth tobe exact, all its measurements to be according to the norm, all its sanctuariesto be in the place where they should be, and its halls to resemble the sky.70[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en785]Dedicated to Horus, the golden son of Isis and Osiris, the Edfu temple was builtin several stages between 246 BC and 51 BC by pharaohs of the Graeco-EgyptianPtolemaic dynasty on a site that had been sacred since before 3000 BC. Althoughthere is no doubt that they took their conversion to the ancient Egyptianreligion extremely seriously, the Ptolemies were newcomers, having ruled Egyptonly from the late fourth century BC following the conquests of the god-kingAlexander the Great.Before his premature death in 323 BC Alexander founded a great city on Egypt'sMediterranean coast that would ever afterwards bear his name – Alexandria. A fewcenturies later it was here that Christian Gnosticism and its pagan Hermetictwin would emerge phoenix-like from the ashes of the ancient Egyptian religionand begin to wing their way silently towards the modern world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENCITY OF THE GOD-KINGThe city still shall follow you …Constantine P. Cavafy, Alexandrian poet (1863 – 1933), ‘The City’ Alexandria, the capital of memory !Lawrence Durrell, The Alexandria Quartet When alive, Alexander had founded a city; when dead? He gave birth to theuniversal metropolis …François de Polignac, L’Hombre d’Alexandre In the autumn of 332 BC, Alexander the Great marched triumphant into Egypt atthe head of his Macedonian army after it had crushed the Persians at the Battleof Issus in Syria. The Egyptians had been under much-detested Persian occupationfor nearly two centuries, and Alexander was now hailed as their liberator. Heentered the Nile Valley at Memphis and was immediately crowned pharaoh andlegitimate successor of the pharaohs – the divine solar kings who had ruled thisancient land since time immemorial.Alexander's behaviour at this point tells us much about his state of mind. Hisvery first act as pharaoh was to order the complete restoration and restitutionof the famous twinned temples of Karnak and Luxor in Upper Egypt (about 500miles south of Memphis) which had suffered damage and degradation under thePersians. Why did Alexander give this matter such priority? The answer is to befound in the strange circumstances of his birth in 356 BC.Alexander's mother, Olympias, was the daughter of the king of Ipirus (today partof northwestern Greece), and a high-priestress of the Temple-Oracle of Zeus-Amunat Dodona located southwest of the modern city of Ioannina. This oracle was oneof the most revered in the ancient world and the story of its foundation waslinked to the Temple of Amun at Karnak-Luxor in Egypt; it was also considered tobe ‘twinned’ to the Temple-Oracle at the Oasis of Siwa in Egypt – which waslikewise dedicated to Zeus-Amun. The Hellenic scholar Joan Wynne-Thomas,presents us with a concise overview of these connections:During the fourth century BC there were public sacrifices in Athens toZeus-Ammon, whose original cult was at the Siwa Oasis in Egypt. The cult was, ofcourse, Egypto-Greek, as Ammon or Amun, also in Egyptian Amun-Ra, was the allpowerful god of the Egyptian pantheon, whom the Greeks equated with their owngreat god, Zeus.1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en786]Any attempt to explore in detail how and why the Egyptian solar cult of Amun(Zeus-Amun) came to mainland Greece is outside the scope of this book. But thelegendary background is given by the ancient Greek historian, Herodotus, whovisited Egypt around 450 BC, a century or so before the birth of Alexander theGreat. This is the story as he reported it:About the oracles – that of Dodona in Greece and of Ammon in Libya [WesternEgypt or Siwa] – the Egyptians have the following legend: According to thepriests of the Theban Zeus [priests of Amun-Ra at Karnak-Luxor], two womenconnected with the service of the temple [Karnak-Luxor] were carried off by thePhoenecians and sold, one in Libya [Siwa] and one in Greece, and it was thesewomen who founded the oracles of these two countries. I asked the priests atThebes what grounds they had for being so sure, and they told me that carefulsearch had been made for the women at the time, and that though it wasunsuccessful, they had afterwards learned that the facts were just as they hadreported them. At Dodona, however, the priestesses who delivered the oracle had a differentversion of the story: two black doves flew away from Thebes [the district ofKarnak-Luxor] in Egypt, and one of them alighted in Dodona, the other in Libya[Siwa]. The former perched on an oak, and speaking with a human voice, told themthat there, on the very spot, there should be an oracle of Zeus. Those who heardunderstood this to be a command from heaven, and at once obeyed. Similarly, theother dove which flew to Libya [Siwa] told the Libyans to found the oracle ofAmmon – which is also an oracle of Zeus. The people who gave me this informationwere the three priestesses Dodona … 2[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en787]Also according to Herodotus, it was the Egyptians who originated and eventuallytaught the Greeks to use ‘ceremonial meetings, processions and liturgies’. Hesaid that the Greeks had even modelled their gods on those of the Egyptians.DODONA, OLYMPIAS, EGYPT AND THE PERSIANSNowadays such views are scoffed at by Hellenistic scholars and Egyptologistsalike. Despite the well-known tendency of the Greeks to ‘identify’ their godswith specific ancient Egyptian deities – e.g. Zeus-Amun or Hermes-Thoth – theacademic concensus is that the two pantheons as structurally unrelated. Yet itseems beyond doubt that the cult of Amun-Ra did find its way into Greece atleast as early as the fifth century BC, perhaps even much earlier, and wassomehow involved with the Temple-Oracle at Dodona.Dodona itself is located in the lovely pastoral and mountainous region of Ipirusadjacent to the ancient kingdom of Macedon where Alexander the Great was born.No one really knows the truth about exactly when or why it was consecrated, butaccording to consensus:The original shrine of the oracle probably existed before 2000 BC, and wasdedicated to the ‘Earth-mother’ or goddess. This was a cult of southern Greecewhich had, like the cult of Zeus, originated in the East. Archaeological findsdate from the Early Bronze Age, approximately 2500 BC, and are in the Museum ofIoannina. There is a mention of the shrine by Homer, in the Iliad, which is theearliest reference known …3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en788]The priests of Dodona were known as the helli or selli, and it was they whointerpreted the proclamations and prophecies made at the oracle. This they didby listening to the rustling of leaves from an oak grove within the sanctuary.Legend had it that it was from the wood of this sacred grove that a figureheadwas fashioned to the prow of Jason's ship carrying the Argonauts (hence theArgo’s gift of speech and prophecy).The Dodona temple-oracle was held in particular reverence by Philip II ofMacedon, the father of Alexander the Great, who had consulted it on numerousoccasions. But Philip's links with the oracle were to go much deeper when hemarried Olympias. The latter, as we have said, had been a priestess at Dodonaand is known to have been a zealous devotee of the god Amun of Egypt.Philip met Olympias when he was 26 years old and she 16. The fateful encountertook place on the island of Samothrace, off the Thracian coastline of Greece.Philip and Olympias had both come independently to the island in order to attendthe religious celebration of the Cabeiri, a curious festival where violentfertility and sexual rituals were performed in various mythical settings. It wasduring one of these events that Philip and Olympias fell in love, and thus beganthat potent union that was to change the course of world history.Endowed with a deep and mystical nature, the young and lovely Olympias wasobsessed with the idea that she was destined to bear a divine child in thelikeness of the god Dionysos – in Greek mythology the handsome and heroic son ofZeus, who had been born from the womb of the mortal Semele. Dionysos literallymeans ‘Son of God’, and Olympias would certainly have been acquainted with theworks of the Greek historian Herodotus who, a century earlier, had identifiedDionysos with the Egyptian god Osiris.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en789]When Olympias became Philip's queen in 357 BC, Egypt was under assault by thePersians, the most bitter enemies of the Greeks and Macedonians. In 525 BCCambyses, the son of the legendary Cyrus I, had occupied Egypt and thus widenedhis already vast empire. His successor, Darius I, consolidated Persian rule inthe Nile Valley after suppressing a major Egyptian revolt there. Then he tookhis army north across the Mediterranean and occupied Thrace and Macedon beforebeing decisively defeated at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. A decade laterthe Persian king, Xerxes, invaded Greece and brought terrible destruction onAthens, but he too was eventually defeated in 479 BC.Even though Darius and Xerxes had failed in Greece, the fear that a new Persianinvasion would be attempted at some point was a very real one. Neighbouringcountries were also targets. By 356 BC, when Alexander was born, Egypt had freedherself from Persian rule but was under attack again and was finally reoccupiedin 350 BC. Humiliated and defeated, Egypt suffered heavily under the new ‘Kingof Kings’ of Persia, Artaxerxes III, who was a brutal and merciless oppressor –as was his equally vicious son, Oarses. So despised was their rule that theywere eventually poisoned by one of their eunuchs called Bogoas, who offered thethrone of the King of Kings of Persia to Darius III. Bogoas was duly ‘rewarded’by being forced to swallow his own poison.NECTANEBO, OSIRIS, AND THE ANCESTRY OF ALEXANDERFor a brief period Egypt managed to oust the Persians yet again, and the lastnative pharaoh to rule there was Nectanebo II, who had usurped the throne fromhis brother Teos in 358 BC – two years before the birth of Alexander. There is atale told of Nectanebo II that seems worth recounting, even though it is almostcertainly fictional, in view of its association with the strange circumstancessurrounding Alexander's birth. But first we should place Nectanebo II in thecorrect historical setting.After initial successes in resisting the Persians, Nectanebo II was hailed byhis people as a great hero and liberator. Much loved for his military deeds andfor his devotion to the supreme god Amun (whose ‘son’ he deemed himself to be)he was also renowned as a powerful magician 5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en790] – a reputation that was taken veryseriously in ancient Egypt. As Alexander was to do some years later, Nectanebomarked his coronation by ordering a massive restoration programme for the manysanctuaries of Amun that had been destroyed or desecrated by the Persians. Hepaid special attention to the restoration of the temple complex of Karnak-Luxor.It had been Nectanebo's own father who had been partly responsible for themagnificent Avenue of Sphinxes (a segment of which survives to this day) thatjoined Karnak with Luxor. Nectanebo also restored the existing temples of Amunat the Oasis at Siwa, and built a magnificent new one there, the remains ofwhich still stand at the Umm Ubaydah area of the modern oasis.6[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en791]Married to Philip or not, we may imagine that the association of Nectanebo IIwith the Temple-Oracle of Amun at Siwa must have impressed the young Olympiaswho, as we recall, harboured dreams of giving birth to a ‘son of Amun’. Surelythe idea of being seeded by a pharaoh in whose veins flowed the blood of the godAmun, and who had such close links with the oracular centre of Amun at Siwa aswell as Luxor, would have been one of the wild fantasies of this veryimpressionable and very young queen? In this respect, the strange storiesreported by some of Alexander's biographers might contain an element of truth inthem. According to one such account found in Pseudo-Callisthenes, Nectanebo fledEgypt after the Persian invasion that ultimately dethroned him, and made his wayto Macedon in Greece. There he was received at the court of Philip II to whomNectanebo presented himself as a magician and astrologer. At night, however, theexiled pharaoh turned into a huge snake, a symbol of Amun, and in this formseduced and impregnated Olympias .7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en792]Another legend, this time associating the royal ancestry of Alexander the Greatwith the god Osiris of Egypt, is told by the Greek chronicler Diodorus Siculuswho lived in the first century BC. In Book I of his famous BilbiothecaHistorica, Diodorus recounts the mythical origins of the non-Hellenic andHellenic people of Greece up to the destruction of Troy. It is in this firstbook, that the story of Macedon, a mysterious ‘son’ of Osiris, is narrated.8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en793]According to Diodorus, Osiris left Egypt with his brother Apollo on a universalmission to teach men to plant the vine and sow crops of wheat and barley:… two sons of Osiris, Anubis and Macedon, … took the field with him … Osirisalso brought Pan [the Egyptian Min] on this expedition. [After visiting the countries of Africa and Asia] Osiris … crossed over intoEurope at the Hellespont. In Thrace he slew Lycurgos, a barbarian king whoopposed his plans … And he left his son Macedon behind as king of Macedonia,which was named after him …Diodorus does not give us his sources. It is generally thought that for the partof his Bibliotheca dealing with Greek history, he drew from the works of earlierwriters such as Ephorus and Hieronymus of Cardia. For his Egyptian material theevidence suggests that Diodorus relied heavily on Hecataeus of Abdera.Hecataeus (365 – 270 BC) lived in Alexandria – the prototypical city of theclassical world founded in Egypt by Alexander the Great. There Hecataeusbenefited from the liberal protection of Ptolemy I Soter, the general inAlexander's army who set himself up as pharaoh of Egypt in 305 BC afterAlexander's premature death. As a foreign traveller who reached as far south asthe temples of Karnak and Luxor, Hecataeus was an eyewitness to the early stageof Greek and Egyptian fusion in Egypt. He produced a rather idealised account,the Aegyptiaca, aimed at Greek readers, and it was this text that was to serveas Diodorus's source when he came to write his own history of Egypt 200 yearslater.Let us look at the context when Hecataeus was in Egypt. First, it is well knownthat Ptolemy I Soter was extremely keen to promote any idea that would integratehis newly founded ‘pharaonic’ Macedonian dynasty with that of the true Egyptiansolar pharaohs whose divine lineage was believed to extend back to the godOsiris. It is, therefore, quite possible that Hecataeus made up the story ofOsiris's journey to Greece and the founding of Macedon by one of his ‘sons’ –Macedon – in order to create a link between the Macedonian ‘pharaoh’ ofAlexandria and the mythical ancestry of Egyptian pharaohs.In Egyptian mythology Osiris had only one son, Horus, whose sacred animal wasnot the wolf, as Diodorus says, but the hawk or falcon. It is easy to see howsuch a mythological association between Osiris and the origin of the Macedonianroyal family, when it is also coupled with the strange tales told byPseudo-Callisthenes about the pregnancy of Olympias, would create a belief thatAlexander was somehow linked by birth to the gods of Egypt and, by extension,would add legitimacy to the Macedonian claim to pharaonic kingship inAlexandria. This strange belief and, especially, as we shall see, the persistenttheme of a symbolic sexual union between the god Amun and Olympias, would haveuntold repercussions on the future history of Egypt and, by cultural osmosis,the rest of the Hellenistic world.LIGHTNING SEED AND THE STAR SIRIUSLegend has it that when Olympias gave birth to Alexander the two stone eaglesthat decorated the roof of her apartments were struck by lightning. Otheraccounts speak of living eagles that came to perch there. Others say that atthat very same moment the Temple of Diana-Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed byfire while the goddess herself was in Macedon attending Alexander's birth. Thislink involving Diana-Artemis, eagles and the lightning bolt is most interesting.For Diana-Artemis was worshipped at Ephesus in the form of a sacred omphalos – aconical or pyramid-shaped stone which had supposedly ‘fallen from the sky’ asthough ejected from a lightning bolt It was also said that the foundation of theOracle of Apollo in Delphi occurred when two eagles sent from Zeus alighted nearthe omphalos there. Meanwhile in Egypt a pyramid-shaped ‘stone from heaven’called the Benben had formed the central symbol of religious worship at thesacred city of Heliopolis since before history began.9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en794] Indeed such baetyls and omphaliplayed a significant role in many ancient religions, and were typicallyassociated with fertility and the birth of divinities.According to Plutarch, Olympias claimed that she had become pregnant whenlightning had struck her womb and fertilised her with the seed of Zeus-Amun –thus siring Alexander.10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en795] ElsewherePlutarch narrates how the womb of the sacred cow-goddess of Egypt (a form ofIsis) was also seeded by the god's lightning in order to create the new Apiscalf, symbol of the ruling solar pharaohs, i.e. the Horus-king.11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en796] In Egyptian religious iconography,the goddess Isis was often represented by a cow with a five-pointed star aboveher head, the latter being the star Sirius, called Sothis by the Greeks.Traditionally the heliacal (dawn) rising of this star denoted the moment of thedivine birth of the solar kings of Egypt. It is therefore notable that manyclassical authors fix the birth of Alexander at 20 July in the Julian calendar,a date that would have been on or near the heliacal rising of Sirius in thatepoch. The implication is that this star must have played an important role inhis birth-myth. As French author Jean-Michel Angebert points out, it even ledAlexander to abandon the old Greek calendar and replace it with one like that ofthe Egyptians that was based on the heliacal rising of Sirius. He did this sometime before his armies reached Egypt:The doors of Egypt now lay open for him. But Alexander met up with furtherresistance at the port of Tyre, the siege of which lasted for six months, fromJanuary to July 332 BC, which Alexander did not want to leave behind. Thereoccurred, then, an extraordinary event: the taking of the city corresponded tothe astronomical date of the heliacal rising of Sirius, the Dog-star, whichmeant that the star, after having been absent in the sky for a part of the year[70 days], reappeared in the east horizon to mark the victory of Alexander andto announce that he would soon be wearing the crown of pharaoh … [thus]Alexander the Great, pious son of Amun, modified the Greek calendar such thathenceforth the rising of Sirius would mark the New Year, as it was done in Egypt…12 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en797]Further strengthening the sense of a definite association between Alexander andthe star Sirius, Jean-Michel Angebert also draws attention the so-called ascentto the sky of Alexander. This was an illustrative theme popularised in medievaltimes which showed the deified Alexander rising to heaven and the Sun on acarriage towed by griffins with a five-pointed star – identified as Sirius byAngebert – leading the way:Many scenes, sculptures, paintings and even jewellery represent this apotheosis… Concerning the ‘ascension’ of the hero, we often see Alexander standing in thechariot of Helios (the sun) pulled by griffins or lions; another type ofrepresentation shows him being carried on his throne; a third type showsAlexander being carried by eagles towards the sun. On all these representations,a star is seen shining over the head of the figure, an obvious symbol of Sirius,the celestial body which presides over the destiny of kings according to theEgyptians …13 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en798]This association with the ‘birth star’ Sirius is also found with Alexander'ssuccessors and in the city of Alexandria itself. For according to FrenchEgyptologist Sydney H. Aufrère, a specialist in Ptolemaic studies, 14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en799] the Ptolemaic queens wereportrayed wearing the headgear of the goddess Sothis i.e. Sirius. Aufrère alsoshows that the goddess of the Pharos, the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, oneof the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was once again none other thanSothis-Sirius. This strongly suggests that the spot of bright light thatmariners would see when approaching the coastline of Egypt was likened to thespot of light from the star Sirius when rising in the east to guide the marinersback to Alexandria.SON OF AMUNPlutarch also reported another version of the birth-myth of Alexander whichseems to be related to the Nectanebo story told by Pseudo-Callisthenes, but thistime without the presence of Nectanebo. In the Plutarch version Philip II peepedthrough the keyhole of Olympias's chamber on the night of their nuptials, andwas aghast to see his virginwife in their bed copulating vigorously with a hugesnake. Deeply shocked Philip went to consult the Oracle of Apollo at Delphiwhere he was told that he must henceforth make special sacrifice to Zeus-Amun,for the snake was a well-known symbol of Zeus-Amun.Another incident that also seems to reflect this link between Alexander andZeus-Amun concerns the city of Aphitis which surrendered to the forces ofPhillip II without a struggle on the day of Alexander's birth. The people ofAphitis were worshippers of Zeus-Amun on account of which, 150 years earlier,Aphitis had been spared by the great Spartan general, Lysander. This was becauseLysander himself was a devotee of Zeus-Amun and had actually performed apilgrimage to Siwa to consult the oracle there.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en800]After Alexander was crowned pharaoh of Egypt at Memphis and recognised as thelegitimate heir to Nectanebo II, he too set out with a small party of friends tothe Oasis of Siwa. His companions included his childhood friend, Ptolemy (future‘pharaoh’ of Egypt), and Callisthenes, the great nephew of Aristotle. Theyfollowed the desert route west from Rhakotis (the site of the future Alexandria)towards Mersa Matruh some 320 kilometers away. Today the journey from Alexandriato Mersa Matruh is covered in four hours by car, but Alexander and his grouptook at least week on horseback.From there the royal party turned due south and inland and began their slowmarch towards Siwa, which required a further eight days. Now, as it would havebeen in Alexander's time, the whole route is arid flat desert with only theoccasional mound or hill to change the monotony of the quasi-lunar landscape.After hours of this, however, the vista suddenly changes into a sort ofmini-Grand Canyon, and in the distance, like some desert Shangri La, spreads thelush oasis flanked by two lakes in the east and west.Upon entering Siwa, Alexander was hailed with the cries ‘son of Amun’. Withgreat ceremony he was then escorted to the Temple-Oracle of Zeus-Amun where hewas taken by the high-priest into the inner sanctuary. No one knows whathappened to Alexander there, or what he saw, but it is probable, amongst otherthings, that he was shown an omphalos sacred to Amun as evidence of his owndivinity.16 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en801]THE INTELLECTUAL PARENTHOOD OF ALEXANDRIAFar to the south of Siwa the city of Thebes, our modern Luxor, with its vasttemple complex dedicated to the supreme god, Amun, was the sacred city parexcellence of the ancient world even at the height of Greek civilisation. Andalthough Heliopolis – in the north of Egypt near the Great Pyramids – had beenpre-eminent in earlier times, it was now at Thebes that the solar kings of Egyptwere deemed to be legitimised and divinised. So it was perfectly natural, andindeed predictable, that Alexander the Great, in his capacity as the ‘son ofAmun’ would have wanted to link his own person to Thebes.This was why he acted so swiftly to restore the temple complex there, the mostimportant centre of Amun worship in Egypt. When we consider that he also had thetemple's inner sanctuary converted into a chapel bearing his own name it isclear that he soon intended to perform a pilgrimage to Luxor – there to beconsecrated, like all solar kings before him, as the ‘son of Amun’. Fateintervened, however, and Alexander died on campaign in Babylon. His troopsdecided that he should be buried in Egypt, in the land of his ‘father’Zeus-Amun.17 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en802]Ptolemy, now incontrol of Egypt, and soon to become pharaoh, intercepted the funerary cortegeand took command of the body of Alexander which, some years later, he wouldfinally bring to Alexandria.Alexandria had been Alexander's dream. He had wanted to create a new citydedicated to wisdom and learning – a sort of intellectual bridge on the shore ofthe Mediterranean Sea that would unite East and West. It was to be a city thatwould enlighten the world.When Alexander was a boy, his father, Philip II, selected for him a specialtutor. The choice fell on Aristotle, the greatest and most imaginative andinfluential philosopher of the epoch.Aristotle was born in the year 384 BC at the city of Stagira in Macedon. Hisfather, Nicomachus, was the personal physician and friend of the king ofMacedon, Amyntas III, the grandfather of Alexander the Great. At 17 Aristotletravelled to Athens and entered Plato's Academy, and soon became its most notedpupil, so much so that his master, Plato, called him the ‘intelligence of theschool’. When Plato died in 347 BC, Aristotle left the Academy and embarked on ajourney that took him to all parts of Greece and Asia Minor. Then in the year342 BC Philip II of Macedon summoned him to his court at Pella, and appointedhim tutor to his 14-year-old son, Alexander. Aristotle, who was now 42, broughtalong his brilliant nephew Callisthenes and also the scientist Theophrastus. Theteam of learned men were provided with a country residence at Mieza near Pellawhere, for the next three years, Alexander was tutored and groomed.When Alexander became king at the age of 21, Aristotle left Macedon and returnedto Athens, where he founded his famous Lyceum. It was there that he created thefirst prototype of a university library; it would eventually be transferredafter his death to the Great Library of Alexandria in Egypt. Aristotle died atthe age of 62, a year after Alexander's death in Babylon. His lectures werecollated in 150 volumes devoted to philosophy, ethics, politics and, his greatlove, the natural sciences. Until the middle ages Aristotle was regarded as thesupreme authority on all matters concerning science. He was to write, probablywith Alexander in mind, that:If there is one man superior in goodness and political capacity to all others,such a person may be like a god among men … and should be gladly obeyed, forthey are permanent kings.18 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en803]There is much speculation and debate as to what extent Alexander's sense ofmission might have been influenced by Aristotle. Apart from teaching thesciences to Alexander, the philosopher's main objective was to install in hispupil his concept of ‘virtues’, the most important of which, according toAristotle, was reason. A few years before Aristotle became tutor to Alexander,he had completed his famous work, the Politics, in which he examines varioussystems of constitutions and expounds on the idea of the ideal state. And itwould seem almost certain that Aristotle discussed his concept of the ‘idealstate’ with the young Alexander and imbued the future hero-king with those highvirtues and ideals that were eventually to be put into practice at Alexandria inEgypt.19 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en804] Alexander also receivedfrom Aristotle copies of Herodotus's Histories as well as Homer's Iliad andOdyssey, which became the future world-conqueror's most precious possessions.In the Odyssey Homer speaks of the fabled island of Pharos off the coast ofEgypt in connection with the Argonauts, while Herodotus recounts how Helen ofTroy and Paris took refuge at Heracleion, a few miles east of the futureAlexandria. So enthralled and influenced was Alexander by these epics thatapparently he once angrily slapped Callisthenes, the great nephew of Aristotle,for openly criticising Homer. It was such literary influences, and the influenceof his mother Olympias, that must have fired Alexander in his quest to weld theEastern and Western worlds into one great empire ruled from a capital ‘City ofLight’ modelled on the ideal state: Alexandria.THE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSAL CITYIt is often said that sound military principles are sufficient to explain whythe peninsula of Rhakotis on the Mediterranean Sea was chosen as the site ofAlexandria. The assumption is that Alexander saw in the natural harbour formedbetween the small island of Pharos and the peninsula the ideal place to build aport. Tradition has it that although Alexander had selected the site, it was thearchitect Dinocrates of Rhodes who actually designed the city. In opposition tothis view, we shall attempt to show that a strong Egyptian influence also castits spell over the whole enterprise from the very beginning.There was a kind of enchantment and magic about this place that was unlikely tohave been ignored by Alexander and his other educated companions such as Ptolemyand Callisthenes, especially in the high spirits and frame of mind they were in.They all were keen readers of Homer's works and surely were now acutely awarethat in the Odyssey Homer wrote:There is an island in the surging sea which they call Pharos, lying off thecoast of Egypt … It has a harbour with good anchorage and hence they [theArgonauts] put out to sea after drawing water.20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en805]To Alexander and his loyal companions, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey had the sameforceful effect as the Bible had on the crusading Christian knights in medievaltimes. Most educated Greeks could quite easily recite long sections from Homer,and often quoted Homer, as we do the Bible today, as the source of moral andpractical examples for daily life. Leaders such as Alexander – perhapsespecially Alexander – used the Iliad and the Odyssey not only for spiritual andmoral guidance, but also as a practical guidebook for their own lives. And thereis much to suppose that Alexander saw himself as a Homerian hero of boundlesscourage and dash.It must be realised that such heroes were not viewed by the Greeks asmythological and legendary characters but rather as real historical men andwomen who had lived in a golden age among the gods. When Alexander and hiscompanions came upon the island that Homer had described in such warm terms wemay therefore safely imagine that they took it as a favourable omen from thegods. It was recalled by Alexander and his engineers and architects thatPythagoras, the ‘father of geometry’, and likewise the noble Plato after him,had also sojourned in Lower Egypt as guests or ‘students’ of the Heliopolitanpriests and had learnt from them the wisdom that had made Greek culture great.Such evocative visions of Homer, Pythagoras and particularly Plato, the tutor ofAristotle himself, surely inspired the young conqueror, then barely 24 yearsold, to raise, near this magical Homerian island of Pharos, a great andwonderful city. What he had in mind was a metropolis that would rival Athens andin which the teachings of Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle could mingle with theancient wisdom of Egypt.So, using Pythagorean geometry, Alexander's architect, Dinocrates, began to drawthe plan of the future Alexandria, with Alexander himself supervising everysmall detail. The city, oblong in shape, would be developed on a system ofparallel grids. The main east-west artery, to be known as the Canopus Way, wouldbear the name of the Homerian hero Canopus, the legendary navigator who steeredthe ship bearing Helen of Troy. According to a legend, Helen and her lover,Paris, had taken refuge at the city of Canopus (modern Abu Qir) at the easternend of the Alexandrian shoreline on their way to Troy. Helen was the daughter ofthe god Zeus from his union with Leda, as well as the sister of the famousimmortals the Dioscuri, i.e. the twins Castor and Pollux, who became stars inthe zodiacal constellation of Gemini.HELEN OF TROY, THE EGYPTIAN APHRODITE AND ISIS-PHARIAThere is curious story told of Helen which is of relevance to the connectionAlexander the Great felt with Egypt, and gives us more background to hismystical claims to descend from the divine lineage of the pharaohs. This storyis found in a poem of Stesichorus ( 632 – 553 BC) which has it that afterescaping from her husband, King Menelaus, Helen and Paris attempted to sail toTroy. On the way their ship was driven by a storm to the shores of Egypt nearCanopus. Here the ‘real’ Helen was detained by the Pharaoh Proteus, whilst a‘phantom’ Helen – a very similar idea to the ‘phantom’ or ‘apparitional’ Christof the later Gnostic gospels – went on to Troy with Paris.Stesichorus's version of the story was later made into a play by Euripidesaround 412 BC, but underwent further mutation, placing the ‘real’ Helen in thecustody not of the legendary Proteus but of his equally legendary sonTheoclymenus. Herodotus, too, reports a somewhat similar story which he tells ushe obtained from an Egyptian priest.21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en806]He also speaks of a templededicated to ‘Aphrodite the Stranger’ in honour of Helen, within the royal cityof Memphis:Within the enclosure there is a temple dedicated to Aphrodite the Stranger. Ishould guess, myself, that it was built in honour of Helen, daughter ofTyndraeus, not only because I have heard it said that she passed some time atthe court of Proteus, but also, more particularly, because of the description ofAphrodite as ‘the Stranger’, a title never given to this goddess in any of herother temples (in Egypt).22 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en807]To the Greeks the ‘Egyptian Aphrodite’ was the goddess whom the ancientEgyptians called Hathor.23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en808] But theGreeks also associated the goddess Isis, in her loving aspect, with Aphrodite.This suggests that they appreciated the very close connection that does in factexist between Hathor and Isis in the ancient Egyptian pantheon and, presumably,the association that Hathor and Isis share with the star Sirius. In PtolemaicAlexandria Isis also became the protecting deity of the port and of its famouslighthouse, the Pharos (named after the island of Pharos on which it stood). Inthis capacity, Isis was known as Isis-Pharia, the protector of mariners,suggesting another connection with Helen of Troy who – presumably on account ofher many nautical adventures – was similarly called the ‘patron goddess ofsailors’.There was a temple dedicated to Isis-Pharia near the Pharos. Apparently also hercolossal statue once stood directly outside the Pharos, and is likely to havebeen perceived as part of the lighthouse complex. In Roman times Isis wasfrequently known as Stella Maris, i.e. ‘Star of the Sea’,24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en809] and the same epithet has, for avery long while, been applied by Christians to the Virgin Mary. Sir James GeorgeFraser, the great British mythologist of the 1920s goes so far as to suggest acausal link:To Isis in her later character of patroness of mariners the Virgin Mary perhapsowes her beautiful epithet of Stella Maris, ‘Star of the Sea’, under which sheis adored by tempest-tossed sailors. The attributes of a marine deity may havebeen bestowed on Isis by the seafaring Greeks of Alexandria. They are quiteforeign to her original character and to the habits of the Egyptians, who had nolove of the sea. On this hypothesis Sirius, the bright star of Isis, which onJuly mornings rises from the glassy waves of the eastern Mediterranean, aharbinger of halcyon weather to mariners, was the true Stella Maris, ‘the Starof the Sea’.25 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en810]Let us also note that many of the Ptolemaic queens of Alexandria, and especiallythe celebrated Cleopatra, identified themselves with Isis-Pharia or Isis-Sothis(Sirius) and, to emphasis their beauty and art of love-making, withIsis-Aphrodite as well. Glamorous Cleopatra posed as the goddess Isis-Aphroditewhen she presented herself to Mark Antony in Tarsus. According to EgyptologistJulia Samson:The dramatic couple quickly became linked in people's minds with the gods:Antony with Bachus (Dionysos) whom the Greeks associated with Osiris; andCleopatra with Venus (Aphrodite) and long associated with Isis …26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en811]The connection between Sothis-Sirius and Isis-Pharia of the Pharos is probablydue to the beacon of light from the lighthouse as it was seen from afar bysailors approaching the harbour, and may explain why the Pharos lighthouse wassometimes called ‘the second Sun’27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en812] – a term used by the ancientEgyptians for the star Sirius.28 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en813]At the Temple of Isis on the island of Pharos, the statue of the goddess wore acrown made up of a sun/ moon disc surmounted by two gazelle horns.29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en814] These horns, according to FrenchEgyptologist Sydney H. Aufrère, are similar to those of the goddess Satis, thedivine gazelle who watches over the Nile's flood.30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en815] The same headdress is seen onrepresentations of the Ptolemaic queens at temples in Upper Egypt such asDendera, Philae, Edfu and others. Dr. Aufrère also points out that Ptolemy III,in the Decree of Canopus of 238 BC, states how he had adjusted the religious andcivic calendars (which had become desynchronised with the passage of time) sothat the start of the new year would once again coincide with the heliacalrising of Sirius – an event which itself coincided closely with the beginning ofthe Nile's flood in mid-summer. Aufrère also offers this account of why one ofthe many names of Sirius was the ‘Eye of Ra’:In order to explain the mechanism of the Flood on the religious level, there waswitnessed at the opening of the new year a fusion or ‘coalescence’ of the solarand lunar myths, such that the ‘Distant One’ was considered both as the ‘Eye ofRa’ and the ‘Eye of Horus’ – in other words Sirius and the full Moon. The two –the star and the Moon – unite the magical effects of their manifestations whichresult in the Nile's Flood. Sirius by its rising announced the New Year and theFlood, and the full Moon symbolising the fullness of the latter.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en816]BRIEF EXCURSION TO PARISAccording to the French Egyptologist Bernard Mathieu:… Isis was named Pelagia (‘of the sea’), or Euploia (‘of safe navigation’) andPharia (‘of Pharos’), and was said to have invented the sail and had a temple onthe island of Pharos. She was so famous in the whole Mediterranean world that wefind her even in 17th century manuscripts, and comfortably installed on the prowof the boat on the coat-of-arms of Paris which Napoleon commissioned in 1811 …32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en817]The reader will recall from Chapter One the bizarre religious rituals andsymbolism of the French Revolution that frequently seemed to link the city ofParis explicitly to the goddess Isis. The comments made by Dr. Mathieu suggestthat such a link may have some basis in historical truth. It is also notablethat the 17th century writer, Jean Tristan, claimed that the name Paris wasactually derived from Isis-Pharia or, more precisely, was from Pharia-Isisabbreviated to Paria-Isis and, finally, to Paris.Tristan based his hypothesis on ancient coins dating from the time of the RomanEmperor Julian which depict his empress, Helen, as Isis-Pharia or Faria.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en818] Julian, who reigned some decadesafter Constantine, brought a very temporary halt to the onward march ofChristianity and was commonly known as ‘Julian the Apostate’ for havingre-adopted the ancient pagan cults and declared himself a ‘follower of Helios’,the sun-god. Helios in turn was a divinity whom the Romans closely associatedwith Alexander the Great.Julian had governed Gaul – ancient France – for five years and had resided inLutecia, ancient Paris, for three years between AD 358 and AD 360. Julian andhis wife Helen were also devotees of the Alexandrian god Serapis and the goddessIsis-Pharia, and may have imposed, or at the very least encouraged, her cult onthe inhabitants of Lutecia. At any rate, Jean Tristan was to write:The Parisians received their name of Paria-Isis, because of the cult of thisgoddess which had been introduced in Illyria and in Gaul, in the region next tothe River Seine and in Lutecia, called ‘Lutecia of the Parisians’ or Farisiansbecause of this.34 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en819]As further support to this hypothesis, the French classicist Jurgis Baltrušaitispoints out that in a fragment of a manuscript from Saint-Hilaire concerning theCouncil of Rimini, the city of Paris is actually referred by him as FariseaCivitas, i.e. the ‘city of the Farisians’ or, as Jean Tristan has suggested, thecity of those who worship Isis-Pharia or Faria-Isis (Pharia-Isis) .35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en820] We shall return to this in a laterchapter.THE CANOPUS WAYThe Roman writer Arrian tells us that when Alexander came to the site on thecoast where his future city, Alexandria, would rise:… he was taken by a strong desire to carry out his project, and setting outhimself the plan of the city, he fixed the place where the Agora should go, thenumber of sanctuaries and to which deities [they were dedicated]: the Greek godsbut also to Isis, goddess of Egypt …36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en821]The Agora was the equivalent of a town hall or square where public meetings wereheld in Greek cities. In the case of Alexandria the Agora was located at theintersection of two main arteries, the north-south artery known as the Soma andthe east-west artery known as the Canopus Way. This arrangement formed a hugecross and it was at the intersection of its two arms, according to mostaccounts, that was eventually raised a small Doric temple to serve as themausoleum for the golden sarcophagus of Alexander the Great.At both ends of the Canopus Way were gates. The west gate was called the ‘Gateof the Moon’ (Selene) while the east gate was the ‘Gate of the Sun’ (Helios).It has always been assumed that the physical layout of Alexandria was designedin accordance with the principles of Greek city planning based on a rigid gridsystem with sets of parallel roads crisscrossing each other at right angles. Infact such grid plans were also known in Egypt long before the Greeks. The FrenchEgyptologist, André Bernand, rightly observes that the Giza necropolis in thearea of the Great Pyramids is effectively a mortuary city gridded with roadsrunning east-west and north-south. A similar scheme can be seen at Saqqara and,much further south, at Akhetaten (modern el-Amarna), the city of PharaohAkhenaten.37 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en822]This notwithstanding, what is often not considered as a direct influence on thedesign of Alexandria is the state of mind of the 24-year-old Alexander the Greatat the time of the foundation of the city. He had just conquered the hithertoinvincible solar Persian King of Kings, Darius III, and was now the undisputedruler of the known world. He had been hailed as hero and liberator by theEgyptians, and recognised as the legitimate successor of Pharaoh Nectanebo II.He had been proclaimed the ‘son of Amun’ and ‘son of Isis’ plus all the othertitles attributed to a legitimate pharaoh of Egypt. And all this had happenedalmost certainly immediately before the foundation of the city of Alexandria.Another factor to note is Alexander's deep psychological identification with thetemple complex of Karnak-Luxor at Thebes as an expression of his identificationwith the god Amun. The French scholar François de Polignac has pointed out thatAlexander demonstrated an unusual knowledge and sensitivity to Egyptianreligious customs by paying so much attention to the restoration of this templeand, more particularly, by grafting his own name onto the inner sanctuary nearthe temple's sacred ‘birth room’ or mammisi. These acts suggest that Alexandermust have been closely advised by a native Egyptian high-priest, probably muchin the same way that the high-priest Oud-ja-Hor-esne of Sais had acted asadvisor to the Persian king, Cambyses, and the high-priest Manetho of Heliopoliswas to become senior advisor to Ptolemy I Soter, the successor of Alexander theGreat in Egypt.38 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en823]We have seen how Alexander had developed a connection with the star Sirius, thestar of Isis and divine birth, when he changed the Greek calendar at Tyre. Wehave seen, too, how the rising of this star was the ‘calibrator’ of the Nile'sflood and we will show in a later chapter how its position on the easternhorizon often served to align the axis of ancient Egyptian temples dedicated tothe birth of Horus, the ‘son’ of Isis-Hathor. Finally, we have also noted thatthe heliacal rising of Sirius during Alexander's lifetime fell on the ‘official’date of his birth, i.e. 20 – 21 July (Julian).It would be odd, indeed improbable, if such a rich network of symbols,ideologies and mythical associations had not influenced Alexander when he wasabout to supervise the design of a city on the Mediterranean shore of Egyptopposite the enchanted island of Pharos …BRIEF EXCURSION ON NAPOLEON AND SIRIUSBefore Napoleon invaded Egypt and occupied Cairo at the end of the 18th centuryhe commissioned the famous mathematician Gaspard Monge to round up a group ofthe finest scholars – called the lumières or ‘lights’ in those days – toaccompany the expedition. Comprising a total of 167 men, the group of savantsincluded the mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, the chemist ClaudeLouis Berthollet, the naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, the geologistDéodat de Dolomieu, the geographer Edme François Jomard and the engineerNicolas-Jacques Conté. Such men were to form the basis of Napoleon's Institutd’Égypte, a sort of academy of science – the first of its kind ever to studyancient Egyptian monuments – founded on 22 August 1798, very soon after theinvasion. Dominique Vivant-Denon, a painter and a favourite of the futureempress, Joséphine, became the Institute’s first director while Monge was madeits first president.The reader may recall from Chapter One that Monge was a Freemason and aprominent member of the Nine Sisters lodge in Paris. He was instrumental increating the so-called Republican calendar which, we also saw in Chapter One,was almost certainly modelled on the ancient Egyptian civic calendar‘calibrated’ by the heliacal rising of Sirius. On 22 September 1798 the firstvolume of the Institut d’Égypte’s journal was published. Its title was theDécade égyptienne, a name selected by Monge to evoke this new Republicancalendar.It was on 5 March 1798 that Napoleon left Paris for Toulon to meet up with thefleet that he had readied to sail for Egypt. And it was on 21 July 1798 thatNapoleon engaged the Egyptian Mameluk army at the Battle of the Pyramids.Whether by design or by chance is yet to be decided but it is a fact that boththese dates have a direct association with Isis, her ‘boat’ and her ‘star’. Inancient Rome 5 March had marked the well-known Feast of Navigium Isidis orIsis-Pharia, when an effigy of the goddess seated in her boat was carried inprocession around the city. And 21 July (Julian) was the date of the heliacalrising of Sirius. Coincidence? Perhaps. But we shall return to such issues inlater chapters.MAPPING ANCIENT ALEXANDRIAAfter Napoleon, the fine example set by the Institut d’Égypte later prompted thenew ruler of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha, to fund the education and training ofEgyptian scholars in France. His most prominent scholar was the astronomerMahmoud El Falaki, better known as Mahmoud Bey, who was to found the firstmodern astronomical observatory in Egypt. Mahmoud Bey was also trained as anengineer and geographer, a combination that was to serve him well in his‘Alexandria mapping project’ that was to come later under Khedive Isma'il in1865. Perhaps it should be also noted that Mahmoud Bey's numerous othercontributions in science, such as the charting of geomagnetic and meteorologicalphenomena around the globe, earned him the respect and official praise of theBelgian as well as the French Académie des Sciences.During his Alexandria mapping project, Mahmoud Bey carried out excavations andthrough them was able to determine that there had been eleven main streetsrunning parallel along the width of the ancient city, and seven main streetsalso running parallel but at right angles to the other eleven. The two principalarteries were confirmed as the Canopus Way running the length of the city andthe Soma running the width of the city, thus, as we've observed, forming a huge‘cross’ by their intersection.Some European archaeologists were quick to criticise Mahmoud Bey's ‘reborn’ planof ancient Alexandria, but according to Dr. Jean-Yves Empereur, director of theCentre of Alexandrian Studies in Egypt:… In spite of the criticisms levelled at it in the later 19th century, this planis still used by archaeologists today … Mahmoud El Falaki decided to publish hisplan in Copenhagen in 1872, six years after he had completed it. It is anoutstanding work, reflecting the considerable resources employed in itsproduction, rendered even more effective by the support of the Khedive and thesolid training of its maker. Almost a century and a half after its publicationit is still used as a reference work by archaeologists working in Alexandria.39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en824]THE GATE OF THE SUN AND THE GATE OF THE MOONAfter digging several trial pits and trenches, Mahmoud Bey was able to establishthat the Canopus Way was approximately 2300 meters long and that its axis wasoriented to a point on the horizon about 24° north-of-east. 40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en825] Two factors indicate that thisalignment was not accidental but was interwoven in the astronomical ideologiesprevailing at the time. The first, of course, is the conspicuous angle of 24°north-of-east which immediately brings to attention a possible solar alignmentclose to the summer solstice. The other factor, perhaps even more obvious, isthat the gate on the eastern side of the Canopus Way was called the Gate ofHelios, i.e. the ‘Gate of the Sun’, again strongly suggestive of a solaralignment. The sun's rising points on the eastern horizon as observed fromAlexandria fluctuate between 28° south-of-east (winter solstice) and 28°north-of-east (summer solstice), with the mid-point, due east, falling on thespring and autumn equinoxes.In his Life of Alexander the famous first century author Plutarch tells us:Alexander was born the 6th of Hecatombaeon, which month the Macedonians callLous, the same day that the Temple of Diana at Ephesus was burnt …41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en826]Hecatombaeon, or Hekatombaion, the first month in the ancient Greek year, beganon the first new moon immediately following the summer solstice. From this, manychronologists have calculated that Alexander must have been born on 20 July (inthe Julian calendar) or very near to that date. Since this was also the time ofyear when the Sun rose in the zodiac sign of Leo, it may explain the powerfulleonine symbolism that ancient writers associated with Alexander's birth andcharacter.42 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en827]The persistent mythological connections between Alexander and Diana, which weexplored earlier, are also of interest. Diana, the Artemis of the Greeks, wasoften identified with the Egyptian goddess Isis, the mother of Horus, themythical prototype of the solar pharaoh-kings of Egypt with whom Alexander waskeen to identify. These ‘Horus-kings’ were traditionally believed to be bornunder the protection of the star Sirius, the heliacal rising of which was thecelestial sign that divinised and legitimised the reign of each and every futureking of Egypt. It is a verifiable astronomical fact, and in our view mostunlikely to be a coincidence, that the helical rising of Sirius in Alexander'sepoch occurred on 20 July as seen from the latitude of Egypt's ancient capitalMemphis. Tradition has it that it was Alexander himself who fixed the centralaxis of the future city of Alexandria, later to be known as the Canopus Way. Itis thus also unlikely to be coincidental that this axis turns out to have beenaligned approximately 24° north-of-east, targeting the point of sunrise on theday of the heliacal rising of Sirius through the appropriately named ‘Gate ofthe Sun’.Alexander, admittedly promiscuous in his choice of divine ancestors, is known tohave claimed descent from Dionysos and Heracles – both of whom were associatedwith the Egyptian god Osiris by Herodotus, one of Alexander's favourite authors.Bearing this in mind, let us note that if we extend the axis of the Canopus Wayfurther in the direction of the horizon we find it passing the ancient city ofHerakleion (later submerged by an earthquake and recently relocated by marinearchaeologists in Abu Qir Bay). At least since the time of Herodotus it wasknown that a temple dedicated to Heracles-Osiris had stood at Herakleion.The Gate of the Moon at the other (western) extremity of the Canopus Way mayalso have had astronomical connotations linked to the myth of Isis and Osiris.We've seen that Isis, and the many Ptolemaic queens who emulated her, werecommonly depicted with the full-moon disc and/or lunar crescent above theirheads – a motif that continued to be used for the goddess-queens of Alexandriain Graeco-Roman times. Cleopatra is well known to have identified herself with‘Isis and the Moon’, and when she bore twins – a boy and girl – by Mark Antony,she called them Selene (Moon) and Alexander-Helios (Sun), clearly an allusion toIsis and Osiris/ Dionysos as well as to the city of Alexandria itself with itsMoon and Sun gates. In order for a full moon to occur, it must be in almostdirect opposition to the Sun. This seems to explain why the west end of theCanopus Way was named ‘Gate of the Moon’ and the eastern extremity named ‘Gateof the Sun’.With all such possible symbolic alignments it would seem likely, if not certain,that the city of Alexandria was sacred to Isis or, more specifically, toIsis-Pharia who dovetailed perfectly with the Alexander-Dionysos-Helios myth.Indeed, so important was Isis to Alexandria that she became effectively itsco-tutelary deity being held in equal reverence to its very ownspecially-invented supreme god Serapis. The reader will recall from Chapter Fivethat it was within the compound of the great Temple of Serapis in Alexandria –the Sarapeum – that a great number of Gnostics and so-called pagans weremassacred by Christian mobs in the late fourth century AD.THE MAKING OF A UNIVERSAL GODWhen Alexander the Great died on campaign in Babylon in 323 BC, his vast empirewas split into smaller dominions to be shared among his generals. His closestfriend, Ptolemy, son of Lagos, inherited the kingdom of Egypt and was crownedpharaoh in 305 BC after the death of Alexander IV (the son of Alexander theGreat by the Persian Princess Roxanne). Ptolemy adopted the name Soter, meaningthe ‘Saviour’, and thus is best known to historians as Ptolemy I Soter.A very wise and enlightened man, Ptolemy set out to fulfil Alexander's dream tomake his city, Alexandria, a universal centre of wisdom and learning. Herecruited as his principal advisor an Egyptian high-priest from Heliopoliscalled Manetho, and consulted him on all matters related to religion, historyand protocol. Manetho, who came from the Delta city of Sebennytos, is best knownto Egyptologists for having compiled a chronology of all the dynastic andpredynastic pharaohs which, to a great extent, is still used as reference today.It is almost certain, too, that Manetho was the principal contributor to thecreation of the ‘new’ god Serapis for the city of Alexandria.It seems that Ptolemy I Soter wanted to find an ideal deity for the cosmopolitancitizens of the universal city of Alexandria – the latter now perceived as thesymbol of a regenerated Egypt that he, Ptolemy, was destined to govern. Thechoice quite naturally went towards the most revered of Egyptian gods, Osiris,or, to be more specific, as we saw in Chapter Five, to a special form of Osirisknown as Osiris-Apis, the Wesir-Hapi of the ancient Egyptians. This linkedOsiris to the worship of the bull-god Apis, a very ancient cult with its maincentre at Memphis in Lower Egypt.43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en828] According to Herodotus, whovisited Egypt when this cult still flourished, the sacred Apis bull was:The calf of a cow which is incapable of conceiving another offspring; and theEgyptians say that lighting descends upon the cow from heaven, and that fromthence it brings forth the Apis. This calf, which is called Apis, has thefollowing marks: it is black, and has a square spot of white on the forehead;and on the back the figure of an eagle …44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en829]Indeed, the Apis bull was said to be born from the womb of a sacred cow known as‘Isis’, and when the Apis bull died he was considered to have become Osiris. AsEgyptologist George Hart states:Following concepts about the dead pharaoh in the Underworld, Apis, upon dying,became the god Osiris. It is the sacred bull of Memphis in his form ofOsiris-Apis that provides the Egyptian nature of the hybrid god created underearly Ptolemaic rulers known as Serapis.45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en830]The close similarity between the Apis bull cult and the Isis and Osiris cult isobvious. And the close identification between the Apis calf and the Horus childsaid in Egyptian mythology to have been born from the womb of Isis is thusinescapable: (1) The Apis bull was associated with the Horus-king or livingpharaoh; (2) the sacred ‘Isis’ cow became pregnant by divine intervention in thesame manner that the goddess Isis had become pregnant; (3 ) the sacred ‘Isis’cow bore only one calf in the same way Isis had born only one son; (4) the Apisbecame ‘Osiris’ after death in the same way that the Horus-king – the pharaoh –was also devoutly believed to became ‘Osiris’ after death. As Hart furtherexplains:The pharaoh identifies closely with Apis-bull imagery (with its inherent notionof strength and fertility) being an ancient characteristic in the propaganda ofthe god-king, as can be seen from carved slate palettes and in one of the namesused in the royal protocol ‘victorious bull’. Celebrating his jubilee festival,a ceremony concerned with the rejuvenation of the monarch's power, the pharaohstrides briskly alongside the galloping Apis bull. The ritual which took placeat Memphis is vividly portrayed in a relief on a block from a dismantled chapelin the Temple of Karnak at Thebes …46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en831]A contemporary account of the Apis cult is given by Diodorus Siculus, whovisited Egypt in the first century BC. Diodorus describes the funeral of theApis bull in much the same terms as that of a pharaoh:After the splendid funeral of Apis is over those priests who have charge of thebusiness seek out another calf as like the former as they can possibly find, andwhen they have found one an end is put to all the mourning and lamentation, andsuch priests as are appointed for that purpose lead the young bull through thecity of Nile and feed him forty days. Then they put him into a barge wherein isa golden cabin and so transport him as a god to Memphis … For the adoration ofthe bull they give this reason: they say that the soul of Osiris passes into abull and therefore whenever the bull is dedicated, to this very day the spiritof Osiris is infused into one bull after another for posterity.47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en832]The most crucial aspect of the ancient Egyptian mystery religion is that the‘son of Osiris’ i.e. Horus, was perpetually reincarnated in the person of thepharaoh, and after each pharaoh died he became ‘Osiris’ while his eldest sonbecame the new living ‘Horus’. Or to put it another way, each successive pharaohwas the living embodiment of Horus while, at the same time – as was the casewith the Apis bull – it was held that his soul would become ‘Osiris’ after hisdeath. It can be seen, therefore, that the idea of the combined name‘Osiris-Apis’ – which transmutated to Serapis – was modelled on the idea of‘Osiris-Horus’ and, consequently, must be understood to be the ultimate namethat symbolises the legitimacy and divinity of the ruling pharaoh.This is precisely how Alexander the Great wanted to be perceived by the world,and this was also in the mind of Ptolemy when he was crowned the successor ofAlexander in Egypt. When, in the summer of 323 BC, Alexander lay dying inBabylon from malaria (made worse by drinking excessive quantities of wine as a‘cure’), his priests prepared a makeshift Temple of Osiris-Apis, i.e. Serapis,in his encampment, leaving us with no choice but to conclude that Alexander hadembraced this god as his own. According to the official royal journal kept bythe scribe Eumenes,48 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en833] Alexanderwas seized by a violent fever on 4 June which persisted for several days and, by8 June, it was becoming clear to all that he was dying:8 June: The fever continues. The Macedonians, thinking that he was dead, camescreaming to the gates of his palace and insisted to see him. The doors wereopened. They all passed in procession in front of the bed. In silence he[Alexander] greeted each of them by nodding his head or by making a sign withhis eyes. In the Temple of Serapis, Peithon, Attalos and Demophon [Alexander'sclose companions] slept in turn waiting for an oracle from the god to tell themif they should transport Alexander to his sanctuary for him to be cured. Thefever continued all night. 9 June: Same condition [the king is now in a coma]. New consultation of the god[‘father’ of Alexander] by Kleomenes, Menidas and Seleukos who relayed in theTemple of Serapis to sleep and to consult the god. 10 June: The god gave his reply, which was not to bring Alexander to the templeas he was better off where he lay resting. The companions reported this to thesoldiers. A short while later, towards evening, Alexander died.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en834]The above text make it clear that a temple or shrine of Serapis had been raisedsomewhere near Alexander's palace in Babylon, and that this god was consultedover a matter of great importance – i.e. whether or not Alexander's body shouldbe transported to the principal ‘sanctuary’ of Serapis, i.e. Osiris-Apis, inEgypt. There is an apparent anomaly in the text which refers to Serapis as the‘father of Alexander’ when we know that Amun of Siwa already filled that role.But perhaps in the minds of the Macedonians at least, no clear distinction wasmade between Serapis and Amun, since both in the Egyptian tradition were‘fathers’ to the pharaohs. Herodotus clearly equates Amun of Siwa with Zeus,50[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en835] and we know that Serapis was alsoequated with Zeus by the Alexandrians.THE LABYRINTH OF SERAPISThe main sanctuary of the Osiris-Apis bull (Serapis) was near Memphis in LowerEgypt, not far from the complex of the Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara. Here, fromat least 1400 BC, successive generations of Apis bulls were buried, in hugestone sarcophagi, in a subterranean labyrinth known today as the Serapeum (thesame name applied to the Temple of Serapis at Alexandria). Herodotus, who wrotehis Histories a century before Alexander's arrival in Egypt, is the firstforeigner to mention the ‘Temple of Apis’. It probably was still operationalwell into Christian times, but by the middle ages the Serapeum had beencompletely buried in sand and its location forgotten. It was not until 1850 thatit was re-discovered by the French archaeologist, Auguste Mariette. The storygoes that Mariette, while trekking in the desert near Saqqara, stumbled on oneof the many small sphinxes mentioned by the ancient geographer, Strabo, that hadonce had flanked the processional road leading to the Serapeum. He was to laterwrite:‘One finds,’ said the geographer Strabo [first century AD], ‘a temple to Serapisin such a sandy place that the wind heaps up the sand dunes beneath which we sawsphinxes, some half buried, some buried up to the head, from which one cansuppose that the way to this temple could not be without danger if one werecaught in a sudden wind storm.’ Did it not seem that Strabo had written thissentence to help us rediscover, after over eighteen centuries, the famous templededicated to Serapis? It was impossible to doubt it. This buried Sphinx, thecompanion of fifteen others I had encountered in Alexandria and Cairo, formedwith them, according to the evidence, part of the avenue that led to the MemphisSerapeum …51 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en836]Inspired by his find, Mariette organised a workforce and, within a few weeks,had uncovered the entrance to the Serapeum which, even today, remains a hugelyimpressive and awe-inspiring place. It is located about a kilometer to thenorthwest of the stepped Pyramid of Djoser, and is approached from the eastthrough a sloped alley going downwards into the bowels of the sand-rock desert.The vastness of this underground maze is what first hits you, with its dark andsprawling corridors running in several directions like a hellish labyrinth builtfor giants. Today there is lowwattage electric lighting but even so, if leftwandering alone in this strange Hades, one is gripped by a curious sense ofuneasiness, a sort of slow panic that mingles with the eerie and deathlystillness. There is something almost unnatural and something almost superhumanhere. For what is seen all along the huge tunnels and corridors are dozens anddozens of enormous sunken niches, the size of large living rooms, in which wereinserted massive granite sarcophagi that once contained the mummified corpses ofthe Apis bulls. The size and weight of these sarcophagi – some over 60 tons andcut from a single block of granite – fires the imagination for, at least on facevalue, it is very difficult to see how they were brought down here in the firstplace let alone manoeuvred into the niches. One has the sense that deep and darkmysteries were performed here. Their atmosphere still lingers – the chargedresidue of place where, in the words of the ancient Greeks, men were transformedinto gods.ALEXANDER'S RETURNNectanebo II (the ‘father’ of Alexander in some legendary accounts) had his tombbuilt not far from the Serapeum at Saqqara.52[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en837] Could this have played a part inthe strange events that took place after Alexander's death and the dilemmaconfronting his generals and officers as to where the remains of their heroicdemi-god should be taken? For while still in Babylon, the body of Alexander wasprepared in the ancient Egyptian manner by embalmers brought specially for thistask. Alexander's body was then placed within a golden sarcophagus and a hugecatafalque was built – the size of a house on wheels according to some eyewitnesses – in order to transport the dead hero-god back to Egypt.The journey took almost two years . Finally when it arrived at the borders ofEgypt the catafalque was met by Ptolemy and the golden sarcophagus taken toMemphis. There it was buried near the Serapeum in a sumptuous tomb befitting thehero-god. So entrenched is the idea that Alexander's ‘lost tomb’ lay hidden inAlexandria that it generally comes as a surprise for some to know that hiscoffin remained at Memphis for at least ten years, and perhaps even longer,before finally being taken to Alexandria. At that time the city of Memphis wasstill the capital of Egypt, and the Temple of Heliopolis was still functioningas the priestly school for the state. As for Ptolemy himself, he was stillsatrape, i.e. governor of Egypt, under the authority of Alexander IV, the son ofAlexander the Great by his Persian wife, Roxanne. In 310 BC, however, when theAlexander IV was 13, he was assassinated, and the succession not settled.Against this background, five years later, Ptolemy seized his chance anddeclared himself pharaoh of Egypt in 305 BC.We may guess that it was to strengthen and symbolise his own legitimacy as thetrue successor of Alexander the Great that Ptolemy transferred Alexander'sgolden sarcophagus, and along with it the cult of Serapis-Osiris-Apis, to thenewly built city of Alexandria. It is also likely that the kernel of the futureGreat Library of Alexandria was brought at this time from the greattemple-library at Heliopolis.This then was the manner in which Alexandria was turned into the new ‘capital’of Egypt and created the great spark of enlightenment that was to illuminate theWestern world at the time of the Renaissance.A SPECIAL GNOSISIt has long been recognised that the ancient Egyptians did not have a ‘religion’– at least not in the sense that we understand the meaning of this word today.And although the term Egyptian ‘religion’ has been extensively used inEgyptology, and we ourselves use it in this book, the fact remains that itcannot be found in the vocabulary of the ancient Egyptians. It simply does notexist. As the eminent Egyptologist and philologist Alan H. Gardiner explains:From the Egyptian point of view we may say that there is no such thing as‘religion’; there was only heka, the nearest English equivalent of which is‘magical power’ …53 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en838]Everything about the ancient Egyptian monuments and texts leads us to supposethat heka, i.e. magical powers, were believed to be acquired through a veryintense spiritual and intellectual learning process involving elaborate andsecret initiations. Heka was a sort of sacred science or, as we prefer to callit, a special gnosis, and it was thought to be the gift of Thoth, the ancientEgyptian god of wisdom (the Hermes Trismegistus of the Greeks). According toBritish Egyptologist Patrick Boylan, professor of Eastern languages atUniversity College Dublin:Thoth … is god of wisdom and orderer of the cosmos. His word has to call thingsinto being … [and is] endowed with magical powers. Magic presupposes always aspecial Gnosis. The magician claims to possess a higher and deeper knowledge ofthe secret nature of things, and the hidden connection which holds thingstogether. He is the wise one whose words have power to control mysteriousforces, and to ward off invisible perils. And the magician does all this by thepower of his special gnosis … 54 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en839]This special gnosis or magical knowledge was said to have been gathered by Thothand written in sacred books which, according to a legend found in the EgyptianBook of the Dead, were taken to the Temple of Heliopolis by the goddess Hathor,whose star, the reader will recall, was Sirius.55[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en840] A rather similar legend thatassociates Thoth and his sacred books to the city of Heliopolis is found in theWestcar Papyrus. In this 3500-year-old text a story is told about a magicianbrought to the court of Pharaoh Khufu, the legendary builder of the GreatPyramid at Giza. Khufu is keen to find the secret chamber of Thoth (presumablywhere the magical ‘books’ were kept) in order to design his pyramid, and he istold by the magician that it will be found at Heliopolis in some sort of‘inventory room’ or library or hall of scriptures and records.56[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en841] This story therefore associatesthe idea of the pyramid with the magical knowledge of Thoth – knowledge, as weshall see, that was specifically connected to the stars. As the FrenchEgyptologist and author Christian Jacq asserts:The greatest centre of magic in Egypt was probably the holy city of Heliopolis,the city of the sun, where the most ancient theology developed. Here werepreserved numerous papyri, ‘magic’ in the widest sense of the word, includingmedical, botanical, zoological and mathematical texts. Most Greek philosophersand savants travelled to Heliopolis to study some of that knowledge … 57[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en842]Jacq then goes on to say that at Heliopolis and other similar learning centreswas practiced the most ‘sacred science that requires specialists trained formany years to grasp the most secret forces of the universe.’58[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en843] Everything points to the fact thatthe most important aspect of this ‘sacred science’ or special gnosis, rested onthe belief that the influences and powers of the stars could be somehow drawndown to earth. As Christian Jacq and others have pointed out, the edifices ofthe ancient Egyptian sacred science rested on the fervent conviction that innateobjects such as amulets, statues, shrines, monuments, temples and even wholecities could be imbued with the divine essence of the star-gods which washarnessed with the application of heka i.e. magic.Western civilisation in the 21st century does not, by and large, believe inmagic. Earlier civilisations did and the ancient Egyptians were emphaticallyamongst them. What they understood by heka however, does not necessarily accordwith modern ideas of magic at all and therefore needs to be clearly defined.According to Dame Frances Yates of the University of London, who made a lifetimestudy of these matters:The type of magic with which we are to be concerned differs profoundly fromastrology which is not necessarily magic at all but a mathematical science basedon the belief that human destiny is irrevocably governed by the stars, and thattherefore from the study of a person's horoscope, the position of the stars atthe time of his birth, one can foretell his irrevocably foreordained future.This magic is astrological only in the sense that it too bases itself upon thestars, their images and influences, but it is a way of escaping fromastrological determinism by gaining power over the stars, guiding theirinfluences in the direction which the operator desires. Or, in the religioussense, it is a way of salvation, of escape from material fortune and destiny, orof obtaining insight into the divine. Hence ‘astrological magic’ is not acorrect description of it, and hereafter, for want of a better term, I shallcall it ‘astral magic’ …59 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en844]Frances Yates, as we shall see in the next chapter, was speaking here not ofancient Egyptian ‘astral magic’ but, more specifically, of the revival of theEgyptian magical religion during the Italian Renaissance. But she might as wellalso have referred to ancient Egypt itself, for the definition she gives coversprecisely the sort of ‘astral magic’ that seems to have existed in Egypt sincetime immemorial.A TIME OF CHANGEIn the years after the coronation of Ptolemy I Soter as the successor ofAlexander the Great, the city of Alexandria began to flourish. First amagnificent tomb was built to house Alexander's coffin and then variousmonumental and religious projects were planned. Most notable among these werethe Pharos, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the great temple andlibrary complex of Serapis – the Alexandrian Serapeum – and, of course, thelegendary Library of Alexandria.It was at the Alexandrian Serapeum that the Ptolemies regenerated the cult ofSerapis, the supreme universal god, and where a huge statue of the Serapis waserected. And at the Pharos, as we have already seen, was raised a great templededicated to Isis, ‘consort’ of Serapis, but now specially designated in thisnew maritime city as Isis-Pharia.As for the famous library, this was dedicated to the seven muses or sisters,patrons of music and the arts. It is most likely that much of the library'soriginal collection was derived from stocks brought from other parts of Egypt,especially Heliopolis and Memphis, which had been preserved since timeimmemorial in the temple-libraries of the ancient Egyptians. Also literary worksof philosophy, religion, science and the arts were imported from other parts ofthe world, especially Greece. Ptolemy I Soter, moreover, took a great personalinterest in having brought to him a copy of the Old Testament of the Hebrewsand, for the first time ever, had the latter translated into Greek, making itavailable to the non-Jewish world. Thus an incredible intellectual and spiritualvortex began to swirl in Alexandria, and the result would be the creation of aneven more powerful magical religious philosophy which was to be attributed toHermes Trismegistus, the name given to the Egyptian wisdom god, Thoth, by theGraeco-Egyptian population of Alexandria.Over the coming centuries, as we shall see, the ancient Egyptian magicaltradition was to dress itself in Greek garb and subliminally inject itself intoWestern Europe.METAMORPHOSISIn 586 BC, the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar II, captured Jerusalem causing amass expulsion of Jews, many of whom found their way into Egypt. Evidence of aJewish presence in Egypt in those times is widespread from the Nile Delta areain the north to the distant south at Elephantine near Aswan. Also two centurieslater, when Ptolemy I Soter took control of Palestine and Jerusalem, he broughtback Jewish mercenaries and encouraged Jews to settle in his newly founded cityof Alexandria. By the first century BC and the reign of the fabled Cleopatra,last of the Ptolemaic rulers, a large segment of the population of Alexandriawas made up of Jews who had adopted Greek language and customs. And there can beno doubt that it was with the Jews of Egypt that a patriarchal monotheisticreligion that abhorred idols and graven images began to take hold in the ancientland of the pharaohs.In 30 BC the Roman legions of Octavian (the future Emperor Augustus) reached thegates of Alexandria to challenge his arch-rival, Mark Antony. Inside thevirtually defenceless city there was panic and pandemonium. The armed forcescommanded by Antony and Cleopatra had been decisively defeated at the navalBattle of Actium and now any resistance to Octavian would simply be foolishbravado. Indeed, earlier Mark Antony, in a moment of heroic folly, had attempteda valiant charge against Octavian's Roman legions only to find himself desertedby his own men who hailed Octavian as their true leader. Thus abandoned butstill unable to face defeat, Mark Antony committed suicide, begging the last ofhis loyal soldiers to finish him off. When the news reached Cleopatra, shebecame determined not to be captured alive by Octavian, and committed the mostfamous suicide in history by being bitten by a deadly asp.Thus 3,000 years of pharaonic civilisation came abruptly to an end. Octavianimmediately declared Egypt to be a province of Rome, and the might of theCaesars fell on this ancient and sacred land like a gigantic sledgehammer.Within years Egypt was reduced to nothing more than a granary to feed Rome'slegions.Alarmed at changes they saw being introduced all around them, what the Egyptianpriests undoubtedly feared most was the extinction of their magical religion.Throughout the three centuries of Ptolemaic rule, the ancient Egyptiantemple-cult had not only survived but had received active state sponsorship andhad boomed everywhere. This was because its timehonoured antiquity had apowerful, almost enchanting appeal for the Ptolemies who found that it meshedperfectly with their own mythologies and ideas of the divine. Indeed, theancient Egyptian magical religion was seen as a boon for the universal dream ofthe Ptolemies and, like many other things, fitted the city of Alexandria likeCinderella's slipper. The Romans, on the other hand, saw the connection simplyas another source of political power to run Egypt and its resources efficiently.It is true, of course, that Roman emperors appointed themselves as ‘pharaohs’and even adopted the religion of Serapis and Isis. They also restored templesand built new ones in honour of the Egyptian deities – the famous Temple ofDendera was restored to its present-day appearance by Emperor Tiberius.60[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en845] None of this, however won over theEgyptians let alone the Egyptian priests. They knew that under the Romans,things would inevitably be very different. The enlightened Ptolemies sawthemselves as successors to the Egyptian pharaonic tradition, whereas the Romanshad come as conquerors and masters. As the Coptic scholar Dr. Jill Kamil pointsout:The institution of sacrosanct monarchy, a cardinal feature of Egyptian life inpharaonic times which had been maintained by various later dynasties (thePtolemies, for example), was lost in Roman times. The emperors may have claimedto be divine but it was their prefects who ruled Egypt, reduced the prestige ofthe priests, and exerted pressure on the people. They siphoned off the wealth ofthe land to Rome and recruited Egyptians to fight Roman wars in other countries.The Egyptians, who had accepted Ptolemaic rule, resisted Roman. It is notdifficult to see the difference between them. Under the Ptolemies, Egypt hadretained its integrity and had a stable economy. Under the Romans the countrywas shorn of identity and impoverished. It was no more than a private estate forthe emperor and a pleasure-ground for the Roman upper classes.61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en846]There was at first some semblance of prosperity and even a sense of protectionunder the Romans,62 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en847] but on thewhole it did not benefit the Egyptians themselves. The wealth extracted fromagriculture fed the Roman garrisons and filled the treasury of Rome; and if anynew temple or hydraulic project was built by the Romans it was done forstrategic reasons and to strengthen their political and military hold on Egypt.Soon the Egyptians – now a people mixed with ‘Egyptian’ Greeks and Jews – beganto revolt. In AD 115 a huge revolt, apparently led by the Jews, was brutallycrushed by the Romans. Another massacre was to take place in Alexandria duringthe visit of the mad Emperor Caracalla in AD 215, after he was accused by therash Alexandrians of his brother's assassination. And an even more seriousrevolt took place in AD 297, this time firmly put down by Emperor Diocletian whorecaptured Alexandria after a siege of eight months.But not all imperial visits were aggressive. There was the time when EmperorVespasian had come to Alexandria and, like Alexander the Great before him, wasproclaimed ‘son of Amun’ and even the ‘reincarnation’ of Serapis. So seriouslydid Vespasian take this that he apparently went through the streets ofAlexandria performing ‘miracles’, and on one occasion restored the sight to ablind man.63 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en848]Then there had been the relatively peaceful visit of Emperor Hadrian toAlexandria and to Thebes in Upper Egypt in AD 130. Whilst in Egypt Hadrian'sfavourite companion and lover, a youth called Antinous, drowned in the Nilewhereupon Hadrian promptly ordered that a city be founded near the tragic spotto be called Antinoupolis. Hadrian also left us an observation of very greatvalue concerning the worship of Christ and of Serapis in Alexandria when hewrote as follows to Servianus, the governor of the city:So you praise Egypt, my very dear Servianus! I know the land from top to bottom… In it the worshippers of Serapis are Christians, and those who call themselvesBishops of Christ pay their vows to Serapis … Whenever the patriarch himselfcomes to Egypt he is made to worship Serapis by some and Christ by others.64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en849]Amid such alarming religious syncretism, and constantly threatened by thetemperamental debaucheries and cruelty of the Roman emperors, the Egyptianpriesthood must have paused to reflect. So far they had succeeded, beyond theirwildest dreams, in ensuring the survival of their age-old magical religion byaccommodating and converting the Ptolemies. Now, however, they saw the Romans asa much more serious and perhaps even insurmountable danger. When the Romans hadarrived in Egypt in AD 30 an intellectual and literary osmosis had long takenplace between the Greeks and the educated Egyptians, many of whom were priests,scribes and functionaries associated with the temple-cult. As Dr. Kamilexplains:The languages in official use in Egypt were Greek and Egyptian, Greek being themore widely used. Egyptian literates had learned Greek long before the conquestof Alexander. They also realised that if they transcribed their own language inthe Greek alphabet, which was well known among the middle classes and wassimpler to read than demotic (the cursive form of hieroglyphic writing in itslatest development), communication would be easier. Scribes started translatingEgyptian sounds in Greek, adding seven extra letters from the demotic alphabetto accommodate the sounds from which there were no Greek letters. The emergenceof this new script, [is] now known as Coptic …65[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en850]There had been much encouragement in the exchange of ideas and written works,and the first Ptolemies, such as Soter and Philadelphus, would actually issuedecrees that important Egyptian writings from the temple libraries should betranslated into Greek, the lingua franca of Egypt and its neighbours.66[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en851] As noted above, tradition has itthat Ptolemy I Soter also commissioned 72 erudite Jewish scholars to translatethe Old Testament into Greek, a version now known as the Septuagint which was toserve as the basis for future Latin translations.Not surprisingly a very powerful spiritual and intellectual mutation began tooccur in Alexandria which ended up producing a ‘neo-Egyptian’ wisdom philosophythat was readily embraced by the cosmopolitan inhabitants. One element of thiswas Christian Gnosticism, which we have examined at length in Part I, and whichis represented most strongly today in the surviving Nag Hammadi texts. Another,closely linked but with its own distinct character, was the ‘pagan’ Hermeticliterature we've explored in Chapters Eight and Nine. Also compiled inAlexandria in the first three centuries AD, it is these Hermetic texts, claimsJill Kamil, that most perfectly sum up the intellectual and spiritual yearningsof the period:Although, therefore, Egypt was ruled by a Greek speaking elite, and the bulk ofthe population was largely illiterate, there was a bilingual community that wasmultinational. This is nowhere more clearly demonstrated than in a collection ofsyncretistic treatises known as the Corpus Hermeticum. The corpus waspurportedly written by Thoth, the ancient Egyptian god of wisdom who, under hisGreek name Hermes Trismegistus, gave the compilation its name. The Hermetictexts, some composed in Greek, some translated from Egyptian into Greek, were ablend of semi-philosophical treatises on the divine, ancient Egyptian wisdom andliterature, and esoteric teachings including cosmological conceptions andmysticism. Through such literature, one can best appreciate the varied andsubtle ways in which the consciousness of the divine manifested itself among thewhole cultural amalgam in Egypt.67 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en852]In the Chapter Eight we saw the effects of this strange and mysterious Hermeticliterature after it burst upon the European scene in 1460. Let us now place itat its origins into is proper intellectual and cultural setting alongside theemergent force of Christianity in both its Gnostic and its ‘literalist’ forms.THE THREE MAJOR PLAYERSAround the year AD 30, some sixty years after Octavian invaded Egypt, it isclaimed that a man called Jesus from the town of Nazareth was crucified inJerusalem. This claim – that Christ was indeed man as well as god – is centralto the doctrine of Roman Catholicism. On the other hand the reader will recallfrom Part I that the Gnostics held an entirely different view which did notadmit the physical incarnation of Christ. Who is to say, at this remove of 2,000years, which side was right and which was wrong, whether or not Christ was aman, or an apparition, or ever existed at all? Christianity exists, of thatthere is no doubt. It has shaped the world we live in. But Christ himself stillproves elusive and nothing about the story of his life and death, or even aboutwhat happened to his followers during the first 30 or so years after his death,can honestly be said be to confirmed as solid historical fact.Tradition has it Saint Mark went to Rome and in that city wrote his famous‘Gospel’. Then, during the reign of Emperor Nero at about AD 60, he left Romeand travelled to Alexandria on his apostolic mission to convert the Egyptians.The great persecution of the Christians had already begun in Rome under Nero,and thus Egypt was not only a safer place to be but, and perhaps more important,was ripe for such a mission to succeed. And succeed it did, well beyond thewildest of Saint Mark's expectations.According to Egyptian-Coptic tradition the first person in Egypt to be convertedto Christianity by Saint Mark was a Jewish shoemaker from Alexandria. Whetherthis is historically true or not is unimportant, but it does emphasise the factthat the large Jewish population of Alexandria would have been an obvious targetfor such conversion to a new Judeo-Messianic cult. It is possible, indeed veryprobable, that some of the early followers of Jesus – whoever this mysteriousfigure really was! – found refuge in Egypt and formed the first nucleus ofproto-Christian adepts in Egypt. Conversion thus naturally began within theexisting Jewish population and then gradually spread to the indigenous as wellas to the Graeco-Roman populations.This process, almost organic in its progress, had the inevitable effect ofproducing a variety of religious factions in Alexandria. Right from the outsettwo key players were the Christian Gnostics on the one hand, who frequentlyinterpreted the scriptures symbolically and allegorically, and ‘literalist’Christians on the other who interpreted the scriptures literally. We haveconsidered both at length in Part I.A third major player resisted the Christian tide and remained ‘pagan’, retainingmany original ancient Egyptian beliefs but now expressed in Greek, with ritualsstructured for Greek-speaking adepts. These were the Hermetists – so called, aswe know, because they followed the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, the alterego of the ancient Egyptian wisdom god Thoth. Vilified and hated by the CatholicChurch, the Gnostics and Hermetists found in each other a common bond – thisbeing the search for salvation and spiritual illumination through divineknowledge, that is to say through gnosis. And although the Gnostics werelabelled ‘heretics’ by the Church and the Hermetists were branded as ‘pagans’,both were perceived as equally dangerous enemies and were, accordingly,persecuted with equal ferocity.We've seen in Chapter Five how the persecution reached a point in the latefourth century AD when the Christian Emperor Theodosius closed all the ‘pagan’temples in Egypt. Gnostics and pagans alike were hounded into the desert andtheir places of worship either destroyed or ‘converted’ into Catholic churches,while their books were seized and burnt. It seems, however, that both groups hadpreviously taken precautions to ensure that their sacred texts and ancienttraditions would not be completely erased.We followed the story of Gnosticism in Part I and how it survived as a livingtradition until the destruction of the Cathars and the Bogomils in the 13th and14th centuries. We also reported the story of the Nag Hammadi Gnostic texts inPart I, their loss to the world for sixteen centuries, their miraculous recoveryin 1945, and their implications for our understanding of Christianity.The Hermetic texts, the so-called writings of Hermes Trismegistus, came to lightrather sooner. Copies had been smuggled out of Egypt, probably during the fifthor sixth century AD, with some reaching Byzanthium and Macedonia. One completecollection would pass from hand to hand, albeit recopied several times butnonetheless remaining essentially the same for a thousand years until, as wedescribed in Chapter Eight, an aging Italian monk found it, recognised it forwhat it was, and brought it to Cosimo de’Medici.The man of his epoch best suited to respond to such a discovery, Cosimo's earlysponsorship launched the Hermetic message on a glittering Renaissance careerthat saw it infiltrate its symbolism into the very apartments of the pope beforethe end of the 15th century. Where Christian Gnosticism had been utterly crushedin Occitania after its re-emergence as Catharism, is it possible that the‘pagan’ branch of the Alexandrian gnosis – i.e. Hermeticism – was about tosucceed in overthrowing the hated tyranny of the Catholic Church?"},{"pageContent":"In the later part of the 16th century, in a Europe devastated by the awful warsand persecutions arising from the conflict between Reformation and Catholicreaction … men turned to the Hermetic religion of the world to take them abovethese conflicts …Frances Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition Perchance your fear in passing judgement on me is greater than mine in receivingit…Response of Giordano Bruno to the cardinals of the Inquisition after theysentenced him to be burnt at the stake.

But after the heretics had been crushed the pressurewas off and by the 16th century the reputation of the Vatican had once againbecome severely tarnished. Not only were there the ongoing excesses and horrorsof the Inquisition – which was passing through a phase of renewed frenzy. Alsothere had been the numerous scandals of the ‘bad popes’. Amongst these, as wesaw in Chapter Eight, the Borgia Pope Alexander VI stands out for his bizarrebehaviour, not to mention the intrigue and homicidal cruelty of his twochildren, Cesare and Lucretia Borgia, and the wild parties and orgies that tookplace at the Vatican.All this debauchery began to cause many in Europe to doubt the papacy. Suchdoubt first led to derision, then cautious protestation and finally to openrevolt by ‘Protestant’ groups outside Italy. The main thrust of the movement wasspearheaded in Germany by a country pastor, Martin Luther, in a bold bid towrangle Christianity away from the clutches of the papacy in Rome.Awful carnage ensued where Catholic and Protestant armies battled for decades.By the second half of the 16th century many were utterly sickened by theterrible bloodshed and destruction and had began to hope for a saviour orchampion who could unite Europe again in peace and prosperity. In the year 1569all eyes fell on the Bourbon family in the kingdom of Navarre, and on Francewhere the religious crisis between Catholics and Protestants (known asHuguenots) was reaching a turning point.THE RISE AND RISE OF CATHERINE DE’MEDICIAt the head of the military Catholic League in 1569 was the French king, CharlesIX, but in reality much of the power of this rather sickly and weak monarch wasvested in his ambitious and domineering mother, Catherine de’Medici. Born intothe powerful and influential Florentine family in 1519, Catherine's parents wereLorenzo de’Medici, the Duke of Urbino, and Madeleine de la Tour d’Auvergne, thelatter linked to the French royal family. Orphaned at a very young age,Catherine was once kept as hostage when the Medici Palace was attacked andoccupied by an angry mob of Florentines who revolted against the papacy. Finelyeducated in convents around the city during the siege of Florence, she was atlast set free and taken to Rome after her warring uncle, Pope Clement VII(Giulio de’Medici), crushed the rebellion in Florence. The pope then negotiatedwith King Francis I of France for Catherine – at that time just 14-years-old –to marry the king's second eldest son, Henry of Orléans.Wanting to make a suitable impression on the French court to counter her rathershort stature and not-too-pretty countenance, the youthful Catherine de’Mediciconsulted a Florentine artisan who presented her with the very first example ofa pair of modern high-heeled shoes, which caused quite a stir when she arrived.Immediately disliked by the French, she nonetheless became their queen when theeldest son of Francis I died, leaving the throne to her husband, Henry ofOrléans, who was crowned as Henry II. Henry, meanwhile, had been having apassionate affair with Diane de Poitiers, a ravishingly beautiful courtesan 20years his senior. But in spite of this, Catherine de’Medici bore him no lessthan ten children; three died at birth; three others were destined to becomekings of France: Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III.Henry II’s hatred for the Protestant Huguenots of France and the violentrepression that he imposed on them, finally led to an all out civil war. He wasto die from a horrible jousting accident in 1559. It was then that Catherinede’Medici started a long reign of co-regency with her sons; first with FrancisII, who died a year later in 1560, then with her second son Charles IX, who diedin 1574, and finally with Henry III who died in August 1589, just a few monthsafter Catherine's own death in January of that same year.At first Catherine had oscillated between Huguenots and Catholics in an attemptto bring peace to France, and she even went as far as to arrange a marriagebetween her daughter, Marguerite, and Henry of Navarre, the dashing ProtestantBourbon prince, the future Henry IV of France. The kingdom of Navarre, which wassituated in northern Spain, was ruled by a rogue French dynasty, the Bourbons,who bitterly opposed the Catholic League. Henry's mother, Jeanne d’Albret, thequeen of Navarre, was a staunch Protestant and saw to it that her son alsofollowed suit. Trained in military skills by Gaspard de Coligny, an ableProtestant general of Navarre, Henry of Navarre proved to be a natural militarystrategist who excelled at hand-to-hand combat, starting at the young age of 16when he personally led the first cavalry charge of the Huguenots against theCatholics at the Battle of Arnay-le-duc. Finally, in 1570, a precarious peacetreaty was signed by Catherine de’Medici, queen of France, and Jeanne d’Albret,queen of Navarre, and a marriage was proposed between Catherine's daughter,Marguerite de’Medici, and Jeanne's heroic son, Henry of Navarre. After lengthynegotiations between the two rival queens, an agreement was reached in 1572 andthe marriage ceremony was planned to take place in Paris. Upon arrival in Parisin June, however, the queen of Navarre suddenly died of a lung infection and, inconsequence, her son Henry became the new king of Navarre. He and Margueritede’Medici married on 18 August 1572 but Henry refused to attend Catholic Massafter the wedding with the French royal family. And barely a few days later, oneof history's most gruesome ‘days of infamy’ was to crush all hopes of peacebetween the Protestant Huguenots and the Catholics in France.THE ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S DAY MASSACREDuring the royal wedding of Henry and Marguerite, thousands of Huguenots,including Henry's famous cousin, the Prince of Condé, had poured into Paris forthe celebrations. Rumours began to spread of a plot against Catherine de’Medici,who urged her frail and weak-minded son, Charles IX, to act swiftly and harshlyagainst the Huguenots. There followed an attempt to assassinate the Prince ofCondé which sparked a huge riot against Catherine; in return the royal guardswere ordered to attack the unprepared Huguenots. A terrible massacre ensued, andthe streets of Paris, it was later said, were knee-deep in blood. This gruesomegenocide has gone down in history as the ‘St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre’because it took place on 24 August, the festival of that saint.Against the background of such charged events, Henry of Navarre found himselfeffectively a prisoner of the most Catholic French royal family into which hehad married. In a bid to save his own life as well as the Protestant cause, hepretended to abandon Protestantism. After convincing the crafty Catherinede’Medici that he had sincerely converted to Catholicism, Henry finally escapedthree years later to his kingdom in Navarre to raise an army against theCatholics.Meanwhile Charles IX died and was succeeded by Henry III, Catherine's last andfavourite son. Aloof and apparently fond of young men known as the mignons, aquaint French word for homosexuals, Henry III spent much of his time inquestionable pastimes which included dressing up as a woman, taking part inmacabre processions around Paris wearing a sinister monk's cloak and cagoul, andjoining a group of Capuchin friars who impersonated the ‘Virgin Mary’ and ‘MariaMagdalena’ while a third, perhaps the king himself, impersonated ‘Jesus’.1[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en853] Additionally Henry was the patronof two religious military orders – the ‘Knights of the Holy Spirit’ and ‘Knightsof the Phoenix’ – which were reported to have conducted unusual ritualsinvolving the king.2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en854]With no marriage or heirs in sight, Henry III seemed destined to be the last ofthe powerful Orléans-Medici dynasty to rule France. Attention fell on hisdashing renegade brother-in-law, Henry of Navarre who was the next in line tothe throne of France. And many began to see in him the god-sent king who wouldunite Protestants and Catholics once again.A MASS FOR PARISIn 1586 Henry of Navarre set up his military headquarters at La Rochelle,traditionally a strong fortress city and symbol of Protestant resistance. Fromthere he would oppose the powerful Catholic League formed by an unholy allianceof Spain, France, the Vatican and the Hapsburgs in Germany, the latter thetraditional seat of the Holy Roman Empire. In the fall of 1587, Henry of Navarreconfronted the Catholic army of Henry III of France at Coutras, near Bordeaux.Henry III’s army was led by one of Henry III’s mignons, the Duke of Joyeuse, whowas no match for Henry of Navarre. The Catholics were crushed and the Duke ofJoyeuse was killed in action.Not unexpectedly, Henry of Navarre was immediately condemned as a heretic by thepope and declared unfit to succeed to the throne of France. Philip II of Spain,unquestionably the real power behind the Catholic League, then proposed that hisdaughter, Isabella, should become queen of France. Bullied by the immenselypowerful Count of Guise, a staunch Catholic, Henry III fled Paris, and theCatholic League took over.Henry III struck a secret deal with Henry of Navarre and promised him thesuccession to the throne if he would help him recapture Paris. The next move wasthe assassination of the Count of Guise by Henry III’s mignons on 23 December1588. He and Henry of Navarre then laid siege to Paris in early 1589. In themidst of this crisis, however, Henry III was himself knifed by a fanaticalJesuit monk, Jacques Clément. On his deathbed, coughing blood from his lungwounds, Henry apparently managed to master enough strength to proclaim Henry ofNavarre his legitimate successor.The Catholic League refused Henry of Navarre entry into Paris and the crown ofFrance unless he would attend a Catholic Mass. It was then that Henryimmortalised the phrase, ‘Paris is well worth a Mass!’ and once again abjuredProtestantism in the name of expediency. Henry of Navarre was crowned King HenryIV of France at Chartres Cathedral in 1594 and, on 22 March, the spring equinox,rode into Paris on his celebrated white steed amid huge cheers and jubilations.THE HERMETIC MISSION OF GIORDANO BRUNOIt will be clear from the brief sketch given above that the religious strugglewhich most concerned the Catholic Church during the 16th century was its fightagainst Protestantism. The Cathar wars were a thing of the past, dualist heresywas dead and buried, and although the Protestants were ‘heretics’ they werenothing like as heretical as the Cathars had been 400 years before. Indeed,apart from a shared anti-materialism, the Cathar religion had no more in commonwith Protestantism than it did with Catholicism and belonged, as we have seen,to the tradition of Gnostic Christianity that took shape in Alexandria in thefirst three centuries AD.Out of the same Alexandrian melting-pot, in the same period, emerged a secondtradition that also claimed to pass on a sacred soul-freeing gnosis. We've seenin previous chapters that the name of this second tradition was Hermeticism –after Hermes Trismegistus – and that the Church regarded it as ‘pagan’ ratherthan Christian. Unlike the Gnostic tradition, which we suggest survived in avirtually unbroken chain of heresy from the early Christian period until thecrushing of the Cathars, the continued survival of Hermeticism from the 5th tothe 15th centuries is much harder to attest.3[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en855] What brings this ancient traditionto life again, at least in the West, seems purely and simply to be the recoveryof its primary texts, their translation at the Medici Academy in the 1460s, andthe subsequent international ‘movement’ that the texts inspired. It may be thecase, however, that there was more than immediately meets the eye to thephenomenal success of this revived Hermeticism. The sheer speed with which ittook off and the way in which it so rapidly managed to work its way into theheart of the Vatican, as we reported in Chapter Eight, are hard to explain. Itis almost as though some sort of system or ‘organisation’ was already in placewhen the texts resurfaced that had both the will and the capacity to exploittheir full potential for undermining the established Church.If so Giordano Bruno, perhaps the greatest Hermetic magus of the 16th century,is likely to have been part of the plot (though he may have possibly have beentoo stubborn and independent a thinker to have plotted efficiently!). Born in1548 at the little town of Nola near Naples he was burnt agonisingly to deathover a slow fire by the Inquisition in 1600 for having spent the previous 21years trying to destroy Catholic Christianity …The reader will recall that the majority of papal inquisitors were Dominicans.Ironically, as a young man, Bruno himself had been a Dominican monk, at theirmonastery in Naples. It was a foretaste of what was to come that even at thisearly stage he was accused of heresy by his fellow monks. His crime was to havebeen caught reading the banned works of Erasmus and those of Marcilio Ficino andGiovanni Pico della Mirandola expounding the Hermetic tradition.Bruno's stubborn attitude and fierce free will were not assets for thecontrolled life at the monastery. In 1576, when he was 28 years old, he finallyended up repudiating this oppressive religious order and emotionally defrockedhimself in public. Learning that the Inquisition was preparing an indictmentagainst him (which consisted of no less than 130 separate charges of heresy!) hethen wisely went on the run.4 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en856]Impulsive, argumentative, brilliant – indeed a genius – Bruno was an all-outHermetist who harboured wild dreams of the full restoration of the ‘Egyptian’religion of Hermes Trismegistus. But unlike Pico della Mirandola's rather feebleattempt to integrate Hermeticism with Christianity through the Cabala (seeChapter Eight) Bruno had something much more radical in mind: the actualreplacement of Christianity by the Hermetic magical religion of Egypt.BRUNO'S TRAVELSAfter fleeing the Inquisition in 1576 Bruno turned up in quick succession inGenoa, Turin, Savona and Noli. In 1577 he spent a few weeks in Venice where hepublished his first book, unfortunately now lost, under the title Dei segni deitempi (‘Signs of the Times’). His next stop was Padua and after that Milan wherehe first heard of an English nobleman, Sir Philip Sydney, who would later cometo play an important role in his life.5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en857]In 1578 Bruno travelled to Geneva, where he hoped to win the protection of theMarquis of Vico, a wealthy and influential Italian Protestant living in exile.Bruno made it clear that he did not want to adopt Protestantism himself, only tolive and work quietly, but the authorities would not permit him to do so. Hefell into a slanging-match with an eminent professor of Geneva, was arrested forhis temerity and forced to apologise. Soon afterwards he left the city indisgust.6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en858]From 1579 – 1581 Bruno lived in Toulouse, capital of the former Cathar domain ofOccitania and now fully integrated into France. He took his doctorate intheology at the University of Toulouse and was subsequently appointed to a chairin philosophy there. Once again, however, his instinctive nonconformism andoutspokenness led him into conflicts with other scholars and with his students.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en859]In 1581 Bruno sought refuge in Paris where he delivered a series of 30 lecturesthat were reportedly widely admired. He quickly began to acquire a reputationfor his ‘enormous erudition, prodigious memory, and eloquence.’8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en860]BRUNO AT THE FRENCH COURTIn 1582 Bruno was summoned to the French court by the slightly unhinged HenryIII who was then at the apogee of his doomed reign. Bruno, it seems, was atfirst very well received by the king, and in due course was given a position atthe Collège de France to teach the art of memory and mnemonics.9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en861] In Bruno's own words:I gained such a name that King Henry III summoned me one day and asked mewhether the memory which I had and which I taught was a natural memory orobtained by magic art; I proved to him that it was not obtained by magic art butby science. After that I printed a book on memory entitled De Umbris Idearum[‘The Shadow of Ideas’] which I dedicated to his majesty, whereupon he made mean endowed reader.10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en862]That the art of memory had nothing to do with magic is, strictly speaking, nottrue; and Bruno knew this.11 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en863] Buthe made the statement quoted above during his trial by the Inquisition in 1600,and thus would have been most reluctant to admit to using pagan magic in histeachings. Nevertheless the cultivation of a powerful memory, and morespecifically the kind of super-memory that Bruno had mastered through the art ofmnemonics, was indeed very much part of the system of magic that was oncepracticed by the ancient Egyptians and divulged in the Hermetic writings. AsFrances Yates comments:Bruno's relations with Henry III are only documented from what Bruno himselftold the Inquisitors … If Henry looked at the De Umbris Idearum [the book Brunodedicated to him] he would certainly have recognised its magic images … at onetime the king sent to Spain for magic books … one of which was the Picatrix. Itis also incredible in view of his mother's addiction to magicians andastrologers [Catherine had, after all, been a member of the Medici elite inFlorence], that Henry should not have known a good deal about magic. The moreprobable version of the story would be that Henry was attracted by the rumourabout magic in connection with Bruno, and this was why he sent for him.12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en864]Images, especially images of stars and other celestial objects such as the Sun,planets and the zodiac, in short all the symbols of astral magic found in theHermetica's Asclepius and in the Picatrix (see discussion in Chapter Eight),were indeed used by Bruno as powerful memory devices. To speak more technically,they served for him as ‘talismans’ by means of which memories could bepermanently imprinted on the mind.13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en865] Also incorporated into Bruno'smagical art of memory was to be found the new and still very controversialtheory of the great astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus with itsSun-centred/heliocentric dynamics so abhorred by the Catholic Church at thetime. Bruno, in fact, saw himself as a disciple of Copernicus; but being Bruno,he wanted to go even further than the shy Polish man by boldly proclaiming thatthe universe was infinite and made up of infinite number of suns, i.e. thestars, each having planetary systems populated by living creatures just like ourown planet. And thus Bruno, through his remarkable intuition, can be said tohave anticipated by nearly four centuries our modern ideas of the cosmos.14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en866]Copernicus's theory, by correctly placing the Sun rather than the Earth at thecentre of our own planetary system was understood by Bruno as evidence of divineharmony and universal unity, in which all the planets were governed by a centralauthority. Seen through the complex and symbolically-inclined mind of Bruno, theheliocentric system, brought down to earth by the power of astral magic,provided the model for the ideal society. Such a society would of course beruled by a great ‘solar monarch’, advised by philosopher-priests, whose reignwould usher in the magical Hermetic religion around which all the nations of theworld would unite. To Bruno's way of thinking the French, or perhaps even theEnglish in the person of their illustrious Queen Elizabeth I, might prove to bethe source of such a benign and charismatic ruler.Thus it was, after sojourning a year at the French court, that Bruno travelledto England in March 1583. His purpose, as discerned by the Baron Cobham, Englishambassador to Paris at the time, was to promote a ‘religion I cannot commend’.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en867] Or as Frances Yates puts it:Giordano Bruno, Hermetic magician of a most extreme type, [was] now about topass into England to expound his ‘new philosophy’.16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en868]BRUNO IN LONDON AND OXFORDBruno was to spend two very active years in England during which he convertedhis life ‘from that of a wandering magician into that of a very strange kind ofmissionary indeed.’ 17 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en869] He took upresidence in London at the house of the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau,Sieur de la Mauvissière, having earlier been introduced to him by the king ofFrance, Henry III.No sooner had Bruno settled in his new home than he began to write in earnest.His first publication was a book on the art of memory dedicated to his host, theFrench ambassador. Bruno was hoping that, as in France, his special knowledge ofthis ‘magical art’ would attract the attention of scholars, perhaps even thefavour of the court, and obtain for him a scholarship at Oxford.He was, however, soon to be disappointed. In June 1583, just a few months afterhis arrival in England, Bruno somehow found his way into a debate with a groupof Oxford scholars during an evening organised for the entertainment of PrinceAlbert Laski of Poland. Bruno delivered a lecture on ‘the immortality of thesoul’ and on his personal vision of the Copernican theory but was heckled andinterrupted by an elderly Oxford gentleman. ‘Learn how roughly and rudely thatpig behaved,’ Bruno commented later:… and with what patience and humanity the Nolan [Bruno] replied, showing himselfto be indeed a Neapolitan, born and bred beneath a kindlier sky. Hear how they[the Oxford dons] made him leave off his public lectures on the immortality ofthe soul and on the quintuple sphere.18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en870]Bruno (who liked to be known as ‘the Nolan’ after Nola, his place of birth) hada deep aversion for narrow-minded scholars like those he encountered at Oxford.He called them ‘Grammarians’, ‘Aristotelians’ (Aristotle, unlike his masterPlato, had long been a favoured philosopher of the Catholic Church) and‘pedants’. Rather than seeking divine truth, he complained, they quibbled andendlessly debated with each other over trivialities. Worse, there was many ascholar of this type who ‘understood but did not dare to say what he understood[and] … saw but did not believe what he saw’.19[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en871] In Bruno's view, all such were tobe pitied for their inability to develop deeper insight or to grasp theimportance of the intuitive faculty that the ancients had once harnessed withtheir ‘profound magic’.At the heart of Bruno's attack on his fellow scholars was the view that theirtitles and positions merely served to disguise their fundamental emptiness. Theywere quite the opposite of the Gnostic and Hermetic sages of antiquity whosesearch for knowledge and truth had not depended solely upon the analysis andobservation of nature. Those remote figures, Bruno knew, had reliedadditionally, and especially, on deeper insights that could be reached only byintuition harnessed through natural magic – in the manner of the high initiatesof ancient Egypt.None of this means that Bruno condemned analytical or mathematical science;quite the contrary, as his support for Copernicus proves. Indeed, Bruno wasamong the very first to speak openly at Oxford on the heliocentric theory ofCopernicus. But with a major difference. Unlike others scholars, the Nolaninsisted on placing the theory within ‘the context of the astral magic andsun-worship’ that was evident in the Hermetic texts, as well as extending it tosupport his own cosmological vision of an infinite universe with numberlessinhabited worlds .20 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en872] It wasbecause the stiff Oxonians of the 16th century were not ready for suchcutting-edge ways of thinking that they treated Bruno insultingly and forced himto abandon in midstream his lecture on the immortality of the soul.SIDNEY AND DEEPresent that day was the young and influential English statesman, Sir PhilipSidney, who had come on the command of Queen Elizabeth I to escort the Polishnobleman, Prince Albert Laski, to the debate. The queen had high regard forSidney, and it was no secret that his uncle, the debonair Earl of Leicester, SirRobert Dudley, had once been Elizabeth's favourite and, according to some, evenher secret lover.Philip Sidney was a refined scholar and poet and would, almost certainly, havebeen familiar with the Hermetic texts, which by this time had been circulatingin Europe for more than a century. A great patron of scholars and artists Sidneyis credited with ushering in the age of Elizabethan poetry with his acclaimedsonnet sequence ‘Astrophel and Stella’. This he composed as the result of hispassionate love for Penelope Devereux, the beautiful young wife of Lord Rich.Sidney was also well acquainted with the famous court astrologer and ‘magician’,Dr. John Dee – although the extent and depth of this connection is unclear.Dee was a genuine mathematician, but had also previously served as astrologer toMary Tudor. She had ended up accusing him of practicing evil magic on her andhad imprisoned him at Hampton Court. Dee was released in 1555 and later resumedhis work as official astrologer and magician at the court of Elizabeth I – fromwhose royal support, favour and protection he was fortunate to benefit. It wasJohn Dee in his role as astrologer who advised the court on the most favourabledate for Elizabeth's coronation.Dee seems to have been an alchemist, cabalist, astronomer, astrologer andmathematician all rolled into one, but is remembered mostly as a ‘conjuror’ and‘magician’. He believed, with utter conviction, that he could communicate withthe spiritual world and ‘angels’ through crystals. To further his work in thisarea he employed a certain Edward Kelly, a clairvoyant with a rather dubiouspast, to assist him.At the time Bruno arrived in England, Dee was preparing to travel to Poland andBohemia to give séances and exhibitions of his conjuring at the courts ofvarious princes. We shall see in a later chapter how this magical mystery tourof Dee's was to be among the catalysts that led to the formation a secretivemovement known as Rosicrucianism. Not unlike Bruno, the Rosicrucians made use ofHermetic magic and the Cabala as tools for religious reform.THE EXPULSION OF THE TRIUMPHANT BEASTAlthough Bruno did not meet Dee, he did know Philip Sidney, a fact which isattested by Bruno himself in the dedication of his most important book, Spacciodella Bestia Trionfante (‘The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast’), published in1584.The peculiar and striking title of this work is to be understood on at least twolevels. First, as Bruno also states in his dedication to Sidney, ‘driving out ofthe triumphant beast’ is a metaphor for driving out ‘the vices whichpredominate, and oppose the divine part of the soul.’21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en873] What this calls to mind issomething closely akin to the Gnostic/Cathar/Manichean vision of the soulimprisoned in the world of matter and ever more deeply entrapped by surrender tothe fleshly vices. But at the second level of meaning the ‘triumphant beast’ isunquestionably the pope, and with him the entire established structure ofCatholic Christianity. At this level the ‘expulsion’ envisaged by Bruno is tomake way for his ‘Egyptianism as a religion’22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en874] based on the teachings of HermesTrismegistus:It is the good religion which was overwhelmed in darkness when the Christiansdestroyed it, forbade it by statutes, substituted worship of dead things,foolish rites, bad moral behaviour and constant wars.23[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en875]One of the very peculiar and distinctive aspects of the religious revolutionproposed in the Spaccio, notes Frances Yates, and one clearly attributable tothe influence on Bruno of the Hermetic texts:Is that it begins in the heavens; it is the images of the constellations of thezodiac and of the northern and southern constellations which are reformed orcleansed through a council of the planetary gods … 24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en876]The Spaccio, in short, is a treatise on Hermetic astral magic, filled withreferences to the stars, the zodiac and the constellations, that goes to greatlengths to explain how their powers can be brought down and vested in earthlythings through ‘the magic and divine cult of the Egyptians.’25[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en877] Bruno's intention was clearenough. He wanted to show that Egyptian wisdom came earlier than that of theGreeks, and certainly much earlier than that of the Christians and, therefore,must be regarded as ‘the best religion and the best magic and the best laws ofthem all’.26 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en878]Bruno reproduces a passage in the Spaccio from the famous Lament of Hermes. Inthis text, the reader will recall from Chapter Eight, Hermes Trismegistus tellshis pupil Asclepius that the religion of Egypt will fall, and be lost under thehands of invading barbarians, and vanish from the world. But Hermes also saysthat a time will come when it will be restored and accorded a place of honouronce again – and so too does Bruno:The marvellous magical religion of the Egyptians will return, their moral lawswill replace the chaos of the present age, the prophesy of the Lament will befulfilled … 27 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en879]In Bruno's eyes, ‘the sign in heaven proclaiming the return of Egyptian light todispel the present darkness was … the Copernican sun.’28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en880] Accordingly he looked on theCopernican diagram of the concentric orbits of the planets encircling the Sun asa sort of hieroglyph or talisman. It functioned as a magical Hermetic seal thathe, Bruno, thought he understood at its deepest level. He became in consequenceacutely aware of the huge ‘revolution’ which it was about to unleash and of itspotential for inflicting a total upheaval on the dogmas of the Church. Bruno'sstrategy – simple really – was to integrate this inevitable Copernican truththat was about to revolutionise science and religion into his own Hermeticrevolution. He believed that Copernicus had vindicated the Sun-centred system ofthe ancient Egyptians, and that it was now up to the Nolan to revive and restorethat lost faith it in order to reform the world.AS ABOVE SO BELOWWe said above that the great religious reformation envisaged by Bruno, which heexpounded in the Spaccio della Bestia Trionfante, is supposed to begin in theheavens among the stars. Here, a great council of ‘magicians’, including theEgyptian goddess Isis, is convened by Jupiter (Zeus-Amun) in order to reform theimages of the constellations and thus, at the same time, through astral magic,also reform the earthly world below. Such ideas, notes Yates, are clearly pulledfrom the Kore Kosmou (the ‘Virgin of the World’), a well-known Hermetic tract inwhich Isis addresses Horus and another pupil called Momus, and explains to themhow things below on earth must be kept in ‘sympathy’ with things above in heavenin order to avoid chaos and destruction .29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en881] There is a strange and tellingpassage where Hermes reveals to Momus that he, Hermes, plans to invent a ‘secretengine’, or celestial mechanism, a sort of cosmic clockwork regulated by thecogwheels of the planetary orbits, the constellations, the zodiac, the Moon andthe Sun, in order to control events on Earth as well as the lives of men:‘Momus’, said he [Hermes], ‘I will devise a secret engine linked to unerring andinevitable fate, by which all things in men's lives, from their birth to theirfinal destruction, shall by necessity be brought into subjection; and all thingson earth likewise shall be controlled by the working of this engine’ …30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en882]It seems clear that Bruno believed that the great religious reform that manywere dreaming of could, as in the Kore Kosmou, be brought about by Egyptianastral magic or, as Yates was to put it:… [by] manipulating the celestial images on which all things below depend inorder to make the reform come. For in the Spaccio Bruno has Jupiter proclaiming:‘If we thus renew our heaven, the constellations and influences shall be new,the impressions and fortunes shall be new for all things depending on this upperworld.’31 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en883]‘And what’, asks Yates, ‘does this remind us of?’Surely of the magical city of Adocentyn in Picatrix, built by HermesTrismegistus, who placed around the circumference of the city ‘engraved imagesand ordered them in such a manner that by their virtue the inhabitants were madevirtuous and withdrawn from all wickedness and harm.’ This … provides theconnection between Hermes Trismegistus as magician and Hermes Trismegistus aslaw-giver of the Egyptians, who gave them their good moral laws and kept them init. And this, I believe, may be also the connection in the Spaccio between themanipulation or reform of the celestial images and the universal religious andmoral reform.32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en884]In the Picatrix we learn that Hermes built a temple dedicated to the Sun, a sortof Hermetic solar temple if you will. The reader will recall that this solartemple, as well as the magical city of Adocentyn, much resembled anotherHermetic metropolis described in the Asclepius in which:… the gods who exercise their dominion over the earth will be restored one dayand installed in a city at the extreme limit of Egypt, a city which will befounded towards the setting sun, and into which will hasten, by land and sea,the whole race of mortal men …33 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en885]It may be worth noting at this stage that there did once exist two great solartemple-cities at both extreme limits of Egypt, one in the north, which was the‘City of the Sun’ at Heliopolis, and another in the south, the solar city ofKarnak-Luxor at Thebes – which is indeed oriented towards the setting sun. Socould the Hermetic city of the Picatrix somehow have been modelled on ancientThebes? And, more importantly, what effect are such statements in the Picatrixand the Asclepius likely to have had on the prepared minds of Bruno and otherRenaissance Hermetic reformers? Might they not have been inspired to acceleratethe great religious changes they sought by building a magical solar citysomewhere in Western Europe?The high possibility that Bruno would have associated his own Hermeticreformation of Europe with the founding of magical ‘solar’ cities is confirmedby one Guillaume Cotin with whom Bruno spent some time after he returned toFrance from England in 1585. Cotin, the librarian at the Abbey of St. Victor inParis, reports that Bruno had:… heard it said that the Duke of Florence [a Medici] wished to build a CivitasSolis [literally a ‘City of the Sun’] in which the sun would shine every day ofthe year …34 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en886]Just the mention of the words Civitas Solis should immediately bring to the mindof any student of Renaissance magic and the Hermetic tradition the strangemission to Paris of yet another Hermetic thinker. The man in question wasBruno's contemporary and, like him, was also a ‘defrocked’ Dominican monkhounded out of Italy by the Inquisition. Like Bruno, too, he was inspired by theHermetic vision of religious revolution. The greatest similarity of all,however, is that this Bruno clone is famous for having written a book entitledCivitas Solis – ‘The City of the Sun’ – and for seeking out an enlightenedmonarch of ‘solar’ pedigree to install such a utopian city somewhere in theheart of Europe.BRUNO'S FATAL DECISIONWe'll meet the author of the Civitas Solis later in this chapter.Meanwhile Bruno left England in 1585 and sailed back to France, only to findParis in turmoil and a far less hospitable place for him than it once had been.King Henry III, whose favour Bruno had formerly enjoyed, was totally preoccupiedwith the religious war within his realm that was by this point reaching acrescendo.The situation, which we sketched out earlier, was explosive. The Catholicforces, assisted by the Spanish and led by the Count of Guise, were mobilisedoutside Paris. Pope Sixtus V had declared the Protestant leaders Henry ofNavarre and the Prince of Condé to be heretics, thus supposedly debarring Henryfrom the throne of France – a move which, by its provocative implications, wasvirtually a declaration of war against Navarre and the Huguenots. The Catholicclergy in Paris, especially the Jesuits, were inciting the populace withinflammatory sermons against the ‘heretics’ and Huguenots, forcing the meekHenry III to retreat into his convoluted acts of piety, scarcely to be seen inpublic except during those bizarre and morbid religious processions in which heparticipated doing ‘penance’. It was obvious to Bruno that he could no longerrely on royal support.After quarrelling with the scholars at the college at Cambrai, who were incensedover a public attack Bruno had made on Aristotle, the Nolan left France inSeptember 1586 and went to Germany, then Poland, then back to Germany where hestayed until the summer of 1591. At this time that he was seized by a deep – andfor him fatal – nostalgia for Italy and a naïve hope that the newly elected PopeClement VIII could somehow be persuaded to adopt his plans for a universalHermetic reform.Events in France may have encouraged Bruno: Henry of Navarre had been crownedKing Henry IV, and there was already much hopeful talk that this once staunchProtestant prince would soon convert to Catholicism. This was probably seen byBruno as a sign of the impeding great reformation – albeit here within aCatholic framework – that he, Bruno, had been divinely commissioned to bringabout.Fired by such misplaced ideas about himself and his mission, Bruno was probablyin an unusually susceptible state of mind when he received an invitation tobecome the private tutor to a certain Señor Zuane Mocenigo, a Venetian noblemanwho claimed to be a great admirer of the Nolan's works. Mocenigo was put intocontact with Bruno through the Venetian bookseller, Giovanni Battista Ciotto,who knew of the heretic's whereabouts in Germany. Oblivious to the grave dangerof returning to Italy, Bruno impulsively accepted Mocenigo's offer and left forVenice in late 1591.At first the Nolan did not stay with Mocenigo, but took up residenceindependently in Venice. He also travelled to Padua where he stayed from Januaryto March 1592. Ironically, had he stayed a little longer he would probably havemet the author of the Civitas Solis, who was not to arrive in Padua untilOctober that same year. Had they met, the author of Civitas Solis wouldcertainly have warned Bruno of the terrible risks he was taking by staying inItaly, and might have even convinced him to return to Germany where he couldlive in relative safety.But as it turned out, history had reserved for Bruno a far more sinister fate inRome …THE FIELD OF FLOWERSIn March 1592, Bruno finally went to reside at the home of Mocenigo. The latterwas not the gentle student that Bruno was led to believe, but turned out to be avery possessive and vindictive man. It seems Mocenigo wanted Bruno to teach himthe ‘art of memory and invention’ so that he could acquire the Nolan'sintellectual powers for himself. Bruno, however, seems to have been moreconcerned with a book that he had just completed which he intended to dedicateto the Pope Clement VIII in order to win his attention and, hopefully, hissupport and sponsorship. When Bruno announced his intentions to Mocenigo andfurthermore informed him that he was going to Frankfort to have the bookprinted, Mocenigo flew into a fit of rage, locked Bruno in his room, and calledin the Venetian Inquisition.Bruno was arrested and accused of heresy on several counts, being ordered torenounce his beliefs or face trial. Apparently Bruno did renounce but theVenetian inquisitors were unconvinced of his honesty and sent him to Rome forfurther questioning.Thus began an eight-year ordeal at the hands of the Roman Inquisition. Torturedand tormented in the Vatican dungeons, Bruno stood accused of heresy on severalcounts, including his claims of an infinite populated universe (in line withmodern science), that the Earth itself is a planet (it is), and that the symbolof the cross was known to the ancient Egyptians (it was, in the form of theankh, or crux ansata, symbolising the ‘life-force’).Ordered to retract these and his other ‘heresies’ or else face death by burning,Bruno courageously stood firm. He not only refused to retract but also withdrewthe retractions he had made earlier in Venice. Fired by his convictions, hedefiantly told his accusers that he had neither said nor written anything thatwas heretical, but only what was true. When his sentence was passed, Brunobravely stared at the cardinals lined up in front of him and calmly told them:‘Perchance your fear in passing judgement on me is greater than mine inreceiving it.’On the morning of 17 February 1600, Bruno, garbed with a white shirt, was takento the Campo dei Fiori, the ‘Field of Flowers’, a small piazza not far from theRoman Pantheon. There, the Nolan was securely tied to a wooden pole around whichwere stacked planks of wood and bundles of sticks. ‘I die a willing martyr’, heis said to have declared as the fire was being lit all around him, ‘and my soulwill rise with the smoke to paradise.’ A young Protestant, Gaspar Schopp ofBreslau (Wrocław), who had recently converted to Catholicism and thus enjoyedthe favours of the pope, was an eyewitness to the burning, and reported that‘when the image of our Saviour was shown to him before his death he [Bruno]angrily rejected it with averted face’.35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en887] The truth is that a Dominican monkhad tried to brandish a crucifix in Bruno's face while he suffered in theflames. In an act reminiscent of the courage of the Cathar perfecti, and oftheir detestation for the cross, poor Bruno, his legs now charred to the bone,mustered enough strength to turn his head away in disgust.A few days earlier Bruno had written his own epitaph:I have fought … It is much … Victory lies in the hands of Fate. Be that with meas it may, whoever shall prove conqueror, future ages will not deny that I didnot fear to die, was second to none in constancy, and preferred a spirited deathto a craven life.36 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en888]THE ‘ORGANISATION’ AT WORK AGAIN?By burning Giordano Bruno the Inquisition sent a clear and unmistakable messageof intolerance to all who dared think like him: such ancient heresies would becrushed, whenever and wherever they emerged. Bruno's dreams of a great universalHermetic reform or revival – whether within the Christian framework or outsideit – nosedived and burrowed deep underground. From now on any person or groupthinking of religious change of any kind, or even proposing scientific theoriesdeemed contrary to Christian teachings and dogmas, knew very clearly whatawaited them.Not surprisingly perhaps, it was after the death of Giordano Bruno that Europewas to see the resurgence of secret societies and fraternities. It was as iffrom the ashes of Bruno's funeral pyre arose an invisible phoenix that flew outto nurture universal reform elsewhere in Europe. Frances Yates buries in herexcellent book on Bruno and Hermeticism devastating hint as to the identity ofthis invisible, nurturing and revolutionary ‘phoenix’:… one of the most significant aspects of Giordano Bruno [is that] he came at theend of that sixteenth century with its terrible exhibitions of religiousintolerance, in which men were seeking in religious Hermeticism some way oftoleration or union between warring sects… There were many varieties of Christian Hermeticism, Catholic and Protestant,most of them avoiding the magic. And then come Giordano Bruno, taking fullmagical Hermeticism as his basis, preaching a kind of Egyptian CounterReformation, prophesying a return to Egyptianism in which the religiousdifficulties will disappear in some new solution, preaching, too, a moral reformwith emphasis on social good works and an ethic of social utility. As he standsin post-Reformation Oxford, the ex-Dominican has behind him the great ruins ofthe medieval past, and he deplores the destruction of the good works of thoseothers, the predecessors, and the contempt for their philosophy, theirphilanthropy, and their magic. Where is there such a combination as this of religious toleration, emotionallinkage with the medieval past, emphasis on good works for others, andimaginative attachment to the religion and symbolism of the Egyptians? The onlyanswer to this question that I can this of is– in Freemasonry, with its mythical link with the medieval masons, itstoleration, its philanthropy, and its Egyptian symbolism. Freemasonry does notappear in England as a recognisable institution until early in the seventeenthcentury, but it certainly had predecessors, antecedents, traditions of some kindgoing back much earlier, though this is a most obscure subject. We are fumblingin the dark here, among strange mysteries, but one cannot help wondering whetherit might have been among the spiritually dissatisfied in England, who perhapsheard in Bruno's ‘Egyptian’ message some hint of relief, that the strains of theMagic Flute [a euphemism for Freemasonry in reference to Mozart'sMasonic-Egyptian opera] were first breathed upon the air.37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en889]We shall examine such a connection between the Hermetic movement and Freemasonryin later chapters. Meanwhile it very much appeared, on that awful morning ofFebruary 1600, that Bruno's hopes for a great Hermetic reformation of the world,together with his dreams of an ‘Egyptian’ solar city somewhere in Europe, wentup in smoke along with him in the Campo dei Fiori.Or did they?ENTER CAMPANELLAAround the time that the firewood was being heaped at Bruno's feet in Rome,another rebellious monk with much the same sense of mission was tried in Naplesby the Inquisition and thrown in a dungeon. His name was Tommaso Campanella, thefuture author of Civitas Solis.According to Frances Yates:Tommaso Campanella was the last of the line of Italian Renaissance philosophers,of whom Giordano Bruno was the last but one. Like Bruno, Campanella was amagician-philosopher, in the line of the Renaissance Magi descending fromFicino. Campanella is known to have practiced Ficinian magic up to the end ofhis life. Like Bruno, too, Campanella was a Magus with a mission. This huge man… had colossal confidence in himself as in touch with the cosmos and destined tolead a universal magico-religious reform. Unlike Bruno, Campanella was notburned at the stake, though he was several times tortured and spent more thantwenty-seven years of his life in prison. Yet – also unlike Bruno – Campanellavery nearly succeeded in bringing off the project of magical reform within aCatholic framework, or, at least, in interesting a number of very importantpeople in it.38 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en890]But Yates could have been wrong on one important point. As we shall see inChapter Twelve, it is possible that Tommaso Campanella did much more than‘nearly’ succeed in ‘bringing off’ the magical reform.We think that he may have succeeded even beyond Giordano Bruno's wildest dreams…"},{"pageContent":"Campanella spent the rest of his life trying to find the contemporaryrepresentative of the Roman Empire who would build his ‘City of the Sun’ … In1634, Campanella went to France, and transferred his whole scheme … [to] theFrench Monarchy…Frances Yates, Consideration on Bruno and Campanella on the French Monarchy Man lives in a double world: according to the mind he is contained by nophysical space and by no walls, but at the same time he is in heaven and onearth, in Italy, in France, in America, wherever the mind's thrust penetratesand extends by understanding, seeking, mastering. But indeed according to thebody he exists not except in only so much space as is least required, held fastin prison and in chains to the extent that he is not able to be in or to go tothe place attained by his intellect and will, nor to occupy more space thandefined by the shape of his body; while with the mind he occupies a thousandworlds.Tommaso Campanella, Metafisica035 [images/grah_9781934708750_oeb_035_r1.jpg]CHAPTER TWELVEENVISIONING THE HERMETIC CITYGiordano Bruno and Tommaso Campanella were both born in southern Italy – theformer in 1548, the latter in 1568. Both entered the Dominican order at a youngage. Both men had passionate and outspoken personalities. Both detestedAristotle and both were in continuous trouble with the Catholic Church. Bothultimately came to see themselves as Hermetic magi. And both, in their own ways,changed the world.Campanella entered the Dominicans in 1583, when he was 15, but went absentwithout leave six years later in 1589. He settled in Naples where his firstbook, Philosophia sensibus demonstrata (‘Philosophy Demonstrated by the Senses’)was published in 1591. Its contents annoyed the Church but since the book didnot contain sufficient grounds to justify a trial for heresy, charges weretrumped up. Found guilty of harbouring a demonic familiar under the nail of hislittle finger, and denounced for showing a contemptuous attitude to the Church'spower of excommunication, he was imprisoned for several months in 1592 at theDominican convent in Naples.1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en891]After his release later that year Campanella made his way to Padua. There in1593 he was accused of sodomy (an indictment frequently cast at those theInquisition wished to tarnish) but acquitted. Clearly a marked man by this pointhe was soon charged with other heretical acts: writing a sonnet against Christ;possessing a book of magic; and not accepting the rule and doctrine of theChurch. Rather gravely he was also accused of debating matters concerning theChristian faith with a ‘Judaiser’ – who had lapsed from Christianity – withouthaving denounced the man to the Inquisition.2[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en892]In February 1594 Campanella underwent his first bout of torture at theInquisition's hands. He was tortured again, more severely, in July the same yearand his case was handed over to Rome. On 11 October 1594 he was flung into thesame dungeons as Bruno – but apparently not the same cell for there is no recordof the two meeting there. Released seven months later in May 1595 while his casewas being determined, Campanella was found to be in poor health and sufferingfrom hernia, sciatica, consumption and partial paralysis.3[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en893] He was rearrested in December1596, imprisoned again, released in January 1597, rearrested in March 1597 andimprisoned again until December 1597 – on the latter occasion in theInquisition's worst prison in Rome. His release came after he had abjured hisheresies, accepted the prohibition of all his books, and agreed to reside forthe remainder of his life in his native province of Calabria to the south ofNaples.4 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en894]A NEW SORT OF REPUBLIC AND A HEAVENLY CITYIt was not Campanella's destiny to live out his days quietly in Calabria. Nosooner had he arrived home in July 1598 than he became embroiled in disputeswith the local authorities. His writing began to take on a political tinge andalso to hint that he possessed prophetic powers – given biblical sanction bySaint Paul in I Corinthians 14:31: ‘For ye shall all prophesy one by one, thatall may learn, and all may be comforted.’What Campanella seemed to be prophesying, however – a revolution in Calabriaagainst the authority of the kingdom of Naples5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en895] – did not comfort the Church. ‘Itoccurred to me,’ he wrote early in 1599, ‘that revolution ought to happen soon.’To confirm this he consulted ‘several astrologers’ and they agreed ‘thatpolitical revolution ought to occur for us.’6[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en896] Elsewhere definitely with more inmind than just Calabria, he predicted:If a general transformation should impend for us, certainly it will happen on acrucial date, thus in the next seven-year period following the year 1600.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en897]Between February and April 1599 Campanella became an increasingly stridentpublic preacher using the pulpit to forecast the imminence of ‘grave upheavals’and apocalyptic events.8 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en898] He beganto attract a popular following amongst all social classes in Calabria, includingpowerful noblemen, and with incredible rapidity found himself at the centre ofexactly what he had prophesied – a revolutionary conspiracy. He and hisco-conspirators even planned to enlist the services of the Ottomon Turkish fleetin their rebellion and entered into negotiations to this end.9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en899]But the uprising was doomed from the start, beset by poor coordination andgrandiose but muddled objectives. At the political level these objectivesinvolved the establishment of something very much ahead of its time, describedby Campanella's biographer, Professor John Headley, as ‘a new sort ofrepublic’.10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en900] Since it was to havebeen run along egalitarian principles and guided by benevolentscientist-priests,11 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en901] we arereminded, irresistibly, of the actual conditions that the Cathar per fecti hadsucceeded in fostering in Occitania in the late 12th century before theAlbigensian Crusades .12 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en902]Additionally Campanella set out what sounds like a manifesto for the Hermeticidea of ‘building the City of the Sun’ in his proposed republic:And although some Fathers sustain … that only in heaven will be realised thereconciled future community, nevertheless [others], with whom I agree, allow fora literal interpretation according to which some sort of prelude of the heavenlycity is already to be realised on earth.13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en903] [Emphasis added]This idea of building on earth an imperfect replica or ‘prelude’ of the City ofGod, the City of Heaven, the City of the Sun – or any one of a number of othercelestial cities – is as old as the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts (roughly 2300BC) as we saw in Chapter Nine. It is also, we know, central to the agenda of theHermetic Texts (roughly 100 BC – AD 300). It was to become the dominantobsession of Campanella's life which, partly due to luck, and partly to his ownresilience and quick-wittedness, did not end over a slow fire when his Calabrian‘revolution’ failed.IN AN INSANE WORLD ONLY THE MAD ARE SANEIn August 1599 two defectors gave the conspiracy away. Campanella fled but wascaptured and imprisoned on 13 September in the castle at Squillace. At the endof October 1599 he was herded together with 155 of his co-conspirators into fourgalleys sailing for Naples. On arrival at the port of Naples sixteen of theprisoners were hanged – four from the yardarm of each of the galleys. Two morewere ceremoniously slaughtered by quartering (being torn into four parts) on thewharf. 14 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en904]As the mind behind the proposed revolutionary new republic with its sky-city tobe built on earth, and as a man who had already come several times to theattention of the Inquisition, Campanella was now in imminent danger. One ofseveral clerics to have participated in the conspiracy, he was investigated by atribunal of inquisitors specially-appointed by Pope Clement VIII on 11 January1600. The tribunal at once requested and was granted permission to use certainkinds of torture including week-long periods of underground isolation andsensory deprivation, as well as a nasty technique called the polledro that was‘designed to rupture veins and tissue’15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en905] without actually drawing blood.After some weeks a partial confession was extracted from Campanella to theeffect that he had indeed wanted to create a new sort of republic. But herealised that his best defence to the charges against him was to pretend to havebeen insane all along and thus not responsible for his actions. To help convincethe Inquisition of this it seems that on 2 April 1600 he set fire to thecontents of his cell .16 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en906]Three interrogations in quick succession, all accompanied by torture, followedon 17, 18 and 20 May 1600. Through these, and for the next 12 months ofrecurrent agonies, Campanella faultlessly maintained his charade of insanity.Then at the end of May 1601 an order was received from Rome requiring theinquisitors to prove once and for all whether he was really mad or just feigningmadness – and to do so by means of a terrible torture device called la veglia,‘the awakener’. Campanella could stop the excruciating pain it would inflictupon him at any time simply by admitting that his madness was feigned. In thatcase he would be burnt at the stake as an impenitent heretic. If on the otherhand he could withstand its pains for 40 hours then he was to be judged legallyinsane. This would mean that whatever else might happen to him, he could not beburnt by the Inquisition.17 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en907]BEATING THE AWAKENERCampanella's life-or-death duel with ‘the awakener’ took place on 4 – 5 June1601 in the dungeons of Castel Nuovo, one of the great Neapolitan prisons.18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en908] The peculiar and horrible cunningof this torture, as Professor Headley describes, is that:The victim is suspended in such a way that only his arms and shoulder musclesprevent his body from coming to rest on a set of wooden spikes; eventually,however, he tires and must allow the spikes to gash his buttocks and thighsuntil he can once more raise himself. Thus between these positions he must moveback and forth.19 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en909]It seems that several times during the hours of unremitting suffering that heendured – his diligent inquisitors taking notes all the while – Campanella criedout incoherently and uttered strange, usually meaningless phrases as thoughdelirious: ‘ten white horses’; ‘I am slaughtered’; ‘Enthrone and shut up’. Inthe midst of all this, pointing out that his body was plainly ruined and likelyto die, his torturers suggested he should give thought to the salvation of hissoul. He somehow found the energy and will to yell hoarsely back a four-wordstatement of his core belief:The soul is immortal!20 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en910] This was a belief that he shared with the Hermetic and Gnostic sages of ancientAlexandria, and with the Cathars. The same belief would also later be taken upand trumpeted by the French Revolution as we saw in Chapter One.Ten hours passed, then 20, then 30. Finally, writes Professor Headley:After 40 hours, near death, yet spiritually unbroken, his simulation of madnessundiscovered, our prisoner was cut down. According to canon law his insanity hadbeen established; therefore he could not be executed.21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en911]Campanella's jailer, who became his personal friend, records that as he liftedthe broken body from the embrace of ‘the awakener’ to carry him back to his cellthe supposed madman whispered the following question hoarsely in his ear:Did they really think that I would be enough of a blockhead to speak?22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en912]THE FIRST EUROPEAN CELEBRITYHe had escaped the fire, but he still remained very much in the frying pan.Legally mad or not, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the dungeons ofNaples without any hope of parole.After everything he had already been through, such a grim prospect would havekilled a lesser man but somehow the indomitable Campanella refused to abandonoptimism and fade away. Instead, though he was kept for many years in a damp,dark, subterranean cell, he constantly made use of his brilliant mind. Hecomposed poetry – some of which he managed to write down himself, some of whichhe dictated – and wrote countless letters to influential figures around Europewho he hoped might have the power to set him free. Most extraordinary of all, hesomehow also managed to produce his great philosophical work Civitas Solis (‘TheCity of the Sun’), with its magical ‘natural religion’ and its scientist-priestsruled by one of their number called ‘Sun’. Not only that but Campanellasuccessfully arranged to have the completed manuscript smuggled out of prison byone of his loyal disciples – a certain Tobias Adami, who we will meet again inChapter Thirteen. Though it stirred great interest, and is widely recognised byhistorians of ideas as the inspiration for many of the great utopian schemes ofthe 17th and 18th centuries, no scholar seems yet to have seriously consideredthe possibility that Campanella's Civitas Solis could ever have been much morethan just an idea – let alone that someone might actually have attempted tobuild it. Yet it is precisely this possibility that we intend to pursue.Civitas Solis was by no means Campanella's only full-length work during hisimprisonment. It is the most important, but much of his other output also provedto be exciting and provocative intellectual fare. All things considered hisachievements were prodigious and after a little more than quarter of a centuryhad passed, aged over 60 – and despite his sentence to perpetual imprisonmentwithout parole – Campanella did win back his liberty. The final decade of hisconfinement until his release, first into house-arrest in 1627 and then at lastto freedom in 1629, was spent in increasing comfort as mysterious friends inhigh places lobbied on his behalf.23[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en913] Even before graduating tohouse-arrest he was already being allowed to hold tutorials, give full-scalelectures, and receive visiting VIPs in his cell – many of whom arrived withcopies of his books which he would graciously autograph for them. He managed totransform himself, in a sense, into the Nelson Mandela of the Renaissance, ‘oneof the sights to see if visiting Naples’, as John Headley puts it:Campanella had not only survived; he had become possibly the first Europeancelebrity.24 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en914]After gaining his freedom in 1629, Campanella stayed for some years in Italy,much of the time in Rome. There he was drawn into the circle of the Frenchambassador, François de Noailles. In 1634 came reports of another uprising inthe Naples area led by a certain Tommaso Pignatelli, once a disciple ofCampanella. When captured Pignatelli wrongfully accused his former master ofinvolvement in the conspiracy, placing him in immediate jeopardy of arrest. Now66 years old, and understandably phobic about any idea of a return to prison,Campanella sought refuge in the French embassy. Soon afterwards, disguised andusing the ambassador's personal carriage, he was smuggled out of Italy intoFrance.25 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en915]FRANCE UPDATE: MURDERS AND PLOTSThings had changed in France since Giordano Bruno had enjoyed protection there.Henry III had died in 1589 a year after his domineering mother, Catherinede’Medici, and the throne had passed to Henry of Navarre, now crowned Henry IVof France. As we saw in Chapter Ten, Henry of Navarre, who belonged to thepowerful Bourbon family, was a Protestant and had converted to Catholicism in1593 in order to neutralise those who opposed his coronation as king of France.But not everyone was convinced of Henry's sincerity in this all-too-convenient‘conversion’. Certainly Bruno had not been – although his own theory, statedduring his trial, was that Henry of Navarre was from the outset a Catholic atheart:When I praised the King of Navarre, I did not praise him because he was anadherent of the heretics [Protestants], but for the reason that… he was nototherwise a heretic, but that he lived as a heretic from desire of ruling.26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en916]Among those who most doubted Henry IV’s ‘conversion’ were the Jesuits – the‘Society of Jesus’, founded by Saint Ignatius of Loyola a century or sopreviously – whom the king had, in fact, distrusted all his life. ‘They willkill me one day’, he is reported to have confided in his close friends, ‘I cansee that they are putting all their resources into my death.’27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en917]Sure enough, on 14 May 1610, Henry IV was assassinated by a religious fanatic,François Ravaillac. The official story told by the Church was that even underthe most persuasive torture, Ravaillac had insisted that there were noaccomplices to the crime and that he had acted entirely on his own initiative.But many, especially the Protestant Huguenots, believed that he had been put upto the murder by the Jesuits.Others went so far as to suspect the involvement of Henry IV’s Catholic queen,Marie de’Medici. Their marriage had been famously unhappy. It was also wellknown, and obviously suspicious, that barely two months before the assassinationMarie had persuaded her husband to make her regent of France should he suffer anuntimely death. Her official coronation as regent occurred on 13 May and Henrywas murdered less than 24 hours later.28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en918] The coincidence was alarming, tosay the least. But nothing could be proved against Marie and the blame, rightlyor wrongly, fell entirely on the wretched Ravaillac. He suffered the ultimatelypenalty for regicide: first to be tortured with red-hot pincers, then seethed inhot oil, and finally, still alive, to be ripped apart by four farm horsestethered to his arms and legs.THE LOW LIBIDO OF LOUIS XIIIHenry IV’s eldest son Louis – the future Louis XIII – was only nine years oldwhen his father was assassinated and Marie de’Medici's position as his regentwas legally unassailable. He was crowned king in 1614 when he reached therequired minimum age of 13 but was at first entirely dominated by his ambitiousmother. He gradually began to assert his authority and in 1631, at the age of30, he at last took full control of his throne and had Marie de’Medici banishedforever from France.Louis XIII had been married to the Spanish Infanta Anne of Austria, daughter ofPhilip III of Spain, when they were both only 14 years old, and the marriageremained unconsummated for many years. Of a very curious nature and disposition,Louis was more interested in his hobbies of repairing locks and making jams thanin having sex with his wife. It was clear that the young man was very muchunlike his father, Henry IV, who had seduced so many women during his shortreign that it had earned him the nickname of Le Vert Galant (‘the GreenGallant’), 17th century French slang for ‘sexy’.Louis’ low libido wasn't the only problem. It was also obvious that he justplainly disliked his Spanish wife, even though she was openly affectionate tohim, and perhaps even loved him. According to French historian Jean Duché,things had deteriorated so much that on a cold night in January 1619 Louispractically had to be dragged out of his own bed by leading courtiers and takenforcibly to the queen's chamber in order finally to consummate his marriage.29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en919] Two years later the queen – almostmiraculously one could say in such circumstances – was found to be pregnant.Unfortunately she suffered an accident in the Louvre Palace and miscarried. Theking's peculiar response to this was not sympathy but fury and he seems to havebecame even more reluctant to perform his marital duties after this tragedy.As the years went by the desperation of the young and warm-blooded queen becameso pronounced that she sought some affection by causally flirting with thedashing and very handsome Duke of Buckingham, the British ambassador in Paris.Rumours reached the ears of Louis XIII that his wife was having an affair withthe duke, which in those days was an act of treason punishable by death. Butbeing a very devoted and strict Catholic, it is unlikely that the queen wouldhave taken such a risk. At any rate, and luckily for her, the king was persuadedof her innocence. And so, by the time Tommaso Campanella arrived in Paris 1634,a dark, cold and solemn mood had fallen over the royal couple, and everyone bythen had given up on seeing them produce an heir for the Bourbon dynasty.But then, as if by magic, something rather wonderful and strange happened …BRIEF EXCURSION TO SOME BURIED EGYPTIAN TREASURESSince time immemorial a certain glamour of magic and mystery always surroundedthe kings of France – whose origins were steeped in fabulous legends and myths.At the root of these were three successive royal houses, some even say races,known as the Merovingians, the Carolingians and the Capetians. All were bound bya very ancient Teutonic law, the so-called Salic Law, introduced by the SalianFranks who had invaded Gaul in the fifth century AD.This Salic Law had been formalised by Clovis, the founder of the Merovingiandynasty, and was later repromulgated by the legendary Charlemagne, CarolusMagnus, founder of the Carolingian dynasty and first emperor of the Holy RomanEmpire. The Capetian dynasty was founded in AD 987 when Hugh Capet became kingof France. And through some oblique and rather dubious historical logic, theValois and the Bourbon families also regarded themselves as linked, if not byblood then ‘spiritually’, to these ancient roots and, more directly, to theCapetians. The Capetian bloodline ended in 1328 with the death of Charles theFair. The latter had left no sons or even brothers to succeed him and thus thethrone of France had gone to his cousin, Philip of Valois, known as Philip VI‘the Fortunate’.30 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en920]In 1653 a mysterious treasure-trove was unearthed at Tournai (today part ofBelgium), where the ancient Merovigian kings had set their capital. Thediscovery caused quite a stir at the time because the artefacts, mostly smallitems of gold and bronze, were believed to be from the tomb of King Childeric(c. AD 460), the father of Clovis. We note with interest that amongst theartefacts recovered was a golden Apis bull, a small statue of Isis and, inanother nearby find at Saint-Brice, dozens of golden bees. In ancient Egyptianmyths bees were the tears of the sun-god Ra while the hieroglyphic symbol of thebee was part of the royal titulary of the pharaohs (as in ‘He of the Sedge andthe Bee’).31 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en921] Interesting too isthe fact that the Egyptian character of these artefacts was correctly identifiedby savants at this 17th century French court who went on to suggest a connectionbetween the Merovingian dynasty and the Isis-Serapis solar cults of ancientEgypt.32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en922]PREDICTING A CAPETIAN MIRACLETommaso Campanella arrived at the French court in 1634. This was a full 20 yearsafter the marriage of Louis XIII to the Spanish Infanta Anne of Austria and theroyal couple remained without child. The prospects of a continuation of theBourbon dynasty looked dim and it was the general view that there was not goingto be a ‘Capetian miracle’ – the mocking term being used by this point todescribe the likelihood of a royal successor.The big problem, and the source of all sorts of rumours and gossip at court, wasthat Louis XIII flatly refused to have any sexual contact with his wife. Theking was thought (variously) to be impotent, simply not interested in women, orperhaps a homosexual.33 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en923]Reinforcing the latter speculation was the rather bizarre relationship,bordering on romantic love, which Louis was now publicly enjoying with hispersonal valet, the young Marquis of Cinq-Mars. Further complicating the matter,the king was unwell and suffered from tuberculosis. Last but not least, andnotwithstanding the business with his (male) valet, he was also romantically inlove with a young and very pious lady, Mlle Louise de la Fayette, who hadentered a convent in Paris. Somewhat reminiscent of the pure Platonic love oncepromoted by the troubadours of Occitania, this affair of the king's had nosexual element to it whatsoever but was felt at court to be a distraction fromany potential sexual encounters he might otherwise have had with the queen!The queen herself, of course, was the one who felt most strongly about thematter. Hearing that the famous prophet and magus Tommaso Campanalla hadrecently arrived in France, she summoned him to her side. He had been highlyrecommended to her by Cardinal Richelieu, and she wanted to have his propheticopinion on the matter of the succession.There was nothing unusual about this. The queen and Richelieu, like mostintelligent and highly-placed people of their epoch, were much influenced byprophetic and astrological predictions. Many European monarchs of the 16th and17th centuries are known to have had their personal astrologers who wereconsulted regularly on matters of state, of marriage and even of war. Indeed,through intermediaries, Richelieu had already consulted Campanella on manyoccasions and, no doubt, the nerve-racking question of the succession must havebeen often raised and discussed.34 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en924]The two men were to become close confidantes with Campanella dedicating a numberof his new works to Richelieu and calling for the cardinal's assistance to‘build the City of the Sun’ as expounded in the Civitas Solis which had justbeen reissued in Paris.35 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en925]Brokered by Richelieu, Campanella's meeting with the queen came quickly and, tothe court's amazement, the magus boldly predicted that soon the French monarchywould be blessed with an heir.36 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en926]The heir, moreover, would be a male child who, like the very Sun itself, wouldillumine the whole world and usher in a glorious and golden era for humanity:Everyone will acknowledge a single Father and a single God and love will unitethem all … Kings and nations … will gather in a city which will be namedHeliaca, The City of the Sun, which will be built by this illustrious hero [thefuture ‘solar’ king of France] … 37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en927]As Jean Meyer delicately puts it, Campanella had taken a very dangerous,high-stakes gamble by proclaiming the imminent birth of a male heir to theFrench throne. If he were proved right he stood to gain much, if wrong hisreputation would be ruined.GOD SENTA flash thunderstorm over the city of Paris on a cold winter's day was to playin Campanella's favour, and his prophetic gamble would pay off. For early oneafternoon in December 1637, Louis XIII left his small weekend residence atVersailles and made his way to the Château de Saint-Maur, where he intended tospend the night. En route he decided to make a stop in Paris at the convent ofSt. Marie on the Rue Saint-Antoine, where Louise de la Fayette, his platonic andvery pious lady friend, lived.With his bodyguards waiting outside, and an old nun serving as chaperone, theking and Sister Louise de la Fayette sat in a secluded part of the conventtalking in whispers. When finally night fell, the king decided it was time togo, but he was informed by the captain of the guards, a man called Guitaut, whowas deeply devoted to the queen, that there was a violent storm outside, makingthe trip to Saint-Maur imprudent. Guitaut strongly advised the king that itwould be safer for him to spend the night at the Louvre Palace which was muchcloser.38 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en928]There was one small problem. The queen had her private apartments at the Louvre,and the king did not relish the prospect of spending the night in her company.But as the storm grew more violent, and with Guitaut constantly reminding theking that the queen would most certainly be overjoyed to receive him at theLouvre, Louis had not much choice by to agree. A guard was sent ahead to warnAnne of this wonderful opportunity that was presenting itself. A candlelitsupper was quickly arranged, and a spare bed brought to the queen's chambers.The loyal Captain Guitaut had made sure that the news was sent to all theconvents and churches in Paris to pray in unison for the long awaited event …Sure enough, exactly nine months later, on 5 September 1638, Anne of Austriagave birth to a male child who was christened Louis – the future Louis XIV. Asthough as a reminder that this great miracle had been prophesied by TommasoCampanella, it so happened that 5 September was also Campanella's 70th birthday.Now amidst great jubilations and prayers of thanks, the rapturous and verygrateful queen summoned the magus and asked him to cast the natal horoscope forher son – who was already spoken of as the Dieudonné, the ‘God-sent’. We knowthat Campanella paid at least two visits to the queen's private chamber, waspresent when she breastfed the infant, and was even given the immense honour ofholding the future king in his arms.39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en929] Finally, after thoroughlyexamining the child, he announced, somewhat underwhelmingly, that the reign ofLouis XIV would be long happy, and glorious.40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en930]But he had more to say in his Latin eclogue for Louis XIV, which appeared inprint in January 1639.41 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en931] Modelledon the messianic Fourth Eclogue of Virgil (which had prophesied the universalrule of Augustus Caesar), Campanella's expanded prophecy leaves no doubt aboutthe future he saw for the French monarchy and the forthcoming reign of LouisXIV. Quite simply, it was divinely ordained to bring about the great universal‘Hermetic-Christian’ reform that Bruno had dreamt of, and to build the ‘City ofthe Sun’ which he, Campanella, had promoted .42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en932]So it is time to ask – what did Campanella really have in mind? What type of‘solar city’ was he thinking of? Was it a real city or merely a symbolic visionof some utopian reform to be ushered in by the French monarchy?A HERMETIC SIGNATURESo far we can see that Campanella had succeeded in his Hermetic mission whereBruno before him had failed. True, Bruno had managed to gain some backing fromHenry III of France and even had his chance to present his own Hermetic-Egyptianvision of universal reform to the scholars in Paris and Oxford. But what it allfinally amounted to had been a heap of ashes in Rome's Campo dei Fiori.Campanella, on the other hand, thanks to his more cunning temperament andgreater ability to deal with complex human relationships, now held the supportof the French royal couple and their powerful minister, Richelieu. This, thoughit came very late in his life, gave him the almost unbelievable opportunity toplant the seed of his own vision of reform right in the heart of the Frenchmonarchy. Did not Campanella once boast, asks Frances Yates, that he could ‘makea City in such a wonderful way that only by looking at it all the sciences maybe learned’?43 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en933] Now at last he wasin a position to make good on his pledge.Yates quite rightly sees in Campanella ‘a more successful Bruno’44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en934] and writes that ‘it does look verymuch as though a torch may have passed from Bruno to Campanella.’45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en935] She also points up another aspectof the mystery, something far more subtle and vague, that no one else seems tohave seen before her. In her view Campanella's Civitas Solis was ‘ultimatelyEgyptian in origin’:It is now clear that to the Roman ideal of universal empire returning in a newgolden age, to the Platonic ideal of a state in which philosophers ruled,Campanella added a third ideal, that of the Egyptian state kept intact andeternal by priestly magic. The Sun ruler of the City of the Sun is both priestand king, supreme in both the spiritual and the temporal domains, in short he isHermes Trismegistus, priest, philosopher and king. Campanella was thus in nosense a liberal revolutionary. His ideal was an all powerful theocracy like thatof Egypt, so powerful that it regulated by scientific magic the celestialinfluences and through them the whole life of the people. Its apparently liberalside is that it encouraged scientific enquiry and invention … but this advancedSolarian science was in the hands of the supreme priesthood and regulated by it– as in ancient Egypt.46 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en936]In our view it is not a coincidence that the ‘liberal revolutionary’ aspects ofCampanella's utopia – to be based on the principles of truth, justice andbrotherly love, and characterised by freedom of speech, equal rights for women,good health care, and universal education for children 47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en937] – had already begun to be realisedin Occitania hundreds of years before.48[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en938] Nor is it likely to be anaccident, as we saw in Chapter One, that they were to appear again, linked tothe work of Voltaire, Rousseau and other leading lights of those times, in thephilosophical and intellectual undercurrents of the 1789 French Revolution.The strangest and most striking aspect of Campanella's scheme, however, and theone that Yates particularly draws attention to, is its Egyptianism. The Hermeticmagus cleverly grafted it onto the French monarchy in the person of the futureLouis XIV, thus ensuring it's acceptability within the existing systems ofEurope. But at the same time there is no doubt that what Campanella ultimatelyhad in mind was a revival of the ancient Egyptian ‘golden age’ when a ‘solar’king and his wise and benevolent ‘scientific-priesthood’ had regulated andgoverned the land.Were such thinking to be carried through to its logical conclusion then we wouldexpect Louis XIV to have left a Hermetic signature on the landscape of France.We would expect him, in short, as Campanella had prophesied in the Latineclogue, to have built, or to have attempted to build, the ‘City of the Sun’.HIDDEN MAGICAL SPRINGSOf course it's always possible that the ‘City of the Sun’ was just a metaphorfor an ideal type of society, rather than something that was intended to berealised in bricks and mortar. Yet there is much in Campanella's scheme, and inthe Hermetic teachings, that that leads us to think otherwise. Most significantis the thoroughly ‘astral’ character of his model which constantly leverages theintimate feedback mechanisms between sky and ground, above and below, that areenvisaged in the Hermetic texts.The broad plan of Campanella's ‘City of the Sun’ as he sets it out in his greatwork Civitas Solis, looks like a diagram of the Copernican solar system. At itscentre, on a raised mound, is a perfectly circular temple of gigantic size(representing the Sun) with its dome supported on soaring pillars. Ringing thetemple are the seven concentric divisions of the city (one for each of theorbits of the then known planets) separated by walls penetrated by gates facingthe cardinal directions – north, south, east and west. Two axial roadwaystraverse the city entirely, crossing, as it were, at the centre, one running duenorth-south and the other due east-west.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en939]Within the vast ‘Temple of Sun’ lying at the heart of all this geometricalperfection Campanella's text envisages an altar on which is to be found nothingexcept two huge globes, one showing ‘all the heaven’ and the other ‘all theearth’.50 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en940] On the ceiling of thedome are depicted ‘all the greatest stars of heaven, with their names and thepowers which they have over things below’; these representations are incorrespondence with the globes on the altar. Seven eternal lamps also hang inthe temple, called after the seven planets. The outer wall of the temple bears arepresentation of ‘every star in its order’.51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en941]Images and writings are inscribed on both the outer and inner faces of each ofthe seven sets of concentric walls and these seem primarily aimed to educate andinspire the citizenry. They include more world maps, cultural geographies ofdifferent peoples, representations of seas and rivers, knowledge about theanimal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, and images of ‘inventors of sciences andlaws’ – an eclectic list including Hermes Trismegistus (in his Romaniseddisguise as Mercury), Jupiter (Zeus-Amun in the Graeco-Egyptian pantheon ofAlexandria), the Prophet Muhammad, Jesus Christ and his 12 apostles, and, lastbut not least, Osiris.52 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en942]In summary, observes Frances Yates, the city that Campanella wanted, andprophesied that Louis XIV would in some way build, was to be ‘a completereflection of the world as governed by the laws of natural magic in dependenceon the stars.’53 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en943] It was to becarefully arranged ‘so as to be right with the stars’ – the source of ‘all itshappiness, health and virtue.’54 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en944]Its ruler was to be priest who was to be ‘head in all things, both spiritual andtemporal’,55 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en945] while its governancewas to be in the hands of great men who could understand and use natural magic:‘inventors, moral teachers, miracle workers, religious leaders, in short, Magi …’56 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en946] They were to be selectedaccording to their ability, in the words of Marcilio Ficino, to ‘draw down thelife of heaven’ for the benefit of mankind .57[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en947]The intellectual origins of Campanella's grand scheme, Yates shows, are not tobe sought (except perhaps superficially) in contemporary or near contemporaryworks he might have known such as Thomas More's Utopia. ‘To find the ultimatesource,’ she argues, ‘one must dig deeper and uncover those hidden magicalsprings from which the Renaissance was fed.’ She means the Hermetic texts andsingles out particularly the Picatrix with its magical city of Adocentyn,reminding us that it featured:… a castle with four gates, on which were images into which Hermes Trismegistushad introduced spirits. Compare this with the four gates and roads of the Cityof the Sun. On the summit of the castle was a lighthouse which flashed over thecity the colours of the seven planets. Compare this with the seven planetarylamps always burning in the City of the Sun … In the passage in Picatrixdescribing the City of Adocentyn Hermes Trismegistus is also said to have builta temple to the Sun …58 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en948]In other words, Yates concludes, ‘the deepest, the primary layer of influencebehind the City of the Sun is, I suggest, Hermetic; and its first model, towhich many later influences have been superadded, is, I believe, the magicalcity of Adocentyn described in the Picatrix, and the description in theAsclepius of the religion of the Egyptians.’59[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en949]In Chapter Eight we quoted at the length the famous Lament from the Asclepius inwhich we hear of the destruction by inimical forces of the magical, naturalreligion of the Egyptians, and its apparent disappearance from the earth for along interval of time. But the reader will recall that the Asclepius also makesthe prophecy: that the persecuted religion will one day be restored in ‘areformation of all good things, and a restitution most holy and most reverent ofnature itself.’ Most important of all, this restoration and restitution are tobe triggered by the founding of a City aligned with the Sun .60[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en950]Could Louis have been influenced by Campanella to carry such thinking through toits logical conclusion and leave a Hermetic signature in the architecture ofFrance? If so the old magus must somehow have found a way to reach out to himfrom beyond the grave – for he died in Paris on 21 May 1639, eight and a halfmonths after the young ‘Sun King’ was born.In matters of influence, however, as we shall see (and as the Hermetic textsthemselves advise), it is best to presume that ‘nothing is imposible.’61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en951]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENTHE INVISIBLE BROTH ERHOOD[Cardinal] Richelieu did not receive the Rosicrucians, but when eleven yearslater Campanella came to Paris he had the powerful cardinal's support – anindication of Campanella's success in switching his ideas … into channelsacceptable to the powers that be.Frances Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition The Rosicrucians, do they exist? Are you one?…Frances Yates, The Rosicrucian Enlightenment In 1623, during the reign of Louis XIII and 11 years before Tommasso Campanellaarrived at the French court, a subversive organisation made its presence knownin Paris. Stealthily, by night, eye-catching placards were put up on the wallsof public buildings and in all the main streets of the city, bearing thefollowing announcement:We, being deputies of the principal College of the Brothers of the Rose Cross,are making a visible and invisible stay in this city through the Grace of theMost High, towards whom turn the hearts of the Just. We show and teach withoutbooks or marks how to speak all languages of the countries where we wish to be,and to draw men from error and death.1[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en952]Another poster contained a variant of the message with more specificallyreligious overtones:We deputies of the College of the Rose Cross, give notice to all those who wishto enter our Society and Congregation, that we will teach them the most perfectknowledge of the Most High, in the name of whom we are today holding anassembly, and we will make them from visible, invisible, and from invisible,visible …2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en953]As it had certainly been intended to do, the poster campaign caused quite a stirin Paris. Contemporary reports speak of a ‘hurricane’ of rumour at the news thatthe mysterious Rose Cross fraternity – already believed to be active in Germany– had now come to France.3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en954]Pamphlets and further rumours (although of a rather concrete and specificnature) had it that the core of the brotherhood was formed by 36 ‘InvisibleOnes’ – implying that they were veiled, incognito, disguised – who weredispersed throughout the world in six groups of six.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en955] They held their assemblies at thetime of the summer solstice, the longest day of the year. And although thelanguage of the pamphlets and posters seemed religious and obviously Christianit was said that adepts of the fraternity ‘swore to abjure Christianity and allthe rights and sacraments of the Church.’5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en956]To understand the sort of moral panic, accompanied in many cases by a thrill ofillicit excitement, which was generated by hints and rumours like these we needto keep in mind the general condition of Europe in 1623. For more than acentury, bloody religious conflicts between Catholics and Protestants had beentearing the peoples of the Continent apart creating a climate of overwhelmingfear and suspicion, and now the great struggle in central Europe that was tobecome the Thirty Years War had just begun, further inflaming the deep hatredsand passions of the time. So it was natural that everyone, particularly thecourt and the government of France, would feel disturbed and even a littlethreatened by these announcements that a clandestine brotherhood had set up shopin Paris and intended to save the people from ‘error and death’.Who was behind all this provocative propaganda? Who was responsible? Who werethe ‘invisible’ people calling themselves brothers of the Rose Cross?Although a mass of material supposedly stemming from these original‘Rosicrucians’ has come to light, scholars still debate such questions today andhave proposed no definitive answers. All that is clear – whoever they were – isthat the self-styled ‘invisible’ brothers must have been cut from very much thesame cloth as men like Bruno and Campanella. Though their methods were moreguarded than those of the great Hermetic magi, they saw themselves in the sameway as being endowed with special magical powers, or knowledge, or ‘science’that could be used to bring about a religious and intellectual reform of theworld.THE ROSICRUCIAN MANIFESTOSIf a secret society is successful – which means, by definition, that it isdifficult to detect in its own epoch – then we may suppose that its traces areunlikely to be easily found by the historians of a later epoch. If we take theRosicrucians at face value as a secret society, therefore, it follows that wereally can't say for sure how long they may have existed undetected before theydeclared themselves. All we know is that the first direct and definitereferences to them were made in Germany during the 20 years before the 1623poster campaign in Paris. From this early activity comes almost everything weknow, or think we know, about the ‘Invisible College’ of the Rose Cross.The name ‘Rosicrucian’ is derived from ‘Christian Rosenkreutz’, i.e. ChristianRose Cross or Rosy Cross, the hero of two small books, deep and most unusual intheir contents, that were first published at Cassel in Germany in the years 1614and 1615. The full title of the first is Fama Fraternitatis, or a Discovery ofthe Fraternity of the Most Noble Order of the Rosy Cross. Scholars generallyrefer to it as the Fama. The second, published in 1615 and usually known as theConfessio, is titled in full: Confessio Fraternitatis, or the Confession of theLaudible Fraternity of the Most Honourable Order of the Rosy Cross, Written toall the Learned of Europe. These two texts amount in English translation to atotal of less than 25 pages and are known collectively as the ‘RosicrucianManifestos’.6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en957]THE FAMAThe Fama purports to be the work of a group of Rosicrucian adepts and tells thestory of ‘the most godly and highly illumined Father, our Brother, C. R.[Christian Rosenkreutz], a German, the chief and original of our Fraternity,’whose aim was to bring about a ‘general reformation.’ It seems that as a youththis C. R. had set out on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land but had stopped on theway amongst the ‘wise men of Damascus’. Receiving him ‘not as a stranger but asone whom they had long expected’ they showed him secret things, ‘whereat hecould not but mightily wonder’, and taught him knowledge of physics andmathematics. C. R. was so magnetised by his studies that he lost all interest inreaching Jerusalem – his original objective – and spent three years with theDamascene sages, undergoing what sounds very much like a Hermetic initiation .7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en958]Finally, with their blessing, he began to make his way westwards again. First hejourneyed into Egypt. Then he ‘sailed across the whole Mediterranean Sea for tocome unto Fez’ (Morocco). There the ‘Elementary Inhabitants’, members of anoccult society of ‘magicians, Cabalists, physicians, and philosophers … revealedunto him many of their secrets.’ However the knowledge that he had learned inDamascus seems to have been superior to theirs since he judged that ‘their Magiawas not altogether pure … their Cabala was defiled with their religion.’8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en959]After two years in Fez, Brother C. R. moved on, this time to Spain and thenceinto the rest of Europe. He wished to share the great wisdom he had learned inthe East and to teach the wise men of the West ‘the errors of our [i.e. Western]arts, and how they might be corrected … also how the faults of the Church andthe whole Philosophia Moralis was to be amended.’ However he was ridiculed andattacked by the scholars to whom he unfolded his ideas because they ‘feared thattheir great name should be lessened.’9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en960] We are reminded, inevitably, ofthe mission of Giordano Bruno to bring about the Hermetic reform of the world.At last Christian Rosenkreutz returned to Germany. He built a home, meditated atlength about his journey and his philosophy, ‘and reduced them together in atrue memorial’. He also intensified his studies of mathematics and made ‘manyfine instruments’. After five years ‘came again into his mind the wished forreformation … and unwearying, he undertook, with some few who joined with him,to attempt the same.’ We hear at this point of three other bretheren – ‘BrotherG. V.’, ‘Brother J. A.’, and ‘Brother J. O.’ – who C. R. binds ‘unto himself tobe faithful, diligent and secret’:After this manner began the Fraternity of the Rose Cross; first by four personsonly, and by them was made the magical language and writing, with a largedictionary, which we yet daily use to God's praise and glory, and do find greatwisdom therein … 10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en961]Soon afterwards these four founders were joined by four others – ‘Brother B.’,‘Brother G.’, ‘Brother P. D.’, and ‘Brother J. A.’ – ‘so in all they were eightin number, all bachelors and of vowed virginity.’11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en962] The group then ‘collected a bookor volume of all which man can desire, wish or hope for’ – a system of guidancewhich ‘shall unmovably remain unto the world's end’ with the power to open theeyes of the masses of all lands and to make them less passive before ‘the Pope,Mohamed, scribes, artists and sophisters.’12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en963]Thus prepared ‘and able perfectly to discourse of secret and manifestphilosophy’, the eight ‘separated themselves into several countries’ – there todraw aside from amongst the learned those who were worthy to receive theirdoctrines. Like Cathar perfecti who were renowned for their medical skills,these Rosy Cross brothers were to work as doctors curing the sick, and were todo so free of charge. The better to disguise themselves and blend in, they werenot obliged to wear any particular habit ‘but therein to follow the custom ofthe country’. Like Cathar perfecti they were celibate and, again like perfecti,each was to seek out and work with an apprentice, ‘a worthy person who, afterhis decease, might succeed him.’13 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en964]In this way generations passed until ‘none of us had in any manner knownanything of Brother R. C. and of his first fellow bretheren,’ than could begathered from the books of the order. There began to be doubts as to whether thetrue teachings of the original eight had been properly passed down. At thistime, however, and by chance, one of the brothers stumbled upon the long-losttomb of Christian Rosenkreutz himself. It turned out to be a kind of Hermetic‘Hall of Records’ containing all the wisdom necessary to restore the order:We opened the door, and there appeared to our sight a vault of seven sides andcorners, every side five foot broad, and the height of eight foot.14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en965]A permanent light, like ‘another sun’ glowed ‘in the upper part in the centre ofthe ceiling.’ Instead of a tombstone the vault contained a round altar coveredwith a brass plate on which was engraved the following mysterious epitaph:This compendium of the universe I made in my lifetime to be my tomb.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en966]Beneath the brass plate was the dead body of Christian Rosenkreutz, ‘a fair andwise body, whole and unconsumed.’ In his hand he held a parchment book, on thefinal page of which was this eulogy:A grain buried in the breast of Jesus, C. Ros. C. sprung from the noble andrenowned German family of R. C.; a man admitted into the mysteries and secretsof heaven and earth through the divine revelations, subtle cogitations andunwearied toil of his life. In his journeys through Arabia and Africa hecollected a treasure [of knowledge, not gold and worldly riches] surpassing thatof Kings and Emperors, but finding it not suitable for his times he kept itguarded for posterity to uncover … He constructed a microcosm corresponding inall motions to the macrocosm and finally drew up a compendium of things past,present and to come. Then, having now passed the century of years, thoughoppressed by no disease … but summoned by the Spirit of God … he rendered up hisillumined soul …16 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en967]The authors of the Fama claim that they ‘have the knowledge of Jesus Christ’ andthat their philosophy ‘is not a new invention’:Also our building (although one hundred thousand people have very near seen andbeheld the same) shall forever remain untouched, undestroyed, and hidden fromthe wicked world.17 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en968]Finally, and in ringing tones, there comes this statement and prophecy oftremendous changes and the birth of a new order, which the Rosicrucians, withthe treasures of knowledge at their disposal, stand ready to usher in:Europe is with child and will bring forth a strong child, who shall stand inneed of a great godfather's gift.18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en969]THE CONFESSIOPublished in 1615 the Confessio presents itself as a sequel to the Fama andbegins with a condemnation of ‘the East and the West [meaning the pope andMuhammad] blasphemers against our Lord Jesus Christ.’ It then promises that ‘alllearned who will make themselves known to us, and come into our brotherhood,shall find more wonderful secrets thereby than heretofore they did attain unto,and did know, or are able to believe or utter.’19[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en970]Using strange metaphorical language the Confessio next proposes what sounds liketotal revolution in Europe, wiping the slate clean, because ‘posterity will beable only thereby to lay a new foundation and bring truth to light again.’ Thisis argued to be preferable to endless renovations and repairs to ‘the oldruinous building.’20 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en971] The hoped forend result will be that:… the World shall awake out of her heavy and drowsy sleep, and with an openheart, bare-headed, and bare-foot, shall merrily and joyfully meet the newarising Sun …21 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en972]The text continues with an attack on the Church:Like as the mathematician and astronomer can long before see and know theeclipses which are to come, so we may verily foreknow and foresee the darknessof obscurations of the Church … 22 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en973]We are told that ‘the Romish seducers have vomited forth their blasphemiesagainst Christ, and as yet do not abstain from their lies in this clear shininglight.’23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en974] There are also repeatedappeals for proper understanding of the scriptures .24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en975] Finally:We acknowledge ourselves truly and sincerely to profess Christ, condemn thePope, addict ourselves to the true Philosophy, lead a Christian life, and dailycall, entreat, and invite many more into our Fraternity, unto whom the sameLight of God likewise appeareth.25 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en976]The Confessio for the first time provides the reader with the chronology withinwhich the whole story is set: Christian Rosenkreutz is born in 1378 and livesfor 106 years, dying in 1484. His tomb is rediscovered 120 years later – inother words in 1604, exactly 10 years before the publication of the Fama .26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en977]MYSTERY OF THE CHEMICAL WEDDINGA third publication appeared in 1616 that added to the mystery of theRosicrucian Manifestos. Its title is The Chemical Wedding of ChristianRosenkreutz and, like the Manifestos, it describes a secretive order which usesa red cross and red roses as its symbols.27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en978] Now, though, the focus has shiftedto what might be called ‘inner transformation’ – as opposed to the social andreligious transformation heralded in the Manifestos.28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en979]The authors of the Fama and the Confessio have never been firmly identified. Forsome time, however, it has been the concensus of scholars – Frances Yatesbelieved it to be a certainty – that the Chemical Wedding was the work of JohannValentin Andreae, a young Lutheran pastor from Tübingen in Germany.29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en980] Recent research has begun to castsome doubt on this identification, primarily because the Chemical Wedding as itappeared in 1616 is distinctively different from all other surviving writings ofAndreae. As the Hermetic scholar Adam McLean puts it:From what we know of Andreae as an orthodox and eminent Lutheran pastor andacademic, it seems unlikely that he could have devised such a profoundlyesoteric document, which in fact has as its basis many ideas heretical even inProtestant terms.30 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en981]The confusion enters in because Andreae lists a work called The Chemical Weddingamongst a number of short plays – ‘first juvenile efforts as an author’31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en982] – that he wrote while studying atthe University of Tübingen in 1602 and 1603. This early play has not survived.But Andreae moved in esoteric and Hermetic circles, as we shall see, and wasvery much involved with the nascent Rosicrucian movement of Germany,32[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en983] so it was natural for scholars toidentify his Chemical Wedding of 1602/3 with the anonymous Chemical Wedding ofChristian Rosenkreutz, published in 1616. The latter contains references to theRosicrucian Manifestos (1614/15) and to other contemporary matters and so cannotbe identical to the lost 1602/3 text, but the general view is that Andreae musthave updated it prior to publication.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en984]Born in 1586 Andreae would have been 17 in 1603, too young and inexperienced ofthe world, in our view, to have written a work as deep, dark and rich in complexsymbols as The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz. By 1616, when it waspublished, he would have been 30 – a different matter altogether. Even so, if hewas the author, he must not so much have ‘updated’ as completely rewritten thejuvenile version of the play before bringing it out in print – for there isnothing at all of a 17-year-old boy to be seen in the finished work. And evenaccepting that he did completely rewrite it in his maturity, we still confrontthe problem of its ‘heretical’ undertones and its alleged incompatibility withthe rest of Andreae's writings. The issue will probably never be resolved toeveryone's satisfaction unless the lost manuscript of 1602/3 turns up. Meanwhilewe find Adam McLean persuasive when he speculates that:Andreae did in fact write a version of the Chemical Wedding, perhaps a simpleplay or masque … Some years later … one of the ‘Rosicrucian’ fraternity … withwhom Andreae had some connections, might have decided to rework Andreae's early,unpublished play into the complex esoteric allegory we know today.34[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en985]A STRANGE STORYAs to the content of the Chemical Wedding, there is simply not space here for usto do it justice. In English translation the printed text runs to about 90pages, divided into seven chapters each representing a day's journey in a sortof pilgrim's progress. The narrator is Christian Rosenkreutz himself who, thereader will recall, was said in the Manifestos to have lived to the age of 106.In the Chemical Wedding his age must be 81 – for we know that he was born in1378 and the story is set in the year 1459. 35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en986]The ‘First Day’ finds C. R. at his table, quietly meditating ‘on the many greatmysteries which the Father of Light, in his majesty, had allowed me toglimpse.’36 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en987] We note in passingthat the phrase ‘Father of Light’ never appears in the Christian Bible, eitherin the Old Testament or in the New Testament.37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en988] In the early centuries of theChristian era, however, it was in common usage amongst Manicheans and Gnosticsas a reference to the God of Goodness, and there was a sect of GnosticChristians whose members called themselves the ‘Sons of Light’.38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en989]Whilst in the depths of his meditation, C. R. is visited by the angelic,glowing, winged figure of ‘a wonderfully beautiful female … dressed all in blue,spangled like the heavens with golden stars.’ She produces a ‘small note’, putsit on the table with a curtsey and immediately flies off into the upperatmosphere blowing loudly on a trumpet.39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en990] When C. R. opens the note he findsit contains an invitation to ‘the wedding of the king’ and a cryptic warningthat he must study himself closely before deciding to accept:If you're not clean enough, The wedding can work ill. Perjure here at yourperil.40 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en991]What kind of wedding is it – one is inclined to ask – that can be perilous toguests who are impure or do not tell the truth? This is an early hint, oneamongst many in the narrative, that we are not in any way dealing with anaccount of real events here, or even with pure fiction, but strictly andexclusively with what Adam McLean calls an ‘esoteric allegory’. It may be saidsafely that the allegory of the wedding is meant to bring to mind something moreof the nature of a quest or personal challenge than a ‘marriage’. Very much inthe same tradition as the quest for the Holy Grail, the ordeals and moraldilemmas that the guests confront over the coming ‘Days’, and in which they mustcooperate to complete a complex alchemical operation, seem themselves to be partof a subtle process of purification and transformation.Like the Grail Quest, the Chemical Wedding is often claimed as a document ofesoteric Christianity. But as Adam McLean asks and observes:Where is the Christian message? What is described seems more like an ancient‘mystery initiation’ than a Christian religious experience.41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en992]Still on the First Day of his quest, the octogenarian Christian Rosenkreutz doesas the wedding invitation has warned him to do. He observes himself, bothinwardly and outwardly, with absolute honesty and finds himself wanting:The more I pondered, I could see that there was nothing in my head but a greatwant of sense and blindness in esoteric matters … I also found that my physicallife, outward conduct, and brotherly love towards my neighbour were far frombeing purged and pure enough. I was aware of fleshly desires, which aim only forreputation and worldly show, not for the well-being of others; I was alwaysthinking how I could use my skills for my own immediate benefit, for buildingmany splendid things, for making an everlasting name in the world, and othersuch materialistic thoughts …42 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en993]It is interesting that the two matters for which C. R. reproaches himself are(1) his esoteric blindness and lack of inner gnosis and (2) his worldly andmaterialistic behaviour. Regardless he decides that he will attend the wedding.Dressed in a white linen coat with a blood-red belt bound crosswise across hisshoulders, and wearing four red roses in his hat, he proceeds on his journey.Thus ends the First Day.On the ‘Second Day’ Rosenkreutz enters a great forest and comes eventually to aclearing. There he is offered ‘the choice of four paths, by all of which you mayreach the royal castle, if you do not fall by the wayside.’ One is short butdangerous, another long and winding – and so on. Eventually C. R. finds his wayto the castle, where other guests are already gathered. A beautiful virginappears and makes a portentous announcement reminding the guests that they arenot supposed to be here unless properly prepared:Tomorrow every one of youUpon the balance will be weighed …He who dares beyond his powersWould have done better not to come.We wish you all the best.43 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en994]We will not take the reader step by step through the remaining ‘Five Days’ ofthe Chemical Wedding, which indeed feature (on the ‘Third Day’) a symbolic‘weighing of the guests’ in which some are ‘successful’ and some are not.Varying degrees of punishment await those who prove ‘too light in the balance’and the worst offenders (‘who could not even outweigh a single weight’) areslaughtered.44 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en995] Many elements ofthis curious scene are strongly reminiscent of the stage in the afterlifejourney known as the ‘weighing of the soul’ as it is described in the ancientEgyptian Book of the Dead – a text of the second millennium BC that no one inthe 17th century is supposed to have been able to read. And other elements ofthe landscape of the Chemical Wedding also have ancient Egyptian resonances, topick at random – a phoenix, the god Hermes, a royal staircase with 365 spiralsteps, the ‘House of the Sun’, scenes of death, a rebirth ritual (‘We had todrudge away on this island until we had done everything necessary for revivingthe beheaded bodies’45 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en996]), apyramid, a pentagon, various pieces of equipment needed in the quest including aladder, a rope and wings, an egg produced by alchemical processes, a bird thatgrows at miraculous speed, resurrection of the king and queen, and elevation ofcertain of the guests to the status of ‘Knights of the Golden Stone’.Towards the end of the ‘Seventh Day’ Christian Rosenkreutz writes his name in agreat book above the following enigmatic motto:The height of knowledge is to know nothing.46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en997]BRUNO, CAMPANELLA AND THE ROSICRUCIANSIt seems to us to be beyond serious doubt that a great allegory of death,rebirth and spiritual transformation lies at the heart of the Chemical Weddingand that Adam McLean is right to compare the entire process to an ancientmystery initiation. At the successful completion of the Seventh Day we areperhaps to understand that the initiate, now an adept – literally a ‘perfect’ –has attained that gnosis by means of which ‘the soul can escape its bondage tomaterial existence.’47 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en998] If so, nomatter how different the mode of expression, the primary concerns of theChemical Wedding can be seen to be essentially the same as those of theAlexandrian Hermetists, the Gnostics, the Manicheans, the Paulicians, theBogomils, the Cathars – and all those on the great chain of heresy that we havetraced in the preceding chapters. Since the Chemical Wedding can, in a sense, beregarded as the ‘statement of faith’ of the elusive Rosicrucian order, the clearimplication is that their general reformation of the world was to be of adistinctly Hermetic nature.48 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en999]Reinforcing this is the fact that even a cursory examination of the Fama, theCon fessio and the Chemical Wedding makes it quickly evident – whatever theiridentity – that our shadowy ‘Rosicrucians’ were using a strong mixture ofHermetic magic, Gnosis, Cabala and alchemy in a Christian framework. In short,these pamphlets that caused such a stir at the time were seeking not only tobring about a ‘Rosicrucian’ reformation of the world but also to do so with allthe intellectual weaponry of the Hermetic magi such as Pico della Mirandola,Bruno and Campanella. Even more curiously, through their connection with JohannValentin Andreae, the ‘brothers’ were also involved in the conception of autopian city-society they called Christianopolis – a sort of microcosm of theworld governed by Hermetic statesmen-priests49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1000] – that very much resembledCampanella's Civitas Solis. With such similar terminology, imagery andobjectives, it is justified to ask whether this ‘Rosicrucian’ movement might notsomehow have been rooted in Bruno's long sojourns in Germany between 1586 and1591 (see Chapter Eleven) as well as the smuggling of advance copies ofCampanella's Civitas Solis into that country – events that occurred in the yearsimmediately before the Rosicrucian Manifestos first appeared.During Bruno's Inquisition in Venice in 1592 (before his case was referred toRome, see Chapter Eleven), his Venetian ‘pupil’ and betrayer, the faithlessMocenigo, reported that the Nolan had plans to found a new philosophical sect inGermany. Other witnesses said that the sect existed, that Bruno had named it theGiordanisti and that it much appealed to the Lutheran heretics in Germany. Suchtestimonies led Frances Yates to wonder whether these rumoured ‘Giordanisti’could have had any connection with the unsolved mystery of the origins of theRosicrucians who, she reminds us ‘are first heard of in Germany in the early17th century, in Lutheran circles.’50[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1001] If such a connection exists atall, however, as Yates discovered, it is as yet far too murky and faint for usto be sure of. Nonetheless, sufficient hints and clues exist for her to suggestthat ‘Rosicrucian aspirations after a universal reform in a Hermetic context maywell owe something to Bruno as well as to Campanella.’51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1002] And although no direct connectionhas so far been confirmed between Bruno and the Rosicrucian movement in Germany,there is at least strong circumstantial evidence of a connection betweenCampanella and the Rosicrucians.THE GRADUAL UNVEILING OF THE CITY OF THE SUNCampanella's great work, Civitas Solis, the ‘City of the Sun’, was writtenduring his long years of incarceration between 1599 and 1627. The earliestprinted edition, in Latin, was published in Frankfurt, Germany in 1623.52[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1003] However Campanella's first draftof the manuscript – in Italian, not Latin – was complete as early as 1602, andhas survived (although it was not published until 1904).53[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1004] By 1613, and possibly as early as1611,54 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1005] the manuscript copy ofanother draft had been smuggled out of Campanella's prison by one of hisdisciples and regular visitors – the Lutheran Tobias Adami as we saw in ChapterTwelve. We know that Adami took the smuggled manuscript to the city of Tübingenin southern Germany,55 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1006] where atthe time lived Johann Valentin Andreae, a scholar with undeniable Hermetic andRosicrucian connections and the possible author, or part-author of The ChemicalWedding of Christian Rosenkreutz.Did Adami pass Campanella's manuscript to Andreae and to others in theproto-Rosicrucian circle in Tübingen? It seems highly likely. In which case –since the Fama and the Confessio did not appear until 1614 and 1615, while theChemical Wedding appeared in 1616 – there is time enough to allow, as Yatessuggests, for a Campanellan influence on ‘Rosicrucian aspirations after auniversal reform.’ The link is tightened, Yates reveals, by the presence amongstAndreae's close friends of another of Campanella's German Lutheran disciples – aman called Wilhelm Wense.56 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1007]Dame Frances Yates has not been alone in noting the implications for ourunderstanding of the Rosicrucian phenomenon of these behind-the-scenesconnections involving Campanella, Adami, Wilhelm Wense and the enigmatic JohannValentin Andreae. Christopher McIntosh similarly argues that Campanella's‘utopian work, Civitas Solis, which describes an ideal society ruled over byHermetic priests … helped create the atmosphere in which the RosicrucianManifestos were produced.’57 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1008] Itwould appear that Wense had even suggested to Andreae that the society the‘Christian Union’ which Andreae wanted to create in Germany should be calledCivitas Solis.58 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1009]In 1619, four years before the first (1623) publication of Civitas Solis but atleast six years after the manuscript had reached Lutheran circles in Tübingen,Andreae was to publish a book of his own expounding the virtues ofChristianopolis – a special kind of utopian city. There can be little doubt thatCampanella's Hermetic-Christian vision of an ideal state was its inspiration.THE UNION OF THE THAMES AND THE RHINEThe central image of The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz is themarvellous, magical wedding of a mythical king and queen. In February 1613,three years before the publication of the Chemical Wedding, a fabulous andalmost mythical wedding did in fact take place …The story begins on 24 March 1603 when Queen Elizabeth I of England died inRichmond Palace. Her life had been childless, and so the kingdom passed to herclosest cousin, King James Stuart VI of Scotland, who was crowned James I ofEngland at the age of 37. He was naturally followed into England by many loyalnoblemen and gentry of his original Scottish court. With them they brought notonly their traditional clannish sense of bonding in elite male fraternities butalso the budding seed of what was eventually to become the most powerful andinfluential secret society of modern times.James I was a staunch Protestant who, on the death of his illustrious cousin,found himself transformed from the king of a small, relatively poor country –Scotland – to the supreme head of one of the most powerful states in the world.His personality, it seems, was crude and ill-mannered, leaving much to bedesired. Though married he apparently harboured an acute disdain for women, andpreferred to spend his time in the company of men – with whom, it was inevitablyrumoured, he was not averse to enjoying occasional sexual relationships.59[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1010]An all-out biblical fanatic of the worst sort, James I was fired by an adamantbelief in his own ‘divine right’ to rule. In practice, however, he was to proverather mediocre as a king and a statesman, some might even say, a failure. TheEnglish mistrusted the peace that he had struck with their traditional mortalenemy Spain, and were perplexed when he began to involve himself in anincreasingly intimate relationship with the Spanish ambassador.But all was forgiven in late 1612, when James I announced the marriage of hisdaughter, who bore the evocative name of Elizabeth, to the young and much lovedGerman Protestant Prince Frederick V, the elector of the Lower Palatinate. Aswell as the high romance, the glamour, the excitement and the anticipation ofthe impending event (then, as now, the masses loved royal weddings) this moveseemed to confirm James I’s commitment to the Protestant cause. Many in Englandand elsewhere even began to hope that he might, after all, champion and defendthe Protestants of Europe as Elizabeth I had before him. And such hopes, quitenaturally, were focussed in particular on what might happen in Germany, the hubof the Protestant Reformation.The elector of the Lower Palatinate was a sensitive, handsome and very gentleyoung man. He had received a refined French education at the famous Universityat Heidelberg, an enchanting university-city that was the seat of the LowerPalatinate, and in 1610 had succeeded his father, Frederick IV, a staunchCalvinist and one of the founders of the German Protestant Union. This was acoalition of German Protestant principalities whose objective was to resist theCatholic League and the power of the Hapsburgs by forging alliances amongstthemselves in Germany and also with foreign sympathisers such as the FrenchHuguenots under Henry of Navarre, and the English Protestants.There were, in fact, two Palatinates, the Upper Palatinate in northern Bavariaand the Lower or Rhine Palatinate located on both sides of the middle Rhine.Since medieval times the Palatine rulers had served as stewards of royalterritory in the absence of the Hapsburg emperors, and eventually obtained theright to be among the electors of new emperors, hence their title of ‘electors’.When the Palatinate adopted Calvinism in the 1560s, these principalitiessuddenly became the bulwark of the Protestant cause in Germany. As elector ofthe Lower Palatinate, Frederick V symbolised Protestant resistance against theCounter-Reformation spurred by the Catholic League under the Hapsburgs, andquite naturally his marriage to the daughter of James I was perceived as a greatstrengthening of this resistance.When Frederick arrived in England in the autumn of 1612 he made a huge positiveimpression on the English court. The young Princess Elizabeth fell deeply inlove with him at first sight, and he, too, with her. It all promised to be theultimate fairy-tale of the century. Frederick was invested with the Order of theGarter, and everyone in the realm rejoiced at the prospect of the fabulouswedding and of the great things that would come from this union.The wedding took place on 14 February, St. Valentine's Day, 1613, amid lavishfestivities along the River Thames near London. And two months later, on 25April, the sparkling royal couple left for Germany, and set up court at themagnificent Heidelberg Castle in the Lower Palatinate.DEE AND CHRISTIAN ROSENKREUTZWe shall recall from Chapter Eleven that in 1583, the year Giordano Brunoarrived in England, the famous Elizabethan astrologer, conjuror andmathematician, John Dee, was preparing to leave. The Polish prince, AlbertLaski, who had been amongst Bruno's audience at Oxford, had invited Dee and hisfamily to join him at his home in Trebona, Poland, and Dee had accepted. Deealso took along his young clairvoyant assistant, Edward Kelly.After leaving England in October 1583 Dee and his little party first stayed inTrebona for a year and then travelled extensively through Poland and Bohemia,from town to town, performing mystical séances and conjurations for the nobilityuntil 1587. Dee and his family then returned to England, passing through Germanyand Holland, but Kelly decided to stay in Poland. He was eventually killed in1593 in an accident while trying to escape from a German prison where he hadbeen jailed for heresy.Back in England Dee feel into deep poverty, and was nearly destitute whenElizabeth I took pity on him and appointed him chancellor of St. Paul'sCathedral. A few years later Dee was appointed warden of Manchester College,where he stayed until the death of Elizabeth I in 1603. Under James I, however,Dee lost all influence with the crown and all its support as well. He died in1608, in an awful state of poverty, at the age of 81.Curiously the character of Christian Rosenkreutz in the Chemical Weddingpublished eight years later, is also 81 years old. Remembering how theRosicrucian Manifestos boast that the brothers communicate with one another incoded language, we suggest this may not be a coincidence. The author, whoever hewas, may have been trying to express a deliberate, if cryptic, link between Deeand Christian Rosenkreutz, the legendary founder of the Rosicrucian movement.This is speculation, of course. But what lends it some credibility is the factthat many scholars believe the roots of the Rosicrucian movement do go back longbefore the publication of the Fama and the Confessio in 1614 and 1615 – perhapseven all the way back to Germany and Bohemia in the 1580s, right after JohnDee's visit to those countries. Dame Frances Yates, the greatest scholar of thisfield, certainly thought she could detect Dee's influence. This might havefollowed directly from his own travels in Germany and Bohemia. Or it could havecome later and indirectly through the retinue of English scholars and artists,many of whom may have been influenced by Dee, who followed Elizabeth Stuart toher new home at Heidelberg Castle and then later on at Prague in Bohemia.60[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1011]Such influences were too well hidden for any scholar to expect to uncover themfully today. All we can say for sure is that the Rosicrucian phenomenon of 1614– 16 followed closely on from the ‘alchemical marriage’ in 1613 of Frederick Vand Elizabeth Stuart. Taken together with other signs of the times, these eventsconspired to raise hope of an end to the age-old system of religious andpolitical intolerance that had ruled Europe for so long and seemed to offer thepromise of a new dawn.THE ROSICRUCIAN INVESTMENT IN FREDERICK VTo ‘build the City of the Sun’, in Hermetic parlance, requires the patronage andparticipation of powerful secular leaders. Without their support the greatsocial, political and religious changes that the process requires – not tomention the architecture – are just impossible dreams. With this in mind it is,in our view, quite possible that Frederick of the Palatinate, head of theProtestant Union in Germany, was deliberately groomed by Rosicrucian andHermetic thinkers to play the key secular role in their grand plan for Europe –the same role that they may also have had in mind for Henry IV of France beforehis assassination in 1610. The added frisson in Frederick's case was hismarriage to the king of England's daughter – taken by many as a token of futureEnglish military intervention against the Hapsburgs and the Catholic League.Frederick's most trusted chief advisor at Heidelberg was Prince Christian ofAnhalt, a keen student of esoteric and mystical topics, particularly alchemy,Cabala and the occult. He was the patron of the German alchemist Oswald Croll,who was his physician, and he was a close friend of Peter Rosenberg, a wealthylandowner with estates around Trebona whose brother, Villem Rosenberg, had actedas host to John Dee during his stay there a few years before.61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1012] Even more striking is the factthat one of Prince Christian's closest relatives, Prince Augustus of Anhalt, iscredited with having published – in 1605, nine years before the Fama – theearliest known reference to the Rosicrucian brotherhood.62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1013]It was under Prince Christian's influence that the Heidelberg court, as well asFrederick and Elizabeth's later court in Prague, came to be frequented by manywell-known Rosicrucian sympathisers – amongst them the famous English Hermeticphilosopher Robert Fludd, a pupil of John Dee, and the German alchemist MichaelMaier. Interestingly, Prince Christian is also known to have been in closecontact with the great Italian reformer Paolo Sarpi, the latter a Venetiantheologian and statesman who, other than his intensely anti-Catholicismsentiment, also wanted to turn Venice into an independent Protestant republic.63[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1014] Sarpi was in turn a close friendof Galileo and is often credited with having been the first to introduce to thisgreat astronomer the primitive optical long-distance sighting devices –telescopes – that were then being developed in Holland.Prince Christian was 45 years old when the young Frederick, then barely 14,became elector of the Palatinate. Frederick and Elizabeth were still only 17when they married and set up court in Heidelberg in 1613. Having previouslyserved under Frederick IV, and with enormous experience of diplomacy, it waseasy for Prince Christian to become a father figure to the impressionable royalcouple – and there seems little doubt that it was he who promoted Frederick V asthe figurehead of a great and imminent universal reformation. It is known thatPrince Christian even harboured the hope that his protégée might become thefirst Protestant Holy Roman emperor after the anticipated overthrow of theCatholic Hapsburgs.In August 1619 the throne of Bohemia, which the rebellious nobility of Pragueconsidered to be an elective rather than a hereditary title, was offered toFrederick. Against the sound advice of the union of Protestant princes and thebeseeching of his own mother he unwisely accepted the offer and late inSeptember 1619 he and his English wife left Heidelberg Castle and headed forPrague. When the news reached England, it was greeted with huge enthusiasm bythe public – almost as though a new or ‘reincarnated Queen Elizabeth’ hadmanifested herself in central Europe in defence of Protestantism. This time,moreover, a splendid young prince was to be found at her side bearing the titleof head of the Protestant Union and protected by his powerful father-in-law,James I.It was all a grave mistake, for James I had absolutely no intention ofjeopardising the precarious peace that England then enjoyed with Spain and thus,indirectly, with the Catholic League and the Hapsburgs.In these adverse political and military circumstances – which surely he musthave been aware of – historians have often wondered why Frederick V accepted thecrown of Bohemia at all? What was it that prompted him to take such a huge risk?Explaining this very matter to an uncle, Frederick himself stated in a letterthat he believed it to be his ‘divine calling which I must not disobey … my onlyend is to serve God and his Church.’64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1015]By God's ‘Church’ Frederick presumably meant the Bohemian or Calvinist-ReformedChurch. But it is not altogether impossible that his idea of his ‘divinecalling’ might have encompassed a much larger ‘mission’ extending beyondBohemia, beyond Germany and even beyond Calvinism. Through Prince Christian ofAnhalt, the Rosicrucian and Hermetic influences that are likely to have reachedthe young elector all envisaged a great and imminent religious and culturalreformation of the world – nothing less than a new Hermetic golden dawn formankind that was about to break very soon. Those who promulgated such ideasbelieved that the instrument to bring this about was an ancient and secretknowledge that had recently been rediscovered – a knowledge that they hadunderstood and that was to be found in the Hermetic writings, in the CabalisticHebraic texts, and in the old sciences of alchemy and natural magic.All those who promoted such ideas – at high risk to their freedom and lives –were also seeking an enlightened monarch or prince to bring about this greatuniversal reform and advancement of learning. It was expected that he would doso from the heart of a utopian republic or ‘city’ ostensibly named Civitas Solis(Campanella), Christianopolis (Andreae) or, as we shall soon see, New Atlantis(Bacon) or even New Jerusalem. It was visualised as a wonderful and magicalHermetic-Christian state ruled by a ‘solar’ king and governed by his wise andlearned priest-scientists, priest-philosophers or magi, set at the veryepicentre of the known world.What better location, then, than the central European state of the Palatinate,ruled by an enlightened prince, a chivalrous knight of the Order of the Garter,who had just married a wonderful and sensitive princess of the blood royal ofEngland? The latter, moreover, had been groomed in the sophisticated andenlightened Baconian and Shakespearian milieu of the Jacobean Renaissance.Better still, she brought with her the clout of her powerful father, James I, tobuttress the great adventure and enterprise ahead.After the unexpected death of Henry IV of France a terrible sense of loss andfrustration befell free thinkers in central Europe until, it seems to us, aclever propaganda campaign using Hermetic-Christian-Cabala changed the directionof the movement. Now it was no longer France but Germany that offered the bestvector for the great reform. As the leading Hermetic scholar Joscelyn Godwinputs it:The hopes of all whose outlook could be described as ‘Rosicrucian’ were pinnedon Frederick: hopes that he could initiate the reform of which the Fama and theConfessio spoke …65 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1016]THE BATTLE OF WHITE MOUNTAINDays after Frederick V was crowned king of Bohemia, his rival, the deposedFerdinand of Hapsburg, was immediately declared Holy Roman emperor – FerdinandII – by the Catholic League. The league then mounted a ferocious crusade againstthe usurper Frederick and the Protestant cause in general. This was the start ofthe terrible Thirty Years War that was to scourge central Europe and kill halfthe population of Germany.Through swift negotiations with his Catholic allies and even the ‘heathen’Turks, Ferdinand II was able to form a powerful coalition against Frederick andhis supposed Protestant allies. Badly organised and weakened by personal feuds,one by one the Protestant princes and the other foreign Protestant powers beganto abandon the elector. The final blow came when it was gradually realised byall that James I, his powerful father-in-law, was not going to send any militarysupport to him. The dismal end to Frederick's short reign was now imminent.On 8 November 1620, a force of 26,000 Catholic soldiers belonging to FerdinandII and placed under the command of the brilliant general, the Count of Tilly,marched against the 21,000 strong Protestant force of Frederick which was underthe command of Prince Christian of Anhalt. The two armies met outside Prague ona gentle sloping field known as the Bílá hora – ‘White Mountain’. Within a fewhours Frederick's army had been smashed. Prince Christian was made prisoner ofthe Catholics, and Frederick and Elizabeth barely managed to escape with theirlives, leaving all their belongings behind.Predictably Ferdinand II and the Catholic League took an abominable revenge onthe rebellious Bohemian estates that had preferred Frederick, Protestantism, andperhaps a great deal more. Land and properties were confiscated, 27 leaders ofthe revolt were publicly beheaded and, to the horror of the Protestants,Catholicism was imposed as the only permitted faith in Bohemia. Those whorefused to convert were ordered to leave the country and all their assets wereconfiscated.It is estimated that over a quarter of million Bohemians chose to go intoexile.66 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1017] Many went to Holland,others to England and some even made it to the New World. The beautiful dreamthat Frederick's rule would be the vector for a Europe-wide ‘Rosicrucian’reformation had been proved to be just that – a beautiful dream.But this did not mean that the dream died. It simply shifted its location – toEngland, which many would argue was its natural home (if John Dee was indeed theFather of Rosicrucianism):The opportunity for general reformation and the advancement of learning that theRosicrucian Manifestos had proclaimed … had been lost in Germany through thecollapse of the Frederickian movement. Those who had suffered from that bitterdisappointment [came] to England, and those in England who bitterly regrettedthat the movement had not been supported, welcome[d] them.67[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1018]The previously ‘Invisible College’ of the Rosicrucian brotherhood was about tobecome very visible indeed …"},{"pageContent":"And after the decease of King David, Solomon that was son unto David performedout the Temple his father had begun and had sent after Masons into divers landsand gathered them together so that he had four score thousand workers of stoneand they were named Masons …The Old Charges of Freemasonry, circa 1583 The Legendary history of [Free]masonry, of the actual art of building, isrecounted in certain medieval poems [the Old Charges] … in these writings …architecture is identified with geometry.

Their views of the Roman Catholic Church as a diabolical agency wouldbe identical. Their basic beliefs and theology would be the same. Their asceticlifestyles would be the same.Were our time-travelling pair then to be transferred to an encounter with a 16thor 17th century European Protestant they would discover much less common ground.Although they would share with him a commitment to a simple and unostentatiousform of religion, their basic beliefs and theology would be as different fromhis as they would be from those of a Roman Catholic.But there's an old saying – ‘my enemy's enemy is my friend.’History shows, during their war to the death with the Roman Catholic Church inthe 13th century, that the Cathars cooperated closely with another hereticalsect, the Waldensians (or ‘Vaudois’) founded by one Peter Waldes in Lyons in thelate 12th century.1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1019] In theirsimplicity and austerity, their distrust of sacraments administered by unworthyministers, their opposition to the veneration of saints and relics, and manyother aspects of their religion, these Waldensians were the true forerunners ofthe later Calvinist and Lutheran movements that came to define EuropeanProtestantism. Their argument, in other words, was primarily with the behaviourof the Roman Catholic Church but they accepted most of the tenets of Catholicdoctrine that the Cathars vehemently rejected.2[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1020] Even so the Waldensians wereviolently persecuted by the Catholic authorities and it was in this sharedexperience of persecution, coupled with their shared detestation of ‘Romish’vanity and ostentation, that the Cathars and the Waldensians found common cause.In this book we are tracing the course through history of two interrelatedunderground religions, Gnosticism and Hermeticism.Having survived centuries of persecution following the triumph of literalistChristianity in the Roman Empire, Gnosticism underwent a renaissance in 12thcentury Europe when it found support amongst the ruling barons of thesemi-independent state of Occitania. That renaissance, as we've seen, wasbrought to a bloody end by the Albigensian Crusades in the 13th century –although the Gnostic religion undoubtedly lingered longer in the Balkans untilit was finally snuffed out there by Islam in the 15th century.Meanwhile, Hermeticism – which might be described as Gnosticism's pagan twin –slept in the West for a thousand years before suddenly and spectacularly wakingup again when the Hermetic texts were rediscovered and brought to Florence inthe 15th century. It then enjoyed an amazing and highly enigmatic period ofpapal favour during the 16th century, documented in Chapter Eight, before theVatican finally recognised it for what it was – a deadly heresy that would bringCatholicism to its knees if it could. The Inquisition's renewed interest in thematter, sending a clear signal of its intentions to all who sought to bringabout a ‘general reformation of the world’, was marked by such acts as thetorture and 27-year imprisonment of the Hermetic magus Tommaso Campanella, andthe imprisonment, torture and savage burning in February 1600 of Giordano Bruno,the greatest magus of them all.3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1021]Just as the Cathars had made common cause in the 13th century with theWaldensians, so too it was natural for the Hermetic and Rosicrucian visionarieswho roamed Europe in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries to make common cause withthe Protestants of their time. The principle of my enemy's enemy being my friendstill applied. And just as the Cathars had needed secular political support inorder to become a force to be reckoned with – one that could actually change theworld – so too the Hermetists and Rosicrucians of the 15th, 16th and 17thcenturies needed secular political support, and for the same reason. Only invery exceptional cases – e.g. the ageing Campanella at the court of Louis XIII –were they likely to receive that support from Catholic rulers. Inevitablytherefore we find key Hermetic and Rosicrucian figures turning up repeatedly inareas of Protestant influence – e.g. Bruno's travels in Germany between 1586 and1591 – and congregating in large numbers around Protestant monarchs such asFrederick V, the elector of the County Palatine of the Rhine.Bruno, for one, was as outspokenly honest with his wealthy and influentialProtestant sponsors as he was with everyone else: he was not a Protestant andwould not become one; he sought only their protection and simply wished tocontinue his studies in peace.4 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1022]But we may confidently suppose that other Hermetic free-thinkers preferred toadopt a lower profile and to blend in, as perfectly as possible, amongst theirProtestant hosts. These were uncertain, violent, highly volatile times and,since the terrible destruction of the Cathars, common sense had taught mostheretics the wisdom of ‘invisibility’ – whether they found themselves amongstProtestants or Catholics.Indeed was it not precisely this quality of ‘invisibility’ that was mostemphasised in the Rosicrucian Manifestos? The reader will recall from ChapterTwelve that the Fama speaks of a ‘magical language and writing’ that had beendeveloped by the early Rosicrucian brothers, presumably for secretivecommunications amongst themselves. The Fama additionally reports that thebrothers are distributed about the world and, as a deliberate policy, wear nodistinguishing garments but follow the custom of whichever country they findthemselves in.5 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1023] In other wordsthey blend in – the way, perhaps Johann Valentin Andreae blended in as astraight-thinking Lutheran pastor whilst pursuing his Rosicrucian and Hermeticinterests. It may be a mark of his success as a Rosicrucian ‘invisible’ thateven today we cannot be one hundred per cent certain whether he was ‘just’ aLutheran pastor and academic with some unconventional interests. Or was he, asmost scholars believe, the author of the Chemical Wedding – the Rosicrucianstatement of faith?The Rosicrucian Manifestos speak, ultimately, of the existence of an ‘InvisibleCollege’, working behind the scenes, through existing institutions for themoment, blending-in until the time comes when it can reveal itself to the world.What it seeks is a great general reformation of religion and society. And thoughthe word ‘reformation’ in this context was itself perhaps chosen for itspolitical correctness and acceptability in Protestant circles we are quitecertain that it was not meant in the Protestant sense at all. It's very obviousfrom the Rosicrucian example that, veiled within Protestant religious bodies,organisations and power structures of the early 17th century, there were peoplewhose agenda was much closer to Giordano Bruno's deeply heretical ‘Egyptian’idea of the Hermetic reformation of Europe, and who might yet heed TommasoCampanella's call to build the City of the Sun.EYES TURN TO ENGLAND AND THE NEW WORLDWe saw in the last chapter that on 8 November 1620 the Catholic forces of theHoly Roman Emperor Ferdinand II inflicted a devastating defeat on the Protestantforces of Frederick V, the elector of the Palatinate. The Bohemian estates weredragooned into Catholicism and a quarter of a million Protestant refugees fled,leaving all their worldly goods behind.Amidst the massacres and the streams of refugees generated by this terribleongoing conflict between Catholics and Protestants in central Europe, theopportunistic minds of some Hermetic thinkers would have turned naturallytowards England, that great Protestant kingdom across the Channel. It would havestood out from the general background chaos of the Continent as a place wherethey still might hope to achieve universal reform based on advancement oflearning.Remember that Hermetic philosophers, conditioned by the characteristicsky-ground dualism of the Hermetic texts, were avid star watchers. We cantherefore be sure that they would have been paying attention in December 1603,the year James I was crowned king of England, when there was an impressiveconjunction of the planets Saturn and Jupiter, seen by astrologers to presage anew age.6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1024] It was in the followingyear, 1604, that the ‘opening’ of the tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz, describedin the Fama, supposedly took place, ushering in a renewed cycle of Rosicrucianactivity. That year also witnessed the strange appearance of two new stars inthe constellations of Serpentarius and Cygnus giving rise to a combustiblemixture of huge fears and tremendous hopes.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1025]It's not difficult to understand how Hermeticists and Rosicrucians takingshelter amongst Lutheran and Calvinist Protestants in the beleaguered warzonesof central Europe must have felt in this atmosphere. It should come as nosurprise to learn, therefore, that for some the opening of the Stuart era inEngland was regarded as the foundation of a ‘New Jerusalem’, a land chosen byGod that could lead the world into a new age of universal peace andenlightenment. We saw in the last chapter that such hopes were intensified bythe widespread public perception – though it ultimately proved false – that apowerful alliance between the ‘Rhine and the Thames’, i.e. between ProtestantEngland and Protestant Germany, had been cemented through the marriage ofFrederick V of the Palatinate and Elizabeth of England.But there was also another factor at work, one that must have loomed large inthe collective subconscious of those seeking the great universal reform. Thiswas the recent acquisition by England of vast and virgin territories in theAmericas. A whole new continent had suddenly emerged on the other side of theAtlantic, a sort of ‘New Atlantis’ ready to be colonised by a new breed ofEuropean. Might it not be easier and better, some of these reformers must havethought, to put aside Europe and its religious troubles altogether and to buildinstead, a completely new society on a clean slate in this untarnished ‘newworld’ – a reformed society, furthermore, that could be dedicated to the pursuitof happiness, justice and the advancement of learning?This was the context in which the great English visionary, Francis Bacon, was topublish a series of books that would galvanise the intellectuals of Europe.HERMETIC BACONFrancis Bacon (1561 – 1626) was the son of the Lord Keeper of the Seal ofElizabeth I. At the age of 12 he was sent to Trinity College, Cambridge. At 18,finding himself virtually penniless after his father's death, he turned to law,and by the age of 23 Bacon had managed to win a seat in the House of Commons.Throughout his early career he was disliked by his peers and even distrusted byElizabeth I, but after the queen's death in 1603 he found new royal favour andpatronage under James I. With the king's support, Bacon quickly rose to fame andfortune, first as Lord Chancellor, then as Baron Verulam in 1618 and, finally,as Viscount St. Albans in 1621. However, Bacon's brilliant career in politicswas to end in shame and dejection after he was accused of taking a bribe. Hespent the rest of his life devoted to his writing.It was in 1605, two years after the death of Elizabeth I, that Bacon publishedhis epoch-making book The Advancement of Learning. Still hailed today as acornerstone of education and science, this calm and measured work surveys thestate of early 17th century knowledge and finds it wanting. If more attentionwere paid to research and experimentation, Bacon suggests, we could make muchfaster progress in understanding nature and thus improving the human condition.To this end, in his dedication of the book to his patron James I, he proposesthe establishment of ‘a fraternity in learning and illumination’8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1026] where scholars and the erudite ofall countries could exchange knowledge and ideas for the benefit of humankind:Surely as Nature createth brotherhood in families, and arts mechanical contractbrotherhoods in communities, and the anointment of God superinduceth abrotherhood in kings and bishops, so in learning there cannot but be afraternity in learning and illumination, relating to that paternity which isattributed to God, who is called the father of illumination or lights.9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1027]Let's not forget this was written in 1605, nine years before the publication ofthe Fama, yet the language is plainly Rosicrucian. The ‘fraternity in learningand illumination’ that Bacon wishes for is precisely what the Rosicrucians(though ‘invisible’) later claimed to be. We also note with interest that Baconrefers to God as the ‘father of illumination or lights’. The reader will recallfrom Chapter Thirteen that this same distinctive phrase – the ‘Father of Light’– turns up in The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz, published in 1616.The phrase is not found anywhere in the Christian Bible. It was, however, incommon usage in the early centuries of the Christian era amongst Manicheans andGnostics as a reference to the God of Goodness. Likewise in the Hermetic textsof the same period we find frequent references to the spiritual, immaterial,first and greatest god as the God of Light. In the Pimander for example (a titlethat is itself derived from Peime-n-Ra, meaning the ‘knowledge of Ra’, theEgyptian sun-god) we may read:That Light … is I, even Mind, the first God, who was before the watery substancewhich appeared out of the Darkness.10[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1028]The above passage strikes an association not only between Light and the firstGod but also between both God and Mind. It likewise makes clear, in familiardualistic terms, that all three (Light/Mind/God) are of a spiritual,non-material essence, different from, and preceding the ‘watery substance’, i.e.matter, that ‘appeared out of Darkness.’ These links are reinforced in theAsclepius:Gross matter … is the nutriment of bodies, and spirit is the nutriment of souls.But besides these, there is mind, which is the gift of heaven, and one withwhich mankind alone is blessed … By the light of mind the human soul isillumined.11 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1029]It is precisely this illumination of the human soul by the light of mind thatthe Rosicrucians claimed to be devoted to and that Bacon sought to bring aboutthrough his proposed international ‘fraternity in learning and illumination’.His choice of these particular words in his dedication to James I must,moreover, be understood in the wider context of the times. As the Italianscholar Paolo Rossi points out, the view of Frances Bacon as ‘a modernscientific observer and experimentalist emerging out of the superstitious pastis no longer valid.’12 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1030] Rossi'sresearch, backed up by Frances Yates shows that:It was out of the Hermetic tradition that Bacon emerged, out of the Magia andCabala of the Renaissance as it had reached him via the natural magicians …Bacon's science is still, in part, occult science.13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1031]The same science, natural philosophy and Hermetic magic were also advocated byMarsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Giordano Bruno and theRosicrucians. And what all sought to bring about was a universal revolution inlearning promoted by an elite international fraternity of illuminati.It can't be an accident that a fraternity fitting this description was soon toflourish in the British Isles and eventually to spread around the world: thefraternity of the Freemasons. Nor were we surprised to learn from our friend theMasonic historian Robert Lomas that both Francis Bacon and James I were, in allprobability, Freemasons themselves – associated with the early formation of theso-called Scottish Rite. Indeed it seems that in addition to its obviousHermetic and Rosicrucian content, the language used by Bacon in his dedicationto James I is recognisably ‘Masonic language’ – i.e. a sort of allegoricalsystem of communication used by Freemasons couched in symbolism and secret wordsand fully comprehensible only to initiates.14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1032] Such an idea is, of course,identical to the ‘magical language and writing’ spoken of in the RosicrucianManifestos.15 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1033]All in all there is, in our view, no doubt that Bacon's carefully chosen wordsof 1605 are resonant of Rosicrucian and Masonic influences, suggesting, at thevery least, the presence of a proto-Freemasonic movement within the elite innercircle of the Stuart court.A ROSICRUCIAN CHRISTMAS CARD IN THE NATIONAL RECORDS OF SCOTLANDAt about the time that Francis Bacon was putting the finishing touches to TheAdvancement of Learning, the German alchemist Michael Maier (1568 – 1622), arenowned Rosicrucian thinker, was living in Prague and working as the privatephysician to Emperor Rudolph II. When Rudolph died in 1612 – the year before themarriage of Frederick V of the Palatinate and Elizabeth Stuart – Maier came toEngland. There he met Sir William Paddy, the private physician of James I. Itcannot be confirmed that Maier met the king, but he certainly felt comfortableenough to send him a personal Christmas card – one that, on face value, verymuch appears to associate James I with the Rosicrucian movement.Maier's Christmas card to the king is kept today in the archives of the NationalRecords of Scotland in Edinburgh. It depicts a large rose around which arewritten the words:Greetings to James, for a long time King of Great Britain. By your trueprotection may the rose be joyful.16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1034]This weird card has lead many researchers to suppose that there might haveexisted in England some early form of the ‘Rosicrucian movement’ and that JamesI was seen as its protector by German Rosicrucians like Michael Maier.17[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1035] It's very probable, while he wasin England, that Maier would have met the Hermetic philosopher and Cabalist,Robert Fludd (1574 – 1637), who was then in his late thirties. Although Fluddhad not yet published his own work on the Rosicrucian brotherhood, A CompendiumApology for the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross (1616), he nonetheless was a keen‘Rosicrucian in spirit.’18 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1036]It is certain that the German Rosicrucians must have noted Fludd's defence oftheir fraternity in England because later, in 1618, at the height of Rosicrucianfurore, two more of Fludd's books, History of the Macrocosm and History of theMicrocosm were published in the town of Oppenheim by the firm of Johann Theodorde Bry – who apparently paid handsomely for the privilege.19[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1037] De Bry was also the publisher ofone of Michael Maier's works, Atalanta Fugiens, likewise brought out in 1618,20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1038] and it seems probable that Maierwas the link between Fludd and the Palatinate publisher.Maier remained in England until 1616 and it would have been extraordinary if hehad not met Bacon during this period since they moved within the same circle.What is known with certainty is that Bacon sat down to write a utopian book soonafter Maier's visit which bears the unmistakable imprint of Rosicrucianthinking.THE NEW ATLANTISIn 1627, a year after Bacon died, a manuscript he had been working on turned upamongst his personal papers. Its title was New Atlantis. And like Plato'soriginal story of Atlantis (found in his dialogues, the Timaeus and the Critias)it had been left unfinished. It was also undated but scholars assume Bacon musthave written it soon after the two Rosicrucian Manifestos and the ChemicalWedding had appeared in Germany – i.e. after 1616 – for it contains allegoriesand ideas that are distinctly reminiscent of those documents. 32 The genie of Paris (or Liverty) on top of the Bastille Pillar.

This society is governed by an elite fraternity of scientist-priests whogather within a great college or lodge called Salomon's House. Members includeaccomplished astronomers and geometers, and – surprising in a 17th centurydocument – the builders of aeroplanes and submarines (‘we have some degrees offlying in the air; we have ships and boats for going under water’). They arealso accomplished navigators and seafarers, but secretive and unwilling toreveal their existence: ‘we know well most parts of the inhabitable world, andare ourselves unknown.’Their quest, Bacon tells us, is for ‘the knowledge of the causes, and secretmotions of things’ and it is their mission to ‘nourish God's first creature,which was Light.’ This mission they continuously spread abroad by means of:… twelve that sail into foreign countries under the names of other nations, (forour own we conceal) … These we call Merchants of Light.21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1039]The travels of Bensalem's 12 invisible missionaries ‘nourish the Light’ bypromoting the advancement of learning all around the world – very much theRosicrucian method – and like the original eight Rosicrucians, and theFreemasons, they take an ‘oath of secrecy’ and proceed with discretion in allthings.22 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1040] They travel incognito,doing good deeds gratis like the Rosicrucians. They remain unnoticed andinvisible because they wear the clothing and speak the languages of thecountries they visit – for like the Rosicrucians they communicate easily inevery language. At home in Bensalem they are distinguished by wearing a whiteturban emblazoned with a red cross – the eponymous symbol of the Rosicrucians –and their great ‘seal’ features a representation of ‘cherubim's wings, notspread but hanging down’. The same emblem, Frances Yates has shown, was used inthe Rosicrucian Manifestos.23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1041]We digress for a moment to note that the image of ‘cherubim's wings’ also evokesthe Judaic Ark of the Covenant, surmounted by the winged figures of two goldencherubim, which the Old Testament tells us once stood in the Holy of Holies ofthe fabled Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. Bacon gives us a ‘House of Salomon’located in a place called Bensalem – essentially the same idea. Ben in Hebrewand Arabic means ‘son’ or ‘son of’ – implying in this case, perhaps, a ‘NewSalem’ or New Jerusalem.Though the terms ‘Rose Cross’ or ‘Rosicrucian’ are not to be found anywhere inNew Atlantis, Frances Yates believed it to be ‘abundantly clear that [Bacon]knew the Rose Cross fiction and was adapting it to his own parable’:New Atlantis was governed by R. C. [Rosicrucian] Brothers, invisibly travellingas ‘merchants of light’ to the outside world from their invisible college orcentre, now called Salomon's House, and following the rules of the R. C.Fraternity, to heal the sick free of charge, to wear no special dress. Moreoverthe ‘cherubim's wings’ seal the scroll brought from New Atlantis, as they sealthe Fama. The island has something angelic about it, and its official wore a redcross in his turban.24 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1042]Yates quite correctly pointed out that modern students of Bacon, unfamiliar withthe Rosicrucian literature, would not readily recognise the similarity betweenNew Atlantis and the Rosicrucian Manifestos. But this handicap would not havebeen applicable to the literati of the 17th century to whom the Rosicrucianliterature was widely known. A case in point is an adaptation of Bacon's NewAtlantis, entitled Holy Guide, published by the author John Heydon in 1662. Onthe island of ‘Bensalem’ they had a ‘House of Strangers’, a sort of quarantineor immigration point where new visitors were temporarily kept. In hisadaptation, Heydon has Bacon's official of the House of Strangers speak asfollows: ‘I am by Office, Governor of this House of Strangers … and of the Orderof the Rosie Cross.’ Heydon also refers to Bacon's ‘wise men of the House ofSalomon’ as being ‘wise men of the Society of the Rosicrucians’, and speaks ofthis ‘House of Salomon’ as being one and the same as the ‘Temple of the RosieCross.’25 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1043]A BRIEF EXCURSION TO CONSIDER FREEMASONRYThe case for a link between the Rosicrucians and Bacon's fraternity ofscientist-priests seems unassailable, yet we've seen that what Bacon tells usfrequently supports a link with Freemasonry as well. Might it not be possiblethen that the elite brotherhood he had in mind was all along not the Rosicrucianbrotherhood per se, but rather the up-and-coming ‘speculative’ Masonicbrotherhood which was beginning at exactly this time to insinuate itself intoEngland?Unquestionably, the term ‘House of Salomon’ in relation to an elite and ‘wise’brotherhood is very suggestive of this, whether Bacon intended it to be or not.‘Salomon’ is, in fact, the transliterated French form of ‘Solomon’, thewell-known biblical ‘wise king’ whose famous ‘temple’ (or rather itsreconstruction) is the epicentre of Freemasonic initiation and rituals. Indeed,as Masonic historians very well know, there is nothing more important and moresymbolic to the ideal of Freemasonry that the Temple of Solomon and its‘rebuilding’ in a supposedly spiritual manner. The Temple of Solomon is sointricately bound to Freemasonry that the entrances of many Masonic lodges areflanked by two columns representing the legendary original pillars of Solomon'sTemple called Boaz and Jachin – meaning ‘wisdom’ and ‘power’.26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1044] In the same way the architecturaldesign of Freemasons’ Hall in London, the headquarters of English Freemasonry,is almost certainly to be seen as an allegory of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.For example, the ceiling of the so-called Grand Temple is decorated with scenesand symbols of Solomon's Temple and reliefs on the main entrance door:… are conventionally pictorial, depicting historical events. The three lowerpanels on each door show scenes connected with the building of King Solomon'sTemple in Jerusalem, and the top left and right-hand panels together show theprocession for the Dedication of the Temple. The inscription at the foot isGod's promise to King Solomon as recorded in I Kings, 6:12.27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1045]Here is the passage from I Kings 6:Then the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying: ‘As for this house which youare building, if you are obedient to my ordinances and conform to my preceptsand loyally observe all my commands, then I will fulfil my promise to you, thepromise I gave your father David, and I will dwell among the Israelites andnever forsake my people Israel.’ So Solomon built the Lord's house and finishedit.28 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1046]Last but by no means least is the well-known fact that Scottish Rite Freemasonrysees itself as a revival in some form of the notorious medieval crusading orderof the Knights Templar (so named because it established its headquarters in the12th century on the site of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem). The Templars werecontemporaries of the Cathars and like the Cathars they were ultimatelypersecuted for heresy, imprisoned, tortured and burnt at the stake. We willreturn to their mystery in the next chapter.ISIS IN VIRGINIAWhen Frances Bacon placed his invisible island of Bensalem ‘in the midst of thegreatest wilderness of waters in the world’ he was clearly signalling a locationfar away from his native England and Europe. Could he perhaps have been inspiredby the idea of the Americas, still largely unexplored in the early 17th century?There, after all, lay a real ‘new world’, unburdened as yet by the deep-rootedreligious and social traditions of the old world, where a great experimentmodelled on Masonic or Rosicrucian ideals might have its best hope of successfulimplementation.We note with interest that Bacon was a passionate exponent of Britain'scolonisation and development of its recently acquired North American territoryof Virginia. In 1606 the so-called Virginia Company was granted a royal charterby James I which allowed it virtually unlimited power of government in thecolony. Bacon had been instrumental in the creation of the charter. Bearing thisin mind, it is not surprising that in New Atlantis, Bacon refers to Bensalem asthe ‘Virgin of the World’,29 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1047] thelatter a well-known allegory for Elizabeth I, the ‘Virgin Queen’, and byextension, her new domain of Virginia. But we saw in previous chapters thatthere also exists an important Hermetic text which is called the Kore Kosmou –literally the ‘Virgin of the World’ – in reference to the ancient Egyptiangoddess Isis. In Chapter Eight we quoted a passage from the Kore Kosmou in whichIsis makes the following astro-geographical statement:The earth lies in the middle of the universe, stretched on her back as a humanmight lie facing towards heaven … Her head lies toward the south … her rightshoulder toward the east, and her left shoulder towards the west; her feet liebeneath the Great Bear [north] … But the right holy land of our ancestors [i.e.Egypt] lies in the middle of the earth; and the middle of the human body is thesanctuary of the heart, and the heart is the headquarters of the soul; and that,my son, is the reason why men of this land … are more intelligent [wise]. Itcould not be otherwise, seeing they are born and bred upon Earth's heart.30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1048]Frances Yates makes the point that Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, was associatedby her contemporaries with the constellation of Virgo, the latter identified bythe Greeks as Astraea, a word meaning ‘star’. This name Astraea appears to beconnected to a number of ancient ‘star’ goddesses of the Middle East such asAstarte and Ashtoreth, all probably directly or indirectly stemming from Ast,the ancient Egyptian name for Isis, whose star was Sirius, the Dog Star.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1049] Could this be a hint that, forsome, the image of Elizabeth as the ‘Virgin Queen’ had contained a codedreference to the ‘virgin’ goddess Isis?Such a possibility may not be as far-fetched as it at first appears. For,curiously enough, both ‘Solomon's Temple’ and the ‘Temple of Isis’ makeappearances in the work of Sir Edmund Spenser, a contemporary of Francis Bacon.A close associate of the enigmatic Dr. John Dee,32[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1050] Spenser was the author of theFaerie Queen, written between 1580 and 1590, a panegyric to Queen Elizabeth Iand her imperial reform of the world. In it the celebrated poet refers to ‘Houseof Alma’, imagined as being an architectural allegory, in microcosm, of themacrocosmic world. The idea is strongly reminiscent of a statement made ageneration later in the Fama (published in 1614) where we read that in theclosing years of his life Christian Rosenkreutz ‘constructed a microcosmcorresponding in all motions to the macrocosm.’33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1051]The whole notion of such correspondences between macrocosm and microcosm, skyand ground, above and below, is intensely Hermetic. Not surprisingly, therefore,Alastair Fowler, an acknowledged expert on Spenser, has discovered that theFaerie Queen contains a complex system of numerology as well as an ‘astral’ orplanetary pattern within its central theme.34[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1052] Frances Yates goes further todeduce that the mysterious ‘House of Alma’ encodes, by means of allegory andnumerology, the proportions of the Temple of Solomon.35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1053] Another Elizabethan scholar,professor Angus Fletcher, sees a hint of Hermetic-Egyptian magic in Spenser'slegend of the beautiful, noble and chaste lady-knight Britomart (an allusion toElizabeth I), where the magician Merlin interprets the ‘vision of Britomart’ asbeing the ‘Temple of Isis’.36 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1054]Perhaps we should also note in passing that King Solomon is said in the book ofKings to have built a ‘house’ for his wife, an Egyptian princess, who, as adaughter of the pharaoh, would automatically have been identified by the ancientEgyptians with the goddess Isis:Then Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up to the City of David [Jerusalem] toher own house which he had built for her.37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1055]ANTILIAN INTRIGUESThe possibility that the newly colonised territories of Virginia were somehowpart of the Rosicrucian and Hermetic dream of universal reform in a utopiansetting may have been detected by the historian and researcher, Ron Heisler.38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1056] In an in-depth investigation intoMichael Maier's sojourn in England between 1612 and 1616, Heisler discoveredthat ‘in Maier's associations there is a pattern of an unexpected dimension.’This pattern emerges from a series of close contacts that Maier established inEngland with individuals who were all related in one way or another to theVirginia Company – a corporation of wealthy men whose royal charter, we sawabove, had been drafted by Bacon.Heisler's research reveals that when Maier published his first work in England,Arcana arcanissima, he personally sent copies to various notables, including SirThomas Smith and a certain Dr. Francis Anthony, both of whom were to becomedeeply involved with the running of the Virginia Company. Indeed Thomas Smithwas its treasurer and Dr. Anthony became a member of its committee in 1619.Others involved with the company, such as its legal advisor John Selden, and thewriter George Sandys, also seem to have had a special interest in Maier and hisideas.39 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1057] All this led Heisler tosuspect that the Rosicrucian reformer's Atalanta Fugiens, published in 1617,‘may have been deeply inspired by the utopian vision of America.’40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1058]There is another connection with the Rosicrucian movement and the Americancolony of Virginia which might shed more light on this intriguing problem. Inhis remarkable study The Tessera of Antilia, scholar Donald R. Dickson presentsevidence concerning the existence of a ‘utopian brotherhood’ known as Antilia (aname sometimes used in medieval times to refer to Atlantis). The brotherhood wasapparently inspired by the Rosicrucian Manifestos and by ‘Baconian beliefs inexperimental science as a key to prosperity.’41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1059] To this end the brothers wishedto purchase a small island in the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic on which to foundtheir utopian society. Separately they also considered emigrating en masse toVirginia and establishing themselves there instead.42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1060] It is obviously not irrelevantthat our old friend Johann Valentin Andreae, the suspected author of TheChemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz, was a key participant in theBrotherhood of Antilia.43 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1061]All this very much suggests, if not actually confirms, that the utopian visionof the New World, and perhaps more specifically of Virginia in North America,was modelled or inspired by the Rosicrucian programme as set out in theManifestos as well as by Francis Bacon's New Atlantis. Also caught up in theblend was Freemasonry, that very real, visible and influential brotherhood,still with us today, that was launched on its present course on English soil inthe early 17th century, right after the Rosicrucian scare …BEFORE FREEMASONRY CAME OUTThe origins of modern Freemasonry are veiled behind such a mass of legends andpseudo-history that the subject has become a true nightmare for even the mostdedicated of researchers. The problem lies in the fact that today Freemasonsdefine themselves as a ‘society with secrets’ whereas once, and no one actuallyknows for how long, they were a secret society that went to great lengths to be‘invisible’. We've noted before that successful secret societies are, bydefinition, hard to trace in the historical record.Freemasonry as a recognised institution originated in Britain in 1717 with theformation of the Grand Lodge of England, an event that is documented in thesecond edition of the Constitutions of Freemasons published by James Anderson in1738.44 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1062] But all this tells us isthe moment when the former secret society publicly declared its existence,thereafter becoming visible – though still a society with secrets.In 1722, sixteen years before Anderson's Constitutions appeared, a brother namedJ. Roberts helpfully published a compilation of the so-called Old Charges ofFreemasonry, also known as the ‘Gothic Manuscripts’. These, as the namessuggest, are a collection of old manuscripts – some of which date from the late14th century – in which is given a ‘history’ of the Craft of Freemasonry.45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1063] According to the manuscripts, theorigins of Freemasonry go back to the antediluvian patriarch Lamech who livedbefore Noah's Flood. To Lamech's three sons – Jabal, Jubal and Tubal – and onedaughter called Naamah, is accredited the invention of all the essential‘crafts’ on which civilisation is based. We are told that Jabal was the inventorof geometry, Jubal invented music, Tubal invented the smelting trades, andNaamah was the inventor of weaving.46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1064] Knowing that one day God wouldpunish humankind for its sins with a cataclysm of flood and fire they tookprecautions to write down all their learning on two huge pillars made of stoneso that their discoveries would not be lost to mankind forever but could berecovered by the survivors. As the Old Charges inform us:The one stone was called marble that cannot burn with fire. The other was calledlateras that cannot drown with water. Our intent is now to tell you truly howand in what manner these stones were found whereon these crafts were written.The Greek Hermenes that was son unto Cush, and Cush was son unto Shem who wasson unto Noah – this same Hermenes was afterwards called Hermes the Father ofWise Men, and he found out the two pillars of stone wherein the sciences werewritten and taught them forth … 47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1065]The ‘Greek Hermenes’ is understood to be, of course, Hermes (the Thoth of theEgyptians and the Mercury of the Romans). As for ‘Hermes the Father of WiseMen’, there can be little doubt that this is reference to Hermes Trismegistus.The rest of the ‘history’ in the Old Charges consists of a very convoluted andcircuitous narrative that passes through Babylon, the coming of Abraham to Egypt(whence ‘he taught the Egyptians the seven sciences’) and finally brings us tothe most important moment in the Masonic story – the building of Solomon'sTemple in Jerusalem. We are told that through the construction of thismagnificent edifice ‘the worthy Craft of Masons was confirmed in the country ofJerusalem.’48 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1066]From there the Old Charges hop, skip and jump through space and time to try andshow how this ‘worthy Craft of Masons’ was brought into Europe via France andfinally to England in the ‘time of St. Alban’.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1067] Perhaps not totally unrelated isthe curious fact that Francis Bacon, at the peak of his career, was granted thetitle of Viscount St. Albans by James I – thus linking him, in name at least, tothis strange genealogy of Freemasonry in Britain.We also note with interest that the Old Charges cast Hermes, the ‘Father of WiseMen’, as the finder and repromulgator of lost knowledge. Though the effect maynot be intentional this is a scenario that does very much call to mind therediscovery of the Hermetic writings in 1460 and their subsequentrepromulgation. We saw in Chapter Eight that Marsilio Ficino and hisintellectual successors, including men like Giordano Bruno and TommasoCampanella more than a century later, really believed that the lost ‘magicalreligion’ or ‘science’ of the Egyptians had been rediscovered and felt stronglythat it should be ‘taught forth’.AN INVISIBLE COLLEGE IN DANGEROUS TIMESOver two decades James I’s extremely unpopular and confusing foreign policy, aswell as his authoritarian attitude and contempt for Parliament, had created adeep and dark mood of discontent in England. When he died in 1625 he wassucceeded by his cultivated but weak and somewhat unstable son, Charles I, whowas destined to lead the monarchy into a headlong collision with Parliament andwith the people. Disaster loomed ahead.The new monarch pursued the same unpopular foreign policy as his father andproved to be even more tyrannical and dictatorial. His early marriage to theFrench Catholic Princess Henrietta Maria, the sister of King Louis XIII, did notgo down well with the Puritanism that pervaded in the House of Commons. But mostof all it was Charles I’s mismanagement of the new war with Spain and France,and his abusive raising of funds through illegal taxations to finance a war inScotland also, that finally brought the Parliamentarians to quasi-open revolt in1640.The unthinkable rumours of civil war in England were everywhere. These wereextremely dangerous times for everyone. The Thirty Years War was still raging incentral Europe, Spain and France were at war with England, and in England itselfthe monarchy and Parliament were at serious odds. Mistrust and treachery hadbecome the norm, and one had to be exceedingly prudent even to survive, letalone to prosper, in this highly perilous and volatile environment. The state ofgeneralised distrust and chaos also created a need amongst certain groups insociety – intellectuals, the elite gentry and the military for example – for aneutral forum in which they could safely exchange views on politics, religionand science. It would much appear that the network and system of Masonic lodges,veiled by their multifarious rituals and screening system of recruitment and,above all, secrecy, may have provided just the right structure to satisfy such aneed.Operative, and possibly even a form of ‘speculative’ (i.e. esoteric, as opposedto strictly practical) Freemasonry had long existed in Scotland, probably sincethe late 15th century.50 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1068] As timepassed an acception system was introduced that allowed the recruiting of thosemen of stature and position in society who were not necessarily engaged in theoperative stone-masonry, building and architectural trades.51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1069] This ‘acception’ system wasalmost certainly the precursor to the ‘speculative’, i.e. non-operative,enrolment system of the modern society of Freemasons. It would also much appearthat acception was brought into England with the coming of the Stuart dynasty.Now, with the English Civil War looming ahead, it conveniently provided aready-made network through the lodges in which the accepted English elite couldmeet in secrecy, in brotherly friendliness and within a liberal atmosphere – thewhole veiled in rituals and symbolism that were intended to bond together menfrom different backgrounds but with similar social goals and spiritualaspirations.Open parliamentary rebellion finally came in 1642. After a failed attempt toarrest five members of Parliament, Charles I and his Royalist supporters quitLondon and set up court-in-exile at Oxford, that traditional hub of elitistintellectuals and scholars. It was there, in the following years, that a strangefraternity of literati began to meet, calling themselves – evocatively – the‘Invisible College’. The earliest surviving written reference to this mysteriousInvisible College comes from the celebrated physicist, Robert Boyle ( 1627 –1691 ), in a letter he wrote to his tutor in France in 1646. In this letterBoyle states that he is now diligently applying himself to ‘natural philosophy’based on the principles of ‘our new philosophical college’ and requests certainbooks from his tutor that ‘will make you extremely welcome to our InvisibleCollege.’52 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1070] A few months later,in 1647, Boyle again mentions the Invisible College in a letter to a friend,saying that,The cornerstones of the Invisible or (as they term themselves) the PhilosophicalCollege, do now and then honour me with their company … [These are] men of socapacious and searching spirits, that school-philosophy is but the lowest regionof their knowledge … [They are] persons that endeavour to put narrow-mindednessout of countenance, by the practice of so extensive a charity that it reachesunto everything called man, and nothing less than a universal goodwill cancontent it. And indeed they are so apprehensive of the want of good employment,that they take the whole body of mankind to their care.53[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1071]The term ‘Invisible College’, as well as the description of its activities andconcerns given above, immediately brings to mind, of course, the InvisibleCollege of the Rosicrucian brotherhood. Also the lofty intellectual and humanequalities of the college brothers, to which Boyle alludes, are, as we saw in theprevious chapter, the very same qualities attributed to the Rosicrucian brothers– notably, for example, on the posters that sensationally appeared all overParis in 1623.54 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1072]It turns out that Boyle had spent some time in Paris in his youth, during aneducational tour of France and Geneva, and it is not impossible that he couldhave heard of the Rosicrucian Invisible College through his tutors or otheracquaintances. Frances Yates observes that there is, on face value, an uncannysimilarity in the terminology used by Boyle in his letters to his tutor and theterminology used by Francis Bacon in New Atlantis. Both authors speak of alearned and elite brotherhood that is ‘invisible’ and whose goal is thebetterment of all mankind – which both hope to achieve through an enlargement ofknowledge and by doing benevolent deeds.55[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1073]Many researchers agree that Theodore Haak and John Wilkins were probably thefounders of Boyle's Invisible College.56[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1074] Theodore Haak was a Germanimmigrant who had settled in England in the 1620s, and John Wilkins was a vicarwho later became bishop of Chester. At first there seems to be nothing in commonbetween the two men, until it is realised that Haak was a refugee from thePalatinate and that John Wilkins acted as chaplain for Prince Charles Louis, theeldest son of Frederick V of the Palatinate and Elizabeth Stuart. Others whomight have been connected to Boyle's Invisible College were the architectChristopher Wren and the alchemist Elias Ashmole. The Invisible College firstmet in London in 1645 then moved to Oxford in 1648. Let's look more closely atits activities and its members and at what it was trying to achieve.UTOPIA ON HOLD FOR THE CIVIL WARWhile in England, Theodore Haak acted as an unofficial diplomat for thePalatinate and, more especially, as the representative and agent to the Bohemianbishop, Jan Amos Komenský, better known as ‘Comenius’ (1592 – 1670).57[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1075] Comenius had been the bishop ofthe Bohemian Church of the Unity of Brethren until its fall in 1620 after theBattle of White Mountain near Prague. He was exiled with his fellow Protestantsin 1628 and settled in Poland, where he became rector of the gymnasium atLeszno. There he developed a new Christian philosophy, a pansophia or ‘universalknowledge’ expressed in one common language to facilitate communication andunderstanding among scholars throughout the world. Comenius's ideas werepublished in 1631 in a work entitled Janua Linguarum Reserata, which attractedthe interest of the great German philanthropist and educationalist SamuelHartlib who had been living in England since the mid-1620s.‘Hartlib, in his whole life and work’, wrote Frances Yates, ‘was something likewhat an R. C. Brother, if real and not invisible, might have been.’58[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1076] Dubbed the ‘Great Intelligencerof Europe’, Hartlib had set himself up as a human clearing-house, establishing asociety known as the ‘Office of Address’ in order to promote a ‘commonwealth oflearning’. The office encouraged and facilitated the intellectuals of Europe tocorrespond and to exchange ideas, and bears comparison with Francis Bacon's‘House of Salomon’. Both concepts centre on an elite international brotherhoodwhose objective is to reform society and serve all mankind.In 1640, two years before the Civil War broke out in England, the LongParliament proposed radical reforms that, if implemented, would have bloodlesslystripped the Stuart monarchy of much of its power. Amidst a mood of great publicexcitement and enthusiasm there were those who began to believe that the utopiansociety they had so much dreamed of might perhaps be achieved in England.Zealous speeches were given in Parliament, amongst them one by special inviteeSamuel Hartlib who presented his own vision of an ‘English utopia’. He hopedthat Parliament would adopt it and ‘lay the cornerstone of the world'shappiness’.According to Frances Yates, the experience of addressing such a lofty crowd insuch a lofty place went to Hartlib's head:In this thrilling hour when it seemed that England might be the land chosen … tobe the scene of the restoration of all things, when the possibility dawned thathere imaginary commonwealths might become real commonwealths, invisible collegesreal colleges, Hartlib wrote to Comenius and urged him to come to England toassist in the great work … Comenius in far away Poland was overjoyed. Hebelieved that he had a mandate from Parliament to build Bacon's New Atlantis inEngland.59 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1077]Comenius arrived in England in 1641, and was received by Haak and Hartlib. Amongthem was another of Hartlib's friends, the Scottish minister John Drury whomHartlib had known since the 1620s. It was, in fact, Drury who had beeninstrumental in bringing Comenius to London. A staunch Protestant and outspokenreformer, Drury had just published a book in which he urged the restoration tothe Palatinate of Prince Charles Louis, eldest son of the exiled Frederick V andElizabeth Stuart. It will be recalled that Charles Louis's personal chaplain wasJohn Wilkins, and we may well wonder, in view of such connections, whetherHartlib and Comenius might not have taken part in the activities of Haak andWilkin's Invisible College. At any rate, while in England, Comenius wrote a bookentitled Via Lucis, the ‘Way of Light’,60[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1078] in which he calls for theformation of an elite fraternity of learned men. These brothers, moreover, areto be guided by some ‘order’ or ‘sacred society’ devoted to the welfare ofhumankind and they are to spread the light through the use of a universallanguage.As well as the recurrent theme of ‘Light’ that seems to go right back toManichean Gnosticism, the reader will note the similarity to Bacon's ‘House ofSalomon’ with its learned fraternity that travelled the world and spoke manylanguages.61 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1079] The Rosicrucianslikewise claimed to be fluent in many languages and, in addition, to possesstheir own magical language and writing.But all the great utopian ideas and expectations generated by Hartlib, Comeniusand Drury came to nothing. A year after Comenius's arrival in England it waspretty obvious to everyone that the differences between Charles I and Parliamentwere irreconcilable and that civil war was inevitable. To Comenius especially,it became clear that the reformation he had hoped to bring about in England wasdefinitely not going to happen. In 1642, Comenius prepared to leave England forSweden, and John Drury took his leave for Holland.It was in this manner that the dreams the utopian reformers had for Britain wentup in smoke on 19 August 1642 when the king's banners were raised by theRoyalist army at Nottingham, effectively marking the beginning of the EnglishCivil War …THE DASHING CAVALIER OF THE PALATINATEAt the start of the war, success for the Royalists – or Cavaliers as they werebeing called – seemed assured. Notable among the Cavaliers was the very dashing23-year-old Prince Rupert, the younger son of the exiled Frederick V of thePalatinate and Elizabeth Stuart, the deposed king and queen of Bohemia. Rupertwas to become the hero of the English Civil War, highly admired for his gallantcavalry charges against the parliamentarian forces, nicknamed the Roundheads.Rupert's heroic example did much to boost the morale of the king's forces,especially after he reclaimed Bristol in July 1643, relieved Newark andNottingham in early 1644 and seized most of Lancashire by the summer of thatyear.But his luck was soon to run out. The parliamentarian Oliver Cromwell, a‘brawny, flushed-faced MP from Cambridge’, had trained an army of fanatics fromthe eastern counties and, with Sir Thomas Fairfax to command them by his side,Cromwell delivered the first serious blow to Prince Rupert's army at MarstonMoor in Yorkshire on 2 July 1644.62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1080] It was the beginning of the endfor the Royalists. But despite this terrible defeat, Rupert was appointedcommander-in-chief of the king's army, and managed to pocket one more victory byrecapturing the city of Leicester in May 1645. The following month he wasseverely beaten again by Cromwell at Naseby in Northamptonshire. When Rupertsurrendered at Bristol to the Roundheads, an angry Charles I stripped him of hiscommand. An odd career was to follow for Rupert. After the defeat of theRoyalists at Torrington in 1646, he was banished by the Puritan Parliament.Somehow he managed to take charge of a small Royalist fleet stationed in Hollandand became a dashing pirate of the seven seas, first preying on parliamentarianships and eventually taking his swashbuckling to the Azores and the WestIndies.63 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1081] Only after theRestoration did Rupert return to England.The end for the Royalists came in July 1646 when the king's stronghold at Oxfordwas surrounded and placed under siege by Cromwell and his Roundheads. Amongthose taken prisoner when the Royalists surrendered was a young man of 29 calledElias Ashmole, who had been serving as controller of the Ordnance Board for theking. Astrologer, alchemist and antiquarian extraordinaire, Elias Ashmole wasdestined to take a place of honour in the official history of Freemasonry …‘I WAS MADE A FREEMASON’Some four months after his capture by the Roundheads, Elias Ashmole made thefollowing entry in his diary:1646. Oct: 16. 4H 30’ P.M., I was made a Freemason at Warrington, in Lancashire…64 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1082]Most historians take this as the very first recorded Masonic initiation onEnglish soil, but others reasonably argue that the honour should go to SirRobert Moray. He was initiated into Freemasonry in 1641 at Newcastle-on-Tyne bymembers of the Edinburgh No. 1 Lodge who belonged to a Scottish regiment thathad crossed into England. Thus the names of Moray and Ashmole are interlocked inMasonic history forever. And not only in Freemasonry. As we shall see, what alsobrings these two names together is the crucial role that both men were to play afew decades later in the conversion of the ‘Invisible College’ at Oxford intothe very visible ‘Royal Society’ in London.On 30 January 1649, amid an eerie silence followed by the roll of drums, CharlesI was beheaded outside Whitehall Palace in London. England was renamed a‘Commonwealth and Free State’, and, a few years later, Oliver Cromwell becameLord Protector of this new and morose Puritan dominion. It was the nearest thatBritain was ever to get to a full-scale ‘revolution’. But there was none of thewild jubilation that would be seen much later in France in 1789 to greet thisodd and discomfited English ‘Republic’.In those turbulent and despotic years of Cromwell's rule, the Invisible Collegeorganised by Wilkins was moved to Cambridge and remained in low-key,semi-secrecy oblivious of the glorious future awaiting it. As for Wilkinshimself, he had been appointed warden of Wadham College at Oxford and later wasto become warden of Trinity College at Cambridge – the first and only scholarever to head both these illustrious institutions. In 1656, by one of those oddtwist of fate, Wilkins fell in love with and eventually married a widow, Mrs.Robina French, who was none other that the sister of Oliver Cromwell.Even though many had bitterly opposed Charles I’s tyrannical rule, the vastmajority of the British population remained Royalists at heart and there was adeep nationwide yearning for a return to monarchy. In the autumn of 1658, lessthan ten years after the shocking regicide at Whitehall, Oliver Cromwell died inbed a much hated and despised man, and hopes were again raised for a fullrestoration of the monarchy. All eyes turned towards the English Channel, acrosswhich the legitimate heir to the British throne was somewhere roaming.RESTORATION AND THE RETURN TO THE PROMISED LANDWhen Oxford fell in 1646 Charles I had ordered his eldest son, Charles thePrince of Wales, to leave the country and take refuge in France. After a briefstay in the Scilly Islands Prince Charles headed for Paris, where he rejoinedhis mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, the sister of King Louis XIII of France.Louis XIII had died three years earlier, leaving the throne to his son, Louis,the future Sun King whose glorious reign, the reader will recall, had beenpredicted by the Hermetic magus-astrologer, Tommaso Campanella. The future SunKing was only eight years old when Charles arrived in Paris, and apparently didnot much take to his older English cousin. Louis's mother, Queen Anne, and hertrusted prime minister, the imposing Italian Cardinal Jules Mazarin, practicallyran France, and it was widely believed that they were conducting an illicitromance, some even going as far as to suspect a secret marriage.65[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1083]The exile in Paris was to be a great disappointment and source of deepfrustration for Charles, for not only was he completely dominated by his Frenchmother, but also the French nobility snubbed him and ignored him. For severalyears he lingered in this state of limbo until the public execution of hisfather in London in 1649 jolted him back into action. Suddenly, at the Frenchcourt, Charles was proclaimed Charles II, king-in-exile. Gradually he was luredto join and lead the Scottish Presbyterian forces in Perth who opposedCromwell's regime. But this move proved to be disastrous, for the ill-organisedScots were no match for Cromwell's Roundheads and his parliamentarian cavalry,the Ironsides. When the two armies met at Dunbar on 3 September 1650 theScottish forces under Charles II were decisively smashed. A final defeat atWorcester in 1651 was too much for Charles II, and he fled again to France. Hislife degenerated into a string of tempestuous love affairs,66[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1084] and the small andpoverty-stricken English court-in-exile became the laughing stock of Paris.To make things worse, Mazarin came to terms with Cromwell and Charles II wasbooted out of France, left to wander around Europe and eventually southernGermany, where he sank further into a life of debauchery and idleness, siring atleast three illegitimate children in the process.67[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1085] Most of his time was spenthatching harebrained plots against Cromwell – on one occasion he even consideredoffering to marry the Lord Protector's daughter and to share the realm withhim.68 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1086] Finally, in the autumn of1658 news was brought to Charles of Cromwell's death, and suddenly a new windowof opportunity opened for him. He made haste for the port of Calais on theFrench coast and there waited to seize the moment.At first it seemed as if the Protectorate and Puritan Republic left behind byCromwell would prove too deep-rooted for the badly organised Royalists to wrenchit back into their possession. But soon things began to fall apart for thePuritans, for Cromwell's son and successor, Richard, lacked the experience andcharacter of his father. He was thus unable to contain the growing rift betweenthe Roundhead army and Parliament, a conflict that quickly created a mood ofuncertainty and discontent throughout the kingdom. The London taverns buzzedwith talk of a possible ‘restoration’ of the Stuart monarchy and by early 1660the whole country was fired up by Royalist supporters among the common folk.An ex-Royalist soldier, George Monk, who was in control of Scotland for thePuritans, was now eager to avoid more anarchy and bloodshed, and decided tosupport the idea of a restoration. Monk arranged for an emissary, Sir JohnGrenville, to sail across the Channel in secret and meet with Charles II and hissmall court. A deal was struck that gave Charles full support from Monk and hispowerful armed forces if he, Charles, would consent to certain conditions –mainly to uphold the Church of England but also to grant ‘liberty to tenderconsciences’ who practiced other faiths, and to leave important matters of stateto Parliament. Charles II agreed, and Monk moved his huge army towards London.In April 1660 Charles issued his famous Declaration of Breda from Holland, wherehe promised a general amnesty to his enemies, ‘liberty of conscience’, equitablesettlement to land disputes, full payment in arrears to the army and, mostimportant of all, a free Parliament to run the affairs of the state. And on abreezy day in late May 1660, Charles II boarded the flagship Naseby,appropriately renamed the Royal Charles, and set sail for England.The Royal Charles docked at Dover on 25 May. Monk was there on the quayside toreceive Charles II in great pomp and in the midst of wild jubilation andemotional scenes. Huge spontaneous celebrations greeted the king all along theway to London, and the royal procession made a triumphal entry into the city on29 May, the day of Charles II’s 30th birthday. John Evelyn, the famous diaristand horticulturist, who was an eyewitness to the event, vividly described thescene:20,000 horse and foot, brandishing their swords, and shouting with inexpressiblejoy; the way strewn with flowers, the bells ringing, the streets hung withtapestry, fountains running with wine … myriads of people flocking even so faras from Rochester … it was the Lord's doing, for such a restoration was nevermentioned in any history, ancient or modern, since the return of the Jews fromthe Babylonian captivity …69 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1087]Also the poet Andrew Marvell drew inspiration from the Bible, and describedCharles II as being ‘of a tall stature and sable hue, much like the son of Kish,that lofty Jew’.70 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1088]Such well-chosen analogies presenting Charles II as the ‘son of Kish, that loftyJew’ and his restoration as a sort of ‘return of the Jews from the Babyloniancaptivity’ are most revealing, for they signal the incredible mood that hadenveloped the return of this prodigal royal son to his ‘Promised Land’ –England. Such analogies also have a distinct ‘Masonic’ ring to them, for as wehave seen, the name ‘son of Kish’ (or ‘son of Cush’, i.e. the biblical Nimrod)appears in the Old Charges, where he is said to be none other than ‘Hermes theFather of Wise Men’ who finds the two pillars upon which all the sciences werewritten. Nimrod, who was dark in complexion71[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1089] like Charles II,72[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1090] immediately evokes the Tower ofBabel, which is another important ‘Masonic’ symbol73[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1091] – one that was very significantto Comenius, Hartlib and Bacon in their search for a universal language. As forthe ‘return of the Jews from Babylonian captivity’, this is one of the principlethemes of Freemasonry, for it marked the events that lead to the rebuilding ofSolomon's Temple in Jerusalem.74 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1092]And so here we have it, couched in symbolic language, the hope that London wouldsoon become the epicentre of a far greater ‘restoration’ involving the‘sciences’ and ‘ancient wisdom’ in a wonderful ‘New Jerusalem’ rising like aphoenix from the smouldering ashes of the Civil War. Little did anyone suspectthat soon this euphoric vision would literally become true – not as they hadintended but as a nightmarish satanic vision from the very gates of hell …FROM INVISIBLE COLLEGE TO ROYAL SOCIETYIt says something for the character of Charles II that he spent the evening ofhis triumphal entry into London triumphantly entering into Barbara Palmer, thebeautiful young wife of the Royalist Roger Palmer who he had recently met at theHague in Holland.75 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1093] She was theking's latest conquest, but many more were to follow. It was the start of an eraof decadence at court that would soon disappoint those who had hoped for greatthings from the Restoration. Within four years England was again engaged in adisastrous and costly war, this time with Holland. And as if such a man-madecalamity was not enough, London itself would receive two terrible blows insuccession that would hit the city with such force that many came to believethey were witnessing divine retribution for the debauchery of Charles II.Meanwhile in these early days of the Restoration, with great changes andreformations still expected from the new king, the Invisible College decided tomake its move.In late November 1660 twelve members of this self-styled Invisible College metin a room at Gresham College in London. This was right after they had attended alecture by Christopher Wren, the Gresham professor of astronomy, who was one oftheir number. There and then it was decided to found a ‘College for thePromotion of Physico-Mathematicall Experimentall Learning’ which, very soon,would become the Royal Society. Among the twelve men that met at Gresham Collegewere Robert Boyle, John Wilkins and Robert Moray. Christopher Wren was 28 at thetime. John Wilkins, who had been in at the origins of the Invisible College withTheodore Haak, was appointed as chairman to this meeting. Robert Moray, thefirst Freemason to be initiated on English soil in 1641, advised the group thatthey should obtain a royal charter, and in early December Charles II gave hisapproval for the creation of the Royal Society. The society moved into premisesat Gresham College, and it was decided immediately to draw up a list of suitablemembers.A list of 40 was prepared, which included Elias Ashmole, Freemason parexcellence and Rosicrucian enthusiast. Another on the list was the diarist andhorticulturalist John Evelyn (1620 – 1706) who, as we will recall, had likenedthe return of Charles II and his court to the ‘return of the Jews’ to thePromised Land. According to Masonic historian and author Robert Lomas, JohnEvelyn was almost certainly a Freemason.76[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1094]Things were about to move very fast for many of these early members. EliasAshmole was appointed by Charles II as Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary aswell as Controller and Auditor of the Excise; Christopher Wren was made SavilianProfessor of Astronomy at Oxford, although a far greater honour awaited him whenlater he shifted his career into the field of architecture. And the diarist JohnEvelyn was appointed to serve on several royal commissions. Robert Moray,possibly the most influential player in the formation of the Royal Society,acted as its first ad hoc president until the royal charter was granted byCharles II in 1662, after which Moray moved into permanent residence at theking's court at Whitehall.PARALLEL DEVELOPMENTS IN FRANCEAlthough much praise and honour is bestowed on the Royal Society for being thefirst scientific academic body of its kind, it is often forgotten that another‘royal’ society with even more illustrious royal patronage was already active inthe city of Paris. In fact since the early 1640s, a group of scientistsincluding the great mathematicians Blaise Pascal, Pierre Gassendi, RenéDescartes and Gilles de Roberval, had met informally in Paris, first at theresidence of the famous theologian and mathematician Marin Mersenne and, after1648, at the home of their sponsor Henri Louis Habert de Montmor.77[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1095] This small but very powerfulelite group was eventually to serve as the nucleus of the Académie des Sciencesfounded in 1666 under the patronage of Louis XIV.Indeed, even earlier than the creation of this scientific body, the powerfulCardinal Richelieu, as ‘prime minister’ of France, had founded the AcadémieFrançaise in 1638 under his own patronage and backed by letters of patent fromLouis XIII. At the death of Richelieu in 1642 the patronage passed to thechancellor Pierre Séguier, the Count of Gien, and, after him, to Louis XIV – whohimself became royal patron. Exactly like the Invisible College, the AcadémieFrançaise sprung to life amongst a group of learned men who met informally.There were originally twelve members, then after the society was granted royalcharter, the membership was expanded to 40. The reader will recall that theRoyal Society in England was also to develop in the same way, with twelveinformal founder members building up to 40 official members after December 1660.The original objective of the Académie Française was to develop the Frenchlanguage into a format that would allow it to be understood by all, that is tobecome universalised into a lingua franca. This, of course, brings to mind theoriginal ambitions of the Invisible College, with the universal-language schemesconcocted by Hartib, Comenius and Wilkins. It also recalls the claim made by theRosicrucian brotherhood, namely that its members could communicate with all thepeoples of the world through a sort of ‘natural language’, appropriately dubbedthe ‘silent language’ by modern Rosicrucian researchers.78[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1096]Had this natural, magical language anything to do with the Masonic secret signlanguage that also employs ancient symbols, particularly those used byRenaissance Hermetic-Cabalists and also Rosicrucian adepts? Whatever the answerto such a provocative question, it is nonetheless justified to a certain extentfor us to wonder whether the developments of a philosophical-scientific group inParis in the 1630s might not have had something to do with the Rosicrucianmovement and, more particularly, the ‘poster scare’ of 1623 when it was allegedthat emissaries of the Invisible College of the Rosicrucians had arrived inFrance, or were about to arrive, who could communicate in a universal or‘natural’ language as a tool to reform and better the condition of the world.79[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1097]THE SCOTTISH CONNECTIONAs regards the formation of the Royal Society in England in 1660, all historiansagree that the initial driving force of this institution was Robert Moray. We'vealready seen how, in 1641, Moray was the first Freemason to be initiated onBritish soil. This event occurred two years after Cardinal Richelieu founded theAcadémie Française in 1638. In that same fateful year of 1638 the future SunKing Louis XIV was born and the Hermetic philosopher Tommaso Campanella, who hadprophesied the unexpected birth, dedicated his famous City of the Sun toRichelieu.80 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1098] The connection isthat Robert Moray had spent many years in Paris where he had joined the ScotsGuard of Louis XIII in 1633. In 1638 he had been elevated to the command of theguard by Richelieu who greatly admired this rather bold and refined youngScotsman.81 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1099]Twelve years later, in 1652, Moray married the lady Sophia Lindsay,82[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1100] daughter of Sir David Lindsay,the first Earl of Balcarres. Lindsay was a learned man who enjoyed the privatelife. He had a keen interest in alchemy, and in his library were to be foundmany alchemical works which Lindsay himself had translated and copied inScottish colloquial in his own handwriting, including some ‘Rosicrucianliterature’.83 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1101] It was also in1652 that Moray sponsored the very first English-language edition of theRosicrucian Manifestos which was published by the famous Welsh alchemist ThomasVaughan (brother of the poet Henry Vaughan), who wrote under the pseudonym‘Eugenius Philalethes’.84 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1102] AnthonyWood, a contemporary, was to describe Thomas Vaughan as ‘a zealous brother ofthe Rosie-Crucian fraternity’, and then also Moray, his sponsor, as a ‘mostrenowned chymist [and] great patron of the Rosie-Crucians.’85[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1103] With such keen sustained interestin all things Rosicrucian, one wonders if a contact did not take place betweenMoray and Campanella, both of whom were at the French court in 1638, both ofwhom were sponsored by Richelieu and, more importantly, both of whom had actedas patrons to the Rosicrucian movement.There is yet another Royal Society founder to consider, the diarist John Evelyn,who also was no stranger to Paris in those troubled times. In 1643, after theoutbreak of the Civil War in England, Evelyn left for Paris, then travelled toRome, Venice and Padua. He was back in Paris in 1646, where a year later hemarried Mary Browne, the daughter of the British ambassador. Evelyn stayed inParis till 1652. Was he, too, exposed to the ‘Rosicrucian’ and Hermetic ideasthat hovered at the French court? It would be odd, indeed, if he was not.According to Masonic historian Robert Lomas, the Jacobean court-in-exile inParis was rife with Freemasons. Many of the Scots Guards, for example, wereMasons from Scottish lodges including, of course, their leader, Robert Moray.The Masonic historian and Master of the famous Lodge of Antiquity, WilliamPreston, who is known among Freemasons for having published the very popularbook Illustrations of Freemasonry in 1772, even believed that Charles II himselfmight have been a member of the brotherhood.86[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1104] Early Freemasons with a greatappetite for illumination and arcane knowledge would have been particularlyreceptive to such ‘Rosicrucian’ ideas and the Hermetic-Christian utopian visionthat Campanella preached. It is not impossible that these influences in Parismight have prompted Moray to seek out the Invisible College when he returned toEngland.But we are now going to examine the connection of yet another Royal Societyfounder who deserves even closer scrutiny. For this particular English gentlemanwas to play a pivotal role in the events that were soon, quite literally, toreshape the old city of London …BLAZING STAR OF DOOMTowards the end of 1664 rumours spread that a ‘blazing star’ had been seen inthe southeast sky from London. It was a comet. And these rare and impressivecosmic visitors were believed in those days to be the harbingers of ‘famine andplague’ and other such calamities.87[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1105] Martin Luther, the GermanProtestant leader, even believed comets to be the signs of God's wrath or tokensof the Second Coming.88 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1106] On 15December 1664, Robert Hooke, a senior member of the Royal Society, reported the‘blazing star’ to his colleagues. On 17 December Robert Moray spotted it fromhis observatory at Whitehall, and soon others saw it from other locations.It vanished from view about the end of January 1665 but then just two monthslater in March 1665 a second comet appeared.89[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1107] Amongst the general public andthe erudite alike this was taken as the ultimate herald of doom. And they werenot to be disappointed. In May 1665 the bubonic plague hit the city of London.The nightmarish disease was first noticed in the parish of St. Gilles in theFields. With its narrow, dirt infested alleys, its virtually nonexistentdrainage, and its total lack of public hygiene, London in the mid-1660s was theperfect environment for the Great Plague to strike and take hold. To makematters worse, the month of June that year was unusually hot, giving moreimpetus to the deadly epidemic. Within a few months people began to die indroves.Predictably many attributed the Great Plague to the wrath of God. HenryOldenburg, secretary of the Royal Society, went as far as to claim that ‘when wehave purged our foul sins this horrible evil will cease.’90[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1108] Alarmed by the rising number ofdeaths, Charles II moved his court to Oxford in July, leaving the Londoners totheir grim fate.91 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1109] All those whocould afford it followed suit, moving either into the country or, better still,across the Channel to the safety of continental Europe. It was at this time thatChristopher Wren took the opportunity to travel to France …CHRISTOPHER WREN'S ESOTERIC PEDIGREEChristopher Wren was educated at Westminster School and completed his studies atWadham College, Oxford, where he attained the prestigious Fellowship of AllSouls in 1653. Within a few years he was appointed professor of astronomy atGresham College in London and, after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, hewas given the prestigious chair of Savilian Professor of Astronomy at theUniversity of Oxford. He was only 29 when he took up this post, but even thenwas regarded by his peers as one of the most learned men in England.Wren developed a close friendship with Prince Rupert of the Palatinate, who alsoheld the title of Duke of Cumberland. Prince Rupert, like John Evelyn and RobertMoray, spent some time in Paris with Charles II during his exile. And likeMoray, he had been very well received by Richelieu. On his return to Englandafter the Restoration Rupert developed a keen interest in ‘natural science’ andbecame an active member of the Royal Society, often travelling to Oxford tovisit Wren and see him at work in his laboratory.It will be remembered that John Wilkins, one of the original founders of theInvisible College, was chaplain to Rupert's older brother, Prince Charles Louis,the elector palatine-in-exile. Wren, in fact, had probably known Prince CharlesLouis in his childhood, when both were at the deanery at Windsor where Wren'sfather had been stationed as registrar of the Order of the Garter. In thoseearly days Wren himself had been a protégée of Wilkins.92[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1110] When we recall how much FrederickV of the Palatinate, the ill-fated father of Rupert and Charles Louis, had beenindirectly entangled in the Rosicrucian movement in Germany, and also the manyRosicrucian connections that can be traced to the founding members of theInvisible College, it is tempting to consider the possibility that Wren toomight have been influenced by the same Rosicrucian ideologies.In 1663 Wren began to develop a keen interest in architecture, and it wasbecoming clear to him that this career, rather than one in mathematics orastronomy, was his true and natural vocation. Although Wren was a brilliantgeometrician and had a talent for model-making and design, one cannot help butwonder if it was not his contact with the Invisible College in 1660, and moreparticularly the Masonic attachments of individual members of the InvisibleCollege, that might have inspired him to make such a switch at this ratheradvanced stage of his academic career. We have seen how Freemasons holdarchitecture and geometry in the highest esteem. After all, the legendary heroof Freemasonry, Hiram Abiff, was allegedly the architect of Solomon's Temple.Likewise Freemasons also refer to God, who they prefer to call the SupremeBeing, as the ‘Grand Architect of the Universe’.Since many, if not all, the protagonists who played a part in the formation ofthe Royal Society were Freemasons we ought not be too be surprised to find thatWren was a member of the brotherhood as well. According to Anderson'sConstitutions of Freemasons (second edition) published in 1738, Christopher Wrenwas already a Master Freemason in 1673 and later, in 1685, became the GrandMaster of all English Freemasons.93[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1111] Other documents suggest that Wrenmay have joined the Freemasons by 1663, perhaps even earlier.94[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1112] It is also thought that Wren wasa regular member of one of the four original Masonic lodges that wereamalgamated in 1717 to form the Grand Lodge of England.95[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1113] This lodge was originally locatedat St. Paul's in London, and it is almost certain that Wren was at one time itsMaster.96 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1114]PAUSING TO DEPOSIT WREN IN PARIS WE MAKE AN EXCURSION TO ROME TO STUDY AMYSTERIOUS OBELISKWhen Christopher Wren arrived in Paris in late July 1665, he was in for a greattreat.Louis XIV was in the process of launching a massive revival in classical andbaroque architecture in Paris and Versailles. He had invited the great Italianbaroque architect, Gian Lorenzo Bernini to be advisor and witness to theseevents and, specifically, to design the new façade for the Louvre Palace. At thetime Bernini, whose reputation in architecture had reached almost heroic levels,had just begun the design of the great plaza in front of the Vatican Basilica ofSt. Peter in Rome, at the centre of which still stands today an intact ancientEgyptian obelisk surmounted by a golden cross.97[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1115]We shall digress briefly to tell a little of the story of this ‘Vatican Obelisk’and of Bernini's role in its final decoration, since these matters have abearing on our primary theme – namely the survival of secret traditions thathave carried ancient Egyptian religious concepts and symbolism through time andlodged them in the Western heartlands of orthodox Christian power.The Vatican Obelisk, which stands more than 25 meters tall and weighs 320 tons,is hewn from a single block of solid granite. One of 13 original Egyptianobelisks that can still be seen in Rome today,98[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1116] it is somewhat unusual in thatnone of its faces bear inscriptions telling us anything about its origins. Weknow for certain, however, that it was brought to Rome from Egypt on the ordersof Emperor Caligula (AD 12 – 41). It was transported across the Mediterranean ina special ship and set in place in AD 37 in the ‘Vatican Circus’, which Caligulahad built for chariot racing.As to the ancient Egyptian provenance of the obelisk, we learn from the Romanhistorian Pliny, a contemporary of Caligula, that it had been made originallyfor one ‘Nuncoreus, the son of Sesostris’.99[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1117] The reference here is to the 12thdynasty Pharaoh Sesostris I (1971 – 1926 BC) who carried out extensiverestoration at ancient Egypt's most sacred city, Anu, which the Greeks wouldlater call Heliopolis – literally the ‘City of the Sun’. Heliopolis was itself asort of ‘Vatican City’ in the sense that it held the same powerful symbolicsignificance to the ancient Egyptians as the Vatican does to devout RomanCatholics today. But on the actual site of ancient Heliopolis, in the suburbs ofmodern Cairo, almost nothing is left to show of former glories. The magnificentSun Temple that once formed the sacred heart of ancient Egyptian spirituality isnowhere to be seen and the only remnant of any size is a lone obelisk raised bySesostris I.100 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1118] On this and otherevidence scholars have concluded that the Vatican Obelisk also originally stoodat Heliopolis and may perhaps even have formed one of a pair with the obeliskthat remains on site.Historian Christopher Hibbert, in his book Rome: the Biography of a City,asserts simply that ‘the obelisk of Saint Peter's Square was transported byCaligula from Heliopolis in 37 AD.’101[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1119] Likewise in their book RomaEgizia (‘Egyptian Rome’) Italian scholars Anna Maria Partini and Boris deRachewiltz accept Pliny's statement that the Vatican Obelisk was originally fromHeliopolis and belonged to a son of Sesostris. But they establish additionallythat it was not brought directly from Heliopolis to Rome but was first taken byEmperor Augustus Caesar to Alexandria and raised there in the Julian Forum,where it remained until it was shipped to Rome by Caligula in AD 37.102[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1120]As we've seen Caligula had the obelisk raised in the Vatican Circus as thecentrepiece of his private chariot-racing grounds. There it was to remain forthe next 1600 years while the Vatican Circus – where Saint Peter was believed tohave been martyred in AD 64 – was redeveloped to become the heart and centre ofthe Roman Catholic world. Begun in AD 334 by Constantine the Great (but notcompleted until the 16th century by the architects and sculptors Bramante,Raphael and finally Michelangelo himself)103[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1121] the Basilica of Saint Peter wasbuilt half over the top of, and overlapping with, the Vatican Circus.The result was that Caligula's obelisk ended up close to the south wall of theBasilica. It was observed in that spot in the 14th century by a certain MasterGregorius, an English prelate who made a journey to Rome and left us an account.He describes the obelisk as standing in a dark alley, its base and pedestalcompletely covered by rubbish, flanked by crumbling old houses up against thewall of the Basilica.In the 15th century the plan was first conceived to move the ancient Egyptianrelic to the position of honour it occupies today in the centre of Saint Peter'sSquare. The idea came from Pope Nicholas V (1447 – 1455) who intended that thebase of the obelisk should stand on four life-size bronze statues of theEvangelists and that its tip should be surmounted by a huge bronze Jesus with agolden cross in his hand. Nicholas died before he could commission the work andthe project lapsed.It fell to Pope Sixtus V (1585 – 1590) to complete the plan. Dubbed the ‘Last ofthe Renaissance Popes’, Sixtus was:… intent on making Rome Europe's finest city, and St. Peter's its grandestbasilica. He was responsible for redesigning the city's entire layout, chieflyby the construction of immense avenues which opened up a series of vistasanchored in obelisks radiating from the core of the built-up area immediatelyacross the Tiber from the Vatican towards the hills in the east.104[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1122]Sixtus dispensed with the four figures of the Evangelists proposed by Nicolas Vfor the base of the Vatican Obelisk and replaced them with four lions around astone pedestal. He also dispensed with the idea of a statue of Jesus balanced onthe tip of the obelisk. A bronze sphere, popularly believed to contain the ashesof Julius Caesar – the first ‘divine’ emperor of Rome and also ‘pharaoh’ ofEgypt – had been positioned there by Caligula but proved on examination to beempty. Deciding to retain the sphere, Sixtus placed inside it fragments ofChrist's supposed ‘True Cross’ that were in the possession of the Vatican. Hethen ordered that the heraldic symbol of his own family, a star over three smallmountains, be placed above the bronze sphere, and, above the star, a goldencross. It was in this form, therefore, surmounted by a cross, that the ancientobelisk from Heliopolis was finally raised in the heart of the Vatican on 27September 1588.105 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1123]The first thing Sixtus did after the obelisk was safely upright was to have itexorcised. With all the usual bells and incense a bishop stood before it andsolemnly cried out:I exorcise you, creature of stone, in the name of omnipotent God, that you maybecome an exorcised stone worthy of supporting the Holy Cross, and be freed fromany vestige of impurity or shred of paganism and from any assault of spiritualimpurity.106 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1124]To make sure that the point was properly driven home, Sixtus had the sameformula carved permanently into the western and eastern sides of the base of theobelisk.Ironically, however, the anti-pagan message was flatly contradicted by a secretor ‘invisible’ message that the obelisk itself had begun to pulse forth from themoment that a cross was fixed to its apex. The message was secret because it waswritten in three dimensions in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs which no one in the16th century is supposed to have been able to read. Whether by pure coincidence,or by design, however, it is a fact that an obelisk surmounted by a cross is asymbol that would have had a meaning for ancient Egyptian priests. The meaningis the name of the most sacred ‘pagan’ city of antiquity – Anu-Heliopolis – theancient Egyptian ‘City of the Sun’. Not only is the Sixtus arrangement of theobelisk meaningful in the ancient Egyptian language, in other words, but also,and much more impressive, the meaning is correct – since Anu-Heliopolis was thevery place where this obelisk originally came from!One small detail might spoil this otherwise intriguing picture. Although it istrue that a hieroglyph showing an obelisk surmounted by a cross would have beenunderstood as Anu (Heliopolis) by an ancient Egyptian priest, the symbol isnevertheless incomplete. It should normally be accompanied by a circle orellipse divided into eight parts – the standard hieroglyphic indicator of acity. The failure of Sixtus and his architects to include such a circle in theplan for Saint Peter's Square seems to rule out any notion that some secretHermetic game was being played here.Or it would if things had been left the way they were when Sixtus died in 1590.Instead, more than 70 years later, the architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini wascommissioned by Pope Alexander VII (1655 – 1667) to redesign Saint Peter'sSquare. He chose to surround it with elegant freestanding colonnades, creating ahuge elliptical space centred on the obelisk. Bernini's work on the project, aswe noted above, was interrupted in 1665 when he took up Louis XIV’s personalinvitation to visit Paris. But he completed it on his return to Rome by markingout on the plaza, around the base of the obelisk, the beautiful geometricalpattern of a gentle ellipse divided into eight parts that can be seen there tothis day.Coincidence? Or could some secret group, capable of sustaining influence on thepapacy over many decades, have understand ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs longbefore scholars learnt to read them in the 19th century?Anu-Heliopolis was the archetypal ‘City of the Sun’ that Giordano Bruno andTommaso Campanella had been determined to restore. And we have shown that Brunoand Campanella were not alone but were part of a larger network of Hermetic and‘Rosicrucian’ thinkers spread across Europe who had become very influential –though still not unburnable – by the mid-1660s. The defiant act of writing thename of Heliopolis in ‘invisible language’ in the midst of the Vatican'sproudest stronghold is precisely the sort of symbolic and talismanic guerrillawarfare that we would expect of the members of such a network.But there is no proof. The reader must decide.AN ENGLISH ARCHITECT MEETS HIS HERO AT THE COURT OF THE SUN KINGLet's now return to Paris in July of 1665 where Christopher Wren had justarrived, fleeing the Great Plague in London, and where Bernini was then also inresidence, invited by Louis XIV to design the new façade for the Louvre Palace.At the court of Louis XIV Bernini mingled with France's leading architects suchas Louis Le Vaux and Claude Perrault, as well as the great landscape architectAndré Le Nôtre. Born in 1613, Le Nôtre came from an illustrious family of royalgardeners – his grandfather had been in charge of the Tuileries Garden at theLouvre Palace, and his father had been the chief gardener of Louis XIII. At thebirth of the Sun King Louis XIV, Le Nôtre was put in charge of the Tuileries andLuxembourg Gardens. Later, at the peak of Louis XIV’s reign, Le Nôtre woulddesign and engineer the famous Gardens of Versailles.When Wren visited Paris, Le Nôtre was a mature man of 52 with an immensereputation at court. Since 1656 he had been in full control of all the king'sbuildings, and was on the verge of beginning one of his most ambitious – andleast publicised – projects: the so-called Grande Cours or ‘Great Course’. Thecentral idea was a wide processional avenue, starting from the Tuileries, thatwould open the outlook from the Louvre towards the west. It had originally beenproposed during the reign of Henri IV, the grandfather of the Sun King. Butnothing was done about it until 1661, when Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV’sall-powerful minister of finance, appointed Le Nôtre to bring the idea tofruition.Le Nôtre's scheme somehow manages to be grandiose yet exquisitely simple at thesame time. A contemporary plan now kept in the Archives des Hauts-de-Seine,shows a vast straight avenue (the celebrated Champs-Élysées), 107[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1125] flanked on either side by rows oftrees, running westward from the Tuileries all the way to the Pont de Neuilly.Roughly at the centre of the avenue there was a flat-topped hill, then known asthe Colline de Chaillot, on which Le Nôtre proposed to situate a huge piazza inthe shape of a ‘star’.108 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1126] In thefullness of time the latter was to become the Place de l’Étoile where, in 1815,Napoleon commissioned the famous Arc de Triomphe, today perhaps Paris's bestknown landmark.109 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1127]It was amidst illustrious men, therefore, in a Paris buzzing with newarchitectural concepts and idealistic city plans, that Christopher Wren was tospend six months of his life at the formative stage of his new architecturalcareer. And aside from the obvious lure of the architectural revival thenunderway, a flurry of scientific activities also attracted the Englishman. Hemet with the topographer Melchisédech Thévenot, the astronomer Pierre Petit – acollaborator of Blaise Pascal – as well as the Huguenot philosopher HenriJustel. Both Petit and Justel would themselves eventually become fellows of theRoyal Society.110 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1128] Wren alsobefriended the physicist Adrien Auzout, who, like him, had cultivated a deepinterest in architecture. Thévenot, Petit and Auzout belonged to the group ofscientists we mentioned earlier who met, very much like a Parisian version ofthe Invisible College, under the patronage of Habert de Montmor. There was muchtalk of formalising this group under the charter of Louis XIV – again in thesame fashion as the Royal Society – and members were thus naturally interestedto meet Christopher Wren and to hear his views on the matter.Wren also met Bernini, who had arrived in Paris just a month before he did. Butat the time of this meeting, it is important to recall, Wren was to Bernini as anew undergraduate is to the head of a school of architecture. In short, Wren atthis point was a nobody while Bernini was a giant who commanded the respect, thefunds and even the patience of the pope and many kings and princes of Europe. Inconsequence the great Bernini was constantly swamped by his admirers while hewas in Paris – so we may not suppose that he took much notice of theinsignificant Wren.For Wren himself, however, it was a life-changing encounter. To meet face toface, even briefly, with his architectural superhero, was an experience thataffected him deeply. It is probable that from this moment on he was fired by theambition that was to make him one of England's greatest architects. Here is howAdrian Tinniswood, Wren's latest biographer, sums up the meeting:With hindsight this meeting is one of the most momentous in the history ofseventeenth-century architecture – the man destined to be England's greatestexponent of the Baroque in a face-to-face encounter with the most famous Baroquearchitect in Europe111 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1129] … Thebenefits Wren gained from his visit to France were considerable. They range fromthe experience of a more sophisticated architectural milieu than he knew inEngland, and a chance to exchange ideas in a less sophisticated, but stillrewarding, scientific milieu, to the quantities of books he brought home withhim – ‘almost all France in paper’.112[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1130]But Christopher Wren may have brought back something else, something perhapsless tangible than drawings and papers but far more powerful: a ‘vision’ of thenew role he had to play in the restored Stuart monarchy. We shall return to thecity of Paris and its exciting scientific and amazing architectural renaissancein later chapters. Meanwhile things became uncomfortable there for Wren whenLouis XIV declared war on Britain in January 1666 in support of the Frenchalliance with the Dutch. It was time for Wren to go home. He arrived back inLondon in March 1666 and within a few months an incredible opportunity was todrop into his lap – one that no one could have imagined in their wildest dreams… or nightmares as the case would be.RISING FROM THE ASHESThe Great Fire of London began on 2 September 1666, apparently sparked in abakery at Pudding Lane, near London Bridge, when Thomas Farriner, the king'sbaker, forgot to dowse the fire of his oven before going to bed. Some embersfell on nearby kindling and soon his rickety wooden house was in flames. Inthose days the houses in the city of London were mostly built with timber framesand pitched roofs, which caused them to burn like big matchboxes. Within a fewhours several streets were engulfed in a swirling inferno, with the fieryprogress aided by a violent easterly wind that fanned the flames. By the timethe Great Fire had abated five days later, 430 acres, that is nearly four fifthsof the city, had been reduced to cinders. About 13,000 houses, 90 churches and50 liveries had been destroyed, and even the great Cathedral of St. Paul's hadbeen ruined.Apparently Charles II himself worked heroically alongside the firefighters,which earned him back some public respect. Nonetheless, the king's enemies werequick to claim that this was God's wrath for the debaucheries at court and theungodly foreign policies of Parliament. A pamphlet issued by the Dutch, who wereat war with England, called it a vengeful act from the ‘Almighty and Just God’,and the Catholics in Britain promptly agreed with them. Even the London Gazettewas to report that ‘the heavy hand of God is upon us for our sins, shewing ushis Judgement in raising the fire.’113[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1131] One also wonders what the Jews ofLondon must have thought with Rosh Hashanah (Day of Judgement) only ten daysaway, and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) a further ten.114[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1132]The rumour mill cycled wildly. Stories of a ‘papal plot’, or a ‘foreign plot’,or ‘God's Wrath’ were rife. Charles II did his best to persuade the angrypopulation of London, now gathered at Moorfields, that their collectivemisfortune was due to nothing more than an accident. He vowed gallantly to takegood care of all homeless Londoners and to rebuild their homes and their cityimmediately. But it is probable that the king was not entirely displeased atthis opportunity, for he himself was a bit of dabbler in town-planning anddesign. Since the Restoration he had been bitterly frustrated by the lack offunds to transform London into a splendid metropolis that would eclipse the‘City of Light’ that his cousin, Louis XIV, was turning Paris into. Now here,out of the blue, had come this amazing opportunity that might allow him to dojust that.115 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1133]A new London, everyone hoped after hearing the king's emotional speech atMoorfields, was about to rise like a great phoenix from the smouldering ashes.Or, better still, like a ‘New Jerusalem’, as we will see in the next chapter."},{"pageContent":"The major theme of the Knights Templar legend is its survival through the formof secret societies … The Templars themselves were a secret society … It hassurvived into Freemasonry … Freemasonry, then, is the heir of the Templars [and]purports to be the recipient of the ancient wisdom of the builders of Solomon'sTemple coming down to them from the Crusades.Alain Demurger, Vie et mort de l'ordre du Temple Even a brief survey will show that he [Charles II] was dedicated to privatealchemical experiments … Such a king could indeed be expected to provide thelong awaited ‘Solomon's House’…Donald R.

The second is more complex,with multiple branches and terminals, and is known as the Sephirothic Tree orthe ‘Tree of Life’. It is derived from Hebrew Cabala, a system of Jewishmysticism that was elaborated in Occitania during the great period ofintellectual and religious freedom that was ushered in there by the rise ofCatharism in the 12th century.The octagon and the Sephirothic Tree remain hidden in plain view in Washingtonto this day, as we will show in Chapter Nineteen, and can easily be seen by theprepared eye in Wren's and Evelyn's abandoned plans for London, which we willexamine later in this chapter. In both cases the real issue is not so muchdemonstrating the use of the symbols but trying to find out why they were usedin the first place. What was it that Wren and Evelyn, as well as theirsuccessors in the American Revolution, had in mind with these devices? Why wouldthe octagon and the Sephirothic Tree have been significant to them?The first clue that will help us to answer these questions does not lie inLondon in the 17th century or Washington in the 18th century, but in Occitaniain the 13th century in an anomaly of the history of the Albigensian Crusades.MYSTERY OF THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARWe saw in Part I how the Albigensian Crusades that smashed the Cathars in the13th century were mounted at the instigation of successive popes and fought byarmies recruited from all over Europe, though principally from northern France.During the whole period of sustained warfare in Occitania, however, from thefall of Béziers in 1209 until the fall of Montségur in 1244, there were largenumbers of seemingly obvious ‘crusaders’ permanently on hand in Provence and theLanguedoc who took almost no part in the fighting at all. This is odd and whatmakes it odder is that these reluctant crusaders against the Cathar heresy wereall members of an elite order of highly-trained warrior monks, sworn to papalservice, who had already proved themselves in the Holy Land as valiant crusadersagainst the forces of Islam. Their full title was the ‘Poor Knights of Christand the Temple of Solomon’, but they're much better known as the KnightsTemplar.We do not propose to rehearse at great length here the familiar story of theTemplars that has been told so many times before. But some background isunavoidable if we are going to work out why they abstained from the Cathar warswhen we would have expected them to join in wholeheartedly on behalf of theChurch.The order was founded by nine French noblemen who travelled to the Holy Land in1119 – twenty years after Jerusalem had been captured and occupied by theChristian powers in the First Crusade of 1099. The 12th century historian,Archbishop William of Tyre, tells us that ‘foremost and most distinguished’amongst these nine men ‘were the venerable Hugh de Payens and Godfrey de St.Omer.’3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1136]When the nine arrived in Jerusalem they were received as VIPs by the ‘CrusaderKing’ Baldwin I. They requested and were granted the right to use as theirheadquarters the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which lies on the south side of the ancientTemple Mount and still survives today. Traditionally held to have been the siteof the biblical Temple of Solomon, the Temple Mount also houses a secondsplendid Islamic shrine that the Templars now took control of as well – the Domeof the Rock. It too has survived the centuries and may be visited today. Itsfloor-plan forms a perfect octagon with all eight sides of equal length, itslofty walls rising to support a beautiful golden dome towering directly abovethe eponymous ‘Rock’. This is the gigantic slab of exposed bedrock that is heldin Judaic, Christian and Islamic tradition to have formed the original floor ofthe Holy of Holies of the Temple of Solomon. On it, the Old Testament tells us,once stood the Ark of the Covenant containing the tablets of the TenCommandments given to Moses by God – the god in question being Jehovah who theGnostics and their later successors the Cathars saw as the evil second-classdeity who had created the material world as a trap for souls. A Jewish traditionsays it was on this same rock that Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son, Isaac,on the instructions of Jehovah. For the Muslims it is the place from whence theProphet Muhammad made his night journey into heaven.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1137]Solomon's Temple was the First Temple of the Jews, and biblical archaeologiststoday generally agree with the tradition that it was sited on the Temple Mountand most likely on the spot where the Dome of the Rock now stands. It wasdestroyed by the Babylonians when they sacked Jerusalem in 587 BC but the SecondTemple was built on the same site between 537 and 517 BC after the return of theJews from their Babylonian exile.5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1138] In its turn the Second Temple wasdestroyed by the Romans in AD 70 and there has never subsequently been a Jewishplace of worship on the Temple Mount.This is why the famous ‘Wailing Wall’ has been of such enormous importance toJews down the ages and is today the single most important Jewish holy place. Itdates back to the time of the Second Temple, being part of a retaining buttressbuilt by Herod the Great in the late first century BC. It escaped demolition bythe Romans in AD 70 (because, says the Midrash, the ‘Divine Presence’ hoveredover it) and in later years it became a potent symbol of the nationalistaspirations of the Jewish people scattered in the diaspora.6[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1139]From AD 70, until Jerusalem was captured in AD 638 in the early Islamic jihads,we know little of the history of the Temple Mount. This is partly because of theconfusion of the period that saw the collapse of the Roman Empire and the rapidexpansion of Islam, and partly because the Islamic authorities controlling thesite do not permit archaeological investigations (although some illicit digshave taken place).7 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1140] Theirreluctance is perfectly understandable since the Dome of the Rock and theAl-Aqsa Mosque represent respectively (after Mecca and Medina) the third andfourth most sacred sites in the Islamic world.8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1141]Archaeologists believe that a Roman temple was built on the ruins of the SecondTemple after AD 70. Six centuries later, in AD 670, Caliph Umar, the successorto Prophet Muhammad and at that point the absolute ruler of Jerusalem, orderedthe Temple Mount cleared:… and a Moslem house of worship to be erected there, on the spot where Israel'sTemple had once stood.9 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1142]That same year a temporary wooden shrine was put up. Then in AD 691, during thereign of Caliph Abd al-Malik, the permanent structure of the Dome of the Rockthat we still see today was built. Under its huge gilded cupola it represented aunique concept in Islamic architecture of the period with its striking octagonalfloor-plan encompassing a circular central nave containing the sacred rock ofthe Temple of Solomon. Some decades later Abd al-Malik's son, Caliph Al-Walid,built the Al-Aqsa Mosque.10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1143] Therethen followed four centuries of relative peace under Islamic rule, rudelyinterrupted by the First Crusade and the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.The Christian crusaders were utterly ruthless, and a bloodbath ensued. Only theMuslim governor of the Holy City, Iftikhar ad-Daula, and his personal bodyguardwere allowed to leave in exchange for the city's treasure. ‘They were the onlyMuslims to escape with their lives’, reports author Piers Paul Read, in hisextensive study of the Knights Templar:Intoxicated by their victory, and still charged with the passion of battle, thecrusaders set about the slaughter of the city's inhabitants with the sameindifference to their victims’ age or sex … they were all killed.11[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1144]Raymond of Aguilers, the chaplain of Count Raymond IV of Toulouse, the leader ofthe crusaders, was a witness to the event. When visiting the Temple Mount he hadto wade through gore, flesh and blood that littered the streets:In all the streets and squares of the city, mounds of heads, hands and feet wereto be seen. People were walking over dead men and horses … what an aptpunishment! The very place that endured for so long blasphemies against God wasnow masked in the blood of the blasphemers.12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1145]At that point the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock and the whole of theTemple Mount came under Christian control and then, from 1119, under theexclusive control of the Knights Templar – hence, of course, their name.THE ROSY CROSS AND THE OCTAGONThe Templars signalled their affiliation to Christ by wearing a blood-red crossin the distinctive style known as croix pattée stitched to the white backgroundof their tunics – almost 500 years before the Rosicrucian Manifestos made afeature of a very similar ‘Rosy Cross’. But their identification with the Templeof Solomon was equally strong, as they demonstrated from the outset by choosingthe Temple Mount for their headquarters. Because the Dome of the Rock is anoctagonal structure they adopted the octagon as their symbol of this affiliationand their croix pattée was cunningly designed so that an octagon with all eightsides of exactly equal length like the floor-plan of the Dome of the Rock wasproduced by joining all the exterior points of the cross.One of the several puzzles surrounding the story of Templar origins is the speedwith which King Baldwin I of Jerusalem handed over the keys of the Al-AqsaMosque to the nine founder knights when they turned up on his doorstep in 1119.It would be a puzzle under all circumstances, but perhaps particularly so inthis case because, shortly before the Templars took possession, Baldwin had beenlovingly renovating the mosque for use as his own palace.13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1146] No matter how heavily armed andbattle-scarred these rather mysterious and impressive men were they were in noposition to threaten the ruler of Jerusalem, who controlled far larger forces.So we may only suppose that he delivered the sacred precinct to them voluntarily– in which case they must have been able to furnish him with the most persuasivereasons why he should do so.Once the Temple Mount was in their hands the knights lived, ate, slept andworked on this site sacred to three religions. They rarely left it during thenext seven years. In public pronouncements they had declared that their missionto the Holy Land was ‘to keep the road from the coast to Jerusalem free frombandits.’ They don't seem to have done that. Indeed, in the words of oneauthority, ‘the new Order apparently did very little’ in this period.14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1147] Besides simple logic suggeststhat nine men could hardly have protected anybody on a highway almost 50 mileslong – and their number stayed at nine until they were joined by the Count ofChampagne in 1125. Moreover the members of an older and far larger militaryorder – the Knights Hospitallers – were already doing the job of protectingpilgrims when the Templars arrived.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1148]Late in 1126 Hugh de Payens suddenly left Jerusalem and returned to Europeaccompanied by André de Montbard, another of the founders. De Montbard's nephewwas the renowned Catholic cleric Bernard (later Saint Bernard) of Clairvaux, whowas about to become the sponsor of the Templars. A staunch opponent of the earlyCathars, Bernard would subsequently lead a peaceful preaching campaign againstthem that took him deep inside Occitania in 1145 and subjected him to a numberof humiliations. For example, though he was known as the greatest preacher ofhis age and was accustomed to being mobbed by adoring crowds of thousands,Bernard only managed to attract an audience of 30 when he preached in the Catharcity of Albi.16 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1149] At Verfeil(northeast of Toulouse) mounted Cathar knights (they would, of course, have beencredentes, not perfecti sworn to nonviolence) are reported to have pounded onthe doors of a church where Bernard was attempting to preach and to have clashedtheir swords together so loudly that no one in the small congregation could heara word he said.17 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1150]So if anyone had a reason to hate the Cathars and want to punish them it wouldsurely be the Templars who owed so much to Saint Bernard. All the more difficultto understand therefore why the large numbers of Templars – who are known tohave occupied fortresses and preceptories throughout the length and breadth ofOccitania in the 12th and 13th centuries18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1151] – chose to step back from theAlbigensian Crusades that raged after 1209. The reader will recall from ChapterTwo that several times between campaigns the Catholic champion Simon de Montfortwas able to retain only skeleton forces – sometimes down to as few as a dozenknights – with which to preserve crusader gains in Occitania. Never once, so faras we have been able to establish, did the Templars intervene on his behalf orhelp him in any way in these periods of dire need.Why not?If they were exactly what they very much seemed and claimed to be in 1209 – i.e.Catholic knights dedicated to the service of the pope and to the destruction ofhis enemies – then surely the Templars should have been the first, not the last,to raise the sword of wrath against the heretics of Occitania?HUBRISHugh de Payens and André de Montbard arrived in France in 1127 and in January1128 participated in what was to be the most significant event in the earlyhistory of the Templars. That event was the Synod of Troyes, which had beenconvened with the explicit objective of procuring the Church's official backingfor the Templar order. Bernard of Clairvaux presided over the synod andpersonally drew up the formal ‘Rule of the Knights Templar’ that, henceforth,was to guide the evolution and development of the order. Thereafter in a seriesof sermons and glowing panegyrics such as De Laude Novae Militae (‘In Praise ofthe New Knighthood’) he vigorously promoted the young order – thus using his ownprestige and influence to guarantee its success.The results were spectacular. New recruits flocked in from all over France andlater from many other parts of Europe as well. Donations of land and money werereceived from wealthy patrons, and political power quickly followed. By the lastquarter of the 12th century the order had become phenomenally rich, wasoperating a sophisticated international banking system (that made use of thefirst ever ‘letters of credit’) and owned fortresses and a vast range ofproperties in many different lands.In the Holy Land the Templars’ military might, violence and aggression werelegendary, and their policy of ‘no retreat, no surrender’ often proveddevastating. Not unexpectedly, the Muslim forces developed a deep hate for themand a profound mistrust for their unchivalrous, not to say highly unChristian,behaviour towards their enemies and the civilian population.There is also the matter of the foolhardy bravado and greed of the KnightsTemplar – characteristics that eventually played in favour of the Muslims. Takefor example the siege of the stronghold fortress of Ascalon held by the caliphof Egypt. Because it was supplied by sea from Alexandria, and could not bestarved or deprived of provisions, the fortress had to be taken by directassault. On 15 August, the day of the Feast of the Virgin, forty Knights Templarled by Bernard de Trémélay placed a high tower against the walls of the fortressand managed to break into the Muslim stronghold. The rest of the Christian armyfailed to follow them, and the Templars were butchered – their heads cut off andtheir bodies thrown over the walls of the fortress.From there on everything began to go horribly wrong. On 4 July 1187, in the fullheat of the Levantine summer, the Knights Templar faced a large Muslim army inan arid and waterless region called the Horns of Hattin.The political and religious balance in the Holy Land, and eventually in thewhole of the Christian world, was about to change.THE HORNS OF HATTINThe leader of the Muslim army that the Templars were now about to engage on thatfateful day was the legendary Salah-ad-Din Yusuf ibn-Ayyub, better known asSaladin.19 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1152] This time the Templarswere contending with a military genius of high intelligence and wide educationand, most of all, with a cool mind and a perfect sense of timing.20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1153]Saladin was born in the city of Tikrit, in Iraq. As an aside, the reader may beinterested to note that Tikrit was also the birthplace of Saddam Hussein, theIraqi leader deposed by the US in 2003, a connection across the ages that didnot escape the attention of the Templar historian Piers Paul Read who commented,How many Arab leaders, one wonders, from Abdul Nasser to Saddam Hussein, haveaspired to become a latter-day Saladin, defeating the infidel invaders atanother Hattin or … driving them into the sea?21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1154]In his youth Saladin joined the service of Imad ad-Din Zengi, the ruler ofSyria, and was appointed commander of Zengi's fortress in Baalbek in Lebanon. In1146 Imad ad-Din died and was replaced by his son, Nur al-Din, under whomSaladin also served until he himself became vizier of Egypt in 1169 and, in1171, proclaimed himself first Ayyubid sultan of Egypt.According to his biographers Saladin was familiar with Euclid, the Almagest,mathematics, law and, more especially, the Koran. He also had an excellentknowledge of the history of the Arabs and was an expert on the pedigree ofArabian horses. What is generally remembered of this semi-legendary man,however, is his ‘exquisite courtesy’ and his clemency towards his enemies.22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1155] In his court, camp, or on thebattlefield, Saladin was the epitome of chivalry, and his Arab roots imposed onhim rules of hospitality and politeness that not only baffled his enemies butalso earned him immense respect throughout the Muslim world and Christendom. Inthe aftermath of the Battle of Hattin, for example, his forces captured Guy ofLusignan, the young and handsome king of Jerusalem. Learning that Guy was closeto death from exhaustion and thirst, Saladin had him brought to his tent andpersonally offered him a cup of cool water scented with roses, a gesture thatalso meant in Arab warfare that Guy's life would be spared and he would betreated in the manner appropriate to his high title. ‘A king does not kill aking’ Saladin told the bemused Christian leader.In early 1187 Saladin was in command of a massive Muslim army with which he nowfelt ready to strike a death blow to the Christian crusaders who controlledJerusalem and most of the Holy Land. On 1 July Saladin crossed the Jordan with30,000 soldiers and 12,000 cavalry. In a swift assault he took the town ofTiberias, the stronghold of the prince of Galilee, the Christian knight CountRaymond III of Tripoli. This was a ruse to draw the Christian knights away fromJerusalem and into open battle near Tiberias. Raymond was in Acre with King Guyat the time; his wife, Eschiva, countess of Tripoli, who was still in Tiberiashad taken refuge in the citadel and managed to send word to Raymond. Tornbetween saving the countess and saving the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, Raymondadvised King Guy not to march to Tiberias to engage Saladin in open battle, butto protect Jerusalem instead. Guy did not agree. Listening more to the advice ofReginald de Châtillon and Gérard de Ridefort, the Templar Grand Master, whoaccused Raymond of cowardice and screamed for revenge against Saladin, Guyfoolishly ordered the knights and the army to march towards Tiberias.In the heat of full summer, riding in the semi-arid region of the Negev desertwearing their heavy armour and laden with weapons, the Christians were alreadyexhausted and parched when they reached the village of Lubia which had a waterwell. But the well was dry, and so the Christian army camped on the waterlessplateau of the Horns of Hattin. To make matters worse, the Muslims set fire tothe dry scrub upwind, sending smoke into the Templars’ camp. At dawn Saladinordered the attack. Frenzied by thirst, heat and the infuriating smoke, theChristians attempted a mad rush against the Muslim phalanx, resulting in all ofthem getting killed or taken prisoners. Raymond charged with his knights andmanaged to find himself on the other side of the Arab army. Realising thefutility of his act, he fled to Tripoli. The remaining Christian forces made acircle around King Guy to protect him, and attempted several sorties against theMuslims, all of which failed.23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1156]With a few hours, after heavy losses, Guy and the rump of his army were takenprisoner.As we saw earlier, Saladin showed clemency to Guy. The other knights wereoffered the choice of conversion to Islam or death by beheading. Most zealouslyopted for the latter, the gruesome task executed with glee by Sufi fanatics inSaladin's entourage. Saladin himself decapitated the insolent and very arrogant– not to mention bloodthirsty – Reginald de Châtillon in front of the horrifiedeyes of King Guy who now feared for his own life. This was the moment whenSaladin uttered the famous words cited earlier: ‘A king does not kill a king,but that man's [de Châtillon's] perfidy and insolence went too far.’ Saladinalso spared the life of Gérard de Ridefort, the Grand Master of the Templars –not out of compassion but to use him as leverage in his parleys with otherTemplar strongholds. Within weeks Saladin had taken the fortified towns of Acre,Nablus, Sidon, Ascalon, Jaffa, Beirut and Sidon. Only Tyre resisted. Bymid-September Saladin was ready to go for the ultimate prize, the ‘World Cup’ ofall crusading wars – Jerusalem.We recall the great importance that Muslims everywhere accord to Jerusalem'sTemple Mount (Al-Haram al-Sharif). This is because of the belief that in AD 621Muhammad rode a winged-horse called the Buraq24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1157] and flew at night from Makkah(Mecca) to the Temple Mount. Known as Lailat al-Miraj (the ‘Night of theAscension’), this is regarded as one of the most significant events in Islam.25[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1158] The ‘Night’ starts at Makkah,with the Prophet Muhammad resting in the Ka'aba, the cubical shrine that isregarded as Islam's most holy place. Here the Archangel Gabriel appears andgives Muhammad the Buraq. Muhammad then mounts the Buraq which takes him to the‘farthest mosque’, which Muslims believe to be the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.There Muhammad prays. He then flies again on the Buraq to reach ‘heaven’, wherehe speaks to the earlier prophets such as Abraham, Moses and Jesus. TheArchangel Gabriel then takes him to see Allah (God). Allah instructs Muhammadthat Muslims must pray fifty times a day. Moses urges Muhammad to ask Allah fora ‘reduction’. This Muhammad does several times until the number is reduced tofive prayers a day. Muhammad then returns to Makkah and tells his story to abemused population who go to Abu Bakr, Muhammad's loyal companion, and say:‘Look at what your companion is saying … he went to Jerusalem and came back inone night!’ Abu Bakr replies: ‘If he said this, then it is true. I believe him…’ Because of this, Abu Bakr earned his celebrated epithet of Al-Saddiq, the‘Believer’.With such a heritage to reclaim, we can imagine what Saladin and his men musthave felt as they stood before the walls of Jerusalem in late September 1187pitting their religious convictions against those of the whole of Christendom.Although no magical winged-horse had carried Saladin here, the Muslims heldtheir breath and hoped with all their fervour that he, too, would soon pray onthe sacred rock as did the Prophet Muhammad on that night of nights nearly sixcenturies before.TONIGHT I WILL PRAY IN JERUSALEM!A few weeks before the battle for Jerusalem, during the siege of Tyre, theChristian baron, Balian de Ibelin (whom the Arabs regarded as equal to a‘king’), asked Saladin for a safe conduit into Jerusalem so that he could bringhis family out. Saladin agreed on condition that Balian swear an oath not takeup arms against him and not stay more than a day in the city. The oath wassworn, but once inside Jerusalem, Queen Sibylla, (King Guy's ambitious wife),and Heraclius, the patriarch,26 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1159]persuaded Balian to break his word to Saladin and stay to take control of thedefence.The conditions in the city were terrible. Hardly a handful of knights remained(some sources say only two, others say fourteen). Balian was forced to ‘create’another sixty knights chosen from among his soldiers.By 20 September 1187 Saladin was at the walls of Jerusalem. Through themediation of an Eastern Orthodox Christian clergyman, Yussef Bateet,negotiations were opened between Saladin and Balian. Saladin said that he wantedto take the city without shedding any blood. Balian vowed to fight to the deathrather than hand Jerusalem over to the Muslims.A siege followed. Arab archers rained arrows down into the city. Huge catapultshurled heavy stones and Greek fire. Part of the city wall was breached on 29September. The breach was strongly defended but the Arab numbers wereoverwhelming. Realising that end was near27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1160] Balian threatened to have theDome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque destroyed and the city burnt.Further parley brought agreement from Saladin to be paid a ransom of 10 dinarsfor each man, 5 dinars for each woman and 1 dinar for each child. Funds from thecity's treasury were used for those who could not pay, thus securing the freedomof a further 7,000 inhabitants. On 2 October came the formal surrender; Balianpersonally handed over the keys to the Tower of David, the citadel. A calm anddisciplined evacuation of Jerusalem then took place, with the surviving KnightsTemplar and Knights Hospitaller leading two columns and Balian and Heracliusleading a third column. Saladin even allowed Heraclius to take a number ofchurch treasures and reliquaries along.That same evening, as the refugees still streamed away, Saladin enteredJerusalem in triumph amid shouts of a ‘Allah'u Akbar!’ (‘God is Great!’)A curtain had fallen on the crusaders’ dream and Christendom's love affair withJerusalem. A strange kind of hush, a dark mood of despair and confusion, fellover the Catholic pope in Rome and Catholic kings across Europe.THE DEATH BLOW TO THE TEMPLARS IN THE HOLY LANDThe Templars clung on to some parts of the Holy Land for another century. Theirfinal downfall came in the spring of 1290, when an Egyptian army led by CaliphAl-Mansur Qalawun and his son, Al-Ashraf Khalil, moved to lay siege to the cityof Saint-Jean d’Acre (the modern Acre) which was in the hands of the crusadingknights and regarded as the last bastion of the so-called crusading Christianstates.With its fortified wall and its back to the sea, Acre's reputation as a crusaderstronghold was legendary. But now, after almost three centuries of warfarebetween Christians and the Muslims, the bulk of the crusading states had beenseverely weakened. Undermanned and drastically low on supplies, Acre was aboutto face the full brunt of the Muslim forces. There was a moment of hope when itwas announced that Caliph Qalawun had suddenly died, as though felled by thehand of God, just before reaching the walls of Acre. But his son and successorAl-Ashraf Khalil, kept a cool head and immediately took control of the Arabarmy, By 6 April 1290 Acre was thoroughly under siege, with the only way outbeing from the sea.Within the high walls the knights braced themselves for the worst, as it was nowclear to all just how massively the Arabs outnumbered them. There were terriblescenes of panic as the populace scrambled for places on the few ships available,and many old people and children drowned in the mad scuffle to evacuate thedoomed city. On 15 May the Arabs breached the walls and stormed inside. An awfulcarnage ensued, even by medieval standards. The Knights Templar fought to thelast like mad lions, knowing full well the gruesome fate that awaited them ifthey were captured alive. Amazingly, they held on in a redoubt for a furthertwelve days and when the fighting was finally over the city looked like a giantbutcher's floor.Infuriated by the insane resistance of the Templars, Al-Ashraf Khalil orderedAcre razed to the ground and all prisoners – male and female, young and old,civilian or military – put to death ‘under the Prophet's sword’. The Church ofSt. Andrew, renowned throughout Christendom, was demolished; its heavy Gothicdoor, weighing several tons, was taken as booty to Cairo to adorn the mausoleumof Al-Ashraf Khalil's brother. As the Arabs rode off from the smoldering stenchand the terrible carnage, the already dark and somber mood of the Christianworld deepened. The adventure of the crusades, of heroic tales and gallantry to‘protect’ the Holy Land from the ‘heathen’, was finally over.NEMESISThe fall of Acre marked the beginning of the end for the Templars. Within lessthan a decade of the disaster most of the knights had returned to Europe. Somewent to England, where they were absorbed by the many long-established Templarpreceptories there. The order's headquarters in England was located in Londonjust north of the Thames to the east of Holborn in the district that is stillcalled ‘Temple’ today. Some of the returning Templars went to Germany and toSpain. Many went to France, particularly to Paris and to the Port of La Rochellewhere again, there were large numbers of existing Templar institutions toreceive them. Thousands also chose to settle in Occitania which, by 1300, wasincreasingly being absorbed into France, and which had hosted a strong andcontinuous Templar presence for more than 150 years.By the beginning of the 14th century the papacy's long and corrupt dependence onthe French crown to provide a ‘final solution’ to the problem of the Catharheresy had not only resulted in the annexation of Occitania into France but alsoin a steady diminution in the powers of the pope. So much was this the case thatfrom 1309 until 1377 (a period referred to by Catholic historians as the‘Babylonian Captivity’), the papacy was not based in Rome but in Avignon whereit was almost totally under the control of the French monarchy.The pope who made the move to Avignon in 1309 was Clement V. Formerly RaymondBertrand de Got, archbishop of Bordeaux, he was elected pope in 1305 and crownedat Lyons in the presence of King Philip IV of France, known as Philip the Fair.Two years later Clement laid grave charges of heresy against the Templars andauthorized Philip to bring the knights to trial. The charges were in many casesidentical to those that had been repeatedly brought against the Cathars by theInquisition during the 13th century and included accusations of secretceremonies in which initiates were required to spit on or break crosses –accusations that aroused feelings of righteous horror amongst orthodoxCatholics.Thus it was that on Friday 13 October 1307 all members of the order within reachof Philip's forces – including all the Templars in Occitania – were arrested.Since more than 15,000 of them were rounded up in this way it is clear that theoperation must have been exceptionally well-planned and well-coordinated, andimplemented by large numbers of the king's men. We know that simultaneous dawnswoops on hundreds of Templar properties were carried out and that in most casesthe arrests were secured without a struggle.28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1161]In the months that followed, the Templars were savagely tortured by theInquisition. And as with the Cathars before them, and Bruno after them, thistorture – which was of exceptional brutality, even by Inquisition standards –was specially authorized by the pope. Moving quickly to follow up the arrests inFrance, Pope Clement V also issued a bull, Pastoralis praeeminentiae, dated 22November 1307, which ordered the arrest of all other Templars throughout theChristian world. Proceedings followed as far afield as England, Spain, Germany,Italy and Cyprus and, in 1312, another bull from the puppet pope, Vox inexcelso, officially suppressed the order. Meanwhile thousands of Templars weresubjected to the most gruesome tortures and many were subsequently burned at thestake.The agonizing death of the last Grand Master of the Templars, Jacques de Molay,came on 18 March 1314, and was recorded for posterity by a monk who was aneyewitness to the event:At the hour of vespers [late afternoon], on a small island on the Seine situatedbetween the gardens of the king and the church of St. Augustine, they [GrandMaster Jacques de Molay and the Templar Preceptor of Normandy, Geoffroi deCharnay] were condemned to be burnt … They were seen so resolute to endure theordeal of the fire, with such willingness, that they gained the admiration andsurprise of all who witnessed …29 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1162]Such descriptions inevitably remind us of the calm fortitude of the Catharperfecti when they faced similarly terrible deaths at the stake, and later ofGiordano Bruno, the Hermetic magus who was burned for his beliefs in Rome inFebruary 1600. But Jacques de Molay was a fighting man and he went out fighting.Twisting in horrible pain as he roasted in the midst of a slow fire, the lastTemplar Grand Master found the strength to call down a curse on the Frenchmonarchy for 13 generations and to prophesy that Clement V and Philip the Fairwould both meet him for judgement before the throne of God within the year.Weirdly Clement V died just one month later, in April 1314, and Philip the Fairdied inexplicably in November 1314.30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1163] The climax of the story comesmany generations later with the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 andthe public beheading by guillotine of the unfortunate Louis XVI in 1793.Allegedly as the king's head rolled into the basket a French Freemason dartedforward, dipped his fingers in the blood and scattered it over the crowd,shouting: ‘Jacques de Molay, thou art avenged!’31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1164]TEMPLAR SURVIVALS AND THE LONG QUEST FOR UTOPIAWhen Jacques de Molay was burned in 1314 many say that the Templars ceased toexist. This is true in the legal sense, for the order was suppressed. Butpractically speaking it did survive in a number of places. One was the Scotlandof Robert the Bruce which liberated itself from English occupation at the Battleof Bannockburn in 1314. Another was Portugal where the Templars were tried butfound to be free of guilt, and thus neither tortured nor imprisoned. There,though their order was officially dissolved in 1312 as elsewhere, it was able toreconstitute itself under a different name – the Militia of Jesus Christ (alsoknown as the Knights of Christ or the Order of Christ).32[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1165]A persistent rumour down the centuries hints at a great mystery concerning thelarge and well-appointed Templar fleet that had been anchored in the FrenchAtlantic port of La Rochelle on the night of 13 October 1307 when the mass ofTemplars were rounded up. Historians accept that the fleet was there the daybefore but gone the next morning, eluding the king's forces that came to takepossession of it. Clearly, therefore, good numbers of Templars – enough at anyrate to man and sail the fleet – did escape arrest in France.But where did they go? On this there is no concensus. One theory has it that theTemplars sailed to North Africa to join forces with their long-time enemies, theMuslims. Another theory has them discovering the Americas almost two centuriesbefore Columbus. A third theory, not necessarily inconsistent with the latter aswe shall see, has them sailing to Scotland and taking refuge amongst the largenumber of Templars already established in that country.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1166] There according to 18th centuryMasonic sources such as the Chevalier Ramsay and the Baron von Hund, they formedthe core of the underground movement that would eventually blossom forth againas Freemasonry.34 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1167]There is a particularly strong association linking the Templars in Scotland,Scottish Freemasonry and the ancient Sinclair family of Rosslyn near Edinburgh.A thorough study of the subject was published by Andrew Sinclair in 1991 underthe title The Sword and The Grail.35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1168] It presents compelling evidencethat Sir William Sinclair, who began construction of the spectacular Gothicchapel at Rosslyn around 1446, was himself secretly initiated as a Templar morethan 130 years after the suppression of the order and was at the same time thehereditary Grand Master of Freemasonry in Scotland.36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1169]Equally intriguing from our point of view is the evidence also presented in TheSword and The Grail of a voyage made to the northeast coast of America around1398 – 9 by William's grandfather Prince Henry Sinclair, First Earl of Orkneyand also an initiated Templar. This precocious voyage appears to have beenpartly memorialized in reliefs at Rosslyn Chapel, dated prior to 1450 (thusstill more than 40 years before Columbus) that show American maize and aloecactus.37 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1170] Since 1991, so much newhistorical and archaeological evidence has been brought forward in support ofthis general thesis that it is no longer, so far as we are aware, seriouslydisputed by scholars.What is more remarkable is the evidence that Andrew Sinclair managed to unearthregarding the motive for Prince Henry's transatlantic expedition:There is little doubt that the Knights Templar wanted to create another Paradiseand Temple of Solomon in the New World beyond the reach of Papal authority.38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1171]Sinclair's research suggests that the underground remnants of the Templar orderin Scotland at the end of the 14th century saw Prince Henry's pioneering voyageas the first step in the implementation of a long-term plan to establish autopia. It was, in other words, a bold and very early attempt to put into actionwhat would again be envisaged more than 200 years later by men like Campanella,Andreae and Bacon as the ideal solution to the repulsive corruption andentanglements of the Old World.Of course it's possible that the actual adventure of a trans-Atlantic voyage inthe late 14th century, and the philosophical adventures of the 17th century,could have occurred entirely independently of each other. But the involvement ofpowerful Templar symbolism in both periods makes us think otherwise. It is notonly the recurrence of the Rosy Cross (which also appears on the tombstone ofWilliam Sinclair at Rosslyn).39 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1172]Equally indicative of a link is the way in which the early explorers and thelater philosophers were all inclined to express their mission in terms ofexactly the same intent (whether symbolic or otherwise) – i.e. to rebuild the‘Temple of Solomon in the New World’.For a variety of reasons which need not detain us here, Prince Henry Sinclair'svoyage was not followed up in the way that the later voyages of Columbus wereinstantly followed up.40 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1173] Thechance was lost. But the big question is this. At the end of the 18th century,when the opportunity to create a genuinely new and revolutionary society builton new principles offered itself a second time with the American War ofIndependence and the vision of a free and independent United States, how can itpossibly be an accident that Templar symbolism was once again involved?We'll return to this problem in Chapter Nineteen. Meanwhile a more pressing andso far unaddressed issue demands our attention here.How were the Templars transformed from the pope's chosen warriors in the 12thcentury into heretics who had to be burnt at the stake in the early 14thcentury?The scholarly consensus, much of which makes a great deal of sense, is that theround-up of the Templars in 1307 was motivated almost entirely by King Philipthe Fair of France, who trumped up the accusations of heresy against them, andhad his puppet pope condemn them, so that he could steal their vast wealth.Since he did in fact steal much of their wealth, and since we know that ClementV did everything Philip told him, this is generally a very plausible scenario.We disagree fundamentally on one point, however, which is the widely acceptedidea that the accusations of heresy against the Templars were trumped up. Farfrom that, our proposal is that they very likely were heretics, guilty ascharged, and that what had turned them into secret warriors against the Churchwas their long exposure to Cathar culture in Occitania and the return there fromthe Holy Land of many of the knights at the end of the 13th century.TEMPLARS AND CATHARSLooking at the dualist doctrines of the Cathars and at what is known about theinitiations and beliefs of the Order of the Temple, Sir Steven Runciman notes:It may be that the secret practices of the Templars … were partly based onDualist ideas and usages …41 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1174]It is generally accepted that the Templars were exposed to such ideas in theHoly Land – for example through their contacts with members of the ancient sectknown as the Druze. Still extant today in Lebanon, Syria and Israel, the Druzeare technically Shi'a Muslims but their beliefs have been characterised as ‘amixture of Judaism, Christianity and Islam [including] elements ofGnosticism.’42 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1175] Other Shi'asplinter groups in the region such as the Nusayris also held beliefsidentifiably tinged with Gnosticism.43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1176] The Templars would have beenwell-placed during their long stay in the Holy Land to encounter the descendantsof the Sabians of Harran, the compilers of the great Hermetic text known as thePicatrix – which contains, as we saw in Chapter Eight, an early blueprint forthe utopian Hermetic city.Having absorbed esoteric ‘Eastern’ influences far more enthusiastically than anyother crusading group it is difficult to imagine that the large numbers ofTemplars resident in Occitania from the 12th to the 14th century were unaware ofthe distinctly Gnostic and dualist flavour of the local Cathar religion. It alsomakes sense, if their own thinking was already tinged by dualism as Runcimanspeculates, that they might have been favourably predisposed towards the Catharcause – particularly so if the noble families of Occitania who were united intheir support for the Cathars were also supporters of the Templars. This ishighly likely. Indeed, as a leading authority on the Templars, historian MartinBarber, points out, the great expansion that the Templars enjoyed in Occitaniacould not have been achieved without strong support from the nobles:The establishment of new communities, and the opening up of previouslyuncultivated territory which was common in the 12th century owed much to analliance between the nobles’ land and the Order's capital …44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1177]Simple logic suggests that if the Cathars were sponsored by the noble familiesof Occitania, as we know they were, and if the Templars were sponsored by thesame noble families of Occitania, as we know they were, then the Cathars andTemplars are likely to have been on friendly terms. This could explain why evenat the outset of the Albigensian Crusades in 1209, called by a pope – InnocentIII – who was known to favour the Templars and who had accorded them specialprivileges,45 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1178] we find theTemplars peculiarly reluctant to aid Innocent's cause.46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1179] There is no suggestion that theKnights had become heretics themselves by this stage, but it is obviouslypuzzling that one of the few duties these heavyweight fighters did during theAlbigensian Crusades was very far from being a ‘front-line’ one. In 1212, to payfor the costs of the Crusade, the pope imposed a tax of three pence perhousehold across the length and breadth of the Languedoc. The Templars collectedit but otherwise, notes historian Aubrey Burl, they remained neutral.47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1180]Such ‘neutrality’ amongst the pope's own chosen warriors in so crucial a holywar is highly anomalous and, in our opinion, significant. Several researcherspursuing this line of investigation have argued that as the Albigensian Crusadestook their toll, and in particular after the fall of the last major Catharfortress at Montségur in 1244, the Knights Templar became less ‘neutral’ andwere increasingly influenced by Cathar doctrines. This happened says AndrewSinclair, because:… most of the Cathar knights who escaped the slaughter were received into theMilitary Order of the Temple of Solomon, which was itself permeated withoriental influences.48 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1181]Similarly Arthur Guirdham sees ‘indications of some connection between theCathars and the Templars’ in the fact that:A large number of Templar knights were recruited from Languedoc. There was aninflux of recruits in the mid-13th century when the Albigensian wars were to allintents and purposes over. It is significant that the immensely powerful andubiquitous Order of the Temple took no part in the Crusade against theAlbigensians.49 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1182]Evidence of this sort is irritatingly and elusively circumstantial –‘interesting, presumptive, but not conclusive’, as Guirdham admits.50[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1183] On the other side of the debate,however, historian Martin Barber is much more assertive:Romantics like to see connections between the two [i.e. between the Cathars andthe Templars] but there were none: no fabulous treasure passed on to theTemplars after the fall of the Cathar fortress of Montségur in 1244, no sharedanti-Christian beliefs pervaded by esoteric cults … Inevitably some of theaccusations against the Templars derive from those against the Cathars – theywere, after all, embedded in the minds of those who pursued dissent.51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1184]Barber's argument, though reasonable, seems to us weakened by his evident desirenot to be a ‘romantic’ and thus not to find a conspiracy in anything. In thecase of organisations like the Templars and the Cathars, which were forced to besecretive and conspiratorial by the circumstances of the times, such a policycould be a mistake. If, for example, Cathar knights after Montségur had soughtand been granted shelter by the Templars would we honestly expect to findrecords of this – let alone records of the transfer of any ‘treasure’? Wouldthese hypothetical fugitives, joining a religious military order that wasalready notorious for its secrecy and weirdness by 1244, have left a paper trailfor the Inquisition, and later historians, to follow? It seems most unlikely.On the other hand the hypothesis that the Templars were increasingly influencedby Cathar-dualist ideas from the mid-13th century onwards has much to recommendit – not least because it makes better sense than Barber's explanation of thecharges of heresy that were brought against the order in the early 14th century.The reader will recall that one of the sensational indictments was that Templarinitiates were required to spit on or break crosses. Such behaviour, thoughseemingly bizarre or diabolical, is entirely consistent with the Cathar religionwhich denied the physical incarnation of Christ, disbelieved in the Crucifixion,and regarded veneration of the cross as a form of idolatry andtorture-worship.52 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1185]Seen from the perspective of the Inquisition – and of the French crown – thehuge influx of heavily-armed and battle-proven Templars returning to theLanguedoc in the last years of the 13th century after the loss of the Holy Landmay well have looked threatening. Depending on the level of suspicion with whichthe permanent Templar population of the region was already regarded – fuelledperhaps by rumours that fugitive Cathars had joined Templar ranks – this quantumleap in the order's local military strength could well have been regarded asextremely dangerous by the secular and religious powers. Their suspicions,moreover, are likely to have been intensified by what they would have regardedas the most unwelcome signs of a Cathar revival led by the Perfectus PierreAutier that began in 1299 (see Chapter Seven).Once all these factors are taken into account, we propose that the perceivedthreat of a renascent Catharism supported by the armoured might of a Templarorder now ‘lost to heresy’ is sufficient on its own to explain the sudden movethat Philip and the Church made against the order in 1307. Whether there was anyreal substance to the perceived threat is another matter, but it isinconceivable that king and pope would have conspired to bring down the Templarsat this exact moment when Catharism was in its death struggle without connectingthe two matters together in their minds.53[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1186] That is not to say that greed forthe wealth of the Templars played no part in their decisions and actions. With aman like Philip, greed always played a part. But our point is that greed was notthe only factor, nor perhaps even the main factor. What happened to the Templarsbetween their arrest in 1307 and the burning of their last Grand Master in 1314may be best understood as it was understood then – i.e. as yet another battle inthe war against heresy and social revolution that the Church had waged since thetime of Constantine the Great.ELEMENTS OF THE TEMPLAR HERESYAn argument can be made against any kind of secret association between theCathars and the Templars on the grounds that their beliefs were fundamentallyincompatible. While the latter took pride in the Old Testament symbolism of theTemple of Solomon, the former abhorred and opposed the Old Testament as the bookof the evil demiurge.This objection, though obvious, is irrelevant to the hypothesis being putforward here. We are not claiming that the Templars were influenced by Catharismin the early years of their existence – when they occupied the Temple Mount inJerusalem between 1119 and 1187 and adopted the octagonal floor-plan of the Domeof the Rock as their fundamental symbol. Our proposal is that this influence mayhave begun to be felt during the 12th century, through the many Templarpreceptories in Occitania, but that it did not have a significant impact untilwell into the 13th century when, as several historians believe, fugitive Catharknights were absorbed into the order. We speculate that the process wasaccelerated after 1290, with the influx of returning Templars from the HolyLand, but that before it could reach critical mass it was interrupted by thepre-emptive strike of Philip the Fair and Clement V in 1307.Another claim that we are not making is that the Templars had become Cathars.Our hypothesis is that by 1307 Cathar dualism was one amongst a number ofingredients in a probably multi-faceted Templar heresy that had brought togethera potpourri of seeming incompatible religious ideas. In a way the heretics whothe Templars most remind us of are not so much the Cathars as the warrior sectof Christian Gnostics known as the Paulicians (see Chapter Five) who displayedthe same fearlessness and willingness to kill. It is also widely recognised thatthe unique and idiosyncratic Templar religion was tinged with aspects ofesoteric Islam and mystical Judaism that the order had picked up in the HolyLand.The Judaic element meshed particularly well with the Knights’ own originalobsession with the Temple of Solomon and would have continued to be available tothem in Occitania through the large and long-established Jewish communities thatwe know were also resident there at the time. These communities had an honouredplace in Occitan society in the 12th and 13th centuries until the AlbigensianCrusades destroyed the region's heterodox and tolerant way of life forever.Acclaimed schools of Talmudic law flourished at Narbonne, Lunel and Beaucaireand there is a report from 1160 that Jewish students travelled from ‘distantlands’ to study at them.54 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1187]In addition, as we saw in Chapter Two, the important branch of esoteric Judaismand mystical cosmic speculation known as the Cabala was developed amongst thescholarly Jews of Occitania's coastal cities between in the 12th and 13thcenturies55 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1188] – again overlappingwith the Cathars and the Templars in the same area. We cited Benjamin ofTudela's 12th century description of a Jew at Lunel who had ‘discarded allworldly business, studied day and night, kept fasts, and never ate meat’.56[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1189] Since this suggests that Catharideas about how we should live in the world and what we are doing here had begunto influence the Occitanian Jews, why should not the occult philosophy of theCabala, elaborated by Occitania's Jewish savants, have likewise influenced theCathars – and the Templars?EMANATIONS AND THE SEPHIROTHIC TREECatharism was a revival, which took root in Occitania in the 12th century (andin the Balkans somewhat earlier) of Christian Gnostic heresies that had lastflourished in Palestine and Alexandria in the first four centuries AD. It is aremarkable coincidence that Cabalism likewise is a revival, which took root inOccitania in the 12th century, of schools of Jewish mysticism that had lastflourished in Palestine and in Alexandria in those same first four centuries.57[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1190] And although the revival ofHermeticism did not come until the recovery of the Hermetic texts in the 15thcentury, those texts too had their origin in those first four centuries – and,moreover, in the same predominantly Alexandrian milieu that nourished Gnosticismand the schools of Jewish mystical speculation.A central concept shared by all the dualist religions that we traced in Part Iis that of emanation. In the simplest possible terms it is conceived of as aconscious or unconscious creative act of the pure and unassailable spiritualgodhead forming manifestations of him/her/itself that then pursue an independentexistence. The Gnostics of the first four centuries AD called these emanationseons. They were ranked in order of their degree of selfknowledge and they werefrequently given abstract characters such as ‘Silence’, ‘Intellect’, ‘Truth’,‘Wisdom’, and so on.58 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1191]Together the godhead and the eons formed the Pleroma – literally the ‘Fullness’– the perfect group. The process that led to the creation of the world resultedfrom a fall within the Pleroma usually caused by curiosity or desire on the partof one of the eons.59 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1192] The readerwill recall that in some Gnostic schemes Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament,was portrayed as the fallen eon, in others he was even less than that, reducedto the status of an emanation of an emanation – smart enough to create thematerial world but too stupid to remember where he had come from and what hisown small role really was in the scheme of things.60[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1193] Likewise the Cathars saw Jesusnot as the physical and material ‘son of God’, as the Christians did, but as adivine emanation.61 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1194]This concept of emanation is also fundamental to the Cabala. Here the text onwhich the 12th and 13th century Occitanian speculation was based was the SepherYetzirah (‘Book of Creation’), a Hebrew treatise on cosmogony and cosmologyoriginally compiled in the third century AD.62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1195] This work recounts a creative acton the part of the godhead manifesting ‘in ten distinct stages of emanation’corresponding with the numbers one to ten.63[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1196] These ten emanations, whichcombine alchemically with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet – the ‘languageof God’ – are known as the Sephiroth. Their order and qualities are as follows(1) Keter Elyon (Supreme Crown) or Ratzon (Will); (2) Chochmah (Wisdom); (3)Binah (Intelligence); (4) Chesed (Love) or Gedullah (Greatness); (5) Gevurah(Power) or Din (Judgement); (6) Tiferet (Beauty) or Rachamim (Compassion); (7)Netzach (Lasting Endurance); (8) Hod (Majesty); (9) Yesod Olam (Foundation ofthe World) or Tzaddik (Righteous One); (10) Malchut (Kingdom) or Atarah (Diadem)or Shekhina (Feminine Divine Presence).64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1197]As the Cabala was developed in the 12th and 13th centuries the Jewish mystics ofOccitania organized these ten Sephiroth into ‘a specific archetypal pattern’usually drawn as interlinked by a complex network of straight ‘branches’, or‘pathways’, or ‘columns’ or ‘pillars’:The pattern thus called forth is the model on which everything that is to comeinto manifestation is based. It has been named the Image of God, but it is moregenerally known as the Tree of Life.65[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1198]One might think of it as a diagram of the DNA structure of reality – intendednot as a literal ‘map of reality’ or representation of ‘what reality is made of’but as a mandala66 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1199] or talisman tobe used for focused mental exercise through which knowledge of the true natureof things can be reached.SEPHIROTHIC TREE AND TEMPLE OF SOLOMONLike other mandalas, the Sephirothic ‘Tree of Life’ is a geometrical pattern. Itfeatures three main vertical columns or pillars on which the ten Sephirothrepresenting the emanations of God are fixed like glass balls on a Christmastree. There is a significant interpenetration of symbolism here withFreemasonry. As we saw in Chapter Thirteen, Freemasons generally represent theTemple of Solomon by two pillars or columns, known as Boaz and Jachin (‘wisdom’and ‘power’) with the open corridor between the two pillars often considered asa ‘third’ pillar. Such imagery of two or three pillars, so close to the basicstructure of the Tree of Life, is frequently evoked in Masonic illustrations andcertificates.It is also commonly found in Rosicrucian symbolism67[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1200] and some researchers have evendetected it on the engraved title-page of Francis Bacon's The Advancement ofLearning. 68 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1201] This engraving,which appears in the 1640 edition, shows two pillars and beyond them the openocean with a ship sailing away.69 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1202]At the top of the left pillar is the symbol of the Sun and at the top of theright pillar is the symbol of the Moon – i.e. like the pillars in the Tree ofLife they are surmounted by globes. But this is also, unmistakably, the samemotif which is often seen in Masonic illustrations of Solomon's Temple, with thepillars Boaz and Jachin. One globe represents the visible world lit by the Sun,and the other globe the invisible or occult world under the glow of the Mooni.e. the secret world. Two hands, one extended from each of the globes, areclasped in what clearly seems to be a ‘Masonic handshake’. We are not alone innoting that this whole arrangement is suggestive of a Sephirothic Tree of Lifethat branches out into ‘Wisdom’, ‘Power’, ‘Intelligence’ and so forth.70[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1203]This same general pattern using symbols to denote the various Masonic ‘virtues’and the many paths to their attainment can be easily discerned in the so-calledtracing boards used by Freemasons to this day in rituals likened to entry to the‘spiritual Temple of Solomon’. At the foot of these ‘tracing boards’ is to beseen a representation of the two pillars, Boaz and Jachin, beyond them some sortof shrine, probably symbolising the Holy of Holies of Solomon's Temple, andoften represented by a pentagram or a ‘Blazing Star’. Behind the pentagram/stardevice are spread a variety of Masonic symbols the whole culminating at the topof the tracing board where we find the Supreme Being represented either by acrown (Keter in the Cabalistic Tree of Life also means ‘Crown’), or by the ‘allseeing eye’, or a glowing pyramid.That such symbolism is to be directly associated with the Tree of Life isconfirmed by the preparatory information given to Masonic candidates for theso-called 30th degree of the Scottish Rite, also known as the Knight Kadoshdegree, where a Sephirothic Tree is shown to the candidate along with a textualexplanation of its symbolic use. According to Masonic historian Robert Lomas:In the preparatory section ritual of the Knight Kadosh, (the 30th degree of theAncient and Accepted Scottish Rite and the first degree of the ChivalricSeries), the Candidate is given this information. This division of the tenSephiroth into three triads was arranged into a form called by the Kabbaliststhe Kabbalistic Tree, or the Tree of Life (as shown in the following TracingBoard) In this diagram the vertical arrangement of the Sephiroth is called –‘Pillars’. Thus the four Sephiroth in the centre are called the Middle Pillarthe three on the right, the Pillar of Mercy and the three on the left, thePillar of Justice.71 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1204]In chapter one of the Sepher Yetzirah it is stated that:Ten are the numbers of the ineffable Sephiroth, ten not nine, ten not eleven.Learn this wisdom and be wise in the understanding of it; investigate thesenumbers and draw knowledge from them; fix the design in its purity, and passfrom it to its creator seated on his throne …72[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1205]The Sepher Yetzirah also speaks of ‘the 32 most occult and wonderful paths ofwisdom’ on which ‘the Lord of Hosts engraved His Name’. These ‘32’ paths,pillars or columns in the design represent the ‘10 Sephiroth’ and the ‘22letters’ which are ‘the foundation of all things’.73[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1206] Thus the Sephirothic Tree, withits ‘22’ paths and ‘10 emanations’ also mystically connotes the number ‘32’. InScottish Freemasonry this represents the 32 ‘degrees’ that must be taken (i.e.‘pathways’ that must be followed) in order to reach the door of full Masonicenlightenment – the ultimate 33rd degree. The link we make here is confirmed bythe 33rd degree Scottish Rite author, Charles Sunmer Lobingier, who, in 1929,was commissioned by the Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite in Washington, DCto write an official history of this Masonic order:A later feature of the Kabala is the thirty-two paths of wisdom. The number isobtained by adding the letters of the Hebrew alphabet (twenty-two) to tenSephiroth, and here we doubtless have the origin of the number of degrees asformulated by the Grand Constitution [of the Scottish Rite] …74[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1207]THE PARADOXICAL KIRCHERThe belief that divine principles, emanations or archetypes can be made manifestin a ‘temple’ or ‘house’ of God – both in the material and in the spiritualsense – is at the very heart of the Tree of Life concept. But much earlier theancient Egyptians also designed their temples with precisely such a purpose inmind – think, for instance, of the great sacred precinct of Amun atKarnak-Luxor.The notion that the Egyptian esoteric design of temples could in some way beconnected to the Sephirothic Tree was developed as early as the 17th century bythe Hermetic-Cabalist and philosopher Athanasius Kircher in his book OedipusAegyptiacus. In this work Kircher, who was also (or seemed to be) a devoutJesuit, goes so far as to argue that all religions and all knowledge of thedivine originally came from Egypt.75[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1208] Joscelyn Godwin, professor ofmusic at Colgate University in New York, is a world-renowned authority onKircher and has this to say:Kircher derives all the wisdom of the Jews from Egypt, transmitted through theinitiate Moses. In The Tree of the Sephiroth we have the primary metaphysicalsymbol of the Hebrew Cabalists. It shows ten invariable archetypes linked toeach other by twenty-two paths corresponding to the twenty-two letters of theHebrew alphabet. Since the Tree is a diagram of the utmost universality, it maybe used as a key to the working of every level of the Universe … On thecosmological level, the lowest seven Sephiroth are the seven Chaldaean planets,and the upper triad, according to Kircher, the spheres of the fixed stars …76[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1209]In 1621, Athanasius Kircher, then a young novice in the Jesuit order, was forcedto flee Germany – his homeland – because of the outbreak of the Thirty Years WarHe eventually found his way into France and joined the Jesuit college atAvignon. A brilliant mathematician and accomplished linguist, Kircher developedan insatiable interest in all things Egyptian and in 1635 was given a post atthe Jesuit college in Rome to study hieroglyphs. In 1638 Kircher was madeprofessor of mathematics, but his scientific interests were wide and varied. Hisfame became such that scholars from all over the world corresponded with him andmany came to see him in Rome, such as the English inventor William Gascoignesand the French painter Nicolas Poussin, to whom he taught perspectives.77[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1210] Kicher was a keen collector ofantiquities, and was to establish one of Europe's first museums, the MuseoKircheriano which some compared ‘with Elias Ashmole's foundation in Oxford ofthe Ashmolean Museum.’78 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1211]Like Giordano Bruno before him Kircher was an all-out ‘Egyptian’ Hermetist who‘regarded Egyptian idolatry and polytheism as the source, not only of Greek andRoman religion, but of the later Hebrews.’79[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1212] Kircher also believed that Egyptwas the source of all civilisations and, more importantly, that all ancientphilosophies, and especially Hebrew Cabala, had been ‘derived from the Egyptianwisdom’ handed down in the Hermetic writings.80[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1213] Because of this, Frances Yatescalls Kircher the ‘most notable descendant of the Hermetic-Cabalist tradition’.Yates also comments that he was ‘much preoccupied with Isis and Osiris as thechief gods of Egypt.’81 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1214] In hisOedipus Aegyptiacus, Kircher reaches the following conclusion:The divine Dionysius testifies that all created things are nothing else butmirrors which reflect to us the rays of divine wisdom. Hence the wise men ofEgypt feigned that Osiris, having given charge of all things to Isis, permeatedinvisibly to the whole world. What else can this signify save that the power ofthe invisible God penetrates intimately into all?82[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1215]One of Kircher's closest friends was the great baroque architect Gian LorenzoBernini, who Christopher Wren met in France in 1665 at the court of Louis XIV.Bernini, Like Kircher, was (or seemed to be) an ardent Jesuit, and all his lifewould attend Mass every morning at the small church of Il Gesù in Rome, wherethe founder of the Jesuit order, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, was buried. Kircher'svast knowledge of perspective and of the symbolic use of architecture gave himmuch in common with Bernini, and they collaborated on several architecturalprojects for the pope in Rome. Notable amongst these was an ancient Egyptianobelisk (not to be confused with the Vatican obelisk described in ChapterThirteen) that they erected in the Piazza della Minerva where once had stood aTemple of Isis. It was in 1652, thus 13 years before Bernini met ChristopherWren in Paris, that Kircher published his Oedipus Aegyptiacus, a book that was abestseller in its days and widely read throughout Europe.Kircher's depiction of the Sepirothic Tree is identical to the portrayals in theHebrew Cabala with ten emanations interlinked by 22 pathways. But unlike others,Kircher saw the original source of the Cabalistic knowledge enshrined therein asbeing ‘Egyptian’. Could Kircher's ‘Egyptianised’ Hermetic-Cabalistic ideas ofsacred and symbolic architecture and perspectives somehow have reachedChristopher Wren and John Evelyn in England?JOHN GREAVES, THE PYRAMIDS AND GRESHAM COLLEGEIn considering this question we note that there is another possible ‘Egyptian’connection – again peculiarly involving Kircher – in Christopher Wren'sbackground.The reader will recall that Wren was appointed Savilian Professor of Astronomyat Oxford in 1661, right after the Restoration of Charles II.83[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1216] Prior to Wren's appointment, thepost had been occupied by Seth Ward, who held the position from 1649 to 1660.Before Ward the professor had been another eminent figure – John Greaves.Like Wren, Greaves had formerly taught mathematics at Gresham College in London.His stint there was from 1630 to 1637, after which he took a sabbatical in orderto make a rather unusual journey to Egypt, the main objective of which was toinvestigate the Pyramids of Giza. He hoped to find a ‘universal unit’ ofmeasurement encoded into these great structures. To this end he teamed up withan Italian scientist, Tito Livio Burattini whose sponsor was none other thanAthanasius Kircher.84 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1217]Burattini, although Italian by birth, was domiciled in Poland. He was a keenmathematician, astronomer and cartographer, but his real passion, likeKircher's, was ancient Egypt. Burattini was finally to travel there in 1637 withsupport from Kircher, a short while before Greaves himself arrived in Egypt. Inhis book Pyramidograhia, published in 1646, Greaves refers to Burattini as ‘aningenious young man from Venice’ and makes use of some of Burattini's drawingsof the pyramids.85 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1218]It was when Greaves returned to England in 1639 that he was rewarded for hisEgyptian endeavours with the post of Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford –the same post that Christopher Wren would eventually occupy in 1661.David Stevenson, professor of Scottish history at the University of St. Andrews,has discovered that Sir Robert Moray, the principal founder of the Royal Societyand the first man to be initiated into Freemasonry on English soil, also had aconnection with the ubiquitous Athanasius Kircher:In 1643 he [Robert Moray] was knighted by the king [Charles I] … Later in thatsame year he was captured by imperial forces while fighting for the French, andwas imprisoned in Bavaria. By 1645 he had been ransomed, having made use of hiscaptivity to develop his scientific interests through conversations andcorrespondence with Jesuit scholars, including the remarkable Hermetic polymathAthanasius Kircher who was a leading authority on the mysteries of ancientEgypt.86 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1219]There is, too, another common denominator to consider: Gresham College itself.Many of the protagonists associated with the Invisible College, the RoyalSociety and the early London Masonic lodges were directly or indirectly involvedwith Gresham College. These included Robert Moray, John Wilkins, ChristopherWren and Robert Hooke. The origins of this college go back to Sir ThomasGresham, the famous founder of the London Royal Exchange. In 1575 he bequeathedhis home in Bishopsgate to serve as headquarters for the college and leftprovision in his will for it to be funded in the future through revenues accruedby the Royal Exchange. The idea of such a college seems to be somewhat‘Masonic’, in the sense that Thomas Gresham decreed that seven ‘readers’ orscholars would be appointed to lecture on each of the seven liberal arts.87[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1220] Indeed, according to RobertLomas, Gresham College was ‘the main centre for Freemasonry in RestorationLondon … which Sir Thomas Gresham had set up to support his Masonic ideals ofstudy.’88 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1221]Could all these circumstances, as well as the encounter with Bernini in Paris,have brought Christopher Wren into contact with Kircher's Hermetic-Cabalisticideas and their application to geometrical design and structures such as theSephirothic Tree of Life? And if they had, might they have influenced Wren'splan for the rebirth of London after the Great Fire? We can only surmise thatthe opportunity was there for this to happen.Oddly enough, the same can also be said of John Evelyn, who presented his planfor a ‘new’ London just a couple of days after Wren. Evelyn, as we shall recall,had travelled to Europe between 1643 and 1652. He spent time in Rome during thisperiod where he is known to have developed a keen interest in Bernini and hisworks.89 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1222] It is by no meansimpossible that he might have seen or learnt something there, in the city whereGiordano Bruno had been burnt at the stake less than half a century before, thatsparked off Hermetic-Cabalistic ideas in his mind.MANY DIFFERENT STREAMS CONVERGING‘After the disappearance of Catharism and the Temple at the beginning of the14th century,’ Arthur Guirdham asks:… what outlet was there for those of a dualist tendency? One thing we can saywith certainty. By this time the dualists of Europe had learnt that the openprofession of their opinions was so hazardous as to be impracticable.90[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1223]In other words if religious teachings as contrary to Church dogma as those ofthe Cathars were in any way to survive the mindset of the Middle Ages they wouldhave to go underground, and to follow whatever further course of naturalevolution and development they could while remaining out of sight. We areconvinced that this happened and that dualist beliefs were sheltered andnourished beyond the view of the Inquisition and historians long after‘Catharism and the Temple’ had been officially destroyed. It seems to us thatthis process was dramatically catalysed and briefly brought out into the openagain by the recovery of the Hermetic Texts in 1460 and that afterwards anotherperiod of incredible openness, progress and revolutionary thinking followed. ButHermetists like Bruno, who pushed the revolution too quickly, died for theirbeliefs while other less hot-headed thinkers waited patiently for a better time.In the long years of waiting many different ideas, like many different streamsconverging, all become available to ‘those of a dualist tendency’. Included inthe mix were remnants of Cathar Gnosticism; Jewish mysticism and the Cabala; therecovered Hermetic revelations; Templar and Masonic notions about rebuildingSolomon's Temple; the Rosicrucian and ‘New Atlantean’ programme for an idealutopian city designed to bring harmony between heaven and earth; and last butnot least Tommaso Campanella's Civitas Solis, the Adocentyn of the Picatrix, tobe made ‘in such a wonderful way that only by looking at it all the sciences maybe learned.’91 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1224]All these elements and influences, we suggest, were at work in the mysteriouslysimilar city plans that Christopher Wren and John Evelyn prepared after theGreat Fire of London in 1666.WREN'S PLAN TO REBUILD THE TEMPLEThe Great Fire swept over the city of London like a giant blowtorch, clearing anarea one and a half miles long and half a mile wide. It destroyed almosteverything from Tower Hill in the east to Temple in the west, where it finallyburnt itself out in front of Temple Church, a distinctive round structure builtof stone in the Gothic style.The district where the Fire stopped – still known as ‘Temple’ and todayinhabited mainly by lawyers – is so named because of its historical associationwith the Knights Templar. It lies roughly between St. Paul's in the east andCovent Garden in the west, and is bracketed by Fleet Street in the north and theVictoria Embankment in the south. The Templars built their great preceptory(headquarters) of the New Temple here in 1161, providing themselves in theprocess with a pier on the River Thames and inland access for their ships allthe way to Newgate via the nearby River Fleet.92[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1225]Construction of Temple Church began in 1180. Like many other Templar places ofworship, its core structure was a circular building with a domed roof,reminiscent of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (the supposed tomb of Jesus) inJerusalem. Let us note in passing that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre lieswest of the site of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, an alignment, as we shall seelater, that did not go unnoticed by the Templars in London. Dedicated to theVirgin, Temple Church was consecrated on 10 February 1185 by Heraclius,patriarch of Jerusalem, who was brought to London for the purpose. This was justtwo years before the dramatic fall of Jerusalem to the ‘heathen’ forces of theArabs under Saladin in 1187.The district of Temple and Temple Church remained under the order's controluntil its suppression in 1307. In 1312 all Templar properties in London,including the round church, were handed over to the rival military Order of theKnights Hospitallers. When the Hospitallers were in turn suppressed during theReformation, the church and its surrounding buildings passed to the crown. Thebuildings were tenanted by lawyers – the benchers of the Inner Temple and theMiddle Temple – who secured the freehold by royal charter from James I in 1608.These two ‘Inns of Court’ have remained the owners of Temple Church ever sinceand are under an obligation by terms of their royal charter to maintain it andits services forever.93 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1226]In the plans that Wren and Evelyn drew up for London's architectural rebirthafter the Great Fire, both men paid inordinate attention the area around TempleChurch.Christopher Wren was first to get the king's attention. On 11 September 1666,with a blueprint tucked under his arm, he rushed to see Charles II at Whitehall.The blueprint was an amazingly detailed and professionally executed map for anew London, the sort of town-planning design project that should take weeks, ifnot months, to conceive and draft in final form. Yet barely a week had passedsince the Fire and there were still dozens of smoke plumes hanging over theskyline of the charred city.Wren's ideas combine a magnificent vision for a new capital city with anappreciation of sophisticated concepts in urban planning. His blueprint, whichhas survived, looks like the polished product of a highly-skilled team. Yet theevidence suggests that Wren did not consult his colleagues at the Royal Societyand worked alone on the plan.94 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1227]Was he trying to protect his ideas so that no one else could take the credit? Orwas he just in a tremendous hurry – out of a natural desire to be ‘first’?He could have had many motives for secrecy and speed, but what interests us moreare his motives and hopes for the new London.Freshly back from his eight months in Paris where he had studied neo-classicalarchitecture as well as new and daring city plans, Wren's dream was to replacethe winding streets and courtyards of the old medieval city with new monumentalavenues such as those he had seen in France. His plan is dominated by a maincentral avenue that runs virtually straight from one end of the city (Aldgate)to the other (the Strand), passing through a series of huge star-shaped plazasdistributed along the way. From these plazas numerous straight roads emanate inall directions, linking up to smaller piazzas or circuses on either side of themain axis to form a closed network. Wren's plan also features a secondmonumental avenue running from the Tower of London, along Cannon Street and upto St. Paul's.95 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1228] This secondavenue merges with the main axis coming from Aldgate, and the whole is thenprolonged to Ludgate to become Fleet Street.It is at this point, just past Ludgate – and not far from Temple Church – that amajor feature of Wren's plan stands out: a large open plaza in the form of anoctagon with all eight sides of equal length. Wren's established Masonicconnections make it more than likely that he would have known the significanceof the octagon as the Templars’ own symbol for the Temple of Solomon. He shouldalso have known that the location he proposed for this distinctive octagonalplaza encroached physically on the site of the Templars’ former Londonheadquarters. But if there is any doubt over his deliberation in these mattersit is settled for us by a final telling detail. Half a mile to the east Wrendeliberately altered the east-west axis of the ‘new’ St. Paul's Cathedral by afew degrees to the south so that it would now align with Temple Church.96[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1229]We've noted that Temple Church was conceived of initially as a scale model ofthe Church of the Holy Sepulchre and that the latter stood west of the originalsite of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. In Wren's London Temple Churchstands west of St. Paul's in the same way. Could it be, therefore, that what thearchitect had in mind with all this was a scheme for building a ‘hiddenJerusalem’ in the heart of London?THE GHOST IN THE PLANIt is reported by Christopher Wren's own son (also called Christopher) thatduring his inaugural speech as professor of astronomy at Gresham College, WrenSenior described London as:… a city particularly favoured by the celestial influences, a Pandora, on whicheach planet has contributed something …97[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1230]This, it must be remembered, was a time when astrology and scientific astronomyoverlapped seamlessly, and when many still believed in the influence of thestars and planets. But it is unlikely that Wren had in mind horoscopic astrologywhen referring to London. What is more likely is that he was thinking ofinfluences of a more spiritual and mystical nature, such as the talismanicinfluences found in Hermetic magic and in Renaissance Christian-Cabala. StevePadget, a professor of architecture at the University of Kansas, explains:Following the break with Papal authority, the ‘cosmos’ for the English no longercentred around Rome and St. Peter's, but London and the old Gothic St. Paul's.Its centre spire acted the role of axis mundi for this world, symbolising thecentre of London, England and the universe … When the spire was broken (felledin the Great Fire of 1666), it denoted a catastrophe of cosmic proportion. Thesymbolic connection between heaven/earth/underworld had been severed …98[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1231]Charles II and the Anglican clergy were eager to dispel the rumour started byCatholics that the Great Fire had been the act of a wrathful God to admonish theEnglish people for having broken away from the Church of Rome and the authorityof the pope. The trick that the king and his advisers pulled off was totransform the Fire into a symbol of purification and regeneration for London andthe realm, intended to bring to fruition a ‘perfect Christian society’. And oncethat had been achieved, comments Professor Paget, ‘the implication was thatfulfilment of the New Jerusalem was possible.’99[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1232] The king himself wrote a sermonin which, according to historian Vaughan Hart,… the Bishop of London proclaimed St. Paul's at the centre of a royalist NewJerusalem for ‘here hath the lord ordained … the throne of David for judgement;and the charge of Moyses for instruction,’ adding that ‘this Church is your Sonindeed, others are but synagogues, this is your Jerusalem, the mother to themall.’ Following the Cabalistic theme within this sermon, the influence of ChristianCabala … could be expected in … subsequent work of the restoration of the seatof David and Moses … The Christian Cabalist hoped that through such divinelyinspired intellectual magic, pre-Christian or otherwise, the conditions on earthfor nothing less than the Second Coming would be created, a necessary prelude tothe Apocalypse and final establishment of the Heavenly Jerusalem.100[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1233]We shall return to Wren's design of the new St. Paul's and its full implicationsin due course. Meanwhile the longer we looked at his plan for London, the morewe sensed something else was embedded in it, something ‘ghosted’, as it were,beneath the layout of the avenues and plazas. Standing back and viewing thedesign as a whole we realised that what the overarching vision reminded us of –albeit a little hazily – was the Sephirothic Tree of Life!101[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1234]Naturally our first thought was that our eyes were just being tricked by acommon optical illusion. And, indeed, a common optical illusion it might wellhave been were it not for the fact that two days after Wren had presented hisplan to Charles II, yet another ‘sephirothic’ scheme for the redesign of Londonwas proposed to the king by John Evelyn.EVELYN'S PLANOn 13 September 1666, Evelyn secured his own audience with Charles II in – ofall places – the queen's bedchamber in Whitehall.102[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1235]What immediately strikes the eye in Evelyn's plan, and must surely have struckthe king's eye as well, is how strangely similar it is to Wren's. Yet on theface of things Wren seems to have done everything he could to keep his worksecret.103 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1236] We know, for example,that he did not take the advice of his colleagues at the Royal Society – much tothe chagrin of Secretary Henry Oldenburg.104[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1237] When the latter complained aboutthe lapse Wren curtly replied that he had wanted to submit his design first,before anyone else had the chance to distract the king's attention and thus‘could not possibly consult the Society about it.’105[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1238]For his part Evelyn simply wrote in his diary: ‘Dr. Wren had got a start onme.’106 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1239] However historian AdrianTinniswood is satisfied that there was much closer collusion between the two menthan such remarks suggest:Striking similarities between the two schemes show that they [Wren and Evelyn]must have discussed their dream of an ideal London either before the firebrought those dreams a dramatic step closer to realization, or when they wereboth working on them in the second week of September. They both proposed thatthe area between Temple Bar and the Fleet should be given over to a piazza whichwould form the intersection of eight streets radiating out on the points of thecompass. They both enclosed the buildings which fronted onto this piazza with anoctagon of connecting streets. They both made the entrance to the northern endof London Bridge a focal point of their plan, and created a semicircular piazzaas a grand introduction to it. They both sent main thoroughfares in from theeast to converge at St. Paul's…Apassing reference in the explanatory discoursethat Evelyn submitted along with his plan confirms some sort of collaboration,and suggests that he adopted some of Wren's ideas. He implied that the two mendiscussed their respective schemes on or immediately before 11 September, andsays that the ‘street from St. Paul's maybe divaricated like a Pythagorian, asthe most accurately ingenious Dr. Wren had designed it, and I willingly followin my second thoughts.’ …107 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1240]It cannot be a coincidence that the plans of Evelyn and Wren both incorporatethe same meaningful Templar symbol of the octagon in exactly the same meaningfulplace: i.e. overlapping the old London headquarters of the Knights Templar closeto Temple Church. We note also that on Evelyn's plan the octagonal plaza isplaced directly west of St. Paul's Cathedral in such a way that its centrealigns with the axis of the cathedral – the two points being joined together bythe wide avenue of Fleet Street.Most intriguing of all, is the clear, purposeful definition with which Evelyn'splan is so obviously structured around the Sephirothic Tree of Life. If there issome ambiguity in Wren's case, Evelyn's plan certainly leaves no doubt as to hismotive. For despite some minimal variations required for practicality, thesimilarity between Evelyn's geometrical pattern and that of the Sephirothic Treeof Life is unmistakable.Presumably by firing their ‘double salvo’ on 11 and 13 September Wren and Evelynmust have hoped that the Sephirothic Tree of Life, as well as the other sharedelements concealed in both their plans, would quickly be approved by the king.We suspect also that in the minds of both men must have been the well-knownfinal verses from the book of Revelation which evoke the creation of the ‘NewJerusalem’ and the ‘Tree of Life’:Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the firstearth had vanished…I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heavenfrom God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband … It had a great highwall, with twelve gates, at which were twelve angels, and on the gates wereinscribed the names of the twelve tribes of Israel … the city had twelvefoundation-stones, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles … Then Iwas shown the river of the water of life, sparkling like crystal, flowing … downthe middle of the city's streets. On either side of the river stood a Tree ofLife, which yields twelve crops of fruits … Happy are those who wash their robesclean! They will have the right to the Tree of Life and will enter by the gatesof the city …108 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1241]It is quite obvious from this scheme of things in the book of Revelation thatthe design of the ‘New Jerusalem’ was to incorporate the number ‘12’ and, moreimportantly, that the holy city should rest upon a matrix of 12‘foundation-stones’ or foci. Interesting then, as historians Felix Barker andRalph Hyde point out, that:Evelyn wanted twelve interconnecting squares and piazzas … [and] a straighteast-to-west thoroughfare [that would] cut its way for a mile and a half from‘King Charles Gate’ [in the London wall, south of Aldgate] to Temple Bar wherethere was a piazza with eight radiating roads like Wren's.109[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1242]Interesting, too, that if we superimpose Evelyn's obviously ‘sephirothic’ planon the actual geometry of a Sephrothic Tree of Life, it can be seen that St.Paul's Cathedral corresponds to the one sephirah, the divine emanation known asTipheret, which means ‘Beauty’. Astrologically this sephirah represents the Sun,the centre of the universe, from which emanates all life and light. The analogyis obvious: St. Paul's was to be the spiritual centre of the regenerated city asit rose from the ashes like a solar phoenix to guide the restored Stuartmonarchy on the true path of the reformed Christianity.Corresponding to the large ‘Templar’ octagon in Evelyn's plan is the sephirahknown as Yesod, which means ‘Foundation’. Could this mean that the new worldorder which was to emerge from the ‘New Jerusalem’ had its foundations in theOrder of the Temple or, more precisely, the new Masonic order which had emergedfrom Templar ideologies and to which the Stuart monarch had given his royalprotection?Another curious feature of Evelyn's plan is that he moved the Royal Exchangeaway from the centre of the city (whereas Wren had kept it there on the originalsite of Thomas Gresham's building).110[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1243] Evelyn placed it nearer to theriver, further upstream from London Bridge – most likely because he wanted tohave at the heart of his planned ‘New Jerusalem’ another more relevant symbolwhich would correspond to the appropriate sephirah in the Tree of Life. Thiscame in the form of the fountain he envisaged for the marketplace on GracechurchStreet, which may represent the so-called 11th hidden sephirah, known as Daat,from which emanates the fountain of knowledge that irrigates the whole.111[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1244]SOLOMON'S TEMPLE VEILED IN SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL?In addition to serving as the spiritual centre and solar symbol of theregenerated London, logic suggests that Saint Paul's Cathedral also came tosymbolise Solomon's Temple in the New Jerusalem that Wren and Evelyn had inmind. Christopher Wren was subsequently made surveyor of St. Paul's Cathedral in1668 and surveyor general for the King's Works a year later. In this capacity heproduced a design for the rebuilding of St. Paul's which, finally, in 1671 hepresented to Charles II. Here is Tinniswood's assessment of the design:The building was quite unlike anything seen in Britain before. A round centralspace more than 120 feet in diameter had four stubby arms of equal lengthprojected out to north, south, east and west. The sloping sides of the octagonthus formed were concave, so that in plan the cathedral looked like a Greekcross. And inevitably, the central space was crowned with a monumental domesupported on a ring of eight pillars …112[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1245]It is true that Wren's octagonal floor-plan for St. Paul's was something totally‘unseen in Britain before.’113 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1246]But it most certainly had been seen by those who had visited the Holy Land andJerusalem and studied the Dome of the Rock which the Knights Templar had muchearlier adopted as their symbol for Solomon's Temple. Viewed in profile, Wren'sdesign for the new St. Paul's does in fact bear an uncanny resemblance to theDome of the Rock: both have the same octagonal floor-plan; both have the samerotunda or rounded central space; both have the massive cupola supported byeight pillars; both have been deliberately aligned to the four cardinaldirections: north, south, east and west. Last but not least, from both theeight-sided Templar Cross can easily be derived.What Masonic game was Wren playing in his plans for London and for Saint Paul'sCathedral? And why did it involve the symbols of an ancient heresy?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENFROM SECRET SOCIETY TO SOCIETY WITH SECRETSIn February 1685 Charles II died peacefully at Whitehall, having made a deathbedconversion to Catholicism that left the nation somewhat confused. Since therewere no legitimate sons the succession went to his autocratic brother, James,Duke of York, a devout and zealous Catholic. In 1673 James had married Mary ofModena, also a staunch Catholic. And not surprisingly, as soon as he was safelycrowned he placed Catholics in important positions within the government. Thisraised fears, even amongst his Anglican supporters, that he was on the verge ofreimposing Roman Catholicism as the state religion in Britain. The situationreached a crisis in 1689 when, on 22 February, James II was forced to abdicatein favour of William of Orange and his wife Mary, the heiress presumptive, whowere both staunch Protestants.This marked the end for the Stuarts as a ruling dynasty, but not yet for JamesII and his ‘Jacobite’ supporters (the latter being a name derived from the Latinversion of ‘James’ i.e. Jacobus). As Charles II had done before him, James wentinto exile in France at the court of Louis XIV. He took along with him his wholefamily and a large band of Jacobites, and they all settled in the Château deSaint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris. It was there, according to some Masonicresearchers, that the first official Masonic lodges on French soil began toemerge.When James II died in 1701, his 13-year-old son, Prince James Francis Edward,was immediately recognised by Louis XIV as James III, the British king-in-exile.In 1713, however, Louis made peace with Britain, and the ‘Old Pretender’, asJames III was now being called, left for Rome along with his family and hisJacobite court. In 1714 his half-sister, Queen Ann, died leaving no survivingchildren. But because of an act of Parliament that precluded James from thesuccession on account of his Catholic faith, the British throne went to theProtestant elector of Hanover, who became King George I.Within the small group of Jacobites in Rome making up the increasingly decrepitStuart court-in-exile was a well-educated Scotsman called Andrew Michael Ramsaywho served as private tutor of the children of the Old Pretender. Ramsay, who isbetter known to Freemasons as the ‘Chevalier Ramsay’, was soon to play a pivotalrole in the evolution of Freemasonry.Meanwhile in Britain the official ‘coming out’ of the Craft took place when theso-called Grand Lodge of England was created in London on 24 June 1717 – St.John's Day, the attested feast and ‘new year’ of the Freemasons.1[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1247] In the New Testament, St. Johnthe Baptist is depicted as the forerunner of Christ the Messiah, and in EasternChristian tradition he is regarded as the most important saint after the VirginMary. Indeed, in the Gospel of Matthew Jesus himself is made to praise SaintJohn as follows:Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has risen no one greaterthan John the Baptist.2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1248]A prophet in his own right John the Baptist supposedly stepped aside to preparethe way for the Christ-Messiah by saying: ‘He must increase, but I mustdecrease.’3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1249] In this apparentlycryptic remark there is obvious solar symbolism which accomplished Freemasonswill surely understand – for by 24 June the Sun's altitude in heaven does indeeddecrease after passing the apogee of the summer solstice.The celebration of St. John's Day traditionally began on the night of St. John'sEve i.e. 23 June, and was at one time called ‘Bonfire Night’ in parts of Europeand Ireland. But there was an inherent error in the Julian calendar relative tothe true solar year (and thus also relative to the new, more accurate, Gregoriancalendar). Accumulating year by year, the effect of this error was that ‘23 JuneJulian’ was forever slipping further away from the summer solstice – such thatit fell some 13 days after the solstice by 1717. At that time, Britain and itsAmerican colonies had not yet adopted the new Gregorian calendar (which theyregarded as a Catholic, and thus tainted, innovation). The official calendar inBritain was therefore still the Julian calendar, which was 11 days ahead of thenew Gregorian calendar.St. John's Eve, 23 June 1717 on the Julian calendar corresponds with 4 July inthe Gregorian calendar. Let us keep this curious conversion in mind since 4 Julyis clearly a date which would soon have a great symbolic resonance in theAmerican colonies and in France.4 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1250]RECRUITING FROM THE RULING CLASSESOn 24 June 1717 the formation of the Grand Lodge of England was achieved by theamalgamation of four older lodges in London. From this date onwards Freemasonrywas no longer a secret society but began to operate very much out in the open,and in a manner that would certainly have attracted heresy charges in earlier,less enlightened, centuries.A certain Mr. Anthony Sayer was appointed the first Grand Master of the newunited body.5 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1251] Very little isknown of Sayer. He remained at his post for only a year and was succeeded byGeorge Payne in 1718, then by the celebrated Dr. John Theophilus Desaguliers in1719.6 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1252] Of French birth,Desaguliers had been brought to England as an infant by his Huguenot parents whohad fled from La Rochelle during the persecution of Protestants by Louis XIV. Hegrew up to become a brilliant scholar, and studied law at Oxford. In 1714Desaguliers was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and eventually became itscurator. There he befriended several famous scientists, including the greatIsaac Newton. It was Desaguliers who was responsible for attracting intoFreemasonry many men from the nobility, amongst them the Duke of Lorraine, thefuture Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, and Frederick Prince of Wales, the son ofGeorge II, to whom Desaguliers was appointed tutor.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1253] It is thus that from 1721, andmuch thanks to Desaguliers, the Grand Lodge of England has always been headed bya member of the royal family.8 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1254]Such illustrious sponsorship and royal approval, as well as its policy ofreligious tolerance and freedom of thought and, paradoxically, its stringentoath of secrecy, made Freemasonry an exceedingly popular fellowship amongst thearistocracy and the educated middle classes. Masonic lodges began to flourisheverywhere in Europe, and the first Parisian lodge of English origin, which wentunder the name of St. Thomas, was opened in 1726 by Charles Radclyffe, whobelonged to an old Scottish family loyal to the Stuarts. It seems that CharlesRadclyffe himself was the son of a natural but illegitimate daughter of CharlesII.9 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1255] Radclyffe unwisely attemptedto return to England in 1746 where he was arrested as a Jacobite spy andexecuted.Another illegitimate descendant of Charles II, who presided in the French lodge,La Loge d’Aubigny, was the Duke of Richmond, grandson of the Duchess ofPortsmouth, Louise de Kérouaille, a favourite mistress of Charles II.10[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1256] The Duke of Richmond had also putin a spell as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England in 1724.The Jacobite community in Paris at the time also included the Duke of Wharton,who had likewise been Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England – in his casein 1722. The Duke of Wharton, who was expelled from the Grand Lodge in 1723after a serious scandal, fled to Europe where he eventually settled in Paris tobecome the first Grand Master of French Freemasonry in 1728, later to be calledthe Grande Loge de France.11 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1257] Itwas about this time that the Scotsman, Ramsay, who was also now in Paris, beganto nurture radical ideas about how Freemasonry might be developed in France andin other lands.THE KNIGHT RAMSAYFreemasonry's famous ‘Scottish Rite’ is often said to have originated in Francein 1725, that is eight years after the formation of the Grand Lodge of Englandin 1717. The well-known Masonic historian Jasper Ridley has this to say:During the eighteenth century other Masonic rites developed in various parts ofthe world, of which the most important was the so-called Scottish Rite. It hadnever, in fact, existed in Scotland, but had originated in France, and wascalled the Rite Écossais – the Scottish Rite – because the Scotsman, theChevalier Ramsay, was thought to have started it …12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1258]Other researchers think there's more to the story. It does seem almost certainthat Andrew Michael Ramsay, better known as the Chevalier Ramsay, and indeed aScotsman, was responsible for the formation of what became known as the ScottishRite throughout the world. But there is much to suggest the that this rite wasan amalgamation of older ideas that had circulated among earlier Scottish lodgesin Scotland itself and that Ramsay had simply synthesised and brought toFrance.13 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1259]Andrew Michael Ramsay was born in 1686 in Ayr, a town about 40 miles southwestof Glasgow in Scotland, and not far from Kilwinning, ‘the traditional birthplaceof Scottish Freemasonry.’14 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1260]Although the son of a lowly baker, Ramsay was to become a refined man ofletters. Educated at the University of Edinburgh, he eventually received adegree in law from Oxford. After serving as an officer with the Duke ofMarlborough in Flanders in 1706, Ramsay decided to remain in the Netherlands.There he met a Frenchman, Pierre Poiret, a disciple of Madame Guyon, a popularFrench Catholic mystic who was closely associated with the great French scholarand author, François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon, the bishop of Cambrai.Fénelon was famous throughout Europe, and was particularly well known for havingwritten Les Aventures de Télémaque, a very popular book at the time, in which hepresented to the French court an allegory, set in historical locations such asancient Egypt and Phoenicia, of the ideal utopian state.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1261]For a long time Fénelon had entertained excellent connections at the Frenchcourt in Paris when he was tutor to the heir apparent and grandson of Louis XIV,the Duke of Burgundy. Indeed, Fénelon originally wrote the Adventures ofTélémaque while he was at court – apparently for the benefit of the youngprince, who he hoped would one day become king of France and put into practicethe perfect state and the ideal government modelled on the golden age of theancient world.16 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1262] But Fénelon'sunorthodox relationship with the Catholic mystic Madame Guyon eventually losthim the support of Louis XIV, who had him exiled to his diocese at Cambrai in1709.Now it seems that Ramsay may have acted as some sort of secretary for MadameGuyon, which might in turn explain why in 1710 he suddenly received aninvitation to visit Fénelon at Cambrai.17[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1263] There Ramsay and Fénelondeveloped a warm friendship which lasted until Fénelon's death in 1715. Soinfluenced was Ramsay by Fénelon that he converted to Catholicism at hisrequest.In 1716, a year after Fénelon's death, Ramsay settled in Paris, where hecirculated amongst the high aristocracy and became tutor to the young Duke ofChâteau-Theirry. At the same time Ramsay befriended the powerful Philipped’Orléans, nephew of Louis XIV and regent of France. The latter was the head ofthe Order of St. Lazarus, an old crusading order, akin to the Knights Templar,that had been founded in Jerusalem in the 12th century. Soon Ramsay was dubbed aknight of the Order of St. Lazarus by Philippe.We know that Ramsay was initiated into Freemasonry by the Duke of Richmond atthe Horn Lodge at Westminster18 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1264]during a visit that he made to London in 1730. On his return to Paris, Ramsayjoined Charles Radclyffe's Masonic lodge St. Thomas, and soon was appointed asOrator for the Grande Loge of France. It was in this capacity that he prepared alandmark speech in 1737, one that would have reverberations throughout the worldin decades to come.AN ANCIENT ORDER AND A DANGEROUS WHIFF OF REPUBLICANISMLegend has it that Ramsay's speech, which is better known as Ramsay's Oration,was delivered on 21 March 1737 so that it would coincide with the springequinox. There may be a reason for this date, as we shall see. However theevidence suggests that the Oration was not ‘delivered’ to an audience at all;instead, Ramsay had it printed and distributed to the lodge's members. By 1740it was published in Paris, where it was widely and avidly read.19[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1265]Knowing that Ramsay was both a member of the Royal Society and a Freemason helpsto put his Oration into context – for this remarkable document is resonant of‘republicanism’ and of an ideal of global unity based on a new world order. Ofparticular note is the fact that the Oration was put before the general publicas early as 1740 – a full 36 years before the outbreak of the American War ofIndependence in 1776 and 49 years before the outbreak of the French Revolutionin 1789. We suspect that Ramsay's carefully-chosen words must have struck aworrying note with the French monarchy and royalists in general:The world is nothing more than a huge Republic, of which every nation is afamily and every individual a child. Our society [i.e. Freemasonry] was at theoutset established to revive and spread these essential maxims borrowed from thenature of man. We desire to reunite all men of enlightened minds, gentle mannersand agreeable wit, not only by a love for the fine arts but much more by thegrand principle of virtue, science, and religion, where the interests of theFraternity [Freemasonry] shall become those of the whole human race, whence allnations shall be enabled to draw useful knowledge … Our ancestors, theCrusaders, gathered together from all parts of Christendom in the Holy Land,desired thus to reunite into one sole Fraternity the individuals of all nations…20 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1266]The last sentence gives an interesting and novel spin on the Crusades, or ratheron those ‘crusaders’ who, we're told, desired ‘to reunite into one soleFraternity the individuals of all nations …’ Since it is safe to say that ‘auniversal brotherhood of nations’ was not uppermost in the minds of the vastmajority of crusaders – who believed their job was to win the Holy Land forChristendom and to steal as much booty as possible – it is legitimate to askwhich ‘crusaders’ Ramsay is talking about here?We can only think of one group who might have been motivated by such an ideologyand they are, almost inevitably, the Knights Templar – who are, moreover,frequently cited by Freemasons as their ‘ancestors’. That it was indeed theTemplars who Ramsay had in mind (though he did not wish to name them) is alsomade clear by several indirect allusions in the Oration:Because a sad, savage, and misanthropic Philosophy disgusts virtuous men, ourancestors, the Crusaders, wished to render it lovable by the attractions ofinnocent pleasures, agreeable music, pure joy, and moderate gaiety. Ourfestivals are not what the profane world and the ignorant vulgar imagine. Allthe vices of heart and soul are banished there, and irreligion, libertinage,incredulity, and debauch are proscribed.21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1267]It was well known throughout Europe that the Templars had been dissolved bypapal decree and French military force after accusations of vice, debauchery andheresy. Here Ramsay is obviously defending the Templars and their alleged‘descendants’, the Freemasons, against such accusations by claiming that whatappeared as debauchery and heresy to the ‘profane’ was in reality nothing morethat the display of innocent pleasures and moderate merry-making.Ramsay also tells us that the order once enjoyed special royal protection inEngland:After the deplorable mishaps in the Crusades, the perishing of the Christianarmies, and the triumph of Bendocdar, Sultan of Egypt, during the eighth andlast Crusade, that great Prince Edward, son of Henry III, King of England,seeing there was no longer any safety for his brethren in the Holy Land, fromwhence the Christian troops were retiring, brought them all back, and thiscolony of brothers was established in England. As this Prince was endowed withall heroic qualities, he loved the fine arts, declared himself Protector of ourOrder, conceded to it new privileges, and then the members of this Fraternitytook the name of Freemasons, after the example set by their ancestors.22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1268]The ‘great Prince Edward, son of Henry III’ evoked by Ramsay as the ‘Protectorof our Order’ was the celebrated Edward I – famously nicknamed ‘Longshanks’ onaccount of his unusually tall stature. King of England from 1274, Edward I isbest known for his war of oppression against the Scots first under WilliamWallace and later under Robert the Bruce – the latter long suspected to havebeen a patron of the Templars in the years after their persecution. But Ramsay'sclear implication here is that Edward was also their patron. Presumably,therefore, he would have remained so until his death on 7 July 1307, threemonths before the mass arrests of Templars in France which, the reader willrecall, took place on 13 October 1307.In the years that followed it is notable that Edward I’s son, Edward II,continued to favour the Knights Templar despite increasing pressure from thepope and King Philip IV of France as late as 1312, when Philip convinced thepope to issue his infamous Vox in excelso papal bull of 22 March (the springequinox) officially suppressing the Templars. It seems that Edward II’scompliance was only half-hearted. He made a few token arrests while allowingmost of the knights simply to melt into other chivalrous orders, such as that ofthe Knights Hospitallier.Bearing this in mind, let's recall the legendary ‘official date’ of Ramsay'sOration – i.e. 21 March 1737, the spring equinox. Surely this must be adeliberate allusion to the papal bull that had suppressed the Templars on thespring equinox? Masonic historian Alexander Piatigorsky, who has made a specialstudy of the Oration, notes how Chevalier Ramsay subtly managed to pack it withquite a number of controversial claims:The first places the origin of Masonic rituals ‘at the time of the Crusades’ andassociates them with … the Knights Templar and the esoteric traditions of othermedieval Christian Orders. The second asserts that after the suppression of theTemplars in the beginning of the fourteenth century and the decline of the otherOrders, their esoteric traditions were originally grafted onto, or found shelteramong, some Scottish Masonic Lodges e.g. the Mother Lodge of Kilwinning. And thethird maintains that those Scottish Traditions (or Orders), which are Christianby definition … were still continuing in Scottish Masonry, and that he [i.e.Ramsay] himself represented them in France as well as in England.23[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1269]It is interesting that Ramsay also goes on to state in his Oration that ‘thefamous festivals of Ceres at Eleusis, of Isis in Egypt, of Minerva at Athens, ofUrania among the Phoenicians, and Diana in Scythia, were connected to ours [i.e.to the rites and festivals of Freemasonry].’ He pauses to recognise that somefellow Freemasons attribute great antiquity to the brotherhood by ascribing ‘ourinstitution to Solomon, some to Moses, some to Abraham, some to Noah and some toEnoch who built the first city, or even to Adam.’ But ‘without making anypretences of denying these origins’ Ramsay chooses to pass on ‘to matters lessancient’:This, then, is a part of what I have gathered in the annals of Great Britain, inthe Acts of Parliament, which speak often of our privileges, and in the livingtradition of the English people, which has been the centre of our Society[Freemasonry] since the 11th century. At the time of the Crusades in Palestine many princes, lords and citizensassociated themselves to restore the Temple of the Christians in the Holy Land …and to employ themselves in bringing back their architecture … Our Order [whichwas amongst them] must … be considered … as an Order founded in remoteantiquity, and renewed in the Holy Land by our ancestors in order to recall thememory of the most sublime truths … [After the Crusades were over] the kings, princes and lords returned fromPalestine to their own lands, and there established diverse Lodges. At the timemany Lodges were already erected in Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and fromthence in Scotland, because of the close alliance between the French and Scots.James Lord Steward was Grand Master of a Lodge established at Kilwinning, in thewest of Scotland … This lord received as Freemasons into his Lodge the Earls ofGloucester and Ulster, the one English the other Irish. By degrees our lodges and our rites were neglected in most places. This is whyof so many historians only those of Great Britain speak of our Order.Nevertheless it preserved its splendour among those Scotsmen [the Scots Guards]to whom the kings of France confided during many centuries the safeguard oftheir royal persons.24 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1270]Whatever Ramsay's motives, and regardless of the vexed issue of the veracity ofthe Oration, most Freemasons agree that it was soon after its publication thatthe so-called additional or higher degrees of Freemasonry first began to appear.Ramsay may not have been involved directly in formulating any of these degreesbut there can be little doubt that his ideas about the past – and future – ofFreemasonry played an important role in bringing them into existence. Thesedegrees are still very much part of the Masonic world today. They represent aset of goals towards which most Freemasons aspire, which may be attained by theright candidates through ever higher levels of initiation. Before returning tothe story of Freemasonry in the years leading up to the French Revolution itwill be useful to make a short excursion into these airy realms.EXCURSION TO THE HIGHER DEGREES (1) SCHISMSWhen the Grand Lodge of England was founded in 1717, not all Freemasons wantedto accept its authority as a centralised Masonic body.Even within Britain a powerful opposing faction eventually emerged whichconsidered itself the ‘true repository’ of ancient Freemasonry. Those adheringto it called themselves the Antients and labelled all who joined the Grand Lodgeof England disparagingly as Moderns. After nearly half a century of feudingbetween the Antients and the Moderns, both factions were finally ‘united’ inBritain under the banner of the ‘United’ Grand Lodge of England – a sort ofMasonic mini-version of the ‘United States’. This happened in 1813 when 21articles of union were signed by both groups, the most important declaring andpronouncing that:… pure Antient Masonry consists of three degrees and no more i.e. those of theEntered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft and the Master Mason, including the SupremeOrder of the Holy Royal Arch. But this article is not intended to prevent anyLodge or Chapter from holding a Meeting in any of the Degrees of the Orders ofChivalry, according to the constitutions of the said Orders.25[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1271]What this means in practice, as we shall see, is that ‘higher’ or ‘additional’degrees are available to Freemasons in English lodges exclusively through theSupreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch. However, in the world as a whole, thereare other Masonic orders which also offer ‘higher’ or ‘additional’ degrees. Twothat are particularly popular in the US are the so-called York Rite, and theAncient And Accepted Scottish Rite, descended from Andrew Ramsay's originalScottish Rite. The York Rite offers three extra degrees, namely the Royal ArchMasons degree, the Royal and Select Masters degree and the Knights Templardegree. The Ancient And Accepted Scottish Rite, by far the largest and mostimportant, offers a total of 33 degrees and is considered by many as the mostinfluential and supremely elitist of all the Masonic orders.It is these rites that offer the ‘degrees of the Orders of Chivalry’ mentionedabove. An important factor contributing to their formation and rapidproliferation was again the desire on the part of Freemasons not to be under thejurisdiction of United Grand Lodge of England – in this case often because theylived in countries that were in conflict with Britain. Since France remainedBritain's traditional foe well into the 19th century, French Freemasons weredetermined to have a separate identity. While developing a completelyindependent type of Freemasonry of their own they also began to nourish closeties with Freemasons in the colonies during the build-up to the AmericanRevolution.This is why we find many of the higher ‘degrees of the Orders of Chivalry’ stillenjoying active support in the US today. Moreover even the most cursoryexamination of the Scottish Rite and the York Rite leaves little doubt that thedegrees they offer are heavily laced with Templar associations.In the York Rite, which some Masons in the US call the ‘American Rite’, thesymbolism, iconography and regalia used are all unambiguously ‘Templar’, andTemplar symbols and links are openly flaunted. As noted above, the third‘additional’ degree of the York Rite is called the Knights Templar degree.As for the Scottish Rite, the chivalrous element of the Knights Templar isclearly seen in the names given to the various degrees offered – such as Knightof the East, Knight of Jerusalem, Knight of Rose Croix, Knight Commander of theTemple, Knight Kadosh, and so forth. In the US, the Scottish Rite also sponsorsthe very popular para-Masonic fraternity for young men, generally for sons ofFreemasons, known as the ‘International Order of DeMolay’, so named in memory ofJacques de Molay, last of the true Grand Masters of the Knights Templar.26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1272]EXCURSION TO HIGHER DEGREES (2) HOLY ROYAL ARCHRegular or Craft Freemasonry, meaning that type of Freemasonry which isregulated by the united grand lodges and their various warrants around theworld, offers three levels of initiation to the new recruits. These are oftenreferred to as ‘symbolic’ or ‘blue’ degrees and are, respectively, EnteredApprentice, Fellow Craft and Master Mason.Most Freemasons complete their Masonic education when they obtain the MasterMason degree. There are, however, a few others who want to take their initiationfurther and thus proceed to what are generally referred to as the ‘additionaldegrees’ or ‘higher degrees’. These can be considered as emanating from CraftFreemasonry and can only be entered by those who have completed the third ‘blue’degree of Master Mason. In Britain the only additional degree that is regulatedby United Grand Lodge is the so-called Royal Arch. This is how the United GrandLodge introduces the Royal Arch:Under the English Constitution, basic Freemasonry is divided into two parts,called the Craft and the Royal Arch. For Freemasons who really want to explorethe subject in more depth there is a host of other ceremonies, which, forhistorical reasons, are not administered by the United Grand Lodge of England.All English Freemasons experience the three Craft (or basic) ceremonies unlessthey drop out from Freemasonry very early on. These three ceremonies (or degreesas we call them) look at the relations between people, man's natural equalityand his dependence on others, the importance of education and the rewards oflabour, fidelity to a promise, contemplation of inevitable death, and one's dutyto others. A fourth ceremony – the Royal Arch emphasises man's dependence onGod.27 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1273]The United Grand Lodge of England has its headquarters at Freemasons’ Hall inLondon. This huge neo-classical edifice is located at the crossroads of GreatQueen Street and Drury Lane. But few initiation ceremonies are conducted there,with most of the three degrees being ‘worked’ in the 8,000 or so ‘lodges’ or‘temples’ across the country. As one recent Grand Master pointed out, there isan even wider ‘spread from English origins throughout the world’ if we considerall the so-called overseas warrants.Any Master Freemason, i.e. third degree Mason, can further his Masonic career bytaking one or more or all of the ‘additional’ or ‘higher’ degrees. In England,this usually entails taking the supplementary degrees recognized by the UnitedGrand Lodge, meaning those administered by the Holy Royal Arch under thejurisdiction of the Supreme Grand Holy Royal Arch Chapter of Jerusaleminstituted in 1766. Higher Royal Arch degrees are ‘worked’ not in lodges but inchapter lodges. There are some 3,000 or so chapter lodges in Britain alone, withan estimated combined membership of 150,000.EXCURSION TO HIGHER DEGREES (3) WARRIOR-MASONS OF ZERUBBABELIn Craft Freemasonry the themes of the rituals revolve around pseudo-biblicalevents concerning the construction of Solomon's Temple. More specifically, thethird or Master Mason degree deals with the death and raising of one HiramAbiff, a pseudo-biblical character probably modelled on the legendary Phoenicianarchitect, Hiram of Tyre, who supposedly designed or participated in theconstruction of Solomon's Temple around 950 BC.28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1274] In this ritual, the apotheosis isreached when the Master Masonelect is ‘raised’ from a symbolic death supposedlymimicking the death and ‘raising’ of Hiram Abiff who was himself brutallymurdered by three ‘Fellows’ for refusing to impart to them the ‘secret’ of theMaster Mason's ‘word’. Presumably one of the messages of all this is that aMaster Mason chooses death rather than to break his Masonic oath – an act ofultimate loyalty which is rewarded by him being ‘raised’ as a resurrected newMaster.In the Holy Royal Arch rituals, however, the so-called Hiramic theme is replacedby a different focus, now concerning the reconstruction of Solomon's Temple byZerubbabel and his followers. In the Bible Zerubbabel was the leader of the Jewsexiled in Babylon who negotiated their freedom from their Babylonian oppressorsand heroically led them all back to Palestine. Zerubbabel became governor ofJerusalem and ordered the reconstruction of the Temple which had been destroyedby the Babylonians. Interestingly some researchers believe that the particularobsession of the Knights Templar with Solomon's Temple might likewise have beenfocused, in a mystical sense, on its rebuilding rather than anything else:The Templars saw themselves as the Warrior-Masons of Zerubbabel, who persuadedKing Darius to allow the rebuilding of the Temple of Jerusalem. They inheritedthe belief from the Gnostics and St. John that the Temple was the mystic centreof the world, and so they secretly resisted the power and authority of the Popesand Kings of Europe. The black and white devices of their order … showed theirGnosticism and Manicheism, the belief in the continuing struggle of the devil'sworld against God's Intelligence. They bequeathed to the Masons theblack-and-white lozenges and Indented Tassels of their Lodges.29[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1275]The alleged dualistic or ‘Manichean’ symbolism of the ‘black and white devices’used by the Templars (which were numerous and included their checkered battleflag, the beauséant) are not matters that we need concern ourselves with here.What interests us more is this further hint of the continuity of interests,symbolism and ritual that seems to tie the Freemasons, who are still very much aforce to be reckoned with in the world, to the Knights Templar who havesupposedly been extinct for 700 years.To return to the Royal Arch rituals of Freemasonry, there are usually three main‘actors’ who assume the role of Zerubbabel and his two trusted colleagues,Joshua and Haggia. These protagonists re-enact the clearing of the site whereonce stood the ‘Temple of Solomon’ and while doing so discover a golden plateupon which are written the ‘sacred and mysterious’ names of God. These turn outto be the well-known name of Jehovah, correctly written as Jahveh (from theLatin consonants JHVH which are all that the Old Testament gives us) and alsoanother, more mysterious name proclaimed to be Jahbulon.30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1276] The name Jahveh is split intothree syllables, Ja-h-veh, and written inside a small circle. The same is donefor Jahbulon, Jah-bul-on, but in this case inscribed on the corners of atriangle drawn inside the circle.Thus combined, these obvious Pythagorean symbols also form the common alchemicaldevice used to show the so-called mystical relationship of the square, thecircle and the triangle. Masonic author and researcher Martin Short refers to a‘mystical lecture’ that is sometimes given in Holy Royal Arch rituals in whichit is explained that:… In times of antiquity, names of God and symbols of divinity were alwaysenclosed in triangular figures … In the days of Pythagoras the triangle wasconsidered the most sacred of emblems … The Egyptians termed it the SacredNumber, and so highly was it prized by the ancients, that it became amongst theman object of worship. They gave it the sacred name of God … This sacred Delta isusually enclosed with a square and circle … the word on the triangle is thatSacred and mysterious Name you have just solemnly engaged yourself never topronounce.31 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1277]EXCURSION TO HIGHER DEGREES (4) MUCH FUSS ABOUT JAHBULONCraft Freemasonry uses epithets for God such as the ‘Grand Architect of theUniverse’, the ‘Great Geometrician’ or the ‘Supreme Being’. But in the RoyalArch the adepts find it necessary actually to give God a name such as Jahbulon.We cannot be certain how long this name was used before it began to attracthostile attention in the early 1980s. In 1985, however, the Church of Englandand the Methodist Church urged Freemasonry to remove it from Royal Arch ritualson the grounds that they suspected it to be of pagan origins.32[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1278] Many anti-Masonic researcherswithin the clerical establishments were convinced that the name Jahbulon veiledthree ancient deities, namely the Hebrew Jahveh or Yahweh, the Phoenician Baalor Buul, and the patron deity of the ancient Egyptian city of On (Anu, orHeliopolis, the ‘City of the Sun’) who some took to be Ra, and some Osiris.33[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1279]The clerics protested that this sort of pagan syncretism was something ‘whichChristianity cannot accept’ and that quite simply Jahbulon, whoever or whateverhe was, had to go. The Freemasons retaliated by arguing that Jahbulon was not aname of God at all but merely a ‘description of God’. The clerics, however, wereunimpressed and fought a relentless battle over the matter in the media –causing much nervousness in Masonic circles inhabited by people who are normallyaccustomed to secrecy. In July 1989 the United Grand Lodge caved in under thepressure and announced that Jahbulon would henceforth be replaced by Jahvehalone, a name for God generally regarded as acceptable by Christians. Thisseemed to do the trick and the media lost interest in the story.Not many clerics were convinced at this quick ‘conversion’ of the Masons.Jahveh, after all, was confirmed to have been associated with the first syllableof the name Jahbulon, and it seemed to some that the whole bizarre exercisemerely amounted to more or less the same thing as replacing a name by itsdiminutive – such as ‘Kat’ for ‘Katherine’ and so forth.Could there possibly be some fire behind all this smoke about Masonic‘paganism’?EXCURSION TO HIGHER DEGREES (5) ANCIENT EGYPT AND GEOMETRYA 1901 aquarelle illustration made by artist R. F. Sherar of the originalinterior of the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Scotland, designed by thearchitect Peter Henderson and located in Edinburgh, makes it immediately clearthat this particular grand chapter at least was modeled on an ancient Egyptianpharaonic temple.34 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1280] A closerexamination of the various illustrations on the walls uncovers scenes taken fromthe ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead depicting the god Osiris on his heavenlythrone like some monarch of the Solomonic age passing divine judgment on theneophyte brought before him. There is also a very similar pseudo-Egyptian templeat the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, on the floor of which can beseen the winged-uraeus or solar-serpent, the supreme symbol of ancient Egypt.Many other Royal Arch chapters around the world are likewise designed or partlydesigned as ‘Egyptian’ temples, such as Freemasons’ Hall in Dublin which, inMartin Short's, words boasts two sphinxes and other sculptures ‘aping ancientEgypt.’35 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1281] Short similarly drawsattention to the modern Holy Royal Arch temple at Petersham, New South Wales inAustralia which has an Egyptian room with murals showing scenes from theEgyptian Book of the Dead including images of Osiris.36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1282]A colleague of Martin Short, the notorious anti-Masonic author Stephen Knight,had been one of the first – as early as 1981 – to take the Masonic name Jahbulonto task. In the refrain that the clergy would later echo he claimed that it wasan allegory of pagan deities including the Egyptian god Osiris, the ‘Lord ofOn’.37 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1283] In 1987 Short reiteratedKnight's view that the syllable On in Jahbulon denoted the ancient Egyptian holycity of On, i.e. Heliopolis or the ‘City of the Sun’ where had once stood thegreat sun-Temple of Atum-Ra, progenitor of Osiris. According to Martin Short:… if Jahbulon means anything, it means ‘God, the Lord of On’, or possibly ‘HeWho is the Lord of On’. Whether that god is the sun-god Ra or Osiris, the God ofthe Dead, depends on which period of Egyptian history takes your fancy.38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1284]Naturally most modern Freemasons vehemently deny all this, arguing that theancient images and deities found in Masonic rituals are only used in a symbolicmanner and then merely to emphasize or represent ideas that are entirelyharmonious with Christianity.But something that is rarely discussed remains unexplained about the nameJahbulon.In Masonic Royal Arch iconography, the Pythagorean triangle is often shownalongside Masonic symbols such as the stonemason's block, the chisel and themace. Now the pseudo-biblical setting in which the Royal Arch rituals unfold isderived from the so-called Old Charges, already discussed in Chapter Thirteen.The reader will recall that these Old Charges are a compilation of medievalmanuscripts which provide an account of the ancient origins of Freemasonry. Inone of these, the Beswicke-Royds Manuscript dating from the 16th century, thereis a description of the so-called ‘seven liberal arts and sciences’ and thestatement that all the sciences in the world are to be found in ‘geometry’.39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1285]Right across the whole spectrum of Masonic writings the discipline of ‘geometry’continues to this day to be given a place of honour along with its ancient‘fathers’ such as Euclid and, more especially, Pythagoras. Indeed Pythagoras’famous square-root-triangle theorem pops up in many Masonic illustrations andcan even be seen on the frontispiece of the 1723 Masonic Constitutions. Thecurious sanctity and reverence that Freemasons give to geometry is such that theletter ‘G’ – commonly seen inside the symbol of the Masonic triangle or ‘BlazingStar’ where it denotes the ‘Grand Architect of the Universe’ – also apparentlystands for ‘geometry’. By the same logic, the Masonic ‘Supreme Being’ Himself isoften called the ‘Great Geometrician’.Now the connections of Pythagoras and also of Euclid with ancient Egypt werewell known to 18th and 19th century historians, who read the classics. Manyclassical chroniclers such as Cicero, Diogenes, Isocrates, Porphyry, Valerius,Strabo, Justinian and Clement of Alexandria, tell us that Pythagoras had longsojourned in Egypt, and Iamblichus even reports that Pythagoras stayed there for22 years. All agree that it was in Egypt that Pythagoras learned the science ofgeometry from the ancient sages of Heliopolis. The Greek chronicler Isocrateseven maintains that Pythagoras became a disciple of the Heliopolitan sages, andthe historian Plutarch went as far as to assert that Pythagoras was initiated bythe Egyptian priest Oenuphis of Heliopolis.40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1286] This almost mystical link betweenPythagoras and ancient Egypt fascinated the scholars of the Renaissance and theEnlightenment, and led many to believe that much of the sacred and pristine‘science’ or ‘knowledge’ of the ancient Egyptians had been somehow brought intoWestern tradition encoded in Pythagorean geometry.In the Old Charges reference is made to a mysterious patriarch called Jabal, the‘descendent of Lamech’,41 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1287] who isknown as the ‘Founder of Geometry’ and is often called Jabal of Geometry.42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1288] The reader will recall fromChapter Thirteen that Jabal's geometry and the other antediluvian sciences weresaid to have been recorded on two stone pillars ‘erected by the inhabitants ofthe ancient world to carry the knowledge of mankind over an impeding destructionwhich proved to be Noah's Flood.’43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1289]After the Flood, the Old Charges go on to say that ‘Hermes the Father of WiseMen’ rediscovered the two pillars ‘wherein the sciences were written and taughtthem forth’. We're told that the texts recording these ‘sciences’ were latertaken out of Egypt by Moses during the Exodus and that in this way ‘was theworthy Craft of Masons confirmed in the Country of Jerusalem.’44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1290] What is interesting about allthis is that the Old Charges are adamant that the two stone pillars carryingthis arcane knowledge were not those from Solomon's Temple, i.e. Boaz andJachin, but much older ones somehow connected to the quintessential Egyptiansage ‘Hermes the Father of Wise Men’, i.e. Thoth or Hermes Trismegistus. Areasonable conclusion would be that these ‘pillars’ were thought to be inscribedobelisks from the great sun Temple of Heliopolis, where all the great sages ofantiquity were taught the ‘seven liberal arts and sciences.’ As we have seen, inthe Bible the city of Heliopolis is called On. So if the patriarch Jabal in theOld Charges was the ‘founder’ of geometry, then it is quite possible that theword Jahbulon is a cipher to denote the ‘sacred geometry’ or ‘sacred science’ ofOn, i.e. Heliopolis.FROM GRAND LODGE TO GRAND ORIENTHaving broached the subject of the higher degrees, and of the esotericspeculation that seems inevitably to arise from them let's now return to themore general story of Freemasonry in France in the years before the FrenchRevolution.Most historians believe that Freemasonry took root in France from the Scottishlodges that we know were set up in the 17th century by the StuartJacobites-in-exile, and thus well before the creation of the Grand Lodge ofEngland in London in 1717.45 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1291] This‘Jacobite’ type of Freemasonry on the Continent was vehemently opposed byMasonic lodges later established in France under the warrant and jurisdiction ofthe Grand Lodge. In 1738, however, a general assembly of all lodges, both‘Jacobite’ and ‘English’, voted that the powerful Duke of Antin, a cousin ofKing Louis XV, be elected as Grand Master of all Freemasonry in France.46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1292]After the death of the duke in 1743, the French Freemasons elected anotherprince of the blood royal, Louis de Bourbon-Condé, the Count of Clermont, as thenew Grand Master. Among other things, the Count of Clermont was also thelieutenant-general of the king's army, abbot of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris,and a prominent member of the Académie Française.47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1293] More importantly, the Count ofClermont was the son of the Duke of Bourbon and Mlle de Nante, the latter anatural daughter of Louis XIV and his favourite mistress, the influential Mme deMontespan. But an even more powerful royal would be found. On 24 June 1772, ayear or so after the death of the Count of Clermont, the Grande Loge de Franceelected as its new Grand Master, the Duke of Chartres, the future Duke ofOrléans, first cousin of King Louis XVI. At his election the name of the GrandeLoge de France was changed to the Grand Orient de France.48[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1294] French Freemasonry under theGrand Orient quickly become very popular not only with the aristocracy but also,and perhaps more so, right across the middle classes amongst the military,academics, men of letters, the clergy and the bourgeoisie in general.In these early formative years of the Grand Orient another important Masonicinfluence was to penetrate France – an influence that had the unmistakablehallmark of the Hermetic-Egyptian ideologies that Giordano Bruno and TommasoCampanella had first imported a century before.CAGLIOSTRO AND ‘EGYPTIAN’ FREEMASONRYIn the late 1770s there emerged from Italy, like a Bruno or Campanella reborn,yet another Hermetic-Egyptian reformist. He was to prove tenacious anddetermined and would become, in a most curious way, one of the politicalcatalysts of the French Revolution.Giuseppe Balsamo, a man who is better known as the ‘Count’ of Cagliostro, wasborn in the Italian city of Palermo in 1743.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1295] Little is heard of Cagliostrountil the 1760s, when we find him in Rome working as a restorer and copier ofold paintings. There he married a ravishingly beautiful girl called LorenzaFeliciani, the daughter of a wealthy Roman coppersmith, and acquired someknowledge of medicine and alchemy. Along the way Cagliostro also managed toacquire a reputation of his own as a healer, an alchemist, and a very generousphilanthropist.By 1776, the year the American Revolution began, Cagliostro and the beautifulLorenza were in England, having travelled there via Malta and Spain. They set uphome on Whitcomb Street and Cagliostro began at once to introduce himself toMasonic circles in London. In this he had no difficulty since he carriedimpressive Masonic letters of recommendation from a certain Luigi Aquino, aKnight of Malta and brother of Prince Francesco Aquino, the Grand Master ofFreemasonry in Naples.50 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1296]Within a year Cagliostro was raised to the rank of Master Mason at the RoyalTavern Lodge in Soho.51 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1297] A verycharismatic and well-spoken person, with an added touch of glamour thrown in bythe constant presence of his beautiful wife Lorenza, Cagliostro's reputation asa healer and magician brought him amazing fame. It seems that he much impressedhis English friends by guessing correctly the winning numbers of the lottery.This ability, quite naturally, created a huge stir, with everyone trying to buywinning numbers from him. So persistent were these demands that the Cagliostroshad to close their home to all visitors except for a few personalacquaintances.52 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1298]An unfortunate incident involving an expensive diamond necklace that Lorenza waslured to accept from a cunning admirer in exchange for lottery numbers, was tobring charges of embezzlement against Cagliostro from the authorities inLondon.53 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1299] After a veryembarrassing trial that lasted several months, the Cagliostros left England inlate December 1777 in the hope of making a better life on the Continent. Theyfirst went to Bavaria, staying in hostels recommended by fellow Masons, and werewell received by the nobility of Leipzig. There Cagliostro is said to haveencountered the French Hermetic alchemist, Antoine-Joseph Pernety.54[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1300]Pernety was a Benedictine monk from the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés inParis. He had acquired some fame in 1766 for having founded a Masonic rite knownas the Hermetic Ritual of Perfection for the so-called Illuminati of Avignon, anesoteric Masonic sect.55 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1301]Persecuted by the Jesuits, Pernety had been obliged to flee Avignon, and hadspent several years in Berlin under the protection of King Frederick II. Thelatter was a keen patron of Masonic orders and had himself been initiated intoFreemasonry in 1738. Frederick II appointed Pernety curator of the Berlin StateLibrary and granted him membership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.56[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1302]In Berlin, Pernety practiced what he clearly believed to be Hermetic ‘Egyptian’astral and talismanic magic. He frequently performed at séances attended bymembers of the German aristocracy for whom it was said he invoked the power ofangels and spirits.57 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1303] Duringthese sessions Pernety addressed his new recruits with words reminiscent of theRenaissance magi:… the science into which I am about to initiate you is the first and mostancient of sciences. It emanates from Nature, or rather it is Nature herselfperfected by art and based on experience.58[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1304]CAGLIOSTRO REACHES FRANCE BY WAY OF GERMANY AND RUSSIAGermany in the 1770s was rife with exotic secret societies and Masonic orders.One of these was known as the ‘African Architects’. It had been founded in 1767by Karl Friedrich von Köppen, an officer in the Prussian army,59[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1305] who is thought to have beenbehind a strange Masonic tract, the Crata Repoa, which purports to containauthentic reproductions of initiation rituals performed in the Great Pyramid byancient Egyptian priests.60 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1306] Asodd as it may seem, this peculiar ‘Egyptian’ Masonic society of AfricanArchitects received the sponsorship of Frederick II, who even had a magnificentlibrary built for its members in the region of Silesia in south Poland.61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1307]There was also the so-called Rite of Strict Observance founded in 1756 by KarlGotthelf, better known as the Baron von Hund, who had been initiated intoFreemasonry in Paris in 1743 in one of the fashionable ‘Templar’ orders.62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1308] Baron von Hund, like theChevalier Ramsay before him, claimed that Freemasonry was linked to the medievalKnights Templar, and his own Rite of Strict Observance was to enjoy astoundingsuccess in Germany and other parts of Europe. It was in one of the StrictObservance lodges, Zur Wohltätigkeit, that the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozartwas initiated, and it is obviously from the influence of Hund's and Köppen'sMasonic rite that Mozart was to develop the theme for his famous Masonic opera,The Magic Flute, which is set in a pseudo-Egyptian context highly charged withMasonic symbolism and virtues.63 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1309]But by far the most famous of all these exotic orders, and also somewhatconnected to Hund's Strict Observance order, was an intensely anticlericalorganisation called the Illuminati of Bavaria. It had been founded in 1776 inIngolstadt by the lawyer Adam Weishaupt and was backed by the influential BaronKnigge, a Freemason and also a member of the Strict Observance.64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1310] Such German Masonic activity inthe late 1770s was to have a great influence on American ‘higher degree’Freemasonry and the Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree in Charleston, SC (latermoved to Washington, DC).65 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1311]In 1777, a year after the start of the American Revolution and 12 years beforethe start of the French Revolution, Cagliostro arrived in Germany. Heimmediately involved himself with a wide variety of Masonic orders all of whichhad in common a distinctive blend of Hermetic-Egyptianism and neo-Templarideologies.And although most Masonic historians maintain that the ‘Egyptian’ type ofFreemasonry was the invention of Cagliostro, it does very much appear that atleast some of his ideas were cribbed from Köppen's Crata Repoa. The basis of theEgyptian Rite can be summed up in Cagliostro's celebrated claim that:… all light comes from the East and all initiation from Egypt.66[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1312]Cagliostro was the first Freemason to be aware of a huge and untapped source ofMasonic recruits: women. And even though it is true that the idea of women'slodges had occurred to the Grand Orient de France as early as 1744,67[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1313] it was nonetheless Cagliostrowith his intriguing and attractive Egyptianised version of Freemasonry who, inpractice, brought the ladies flocking in droves into the Masonic world.68[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1314] It all began in 1775 whenCagliostro first set up an ‘Egyptian Rite’ lodge for women in the Hague, andwhere he was assisted by the beautiful Lorenza who would assume the role of‘Isis’ in the rituals performed. From the outset what really seemed to appeal towomen was the promise of a ‘rejuvenation’ ritual that Cagliostro and Lorenzaperformed in a pseudo-Egyptian setting. The course apparently took 40 days tocomplete, a period clearly modeled on the 40 days of embalming in ancient Egyptreported by classical authors such as Diodorus, who called this period the‘remedy which confers immortality.’69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1315] It is also said in the Bible whenJacob died in Egypt that:Joseph threw himself upon his father [Jacob], weeping and kissing his face. ThenJoseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father [Jacob]. Sothe physicians embalmed him, taking a full forty days, for that was the timerequired for embalming.70 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1316]It was widely believed that the goddess Isis had invented the rites of embalmingand rejuvenation, and therefore not surprisingly Cagliostro claimed that his ownritual was also the invention of the goddess Isis. Such claims, as well asCagliostro's amazing reputation as a healer, did wonders for his new MasonicEgyptian Rite. But things started to go wrong when his travels brought him toRussia. At the court of Queen Catherine the Great, in the autumn on 1780, thequeen herself accused him of being an imposter and a charlatan.Fleeing Russia, Cagliostro travelled to France, entering through the Alsatiantown of Strasbourg. There he met the immensely rich but also immensely naïveLouis René Édouard de Rohan, the French bishop of Strasbourg, known as theCardinal de Rohan. He was fascinated by Cagliostro who performed a ‘miracle’ bycuring Rohan's uncle, the Prince of Soubise, from a near-fatal attack of Scarletfever. The story of the ‘miracle’ went around France like wildfire, and fromthat moment on Cagliostro's reputation as a healer and magician began to opendoors for him.In the summer of 1784 he made his triumphal entrance in the city of Lyons. Therehundreds of regular Freemasons willingly deserted their lodges to joinCagliostro's new ‘Egyptian’ lodge, La Sagesse Triomphante, which he hastilyfounded to receive them. On 24 December 1784, under the ecstatic gaze of hisfollowers, Cagliostro proclaimed to the world the re-establishment of the ‘trueand ancient order of the higher rituals of Egyptian Freemasonry’. He would headit and hold the title Great Copt.71[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1317] Funds were immediately raised byhis enthusiastic disciples for the construction of a magnificent Egyptiantemple, which, predictably, was to be in the form of a pyramid.This was only the beginning of Cagliostro's meteoritic to rise to fame in Franceand his equally meteoric fall. His pyramidal ‘temple’ in Lyons was built andfinally inaugurated in 1786, without the presence of Cagliostro who by that timewas in Paris languishing in the Bastille for reasons that we'll explain in thenext chapter. Afterwards his ‘temple’ remained a landmark in the district ofBrotteaux in Lyons for many years. In 1788, the year before the Revolution, itwas proposed that a second pyramid should be erected beside it – this one inhonour of Joseph-Michel Montgolfier, the famous pioneer of the hot-air balloon,who was also a Freemason. Then in 1793 the idea was proposed yet again at thesame location, only now the pyramid was to be a mausoleum for the ‘martyrs’ ofthe massacre of 1793, when the army of the Convention attacked Lyons. It isinteresting that today, not far from this place, stands a high tower, theso-called crayon, shaped like an Egyptian obelisk with a huge glass pyramid atthe top, owned by the Crédit Lyonnais bank. It was designed in 1977 by the NewYork architect, Araldo Cossutta. Oddly, Crédit Lyonnais owns another building atLille which is designed as an inverted pyramid.But we're getting far ahead of Cagliostro's story. On 30 January 1785,blissfully unaware of what lay in wait for him at the Bastille, he made his wayto Paris.We are now four short years from the French Revolution.

But then Cagliostro and Serafina (as he now called his wifeLorenza) moved to another small residence in the Rue Saint-Claude-au-Marais.1[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1318]There Cagliostro set up an ‘Egyptian’ Masonic lodge which very soon attractedmany notables, among them the Duke of Montmorency-Luxembourg who, at the time,was Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Orient. Among the members was also thefamous musician, Jean-Benjamin de Laborde, who had been the personal valet ofLouis XV. The duke was appointed by Cagliostro as the Grand Master Protector ofhis new ‘Egyptian’ Freemasonry.2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1319]Then, in August 1785, Cagliostro, with the help of his wife, created his famousadoption lodge ‘Isis’ which immediately became a huge success with the ladies ofthe court. Among his recruits were the Countess of Polignac, the Countess ofBrienne, the Countess of Choiseul (the wife of Louis XVI’s finance minister),and many other ladies of the nobility.3[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1320]Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite rapidly became the craze of Paris, so much so thatthe ill-fated Queen Marie-Antoinette was to write in a letter to her sister:‘Tout le monde en est; on sait tout ce qui s'y passe’ (‘Every one has joined;and everything that goes on is known to us’).4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1321] Soon the sculptor Jean-AntoineHoudon, who was himself a keen adept of Cagliostro's Freemasonry, was to honourthe maestro by fashioning a bust of him. It is reported that members of thefamous Philalethes lodge, which studied the occult sciences, also fell underCagliostro's spell and converted en masse into his new Egyptian Rite. Nothing,it seemed, could now stop this selfdeclared ‘prophet of Isis’.5[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1322]FLASHBACK (1) 15TH – 17TH CENTURIES: TRADITIONS OF PARIS AS THE CITY OF ISISThere was, in fact, something about Paris itself that very much played in favourof Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite that conditioned citizens to respondenthusiastically to his claims regarding the ancient Egyptian goddess Isis.Since the early part of the 15th century it is possible to document a persistentbelief among Parisian historians that their city was somehow related to Isis.The belief probably goes back much further than that but is confirmed in acollection of manuscripts dating from around 1402 kept at the BibliothèqueNationale in Paris. In these rare medieval documents we can find miniaturedrawings showing the goddess Isis dressed as a French noblewoman arriving byboat in Paris, where she is greeted by French nobles and clergymen6[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1323] bearing the title ‘the veryancient Isis, goddess and queen of the Egyptians.’7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1324] It is the ‘boat of Isis’ that isstriking in these medieval miniatures for it bears an uncanny resemblance to theboat that was also placed on the medieval coat-of-arms of the city of Paris.8[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1325] And during the same period weknow that Parisians believed the name of their city to have been derived fromthe name of Isis. For example, a 14th century Augustine monk called Jacques leGrant wrote that:In the days of Charlemagne [eighth century AD] … there was a city named Iseos,so named because of the goddess Isis who was venerated there. Now it is calledMelun. Paris owes its name to the same circumstances, Parisius is said to besimilar to Iseos (quasi par Iseos), because it is located on the River Seine inthe same manner as Melun.9 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1326]In 1512, another French historian, Jean Lemaire de Belges, reported that an idolof the goddess Isis had been worshipped in a temple immediately outside thesouthern gate of Paris, where now stood the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. 10[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1327] And the same was reported by manyother contemporary writers, notably the 16th century Parisian historian GillesCorrozet, who is reputed to be the first historian ever to produce acomprehensive guide to the city of Paris. In 1550 Corrozet also published ahistory of Paris titled Les Antiquitez, Histoire et Singularitez de Paris, inwhich he wrote that,… coming to the imposition of the name [of Paris], it is said that there, wherestands St. Germain-des-Prés, was a Temple of Isis of whom it is said was thewife of the great Osiris or Jupiter the Just. The statue [of Isis] having comein our times, of which we recall … This place is called the Temple of Isis and,for the nearby city, this was called Parisis … meaning near the Temple ofIsis.11 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1328]The early 17th century French editors Pierre Bonfons and Jacques du Breulrepublished Corrozet's book under their own names and titled Les Antiquitez etchoses plus remarquables de Paris, recueillies par M. Pierre Bonfons etaugmentées par frère Jacques du Breul in 1608. Jacques du Breul was a Jesuitmonk from Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and thus presumably conversant with therecords kept at that abbey. It is therefore of great interest to find himwriting as follows:… at the place where King Childebert [fifth century AD] had constructed thechurch of St. Vincent now called St. Germain, and to which he donated his fiefof Issy, the consensus was that there was there a Temple of Isis, wife ofOsiris, also known as Jupiter the Just, and from whom the village of Issy gotits name, and where can still be seen an ancient edifice and murals which arebelieved to be from the castle of Childebert.12[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1329]In 1612 yet another French historian, André Favyn, reported that the church ofNotre-Dame des Champs also once possessed an idol of Isis similar to the onefound in the nearby Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés:I believe this was due to another idol, for the proximity that there is with[Notre Dame] and the Abbey of St. Germain-des-Prés where was venerated Isis,called by the Romans Ceres …13 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1330]During the reign of Louis XIV an archaeological discovery was to add even morefervour to this widely held set of beliefs linking Isis with Paris. In 1653, aswe reported in Chapter Twelve, a worker digging the foundation of a new vicaragein the city of Tournai stumbled across an ancient tomb containing hundreds ofgolden ornaments. The tomb was thought to belong to Childeric, a fifth centuryFrankish king and legendary ancestor of the French monarchs.14[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1331] Among the ornaments found within,and at a second site discovered nearby, was a statue of Isis, the head of anancient Egyptian ‘Apis’ bull (associated with the Osiris and later Serapiscults) and also some 300 golden bees. It was known, even at the time, that thesymbol of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs was the bee, which was immediately takento mean that there was a link between the ancient solar pharaohs of Egypt andthe ancient solar kings of France.FLASHBACK (2) 1665: THE MYSTERY OF THE DEVIATED AXIS (1)In 1665 the Childeric treasures were sent to Louis XIV who had them stored inhis personal Cabinet des Médailles. We saw in Chapter Fourteen that the sameyear also witnessed a gathering in Paris of a powerful cabal of architects andcity planners, including the stellar figure of Gian Lorenzo Bernini from Italy,Christopher Wren from England, and France's own André Le Nôtre. Wren was thereto learn and listen. Bernini was designing the new façade of the Louvre Palace,and Le Nôtre was planning the Tuilleries Garden on the west side of the Louvre.The central axis of the Louvre is set roughly east-west, running more or lessparallel to the River Seine, which flows immediately to the south, and the Ruede Rivoli, which runs immediately to the north. If we follow the axis west today(i.e. towards the Tuilleries Garden) we will find that it passes through theapex of a huge glass Pyramid installed in the courtyard of the Louvre in 1984and then, further west, through the centerline of the Arc du Carrousel (atriumphal arch built by Napoleon in 1806). At this point something strangehappens – and it is the result of Le Nôtre's work in the 17th century. Insteadof extending the ‘axis of the Louvre’ further to the west along its existingalignment, Le Nôtre made a deliberate decision, whilst developing the TuilleriesGarden, to deviate it a few degrees to the north – such that it now runsprecisely at 26° north-of-west.15 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1332]At first glance, it would appear that Le Nôtre may have wanted to adjust thealignment of the axis in order to have the Tuilleries Garden run more preciselyparallel to the flow of the River Seine. That would seem a logical and practicaldecision for an urban architect to make. But still, why did he opt for exactly26° and not, a rounded value such as, say, 25° or even 30°? We might supposethat the choice was arbitrary but for one very important point …A few hundred yards downriver from the Louvre is the famous Cathedral of NotreDame on the Île de la Cité, a small and peculiarly boat-shaped island in theRiver Seine. Here we find the alignment of 26° north-of-west incorporated intothe axis of the cathedral itself.16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1333] Our point is that not only thatNotre Dame's axis was established centuries before Le Nôtre but also that thereis no obvious practical reason, in the case of the cathedral, that could accountfor this 26° alignment. It is not likely to be a coincidence that two majormonuments within a few hundred yards both have the same axial alignment. If theangle is meaningful, however, then what does it mean?The clue, we suggest, is the Sun. Let's not forget that Le Nôtre was planning aprogramme of monumental works for the Sun King. It should hardly be surprising,therefore, if solar symbolism were to be incorporated into such schemes. Furtherevidence that this is probably the right approach comes, yet again, from theanomalistic alignment of Notre Dame. As the Parisian historian Jean Phaure hasobserved, the axis of this great cathedral starts at an angle of 23.5°north-of-west but incorporates a deliberate deviation to the final figure of 26°north-of-west.17 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1334] Why?Readers with even a basic education in astronomy will recognize as we did thatthe angle of 23.5° has solar significance since it represents exactly thepositive and negative declinations of the Sun at the summer and winter solsticesrespectively. But if this is to be the explanation for the axis of Notre Damethen why the deviation to 26°? Is it another solar alignment?Let's first understand the significance of the angle of 23.5°.The sun's altitude in the sky, measured at noon, changes throughout the year. Itis at its highest at mid-summer (the summer solstice) and at its lowest atmid-winter (the winter solstice). These regular annual changes occur because theaxis of the Earth is titled at an angle of 23.5° relative to the solar plane(referred to by astronomers as the ecliptic). Like a cosmic skewer passingthrough the north and south poles, this oblique axis governs our relationship tothe Sun at all times and is, of course, the true axis mundi of our planet. Thereader will recall from Chapter Fifteen how the spire of St. Paul's Cathedral inLondon was taken to symbolise the axis mundi and also how John Evelyn sought toequip St. Paul's with intense solar symbolism through his sephirothic scheme. Wesuggest that the angle of 23.5° in the axis of Notre Dame may have been intendedto express a similar solar connection.The sun's position changes throughout the year not only at noon (theastronomical ‘meridian’ or mid-line of the sky) but also at all other pointsalong its arc – including, of course, at its rising and setting points on thehorizon. At the latitude of Paris (48°, 51’ north), an observer looking west(the general direction of Notre Dame's alignment) will note that the Sun sets atabout 38° north-of-west at mid-summer and at about 38° south-of-west atmid-winter. On other days of the year the Sun sets at points in between thesetwo extremes moving from north to south for six months and then travelling backfrom south to north again in the next six months. Obviously, with thispendulum-like swing, the Sun will set at any selected point within the rangetwice in the year (once on its journey from north to south and a second time onits journey from south back to north).According to researcher and author Jean Phaure the second angle incorporatedinto the axis of Notre Dame Cathedral – i.e. the angle of 26° north-of-west – isto be explained by this pendulum swing of the Sun along the horizon. It turnsout that the two days of the year when an observer at Notre Dame would see theSun setting at 26° north-of-west are 8 May and 6 August – both dates ofimportant Roman Catholic religious festivals.The first, 8 May, marks Saint-Michel de printemps, a very popular feast inmedieval times commemorating the miraculous apparition in the fourth and fifthcenturies AD of the Archangel Michael on various mounts in Europe – for exampleon Mont Saint-Michel on the Brittany coast of France and on St. Michael's Mountin Cornwall, Britain. Michael the Archangel is the guardian prince of God'speople, revealed in the Bible to be the ‘captain’ of God's army (Daniel 12:1,Joshua 5:14) – a role which many European monarchs were keen to project uponthemselves.The second date, 6 August, marks the Transfiguration of Christ, which remains animportant feast in all of Christendom to this day. It commemorates the occasion,described in the New Testament, when Jesus was accompanied by his disciplesPeter, James and John to the top of a mountain; there Moses and Elijah appearedand transfigured Jesus, making his face and clothes become white and shining aslight (Mark 9:2 – 13; Matthew 17:1 – 13; Luke 9:28 – 36). We can understand,then, why Roman Catholicism has frequently associated ‘shining’ solar symbolismwith the figure of Christ (for example his iconographical representations as aSol Invictus in the early Roman Church).18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1335] It's obvious, too, that manyChristian festivals track the solar cycle – such as Christmas (winter solstice),the Feast of St. John (summer solstice), Easter (the spring equinox), and soforth.19 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1336]Now in the Bible Elijah is prophesied to appear before the coming of the Jewishmessiah, but Jesus maintains that this prophecy had already been fulfilled whenElijah appeared as John the Baptist (Matthew 17:9 – 13). Another biblicalprophecy states that at the time when the messiah is about to appear: ‘Michaelwill stand up, the great prince who mounts guard over your people.’ (Daniel12:1). Many Christians took this second prophecy as an indication that Michaelthe Archangel was to be the harbinger of Christ's Second Coming. For just as Godsent Elijah in the form of John the Baptist to herald the first coming of theChrist on earth, so too will He send Michael at the end to proclaim Christ'sSecond Coming. And this appearance, the traditions leave no doubt, is to takeplace on a ‘mount’. The Jews are clear that the setting is to be Mount Zionwhere Solomon's Temple stood. But for Christians the location of the SecondComing was for grabs – hence the many claims of St. Michael's appearance onmounts all over Europe in medieval times.FLASHBACK (2) 1665: THE MYSTERY OF THE DEVIATED AXIS (2)It seems obvious that complex interconnecting solar symbolism was at work in thechoice of the angle of 26° north-of-west for the final axis of the medievalCathedral of Notre Dame and thus in its linkage to the Feasts of Saint-Michel deprintemps (8 May) and the Transfiguration (6 August). But let's not forget thatthis same axial alignment of 26° north-of-west was also much later adopted by LeNôtre for the Tuilleries Garden and the Champs-Élysées (along what was to becomethe ‘historical’ axis of Paris). So it is interesting that in Le Nôtre's epoch –the epoch of the Sun King Louis XIV – the date of 6 August which commemoratesthe Transfiguration could boast not one but two significant sky events linked tothe angle of 26°.The first event, we already know, was sunset at 26° north-of-west, in line withthe axis of Notre Dame Cathedral and the Historical Axis of Paris. The secondevent was the so-called cosmic rising of Sirius (i.e. the rising of the star atthe same time as the sun).20 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1337] Thisalso occurred on 6 August, but, impressively, in the exact opposite direction –i.e. at 26° south-of-east, in direct line with the reverse view along the axis –and, of course, not at sunset but at sunrise.Another matter also beckoned for attention. With the benefit of hindsight, weknew that along the Historical Axis of Paris would one day be raised a hugesolar talisman: an obelisk from ancient Egypt. The reader will recall fromChapter One that this obelisk came from Luxor, the ‘Heliopolis of the South’ anda ‘City of the Sun’ par excellence of the ancient world. One of a pair that hadstood outside the Luxor temple (the other still remains there in situ), the‘Paris’ obelisk belonged to Pharaoh Ramses II, ancient Egypt's most powerfulsun-king whose very name means ‘son of the Sun’.21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1338] This obelisk thus creates anobvious symbolic link across the ages between two powerful solar kings – i.e.Ramses II and Louis XIV.Furthermore, as we've seen in Chapter Ten, Luxor was an integral part of themuch larger sun temple complex of Amun-Ra at Karnak. And here we find somethingvery interesting indeed – for it turns out that just like the Historical Axis ofParis, the axis of the Temple of Karnak was set out by its architects along analignment 26° south-of-east in one direction and 26° north-of-west in the other…FLASHBACK (2) 1665: THE MYSTERY OF THE DEVIATED AXIS (3)No adjective in the English language can adequately describe the great suntemple complex of Amun-Ra at Karnak. But ‘grandiose’, ‘breathtaking’ and‘awe-inspiring’ all apply. Known in ancient times as Ipet-isut, the ‘mostsplendid of places’, the central axis of this outstanding temple is over half akilometer long, targeting the Theban hills and the Valley of the Kings in thewest across the Nile where Egypt's mighty sun-kings were buried. The approach tothe temple is also from the west along an impressive monumental avenue flankedby ram-headed sphinxes. As you pass the so-called First Pylon – massive inclinedwalls that serve to frame the gateway – and into a spacious open court, therelooms ahead of you a huge statue of Ramses II. You then enter the GreatHypostyle Hall with its 134 massive rounded columns and cross beams that oncesupported a roof 25 meters above the floor. A series of other pylons finallytakes you to the inner sanctuary of the sun-god Amun-Ra. When the distinguishedBritish astronomer Sir Norman Lockyer visited Karnak in 1891 in order to measurethe alignment of its axis, he was bedazzled by what he saw:This Temple of Amun-Ra is beyond all question the most majestic ruin in theworld. There is a stone avenue in the centre, giving view towards the northwest,and this axis is something like 500 yards in length. The whole object of thebuilder of the great Temple of Karnak – one of the most soulstirring templeswhich have ever been conceived or built by man – was to preserve that axisabsolutely open; and all the wonderful halls of columns and the like, as seen onone side or other of the axis, are merely details; the point being that the axisshould be absolutely open, straight and true. The axis was directed towards thewest hills on the west side of the Nile, in which are the tombs of the kings …There were really two temples [dedicated to the sun-god in his forms as Amun-Raand Ra-Horakhti] in the same line back to back, the chief one facing sunset atthe summer solstice, the other probably the sunrise at the winter solstice … itis easy to recognise that these arrangements bear out the idea of anastronomical use of the temple …22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1339]Lockyer, who described this temple as a giant ‘horizontal telescope’ permanentlyaimed at the western horizon, calculated that its axis was aligned about 26°north-of-west, the place of setting sun at the summer solstice at the latitudeof Luxor.23 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1340] But, as he pointsout, the axis not only points towards the summer solstice sunset at its westernend, but also towards the winter solstice sunrise at its eastern end. For it isan astronomical peculiarity that if an axis is aligned to the summer solsticesunset (looking westwards) this same axis will by necessity also be aligned inthe opposite direction towards the winter solstice sunrise (looking eastwards).So had the ancient builders wanted to aim the temple's axis at the summersolstice sunset or, the other way, at the winter solstice sunrise? The answer,as odd as it may first seem, is probably at both.In ancient Egyptian texts we are told of a very important feast called Mesora,literally the ‘birth of Ra’ (the Sun). This feast took place on the New Year'sDay of the civil (solar) calendar, the 1st day of the month known as Thoth. Whenthe civil calendar was introduced in circa 2800 BC, the ‘birth of Ra’ festivalwas not far adrift from the summer solstice. But by the time the temple complexof Karnak-Luxor was begun in c. 2000 BC, the birth of Ra had ‘moved’ six monthsahead to the winter solstice. This was because the Egyptian civil calendar wasbased around a ‘idealised’ year of 365 days that did not take into account theextra ¼ day in the true solar year, causing it to drift away from its originalstarting point at the summer solstice at the rate one day every four years. Itcan thus be seen that the great solar temple complex of Karnak-Luxor, which wasbegun in c. 2000 BC, was not merely dedicated to the Ra (the Sun) in generalbut, more specifically, to the ‘birth of Ra’ which fell on the 1st of Thoth. Asprovocative and controversial at it may be, this question must nonetheless beasked: Could André Le Nôtre, aided perhaps by the astronomers from the Académiedes Sciences – who had been housed in the Louvre since 1663 – have consciouslyset out to create the same solar alignment for the Sun King of France as that ofhis ancient Egyptian counterparts?FLASHBACK (2) 1665: THE MYSTERY OF THE DEVIATED AXIS (4)There is a further curious astronomical fact to add to this already veryintriguing collection of ‘coincidences’. We have seen in Chapter Ten how apowerful celestial marker – the heliacal (dawn) rising of Sirius (represented bythe goddess Isis in Egyptian and Hermetic mythology) was used by the ancientEgyptians to symbolise and sanctify the birth of their solar pharaoh-kings. TheAmerican astronomer Ronald Wells, a recognised authority on ancient Egyptianastronomical lore, has this to add:The goddess Isis, a daughter of Ra (the sun-god), was also identified withSirius. The relationship came about astronomically not only because Sirius isthe brightest body of the night (apart from the moon) like the sun is thebrightest body of the day, but more particularly because the place of itsheliacal rising on the horizon is very close to the same point where Ra rises onthe morning of his winter solstice birth. Its yearly appearance at nearly thesame spot coupled with the fact that the river began to rise about the same timemade the combined event sacrosanct.24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1341] [Emphases added]The angle that Sirius makes with due east at rising is not the same when seenfrom different places on the planet. The further north one travels, the largerwill be the angle. For example, from Paris, which stands very close to latitude49° north, the angle today is 27.5°, whereas from Cairo (at latitude of 30°north) it is only 20°. A second factor also affects the angle at rising oververy long periods of time. This is the phenomenon of precession – a very slow‘wobble’ of the Earth's axis with a cycle of about 26,000 years. Calculationstaking both these factors into account show that in 1637, the year Louis XIV wasborn, Sirius rose at 26° south-of-east, and thus in direct alignment with LeNôtre's axis!We know that since time immemorial the heliacal rising of Sirius, the star ofIsis, was the cosmic sign that sanctified the supernatural ‘birth’ of thesun-kings of Egypt. We've seen how the cult of Isis was brought to Paris by theRomans. Indeed it may well be relevant that the Cathedral of Notre Dame itselfstands over a very ancient sacred site which, according to some historians, wasa shrine dedicated in Roman-times to Isis-Ceres.25[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1342] We've also seen in Chapter Twelvehow Louis XIV was supposedly conceived in Anne of Austria's private apartmentsat the Louvre on a stormy December night in 1637 – the so-called Capetianmiracle. Putting all this together, how likely is it to be a coincidence thatwhen the Le Nôtre's ‘Sirius’ axis of 26° is extended eastwards into the Louvreit passes right through the apartments of Anne of Austria where the ‘Capetianmiracle’ took place in 1637? And is it also a coincidence that three centurieslater, in 1989, an equestrian statue sculptured by Bernini for the Sun KingLouis XIV depicting him as Alexander the Great (the quintessential classicalsolar king of antiquity), was brought from its former home at Versailles andcarefully positioned in the open court of the Louvre in the direct path of thisaxis? …The reader will recall that the birth of Louis XIV on 5 September 1638 had beenprophesied more than a year earlier by the Hermetic philosopher TommasoCampanella in 1637. Campanella had also predicted that the future king wouldtransform Paris into the ‘Egyptian’ City of the Sun. Intriguingly, Jean Phaurereports that when André Le Nôtre extended the 26° angle of the axis of theTuilleries Garden further to the west to form the Champs-Élysées in 1665 – 67 heseems to have anticipated in his overall scheme the inclusion at a later date ofcertain other elements:Le Nôtre ébauche en plan une croix, prévoit une étoile et projette soit unobélisque, soit une porte solaire analogue au portes Saint-Martin et Saint-Denisélevées sous Louis XIV. (‘Le Nôtre placed in his plan a cross, foresees a starand projects either an obelisk or a solar gate. Similar to those of St. Martinand St. Denis built at the time of Louis XIV.’)26[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1343]This is most interesting, not least because it was not until more than a centurylater, that two prominent monuments, one representing a ‘star’ and the other theobelisk of Ramses II brought from Luxor, would, in fact, be raised right on theaxis of the Champs-Élysées as set out by André Le Nôtre.CAGLIOSTRO AND THE AFFAIR OF THE QUEEN'S NECKLACEIn Chapter Eighteen we'll pursue these matters further. But first we'll finishthe strange story of the self-styled ‘Count’ of Cagliostro and see how hisdramatic rise to fame and fortune in Paris after his arrival there in 1785 wouldbe rudely stunted by his own mentor, the Cardinal de Rohan. For the latter wasabout to make one of the greatest blunders in history – a small folly that wouldset in motion untold consequences for France and the world …It all had to do with an obsession that the Cardinal de Rohan had concerning thequeen, Marie-Antoinette. The latter had rebuked him at court, and the cardinalwas desperate to make amends in whatever way he could. In the summer of 1785 acertain Countess de la Motte, who claimed to be an intimate friend and closeconfident of the queen, approached the cardinal and offered to help him in thisdelicate matter.27 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1344]The countess suggested that the cardinal should purchase on behalf of the queenan expensive diamond necklace, owned by the jewelers Boehmer & Bassenge. Thequeen dearly wanted this necklace, explained the countess. However, on accountof the near bankruptcy of the country and the hostile attitude of the Parisianpublic towards the queen's extravagance, King Louis XVI had refused to buy itfor her.The jewelers wanted a staggering price – 1,600,000 livres, enough to have fedall the hungry of Paris for several months – but the foolish cardinal refused tobe deterred. He was shown a very convincing – but forged – letter allegedlywritten by the queen, and the countess even arranged a nocturnal meeting in theGardens of Versailles between the cardinal and an imposter disguised as thequeen. The ‘queen’ confirmed to the cardinal that she could pay for the necklaceout of her own pocket money if only the cardinal could pay the first deposit. Sothe over-excited cardinal rushed to the jewelers and bought the necklace oncredit on behalf of the queen. He then gave it to the Countess de la Motte whoassured him that it would be handed immediately to Marie-Antoinette.The countess, of course, did nothing of the sort, but vanished with thenecklace. When the jewelers presented the queen with the invoice for the nextinstallment of the huge sum of money they thought she owed them an enormousscandal ensued. The queen, furious at how she had been so vilely implicated inthis sordid affair, urged the king to press charges of fraud against thecardinal. The king reluctantly agreed.It was a grave mistake, for it was obvious to all that the naïve cardinal hadbeen the victim of a very clever embezzler. Knowing how unpopular the queenalready was among the people, he made emotional appeals in court and managed tocause a huge political fuss. Matters got worse when the king tried to putpressure on the judges to condemn the cardinal. The net effect was to elevatethe Cardinal de Rohan into a symbol of the oppression, despotism and financialprofligacy of the monarchy. According to Masonic author, Jean-André Faucher,there was a widespread conspiracy behind all this involving many prominentFreemasons who were determined to have the cardinal, also a Freemason,released.28 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1345] Among them was theDuke of Montmorency-Luxembourg together with other notables such as the Marquisde Lafayette and Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, better known as the Count ofMirabeau.29 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1346] As a result the mostthe king was able to extract from an unsympathetic court was an order suspendingthe cardinal from office and exiling him to an abbey in the Auvergne.Inevitably, Cagliostro, Rohan's colourful protégée, was dragged into the scandaland made its scapegoat. The king had him arrested, hastily tried and sentencedfor fraud, and thrown into the Bastille in August 1785. There Cagliostro was toremain for nearly a year. Finally, in early June 1786, after much pressure fromthe Parisian public and behind-the-scenes manipulation by his Masonic friends,he was freed. It is reported that when Cagliostro walked out of the Bastillethere was a huge Parisian crowd cheering him as a national hero.Some historians have suggested that the trial of the Cardinal de Rohan and theunfair imprisonment of Cagliostro catalysed the growing discontent against themonarchy and led directly to the French Revolution. Rather than clear thequeen's name in the scandal, the kangaroo courts set up to try Rohan andCagliostro did the opposite. They highlighted the unpopularity and frivolity ofthe queen, the weakness of the king and his blatant abuse of the law. The Germanphilosopher, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a Freemason, called the ‘Affair of theDiamond Necklace’ the ‘preface of the French Revolution!’30[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1347] The whole fiasco ended up makingthe Cardinal de Rohan and Cagliostro appear to be – as in a sense they were –the victims of a corrupt state ruled by a weak and pompous monarch.Nonetheless, Cagliostro wisely decided to move to England. There he was at firstgreeted with much enthusiasm by the Masonic lodges but his ‘Egyptian Rite’ didnot prove popular and he ended up being shunned and ridiculed.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1348]PROPHET OF REVOLUTION PLAYS WITH FIRE IN ROMELater in 1786, safely in London, Cagliostro published his famous Letter to theFrench People in which he urged them, with incredible premonition, to make a‘peaceful revolution’, to destroy the Bastille and to replace it, perhaps, witha ‘Temple of Isis’.32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1349]But Cagliostro left his place of safety. In the spring of 1789 he made the samefatal error as Giordano Bruno almost two centuries before: he decided to returnto Italy. He arrived in Rome in May 1789, two months before the Parisian mobwould storm the Bastille. In Rome Freemasonry had officially been banned since1738, and Cagliostro, who tried to set up an ‘Egyptian Rite’ lodge there was,quite literally, playing with fire.When the news of the fall of the Bastille reached Rome, it caused pandemonium atthe Vatican, where the cardinals were alarmed by the virulent anti-clerical toneof the French anarchists. Rumors of Masonic plots were rife. By then the Vaticanhad a complete file on Cagliostro's activities, and he was promptly accused ofsubversion and heresy. On 27 December 1789 Pope Clement XII signed the order forCagliostro's arrest. He was at first sentenced to suffer the same awful fate asBruno and the Cathar perfecti of earlier eras, but it was thought to be unwiseto have yet another public burning in such unsettled times. Accordingly the popeshowed ‘clemency’ by altering the death sentence to one of life imprisonment.Cagliostro was taken to a prison at San Leo near Naples, cast into a dungeonthere, and never seen again. It was eventually discovered that he had died in1795, at the age of 52, in what can only be described as very suspiciouscircumstances.33 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1350]Historians downplay Cagliostro's role as a catalyst for the French Revolution,and he is often presented – we have to say understandably – as some sort ofembezzler, charlatan or con man. The attitude of many Freemasons seems to bethat his activities were a brief and best-forgotten embarrassment. Yet thefurore caused by his trial in Paris, and the fact that an estimated 8,000citizens, many of them Freemasons, came to cheer him when he was released fromthe Bastille, seem to tell another story.34[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1351] There is at least one Masonichistorian, Manly P. Hall, who likewise seems to regard Cagliostro's career in apositive light:[Cagliostro] founded the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry, which received into itsmysteries many of the French nobility and was regarded favorably by the mostlearned minds of Europe. Having established the Egyptian Rite, Cagliostrodeclared himself to be an agent of the Order of the Knights Templars and to havereceived initiation from them on the Isle of Malta … Called upon the carpet bythe Supreme Council of France, it was demanded of Cagliostro that he prove bywhat authority he had founded a Masonic lodge in Paris independent of the GrandOrient. Of such surpassing mentality was Cagliostro that the Supreme Councilfound it difficult to secure an advocate qualified to discuss with Cagliostrophilosophic Masonry and the ancient Mysteries he claimed to represent. Court deGébelin – the greatest Egyptologist of his day and an authority on ancientphilosophies – was chosen as the outstanding scholar. A time was set and theBrethren convened. Attired in an Oriental coat and a pair of violet-coloredbreeches, Cagliostro was hauled before this council of his peers. Court deGébelin asked three questions and then sat down, admitting himself disqualifiedto interrogate a man so much his superior in every branch of learning.Cagliostro then took the floor, revealing to the assembled Masons not only hispersonal qualifications, but prophesying the future of France. He foretold thefall of the French throne, the Reign of Terror, and the fall of the Bastille. Ata later time he revealed the dates of the death of Marie-Antoinette and theKing, and also the advent of Napoleon. Having finished his address, Cagliostromade a spectacular exit, leaving the French Masonic lodge in consternation andutterly incapable of coping with the profundity of his reasoning. Though nolonger regarded as a ritual in Freemasonry, the Egyptian Rite is available andall who read it will recognize its author to have been no more a charlatan thanwas Plato.35 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1352]THE NOBLE TRAVELLERAntoine Court de Gébelin, the man who confirmed Cagliostro's knowledge ofEgyptian esotericism, was himself a prominent member of the influential ‘NineSisters’ lodge as well as a proponent of the view that the Tarot card system wasof Egyptian origin. Interestingly, Court de Gébelin believed that the ‘Star’ inthe Tarot deck labeled XVI was, in fact, Sirius, the ‘star of Isis’.36[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1353] Later we shall see how his Tarotbecame interwoven with the ‘higher degrees’ of Scottish Rite Freemasonry.Meanwhile it is reasonable to conclude that whatever one's opinion of Cagliostrothe man, it is clear that Cagliostro, the ‘Great Copt’ and founder of the‘Egyptian Rite’, had an enormous psychological impact on the events that wereslowly unfolding in Paris.It is reported, for example, that while he was in that city, and at very heightof his fame, Cagliostro had much hoped that his Egyptian Rite would receiveofficial recognition from the Duke of Orléans, Philippe, the king's cousin, whowas at the time the Grand Master of the Grand Orient.37[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1354] Through the intervention of theDuke of Montmorency-Luxembourg, who was the official Protector of Cagliostro'sEgyptian Rite as well as the chief administrator of the Grand Orient de France,it was arranged for Philippe d’Orléans to visit Cagliostro's Isis lodge in theRue Saint-Claude. It seems that Philippe d’Orléans was duly impressed andoffered his trust to Cagliostro.38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1355] Such a connection, as we willsee, almost certainly had some repercussions on the dramatic events that weresoon to implicate the Duke of Orléans in the 1789 Revolution.Apparently during his trial in Paris in May 1786 the judge had bluntly askedCagliostro, ‘Who are you?’ to which Cagliostro replied: ‘I am a nobletraveler’.39 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1356] Indeed, Cagliostrohad often claimed that he had traveled extensively in the East, particularly inEgypt and other Islamic countries. Bearing this in mind, the historian andesoteric researcher Joscelyn Godwin highlights something that may furtherexplain Cagliostro's mysterious reply to his French judges:The initiatic journey to Islamic soil has been a repeated theme of Europeanesotericism, ever since the Templars settled in Jerusalem and the mythicalChristian Rosenkreuz learnt his trade in Damascus. We find it in the lives ofParacelsus and Cagliostro, then, as travel became easier, in a whole host thatincludes P. B. Randolph, H. P. Blavatsky, Max Theon, G. I. Gurdjieff, AleisterCrowley, René Guénon, R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, and Henry Corbin. There wasvery likely some element of this in Napoleon's Egyptian campaign of 1797, whenhe announced to an astounded audience that he, too, was a Muslim …40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1357]ILLUMINATED BY REASONOther researchers, however, have wondered whether Cagliostro's answer that hewas a ‘noble traveler’ was not perhaps a coded message in Masonic language aimedat his judges in the hope that they would recognize him as an initiate of theanti-clerical and anti-monarchical Illuminati of Bavaria.41[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1358]Originally known as the ‘Order of the Perfectibilists’, we saw in ChapterSixteen that these Illuminati of Bavaria were a very short-lived butcontroversial brotherhood known in particular for their radical anticlericalstance. The Illuminati were founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, an ex-Jesuitpriest who was professor of law at the University of Ingolstadt, and given anofficial structure in 1779 by the Baron Knigge, a Freemason and member of theTemplar Order of the Strict Observance founded by the Baron von Hund.42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1359] One of Weishaupt's remarksreveals the Illuminati's ambitious plans for social and cultural reform:Princes and nations will disappear without violence from the earth, the humanrace will become one family and the world the abode of reasonable men. Moralityalone will bring about this change imperceptibly.43[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1360]According to Masonic historian Albert G. Mackey, the ‘professed object’ of theBavarian Illuminati was:… by the mutual assistance of its members, to attain the highest possible degreeof morality and virtue, and to lay the foundation for the reformation of theworld by the association of good men to oppose the progress of moral evil.44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1361]In short, what the Illuminati were after was nothing less than a massivelyambitious global reformation programme, a sort of ‘new world order’, calling forthe eradication of monarchies under one universal power run by ‘reasonable men’.It is therefore of great interest that in a rather curious statement made on theother side of the Atlantic by Thomas Jefferson, the name of Weishaupt crops upagain in connection with the idea of rendering men ‘wise and virtuous’:As Weishaupt lived under the tyranny of a despot and priests, he knew thatcaution was necessary even in spreading information, and the principles of puremorality. This has given an air of mystery to his views … If Weishaupt hadwritten here [i.e. in America], where no secrecy is necessary in our endeavoursto render men wise and virtuous, he would not have thought of any secretmachinery for that purpose.45 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1362]Although Jefferson does not specifically mention the word ‘reason’, it isevident that it was very much in his mind when writing this statement. Jeffersonhimself practically venerated ‘reason’ and was dubbed the ‘man of reason’ parexcellence, as another of his famous statements clearly shows:It rests now with ourselves alone to enjoy in peace and concord the blessings ofself-government, so long denied to mankind; to show by example the sufficiencyof human reason for the care of human affairs …46[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1363]Indeed, ‘reason’ was to become the principal virtue of both the French andAmerican Revolutions, and in France, as we recall from Chapter One, a ‘Cult ofReason’ was even proposed as a substitute for Christianity.THE EYE IN THE PYRAMIDMeanwhile, the ultra-radical Illuminati of Bavaria, that curious and unholyprogeny of Masons and Jesuits, began to send agents and emissaries all overEurope – hence, perhaps, Cagliostro's definition of himself as a ‘nobletraveller’. Like the Rosicrucians before them, the Bavarian Illuminati wereextremely secretive and preferred to travel incognito, often assuming pseudonymsand code names. Weishaupt himself took up the code name ‘Spartacus’. The town ofIngolstadt, where the Illuminati had their headquarters, was codenamed ‘Eleusis’and the whole of Bavaria was codenamed ‘Egypt’. Perceived as highlyrevolutionary and anti-clerical, the Illuminati were violently opposed by theChurch and, more specifically, the Jesuits, who eventually persuaded the electorof Bavaria, Karl Theodore, to outlaw them in Germany in 1784.47[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1364]Anti-Masonic groups often claim that the insignia of the Illuminati was the ‘eyein the pyramid’, and that the documents that bear proof of this were confiscatedby the elector of Bavaria, and are today (for reasons that need not detain us)kept under lock and key at the British Museum.48[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1365] The same symbol, however, waswell known long before the Illuminati came across it. It was widely used, forexample, by Hermetists and Cabalists from the 16th to the 18th centuries.49[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1366]Weishaupt, it will be remembered, was a former Jesuit priest, and as such mustcertainly have been familiar with the works of Athanasius Kircher, theHermetic-Cabalistic Jesuit we met in Chapter Fifteen – a magus, as the readerwill recall, who had been particularly involved with Egyptian obelisks and,through a proxy, the exploration of the Giza pyramids in 1637. Kircher madeprofuse use of the ‘eye in the pyramid’ symbol. It can be seen, for example, onthe cover of his book Ars Magna Sciendi, (the ‘Great Art of Knowledge’),50[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1367] and also on the top of anEgyptian obelisk surmounted by the so-called Hapsburg double-eagle that Kircherhad designed specially for the German Emperor Ferdinand III.51[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1368] Let us point out in passing thatthe same ‘double-eagle’ symbol, as well as the ‘eye in the pyramid’ symbol, arecommonly used in the Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree, the Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry.52 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1369]In July 1776, the same year that Weishaupt founded the Illuminati of Bavaria –and presumably by a curious fluke of history – the same ‘eye in the pyramid’ or‘eye in the triangle’ symbol was proposed for the Great Seal of the newlycreated United States of America.53[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1370] It was designed by Pierre-EugèneSimitière, a Swiss born artist who had emigrated to the colonies in 1766 andsettled in Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, bothsignatories of the Declaration of Independence, were members of the committeeset up to oversee the design, and a drawing of the Great Seal of the UnitedStates in the latter's own hand done in 1776 (preserved in the Library ofCongress archives) clearly shows the ‘eye in the triangle’.54[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1371] We shall see later how also inthat eventful July of 1776, Franklin left America for France as part of acongressional delegation to be based in Paris, and there was hailed as a hero ofthe American Revolution by the fashionable salons and the Masonic lodges.THE ILLUMINATI AND THE DUKE OF ORLÉANSHistorians of this period have noticed the coincidence of the nearlysimultaneous events of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Americaand the founding of Weishaupt's Illuminati in Germany. It is not known withcertainty whether there had been any direct contact between Franklin, Jeffersonand the Illuminati of Bavaria through the channel of French and German Masoniclodges, but it is nonetheless certain that both Franklin and Jefferson knew ofWeishaupt's organisation – and we quoted above Jefferson's remarks on Weishaupt.Jefferson's own presence in Paris from 1784 to September 1789, makes directcontact between the two a strong possibility, as we shall see in ChapterNineteen.The general view is that the Illuminati of Bavaria simply died out after theirpersecution in Germany in 1784.55 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1372]Not everyone, however, is convinced. Some believe that Illuminati membersinfiltrated Masonic lodges and stirred up political unrest in several Europeancountries, most especially in France where the Revolution would finally breakout in 1789.One of the most prolific proponents of the ‘Illuminati theory’ was thedistinguished 1920s British writer and historian Nesta Webster. Webster arguedthat a variety of secret plots hatched by the Illuminati and the FrenchFreemasons combined with other factors to precipitate the Revolution.56[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1373] Webster, and many others likeher, see the Duke of Orléans, the Grand Master of the Masonic Order of the GrandOrient, as the main culprit and behind-the-scenes agitator of the Parisianrevolutionary crowds and, more specifically, the crowd that would storm theBastille on 14 July 1789.That the Duke of Orléans played a vital role in the events of the Revolutioncannot be denied; but to what extent, and how far-reaching was his influence,are matters that have long been debated by historians. There are records fromthe Masonic lodge La Parfaite Union in the city of Rennes, that leave littledoubt that the Freemasons saw him as the main force driving the events that ledto the Revolution:It is from our temples [lodges] and from those elevated into the holy philosophy[Freemasonry] that emanated the first sparks of sacred fire which, spreadingrapidly from east to west and from south to north of France, embraced the heartsof all citizens … None of us, my dear Brethren, can ignore that it was our GrandMaster, the Duc d’Orléans, who has participated more than anyone else in thehappy Revolution that has just begun …57[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1374]If what this Masonic lodge says is true, then it is not impossible that the Dukeof Orléans could have been in collusion with agents of the Bavarian Illuminati.French historian Jean-André Faucher shows that one of the Duke's closestassociates and protégés, the Count of Mirabeau – the most outspoken of all theFrench revolutionaries, had in the year 1776, ‘visited the city of Brunswick andmet up with the Illuminati of Bavaria.’58[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1375] And although some historians haveraised doubts that Mirabeau was a Freemason, counter-evidence has surfaced thatconfirms Mirabeau's membership of the brotherhood from at least the year 1776.59[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1376]There are also telling statements made by two famous Masons of the time, theenigmatic Count of Saint-Germain and the hypnotic Franz Anton Mesmer, thatstrongly suggest the presence of Illuminati agents in Paris in the yearspreceding the Revolution. Several researchers have suggested that the term‘noble traveller’ used by Cagliostro during his court trial may have been asecret password of theirs.60 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1377] Itis surely also significant that Cagliostro, during his trial in Rome, admittedhaving been a member of the Illuminati.61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1378]OUT GOES THE DUKE OF ORLÉANS, IN COMES PHILIPPE ÉGALITÉThe Duke of Orléans was a descendent of Frederick V of the Palatinate andElizabeth Stuart of England, that ill-fated royal couple of Bohemia who seem tohave unsuspectingly catalysed the Rosicrucian fervour in Germany and the eventsof the Thirty Years War. The Duke's great-greatgrandfather, also named Philipped’Orléans, was the second son of Louis XIII and thus younger brother to the SunKing Louis XIV. In 1661 Philippe had married Henrietta of England, daughter ofCharles I, and in 1671 he married again, this time to Elizabeth Charlotte,princess of the Palatinate and daughter of Elector Palatine Charles Louis, sonof Frederick V and Elizabeth of Bohemia.62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1379]No doubt because of his ancestry, the Duke of Orléans at the time of the FrenchRevolution was an all-out Anglophile, and his obsessive affinity for all thingsEnglish was directly responsible for the development of a bizarre fad inParisian circles known as Anglomania. The Duke was a great admirer of theBritish Parliament and of the constitutional monarchy, and had openly opposedthe despotic rule of his uncle, Louis XV, who had him exiled to England in 1771.He eventually returned to Paris only to begin at once opposing the new king ofFrance, Louis XVI, who was his first cousin.In 1786 the Duke of Orléans was elected Grand Master of the Grand Orient deFrance, and thus effectively the leader of all the Freemasons in the land.Immensely rich, as sole owner of much of France's choicest real estate, the Duketeamed up with the famous revolutionary orator, Mirabeau, and the vast groundsof his private residence at the Palais-Royal became a regular meeting place forthe revolutionary crowds. Many believe that he used his great fortune to fundthe revolutionaries and some even think he was the unseen force behind thestorming of the Bastille in July 1789. Whatever the truth, it is absolutelycertain that he vehemently opposed his cousin, Louis XVI, and that he was amongthose who voted for his execution in 1793. It is also certain that the Dukeentertained the perhaps unrealistic hope that he could become king himself andform a constitutional monarchy such as in England.So fervent was his support for the Convention and the Commune de Paris – the twoprincipal revolutionary bodies that ruled France in the aftermath of theRevolution – that in 1792 Philippe d’Orléans changed his name to PhilippeÉgalité. Unfortunately, however, Philippe Égalité developed a great antipathyfor the Marquis de Lafayette, the hero of both the French and AmericanRevolutions. This, as well as other factors, led to his eventual downfall and,ironically, in November 1793 Philippe Égalité was to suffer the same fate as hisroyal cousin, when he lost his own head under the blade of the Guillotine.Nonetheless, his great ambitions for a constitutional monarchy in France wouldmaterialise with his eldest son, Louis-Philippe I, the so-called Citizen King,who was helped to the throne of France in 1830 by none other than his father'sbitter enemy of old, the Marquis de Lafayette.We shall now see how the very disturbing anti-clericalism that was to ensueafter 14 July 1789 would send a shock wave across the whole of Christian Europe,as a new but also very old religion was about to be reborn from the womb of agoddess called ‘Reason’. Ironically, this would certainly have been somethingthat would have enthralled Cagliostro who, sadly, was now rotting in the papaldungeon near Naples. For the goddess Reason, as it turned out, would muchresemble the Egyptian goddess Isis whom Cagliostro had so much extolled in Paris…63 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1380]BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE REVOLUTIONOn the morning of the 14 July 1789 a crowd of about 800 people gathered in thecity of Paris and marched in disorder towards the Bastille. Armed with anassortment of weapons they had plundered earlier from the arsenal at theInvalides, this unruly mob hurdled themselves on the poorly defended prison and,within hours, had ‘liberated’ its seven pathetic inmates.64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1381] Six of the Swiss mercenariesstationed to guard the Bastille were chopped to pieces. The head of the chiefprison warden, Bernard-René Jourdan, the Marquis de Launay, was brutally hackedoff with a blunt butcher's knife and paraded around Paris until late in thenight.65 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1382]The clichéd images of the French Revolution that most of us learn in schooldepict oppressed Parisian citizens driven to revolt by famine, despotism andtyranny, marching in unison against the king's troops while chanting theMarseillaise. The truth, of course, was a great deal more complicated than that.The economic and political conditions in France were certainly appalling, andthus ripe for revolutionaries to exploit. The winter of 1788 – 9 been terribleand very poor harvests followed. In addition King Louis XVI was an incompetentpolitical player whose attempts to deal with the state's bankruptcy played intothe hands of the agitators. All these factors created a context for theRevolution but we should not leap to the conclusion that any of them actuallycaused it.History has shown that full-blown revolutions rarely take place without a greatdeal of covert intellectual and even financial activity going on behind thescenes. In France a subversive intellectual movement had been active amongst theeducated classes and the liberal aristocracy for many years. By promoting theenlightened political visions of writers such as Voltaire, Jean-JacquesRousseau, and the so-called Encyclopédistes – many of whom were Freemasons66[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1383] – this at first loosely-organizedmovement did much to set the scene for the overthrow of the Old Regime.The Duke of Orléans, having been rudely shunned by Queen Marie-Antoinette whobitterly disliked him, had developed a deep hatred not only for her but also forhis cousin Louis XVI and for the entire court at Versailles. He soon began touse his great personal fortune to subsidize a variety of organizations, such asthe infamous Jacobin Club, that were hostile to the king and queen. There iseven evidence, somewhat downplayed by historians, that points to the existenceof a sort of shadowy ‘government-in-waiting’, led by the Duke of Orléans andother agitators, which conducted subversive propaganda campaigns in many of the600-plus Masonic lodges in France – of which 65 were in Paris. We've seen thatthe Duke was an avid admirer of Britain's constitutional monarchy. He was alsothe richest man in France and in direct line to the throne of France. All thiswould imply, if not prove, that the ‘Revolution’ may initially have beenintended not to replace but to ‘reform’ the existing monarchy into aBritish-style constitutional system under the Duke of Orléans, and that the moreradical idea of setting up an American-style republic came later.WHEN THE THIRD ESTATE FOUND ITS VOICEEarly in 1788, Louis XVI was coerced into agreeing to call a meeting of theEstates-General for May 1789. It was to prove a fatal mistake.Traditionally, there were three so-called Estates in France: the nobilitycomprised the First Estate, the clergy comprised the Second Estate, thebourgeoisie and the nation in general comprised the Third Estate. In January1789 Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès, better known as the Abbé Sieyès, published apamphlet that starkly highlighted how little say the Third Estate actually hadin matters of politics even though it represented 98 per cent of thepopulation.67 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1384] Entitled Qu'est-ceque le tiers-état? (‘What is the Third Estate?’), Abbé Sieyès pamphlet boldlyproposed the immediate drafting of a Constitution and the formation of aNational Assembly outside the nobility and the clergy. Thousands of copies ofhis article were sold and distributed all over France. And with this, the seedsof republicanism began to sprout.It is not an accident that Abbé Sieyès was a Freemason, and a member of thepowerful Nine Sisters lodge in Paris.68[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1385] In Chapter One we discussed theorigins of this important lodge, whose other members included thinkers suchBenjamin Franklin, the Marquis de Condorcet, anatomist Joseph-Ignace Guillotin,Tarot inventor Antoine Court de Gébelin, astronomer Jérôme Lalande,mathematician Charles-Gilbert Romme, and radical revolutionary leaders CamilleDesmoulins and Georges Jacques Danton.69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1386]Like Sieyès, Desmoulins had preached revolution and written a pamphlet entitledLa France Libre (‘Free France’) which was followed in June 1789 by a violentattack on the monarchy. Desmoulins was chief among those who called for an armeduprising on the eve of the Revolution during a rally at the residence of theDuke of Orléans, which was at that time serving as the command headquarters forthe revolutionaries.Danton was the founder of the dreaded Club des Cordeliers which, like theJacobin Club, was one of the most radical and influential organizations at workduring the Revolution. The Club des Cordeliers was officially known as theSociety of Friends of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, but it had inheritedthe name ‘Cordeliers’ from a former Franciscan monastery located on the Rue desCordeliers, where its first meetings were held. The Cordeliers accepted membersof all races, classes and creeds, and many were influential journalists andwriters such as Jean-Paul Marat, Camille Desmoulins, Pierre-François-JosephRobert and Nicolas de Bonneville.The disastrous meeting of the Estates-General began on 5 May 1789. The ThirdEstate had 584 representatives compared to the 290 for the nobility and 292 forthe clergy. Present were King Louis XVI and the Queen Marie-Antoinette. Manyleading Freemasons and men of letters had been elected as representatives of theThird Estate and also had a strong presence in the other two Estates as well.Among them were the Marquis de Lafayette, Mirabeau, the Duke of Orléans andRobespierre.As the days dragged on the king and his supporters appeared increasingly weakand confused, and it became obvious that they lacked any clear plan for solvingthe very real economic crisis in which the country by then found itself.Predictably, the negotiations between the Third Estate and the nobility brokedown in chaos. In defiance, the Third Estate changed its name to the Communes(the ‘Commons’), implying a constitutional monarchy by default, and Sieyès andMirabeau took the helm. Mirabeau proposed that the Communes be called the‘Representatives of the French People’. Sieyès went one better, and had the name‘National Assembly’ accepted. Immediately several members of the nobility,principal amongst them the Duke of Orléans and the Marquis de Lafayette, offeredtheir support to the National Assembly. That had been expected but a shock wavehit the clergy and the nobility when Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, arepresentative of the Second Estate, also crossed the fence to side with theNational Assembly.Born into the nobility, Talleyrand entered the clergy at an early age. In 1789,just before the fall of the Bastille, he was made a bishop by Louis XVI. As soonas he joined the National Assembly, he was among the first to propose theconfiscation of all the assets of the Church in France.70[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1387] With such radical views beingincreasingly flaunted as the weeks of discussions went by the king intervened on20 June and ordered his guards to prevent the members of the National Assemblyfrom entering the meeting hall. In response the outraged National Assembly metinstead in another hall at Versailles – one that was used by the royals forplaying tennis. Immortalized as the ‘Tennis Court Oath’, the members swore notto be moved until a constitutional monarchy was formed under a solid politicaland legal foundation.Another meeting was called with the king on 23 June, but at this point Louis XVIthreatened to exercise his divine right to rule and to act alone ‘on behalf ofthe people’. He then ordered the delegates of the National Assembly to ‘disperseforthwith’ and stormed petulantly out of the hall. The delegates remainedseated, refusing to budge. The Marquis de Dreux-Brézé, a staunch royalist andspokesman for the king, again ordered them to leave ‘in the name of the King’.He was shouted down by Mirabeau, the Freemason who was sponsored by the Duke ofOrléans: ‘Sir, go tell to those who send you that we are here by the will of thepeople, and that we will not be moved except by the force of the bayonets’. WhenDreux-Brézé reported this to the king, he is said to have replied: ‘Damn them,let them stay!’71 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1388]The dye was cast, and from here on events rushed forward like a roaring tide.Louis XVI called in his troops to Versailles, sacked his finance minister,Jacques Necker, and formed a new government to ‘oppose’ the National Assembly.But it was all too late. At the Palais-Royal in Paris the National Assembly,buttressed by the financial power of the Duke of Orléans, and with the whole ofthe Parisian population behind them, prepared for a full confrontation with theking's troops, and now the agitators were calling openly for an armed revoltagainst the Old Regime. Soon there began to be defections from the army to theside of the National Assembly. The point of no return was reached on 14 July1789 when mobs of citizens took to the streets and the Bastille was stormed.IMPREGNATING THE NATIONAL CONSCIENCEIt is, of course, not the purpose of this book, or indeed within its scope, topass in review the full complexity of the political and cultural upheavalsbehind the French Revolution. Nor can we look at all the arguments and opinionsthat have been laid for and against the involvement and influence of Freemasonryon the Revolution. For not only are the historical events lost in the chaos ofthe times, but they have also suffered much distortion, bias and misinformationunder the pen of factions wanting either to downplay the role of the Freemasonsor to play it up. Not least amongst these factions, or course, is Freemasonryitself which seems to prefer to cloud the issue. In 1976, for example, FredZeller, Grand Master of the Grand Orient de France, had this piece of peculiarobfustication to offer on the subject:… We can be assured that the Freemasons did not conspire against the throne, norworked towards the formation of the Republic. In truth, no one had thought ofthis at the time. But they had slowly, patiently, during half-a-century ofsecret discussions (and forbidden by the laws of the time) impregnated thenational conscience with the hope and will for change. In 1789 there were morethan 70,000 Freemasons in France. Not surprisingly that in the revolutionaryassemblies we note a majority of parliamentarians who were initiated in Masoniclodges!72 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1389]Even such carefully chosen words cannot entirely disguise the obviousimplication that the Masonic lodges played a major role in the events that ledto the French Revolution! In a more candid manner in 1983, the Grand Master ofthe Grand Orient, Paul Gourdot, made a declaration similar to Fred Zeller's butthen could not avoid adding that although it was the writings and examples ofthe Encyclopédistes, of Montesquieu, of Diderot, of Voltaire, that prepared the‘spirit’ of the Revolution, it was nonetheless:… those like Condorcet, Saint-Just, Danton [all Freemasons] who applied theprinciples of the formation of the First Republic with its immortal Declarationof the Rights of Man which was formulated in our lodges …73[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1390]Besides there is another aspect of the French Revolution, in which Freemasonswere also directly involved, that still requires explanation. This is thephenomenon of de-Christianisation that we introduced in Chapter One, and theattempt by the National Assembly to replace Christianity with the ‘Cult ofReason’ and the ‘Cult of the Supreme Being’ …2/100TH OF A SECONDOn the cold morning of the 21 January 1793, a huge crowd gathered in Paris atthe Place de la Révolution, today the Place de la Concorde, to watch theexecution of King Louis XVI. With his hands tied behind his back, fourexecutioners pounced on him, laid him flat facing down, and pushed his head intothe crossbeam of the dreaded guillotine. To the surprise of the Parisian mob theking behaved bravely throughout the horrific ordeal, and even attempted apoignant farewell speech to the nation, but it was rudely interrupted by thethundering roll of drums immediately preceding his decapitation. Louis XVI’slast audible words apparently were:People of France, I am innocent, I forgive those who are responsible for mydeath. I pray God that the blood that will be spilt here never falls on France!And you, unfortunate people …The guillotine, which had been improved from an old design only a short whilebefore by Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, was extremely efficient. Apparently painless,it is estimated that each beheading took just 2/100th of a second. Guillotin wasa Freemason and member of the Nine Sisters lodge. He was also an active memberof the National Assembly. He had developed this death machine specifically tocater for the anticipated high demand for executions after the fall of theBastille. But no one, however bloodthirsty they might have been, could havepredicted the thousands upon thousands of decapitations by guillotine duringthose early years of the Republic known appropriately to history as the ‘Reignof Terror’.74 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1391] After Louis XVI wasbeheaded, Marie-Antoinette was to wait a further nine months for her ownappointment with the guillotine. But some years earlier, in 1790 when she hadbeen under house arrest at the Tuileries Palace, the queen had written thesehaughty words to her cousin, Emperor Leopold II of Austria:Take heed in your country of all Masonic associations. We already can see thatall these monsters here have intentions to do the same in all other countries.Oh, that God saves my homeland, Austria, of such troubles.75[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1392]ISIS OF THE BASTILLEA few weeks before the guillotining of the queen, a very strange thing indeedhad taken place in Paris. As if arising out of some inherent need for amatriarchal figurehead, a replacement in the form of a statue of the ancientEgyptian goddess Isis suddenly appeared on the scene. It was raised in the Placede la Bastille on 10 August 1793. As we saw when we introduced this mystery inChapter One, it had been designed in haste by the artist Jacques-Louis David,who was an intimate friend of the revolutionary leader Robespierre and wasacting as minister of propaganda for the National Assembly.A coin was struck in 1794 to commemorate the occasion, and is described asbeing:… the work of the famous engraver DUPRE … which evokes the cult of Isis chosento illustrate the goddess of Reason, and is also the first commemorative coinissued in France.76 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1393]The coin preserves the image of the so-called Isis of the Bastille or ‘Fountainof Regeneration’ which, along with its pedestal, stood some 20 feet high. Thestatue depicted the Egyptian goddess sitting on her throne flanked by two lions,and at her feet was placed a large bath emblazoned with the ancient Egyptianwinged solar disc, a symbol of the pharaohs which was also much used by theHermetics, the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons.77[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1394]Isis of the Bastille was naked from the waist up, her large breasts intended toevoke the idea of fertility and regeneration for the new republic of France.From her nipples gushed out water into a pool, and the people made their way todrink the ‘water of regeneration’ while an orchestra played popularrevolutionary tunes.Jacques-Louis David, who masterminded this curious festival, had been a hero ofthe people from the very start of the Revolution. Many of his paintings –depicting heroism and republican virtues – were treated as objects of worship bythe Parisian crowds. A zealous revolutionary himself, David was famous not onlyfor his art by also for the eloquent philosophical speeches he gave at theNational Assembly. He had been the most outspoken participant in the ‘TennisCourt Oath’ and had been among those who had loudly demanded the death sentencefor Louis XVI in December 1792. Some of the more radical revolutionary factions,such as the sans-culottes (‘without culottes’), even regarded him as some sortof latter day messiah come to regenerate the spirit of France – a role whichDavid took most seriously.78 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1395]CLOSING DOWN THE CHURCHThe year before the guillotining of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, theultra-radical faction within the Revolution had begun a campaign to rid Franceof Christianity – the latter seen as an undesirable aspect of the Old Regime andthus unfit for the new Republic and its ideals.79[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1396] The full meaning of thisinitiative was felt in October 1793, when priests and nuns all over France wereforced to ‘defrock’ themselves in public while the assets of their churches andmonasteries were taken over by the state.The ultra-radical group within the National Convention – the new name for the600 or so members of the National Assembly after it had been reshuffled inSeptember 1792 – were called the Hébertists.80[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1397] It was they who most directly andmost often fanned the flames of de-Christianisation. Principal amongst them werePierre Gaspard Chaumette, a prominent member of the Commune de Paris, and theeponymous Jacques-René Hébert, a popular journalist.Hébert ran a radical newspaper, called Le Père Duchesne (‘Father Duchesne’),which enjoyed a wide circulation during the Revolution. Both Hébert andChaumette were staunch Freemasons.81[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1398] In August 1792, Hébert had becomethe leader of the ultra-radical Club des Cordeliers – previously controlled byMaximillien Robespierre, Jean-Paul Marat and Georges Danton, the so-calledTriumvir.It seems that radicals like Chaumette and Hébert not only wanted to replace the‘head’ of France, so to speak, but also the nation's very soul. An interestingaccount of these events is given by the 19th century author, the Baroness‘Emmuska’ Orczy, made famous by her books The Scarlet Pimpernel and The ElusivePimpernel. And although Orczy was a novelist, her stories are nonetheless basedon historical accounts and succeed marvelously in capturing the mood in Franceduring the Revolution:Paris 1793: … On! Ever on! In that wild, surging torrent; sowing the wind ofanarchy, of terrorism, of lust of blood and hate, and reaping a hurricane ofdestruction and of horror. On! Ever on! France, with Paris and all her childrenstill rushes blindly, madly on; defies the powerful coalition – Austria,England, Spain, Prussia, all joined together to stem the flow of carnage –defies the Universe and defies God! Paris this September 1793! … Paris! a cityof bloodshed, of humanity in its lowest, most degraded aspect. France herself agigantic self-devouring monster … That is thy reward, oh mighty, holyRevolution! Apotheosis of equality and fraternity! Grand rival of decadentChristianity … The man-eating tiger for the space of a sigh licked his powerful jaws andpondered! Something new! Something wonderful! We have had a new Constitution, anew Justice, new Laws, a new Almanack! What next? Why, obviously! How comes itthat great, intellectual, aesthetic Paris never thought of such a wonderfulthing before? A new religion! Christianity is old and obsolete, priests are aristocrats, wealthy oppressors ofthe People, the Church but another form of wanton tyranny. Let us by all meanshave a new religion. Already something has been done to destroy the old! Todestroy! Always to destroy! Churches have been ransacked, altars despoiled,tombs desecrated, priests and curates murdered; but that is not enough. Theremust be a new religion; and to attain that there must be a new God. ‘Man is aborn idol-worshipper.’ Very well then! Let the People have a new religion and anew God. Stay! – Not a God this time! – for God means Majesty, Power, Kingship!Everything in fact which the mighty hand of the people of France has struggledand fought to destroy. Not a God, but a goddess. A goddess! An idol! A toy! … Paris wanted a new religion … and grave men, ardent patriots, mad enthusiasts,sat in the Assembly of the Convention and seriously discussed the means ofproviding her with both these things which she asked for. Chaumette, I think itwas, who first solved the difficulty … it was Procureur Chaumette who firstdiscovered exactly what type of new religion Paris wanted just now. ‘Let us havea Goddess of Reason,’ he said … ‘Let the People rejoice and dance around thatfuneral pile, and above it all let the new Goddess tower smiling and triumphant.The Goddess of Reason! The only deity our new and regenerate France shallacknowledge throughout the centuries which are to come!’ Loud applause greeted the impassioned speech. ‘A new goddess, by all means!’shouted the grave gentlemen of the National Assembly, ‘The Goddess of Reason! …The goddess must be beautiful … not too young … Reason can only go hand in handwith the riper age of second youth … she must be decked out in classicaldraperies, severe yet suggestive … she must be rouged and painted … Aye! Thefeast should be brilliant enough! Gay or horrible, mad or fearful, but throughit all the people of France must be made to feel that there was a guiding handwhich ruled the destinies of all, a head which framed the new laws, whichconsolidated the new religion and established its new goddess: the Goddess ofReason: Robespierre, her prophet!’In those terrible years of 1793 – 4, all around France churches and cathedralswere violated and desecrated and, to the utter horror of the pope in Rome, thebuildings were converted into ‘temples’ for the new Culte de la Raison (‘Cult ofReason’), who was also called ‘Liberty’ or ‘Nature’. Author Kathleen Jones, inher book Women Saints, gives a detailed account of these events:In ‘the Terror’ … priests and nuns went in danger of the guillotine, and manydied when they refused to take an oath of loyalty to the new regime and toabandon their vocations. Churches were closed by troops who removed churchbells, smashed altars and crucifixes, and made bonfires of vestments andconfessional boxes. A popular spectacle was that of a priest abjuring hisvocation, and a ceremony of ‘debaptization’ was invented for the laity. Allpublic and private worship was forbidden. On 10 August 1793 the artistJacques-Louis David, a strong supporter of the Revolution, organized a secularceremony for the acceptance of the new Constitution. An enormous statue of thegoddess Nature [Isis], spurting water from her breasts into a pool, was erectedon the site of the Bastille, which had been razed to the ground. There was a newcalendar, which began not with the birth of Christ but with the proclamation ofthe Republic. The months had new names [now surviving only on the names of ParisMetro stations] and there was a 10-day week, the decadi. Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, and the harvest festival, together with saints’days, were abolished. In their place were substituted thirty-six new festivals,one every decadi, celebrating reason, courage, motherhood, temperance, hatred oftyrants, and similar ideals of the regime. On 10 November a great Festival ofReason was held in the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, where sixteen LouisCapets had walked to their coronations as kings of France. The secularized NotreDame was re-named the Temple of Liberty. The rest of France varied in its expression of the new system: localadministrators organized events varying from mildly pagan ceremonies to theactive stirring-up of public hatred against religion of any kind. In Le Havre agirl of good morals was made the goddess Reason for a day, with floral tributesand dances; in Poitiers, farther south, there were grotesque ceremonies in whichpeople dressed as sorcerers, priests, popes, monks, angels, and nuns were chasedthrough the church of Saint-Porchaire.82[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1399]CYBELE-ISISProfessor François Victor Alphonse Aulard (1849 – 1928), a highly respectedhistorian of the French Revolution, somewhat downplays these events by arguingthat the anti-clerical movement was not as pronounced and as radical as mosthistorians would want us to believe.83[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1400] But Aulard was himself militantlyanti-clerical which may have blurred his judgement of the evidence underexamination. There are other French historians and specialists of the Revolutionsuch as Michel Vovelle, director of the Insitut d’Histoire de la Révolution inParis, who have a completely different view:Between October 1793 and June 1794, a multi-faceted attack was mounted in Franceto eradicate [the Christian] religion. The goddess Reason triumphed: templeswere opened to her, represented by living persons … In tens of thousands thepriests abdicated their sacerdotal role and many of them even married …84[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1401]But by June 1794 the whole business of de-Christianisation had run completelyout of control. Even the revolutionary leader Robespierre was horrified by thechaos and sought an alternative to this degrading carnage and mess. France waswitnessing obscene pagan-like processions organized everywhere, often paradingvoluptuous women dressed as ‘Liberty’, ‘Reason’ or ‘Nature’ wrapped in blue andwhite veils and wearing the little red Phrygian cap (see Chapter One). The‘goddesses’ were followed by wild crowds chanting and dancing, all veryreminiscent of the ancient Greek Bacchanals, the Roman Hilarias and the Isiaicprocessions. The image of these processions of ‘goddesses’ wearing the Phrygiancap also brings to mind the great pagan processions of the Phrygian mothergoddess, Cybele, which took place in ancient France before the advent ofChristianity. Cybele was often linked to Isis, as authors Anne Baring and JulesCashford explain in their excellent book The Myth of the Goddess:Under the [Roman] Empire, the cult of Cybele became part of the Roman statereligion. It existed side by side with the cult of Isis … and both spread allover the Roman Empire … An interesting image to follow through differentcivilizations is the ‘Phrygian cap’, which was worn by … the priests of Cybele.This distinctive cap first appears in Crete … Later, in Greece, it is worn byHermes, messenger of the Gods … Today similar caps are worn by the Sufidervishes … Mary was worshipped at sites once sacred to Cybele and Isis.85[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1402]In his book Cybele and Attis, the scholar Maarten J. Vermaseren gives adescription of Cybele which clearly shows how this goddess was seen as theembodiment of Nature and all the cosmos:It is not only Nature that the goddess rules: her power reaches much further.She stands in the center of the Universe of Time, Sun and Moon, Earth, Water,the Sea and the Seasons. In front of her chariot stands the Tree of Life,stylized as an obelisk and entwined by a serpent …86[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1403]The French scholar Jurgis Baltrušaitis in his book La Quête d’Isis, demonstratesthe great extent to which Cybele and Isis were perceived as being the sameentity by 17th century French historians. Baltrušaitis reports that in 1675 apriest called Berrier, while digging in the garden of the Saint-Eustache church,discovered a bronze statue of a female deity wearing a strange tower on herhead. Details of this discovery were published in 1683 by Claude du Molinet,canon of the St. Genevieve church in Paris. Here is how Molinet describes thedeity:The goddess that the Greeks called Io and the Egyptians called Isis is the sameas the one the Romans honored under the name of Cybele, identified to the Earthor Nature, and the same as the Egyptians had married to Osiris …87[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1404]Baltrušaitis goes on to say that the iconography of the Cybele and Isis figuresthat were found in France were ‘identical … Cybele is crowned with a tower; Isisalso had a tower on her head …’88 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1405]CULT OF THE SUPREME BEING VEILING ISIS AGAINBy the end of spring 1794, Robespierre, now the undisputed leader of theNational Convention in Paris, had began to turn against Hébert and Chaumette.Soon enough he accused them of being ‘enemies of the Nation’ and arranged theirappointments with madame guillotine. He then decided to introduce his own ideaof a ‘republican religion’. This he named the ‘Cult of the Supreme Being’. Itssymbol was the ‘eye in the pyramid’, and Robespierre issued a decree statingthat ‘the French people recognize the existence of the Supreme Being and theimmortality of the soul’. The ‘Supreme Being’ cult was largely modeled on the‘natural’ philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who Robespierre idolized.It is clear that Robespierre considered the de-Christianisation of France asinevitable but that he also repudiated atheism and the wild excesses that hadaccompanied the Cult of Reason. What Robespierre sought to create was a newdeist cult based on republican virtues to replace the spiritual vacuum left bythe intense de-Christianisation activities of Hébert and Chaumette.On 4 June 1794 Robespierre was elected president of the National Convention. Heat once began to work closely with the artist Jacques-Louis David to prepare agrand celebration for Paris on 8 June 1794, the day of the Pentecost. Thepurpose of the celebration was to install the Cult of the Supreme Being as thenew religion for France.This curious event began in the Tuileries Garden in front of the Louvre, withRobespierre himself, draped in blue, standing next to a statue of the ‘SupremeBeing’. A huge makeshift amphitheatre was erected in order to seat the membersof the National Convention. In front of the amphitheatre had been prepared abonfire upon which, according to the programme written by Jacques-Louis David,were ‘gathered all the enemies of the felicity of the people’. The ‘enemies’were symbolized by a statue called ‘Atheism’ supported by figures called‘Ambition’, ‘Egoism’, ‘Discord’ and ‘False Simplicity’.All over Paris houses were decorated with garlands and tricolor flags, and thestreets through which the procession was to pass were lined with flowers. Prettygirls in white frocks carrying bouquets were placed along the quays of theSeine. The members of the National Convention, fully attired in their officialcostumes, filled the amphitheatre, each carrying a small bundle of wheat-ears, asymbol that Freemason and astronomer Jérôme Lalande associated at the time withthe ‘virgin’ goddess Isis.89 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1406]Lalande, as the reader will recall from Chapter One, was a prominent member ofthe Nine Sisters lodge in Paris and had been instrumental in introducing the newRepublican calendar based on the Egyptian solar year which, in ancient times,was calibrated on the heliacal rising of the star of Isis, Sirius. Earlier, in1731, Lalande had written:The Virgin is consecrated to Isis, just as Leo is consecrated to her husbandOsiris … The Sphinx, composed of a lion and a virgin, was used as a symbol todesignate the flow of the Nile … they put a wheat-ear in the hand of the Virgin,to express the idea of the months, perhaps because the sign of the Virgin wascalled by the Orientals … epi or wheat-ear.90[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1407]The Nine Sisters lodge was founded by Lalande and the Abbé Cordier deSaint-Firmin, the godfather of Voltaire, in 1776 – the same year as the signingof the American Declaration of Independence. The following year, 1777, BenjaminFranklin, the most senior of the signatories to the Declaration, was appointedGrand Master of the Nine Sisters lodge in Paris. We'll return to this intriguingconnection in Chapter Eighteen. Meanwhile let's continue to follow the progressof the Supreme Being on that balmy day of 8 June 1794.Robespierre, with his hair powdered white and his whole body wrapped in ablue-violet mantle, delivered a prayer to the crowds from a high altar: ‘Thewhole Universe is assembled here! O Nature, how sublime and delicious is yourpower!’ He then evoked the Supreme Being and asked the congregation to payhomage to Him. But at the end of his very long sermon, rather than promise anend to the carnage or offer new hopes for curbing the excesses of theRevolution, Robespierre delivered instead a chilling warning to his politicalopponents: ‘Tomorrow, when we return to work, we shall again fight vice andtyrants!’ Then the large choir, brought from the national opera, sang a hymn byFrançois Joseph Gossec entitled ‘Father of the Universe, Supreme Intelligence’.Finally Robespierre stepped towards the veiled effigy representing ‘Atheism’ andset fire to it. Jacques-Louis David had designed it such a way that when theveil burnt a stone statue of ‘Wisdom’ was revealed beneath it, modelled on theancient goddess ‘Sophia’ and meant to emerge ‘like a phoenix from the flames’.Widely used as a symbol in Freemasonry, Sophia has frequently been associatedwith Isis. According to the poet Gérard de Nerval, the statue that Robespierre‘unveiled’ on that day was, in all probability, an effigy of Isis. In his book,Les Illuminés published in 1852, Nerval speaks of the ceremony performed byRobespierre and compares it to ‘a remembrance of the practices of theilluminés’, pointing out that the ‘Veiled Nature’ used for the 8 June 1794ceremony was ‘a statue covered with a veil which he [Robespierre] lit up andwhich represented either Nature or Isis.’91[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1408]At last when the effigy was revealed to the people and all the chanting stopped,Robespierre led a cortege at the helm of a massive chariot carrying the goddessand towed by eight oxen, their horns painted in gold. The cortege passed throughthe Place de la Révolution (now Place de la Concorde), Les Invalides and finallycame to rest at the Champs de Mars where more celebrations, speeches andchanting took place.92 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1409]NOTRE DAME, TEMPLE OF THE GODDESSContemporary records confirm that the attacks on the clerical establishment in1793 – 4 were not mere acts of sporadic ‘revenge’ against individual members ofthe clergy but rather a well-organised and systematic de-Christianisationcampaign which resulted, in a matter of months, in the wholesale ‘voluntaryabdication’ of some 20,000 Catholic priests, many of whom then gladly embracedthe cult of the revolutionary goddess.93[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1410]French historian Michel Vovelle reports that the Cult of Reason first appearedduring the trial of the Marie-Antoinette, and then took off with zestimmediately after the queen's public execution on 16 October 1793.94[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1411] It has been confirmed that thefirst signs of de-Christianisation were witnessed in the Allier and Nièvredepartments on 2 October 1793 during the closing stage of the trial.Then, on 7 October, a shockwave hit the country. It was reported that arepresentative of the National Convention, an ex-pastor called Philippe Rühl whowas acting under the orders of Chaumette and Hébert, had taken the SainteAmpoule – a glass chalice containing holy oil – from the Cathedral of Reims andsmashed it in the public square. The Sainte Ampoule was said to contain thesacramental oil that had been used to consecrate the kings and queens of Francesince the time of Clovis in AD 496. When the Sainte Ampoule was smashed by Rühl,it is said that a priest, the Abbé Serrain of the village of Saint-Remi, rushedto the spot and managed to mop up some of the sacred oil.95[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1412]But Rühl's act was only a prelude. On 7 November 1793, a few weeks after thedecapitation of Marie-Antoinette, the bishop of Paris, Jean-Baptiste-JosephGobel, was defrocked in front of a large audience at the National Convention.This charade too was orchestrated by Chaumette. The bishop, who was frightenedout of his wits, promptly declared that he wanted to join the Hébertists and theCult of Reason.Three days later, on 10 November, the unthinkable happened: a large crowd,accompanied by a choir, stormed the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. Theycarried in a makeshift throne upon which sat the ‘goddess’ personified by abeautiful Parisian actress, Mlle Aubry, who was dressed in the blue, white andred republican colors and wearing the Phrygian cap. The ‘goddess’, who waslabelled ‘Liberty, daughter of Nature’, brandished a torch to signify that‘Liberty is the light of the world’.96[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1413] The whole congregation was thenled by Chaumette and the ex-Bishop Gobel to the National Convention. There itwas decreed that the Cathedral of Notre Dame was henceforth to be known as the‘Temple for the goddess Reason’.97[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1414]CITY OF LIGHTLet us note in passing that Chaumette was no ordinary Freemason. Like manyFreemasons at the time, he had acquired a taste for ‘Egyptian’ symbols andrituals. He was, for example, a keen supporter of the astronomersCharles-François Dupuis and Jérôme Lalande, and it comes as no surprise that acontemporary critic was to exclaim: ‘Messrs. Dupuis and Lalande see Isiseverywhere …!’98 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1415] It wasfashionable in Masonic circles just before the Revolution to see ancient Egyptas the source of all Masonic enlightenment,99[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1416] and we shall recall that theastronomer Dupuis was among those who argued that Isis was the original tutelarygoddess of Paris. Indeed Dupuis in 1794 published the thesis that the Cathedralof Notre Dame was actually an Iseum, i.e. a former ‘Temple of Isis’, which hadbeen converted or built upon by the Christians:This famous Isis was the goddess of the ancient French or the Sueves who joinedto her cult the symbolic boat, known as the boat of Isis. This boat still existson the coat-of-arms of Paris, the city of which Isis had become the tutelarygoddess. It is Isis, mother of the God of Light, to whom the people [of Paris]make offering and light candles at the New Year and even during the rest of theyear, in memory of the Feast of the Illumined Ones …100[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1417]Once again we note the epithet ‘God of Light’ which was used by the Gnostics andManicheans in the first few centuries after Christ, and later by the Cathars. Italso occurs in various forms in Freemasonry and in the Rosicrucian Manifestos aswe have reported in earlier chapters, but never in the Christian Bible.In support of Dupuis’ position, the astronomer Lalande wrote:M. Dupuis concluded in his research into the façade [of Notre Dame de Paris]that it is a crude copy of a frontispiece of an ancient Temple of Isis, thegoddess whose cult was long ago established in Gaul [ancient France] andespecially in Paris.101 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1418]With their clear Masonic penchant for the goddess Isis, whom they called ‘motherof the God of Light’ and also correctly identified as ‘goddess of the year’ (asshe was known in ancient Egypt)102[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1419] it is easy to understand theinspiration for the new Republican calendar that Dupuis and Lalande were closelyinvolved in creating. The reader will recall from Chapter One that thisso-called Republican calendar was built around the ancient Egyptian year of 365days, which was divided into 12 months of 30 days each with ‘five extra days’added to make up the full solar year.But along with the goddess Isis-cum-Reason-cum-Nature, the revolutionaries oflate 18th century Paris also made profuse use of other well-known Egyptiansymbols: the pyramids and the so-called Eye of Providence. It was while tryingto understand why such symbols were used that Robert Bauval stumbled on the keythat would open a secret window looking out over Paris and allow us to see anenchanted, almost-magical landscape interwoven in the modern layout of this‘City of Light’ …"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENPARIS UNVEILEDIn French Freemasonry the allegorical and metaphorical aspects [of architecture]appear to have been invested with greater significance than ineighteenth-century England. Architectural history was equated with thedevelopment of society. And architecture was seen as a means of establishing ajust and ordered system …James Stephen Curl, The Art and Architecture of Freemasonry On 14 July 1792 a republican ceremony was held at the Champ-de-Mars in Paris atwhich a ‘Pyramid of Honour’ was erected to commemorate those who died during thestorming of the Bastille.1 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1420] Anetching has survived of another republican ceremony that took place a littleover a month later on 26 August 1792 in the Tuilleries Garden next to theLouvre. Again a pyramid was raised in honour of the martyrs of the Revolution. Athird pyramid appeared in the Parc Monceau, this one commissioned by PhilippeÉgalité and designed by the architect Bernard Poyet, next to a pavilion thatprobably served as a Masonic temple. And there were many other pyramid projectsthat, though never built, still serve to show the peculiar obsession with thepyramidal form in the decades surrounding the 1789 Revolution.There are, for example, the curious projects of the revolutionary architectClaude-Nicolas Ledoux,2 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1421] aFreemason, who the architectural historian James Curl describes as being‘involved with Masonic and crypto-Masonic cults’. Indeed so involved was he withsuch interests that when a fellow Freemason from Britain, an architect, attendeda Masonic meeting in Ledoux's home in Paris, he was put out by what he felt tobe the excessively occult nature of the event. He commented afterwards: ‘itwould seem that Ledoux was more involved in the type of heretical Masonry ofCagliostro’.3 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1422] Many architectshave been intrigued by one of Ledoux's most ambitious designs, the so-called Vueperspective d'une forge à canons (‘Perspective view of a forge cannon’), an ironsmelting plant with massive pyramids and a layout that recalls ‘various versionsof the Temple complex in Jerusalem’.4[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1423]Then there are, of course, those most extraordinary pseudo-Egyptian designs bythe revolutionary architect Étienne-Louis Boullée, the most famous of which wasthe so-called Cénotaphe dans le genre égyptienne (‘Cenotaph in the Egyptianstyle’), which was a series of gigantic pyramids with their capstones missing –a design very reminiscent of the actual appearance throughout historical timesof the Great Pyramid at Giza and of the truncated pyramid seen on the Great Sealof the United States.5 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1424] JamesCurl, who is regarded as an expert on Masonic architecture, comments that ‘inspite of its title Cénotaphe, the building was clearly a cemetery or a centrefor cults, to judge from the processions going up and down the gigantic ramps.’6[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1425]IMAGING THE SUPREME BEINGWere Ledoux and Boullée thinking of the ‘Supreme Being’ in their designs?Perhaps. But both these men, like many architects of their generation, were muchinfluenced by the famous architect and Freemason Antoine-Chrysostome Quatremèrede Quincy. The latter was known for having presented a prize essay to theAcadémie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1785 on ancient Egyptianarchitecture and, more specifically, on the pyramids.7[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1426] According to James Curl, ‘Quincywas not only a Freemason, but was very powerfully influenced by his Masonicconvictions’.8 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1427]There is, too, an extraordinary project by Ledoux – Quatremère de Quincy's pupil– which is shown in his book L’Architecture Considérée published in Paris in1804. There we can see a plan for the theatre of the city of Besançon in theform of a gigantic ‘all-seeing-eye’ which James Curl describes as ‘anunquestionably Masonic allusion’.9[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1428] The same idea was used by therevolutionary architect Poyet who had designed the Parc Monceau pyramid forPhilippe Égalité. Another of Poyet's ambitious plans was for a public hospitalin Paris, where a gigantic ‘all-seeing-eye’ can easily be discerned in thegeneral layout.10 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1429]The ‘Eye of Providence’, the ‘all-seeing-eye’, the ‘eye in the pyramid’, and the‘eye in the triangle’ were all symbols of the Supreme Being, the Être Suprême ofRobespierre. Thus, for example, we have a poster dating from the Revolution,which depicts the hero-philosophers Voltaire and Rousseau pointing to a glowingsolar disc within which is the ‘all-seeing-eye’ and a caption that reads: ‘ÊtreSuprême, Peuple Souverain, République Française’ (‘Supreme Being, SovereignPeople, French Republic’).11 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1430] The‘all-seeing-eye’ is also prominent on a poster of the Fête de la Fédération atthe Champ-de-Mars dated to 1790, where the rays of the Sun shoot down to form agolden pyramid that engulfs two tricolor flags and a red Phrygian cap fixed on a‘pole of Liberty’.12 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1431]The association of the ‘all-seeing-eye’ with Voltaire on the first of theseposters is particularly interesting. It is a very well-known fact amongFreemasons that Voltaire was initiated on 7 April 1778 at the Nine Sisters lodgein Paris by the astronomer Jérôme Lalande and Benjamin Franklin.13[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1432] When Voltaire died a month later,the lodge was converted into a ‘Lodge of Sorrows’, a sort of Masonic funeraryservice, and on 28 November 1778 a service was held there for his departed soul.In line with Masonic tradition, the whole interior of the lodge was draped inblack veils. At the far end of the room was raised a stepped pyramid, alsodraped in black.14 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1433] On the summitof this pyramid was a cenotaph, and at the place where the capstone wouldnormally have been could be seen hovering a glowing triangle with the letter ‘G’inscribed in it.Such a pyramid with the same glowing capstone is, of course, to be seen on theGreat Seal of the United States, the design of which was coordinated by BenjaminFranklin and Thomas Jefferson in 1776.15[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1434] In Masonic symbolism the ‘eye’representing the Supreme Being, is interchangeable with the letter ‘G’, and bothsymbols stand for ‘God’ i.e. the ‘Grand Geometrician’ or the ‘Grand Architect ofthe Universe’. Author and professor, Michel Vovelle, also draws attention to aFrench revolutionary poster where the ‘all-seeing-eye’ is depicted over thebreast of the ‘goddess Reason’; she holds a victory wreath above a plaque onwhich appears a small ‘glowing pyramid with the eye’.16[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1435] Indeed, the same glowing trianglewith the all-seeing-eye found it way to the top of the Declaration of the Rightsof Man and the Citizen signed in August 1789 at the National Assembly. The textwas modeled on essays written by the Marquis de Lafayette and the Abbé Sieyès,two very prominent Scottish Rite Freemasons. Perhaps we ought to recall thetelling words of the Grand Master of the Grand Orient, Paul Gourdot, when heclaimed that intellectuals such as Voltaire provided the ‘spirit of theRevolution’ and that the outcome of this – the First Republic – was based on‘the Declaration of the Rights of Man which was formulated in our lodges.’17[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1436]THE CRY OF A DYING TIGERIronically, the extravagant ceremonies during the so-called Festival of theSupreme Being on 8 June 1794 were to lead to Robespierre's downfall. Not all whowitnessed the event liked his spurious display of piety and reverence towards aneffigy of a pagan deity, and even some of his closest allies were put off bywhat they saw as his increasing pompousness and vanity. Many worried that beingat the helm of the National Convention had gone to his head.The Montagnards (the ‘Mountains’) who were normally Robespierre's most ardentsupporters, began to have doubts. And being mostly atheists, many of them weredeeply embarrassed by the strange psuedo-religious shows he was now putting on.Amazingly, they found a way to accuse the previously invulnerable Robespierre ofanti-republicanism and sent him to the guillotine on 28 July 1794. His jaw hadbeen blown off by a pistol shot so he was bleeding profusely and unable to talk.All that the poor man could do was let out a frightening cry which, according toan eyewitness, sounded ‘like that of a dying tiger’.The Revolution had nearly run its course and, for a brief, tantalizing moment,the reigns of power were dangling free and there for the taking. A youngCorsican officer who had been closely monitoring these grisly events and bidinghis time was slowly getting ready to make his move.A new Alexander the Great was in the making …NAPOLEON'S GODDESSOn the evening of the 5 March 1798, a date that, oddly, coincided with thewell-known ancient Roman Feast of the Navigium Isidis, the Feast of the Boat ofIsis, a carriage under heavy military escort left Paris for the port of Toulon.In it was the new hero of France, Napoleon Bonaparte, and his lovely wifeJoséphine. They were on their way to meet up with the French fleet which waswaiting to sail to Egypt.In a mere two years Napoleon had risen from being an obscure artillery officeramidst the ‘Terror’ of 1794, to commander-in-chief of the army by early 1796. Aweek after his appointment as commander of the French army in Italy, Napoleonhad married the exquisitely beautiful Joséphine de Beauharnais,18[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1437] widow of Viscount Alexandre deBeauharnais, a Freemason and nobleman who, like many others of his Estate, hadended on the guillotine in 1794. Joséphine was the eldest daughter ofJoseph-Gaspard de Tascher de La Pagerie, an impoverished nobleman who hadsettled in Martinique where Joséphine had spent the first 15 years of her life.She had come to Paris in 1779, a decade before the Revolution, and there hadmarried the ill-fated de Beauharnais. It was an arranged marriage and neverhappy. When Napoleon met her in 1795, she was widowed with two children and onthe verge of breaking up a turbulent affair with the ViscountPaul-François-Jean-Nicolas de Barras, the commander-in-chief of the Army of theInterior. Napoleon, who was deputy-general to Barras, was only 27 years old atthe time. Joséphine was 33 and the darling of Parisian high society, into whichshe had been introduced by the beautiful Thérésa Tallien. The latter was thewife of Jean-Lambert Tallien who, along with Barras, had plotted the downfall ofRobespierre back in 1794. It was Thérésa, in fact, who had introduced Joséphineto her own lover Barras who, in turn, passed her on to Napoleon.Joséphine seems to have been attracted to Freemasonry quite early in her career– perhaps partly because it was considered to be very fashionable among women ofthe aristocracy and partly because her first husband, the Viscount deBeauharnais had been a prominent Freemason who came from a family of illustriousFreemasons.19 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1438] Joséphine wasprobably initiated in women's Freemasonry at Strasbourg while her husband, theviscount, was commander of the Rhine army.20[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1439] Long afterwards, their son,Eugène de Beauharnais, who now was about to go to Egypt with Napoleon, wouldbecome Grand Master of the Grande Oriente d’Italia and also of the SupremeCouncil of the 33rd Degree in Italy.21[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1440]When she become empress of France in 1804 Joséphine was elected as the GrandMistress and Patroness of women's Freemasonry in Paris.22[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1441] Many ladies close to her alsojoined the Masonic sisterhood. Apparently Joséphine's lady-in-waiting, Madame deCanisy, was initiated into women's Freemasonry by the wife of the mayor ofStrasbourg, Madame Dietrich, and to mark the event a commemorative medal wasstruck, showing a golden triangle at the tip of which was placed a star in acrown – almost a premonition of Joséphine's future role in France.23[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1442] Joséphine's favourite niece,Émilie de Beauharnais, wife of Antoine Marie Chamans, Count of Lavalette anddirector-general of the Imperial Postal Office, was elected Grand Mistress ofthe adoption lodge Anacreon in Paris.24[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1443]Being a Freemason initiated in the ancient mysteries, and now with all thispost-Revolution talk of deism, it may be possible that Joséphine had begun totake an interest in Islam and may even have privately encouraged Napoleon tobring it into the fold of Western Europe. For it is well known that her firstcousin and closest friend, the beautiful Aimée du Buc de Rivéry, had beenkidnapped by Arab pirates and sold to the harem of the sultan of Turkey, AbdulHamid I, where she soon became his favourite concubine and bore him a son, theEmir Mahmoud. When the old sultan died, Aimée became the mistress of theheir-apparent, the young and glamorous nephew of the sultan, the Emir Selim,over whom Aimée was to wield enormous influence by turning him into a keenFrancophile.25 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1444] There thus existeda ‘dynastic’ link between Joséphine of France and her cousin the ‘sultana’ ofTurkey, a connection which might have brought the Middle East and Islam withinJoséphine's sphere of attention. At any rate, whatever was going on secretly inJoséphine's and Napoleon's minds, he would one day write to her from Egypt thesecurious words:I saw myself founding a new religion, marching into Asia, riding an Elephant, aturban on my head and in my hand a Koran that I would have composed to suit myneeds.26 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1445]Whether or not such words were written in jest, we shall never know.INSPIRATIONS FOR THE INVASION OF EGYPTThe idea for a French invasion of Egypt was not original to Napoleon. It was thebrainchild of Talleyrand, the great French statesman and diplomat. We havealready encountered Talleyrand when, in 1789, he resigned from his role asrepresentative of the Second Estate – the clergy – and sided with therevolutionaries. But because he was in favour of a constitutional monarchy, hehad to flee France in order to save his neck as the Revolution developed. Hefirst went to England in late 1792 then, in 1794, to America where he stayedtill September 1796, after the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. Upon his return toFrance, he was made foreign minister by Napoleon.In spite having reached the position of bishop in the Catholic Church,Talleyrand was a staunch Freemason who, during the early years of theRevolution, had been a supporter of the Duke of Orléans. Talleyrand had been amember of the prestigious lodge Les Philalethes in Paris, and of the lodge LesAmis Réunis (to which Marat, Sieyès and Condorcet also belonged).27[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1446] Les Philalethes in Paris had beenmuch involved with Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite back in 1784 – 5, where it wassaid that many of their members joined his lodge in Paris. The Freemason HenryEvans explains:The controversy between Cagliostro and the Lodge of Philalethes (or ‘Lovers ofTruth’) is Masonic history. On February 15, 1785, the members of thePhilalethes, with Savalette de Langes at their head, met in Paris to discussquestions of importance regarding Freemasonry, such as its origin, essentialnature, relations with the occult sciences, etc … among them being French andAustrian princes, councillors, financiers, barons, ambassadors, officers of thearmy, doctors, farmers, a general, and last but not least two professors ofmagic. M. de Langes was a royal banker, who had been prominent in the oldIlluminati. A summons had been sent to Cagliostro to attend the convention, andhe had assured the messenger that he would take part in its deliberations. Buthe changed his mind and demanded that the Philalethes adopt the constitutions ofthe Egyptian Rite, burn their archives, and be initiated into the Mother Lodgeat Lyons [‘Triumphant Wisdom’], intimating that they were not in possession ofthe true Masonry. He deigned, as he said, to extend his hand over them, andconsented ‘to send a ray of light into the darkness of their temple.’ The Baronvon Gleichen was deputed to see Cagliostro and ask for more detailedinformation, and at the same time to request the presence of the members of theMother Lodge at the convention. Renewed correspondence took place, butCagliostro would not recede from his position. Finally three delegates from thePhilalethes, among them the Marquis de Marnésia of French le-Comte, repaired toLyons, and were initiated into Egyptian Masonry. In their report to theconvention occur the following significant words: ‘His [Cagliostro's] doctrineought to be regarded as sublime and pure; and without having a perfectacquaintance with our language, he employs it as did the prophets of old …’28[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1447]Could any of this ‘Egyptian’ hype have influenced Talleyrand in any way when helater began to push the idea of an ‘Egyptian expedition’ to Napoleon? It seemsplausible, particularly since there were existing precedents for a Frenchinvasion of Egypt.In 1249, five years after his army had captured the Cathar stronghold atMontségur, King Louis IX landing at the port of Damietta with a force of Frenchknights and attempted to win control of Egypt. The king was defeated andcaptured by the Arabs at Mansoura, a small town on the road to Cairo, but waseventually ransomed for a huge sum. Undeterred Louis IX was to organize a secondattempt to seize Egypt in 1270, this time approaching across the desert from alanding-point in Tunisia. But terrible diseases afflicted the French invadersand the king himself died on the desert trek.A few centuries later, in 1672, the famous mathematician and philosopher,Gottfried Leibniz, presented Louis XIV with a secret plan for a full-scaleinvasion of Egypt.29 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1448] Louis XIVwas then at war with Holland and ultimately turned down the plan – the realobject of which may have been to divert his attention from European conquests bygetting him to focus instead on a ‘universal mission’ to unite East and West inthe style of Alexander the Great.Scholars suspect Leibniz to have been a member of the ‘invisible’ brotherhood ofthe Rosicrucians.30 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1449] It is alsoknown that he was for a long while in contact with the Jesuit andHermetic-Cabalist, Athanasius Kircher, with whom he shared an interest inEgyptian hieroglyphs and obelisks.31[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1450] Kircher appears to haveinfluenced Leibniz in his mathematical and philosophical research and especiallyin his studies of ancient languages which in due course would become a personalobsession.32 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1451]The idea of an invasion of Egypt still did not go away. Other similar plans werelater proposed by the Duke of Choiseul, minister of foreign affairs under LouisXV.33 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1452] Choiseul was among the veryfirst of the high aristocrats of France to become a Freemason.34[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1453] He was also a bitter enemy of theJesuits whom he eventually managed to have banned from France in 1764. His wife,the Duchess of Choiseul, was a regular participant in the adoption lodge ‘Isis’that Cagliostro had opened at Paris in 1785, and had even been nominated as thelodge's Grand Mistress at one stage.35[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1454] Being the man responsible for themodernization of the French fleet, Choiseul was the authority on any navalinvasion France cared to consider. But his project, too, was eventually shelved.So when Talleyrand put forward his plan for the invasion of Egypt in early 1798,it was at first received with some hesitation. On the one hand Napoleon was waryof crossing the Mediterranean at a time when the British fleet under HoratioNelson was actively seeking French prey. On the other hand the prospect of aglorious, and seemingly easy victory evoking the exploits of Alexander andCaesar was extremely tempting and Napoleon found it difficult to ignore.Intelligence reports had shown that the port of Alexandria was manned by a smalland poorly-trained Arab garrison that was hardly a match for modern Frenchbattleships and Napoleon's elite troops.TROUBLE WITH JOSÉPHINEThere were painful personal considerations bearing down on Napoleon when he tookthe decision to invade Egypt. These involved his wife, Joséphine. The couple hadbeen married for barely two years and already Joséphine had been unfaithful witha young officer called Hippolyte Charles. Indeed a few months after theirwedding in 1796 Napoleon – then away waging war in Italy – seems to have sensedthat something was wrong with Joséphine's behavior and was prompted to write herthis rather immature letter:I write you, my beloved one, very often, and you write very little. You arewicked and naughty, very naughty, as much as you are fickle. It is unfaithful soto deceive a poor husband, a tender lover! Ought he to lose all his enjoymentsbecause he is so far away, borne down with toil, fatigue, and hardship? Withouthis Joséphine, without the assurance of her love, what is left him upon earth?What can he do? … Adieu, adorable Joséphine; one of these nights your door willopen with a great noise, as a jealous person, and you will find me in your arms.A thousand loving kisses.36 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1455]In November 1796, Joséphine made a trip to Genoa with Hippolyte Charles, whichprovoked anger and emotional confusion in Napoleon. Although he now stronglysuspected his wife of infidelity, his huge pride and obsessive love caused himto react paradoxically:I do not love you anymore! On the contrary, I detest you. You are a vile, mean,beastly slut. You don't write to me at all. You don't love your husband … Soon Iwill be holding you in my arms, then I will cover you with a million kisses,burning like the equator …37 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1456]On 5 March 1798, amidst eloquent orations evoking France's ‘universal mission’and the alleged need to thwart British trade with India, the Directory voted infavour of a military expedition to Egypt to be headed by Napoleon. The vote waskept secret until the fleet actually set sail from Toulon on 19 May 1798.38[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1457] According to British historianAubrey Noakes, Napoleon had wanted Joséphine to come along, probably to keep heraway from mischief in Paris, but she had stubbornly refused.39[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1458] But Vincent Cronin, in hisbiography of Napoleon, says the opposite, that it was Joséphine who desperatelywanted to go to Egypt but that it was Napoleon who refused her.40[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1459] Either way the result was thatJoséphine stayed behind with strict orders from Napoleon not to see HippolyteCharles ever again. Apparently a rather odd exchange of words took place betweenNapoleon and Joséphine as he prepared to board the flagship, l’Orient, bound forEgypt:‘When will you return?’ She murmured. ‘Six months, six years, perhaps never.’ Bonaparte replied indifferently. As theboat pushed off from the quay, Joséphine stepped forward with one last message:‘Good bye, Good bye! If you go to Thebes [Luxor], do send me a little obelisk…’41 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1460]And so, in this tense emotional mood, Napoleon set out for Egypt on his epicadventure of discovery and glory. In spite of Joséphine's disloyalty andfrivolity, he was still madly in love with her, and fervently believed in theirhistorical destiny together. Now, perhaps more than ever, he must have wanted toimpress on her his heroism and unique sense of mission.‘WE WHO HAVE DESTROYED THE POPE …’When the French fleet reached Alexandria on 1 July 1798, an excited Napoleonissued a rather curious proclamation to the Egyptian people, who were under thesupposedly oppressive rule of the Mameluks:42[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1461]People of Egypt! You will be told that I come to destroy your religion. Do notbelieve it. Reply that I come to restore your rights and punish the usurpers,and that I venerate more than the Mameluks, Allah, his Prophet and the Koran …There formerly existed in Egypt great cities, great canals, great commerce; bywhat means have they all been destroyed if not by the avarice, the injustice,and the tyranny of the Mameluks? … Sheikhs! Imams! Go tell the people that weare the friends of true Muslims. Is it not we who have destroyed the Pope whopreached that war must be made on Muslims? Is it not we who have destroyed theKnights of Malta because these madmen believed that God willed them to make waron Muslims? Is it not we who have been long friends with the Sultan and theenemies of his enemies? …43 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1462]There is a very revealing color etching by the Parisian printer A. H. Bassetdating from that time which shows what Napoleon might have had in mind.44[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1463] In the top register Napoleon isseen in the center of the scene standing next to the pyramids of Giza andreceiving the key of Egypt from two Arabs kneeling at his feet. Above Napoleonare two angels holding a wreath-crown; one angel represents ‘Glory’ and theother ‘Renown’. In the lower register Napoleon is shown pointing to a largeglowing triangle (the Supreme Being) hovering next to him, and seems to beinviting representatives of all the known religions to venerate the universal‘God’ symbolized by the glowing triangle.After Napoleon's capture of Cairo in late July 1798, the Arabs played along withhis offer of a covenant between the new French Republic and Islam, all the whilesecretly hating him and his troops as much as they had hated the crusaders ofbygone days. But it was a case of bargaining now with the devil until a way wasfound to throw him out. Meanwhile it must have been at about this time thatGeneral Jean-Andoche Junot, through a personal letter he had received fromParis, brought Napoleon irrefutable evidence that Joséphine had been seenstaying at an inn with Hippolyte Charles immediately after he had left her inToulon. Napoleon was devastated. In retaliation he began an open affair in Cairowith Pauline Fourès, the pretty wife of a young officer.45[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1464]The folie égyptienne, as historians would later call Napoleon's Egyptiancampaign, was to cost France dearly: the complete destruction of the Frenchinvasion fleet at Abu Qir by the British under Nelson, and the loss of nearly 40per cent of the expeditionary army which, at the outset, had totaled some 54,000men. Worse still was the humiliating surrender of the survivors to the Britishforces under Ralph Abercromby at Alexandria.Napoleon himself returned to France long before the surrender and somehowmanaged to survive this military and political disaster. Soon enough aneffective propaganda campaign began to convert the reality of the defeat intothe perception of a cultural victory.THE SAVANTS AND THE DESTINY OF NAPOLEONNapoleon had taken along to Egypt 167 ‘savants’ – scholars and the erudite frommany different disciplines – amongst them surveyors, mathematicians,astronomers, engineers, botanists, linguists, poets, artists and architects, allhand-picked from the newly formed Institut National de France. It had been themathematician Gaspard Monge who had personally recruited them. Monge was one ofNapoleon's closest friends and advisors, and considered the young general as his‘adopted son.’46 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1465] The reader willrecall that Monge was a prominent Freemason from the Nine Sisters lodge in Parisand had been directly responsible with Charles-Gilbert Romme for theintroduction of the Republican calendar modeled on the Egyptian solar year.While in Egypt, Monge founded the Institut d’Égypte in Cairo, a scientific andEncyclopédist body modeled on its French counterpart, the Institut National.Monge acted as president of the Institut d’Égypte with Napoleon acting as hisvice-president.47 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1466] Many of theother savants and officers who accompanied Napoleon to Egypt were alsoFreemasons, notably his right hand man, General Jean-Baptiste Kléber, who issaid to have founded the first modern Masonic lodge on Egyptian soil.48[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1467]Also among the savants was Dominique-Vivant Denon, an artist with an incredibletalent for freehand sketching and the making of etchings. A highly educated man,Denon had been a diplomat in Russia and Sweden before the Revolution. He hadbeen about to face the guillotine in December 1793 for his alleged royalistsympathies when he had been rescued from the blade by his friend, the painterJacques-Louis David. A prominent member of the National Convention, David, hadmasterminded the celebrations of ‘Isis of the Bastille’ and in December 1793 wasbusy promoting the Cult of the Supreme Being with Robespierre.Denon, who was talented, sophisticated and very handsome, was a favourite withthe ladies of the aristocracy. He was highly admired by Catherine II of Russiaand had no difficulty in winning the favour of the up-and-coming Joséphine whointroduced him to Napoleon. Joséphine urged Napoleon to take Denon to Egypt, butas the latter was not a member of the Institut National, Napoleon had at firstresisted the idea. Eventually, however, as was often the case, he yielded toJoséphine's demands. It was a decision he would not regret, for it was Denon,through the publication of his spectacular drawings, who would find the magic totransform Napoleon's Egyptian fiasco into a cultural victory for him in personand for the French Republic as a whole.Albeit tarnished a little by the defeat at Abu Qir and the humiliating surrenderof the expeditionary army at Alexandria, Napoleon's ‘conquest’ of Egypt, allowedhim to stand alongside history's most illustrious military heroes and empirebuilders: Alexander the Great and Augustus Caesar. And now here, in flesh andblood, was France's own Napoleon the Great. He had ‘returned from Egypt’ likesome mythical solar hero ready to found a new French Empire modeled on theempire of Charlemagne. The famous Description de l’Égypte, which was publishedunder the supervision of Denon, was dedicated to ‘Napoleon le Grand’, who isdepicted on the frontcover as an Apollo-Sol Invictus, hero-king. There he maystill be seen, riding the solar chariot under the protection of the Egyptiansymbol of the winged solar disc – into which, in this case, has been placed astar.Is it an accident that at about the same time, but on the other side of theAtlantic, the same symbolic representation of Apollo-Sol Invictus – includingthe same solar chariot and the same winged solar disk with the same star – wouldbe used in connection with George Washington? We will return to this mystery inthe next chapter.Few historians would disagree that the driving force behind Napoleon's militaryconquests was his unshakable belief in his own destiny – the belief that he hadsomehow been chosen by history to unite all Europe, and perhaps even the wholeworld, under one, universal rule. Since his vision for this rule was based onFrench republican ideals, virtues and laws, Napoleon, by his own reckoning, hadbecome the embodiment of the Revolution and its universal, almost sacred‘mission’.After his return from Egypt in 1799 and now barely 30 years of age, Napoleon hadthe Directory proclaim him ‘first consul’ of the Republic, a term clearly drawnfrom republican Rome. In 1802 he was voted consul for life and soon, with hislarge and well-trained armies, he had annexed to France vast territories inEurope that included Germany, Austria and Italy. He was, by then ‘emperor’ ofEurope in everything but title.Then in 1804, now 35 years of age, Napoleon went for the ultimate prize.THE HOLY ‘FRENCH’ EMPIREOn Christmas Day AD 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish general, Charlemagne,as first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Charlemagne was in Rome with a largearmy to ‘protect’ the pope but the legend has it that he had merely entered theBasilica of St. Peter to take part in the Mass. When he approached the altar andkneeled to pray, the pope placed a golden crown on his head and caused thecongregation to cry out:Life and victory to Charles the August, crowned by God, the great and pacificEmperor of the Romans!49 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1468]It is said that the pope even prostrated himself before Charlemagne and paid himhomage in the manner once accorded to ancient Roman emperors, which alsoincluded anointing him with sacred oil.After Charlemagne's ‘coronation’, no other emperor or king had ever again beengiven the great honour of being physically crowned by a pope. A thousand yearslater, however, Napoleon Bonaparte decided it was high time to change allthat.50 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1469] To this end he had PopePius VII forcefully brought to Paris in late 1804. The coronation, meticulouslyplanned by Napoleon himself, took place in the Cathedral of Notre Dame which,until very recently, had served as the ‘Temple of the goddess Reason’. Justbefore the climax of the event, Napoleon stepped forward, took the crown awayfrom the pope's hands and, in a grand symbolic gesture, crowned himself emperor.Under the bemused gaze of the pope, Napoleon then took a smaller crown andplaced it on the head of the lovely and promiscuous Joséphine, making herempress.51 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1470] David was toimmortalize this moment in an appropriately huge painting that may be viewedtoday in the Louvre. Also marking the occasion, the sculptor Jean-AntoineHoudon, a Freemason, a member of the Nine Sisters lodge, and formerly a closefriend of Cagliostro, made a marble bust of Joséphine.52[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1471]We may perhaps wonder if French artists such as Houdon, Denon and David were notsomewhat bedazzled by Joséphine – who they went on to promote as the new Isisand thus the new tutelary goddess of continental Freemasonry and of the city ofParis.The reader will recall that in 1773, Court de Gébelin, Freemason, memberof the Nine Sisters lodge and inventor of the modern Tarot, had written:No one ignores that Paris was originally enclosed in the island [the Île de laCité]. It was thus, since its origins, a city of navigation … As it was in ariver rife with navigation, it took as its symbol a boat, and as tutelarygoddess, Isis, goddess of navigation; and this boat was the actual one of Isis,symbol of this goddess.53 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1472]The association with the ‘Parisian’ boat of Isis and the notion of ‘empire’ isexplained by the early 19th century Parisian historian, François Noël:The boat of Isis, a feast which was celebrated in Rome with great pomp, wasknown as Navigium Isidis; after it had been launched in the water, it wasbrought back to the Temple of Isis and prayers were made for the prosperity ofthe Emperor, for the Empire and for the Roman people …54[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1473]DATES AND WORDSIn the brief period of Napoleon's occupation of Egypt, from 1798 to 1801, therewere witnessed some events that gave a mythical sparkle to this otherwise doomedadventure.First there is the matter of the date – 5 March 1798 – on which the Directoryvoted in favour of sending Napoleon to ‘liberate’ Egypt. Given the intenseMasonic and Isiaic interests of some of the protagonists, it would be unusual ifno one had realised that 5 March was the Feast of the ‘Boat of Isis’, theNavigium Isidis, widely popular during the Roman Empire and subsequently inancient France (Gaul).Second there are the confusing circumstances surrounding the naval Battle of AbuQir, the shallow bay to the east of Alexandria where Nelson obliteratedNapoleon's fleet on 1 August 1798. Abu Qir was the site of the ancient city ofCanopus where legend has it that the ship carrying the Trojan lovers, Paris andHelen, long ago took refuge. Helen, as we recall from Chapter Ten, had beenassociated by Herodotus with an Egyptian deity who he called ‘Aphrodite theStranger’. The Alexandrians identified Aphrodite with Isis, and both Helen andIsis were well known to be protectors of mariners and ships. Moreover, the starof Isis – Sirius – was the Stella Maris, the ‘Star of the Sea’, also known asthe ‘Star of the East’ or ‘Star of the Orient’. Surely Napoleon and his eruditefriends in Egypt would have been aware how highly evocative of all thesemythical archetypes was the act of anchoring the flagship l’Orient at AbuQir-Canopus?We concede at once that the question is highly speculative, but Napoleon'smindset at the time does not exclude such links being made. Of Corsican origins,he remained all his life a very superstitious man, and considered Joséphine tobe his ‘lucky charm’, a sort of human talisman. His extremely superstitiousnature meant that he was always on the lookout for omens. French historian JeanDuché reports an occasion when Napoleon, having been openly criticized by acardinal about his military campaigns, grabbed the cardinal by the sleeve,dragged him to a window, and, in broad daylight, asked him if he could see ‘thestar’. When the baffled cardinal retorted that there was no ‘star’ to be seen,Napoleon replied:Well, as long as I shall be the only one to see it, then I will follow my owndestiny and will not permit anyone to criticize me!55[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1474]To any French Freemason the word ‘Orient’ in the name of Napoleon's flagshipwould inevitably be reminiscent of the ‘Mother Lodge’ in Paris known as theGrand Orient i.e. the ‘Great East’. In Masonic jargon to this day the word‘Orient’ or ‘East’ denotes the name/place of the main Masonic temple in any townor city, and the term ‘Grand Orient’ or ‘Great East’ denotes the mother templeor lodge in a country.56 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1475] Forexample, the Grand Orient denotes the main Masonic Temple of Paris in the RueCadet; likewise the ‘Great East’ denotes Freemasons’ Hall of London.MASONIC EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH?There are no primary source documents that prove Napoleon was a Freemason; norare there any that disprove this proposition. There has, however, been muchlearned speculation on both sides, with some scholars arguing vehemently that hewas an initiated Mason57 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1476] and somearguing equally vehemently that he was not.58[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1477]Many continental Freemasons in the 19th century certainly acted as thoughNapoleon was a member of the brotherhood. There were dozens of Masonic lodges inEurope that bore his name such as the Saint Napoleon lodge in Paris, theNapoleomagne lodge in Toulouse, the Napoleone lodge in Florence, LaConstellation Napoleon in Naples, the Étoile Napoleon in Madrid and so on – withlodges usually choosing names that evoked Napoleon's military, social andcultural achievements.59 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1478]We know for sure that Napoleon's strategic entourage was filled with prominentFreemasons such as Talleyrand, Gaspard Monge, Jean Baptiste Kléber, AndréMasséna and others. We know too that most members of Napoleon's family wereFreemasons, including his own father, Charles Bonaparte, his brothers Jérôme,Louis, and Joseph, his wife, Joséphine and his brother-in-law, Joachim Murat.60[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1479] Historian and Masonic author,François Collaveri, asserts with confidence that:… the initiation of Napoleon is not a legend; he was initiated into Freemasonryprobably in Egypt as is expressly claimed by the Grand Orient of France.61[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1480]Other authorities go as far as to argue that Napoleon, as well as his general,Jean-Baptiste Kléber, underwent their Egyptian Masonic initiation inside theGreat Pyramid of Giza at the hands of a Coptic sage.62[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1481]Kléber, the son of an operative Mason, had practiced architecture in Paris longbefore joining Napoleon's army. In 1787, two years before the French Revolution,he had designed an Egyptian-style temple for the Parc d’Études in Paris.63[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1482] Few had any direct acquaintancewith ancient Egyptian temples at that time and Kléber's design bears littleresemblance to any of the existing ancient temples in Egypt – though from thedécor that he also designed it is likely that he had a ‘Temple of Isis’ in mind.According to historian Paul Naudon, Kléber founded Egypt's first modern Masoniclodge which he predictably named La Loge Isis.64[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1483] In June 1800, however, two yearsafter arriving in Egypt, he was murdered by an Arab fanatic. Kléber's corpse wasembalmed and shipped back to France. When the coffin arrived in Paris in lateSeptember, Denon made plans for the construction of a replica of the EgyptianTemple of Dendera to be raised at the Place des Victoires in Paris as amausoleum for the great general.65[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1484]NAPOLEON RESEARCHES ISISAfter his return from Egypt Napoleon was to develop a rather curious fascinationwith the goddess Isis. Indeed so strong was his interest that he eventually setup a special commission, headed by the scholar Louis Petit-Radelin, to confirmthe ancient legend (reported by Corrozet, Dupuis and others) that Isis was thetrue and ancient tutelary deity of the city of Paris. Napoleon apparentlyexpressed a specific interest in the so-called boat of Isis and its allegedconnection with the ‘Boat of Paris’ found in the coat-of-arms of the city.66[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1485] After a year or so of researchinto this matter, the special commission was able to report to Napoleon thatthere was, in fact, much evidence to support the claim that the boat of Isiswas, indeed, the very same as the Boat of Paris.67[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1486] Highly impressed by thesefindings, Napoleon issued instructions on 20 January 1811 that a figure of theEgyptian goddess and her ‘star’ should now be included on the coat-of-arms ofParis:We have previously authorised and do also authorise now by these present signeddocuments by our hand, that our good city of Paris will bear the coat-of-arms asshown and coloured on the attached drawing, at the front of the ancient ship,the prow loaded with a statue of Isis, seated, in silver on a sea of the same,and lead by a star also of silver.68[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1487]The drawing that was attached to Napoleon's letter is today kept in theBibliothèque Nationale de France.69[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1488] On this drawing can be seen thered, gold and silver coat-of-arms surrounded by a wreath of wheat. The whole issurmounted by a golden crown on which is perched the imperial eagle. The crownis transpierced by the Hermetic caduceus, the entwined winged-snakes. The mainimage is the silver boat floating on a silver sea. On its prow is the goddessIsis seated on a throne and guided by a five-pointed star hovering in front ofthe boat. Above the boat are three golden bees, symbolizing divine solar rule.Interestingly, the same group of symbols also turns up in the Description del’Égypte published by Denon – on the dedication of which Napoleon's name,denoted by the letter ‘N’, is seen surrounded by the Hermetic coiled snakesurmounted by a crown and placed next to a pharaonic cartouche inside which isdrawn a bee and a five-pointed star.Napoleon appointed Denon as first director of the newly opened Musée Napoléonhoused at the Louvre. At the same time he commissioned the architects CharlesPercier and Pierre François Léonard Fontaine to design the Cour Carrée on theeast side of the Louvre, and the artist Jean-Guillaume Moitte to decorate theeastern façade of the inner gateway. Moitte chose to have the most famouslawgivers of history, Moses and Numa, flank a statue of the goddess Isis seatedon a throne. Next to Isis can be seen the legendary Inca solar emperor andlawmaker Manco Cápac.70 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1489]Three decades later, when Napoleon's body was repatriated from his place ofexile in St. Helena and placed in the mausoleum at Les Invalides in Paris, therenowned sculptor and architect Louis-Tullis Visconti designed the finaldecorations on the circular walls surrounding the former emperor's largesarcophagus. In one of the scenes Visconti sculpted a representation of Napoleonas a solar god-king much resembling Manco Cápac and Sol Invictus, showing therevered French general seated on a throne, barechested and with the solar raysshooting out of his head, his arm outstretched handing the ‘law’ to the manynations of his empire …THE PLACE OF THE STARThe most famous monument of Paris, one that was commissioned by Napoleon himselfin 1806, is, of course, the Arc de Triomphe at the western end of theChamps-Élysées.71 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1490] The name of thelocation must have had a special resonance for Napoleon, for so long as anyonecould remember it had been called L’Étoile, the ‘Star’. Given his obsession withhis own ‘star of destiny’ and his obvious interest in the connection betweenIsis and the city of Paris, it is not impossible that the ‘star’ in question wasimagined by Napoleon to be Sirius. There is, moreover, a rather unusualdepiction on the Arc de Triomphe that is highly implicit of Isis and herconnection to Napoleon. On the east face of the monument is the commonly called‘Triumph of Napoleon’ sculpted by the artist Jean-Pierre Cortot in 1833.72[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1491] The scene shows ‘Victory’ (anaked woman) crowning Napoleon (who is wearing the toga of a Roman emperor) witha laurel wreath. A Roman goddess wearing a ‘tower’ on her head (supposedlysymbolising a town surrendering to Napoleon) is seen kneeling at the emperor'sfeet.The kneeling goddess is, in fact, Cybele, and had clearly been modelled byCortot from the figure of a Roman goddess wearing a ‘tower’ on her head found inParis in 1675 when the foundations of the church of Saint-Eustache were beingexcavated.73 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1492] According to Claudedu Molinet, the bishop of St. Genevieve who published the find in 1683, thiseffigy was:The one that the Greeks called Io and the Egyptians called Isis, and is the sameas the one the Romans honored under the same of Cybele, being the Earth orNature that the Egyptians married to Osiris who was the Sun, in order to make itfertile and mother of all productions that form within her breasts …74[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1493]Thus in the minds of French historians of the 17th century, the goddess with thetower headdress was none other than a representation of Isis, for the latter,too ‘had also a tower on her head’75[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1494] (as indeed she does in ancientEgyptian hieroglyphs, although what looks like a ‘tower’ is, in fact, a throne).In addition it would not be too farfetched to equate the kneeling figure on theArc de Triomphe with the Empress Joséphine wearing the ‘crown of Isis’ in Paris– for this scene brings sharply to mind the famous painting by David of thecoronation of Joséphine and Napoleon in December 1804 sanctioned by the presenceof the pope.76 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1495] In the paintingNapoleon is shown wearing the laurel-wreath of Roman emperors while Joséphine isseen kneeling at his feet, herself wearing the empress's crown. The same sceneis depicted on the Arc de Triomphe, where Napoleon is again garbed as a Romanemperor and crowned with laurel while Isis-Cybele kneels at his feet, herselfwearing the crown-tower of the goddess.We saw in Chapter Sixteen how the main axis of Paris (running through themonumental avenue of the Champs-Élysées) was aligned by Le Nôtre, either bycoincidence or by deliberation, 26° north-of-west towards the sunset on tworeligiously important days of the year (8 May and 6 August) and, also lookingback, 26° south-of-east towards the cosmic rising of the star Sirius. We alsosaw that this arrangement correlates with the main axis of the great solartemple complex of Karnak-Luxor which is likewise directed 26° north-of-westtowards the sunset and, looking back, 26° south-of-east towards the heliacal(dawn) rising of Sirius at the beginning of Egypt's civilization. We know thatSirius was the herald of the ‘birth’ of solar kings. And we've seen how Napoleonendowed the city of Paris with a new coat-of-arms blatantly displaying thegoddess Isis and her star Sirius, and how he also commissioned a huge arch to beraised at the ‘place of the star’ right on the centerline of the axis of Paris.All these interlocking themes, when considered together, become even moreintriguing when we add to them one further fact of history. In 1831, just asNapoleon's Arc de Triomphe was being completed, there was also brought to Parisan ancient Egyptian obelisk – the obelisk of Ramses II as the reader willrecall, one of a pair that had originally stood outside the Temple of Luxor inUpper Egypt but now destined for a place of choice along the axis of Paris.HOW FRANCE HAD A SECOND REVOLUTIONThe year 1831 was special for the French, for it followed the country's secondgreat popular ‘revolution’, that of July 1830 when the restored monarchy underCharles X, a brother of Louis XVI, was toppled – never to return. This secondrevolution was engineered by France's and America's most famous Freemason, theMarquis de Lafayette, who personally masterminded the coup d’état that broughtthe ‘Citizen King’ Louis-Philippe d’Orléans, eldest son of Philippe Égalité,into power.To French Freemasonry on both sides of the Atlantic it must have appeared as ifthe ‘Blazing Star’ or ‘Star of the Orient’ had finally risen over the horizon ofParis. Not surprisingly then, when the young Citizen King took charge of thecompletion of the Arc de Triomphe, it was proposed that the top of this monumentshould be decorated with a huge, golden five-pointed star.77[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1496]Let us see how the 1830 ‘Revolution’ came to be.After Napoleon's shattering defeat at Waterloo at the hands of the British on 18June 1815, the emperor ‘abdicated’ and was exiled for life to the island of St.Helena. France was left with a terrible sense of failure, shame and utterconfusion, and, in the chaos that followed, the people were coaxed to agree tothe unthinkable – the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.In 1814 the Count of Provence, the younger brother of Louis XVI, became thenewly restored king of France as Louis XVIII. Ironically, all was back to squareone for the Republicans and the Bonapartists. But there was really no choice inthis matter. A new Republic at that time would have been completely out of thequestion, let alone a ‘successor’ to Napoleon. It seemed to everyone that aconstitutional monarchy à l'anglaise (‘in the English manner’) was the onlyrealistic option. But the wellsprings of the Revolution were far from dry.Tensions quickly began to develop between those who wanted the French Revolutionto be an ongoing process and those others who wanted a return to the Old Regimeof totalitarian monarchy. A group of zealous royalists, known as the Ultras,started a political movement which became known as the ‘White Terror’. It aimedto eradicate all traces of the Revolution and to purge France of those who hadsupposedly ‘betrayed’ the monarchy before and after the fall of the Bastille.Although the king secretly sanctioned the Ultras, publicly, at least at first,he wanted to be seen as a moderate. To this end he took as his prime ministerthe famous industrialist Élie Decazes, bestowed on him the title of Duke, andrelied on the latter's high reputation as a reasonable and just man to win thesupport of the people. In this indirect manner Louis XVIII hoped to ride out thegrowing political storm that was brewing between Royalists and Republicans.Decazes was a prominent Freemason. In 1818, the year before he was appointedprime minister, he had become the Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the33rd Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. It is believed by someMasonic historians that even Louis XVIII was initiated into Freemasonry. Thisapparently was done in 1775 when he was still the Count of Provence. It is alsosaid that Louis XVIII’s brother, the Count of Artois (the future Charles X), wasa Freemason and that both belonged to the lodge Les Trois Frères.78[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1497]It seems that Louis XVIII naïvely supposed that Freemasonry in France was stillthat quaint club frequented by aristocrats and the high bourgeoisie that he hadknown before the Revolution. But, of course, he was much mistaken. At first,with the influence of Decazes at court, everyone had hoped that the king wouldslowly be swayed towards a British-style parliamentary monarchy. But any chanceof this happening was completely shattered on 13 February 1821 when a Republicanfanatic, Louis Pierre Louvel, shot dead the young Duke of Berry, CharlesFerdinand d’Artois, who was the king's nephew.The Duke of Berry had been the only hope of keeping the Bourbon dynasty goingindefinitely, for it was well known that Louis XVIII had no children and thathis brother was well past the age of producing more.79[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1498] The assassin and, morespecifically, those behind him, had figured that by eliminating the Duke ofBerry they would, in effect, cut off the Bourbon bloodline to the throne ofFrance. However, there was something that the assassins could not have knownwhich ended up foiling their ingenious plot. The Duke of Berry's wife, thebeautiful and intelligent Marie Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, was pregnant. A fewmonths later she bore a son, l'enfant miracle (the ‘miracle child’), who wasnamed Henry.The assassination of the Duke of Berry gave the Ultras the excuse they wanted tostart a witch-hunt against all anti-royalists. Louis XVIII now showed his truecolors by allowing the Ultras a free hand in the affair. Louis dismissed theprime minister, Élie Decazes, who was suspected of being a Republican andBonapartist. He was replaced by the Count of Villèle, a zealous royalist andUltra ringleader of the worst sort.Decazes's dismissal much alarmed the Republicans who now began to suspectstrongly that Louis XVIII was about to restore the Old Regime, and plots beganto be hatched against the king. Because Decazes and many of his supporters wereFreemasons, the Ultras suspected that the lodges were behind these plots.Ironically, many Freemasons including Decazes were actually loyal to the king,but it is equally true that Masonic lodges became the cover for secret politicalgatherings and, as was clearly the case during the 1789 Revolution, an idealbreeding ground for radicals working against the monarchy.By December 1821 members of an extremist secret society called the Charbonnerie(the ‘charcoal burners’), whose aim was to launch an armed rebellion against theking, began to infiltrate Masonic lodges in Paris. The Charbonnerie had directlinks to the Italian Carbonari, an ultra-radical, anti-clerical andanti-royalist group which, since the early 1820s, had been behind many armeduprisings against the joint papal and Austrian-Habsburg regime in Italy.Much like the Freemasons, the Carbonari selected their members and hadinitiation ceremonies. These took place not in lodges but in ventes, an Italianword that means ‘twenty’; each was limited to 20 members so as not to attractthe attention of the police. The Carbonari's origins can be traced to the year1812, and they were almost certainly a militant offshoot of the Masonic GrandeOriente d’Italia which, at that time, was headed by Joachim Murat, the king ofNaples and brother-in-law of Napoleon.80[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1499] Indeed, Italian Freemasonry hadflourished after the Napoleonic conquest of Italy, and by 1820 the Carbonari andthe Freemasons in Italy formed a huge network of lodges and ventes that providedideal meeting grounds as well as an effective system of secret communication forradical political groups plotting to liberate Italy from the detested Austrians.The Carbonari, who symbolized the driving force behind Italy's independencemovement, certainly did not hide the fact that they were staunch Bonapartistsand, as such, opponents of all monarchies as well as enemies of the CatholicChurch. In September 1821, after the death of Napoleon, they took to the streetscausing serious unrest which forced Pope Pius VII to condemn them as well asFreemasons in general.81 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1500] The daysof burning at the stake were over, but in 1821 the Austrian police launched amassive operation in Italy to purge all radical elements from Masonic lodges andthe ventes of the Carbonari. There were hundreds of arrests and many Masons andCarbonari were imprisoned. Others were deported or escaped into France, wherethey quickly began to infiltrate the Masonic lodges.The 1822 Charbonnerie uprising in France immediately brought Masonic lodgesthere under intense scrutiny. To make things worse, it was also suspected by theUltras that the notorious Marquis de Lafayette was the leader of theCharbonnerie. Lafayette was seen on both sides of the Atlantic as a greatrepublican hero, and his reputation had become almost legendary amongFreemasons. But even though Lafayette was staunch republican and also a veryactive Freemason, he was by no means a radical, and at heart almost certainlyhad favoured a constitutional monarchy rather than the chaotic ‘Republic’ he hadwitnessed first-hand in France after the 1789 Revolution. At any rate, whetherLafayette was sympathetic to the Charbonnerie or not became an academic issue,for the Charbonnerie was very poorly organized in France and heavily infiltratedby royalist spies. It was soon disbanded after the police arrested theCharbonnerie plotters en masse and also many Freemasons in the confusion thatfollowed.A series of death sentences were immediately passed. Among those executed werethe famous ‘four sergeants of La Rochelle’, two of whom were found to beFreemasons belonging to the Egyptian Rite of Memphis-Misraim . According to theMasonic author Jean-André Faucher, the insurrection of 1821 – 22 was, indeed,largely blamed on the new Masonic Rite of Memphis and also the Rite of Misraim,both of which were believed to have originated in Italy in the early 1800s.82[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1501] To make matters worse, ÉlieDecazes, the ex-prime minister, had become a member of the Rite of Misraim, aswell as many other notable figures on the other side of the Channel in Englandwho supported Decazes, such as the Duke of Leicester and the Duke of Sussex.83[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1502]In that troubled year of 1822 there were no less than 22 Misraim lodges in Parisplus about a dozen more elsewhere in France, mostly in Lyons and Metz. Thepseudo-Egyptian character of the rites that were practiced in those lodges isevident in lodge names. For example there was one in Metz called HeliopolisReborn, another in Lyons called Memphis, and yet another in Montauban called TheFlooding Nile.84 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1503]THE SECOND REVOLUTIONIt was the Rite of Misraim which, in 1822, was principally accused of harboringthe Carbonari. In consequence it was banned in 1823. In the midst of theseconfusing and turbulent events Louis XVIII died in September 1824 leaving nooffspring to take his place. He was succeeded by his brother, the Count ofArtois, crowned as Charles X, who was now approaching his 70th year.Like most aristocrats who had fled the 1789 Revolution, Charles had lived inexile until 1814, and this bitter and humiliating experience made him determinedto restore the Old Regime with the divine right of kingship and also the fullauthority of the Catholic Church. At his coronation, Charles insisted that heshould be anointed in accordance with the ancient rituals of kingship at ReimsCathedral with the few drops of sacred oil that had been saved when the SaintAmpoule had been smashed during the Reign of Terror of 1793 – 4.Once crowned, Charles X became the leader of the Ultras and the Catholic revivalbegan to gather pace, causing outrage among those who had supported theRevolution. Many anti-clericals as well as Republicans now joined Masonic lodgesnot for spiritual enlightenment but for political shelter. Charles X, who was adevout Catholic himself, began to revive the dreaded ‘Society of Jesus’, theJesuits, and soon it was rumored that he had joined the order and might handover power to them.Political unrest reached boiling point in March 1830, when, in a naïve move toappease his critics, the king dissolved the Chambre des Députés and called ageneral election which he hoped the Ultras would win. The vote, however, wentagainst the Ultras and Charles X now confronted two unsavory options: he couldeither agree to a constitutional monarchy or scoop the power already in hishands with a coup d’état by eradicating the Bonapartists and Republicans in hisgovernment. He unwisely opted for the latter, and by July 1830 the barricadeswere up again in the streets of Paris.For the second time in less than 50 years a revolution had been unleashedagainst the Bourbon dynasty.LAFAYETTE SEIZES THE DAYNot unexpectedly, two factions quickly emerged, one made up of pure Republicansthe other up of Constitutional Monarchists. Lafayette, that eternal compromiser,at first swayed between the two, even though the Republicans considered himtheir leader. In his view, however, the best option now was to oust the Bourbonsaltogether and replace them with a new monarchy who would ‘constitutionalise’the Old Regime. He had in mind a young prince, the Duke of Orléans, whosefather, Philippe Égalité, had sponsored the 1789 Revolution with his immensewealth and position – for which it eventually beheaded him!Although Lafayette had been at odds with Philippe Égalité during the 1789Revolution, he was now in very close contact with his son, Louis-Philipped’Orléans. Lafayette's plan had the distinct advantage of offering a solutionthat might be acceptable to both the Republicans and the ConstitutionalMonarchists, and thus avoid the real risk of a civil war. It remained now topersuade the Republicans, the Bonapartists and, especially, the generalpopulation of Paris, that Louis-Philippe d’Orléans was the right man for thejob. This, Lafayette achieved with the well-judged use of powerful symbolism – atechnique that had so often worked with the rowdy Parisian mob.In August 1830 Charles X was forced to abdicate. In a desperate bid to keep theBourbon dynasty on the throne of France, he asked that his grandson, the‘miracle child’ of the Duchess of Berry, be accepted as the new king. But boththe Republicans and the Constitutional Monarchists rejected the proposaloutright. This was the moment when Lafayette and his own candidate,Louis-Philippe d’Orléans, made their move. After three days of bloody streetfighting in Paris, the crowds gathered at the Hôtel de Ville and, in a perfectlytimed propaganda coup that only high initiates would know how to bring about,Lafayette grabbed a tricolor flag of the Revolution and wrapped it aroundLouis-Philippe d’Orléans, proclaiming him the ‘Citizen King’ of France.Amazingly, the theatrical gesture worked. The Parisian mob cheered andLouis-Philippe won the day. The hard-line Republicans and Bonapartists werefurious at having their ‘revolution’ snatched away from them by such trickery,but there was not much they could do.Almost immediately King Louis-Philippe I began a series of projects supposed todemonstrate his love and support for Bonaparte and the Revolution. He orderedthat the Arc de Triomphe, the construction of which had begun in 1809 but hadbeen shelved ever since, should now be completed. He also ordered theconstruction of a huge pillar at the Place de la Bastille to commemorate the1830 Revolution; on top of the pillar, as the reader will recall from ChapterOne, was then placed the ‘Genie of Paris’, a winged youth much resembling theGreek Hermes.85 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1504]Also at about this time Louis-Philippe ordered that the obelisk brought from theTemple of Luxor in Egypt, and recently arrived in Paris, should now raised inthe Place de la Concorde …CHAMPOLLIONIn 1822, a year and a half after Napoleon's death, an amazing scientificdiscovery was made which would not only stun the academic world but would alsofulfill a promise that the emperor had made at St. Helena. For when asked why hehad invaded Egypt, Napoleon had calmly replied:I came to draw attention and bring back the interest of Europe to the center ofthe ancient world.86 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1505]This was a side of Napoleon that has often been neglected, namely that he wasnot only a military genius but also an accomplished scholar and a senior memberof the Institut National. It was Napoleon who had the great forethought oftaking the 167 savants to Egypt in 1798, and it was he who founded the firstmodern scientific institute in Egypt: the Institut d’Égypte in Cairo. It wastherefore appropriate that his grand dream of restoring cultural interest inancient Egypt was not fulfilled by a politician but rather by a quiet andstudious young man living in the little town of Figeac near Grenoble – a youngman who had never traveled out of France, let alone to Egypt.On 17 September 1822 Jean-François Champollion, coughing and speaking with theweak voice of someone suffering from serious pulmonary problems, announced to agroup of scholars at the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in Paristhat he had an important statement to make regarding the mysterious ancientEgyptian hieroglyphs. Feeling awkward in front of such an illustrious and veryskeptical congregation of learned men, Champollion slowly read a paper which hehad addressed to the chairman of the Académie Française, Monsieur Dacier, andwhich was simply titled Lettre à M. Dacier relative à l'alphabet deshiéroglyphes phonétiques.It was, in fact, a cultural and scientific bombshell on a scale rarelyexperienced in the world. For it became obvious to many of those listening toChampollion that day that the young man had solved the biggest mystery of thepast: he had cracked the code of the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic language.Indeed, Champollion's modest Lettre à M. Dacier was to mark the most prestigiousmoment of the Académie Française and provided the foundation stone upon whichscientific Egyptology would be developed. Many Freemasons present on that day inSeptember 1822 would also have thought it wonderful and most appropriate thatthis world-changing discovery had been announced in Paris, the city of Isis.In the 1820s the area of Grenoble and Lyons where the Champollions lived was notonly the haunt of Republicans and Bonapartists who opposed the monarchy, butalso the hotbed of many innovative Masonic movements, especially those relatedto the ‘Egyptian’ type of Freemasonry started at Lyons by Cagliostro.87[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1506] It is known that Champolion and,more especially, his older brother, Jacques-Joseph, were fervent Bonapartists,and so were most of their friends, many of whom were also Freemasons.88[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1507] The question must arise,therefore, whether Champolion himself was not a member of the brotherhood and,more specifically, a member of one of the Egyptian-style lodges? Today someMasonic historians list Champollion as a ‘famous Freemason’, but there is nodocumented proof of his involvement.89[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1508]Champollion and his brother, Jacques-Joseph, had at one time been held undersuspicion of political agitation and, in 1816, had even been placed under housearrest at Figeac. It is said that they gained the support of the influentialFreemason, Élie Decazes, then the minister of interior, who ordered theirrelease and allowed the two brothers to return to Grenoble in 1817.90[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1509]Decazes, as we shall recall, was to become Grand Commander of the SupremeCouncil of the 33rd Degree and one of the first notables to join the EgyptianMasonic Rite of Misraim.91 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1510] Lateralso the prominent statesman, the Duke of Blacas, became the patron andprotector of Champollion.92 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1511]Paradoxically, the Duke of Blacas was a staunch Ultra and a favourite of bothLouis XVIII and of Charles X. The duke had served as the French ambassador tothe kingdom of Naples since 1815, then the hotspot of ‘Egyptian’ MisraimFreemasonry. Let us also note that there had been curious exchanges betweenChampollion and certain well-known adepts of these neo-Egyptian Masonic groups.Champollion was a rival of Alexandre Lenoir, a staunch Freemason and once thesuperintendent of the king's buildings before the 1789 Revolution. Lenoir, whowas a keen adept of the Scottish Rite,93[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1512] and an ‘initiate of the cult ofIsis’,94 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1513] was also the publisherof La Nouvelle Explication des Hiéroglyphes in 1808. When Champollion began hisown work on the Egyptian hieroglyphs he had condescendingly called Lenoir unoison (‘a little goose’) and stated that he only respected the older man becausehe was ‘in the good books’ of Empress Joséphine.95[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1514] In 1814 Lenoir had published abook entitled La Franc-Maçonnerie rendue à sa véritable origine (‘Freemasonrybrought back to its true origins’), in which he linked the origins of thebrotherhood to the ‘cult of Isis’, which may explain why Lenoir, as Champollionhimself had dryly noted, was highly regarded by Joséphine.There is, too, Champollion's relationship with an Italian-Greek beauty fromLivorno, Angelica Palli, with whom Champollion had fallen desperately in loveduring a research trip to Italy in 1826. Livorno, which is on the Mediterraneancoast near Pisa, had been the principal port of the Medici of Florence who, aswe saw in Chapter Eight, played a great part in the Hermetic Renaissance.Angelica Palli, a poetess and writer, was very conversant with Hermetic andNeo-Platonic literature. Her evocative name (literally ‘angel of the temples’),must have much stirred the fertile imagination of Champollion, who was to writeof her to his friend, the Abbé Gazerra: ‘I thank the great Ammon-Ra for meetingher.’ She in return commented with delight on his ‘philosophy’ which she foundto be imbued with ‘Egyptian doctrines, fertile source from which drew Plato and… Pythagoras.’96 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1515]Many years later Angelica Palli became an active supporter of the famous Italianrevolutionary, Giuseppe Manzini, a staunch Freemason who was head of the ItalianSupreme Council of the 33rd Degree. Manzini was a close friend and colleague ofthe popular hero, Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was to become the first Grand Masterof the Egyptian Masonic Rite of Memphis-Misraim.97[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1516] There was, too, a curiousconnection between the city of Livorna, where Palli and Champollion had met, anda rather elusive Masonic society called the Société Secrète Égyptienne. It isthought that one of the founders of this society was Mathieu de Lesseps, fatherof the famous engineer, Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built the Suez Canal inEgypt.98 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1517] The story goes that in1818 the Austrian police raided a Masonic lodge in Venice. Amongst theconfiscated documents was one revealing the existence of the secret society andimplicating as one of its members no less a figure than Egypt's first modernruler, Khedive Muhammad Ali.99 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1518]Mathieu de Lesseps was a staunch Bonapartist and also a keen adept of theEgyptian Rite of Freemasonry.100 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1519]He was a very close friend of the khedive, and from 1803 to 1806 had beenFrance's commercial attaché in Egypt, after which he had served as French consulin the city of Livorna.101 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1520] Weshall encounter the de Lesseps family again in the next chapter in connectionwith the Statue of Liberty that stands in New York Harbor. Meanwhile, whetherall this had any influence or bearing on Champollion whilst he was in Livorno isnot clear, but it may explain his mindset as he began to plan there his firstand only trip to Egypt …‘IF YOU GO TO THEBES DO SEND ME A LITTLE OBELISK …’In Chapter One we saw that three years before his abdication in 1830, Charles Xhad commissioned the artist François-Édouard Picot to decorate the ceiling ofhis personal museum at the Louvre with an ancient Egyptian motif centred uponthe goddess Isis.102 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1521] The readerwill recall that Picot had been a student of the radical revolutionary andBonapartist Jacques-Louis David who, along with Robespierre, had mastermindedthe various celebrations in Paris of the goddess Reason and the Supreme Beingand, more especially, the celebrations at the Bastille in August 1793 when astatue of Isis was displayed to the Parisian crowds. Bearing this in mind, the‘Isis’ featuring on the large-format ceiling painting by Picot can be seenimmediately to have been modelled on David's statue of ‘Isis of the Bastille’.Indeed the painting itself contains independent confirmation of this connection– for seen flying above ‘Isis’, is the so-called Genie of the Arts, a nakedyouth with golden wings much resembling the Greek god Hermes. The ‘genie’ holdsa torch in one hand in order to illuminate the landscape below for the benefitof the ‘goddess Athena’, at whose feet can be seen an owl, the symbol of wisdomacquired through initiation.There is little doubt that the landscape beneath Isis in the painting is to beimagined not in Egypt but in Paris and, more precisely, at the Bastille – forthe give-away is the ‘genie’ which, today, can actually be seen ‘flying’ overthe Place de la Bastille. Where? It stands at the top of the huge pillar whichwas commissioned for the spot by the Citizen King Louis-Philippe I in 1830,three years after Picot completed the painting.And there is one other point. In Picot's painting the goddess Isis is gazing ata tall obelisk in the distance. Could this obelisk be the actual obelisk fromLuxor raised at the Place de la Concorde by Louis-Philippe I? Is the Picotpainting suggesting some sort of connection or link between the city of Parisand the city of Luxor?In 1828, a few months after Picot had completed the painting for Charles X, thelatter offered to sponsor Champollion to undertake a feasibility study forbringing an obelisk from Egypt to Paris. The obelisk in question had beendonated to France by Khedive Muhammad Ali.103[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1522] Charles X cultivated a keeninterest in ancient Egypt and, in 1828, had just inaugurated the Egyptianantiquities museum in the south wing of the Louvre.In July that year Champollion headed a small team of scientists and artists,including the French archaeologist Charles Lenormant and the architect AntoineBibent, and set sail from the port of Toulon towards Egypt. Champollion and his‘Argonauts’ as he called his team, reached Alexandria on 18 August 1828 where,barely three decades earlier, Bonaparte had landed with his troops. Champollionwas received by the French consul, Bernardino Drovetti, and a friendship quicklydeveloped between the two.Drovetti was from southern Italy, and since 1818 had also been the ‘Great Copt’of the Egyptian Masonic lodges in Alexandria.104[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1523] He had been appointed Frenchconsul in 1821, and had earlier served as assistant to Mathieu de Lesseps. Andlike de Lesseps before him, Drovetti had become a close friend of KhediveMuhammad Ali. This privileged connection gave Drovetti a rather free hand indealing with ancient Egyptian relics, and he soon amassed a huge personalfortune. His British counterpart and rival was Henry Salt, the British consul inAlexandria, who, along with Giovanni Battista Belzoni,105[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1524] the flamboyant Italian Freemasonand Egyptologist, also traded in antiquities which he sold to private collectorsand to the British Museum.Champollion was totally enchanted by Egypt. He was to write of this ancientcivilization:We in Europe are but Lilliputians, and no other ancient or modern people hasdeveloped the art of architecture on a scale so sublime, so huge, so grandioseas did the Egyptians … I repeat yet again … ancient Egypt taught the arts toGreece, the latter developed them into a more sublime form but without Egypt,Greece would probably not have become the home of the arts.106[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1525]So fascinated was Champollion with Egypt that he even entertained the notionthat he had been somehow physically connected to it since his birth: ‘It seemsto me that I was born here’, he wrote to his brother whom he had nicknamedAmmon, ‘and the Europeans here think I look very much like a Copte’.107[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1526]During his 18-month visit to Egypt, Champollion manage to get an agreement withMuhammad Ali that he would take to Paris one of the two obelisks that stoodoutside the Temple of Luxor. The khedive would have been quite happy to letChampollion take both obelisks, but it seemed that one was all that the Frenchengineers could cope with. The job of bringing the ancient monolith to Franceproved to be no easy task. As it weighed an estimated 230 metric tons and was 23meters tall, there was some question at first of slicing it into severalmanageable pieces, but Champollion would not have it, claiming that it would bea ‘sacrilege’.108 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1527]On his way back to France, Champollion made the acquaintance of a young navalengineer called Raymond de Verninac Saint-Maur who would later receive thecommand of the Luxor, the special ship that was built to carry the obelisk downthe Nile and across the Mediterranean. Verninac worked under the authority ofthe French minister of the navy, the Baron of Haussez, who much dislikedChampollion on account of a feud he had with him in Grenoble, when Haussez hadbeen the chief of police there. Not unexpectedly, Haussez pushed Champollionaside and took all the credit for securing the obelisk from the khedive ofEgypt. Haussez was to write in his memoirs:As soon as it was known in the learned world how I dreamt of enriching Francewith a monument that only Rome owned, I was put in charge to try and obtain twoobelisks much more precious … than those of Alexandria [which ended up in Londonand New York], and also much more difficult to transport by reason of theirlocation at Luxor.109 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1528]The operation was to take six years and Haussez was not to see it through.Hardly a year after he had come to office as minister of the navy, he was sackedduring the chaos that followed the July Revolution of 1830. The responsibilityfor the project then passed to the distinguished Baron Taylor, the son of anaturalised Englishman. Taylor was a patron of the arts, and was himself anaccomplished author. A friend of the geographer and archaeologist Jomard, Taylorhad a keen interest in ancient Egypt and diligently took over where Haussez hadleft off. Supplied with letters of recommendation from the king, and a generousbudget of 100,000 francs, he went to Egypt himself to meet the khedive and takecharge of the shipping operation. Taylor quickly assigned the task of theengineering works to Jean-Baptiste Apollinaire Lebas, a stocky and rather shortman whose small stature was to be the subject of much ridicule among theEgyptians, who could not believe that such a squat individual was given themission of moving so tall an obelisk all the way to France.It took from April to July 1831 for Lebas to get the purpose-built ship, theLuxor, from Toulon to Upper Egypt. It was summer, the heat at Luxor wasinsufferable – over 100 °F in the shade – and the whole affair was besieged byuntold problems, including a terrible cholera epidemic. But at the end, Lebasproved to be the right man for the job. By October he had managed to have theobelisk lowered safely and in one piece to the sand. Two further months followedwhile it was dragged the few hundred meters to the shore of the Nile and finallyhoisted onboard the Luxor. Then Lebas had to wait till July of the next year forthe inundation of the Nile in order to be able to sail downstream to Alexandria.After a delay of three months at Alexandria, the Luxor finally crossed theMediterranean and arrived at the French port of Toulon on 11 May 1833. Fromthere it was brought by river to Paris where it waited at the docks for threemore years.It was Louis-Philippe I who had personally long ago decided that the obeliskshould be raised on the axis of Paris in the centre of the Place de la Concorde,immediately west of the Tuileries Garden between the Louvre and the Arc deTriomphe.110 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1529] Now, at last, a datewas set for raising the obelisk. On 25 October 1836, a crowd of 200,000 peoplegathered at the Place de la Concorde to witness the event – more than hadassembled for the beheading of Louis XVI on the same spot 43 years earlier.Lebas personally supervised the difficult lifting operations which, toeverybody's admiration and delight, went without any hitches. Amid cheers ofjubilation and joy, Paris at long last had its very own solar talisman fromancient Egypt adorning its skyline. France now could fittingly claim for itscapital the name of the Cité de la Lumière (the ‘City of Light’) – or should wesay the ‘City of the Sun’?The beautiful obelisk standing in the Place de la Concorde was, and still is byvirtue of its great antiquity, the oldest monument of Paris. It witnessed thestory of Egypt from about 1500 BC and now in Paris it was to see the passing ofthe French monarchy and the creation of the Second Republic in 1848; the rise ofthe Second Empire under Napoleon III, the grandson of Napoleon Bonaparte, andits fall in 1871; the formation of the Third Republic under the ‘Masonic’government of Léon Gambetta;111 [35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1530]the First World War; and the Second World War; and finally, in 1958, the presentFifth Republic founded by General Charles de Gaulle.But it was not until 1984 that it would be joined in Paris by a modern structureevoking the Great Pyramid of Giza …MITTERRAND'S ‘GREAT WORKS’In 1981 François Mitterrand, then president of France, launched the so-calledGrands Travaux, the ‘Great Works’, which involved the construction of a seriesof impressive architectural projects to the glory and culture of France. Ineight years would come the bicentennial of the 1789 Revolution, and hugecelebrations were being planned by Mitterrand who, with a zeal reminiscent ofLouis XIV, wanted to furnish this event with great national monuments. Eitherintentionally or by coincidence the two monuments in which Mitterrand took greatpersonal interest evoked ancient Egypt and the Masonic Supreme Being or ‘GreatArchitect of the Universe’. These choices earned Mitterrand titles like Sphinx,Dieu (‘God’) and Roi Soleil (‘Sun King’) in France's satirical press.Although François Mitterrand was not a Freemason,112[35_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1531] he was nonetheless extremelysympathetic to the lodges – so much so that many in France remain convinced tothis day that he was a clandestine Mason. Much has been made in recent years ofthe fact that Guy Penne, one of Mitterrand's closest political advisers, was amember of the Supreme Council of the Grand Orient de France.113[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1532] There is also the scandalinvolving Mitterrand's son, Jean-Christophe, who, in 1982, joined the office ofPenne and in 1986 took over Penne's job. Jean-Christophe was exposed by theFrench press for his embroilment in the so-called Falcone Affair involving shadyarms deals in West Africa which also implicated some senior African politicianswho were members of Masonic lodges.114[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1533]The two projects that most interested President Mitterrand were those that wereto be readied for the bicentennial celebrations planned for July 1989. Theyinvolved the Grand Louvre project, which would ultimately feature a huge glassPyramid, and the Grande Arche de la Fraternité project at La Défense on theextreme western end of the Champs-Élysées. Under the personal directive ofMitterrand, two institutions, provided with special budgets set up under theMinistry of Finance, were created to administer these projects, one being theEPGL, l’Établissement public du Grand Louvre and the other being the EPAD,l’Établissement public pour l'aménagement de la région de la Défense. Tworenowned architects were then personally selected by Mitterrand: Ieoh Ming Pei,the celebrated Chinese-born American architect, for the Louvre,115[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1534] and Johan-Otto Von Spreckelsen,a Danish architect for the Grande Arche.116[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1535]President Mitterrand was so keen to have I. M. Pei for the Louvre that hedecided to bypass the normal requirements for an international tender and simplyoffered him the design commission.117[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1536] According to Pei these were thecircumstances:In July 1981, Paul Guimard asked to meet with me at the French Embassy in London… He told me that President Mitterrand wanted me to come to Paris … Only thePresident, Paul Guimard and myself were present at this meeting which took placeon December 11, 1981 …118 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1537]Pei claimed that at this first meeting with Mitterrand there was no specificmention of the Louvre Pyramid, and the president only spoke of ‘the importanceof architecture in French national life.’119[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1538] It was later, in 1983, thatMitterrand sent his advisor, Émile Biasini, to New York with instructions tocontract I. M. Pei directly for this project.120[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1539] When asked by a journalist whya pyramid was chosen for the Louvre which was a classical baroque design, Peireplied:Architecture is geometry – it's geometry. The Louvre is also geometry. It'sslightly tilted, but it's geometry … The French opposed it at first, but neverPresident Mitterrand. He never faltered in backing my idea …121[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1540]I. M. Pei insists that he borrowed the idea for a pyramid from ‘a garden trellisdesign of Le Nôtre, who laid out the vast gardens at Versailles for Louis XIVand also the gardens of the Tuilleries.’122[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1541] Perhaps so. Yet the slope whichPei finally chose for his pyramid was 50.71°, only about a degree different fromthe slope of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. Was the similarity deliberate?We shall perhaps never know. But here is how Pei's senior architect, YannWeymouth, replied when asked this question:Working with models and perspectives we studied form and site. We shaped thecentral skylight, studying it from ground level in perspectives and models. Witha perfect equilateral triangle as side, the 54.74° slope felt aggressive, but asthe slope approached 45° the form ‘melted’. The 50.71° finally chosen is closeto the slope of the Great Pyramid of Giza, so it is possible we were repeatingstudies made by the IVth Dynasty Egyptians.123[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1542]From the above statement it is clear that both Pei and Weymouth must in facthave studied the evolution of the fourth dynasty pyramids in Egypt with somecare. According to Egyptologists the first true pyramids were those of PharaohsSneferu and, his celebrated son, Cheops (Khufu) – and it is a well-known factthat their three pyramids (two at Dahshur plus the Great Pyramid at Giza) hadslopes starting near 54° (South Pyramid at Dahshur), then changed to 45° (NorthPyramid at Dahshur) and finally settled for 51.85° (Great Pyramid at Giza)!Given the historical importance of the project, the location of the site and thefact that it was to be a symbol for the bicentennial of the Revolution, Pei mustalso have been aware that several pyramid projects had been proposed for Parisin the past – such as those of Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude-Nicolas Ledoux,mentioned at the start of this chapter. He should also have known that duringthe reign of Louis XIV a pyramid to the glory of the Sun King had been proposedfor the Cour Carrée of the Louvre by the architect François Dubois,124[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1543] and also that a weird baroquepyramid with a statue of Napoleon on its top had been designed by the architectLouis-Ernest L’heureux to stand precisely where Pei eventually placed his glassPyramid.125 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1544] 56.

The headquarters of the Scottish Rite in Washington, DC (Courtesy JasonWeir).090 [images/grah_9781934708750_oeb_090_r1.jpg]The Grande Arche de la Fraternité project, unlike Pei's, was the subject of aninternational tender, but the final decision was nonetheless taken byMitterrand. Here is how the architect Von Spreckelsen described his design:An open cube, a window open to the world … with a gaze towards the future. It isa modern Arc de Triomphe, to the glory of the triumph of humanity; it is asymbol of hope that in the future people may meet freely …126[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1545]The Grande Arche is indeed a nearly perfect cubical structure 110 meters tall by112 meters deep with a base that is just over one hectare in area. It isestimated that the Cathedral of Notre Dame would fit quite well in the void ofthe arch. In the official guide it is described as a monument that ‘evokes thesense of the sacred … which compares to the Egyptian pyramids.’127[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1546] On the rooftop the artistJean-Pierre Raynaud created a zodiac to inspire ‘a real dialogue with thecelestial vault, which is the true natural architecture’,128[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1547] and one might add on his behalfthat his design was a sort of ‘as above so below’ concept.On the top floor of the Grande Arche is the headquarters of the Fondationl’Arche de la Fraternité, the ‘Foundation of the Arch of the Brotherhood’, whichincludes Claude Cheysson, a former minister of foreign affairs, as a pastpresident. The foundation dates from the 1970s when it was established as ahuman rights organisation headed by Edgar Faure, formerly president of France inthe 1950s. When in the early 1980s President Mitterrand began to make it knownthat he wanted the Grande Arche monument to be a symbol of ‘Fraternity andLiberty’, Edgar Faure proposed to him that the foundation's headquarters inParis should be moved to the Grande Arche building at La Défense.129[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1548]MYSTERIES OF THE AXISThe Grande Arche project was completed on time for the bicentennial of theRevolution and was inaugurated with much fanfare by President Mitterrand on 14July 1989. The final result is stunning. The Grande Arche can be seen from milesaway, and, after the Eiffel Tower, it is unquestionably the most imposinglandmark of Paris. Jean-Claude Garcias, who wrote the text for the officialguidebook of the Grande Arche, described it as the monument of the 1980s thatinspires the collective mind with the ‘instinct of immortality’.130[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1549] Moreover Garcias saw the GrandeArche not as a project that came out fully formed ‘from the brain of itsarchitect’, but rather as ‘the end product to a long and sinuous urban axiswhich was begun in the 17th century and which’, he says, ‘can be schematised asfollows’:Born in the open court of the Louvre, but deviated six degrees towards the northduring the run through the Tuilleries, the great east-west axis of Paris has itsorigins in the avenue of trees planted by Le Nôtre at the beginning of the reignof Louis XIV, who opened the perspective towards the setting sun … It wasfollowed by the development of the present Place de la Concorde under Louis XV,then the levelling of the slope on which today stands the Arc de Triomphe andthe avenue of the Champs-Élysées. At the end of the Old Regime the engineerPerronet built the first stone bridge at Neuilly, taking the axis all the way tothe hill of Chantecoq, our present area of La Défense …131[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1550]The Grande Arche, therefore, much appears to be the culmination an ongoing chainof ideas, an occult plan one might even venture to say, which began with the SunKing Louis XIV and ended with President François Mitterrand – who was jokinglyreferred to by the French as Le Roi Soleil because of the ambition of his GrandsProjets scheme. Let us note in passing here that Mitterrand had also one moreGrand Projet in store for La Défense: a skyscraper 400 meters tall called LaTour Sans Fin. This monster of a building was designed by the architect JeanNouvel,132 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1551] and, unlike mostskyscrapers, was to feature varying levels of transparency acting as ‘skyfilters’, such that at the top it would become fully transparent and disappearinto the clouds.133 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1552] What wasintended, here, was an allusion to the biblical ‘Tower of Babel’, a universaltalisman of the first magnitude that is also a popular Freemasonic pictogramoften held to be a symbol for the origins of the Craft.134[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1553] The Tour Sans Fin, however, waseventually scrapped due to lack of funds and the immense impracticality of theidea.135 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1554]Unquestionably, the Grande Arche occupies the place of honour on the westernextremity of the axis of Paris. It is the final ‘sunset’ of a great plan whose‘sunrise’, as we have seen, was the ‘miraculous birth’ of the Sun King Louis XIVat the Louvre – but whose first sunrise, we suggest, took place long ago and faraway in ancient Egypt. The Grande Arche thus becomes an integral part of amonumental array of talismans strung out along the axis of Paris, notably theArc de Triomphe at the Place de l’Étoile and the Luxor Obelisk at the Place dela Concorde. The axis then enters the precinct of the Tuileries Garden to makeit way to the Louvre. When the axis is traced eastwards towards the Louvre, thereader will recall from Chapter Seventeen that it passes first through thebronze equestrian statue of Louis XIV represented as ‘Alexander the Great’,placed to the south of Pei's glass Pyramid. East again and we find that the axistransects the south wing of the Louvre and then enters the private apartments ofAnne of Austria, Louis XIV’s mother – the very place where the ‘Capetianmiracle’ of Louis XIV’s conception took place in December 1637.Interestingly, the full effect of the ensemble of these ‘Masonic’ and ‘Egyptian’monuments and, more specifically, of their alignments, was not to be unveiled onthe bicentennial day of 14 July 1989, but exactly a year later when the Frenchcomposer Jean Michel Jarre was commissioned to organise a special concert at thePlace de la Grande Arche de la Défense for 14 July 1990. Why and how Jarre waschosen for this event is not clear, but it was to prove an amazing extravaganzaof sound, light and fireworks the likes of which Paris had never seen before,not even during the Revolution when Jean-Jacques David and Robespierre hadinaugurated the era of the Supreme Being near the Louvre.Beginning at dusk on 14 July 1990, an estimated two million people filled theChamps-Élysées as if coming to attend some weird Hermetic Mass. On that strangenight all the relevant monuments on the Historical Axis – Grande Arche, the Arcde Triomphe, the Luxor Obelisk and, of course, the Louvre Pyramid – were lit upas if to reveal a magical landscape for Paris.The orchestra of Jean Michel Jarre, with the chorus wearing long, flowing whiterobes giving them a surreal appearance, were positioned at the foot of theGrande Arche inside a huge, makeshift metal-framed pyramid that was lit up withlaser lights.The lasers projected images onto the façades of adjacent skyscrapers. Many ofthese images were reminiscent of Hermetic-Masonic symbols, especially a set oflarge eyes projected on the sides of the Pyramid.Eight years later, in May 1998, Jarre would be commissioned to perform a similarshow, this time involving the Great Pyramid of Giza itself. While the show tookplace at Giza, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and other officials of hisgovernment attended a special ceremony at the Place de la Concorde in Paris atwhich a golden capstone was placed on top of the Luxor Obelisk.136[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1555] During this ceremony Egypt'sminister of culture, Dr. Farouk Hosni, announced that a golden capstone wouldalso be placed on top of the Great Pyramid of Giza at midnight on 31 December1999 as a symbol for the new millennium. Weeks later Jarre was officiallycommissioned to organise that event.ROBERT BAUVAL'S EUREKA AFTERNOON (1)On an afternoon in the early spring of 1992, Robert Bauval happened to be at theLouvre Museum bookshop and bought a copy of an archaeological journal containinga major pictorial on the city of Luxor. The journal was Dossiers: Histoire etArchéologie,137 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1556] and the articlein question was the work of a number of different authorities including Dr.Mohamad El-Saghir, director of antiquities at the Luxor Museum, and William J.Murnane and Lany D. Bell of the University of Chicago Epigraphic Survey.Earlier that same day Bauval had also visited the Grande Arche at La Défense,and there, on the top floor, was an exhibition room featuring a superb aerialphotograph of the city of Paris showing the whole length of the Historical Axisfrom the Bastille in the east all the way to the district of La Défense in thewest. The photograph was several feet long, and showed every detail clearly: thedistinctive crab-shaped layout of the Louvre, the Tuilleries Garden (evenindividual trees were visible), the Place de la Concorde and the Luxor Obelisk,the Arc de Triomphe, all the skyscrapers at La Défense and, of course, theGrande Arche. A security officer was standing nearby, and with his permissionBauval videoed the impressive aerial view, then took section shots of it withhis still camera. A scale model of the axis of Paris, showing the main monumentsand buildings, was also part of the exhibition so Bauval photographed and filmedthis as well.Bauval then left the La Defence area and travelled underground by Metro directlyto the Louvre. All the way he pondered on the aerial photograph and scale modelof the axis of Paris, refreshing his memory of the details by reviewing thefootage he had shot with his video camera. Seeing the city as a whole from theair in this way, and scaled down in a three-dimensional model, gave a veryspecial perspective – a high vantage point from which the metropolis seemed toreveal itself like some giant jigsaw puzzle that had been put together over thecenturies.Though one could be forgiven for not noticing it at all at ground level, whatparticularly stood out in the aerial view was the curious way that the axis ofParis slightly changed direction as it emerged from the Louvre and headed west.It seemed, on face value, that this had been done to have the Tuilleries Gardenparallel to the course of the River Seine. But even so, it was clear that theaxis could have been set true again as it emerged from the Tuilleries Gardeninto the Place de la Concorde. Here the Seine actually took a slight turn to thesouth, whereas the axis was turned slightly in the opposite direction towardsthe north.This curious anomaly bothered the structural engineer in Robert Bauval. Hewanted to think that the deviation of the axis of Paris had been due to apractical problem, but somehow this explanation did not quite suffice in soambitious a scheme where careful, coordinated deliberation was the obviouskeynote throughout. One could see that deliberation, for example in thedistances between the principal symbolic monuments placed along the axis and inthe relative sizes of the three ‘arches’. As the guide books like to point out:Curiously the distance between them doubles each time: 1 km from the Carrouseltriumphal arch to the Concorde's Obelisk, 2 km from the Obelisk to the Arc deTriomphe at the top of the Champs-Élysées, and 4 km from there to the GrandArche. Even more curiously, the size of the arches also doubles at eachstage.138 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1557]So since everything else seemed to have been planned to produce a specialsymbolic effect wasn't it likely that the deviation of the axis was also part ofthe symbolic scheme?ROBERT BAUVAL'S EUREKA AFTERNOON (2)As Bauval stepped out of the Metro station at the Louvre he decided on impulseto take a stroll along the nearby parts of the axis of Paris before visiting themuseum. The aerial view of the axis, and the problems that it raised, were stillvivid in his mind.He first walked to the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde, and there,placing himself with his back to the west face of the Luxor Obelisk, lookeddirectly up the Champs-Élysées and along the axis of Paris. It shot straight asan arrow westward, past the Arc de Triomphe and all the way to Grande Arche sixkilometers away.He next placed himself on the east side of the Luxor Obelisk and looked backeastwards towards the Louvre. The axis shot straight along the centerline of theTuilleries Garden and all the way to the Arc du Carrousel outside the Louvre'sopen court. But it was at this point that the troubling ‘deviation’ occurred forthe eastwards extension of the axis did not merge, as one would have expected,with the central axis of the Louvre but instead crossed it and carried on alongthe Louvre's south wing.Bauval now walked to the Arc du Carrousel, found the exact spot where the axischanged direction, and looked again east towards the Louvre. As he had thought,the axis of Paris did not extend through the glass Pyramid and the centerline ofthe Louvre, but instead ran to the right (south) of the Pyramid and neatlythrough the imposing bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIV in the style ofAlexander the Great. Beyond the statue Bauval could see that the axisintersected with the Louvre at the second window of the façade of the PavillonSully. The window, by luck, was open. So Bauval decided to go there, figuringthat he would be able to get a good shot with his camera of the whole axis ofParis looking west.To reach the window, Bauval had to go to the first floor of the Pavillon Sullyand pass through a series of rooms in which where displayed works from theLouvre's extensive Greek and Egyptian collections. On the ceiling of one ofthese rooms – number 30 on the guide map – was the mysterious painting by Picotthat we described in Chapter One. Bauval had seen this painting before, ofcourse, and remembered the curious scene of the Hermeslike ‘Genie of Paris’witnessing the ‘unveiling of Isis’ to reveal an obelisk and pyramids in thedistance. Now, with the Luxor Obelisk and Louvre Pyramid fresh in his memory, hecould not help noticing how the obelisk and the pyramids in Picot's paintingalso appeared to be aligned in a perspective towards the distant horizon, justlike those on the axis of Paris.Realising that he was standing not far from where the axis of Paris crossed theLouvre, Bauval was startled by this strange coincidence but shrugged off thethought and made his way to the open window. From there, as he had hoped, he hada spectacular view westward along the axis of Paris, past the Luxor Obelisk,past the Arc de Triomphe and all the way to the distant Grande Arche. Now thathe was attuned to it, the deviation of the axis was also quite unmissable.Bauval snapped a few photographs then made his way to the bookshop in the lowerfloor of the museum where, as noted earlier, he purchased an archaeologicaljournal containing a detailed pictorial of the city of Luxor in Upper Egypt.ROBERT BAUVAL'S EUREKA AFTERNOON (3)After browsing in the bookshop Bauval left the Louvre by the exit under theglass Pyramid. Outside in the courtyard, in bright sunshine, he found a seat andbegan to leaf through the pages of the journal he had just bought, Dossiers:Histoire et Archéologie. One of its double-page spreads featured a superb colourphotograph of the Luxor temple from the air. The photograph was taken lookingwest towards the Nile with the temple sprawling from left to right (i.e. fromsouth to north), and thus parallel to the course of the Nile. A single obeliskstood conspicuously in front of the temple's entrance on the north side. Next toit Bauval could clearly make out the empty plinth where once had stood thesecond obelisk that was now in Paris – and, weirdly, within his sight from wherehe now sat! How strange to think that these two distant points on the earth'ssurface, one in front of the Luxor temple in Thebes and the other in front ofthe Louvre Palace in Paris, had been brought together, as it were, by thisancient pair of solar talismans.Bauval looked more closely at the photograph. Seen from this high altitude, itwas funny how the crab-shaped outline of the Luxor temple and the way it waspositioned along the River Nile, could easily be mistaken for the Louvre's samecrab-like shape and the way that it, too, was positioned along the River Seine.With a mounting sense of excitement Bauval turned the pages of the journal andquickly found what he hoped it would contain – a second aerial photograph takenfrom much higher up that showed the whole layout of the city of Luxor, from theTemple of Luxor in the south to the Temple of Karnak in the north.Now this was really strange!Although he knew that he was looking at an aerial photograph of Karnak-Luxor,Bauval was overtaken by a powerful sense of visual déjà vue. He had seen thevery same ‘image’ with the very same features just a short while before, but notin a photograph of Luxor. He played back the video film he had just taken at theGrande Arche – the video film of the aerial-view of Paris. Looking at it, andthen again at the aerial photograph of Luxor in the archaeological journal, itwas obvious that there were remarkable similarities between the layout of Parisfrom the Louvre to La Défense and the layout of the sacred Egyptian city fromthe Luxor Temple to Karnak!The positioning and provenance of the obelisks were part of the puzzle. But evenmore stunning was the way that the axis of Paris and the axis of Luxor bothchanged direction at roughly the same place as they headed one towards LaDéfense, and the other towards Karnak. Bauval knew, however, that in Egypt, theNile ran from south-north and that the Luxor temple faced north; whereas inParis the Seine was directed east to west and the Louvre ‘temple’ faced west.Champollion and Lebas would have been acutely aware of these orientations. Ifthey had really been participants in some mysterious game of symbolism,therefore, then surely they would have taken them into account?An observation by the historian Jean Vidal in a Paris guidebook helpfullysettled the matter:Let us note … that in the position that it occupies at the Place de la Concorde,the four sides of the obelisk have changed orientation: the north side at Luxoris today turned to the west and directed towards the Champs-Élysées.139[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1558]Gazing back and forth from the aerial view of Paris to the aerial view of Luxor,it was as if both images had a will of their own, wanting to merge with oneanother. Bauval looked up and towards the distant Luxor Obelisk at the Place dela Concorde. It was as though a veil was slowly being lifted from the city ofParis just like the veil so tantalisingly lifted in Picot's painting …ARCHITECTURE FULFILLING PROPHECYRemember how the Hermetic philosopher Tommaso Campanella predicted in 1638 thatParis would become an ‘Egyptian’ City of the Sun? Now Bauval had found whatlooked like an unmistakable architectural correlation between Paris and a ‘Cityof the Sun’ in Egypt – i.e. Thebes-Luxor. It was all very weird and yet at thesame time strangely logical.He imagined himself like the genie in Picot's painting, hovering over the Placede la Bastille to witness the unveiling of an Egyptian landscape. It was asecret landscape that had been slowly prepared and hidden in plain view in thestreets of Paris. This had called for a purposeful multi-generational buildingand city-planning project that began when Le Nôtre first deviated the axis ofthe Tuileries Garden to 26° north-of-west in 1665 and was only completed in 1989more than 300 years later.Was it a conspiracy, or just a conspiracy theory? Were the similarities of theaxis of Paris and the axis of Luxor just coincidences or something else?What made it seem more likely to be ‘something else’, and indeed some sort ofconspiracy, was the whole mysterious connection that had linked ancient Egyptand particularly the goddess Isis to the city of Paris for centuries. Nor –weird though it admittedly seemed – was it easy to set aside the matter ofCampanella's prophecy, made at the birth of the ‘solar-king’ Louis XIV, thatParis was to become a ‘City of the Sun’ modelled on the golden age of ancientEgypt.It was then that something else suddenly hit Bauval. At about the same time thatthe French Republicans were planning monumental urban projects to refurbish thecity of Paris between 1789 and 1794, there was another group of ‘brothers’ andrepublicans planning to design a city from scratch on the other side of theAtlantic.And there, too, strange geometrical layouts and alignments evoking Hermetic andMasonic ideas came to the surface …"},{"pageContent":"The extraordinary truth is that the very existence of the Washington Monument[an obelisk] is intimately linked with the Egyptian star Sirius … How is it thatthe most important star of the ancient world should find itself, as it were,resurrected in the architecture of the United States?David Ovason, The Secret Zodiacs of Washington DC If, as Thomas Jeferson argued, the Capitol represents ‘the first templededicated to the sovereignty of the people’, then the [Masonic] brothers of the1793 ceremony served as its first high-priests.Steven C. Bullock, Revolutionary Brotherhood Washington DC can fairly be described as the world's foremost ‘Masonic City.’Its centre was laid out according to a plan drawn up by the French FreemasonPierre L’Enfant.Freemasonry Today, Issue 16091 [images/grah_9781934708750_oeb_091_r1.jpg]CHAPTER NINETEENTHE CORNERSTONEIf a monument or a building – or even, as we now can see, a whole city – canbecome like a living heart, a talisman charged with powerful ideologies andmeaning, then the ‘pacemaker’ of such a talisman must be its cornerstone.In ancient times, and in many different cultures, the dedication ceremony for anew temple or stately monument often called for elaborate rituals performed bythe ruler. During such ceremonies the objective was to call upon a god orgoddess to cast his or her benevolent and protective powers on the building – oreven to beseech the deity to descend from the heavenly world and reside withinthe temple. A crucial element was the placing of a permanent marker tocommemorate the ceremony, generally in the form of the ‘first stone’ or‘cornerstone’.In medieval Europe, in direct continuation of such ancient ideas, the laying ofthe cornerstone for a church or cathedral was understood to symbolise the‘raising of the building into the light of day, into consciousness or towardsthe heavens.’1 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1559] In this respectit was vital that the most propitious moment be selected when participants couldbe assured that the influences of the stellar and planetary deities were attheir very best. To that end a ‘horoscope’ was cast.To modern Freemasons the cornerstone ceremony remains one of paramountimportance. It serves not only as a link to their ‘operative’ ancestors whobuilt temples and cathedrals, but also as a potent symbol of renewal and‘rebirth’. It expresses itself with particular force in the Masonic aspiration(whether taken literally or metaphorically) to ‘rebuild Solomon's Temple’ inJerusalem and to lay its cornerstone. Indeed, for Masons and non-Masons alike,there are few other talismans that can evoke so much fervour – benevolent ordestructive. Think of the Crusades, the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the on-goingPalestinian intifada, and you begin to feel the energy that this talisman iscapable of unleashing. The finding and re-placing of the cornerstone of arenewed Temple of Solomon would set off an intellectual and spiritual explosionthat would have huge ramifications for the Middle East and for the world.In many ancient buildings we find that the cornerstone was embedded into thewall of a crypt or basement that had been carefully prepared prior to theceremony. According to Masonic author David Ovason:Symbolically speaking, the crypt is the burial place. It is the earth into whichthe seed of wheat must be dropped, to grow and resurrect, emerging as asprouting plant from the coffin. In Masonry, the crypt is the burial place ofthe Master Mason, under the Holy of Holies … This idea of rebirth is continuedeven in modern times in the formal ritual of the Freemasonic cornerstoneceremonials, in which participants in the ritual scatter wheat upon the floor,and sometimes even link this seeding with the stars.2[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1560]It is known that from the earliest days of their civilisation the ancientEgyptians performed a ‘stellar’ ritual – a form of ‘astral magic’ – during thecornerstone ceremonies for their pyramids and temples. This ritual involvedreference to the circumpolar stars in the northern sky, and, in the southernsky, to the stars of Orion and, more especially, the star Sirius.3[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1561] In Ovason's view ‘it was thispromise of stellar immutability which first led the ancient Egyptian priests,and their pupils, the Greek architects, to orientate their temples to thestars’. The very same promise, says Ovason, leads Masonic architects to ensurethat their buildings and city plans are ‘also laid out with a geometry whichreflect[s] the wisdom of the stellar lore.’4[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1562]THE ‘RAISING’ OF WASHINGTONOn 18 September 1793, a little more than a month after the ‘Isis’ ceremony washeld at the Place de la Bastille in Paris,5[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1563] another ceremony laden heavilywith specific symbolic referents took place on a high point known as JenkinsHill on the other side of the Atlantic. At the climax of this ceremony,America's first president, George Washington, wearing a Masonic apron which hadbeen presented to him by the Marquis de Lafayette, laid the cornerstone of theUS Capitol in the presence of a congregation of high-ranking Freemasons.6[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1564]Surveyor, farmer, and Episcopalian, George Washington was born at Pope's Creekin Virginia. He grew up near the town of Fredericksburg on his father'splantation. As a young man he studied mathematics and surveying, and eventuallyjoined the Virginia militia where he excelled. In 1775, at the age of 43, he waselected by the Continental Congress to serve as commander-in-chief of theRevolutionary army to fight the British. After the War of Independence was over,Washington retired from the army, and in 1789 the state of Virginia sent him tothe Constitutional Convention where he was unanimously elected as president ofthe United States. He was re-elected without opposition in 1792, refused a thirdterm in 1796 and died at Mount Vernon in 1799 from laryngitis at the age of 67.George Washington became a Freemason in 1752 in Fredericksburg, and was ‘raised’as a Master Mason the following year.7[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1565] In 1777, when the Freemasons inthe American colonies sought to form a ‘United’ Grand Lodge independent fromEngland, they offered the position of Grand Master to Washington, but hemodestly declined, saying that he was not qualified for this high office. In1788, however, he did become Master of the Alexandria lodge, today known as theAlexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22, situated on the south side of the PotomacRiver near the city of Washington, DC. Since 1932 this famous lodge has beenengulfed within a huge Masonic monument built around it. The monument ismodelled on the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria in Egypt,8[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1566] the Pharos, and bears theofficial name of the George Washington Masonic National Monument.9[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1567] According to Harvey WileyCorbett of the New York firm Helmle & Corbett who designed this monument:… the Pharos was erected to guide the ancient mariners safely to shore; whatwould be more appropriate than a facsimile of that Lighthouse in Alexandria,Virginia on top of the highest hill and overlooking the Potomac River?10[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1568]ISIS OF THE SUEZ CANALBoth H. W. Corbett and Louis A. Watres – the latter representing the ‘client’ –were themselves Freemasons, and as such would have known that the ancient Pharosof Alexandria had been dedicated to Isis and also to her star, Sothis-Sirius.Nor was this the only time that Freemasons would evoke Isis and her star in alandmark monument in the United States. According to Bernard Weisberger, Isiswas also in the mind of the designer of the Statue of Liberty that now stands inNew York Harbor:The sculptor who made the great statue was Italian. His name was AugusteBartholdi. His work was greatly influenced by the ancient sculptor Phidias whomade gigantic statues of the ancient goddesses, particularly Athena, the‘goddess of wisdom’ and Nemesis, a goddess who held a cup in her right hand.Before beginning the Statue of Liberty project, Bartholdi was seeking acommission to construct a giant statue of the goddess ‘Isis’, the Egyptian Queenof Heaven, to overlook the Suez Canal. The statue of Isis was to be of ‘a robedwoman holding aloft a torch’.11 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1569]Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi was born in France, at the city of Colmar in Alsace.He had studied in Paris at the prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand, and, in 1855,when he was only 21, he embarked on a voyage to Egypt with three friends, theorientalists Léon Gerôme, Léon-Auguste-Adolphe Belly and Narcisse Berchère.There, while visiting the ancient temples of Thebes and Abu Simbel, Bartholdibecame enchanted by the gigantic works of the ancient Egyptian sculptors. Hespent eight months documenting the Colossi of Memnon and returned to France withnumerous sketches and photographs.It was during that first voyage to Egypt that Bartholdi met the celebratedFrench engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps, and thus began a friendship between thepair that was to last a lifetime. De Lesseps was negotiating funding with theauthorities in France and Egypt for the construction of the Suez Canal to jointhe Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea. Bartholdi was deeply impressed with deLesseps's vision and began to think how he might complement it by creating agigantic statue of a goddess holding a torch. Bartholdi imagined this statuepositioned at the entrance to the canal and representing ‘Egypt Enlightening theEast’ – a name, as most French Freemasons knew in those days, which wasstrangely reminiscent of Cagliostro's famous saying that ‘All Enlightenmentcomes from the East, all initiation from Egypt’.12[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1570]Khedive Isma'il of Egypt, another Freemason, was much enamoured with thebeautiful French Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, and indeed with allthings French. Eugénie was a cousin of Ferdinand de Lesseps, and it was she whoput in a good word to the khedive to look favourably on the Suez Canal project.We saw in Chapter Eighteen that de Lesseps's father, Mathieu, together withMuhammad Ali, Isma'il's grandfather, had founded the Société Secrète Égyptiennewhich practiced a form of Scottish Rite Freemasonry merged with Cagliostro'sEgyptian Rite.13 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1571]It seems that Bartholdi did manage to discuss his idea of a giant statue for theSuez Canal with Khedive Isma'il, but nothing came of it, probably because of thefinancial crisis that had then struck Egypt due to overborrowing from Europeanbankers. But, Bartholdi was not disheartened in the least and took his projectelsewhere.ISIS OF NEW YORK, A TALISMAN TO ‘LIBERTY’The idea of a similar monument to commemorate the friendship between France andthe United States for the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independencewas first discussed by Bartholdi and others at the home, near Paris, of ÉdouardRené de Laboulaye, an authority on North American culture. It seems thatBartholdi simply ‘converted’ his original project for Egypt and proposed itinstead as a ‘Statue of Liberty enlightening the world’ for New York. To thisend the so-called Union Franco-Américaine (Franco-American Union) wasestablished in 1875 to raise the necessary funds.Not unexpectedly, several members of the Franco-American Union turn out to havebeen Freemasons, including Bartholdi's own cousin, who was the French ambassadorto the United States. Other Freemasons also actively involved were Henri Martin,the Count of Tocqueville and Oscar de Lafayette. Bartholdi himself had beeninitiated into Freemasonry in 1875 at the Paris lodge Alsace-Lorraine, and wasraised as a Master Mason in 1880.Although Bartholdi was to be the designer of the Statue of Liberty, the actualtask of building it fell on Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, the celebrated Frenchstructural engineer who would also design and build the Eiffel Tower in Paris.Eiffel, too, was a Freemason – so let us note in passing that the first twolevels of his famous steel tower, according to French engineer Jean Kerisel, areshaped like a pyramid.14 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1572] Eiffelwould certainly have been aware that about a century before, in 1792, a pyramidhad been erected on the very same spot on the Champs de Mars in Paris tocommemorate the French Revolution.15[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1573]Here's what the Reader's Companion to American History has to say about theinspiration behind the Statue of Liberty:Sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi combined elements of the Egyptian pyramidshe admired with his mother's face to serve as a model for the statue, which hefinished early in 1884.16 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1574]There has been much dispute about whether the face of the Statue of Liberty wasmodelled on that of Bartholdi's own mother, and the matter, though trivial, hasnot been settled. What is more certain is that the statue was linked to the‘cult of Liberty’ or the ‘Cult of Reason’ of the French Revolution, both ofwhich, in the minds of Republicans, were intimately connected to Masonic ideals.It is certain, too, as we saw in Chapter One, that figures representing‘Liberty’ and ‘Reason’ were often modelled on the Egyptian goddess Isis or herGreek and Roman counterparts.Interestingly, according to French Egyptologist Bernard Mathieu, Bartholdi usedto refer to the Statue of Liberty as the ‘Pharos’ before it was raised in NewYork, and he even designed a base for the statue just like the one believed tohave been used for the ancient Pharos of Alexandria.17[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1575] Bartholdi, who had spent muchtime in Egypt and had studied the origins of this ancient ‘wonder of the world’,would certainly have known the association of the Pharos with the goddess Isis –and, by extension, her star, Sirius – that we explored in Chapter Ten. In thisrespect, it seems highly likely that his giant statue of ‘a robed woman holdingaloft a torch’ to serve as a sort of lighthouse for the Suez Canal and, later,for New York Harbor, may well have been imagined by him as Isis-Pharia and theLighthouse of Alexandria.GARIBALDI, ‘HERO OF THE TWO WORLDS’There is, too, an aspect of Bartholdi's life that is rarely considered in thiscontext but which, we think, had a bearing on his state of mind when he designedthe statue.Bartholdi was a close friend of the Italian revolutionary hero, GiuseppeGaribaldi, the leading military man behind the Italian Unification known as theRisorgimento. Along with the politicians Camillo Benso, the Count of Cavour, andGiuseppe Mazzini. Garibaldi is regarded as one of the founding fathers of modernItaly. It was said that Cavour was the ‘intelligence’ behind the Risorgimentoand Mazzini its ‘spiritual drive’. Garibaldi was the ‘fighting force’ that wasessential to bring it to fruition. His famous quip, ‘Give me the ready handrather than ready tongue’, encapsulates the spirit of this remarkable man. Notsurprisingly, we find that for his heroic deeds in Italy and also in therevolutions in South America, Garibaldi – like the Marquis de Lafayette beforehim – earned the title ‘Hero of Two Worlds.’Garibaldi was born in Nice and served as a sailor in the merchant navy for manyyears. In 1833 while in Marseilles he met the great Italian patriot GiuseppeMazzini who recruited him into the so-called La Giovane Italia (‘Young Italy’),that spearheaded the Italian National Movement. The charismatic Mazzini was tohave a deep and lasting impact on Garibaldi who, throughout his life, oftenreferred to him as his ‘Master.’ Freemasonry was particularly active in theliberation movement,18 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1576] andGiuseppe Mazzini, who was often called the ‘apostle of the Italian Republic’,was a staunch Freemason. He was elevated as a 33rd degree Mason of the ScottishRite by the Grand Orient of Palermo in 1864.19[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1577]Garibaldi himself was initiated into the Carbonari secret society in 1833,20[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1578] and then into regularFreemasonry in 1844. In 1862 he was made a 33rd degree Mason in Palermo, and in1864 was elected in Florence as the Grand Master of all Italian Freemasonry. In1870, when the Prussians put Paris under siege, Garibaldi, ever the hero, rushedto the rescue with a contingent of Italian volunteers to defend the newlydeclared Third Republic of France headed by France's first president, theFreemason Léon Gambetta.21 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1579] Forhis military successes against the Prussians, Gambetta, invited Garibaldi tobecome a member of the National Assembly in Paris. In 1880 Garibaldi joined the‘Egyptian’ Rite of Memphis and, a year later, he was appointed as the firstGeneral Grand Master of a ‘united’ Masonic order, the Ancient and Primitive Riteof Memphis-Misraïm.22 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1580]AN ‘ADMIRABLE SPOT’ FOR A GLOBAL TALISMANIt was in France, during the military campaign of 1870, that Garibaldi wasintroduced to the sculptor Bartholdi, who was then a major in the French army.Bartholdi served for a while as Garibaldi's personal aide-decamp , but a fewmonths later went to America proposing ‘to glorify the Republic and Liberty overthere.’ He arrived in New York in July 1871. Upon entering New York Harbor, heknew immediately where his gigantic statue of ‘Liberty’ should one day stand:The picture that is presented to the view when one arrives in New York ismarvellous … When one awakes, so to speak, in the midst of that interior seacovered with vessels … it is thrilling. It is, indeed, the New World … I’vefound an admirable spot. It is Bedloe's Island, in the middle of the bay … justopposite the Narrows, which are, so to speak, the gateway to America.23[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1581]In the US Bartholdi made good use of the letters of introduction he had beengiven by high-ranking French Freemasons. He met with many notables and veteransof the Civil War, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Horace Greeley, SenatorCharles Sumner, and President Ulysses S. Grant. To each in turn he talked up hisbig idea while showing them drawings and a model of the statue which he nowcalled ‘Liberty Enlightening the World’.The project, of course, was a success, and created the powerful global talismanthat now stands in New York Harbor. Meanwhile the very intense Masonicinvolvement in the whole affair was made lucidly evident on 5 August 1984 when abronze plaque was affixed to the pedestal of the statue. The plaque reads asfollows:At this site on August 5th, 1884, the cornerstone of the pedestal of the statueof ‘Liberty Enlightening the World’ was laid with ceremony by William A. Brodie,Grand Master of Masons in the State of New York. Grand Lodge Members,Representatives of the United States and French Governments, Army and Navyofficers, members of Foreign legations, and distinguished citizens were present.This plaque is dedicated by the Masons of New York in commemoration of the 100thAnniversary of that historic event. M. W. Calvin O. Bond, Grand Master of MasonsP. W. Robert G. Singer, Deputy Grand MasterM. W. Arthur Markwich, Masonic Anniversary Chairman August 5, 1984 24 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1582]At the original ceremony on 5 August 1884 Grand Master William Brodie was askedwhy the Masonic fraternity had been called upon to lay the cornerstone of theStatue of Liberty. He replied:No other organisation has ever done more to promote liberty and to liberate menfrom the chains of ignorance and tyranny than Freemasonry.25[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1583]One could say the same down the ages of the Gnostics and the Hermeticists intheir original Alexandrian context in Egypt and later in their Cathar andRenaissance incarnations of the Middle Ages. All along the object of thesesubversive religions, whether taught by Valentinus or Mani, Bruno or Campanella,has indeed been to liberate mankind ‘from the chains of ignorance and tyranny’.A SHORT DIVERSION: IN GOD WE TRUSTWe tend to forget, or not fully appreciate, the quasi-religious fervour of theFounding Fathers of the United States of America, acting as if they wereinspired, indeed directly guided, by ‘Divine Providence’. Through the wholesequence of events that led to the War of Independence and the signing of theConstitution there was a clear understanding among the main protagonists,especially George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, that they were working under‘Divine Providence’ and that the creation of the new nation was to be under the‘patronage’ of God. More specifically, they saw ‘America’ as part of a ‘DivinePlan’ for mankind.The question, therefore, that needs to be asked – nay, begs to be asked – iswhich ‘God’ did the Founding Fathers have in mind? Because there has to be avery strong possibility that the god whose patronage they felt themselves to beunder was not the Christian deity in any conventional sense, but rather the‘Grand Architect of the Universe’ – that uniquely ‘Masonic God’ represented bythe letter ‘G’ on the Masonic aprons of Washington, Franklin and others whoplayed such a crucial role on the creation of the United States.The notion that the American Republic and its people were under the directprotection and guidance of heaven is immediately apparent in the Great Seal ofthe United States – featuring the famous symbol of the pyramid with the ‘Eye ofProvidence’ set in the capstone hovering above it. Variants of this strikingsymbol have been used to invoke the presence of the Almighty since at least thetime of the ancient Egyptians – for whom it was the eye of the sun-god watchingover mankind. The motto on the Great Seal, Annuit Cœptis, ‘He [God] favoured ourundertakings’, should be enough to confirm this point.There are, too, the various inspirational speeches made by Washington, Franklinand other Founding Fathers which leave no doubt that they believed they werefulfilling God's Plan in the creation of the Republic and the drafting of theConstitution. For example, when the Constitutional Convention could not reachconsensus on the draft, Franklin made an impassioned plea for divine help:God governs in the affairs of men. If a sparrow cannot fall to ground withoutHis notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? I … believethis and also that without His concurring aid, we shall succeed in thispolitical building no better than the builders of Babel … I therefore beg leaveto move, that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven and itsBlessings on our deliberations be held in this Assembly every morning before weproceed to business.26 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1584]On 3 October 1789, just a few months after the French populace stormed theBastille and set in motion the creation of the First Republic on European soil,George Washington issued a proclamation to ‘assign Thursday the 26th Day ofNovember next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of thatgreat and glorious Being …’… that we may then all unite in rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanksfor his kind care and protection of the People of this country … to enable usall, whether in public or private sanctions … to promote the knowledge andpractice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them andUs, and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperityas He alone knows best.27 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1585]The day of ‘rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks’ became, of course,Thanksgiving Day which, since 1863, has been a national holiday celebrated byAmericans each November on the fourth Thursday of the month. It is undoubtedlythe case that ceremonies of this kind had been held before 1789, but theproclamation marked the first time that ‘Thanksgiving’ was sanctioned asofficial government policy. It is worth reiterating that Washington clearly didnot have in mind a ‘harvest festival’, as many now mistakenly believeThanksgiving to be, but a religious feast to give thanks to God for his ‘kindcare’ and ‘His Providence’ to the nation and its people. SubsequentlyWashington's 1789 proclamation was echoed by several other presidents.28[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1586]The notion that the United States of America has been somehow selected by Godfor special care is also expressed in the motto ‘In God We Trust’, introduced in1863 and approved to be stamped on 1 cent, 2 cents and 3 cents coins of thecurrency. Later in 1955 the motto was put on all currency coins and notes, andin July 1956 it was declared the official motto of the USA.Admittedly, the notion of a nation favoured by God in accordance with some greatdivine plan is nothing new. Throughout history it has been the norm for kingsand queens to believe that they had a divine right to rule and that theirnations were under special divine protection. Such ideas were so entrenched inthe European psyche that it literally took the beheading of King Louis XVI andQueen Marie-Antoinette of France to demonstrate to the masses that their rulerswere mortals who could be subjected to the same law as the lowliest citizens.Yet in America, despite the absence of a royal family, it seems that the conceptof ‘divine right’ has been entangled in politics from the very beginning, and,more recently – from the Arab and Muslim point of view at least – in foreignpolicy. Even though the US’s massive economic and military support for Israelmay not seem unusual or problematic to some Americans, the fact is that mostMuslims and Arabs see it as a ‘crusading alliance’ to retain the Holy Land underJudeo-Christian control. The more extreme Islamists, as we show in ChapterTwenty, go even further and characterise it as a ‘Masonic-Zionist alliance’.Now let's return to the ‘talisman’ of New York Harbor, that grand ‘LadyLiberty’, and see what else may be coaxed out of her …ANOTHER ANCIENT EGYPTIAN GODDESS LENDS HER SEVEN-POINTED STARIn view of the ‘Isis’ connection with Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty, we couldnot help noticing that there was something rather curious about the date of 5August which was chosen for the important cornerstone ceremony.Isis, we know, was identified with the star Sirius – a fact that was muchdiscussed at the time of Bartholdi in Masonic circles and, especially, in lodgesin France and the United States. In Chapter One we also saw that Sirius held aspecial fascination for French Freemasons and even more so for Masonicastronomers such as Lalande (who was a prominent member of the Franco-AmericanNine Sisters lodge in Paris). Lalande's interest had been focused on themystique surrounding the heliacal (dawn) rising of Sirius which, to Freemasons,evoked ideologies of spiritual ‘rebirth’ and the ‘raising’ of the initiated intothe mysteries.29 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1587] Given thatBartholdi was a Freemason, had travelled extensively in Egypt, had workedclosely with the Freemason Eiffel, had also been in close contact with Garibaldiand his ‘Egyptian’ type of Freemasonry, and had taken a keen interest in ancientEgyptian monuments, it would, we think, be perverse to imagine that he wouldhave been unfamiliar with the heliacal rising of Sirius and its intense‘rebirth’ symbolism. Indeed what better association than the heliacal rising ofthe star of Isis could be found to lock auspicious events in the sky to theconstruction on the ground of a ‘temple’ dedicated to freedom and intended toserve as the beacon of hope for a new life in a new land built on the loftyvirtues of Freemasonry?In the early days of ancient Egypt in the third millennium BC the heliacalrising of Sirius took place close to the summer solstice which (in our modern,‘Gregorian’ calendar) falls on 21 June. When Egypt became a Roman province in 30BC, however, the precession-cycle of our planet's axis had caused the heliacalrising of Sirius to ‘slip’ relative to the summer solstice so that it took placenearly one month later, that is around 20 July. When Bartholdi visited Egypt inthe 1860s, the heliacal rising of Sirius had slipped even further behind thesummer solstice, and from the latitude of ancient Heliopolis near Cairo wouldhave been observed on the morning of 5 August.30[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1588]Now it is a well-established fact that in ancient Egypt, the cornerstonelayingceremony of temples, known as the ‘stretching of the cord’, had been performedsince time immemorial by a priestess impersonating the goddess Seshat – whosesymbol was a seven-pointed star which she wore over her head. Seshat was knownas the ‘Lady of the Builders’, a title that established her as the protector oftemple-builders, architects and masons. Interestingly, she was also the wife ofThoth, the ancient Egyptian god of wisdom who provided the prototype of HermesTrismegistus – the much revered patron of esoteric and occult traditions,including Freemasonry. There is a very high probability that in ancient Egyptthe stretching-of-the-cord ceremony was performed at dawn at the time of theheliacal rising of Sirius.31 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1589]Considering this, and Seshat's seven-pointed-star headdress, we have to wonderat Bartholdi's decision to place a seven-pointed star over the head of hisstatue of ‘Liberty’, and also at the choice of 5 August for the statue'scornerstone ceremony.If we look even deeper into the symbolism that Bartholdi and others involvedmight have had in mind, the possibility must be considered that theseven-pointed star on the head of the Statue of Liberty is also there because ithas esoteric connotations and sinuous links to the Egyptian goddess Isis. Wehave already seen how Scottish Rite Freemasons, particularly in France,variously associated the symbolism of Tarot card XVI, known as the ‘Star’, withthe symbolism of the star of Isis i.e. Sirius. Is it not surprising, therefore,to discover that a seven-pointed star is often shown above the head of the womanwho features on this card pouring water out of jug into a river – surely a clearmetaphoric pictogram of the links between Isis, the star and the inundation ofthe Nile which took place at the heliacal rising of Sirius?The ‘Egyptian’ Freemasonry that Bartholdi was especially associated with wasintroduced to France by Cagliostro who created the famous ‘Isis’ lodge in Paris(see Chapter Sixteen). Egyptian Freemasonry was immensely popular in Alsace,where Cagliostro spent much time with the local Masons and where, in Strasbourg,he met and was sponsored by the Cardinal de Rohan. It comes as no surprise,therefore, that in his celebrated ‘Egyptian Rite’ Cagliostro was particularlyfascinated with the number seven which he directly equated with the ‘BlazingStar’ of the Masonic lodges and, consequently with the ‘star of Isis’ i.e.Sirius.32 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1590] And although theBlazing Star of the Freemasons is usually five pointed, Cagliostro insists thatthe Masons are mistaken, and that this symbol should have seven points, exactlyas seen on the head of the Statue of Liberty. When asked by one of his adeptsabout the meaning of the Blazing Star, Cagliostro replied:This star is the emblem of the Great mysteries revealed in supernaturalphilosophy and it is a new proof of the blindness and ignorance of modernMasons, because it ought to be terminated by 7 points or 7 angles, and you shallnever see it represented in any lodge except by 3, 5 or 6 angles …33[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1591]AN OBELISK FOR NEW YORKAt around the same time that the Statue of Liberty was being erected on Bedloe'sIsland an original ancient Egyptian obelisk was brought to New York's CentralPark. This obelisk, which bears inscriptions dedicated to Pharaoh Thutmosis III(1479 – 1425 BC), is one of a pair that originally stood at Heliopolis inancient times; the other stands today at London's Victoria Embankment. Theobelisk eventually destined for Central Park was brought from Heliopolis toAlexandria in 12 BC, during the reign of Augustus Caesar, to adorn the entranceof the Caesarium temple near the great eastern harbour, right opposite thePharos lighthouse on the northern side of the bay.34[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1592] And from there, after a furthereighteen centuries had passed, it was finally taken to New York.35[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1593]As was the case with the Statue of Liberty (as well as the ‘London Obelisk’),36[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1594] the whole complicated operationthat brought the ‘New York Obelisk’ to New York was Masonic through and through.The man with overall responsibility for the project, a naval engineer, HenryHonychurch Gorringe, was a staunch Freemason who had been initiated in New Yorkat the Anglo-Saxon Lodge No. 137.37[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1595] Indeed, even Dr. MartinaD’Alton, who wrote the official account of the New York Obelisk for theMetropolitan Museum of Art, could not avoid stating that:The Freemasons had a strong presence in New York. Almost to a man, all thoseinvolved in bringing [the obelisk] to America were members – Gorringe, Schoeder,Vanderbilt and Hurlbert, as well as the mayor, commissioner of police, andothers in city politics …38 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1596]It seems that the original idea of bringing an obelisk to New York had come fromthe Egyptian Khedive Isma'il himself. The occasion had been the inauguration ofthe Suez Canal in 1869. Finding himself next to William Hurlbert, the editor ofthe New York World newspaper, the khedive suddenly blurted out that he wouldlike to send an obelisk as a gift to the government of the United States.39[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1597] Hurlbert, a Freemason, wouldhave immediately recognised in this gesture a sort of polite ‘Masonic handshake’from the khedive, who also was a Freemason.40[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1598]Indeed, the Masonic influence went further than that. A few months before theopening of the Suez Canal, Khedive Isma'il's uncle, Prince Halim Pasha, had beenelected Grand Master of the Rite of Memphis, which practiced pseudo-Egyptianrituals using a system of ‘92 higher degrees’.41[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1599] Halim Pasha also served as theofficial Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Egypt.42[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1600]Gorringe arrived in Egypt in October 1879 with a Freemason colleague, LieutenantSeaton Schroeder, to take delivery of the obelisk. The khedive had entrustedSolutore Avventure Zola (who had replaced Prince Halim Pasha as Grand Master ofthe Rite of Memphis in 1874)43 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1601]with the task of handing over the gift to the Americans.44[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1602] It was reported at the timethat when Gorringe finally had the obelisk lowered onto the sandy beach atAlexandria, there was great excitement. The many Freemasons in the party hadnoticed ‘Masonic emblems’ – a trowel, a builder's square and an architect'striangle – carved into the base of the ancient pedestal.45[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1603] It seems that Gorringe was‘struck with the symbolism [and] decided to take the pedestal, steps, andfoundation to the New World and reposition them as they had been.’46[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1604]Perhaps we should mention as well that Gorringe had only a few years before been‘struck’ by something else. He was convinced that he had discovered ‘Atlantis’in the Azores while working with the United States Coast Survey in 1876 – a‘discovery’ which earned him a personal congratulatory message, no less, fromPresident Ulysses S. Grant.47 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1605]The obelisk finally reached New York and:On October 9th 1880, a parade of nine thousand Freemasons marched up FifthAvenue, bands blaring, to Greywacke Knoll for a grand and solemn cornerstoneceremony.48 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1606]The ceremony itself took place the next day, 10 October 1880, when Jesse B.Anthony, the Grand Master of the New York Masons, did the honours to ‘link theorigins of Freemasonry to ancient Egypt.’49[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1607]We spoke earlier of the George Washington Masonic Memorial in Alexandria,Virginia. In its case the ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone wasperformed in May 1923 by President Coolidge using the same trowel that GeorgeWashington himself had used 130 years earlier when he had laid the cornerstoneof the US Capitol in Washington, DC.50[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1608]The George Washington Masonic Memorial is thus the third of three significantMasonic monuments in the United States (the other two being the Statue ofLiberty and the New York Obelisk) which all exhibit intense symbolic links tothe ancient city of Alexandria in Egypt – a city which was universallyassociated in antiquity with the Pharos lighthouse and the goddess Isis-Pharia.PHILADELPHIA, THE ‘CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE’Although the foundation of Washington, DC took place in 1793, the city was notoccupied by the government until the end of President John Adams's term in 1801.During the two terms of George Washington's presidency, spanning the period from1789 to 1797, the seat of government, and thus the capital of the young UnitedStates, were located in the city of Philadelphia – a name that literally meansthe ‘City of Brotherly Love’ or, perhaps more appropriately, ‘City of the Loveof the Brotherhood’. This name, to say the very least, has a strong Masonic ringto it. But then that is hardly surprising when we realise, as we shall see laterin this chapter, that it was in Philadelphia that colonial Freemasonry firstflourished in the Americas.The story of Philadelphia, and its brief spell as the US’s first capital, is thestuff that Hollywood producers dream of. It all began in England in 1681, whenKing Charles II was confronted with an old and nagging debt due to a certainAdmiral William Penn and now payable to the admiral's son and heir, William.William Penn was the visionary leader of the Quakers – Christian nonconformistswho then happened to be causing a great deal of annoyance to the Church ofEngland. So Charles II, who was unwilling to meet his obligations to Penn incash, offered him instead a region in North America the size of England, oncondition that Penn use it to develop a province where Quakers and othernonconformists could enjoy ‘freedom of worship and self-government’. The namePennsylvania was chosen by King Charles II himself, and means ‘Forests of Penn’,apparently in honour of Admiral Penn, William's father.William Penn saw this, quite literally, as a God-sent opportunity to carry outwhat he called the ‘Holy Experiment’, and thus, to Charles II’s delight, gladlyaccepted the offer and challenge. Yet not in his wildest biblical dreams wouldPenn have imagined the final outcome. As for Charles II, he thought that he hadlumbered the irksome Quaker with a piece of useless real estate, not realising,of course, that he had in actual fact planted the seed of Britain's demise inthe American colonies.BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLONWilliam Penn set sail for America in early 1682, his thoughts filled with dreamsand visions of the great city he would found in the New World. Many contemporarydocuments show that Penn visualised what he constantly called ‘my Greene CountryTown’ modelled on his rural properties back in England. But according to one ofWilliam Penn's most distinguished biographers, Susan Coolidge:… the city of Babylon is said to have been in Penn's mind as a model for hisproposed city.51 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1609]Much suggests that Coolidge is correct. It is known, for example, that Penn, wasgreatly inspired by the idea of placing his city between two rivers, theDelaware and the Schuylkill, in much the same way that ancient Babylon had beensituated between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers. Another factor is theso-called gridiron layout adopted by Penn, which required an alignment ofparallel avenues running east-west and crisscrossing with another set of avenuesrunning north-south – a scheme that, according to some historians, wasapparently used for ancient Babylon.52[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1610] The third factor is, of course,the name that Penn chose for his city: Philadelphia, the ‘City of BrotherlyLove’, in which people of different races and languages would be re-united.In the Bible, Babylon was, of course, where the Tower of Babel had been builtunder Nimrod, when all men had spoken a single language. And for manyFreemasons, the Tower of Babel serves as the ultimate talisman or symbol oftheir origins. In his celebrated essay The Origins of Freemasonry, Thomas Paineexplained why:It is always understood that Freemasons have a secret which they carefullyconceal; but from everything that can be collected from their own accounts ofMasonry, their real secret is no other than their origin, which but few of themunderstand; and those who do, envelop it in mystery… In 1730, Samuel Pritchard,member of a constituted lodge in England, published a treatise entitled ‘MasonryDissected’; and made oath before the Lord Mayor of London that it was a truecopy: ‘Samuel Pritchard maketh oath that the copy hereunto annexed is a true andgenuine copy of every particular.’ In his work he has given the catechism orexamination, in question and answer, of the Apprentices, the Fellow Craft, andthe Master Mason. There was no difficulty in doing this, as it is mere form. Inhis introduction he says, ‘the original institution of Masonry consisted in thefoundation of the liberal arts and sciences, but more especially in geometry,for at the building of the Tower of Babel, the art and mystery of Masonry wasfirst introduced, and from thence handed down by Euclid, a worthy and excellentmathematician of the Egyptians; and he communicated it to Hiram, the MasterMason concerned in building Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem’.53[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1611]Thomas Paine correctly went on to point out that:Besides the absurdity of deriving Masonry from the building of Babel, where,according to the story, the confusion of languages prevented the buildersunderstanding each other, and consequently of communicating any knowledge theyhad, there is a glaring contradiction in point of chronology in the account hegives. Solomon's Temple was built and dedicated 1,004 years before the Christianera; and Euclid, as may be seen in the tables of chronology, lived 277 yearsbefore the same era. It was therefore impossible that Euclid could communicateanything to Hiram, since Euclid did not live till seven hundred years after thetime of Hiram.54 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1612]What Paine, a pragmatist, failed to understand is that English Freemasonry doesnot have a ‘history’ in the sense scholars understand the term, but rather a‘symbolic history’, where principles and ideologies of the Craft are elucidatedor ‘symbolised’ by biblical, mythical and even historical events such as thebuilding of Solomon's Temple and the Tower of Babel. To academic historians thissort of thing amounts to nothing more than pseudo-history – a yarn of absolutelyno historical value concocted to glorify particular individuals or cultures byassociating them with the biblical story. But Freemasons know better. Symbolichistory – even though false or, at best, grossly distorted and exaggerated – isto be valued in itself for its effects on society and on mass human behaviour.Within William Penn's vision of a ‘New Babylon’ between the rivers of the NewWorld, was also a vision of a Mesopotamian-style ‘Garden of Eden’, whereby ahuge area of 10,000 acres – of which 1,200 were reserved for Philadelphia – wasto be developed in Penn's curious concept of a ‘Greene Country Towne’ with its‘gridiron’ system of intersecting avenues. In this biblical ‘theme park’ eachcitizen would be allocated ‘sizable areas of green’. Eighty acres in the centreof Philadelphia were specifically reserved for ‘gentlemen's estates’ withmansions set at least 800 feet apart from each other separated by lavish gardensand fields. The wide streets of the gridiron crisscrossed in perfect rectangularsymmetry, and at each corner of the citycentre were ‘squares’ – forerunners oftoday's urban parks. In their midst was a fifth, larger ‘square’, with a wideavenue radiating from each side to form a giant croisée or ‘cross’.The whole city was circumscribed within a gigantic rectangle whose longer sideran east-west. Oddly, however, this great rectangle was not perfectly orientedto the astronomical cardinal directions (i.e. due north, south, east and west)but was instead fixed about 10° south-of-east. This may have been to keep thelayout more or less parallel to the adjacent rivers. But a more esoteric purposeis by no means out of the question in such a ‘City of Brotherly Love’. We notewith interest, therefore, that the Sun aligns itself at rising with the axis ofPhiladelphia on two days of the year: 16 February and 13 October.55[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1613] The latter date marks theanniversary of the suppression of the Knights Templar which took place, as wesaw in Chapter Fifteen, on 13 October 1307. Whether by accident or by design, aswe will show later, the same date of 13 October also crops up in connection withthe cornerstone ceremony of the White House in Washington, DC.Penn entrusted the design of Philadelphia to Thomas Holme, an accomplished urbanarchitect, who published Penn's scheme in 1683.56[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1614] Copies of Holme's design havesurvived, and the ‘gridiron’ principle can clearly be seen, with its fourcorners and central ‘squares’. It was perhaps appropriate that such ageometrical city should not only serve as the capital of the newly-formed UnitedStates of America for the twelve years from 1789 to 1801, but should also havebecome the ‘capital’ of American Freemasonry. Today about 25 ‘Masonicallyrelated sites’ are recognised in Philadelphia, not least the great MasonicTemple on Broad Street with it ‘Egyptian’ and ‘Solomonic’ rooms. On Fifth andArch Street stands the Free Quaker Meeting House; it served as the Masonic GrandLodge of Pennsylvania in the crucial years between 1775 – 1777. And let's notforget the National Memorial Arch dedicated to ‘Brother’ George Washington(rebuilt by the Freemasons of Pennsylvania in 1996).57[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1615]Such roots go deep. Just 40 years after William Penn's arrival in the New World,the utopian city that he created was to become the home of America's firstFreemasons …But before we investigate the intense Masonic character of the early history ofthe city of Philadelphia, it is worth emphasising that the idea of imbuingMasonic ideas and symbolism into the plans of a city is by no means fancifulthinking – as we will see in this ‘brief deviation’ …A BRIEF DEVIATION: KILBOURNE PLATThe surveyor Hector Kilbourne was responsible for designing the original plan ofthe city of Sandusky, Ohio (and in 1819 became the first Master of the ScienceLodge No. 50, the first Masonic lodge in Sandusky). Being a Freemason, Kilbournedecided to integrate the ‘square and compass’, the best-known Masonic symbol,into the layout of the streets in the central downtown area now known asKilbourne Plat. There can be absolutely no doubt that this was his intention, asnot only one can very obviously discern the famous Masonic symbol in theoriginal city plan, but just outside the city has been placed an ‘historicalmarker’ in the form of a large bronze plaque by the Ohio Historical Societywhich reads:Hector Kilbourne, a Freemason and the surveyor who made the original plat ofSandusky (as Portland) in 1816, laid out the streets to form the Masonic emblem.Huron and Central Avenues are the arms of the compass. Elm and Poplar Streetsthe sides of the Mason's square. The first Masonic Lodge was founded in Sanduskyin 1819, with Kilbourne as Master. The 29 Lodges of the 16th District, Grand Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons ofOhio, Crawford, Erie, Huron, Seneca, and Wyandot Counties and The OhioHistorical Society58 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1616]Considering that this Masonic city design was hatched so soon after the designof Washington, DC in 1791, we feel entirely justified in looking for similar‘Masonic’ influences in other major American cities which played a key role inthe events that led to the creation of the USA.THE CANDLE-MAKER'S SONBy the final quarter of the 18th century Philadelphia had grown to become thesecond largest English-speaking city in the world after London. And is its nameimplied its local culture was intensely Masonic. At the same time it was a richcommercial centre which, in direct contrast to its proclaimed ‘brotherly love’,was heavily engaged in the black slave trade. Tradition has it that it was inthe city of Philadelphia that the first Masonic lodge in America wasconsecrated, the St. John's No. 1 Lodge.59[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1617] It was also in Philadelphiathat the most renowned of all American Freemasons, Benjamin Franklin, receivedhis initiation.60 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1618]Born the son of a candle-maker in Boston, Benjamin Franklin left his home townin 1723 after losing his job because of the political tone of articles he hadwritten for his brother's newspaper, the New-England Courant. The young Franklinsettled in Philadelphia where he was encouraged by William Keith, the governorof Pennsylvania, to set himself up in the publishing trade. To this end, he wassponsored by Keith to go to England in order to acquire experience in thepublishing business. Franklin stayed in London from 1724 to 1726 then returnedto Philadelphia where he eventually founded the Pennsylvania Gazette. This wasthe newspaper in which appeared the first published commentary on Freemasonry inAmerica.61 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1619]In 1730 Franklin was made a Freemason at the St. John's lodge in Philadelphia,and by 1734 became its Grand Master.62[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1620] From 1737 to 1753 Franklin wasin charge of the Philadelphia post office. A deist and preacher of religioustolerance, Franklin was also a scientist and, in 1751, gained fame and notorietywhen he invented the lightning conductor after flying a kite in a thunderstorm.Franklin revisited England between 1757 and 1762, this time as therepresentative of the colony of Pennsylvania. He was to return again two yearslater, staying until 1775. During this last sojourn in London, Franklin enteredinto lengthy negotiations with the British government, and was instrumental intoppling the Stamp Act imposed by the British Parliament on the Americancolonies. As such, Franklin sowed the political and intellectual seeds thatwould lead to open opposition against the British in America and, ultimately, tothe War of Independence. In 1775, when he heard that the colonists werepreparing for an armed uprising against the British, Franklin felt that hisposition in England was becoming too dangerous and so made his way back acrossthe Atlantic. He arrived in Philadelphia in May 1775, just two weeks after thefirst shots were fired against the British at Lexington. In June theRevolutionary army confronted the British forces at Bunker Hill, marking thebeginning of a full-scale war.THOMAS PAINEIt was from Philadelphia, too, that another popular journalist, Thomas Paine, aQuaker and staunch deist, began a violent attack on the British in his writings.Paine was born in Norfolk, England, and was the son of a Quaker andcorset-maker. After repeated failures to forge a career, his luck began to turnwhen he met Benjamin Franklin in London in the early 1770s. Franklin advised himto seek his fortune in America and provided him with letters of recommendation.Paine arrived in Philadelphia in 1774 and two years later, in January 1776,published his celebrated pamphlet Common Sense, in which he put forward thenotion of a ‘Declaration of Independence’. It sold over half a million copiesand some even believe it served as the basis of the formal Declaration ofIndependence that was eventually compiled by Thomas Jefferson in July 1776.Aside from his great political impact, Paine is known in Masonic circles forpromoting the same idea as the British archaeologist (and fellow and councilmember of the Royal Society), the Freemason William Stukeley – who claimed thatFreemasonry took its rituals from the ancient Druids who, in turn, had inheritedthem from the ancient Egyptians.63[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1621] In an article on this subjectPaine informs us of his view that ‘the ancient Druids … like the Magi of Persiaand the priests of Heliopolis in Egypt, were priests of the Sun’. Paine goes onto say:The Christian religion and Masonry have one and the same common origin: both arederived from the worship of the Sun. The difference between their origins isthat the Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the Sun … And in whatperiod of antiquity or in what nation this religion was first established, islost in the labyrinth of unrecorded time. It is generally ascribed to theancient Egyptians … The religion of the Druids, as before said, was the same asthe religion of the ancient Egyptians. The Priests of Egypt were the professorsand teachers of science, and were styled priests of Heliopolis, that is of theCity of the Sun …64 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1622]In the same article, Paine supports his own claims by quoting Captain GeorgeSmith, inspector of the Royal Artillery Academy at Woolwich and Provincial GrandMaster of Masonry in Kent, who had asserted that:Egypt, from whence we derive many of our mysteries, has always borne adistinguished rank in history, and was once celebrated above all others for itsantiquities, learning, opulence and fertility. In their system, their principalhero-gods, Osiris and Isis, theologically represented the Supreme Being andUniversal Nature … The Egyptians in the earliest ages constituted a great numberof Lodges, but with assiduous care kept their secrets of Masonry from allstrangers. These secrets have been imperfectly handed down to us by oraltraditions only, and ought to be kept undiscovered to the labourers, craftsmenand apprentices, till by good behaviour and long study they become betteracquainted in geometry and the liberal arts, and thereby qualified for Mastersand Wardens …65 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1623]We shall see later how Thomas Paine went to Paris during the French Revolutionand befriended the astronomer Charles-François Dupuis who, as we shall recall,was an advocate of the view that the city of Paris owed its origins to theEgyptian goddess Isis. We shall also see how Paine developed a close friendshipwith the writer Nicolas de Bonneville, a Freemason, mystic and radicalrevolutionary, and with the mathematician and philosopher, the Marquis deCondorcet, likewise a revolutionary and a member of the Nine Sisters lodge.66[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1624] Paine, who was to arrive inParis at the height of Robespierre's reign, may have played a part in theattempt to induce the populace of Paris to adopt the new republican Cult of theSupreme Being, and perhaps even the cult of Nature-Reason-Liberty which wasflaunted as a pseudo-Isis cult at the Place de la Bastille in August 1793 …FRANKLIN IN FRANCEWe saw in Chapter One that in late 1776, thirteen years before the FrenchRevolution broke out, Benjamin Franklin was sent to France to serve as the firstambassador of the newly formed Republic of the United States. Being the mostsenior of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, and also theinventor of the lightning rod, Franklin's huge fame had preceded him, and he wasnow hailed as a sort of cult hero upon his arrival in Paris. His primary missionwas to gain support, both financial and militarily, for the American war againstthe British. This he succeeded in doing, largely through complexbehind-the-scenes negotiations with Charles Gravier, the Count of Vergennes,Louis XVI’s minister of foreign affairs.Witty and wise, Franklin was taken by the pre-revolutionary French as a symbolof ‘liberty in the New World’. He was the hero who opposed the British – and, byextension, the oppression and despotism of European monarchs in general. He wasquickly to become the darling of the social salons in Paris and, invariably, thefavourite of the elitist Masonic lodges. As we also saw in Chapter One, Franklinjoined the famous Nine Sisters lodge while he was ambassador in Paris and, in1777, was to become its Grand Master.The Nine Sisters lodge was the natural successor of an older lodge, LesSciences, founded in 1766 by the astronomer Jérôme Lalande and the philosopherand atheist, Claude Adrien Helvétius. In 1771, after the death of Helvétius,Lalande and Helvétius's widow, Mme Anne Catherine Helvétius, were instrumentalin the founding of the Nine Sisters lodge. Mme Helvétius ran the famous elitistsalon in the Rue Sainte-Anne in Paris, which was renowned throughout Europe forthe intellectual excellence of its members.67[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1625] She also hosted another salonat Auteuil near Paris, which maintained very close links with the Nine Sisterslodge.68 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1626]Franklin was a regular visitor to Mme Helvétius's salons, and so was the Marquisde Lafayette, who was then a young officer in the French army. Lafayette wasalso a member of the lodge, Le Contrat Social, itself linked to elitist lodgessuch as the Société Olympique whose members included other young officers, amongthem the Count de Chambrun, the Count-Admiral de Grasse, the Count-Admirald’Estaing and the famous ‘buccaneer’ John Paul Jones. All these men would playimportant roles later in America in the War of Independence. Indeed it wasalmost certainly through these Masonic lodges and salons that Franklin'spolitical and commercial agent in Paris, the American Silas Deane, recruitedyoung French officers to help George Washington fight the British. One suchofficer recruited by Deane, probably through the intermediary of PierreBeaumarchais, was the Marquis de Lafayette, who was only 19 years old at thetime.69 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1627]‘WHY NOT?’The importance of Lafayette in the American Revolution cannot be overstated.Indeed, many Americans today believe that were it not for Lafayette, Washingtonmight have been unable to muster enough military support to defeat the British.Many have also wondered what prompted Lafayette to make such great personalsacrifices for the cause of America. Part of the answer can be found in themotto that he chose for his coat-of-arms: Cur Non?, (‘Why Not?’).70[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1628] These two simple words perhapsreveal better than anything else the character of this enterprising andimmensely courageous man.Lafayette, whose full name was Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier,was born on 6 September 1757 in Chavaniac, in the Haute-Loire in France. Hisfather, an important general in the army, was killed in battle when Lafayettewas only two years old, and his mother was to die eleven years later, leavingthe adolescent Lafayette as the sole beneficiary of a huge fortune. True to hisdescent from a distinguished military family, he enrolled to study at themilitary academy in Versailles and by the age of 16 became a captain in theDragoon guards of Louis XVI. At 19 he was introduced to the American agent SilasDeane who, thinking that Lafayette's influential position and financial fortunecould be of great use to the American cause, immediately commissioned the youngofficer to join Washington's Revolutionary army in the colonies.Lafayette was from the old nobility of France and enjoyed additional connectionsthrough his marriage. His father-in-law was the Duke of Ayen, who came from oneof the country's wealthiest and most influential families, the Noailles. TheDuke of Ayen's father and also his grandfather had held the highest militarytitle, that of Maréchal de France (‘Marshal of France’), and the Duke himselfwas the captain of Louis XVI’s bodyguards. The Duke's brother, the Count ofNoailles, was the French ambassador to England. Not surprisingly, in his letterof recommendation to the American Congress, Silas Deane described Lafayette asbeing ‘of the first family and fortune [who] … will do us infinite service’. Heurged that ‘a generous reception’ be prepared for this young and dashingfigurehead upon his arrival in America.Fired by the excitement of defending ‘Liberty’ in the New Word, and hungry formilitary glory, Lafayette used his own money to purchase a ship, La Victoire, inorder to sail to America with his companions. All this was done in secrecy, forLafayette had not been granted the required permission from Louis XVI, nor hadhe received the approval of his powerful and influential father-in-law. However,the Atlantic crossing of La Victoire went without too much trouble, andLafayette and his team arrived in Georgetown, South Carolina in mid-June 1777.He and six of his companions then made their way inland to Philadelphia, only tofind Congress reluctant to endorse the military commissions they had receivedfrom Silas Deane in France. But in a passionate speech, Lafayette managed topersuade the congressmen that he would use his own funds and resources.Impressed with such zeal and commitment to their cause, Congress finally agreedto ratify his appointment and, a fortnight later, he was sent to the generalquarters of George Washington north of Philadelphia. Legend has it that both mentook to each other like brothers. Later, after the war, when Lafayette hadreturned to France, Washington was to write to him these famous words:Whether you come here in the character of commanding officer of a corps ofgallant French, should circumstances lead to that event; whether as an Americanmajor general you come to retake command of a division of our army; or whetherafter the peace you come to see me simply as my friend and my companion, I shallreceive you in every case with all the tenderness of a brother.71[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1629]In September 1777, riding at the side of Washington, Lafayette fought bravelyagainst the British at the Battle of Brandywine. Wounded, Lafayette wasevacuated to Philadelphia, and there witnessed the fall of the city to theBritish. He was to distinguish himself brilliantly at the Battle of Barren Hillseven months later. All in all Lafayette proved to be a superb officer in thefield, and a wise advisor to Washington. His deep friendship with the futurefirst president of the United States, who was 25 years his senior, turned toalmost filial adoration. It was, however, Lafayette's catalytic role in therelationship between France and America, and his influence in persuading Franceto sign a treaty of alliance with Congress against the British early in 1778,that made him a crucial player in the War of Independence.In 1781 he fought at Washington's side in the decisive Battle of Yorktown, andhis brilliant actions largely contributed to the routing of British forces andtheir surrender to Washington. Now at 24, barely four years after he had arrivedin America, the young and debonair Marquis de Lafayette was hailed as ‘Hero ofthe Two Worlds’ (as Garibaldi would be later) i.e. a hero on both sides of theAtlantic. The huge and lasting impression that Lafayette has had on the Americanpeople can be witnessed today with the hundreds of public places and streetsthat bear his name, including a whole county in Pennsylvania. When 42 yearslater, in 1824, Lafayette, by now a 33rd degree Freemason, visited Americaagain, he was received as a national hero.The immense and enduring sense of gratitude of the American people towards thisremarkable Frenchman is immortalised in the words of Colonel Charles E. Stantonon behalf of General John J. Pershing, a 33rd degree Freemason, after theliberation of Paris in 1917: ‘Lafayette, we are here!’Stanton pronounced this ‘brotherly homage’ on 4 July, Independence Day, in thepresence of hundreds of Freemasons in front of the tomb of Lafayette at thePicpus Cemetery in Paris.72 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1630]THE HOUSE OF THE TEMPLEThe 33rd degree system is regulated by the Supreme Council, 33°, Ancient andAccepted Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, USA. This elitist Masonic order,with its many ostentatious titles and impressive grades, seems to hold a strongappeal for high-ranking military men and for up-and-coming politicians. Todaythere are about 40 supreme councils as well as four national lodges around theworld, all of which fall under the informal authority of this so-called MotherSupreme Council.The Mother Supreme Council now has its headquarters in Washington, DC, locatedat 1733 16th Street, NW. Known as the ‘House of the Temple’, this imposing,neo-classical building is modelled on the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, and wasdesigned in 1911 by the famous architect and Freemason John Russell Pope. At theentrance are two imposing ‘Egyptian’ sphinxes symbolising ‘wisdom’ and‘power’.73 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1631] The ‘wisdom’ sphinxhas on its breast an image of an Egyptian goddess, probably Isis, and the‘power’ sphinx has the ancient Egyptian Ankh, the so-called key of life, as wellas the uraeus symbol designating the solar pedigree of the pharaohs.The great door knob of the main entrance of the Supreme Council in Washington,DC is in the shape of a solar-lion, and inside the atrium, which is veryreminiscent of an Egyptian temple, are two ‘Egyptian’ statues of seated scribesplaced at the foot of a large ceremonial staircase. Each of these statuescarries a hieroglyphic inscription which translates as ‘Established to the Gloryof God’ and a dedication ‘to the teaching of wisdom to those men working to makea strong nation.’ The staircase leads to a bronze bust of Albert Pike, the mostfamous of all Scottish Rite Grand Masters to whom the ‘House of the Temple’ isdedicated. A plaque above the bust of Pike reads: ‘What we have done forourselves alone dies with us: What we have done for others and the world remainsand is immortal.’Another imposing pseudo-Egyptian motif in the Supreme Council in Washington, DCis the winged glowing triangle that hangs over the altar in the main room of thetemple as well as on the ceiling. This is a motif which is, of course, modelledon the winged solar disc common to all ancient Egyptian temples. But moreintriguing is the fact that it was Albert Pike himself who confirmed that theso-called Blazing Star that is often seen at the entrance of Masonic lodges, orassociated with the Masonic glowing triangle, is none other than the star ofIsis, Sirius:The Ancient Astronomers saw all the great symbols of Masonry in the stars.Sirius still glitters in our lodges as the Blazing Star …74[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1632] [This star is] an emblem of the Divine Truth, given by God to the first men, andpreserved amid all the vicissitudes of ages in the traditions and teachings ofMasonry.75 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1633] The Blazing Star in our Lodges, we have already said, represent Sirius, Anubis,or Mercury, Guardian and Guide of Souls.76[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1634] The Blazing Star or Glory in the centre refers us to that Grand Luminary theSun, which enlightens the Earth, and by its genial influence dispenses blessingsto mankind.77 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1635] The Blazing Star has been regarded as an emblem of Omniscience, or theAll-Seeing-Eye, which to the Ancients was the Sun.78[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1636] He was Sirius or the Dog-Star, the friend and counsellor of Osiris, and theinventor of language, grammar, astronomy, surveying, arithmetic, music, andmedical science; the first maker of laws; and who taught the worship of theGods, and the building of temples.79[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1637]When coupled with the claims of Albert Pike regarding Sirius, the star of Isis,the intense pseudo-Egyptian quality of the House of the Temple in Washington,DC, especially the two sphinxes guarding the entrance, immediately brings tomind the two sphinxes and the Isis statue that were designed by Jacques-LouisDavid for the 1793 celebrations at the Place de la Bastille in Paris, as well asPicot's painting in the Louvre.Before we examine this curious link further we need to know more about AlbertPike, and why the Washington, DC ‘House of the Temple’ was dedicated to him …THE BLAZING STARAlbert Pike is often described by Scottish Rite Freemasons as a poet, trapper,historian, revolutionary, lawyer, politician, army commander, orator, author andphilosopher. In short, the Renaissance man par excellence. Born in Boston in1809, he went to Harvard but dropped out to become a school teacher. He thenbecame a trapper in Arkansas in 1831 but later was somehow admitted to the barof the Supreme Court. He eventually moved to New Orleans to practice law, thenjoined the side of the South during the Civil War and was appointed aConfederate commissioner commander, leading Indian tribes. He wascourt-martialed on dubious charges of fraud, acquitted, and finally opened a lawoffice in Washington, DC.Pike is best remembered not so much for his colourful career but for havingrevived the Scottish Rite when he became the Grand Commander of this Masonicorder in 1859. He has been dubbed the most ‘famous (or infamous as the case maybe) Freemason of his times’. He died peacefully in April 1891 while working athis desk at the Scottish Rite Temple in Washington, DC. Ironically, most ofthose who become Freemasons today know little, if anything, about him.Pike joined Freemasonry in 1850 at the Western Star Lodge No. 2, Little Rock,Arkansas, and became a Master Mason in November that same year. In 1859, thus inless than a decade, he rose to the position of Sovereign Grand Master of theSupreme Council, 33°, of the Scottish Rite in the United States and, bydefinition, the whole world. When Pike joined the Scottish Rite he found theorder in tatters, but by the end of his life ‘he left it a stately temple to thedignity and rights of man’ and made it the ‘single most influential body ofFreemasonry in the world.’80 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1638]His first big task in this amazing reformation of the Scottish Rite was torewrite and formalise the 33 degree rituals which had much degraded over theyears. He then set about the task of providing a ‘foundation literature’ for theScottish Rite, which entailed writing an opus of 860 pages entitled Morals andDogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, first publishedby the Scottish Rite Press in 1871.81[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1639] This huge and somewhat bafflingbook was based on a series of lectures Pike had given, and is divided into 32chapters to cover all the degrees except the last – the 33rd – which is not adegree as such, but more of a title.It becomes evident on studying this book that Pike must have conducted anextensive investigation of comparative religion, Cabala, Hermeticism, mysticism,mythology, symbolism and speculative philosophy in general. For the first 60years or so after it was published, Morals and Dogma, as it is known for short,was compulsory reading for all who joined the Scottish Rite. Yet in spite of itstitle, the book is not a Masonic manifesto at all, but rather an attempt toprovide a historic and mythological framework for Scottish Rite Freemasons. Pikehimself made it clear to his readers that they were free to accept or rejectwhat he had written, although his immense reputation at the time meant that hisresearch tended to be accepted without question. Besides, as one modern Masonicwriter so correctly remarks about similar dubious historical claims, ‘whether itis true is not the point; the point is that it is claimed to be true.’82[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1640]It was in Morals and Dogma that Pike made the association between the Masonicfive-pointed ‘Blazing Star’ and the Egyptian star of Isis, Sirius, which is alsooften depicted as a five-pointed star. Pike strongly opposed the idea held atthe time by some Masons that the Blazing Star represents the ‘star of the East’i.e. the star of Bethlehem:To find in the Blazing Star of five points an allusion to Divine Providence isalso fanciful; and to make it commemorative of the Star that is said to haveguided the Magi is to give it a meaning comparatively modern. Originally, itrepresented SIRIUS, or the Dog Star.83[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1641]This was not the first time that Sirius had been equated with a Blazing Star. InHomer's Iliad (circa 800 BC) the wrath of the hero Achilles is described as the:… blazing star that comes forth at harvest-time, shining forth amid the host ofstars in the darkness of the night, the star whose name men call Orion's Dog[Sirius].84 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1642]We also find in Appolonius Rhodius's Argonautica that ‘the Dog-star Sirius wasscorching the Minoan Islands from the sky’ Similarly there is a reference in thesame text to ‘Sirius rising from Okeanos [Oceanus], brilliant and beautiful butfull of menace for the flocks.’85[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1643] Aratus speaks of ‘a star thatkeenest of all blazes with a searing flame and him men call Sirius.’86[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1644] Finally Manilius referred toSirius as ‘the dog with the blazing face.’So, whatever his faults, it seems that Albert Pike was a very meticulousscholar, and there can be little doubt that he consulted all these classicalsources during his research for Morals and Dogma. Indeed, it is known that hehad taught himself Latin, Greek and Sanskrit in order to study such ancienttexts. We must also conclude that if Pike could easily make the obvious linkbetween the Masonic ‘Blazing Star’ and Sirius, then quite clearly other educatedMasons could have arrived at the same conclusion.Did they?THOMAS PAINE'S SUPREME BEINGIn 1782, after the surrender of the British at Yorktown, the Marquis deLafayette returned to France to a huge hero's welcome. He was now ranked as aMaréchal de Camp, and served for a while as a diplomatic aide to BenjaminFranklin in Paris. In 1784 Franklin was joined by Thomas Jefferson, the newambassador of the United States. In the same year Lafayette went on tour inGermany and met Frederick the Great. Meanwhile Thomas Paine was still in theUnited States, now poverty stricken and devoting his time to odd ventures likeinventing the smokeless candle and designing a pierless iron bridge for theSchuylkill River near Philadelphia.87[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1645]Benjamin Franklin had been raised to the position of Grand Master of the NineSisters lodge in Paris seven years earlier, and had developed a large network ofcontacts in France and elsewhere in Europe. It is not so clear whether ThomasJefferson was a Freemason but as James W. Beless, a 33rd degree Mason with aninterest in this question, so aptly put it: ‘Jefferson may not have been acard-carrying Mason, but his philosophy and actions certainly paralleled Masonicideals and practices.’88 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1646] Areport from Dr. Guillotin, a member of the Nine Sisters lodge at the time whenJefferson was in Paris, confirms that Jefferson visited this lodge at leastonce.89 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1647] There is also no doubtthat Jefferson was often surrounded by prominent and very active Masons.According to Beless:His son-in-law, Governor of Virginia Thomas M. Randolph, his favourite grandson,Thomas Jefferson Randolph, and nephews Peter and Samuel Carr were all members ofDoor to Virtue Lodge No. 44, Albemarle County, Virginia. Freemasons such asThomas Paine, Voltaire, Lafayette and Jean Houdon were some of his closestassociates in Europe. Masons whom he admired in America included GeorgeWashington, Benjamin Franklin, Dr. Benjamin Rush, John Paul Jones, JamesMadison, James Monroe, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark … He had marched inMasonic procession with Widow's Son Lodge No. 60 and Charlottesville Lodge No.90 on October 6, 1817, at the cornerstone laying of Central College (now theUniversity of Virginia) … The Grand Lodges of South Carolina and Louisiana heldfuneral orations and processions for him following his death on July 4, 1826 and… a Blue Lodge at Surrey Court House, Virginia, was named Jefferson Lodge No. 65in 1801.90 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1648]While Jefferson was still in Paris, Paine returned to Europe in 1787. He firstwent to London where he hoped to get support for his iron bridge project. Butafter the fall of the Bastille in July 1789 he became interested in the FrenchRevolution and began a regular correspondence with Jefferson in Paris.In spring 1790 Paine travelled to Paris to advise Lafayette on constitutionalmatters, and during this first visit Lafayette presented him with the key of the(now nearly demolished) Bastille.91[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1649] On the same trip, Paine madecontact with the Freemason and writer Nicolas de Bonneville, who, with the AbbéFauchet, had recently founded the so-called Cercle Social (the ‘Social Circle’),a radical literary group that promoted deism and republican virtues and ideals.Later, in 1812, Nicolas de Bonneville would translate Thomas Paine's Origins ofFreemasonry into French. In this work, Paine argues that the ancient Egyptiancult of the Sun and of Osiris are at the root of Masonic rituals.92[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1650]Among Paine's other Parisian friends and supporters was the Marquis deCondorcet, also a Freemason and a friend of Voltaire. A renowned mathematicianas well as champion of human rights, Condorcet was a member of the Nine Sisterslodge – where fellow members included Benjamin Franklin, the occultist andinventor of the Tarot, Court de Gébelin, and the astronomer Lalande. Let usrecall in passing that it was Court de Gébelin who, in 1781, had written in hiscelebrated book, Le Monde Primitif analysé et comparé avec le monde moderne,that:No one ignores that Paris was originally enclosed in the island [the Île de laCité]. It was thus, since its origins, a city of navigation … As it was in ariver rife with navigation, it took as its symbol a boat, and as tutelarygoddess, Isis, goddess of navigation; and this boat was the actual one of Isis,symbol of this goddess.93 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1651]The reader will recall from Chapter Seventeen that Court de Gébelin, whobelonged to the ‘Scottish Rite’ and ‘Templar’ Freemasonry, had met the famousCagliostro, inventor of ‘Egyptian’ Freemasonry, and admitted himself notqualified ‘to interrogate a man so much his superior in every branch oflearning’.94 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1652]It was Court de Gébelin who, along with Franklin, was given the ultimate honourof escorting Voltaire during the latter's Masonic initiation at the Nine Sisterslodge in 1778. Why, out of all the many illustrious members available, was Courtde Gébelin selected to officiate in this most historic of initiations? Thereason, we suspect, may well be in the alleged connection linking the ScottishRite's ‘degrees’, the Tarot's ‘cards’ and the Cabalistic ‘paths’ – with thenumber 32 being the mystical common denominator for all three.We saw in Chapter Fifteen, that the 33rd degree Scottish Rite author CharlesSunmer Lobingier, historian for the Grand Commandery of the Scottish Rite inWashington, DC, deduced that in the Cabala's 32 paths of wisdom95[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1653] ‘we doubtless have the originof the number of degrees as formulated by the Grand Constitution’ of theScottish Rite.96 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1654] It is wellknown that the modern esoteric Tarot is largely modelled on the ideologies ofthe Cabala and the Cabalistic Sephiroth. Even more interestingly in thiscontext, we may recall that it was Court de Gébelin himself who had attributedto the Tarot an ‘Egyptian origin’ and furthermore had asserted that theso-called Star in the Tarot deck was none other than the star of Isis, Sirius.And even though Thomas Paine could not have met Court de Gébelin (the latterdied several years before Paine came to Paris) all this goes to show the potentbrew of Cabalistic and Hermetic ideologies that was bubbling amongst Paine'scircle of friends in Paris at the precise time that he was preparing to publishhis celebrated Rights of Man.In early May 1790 Paine returned to London just as Edmund Burke published hisReflections on the French Revolution – a broadside attack on the uprising of theFrench people against the monarchy. Paine's outraged response was his celebratedRights of Man, the first part of which he wrote and rushed into print beforegoing back to Paris in early 1791 to establish the first ‘republican’ club thereand to write his Republican Manifesto. By July 1791 the energetic Paine was onceagain in London where he wrote the second part of Rights of Man and dedicated itto Lafayette.97 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1655]It was during his visits to Paris that Paine met Thomas Jefferson who wouldbecome his friend and confidante.98[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1656] Meanwhile in London hefrequented an elite group of radical thinkers including the famous English poetWilliam Blake. For all these radical intellectuals, as Professor David Cody hasshown, the French Revolution in its early stages:… portrayed itself as a triumph of the forces of reason over those ofsuperstition and privilege … [and] as a symbolic act which presaged the returnof humanity to the state of perfection from which it had fallen away.99[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1657]Not unexpectedly Thomas Paine's Rights of Man was immediately banned by theBritish government and, rather disturbingly, effigies of Paine were burntoutside churches. Paine himself was indicted for ‘seditious libel’ which, inthose dangerous days, carried the death penalty. He narrowly managed to escapearrest, however, through the timely intervention of his good friend, WilliamBlake, who warned Paine not to return to his home and helped him fleeimmediately to France.Upon arriving in Paris, Paine was hailed as a hero and friend of therevolutionaries and was promptly given honorary French citizenship and made amember of the National Assembly. But being a pacifist, Paine opposed the deathpenalty for Louis XVI and instead voted that the king be exiled. This stanceinfuriated the zealous Robespierre who had Paine thrown into prison in the oldLuxembourg Palace. While incarcerated there, Paine managed to arrange for thepublication of the first part of his most famous work, The Age of Reason.In Age of Reason Paine makes clear that he was a deist and believed in a SupremeBeing while opposing the established Church. Naturally he must have been awarethat at precisely this time, Robespierre and Jacques-Louis David were pressingon with their own cults of ‘Reason’ and the ‘Supreme Being’. And we know that‘Reason’ and ‘Liberty’ – in the mind of at least David – were personified as theEgyptian goddess Isis during that strange ceremony that took place at theBastille on 10 August 1793. In consideration of Paine's keen interest in Masonicorigins, and his belief that Freemasonry owed its rituals to the Druids and theancient Egyptians, it is not impossible that the personification of Paine's‘Reason’ might also have veiled the same ancient goddess of the Nile …On 18 September 1793, barely five weeks after the ‘Isis’ ceremony in Paris,another republican ceremony was about to take place on the other side of theAtlantic on the summit of a low hill overlooking the Potomac River. But thistime it was not to celebrate the demolition of a vilified national monument likethe Bastille but rather to lay the cornerstone of a great ‘Temple of Liberty’that would be built here – the brainchild of yet another adventurous Frenchman,Pierre-Charles L’Enfant.ENGINEER, ARTIST, SOLDIEROn a warm and bright spring day in April 1909, D. H. Rhodes, the depotquartermaster of Digges Farm near Washington, DC, with the commissioners of theDistrict of Columbia all present, supervised the disinterment of the remains ofa man who had died 84 years previously, in 1825. The pitiful remains were gentlygathered and placed in a metal-lined casket which was then covered with theAmerican flag and taken to the Mount Olive Cemetery. Early in the morning of 28April the casket was moved to the Capitol where it lay in solemn state untilnoon. Then, under military escort, it was finally taken to Arlington NationalCemetery and buried in a permanent grave on sloping ground in front of theCustis-Lee Mansion and overlooking, in the distance, the city of Washington. Asum of $1,000 was allocated by Congress to erect a monument over the grave,featuring the street plan of the Federal City. Below the plan the name of thedeceased may also be seen: Pierre-Charles L’Enfant, engineer, artist, soldier.Pierre-Charles L’Enfant was born in Paris in 1754, the son of a painter oflandscapes and battle-scenes.100[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1658] Like his father before him, theyoung L’Enfant was educated at France's Académie Royale de Peinture et deSculpture. There he learnt how to design military fortifications. He alsostudied the science of landscapes from the works of André Le Nôtre who, acentury earlier, had designed the Tuileries Garden and the great Historical Axisof Paris. L’Enfant then joined the French army, and by 1776 when the AmericanWar of Independence began, he had reached the rank of lieutenant.Like Lafayette and many other young Frenchmen of the time, L’Enfant was fired upwith the new republican ideals of liberty and equality, and promptly offered hisservices to the American Revolutionary army. His knowledge of fortificationsproved invaluable, and brought him to the attention of George Washington.L’Enfant was made ‘captain of engineers’, the embryo of what would later becomethe US Army Corps of Engineers. In March 1782 Washington was to write toL’Enfant:Your zeal and active services are such as reflect the highest honour on yourselfand are extremely pleasing to me, and I have no doubt they will have their dueweight with Congress in any future promotion in your Corps [of Engineers].101[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1659]NETWORKING WITH THE CINCINNATIWe were intrigued to discover that L’Enfant had been associated with anorganisation known as the Society of the Cincinnati.Founded in 1783 for officers who had served in the War of Independence, to helpthem and their families in case of need, the society still exists today. Namedafter the fifth century Roman soldier Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus, it is apatriotic and elitist military organisation with the peculiarity of being basedon hereditary membership and only open to the eldest male descendants of theoriginal members. George Washington was its first president and, in 1790, thesociety gave its name to the city of Cincinnati.102[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1660] Its membership would includeAmerica's first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, first secretary of war,Henry Knox, and future president, James Monroe – the latter whose name isimmortalised, of all places, in West Africa as ‘Monrovia’, the capital ofLiberia.103 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1661]Although the Society of the Cincinnati is not a Masonic order as such, many ofits founder members – Lafayette, Hamilton, Knox and Washington – wereFreemasons, and thus not surprisingly ‘the Cincinnati shared a rhetoric offraternal affection and honour as well as a significant number of members withMasonry.’104 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1662] In 1785 L’Enfantopened an architectural practice in New York, and through his Cincinnaticonnections, managed to land many lucrative design projects. When, in 1789,L’Enfant heard that plans were being made to establish a new federal capital forthe United States in Virginia, he wrote directly to his old friend GeorgeWashington. According to Jean Jules Jusserand, author, historian and formerlyFrench ambassador to the United States:105[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1663]L’Enfant, with his tendency to see things en grand, could not fail to actaccordingly, and the moment he heard that the Federal City would be neither NewYork nor Philadelphia, nor any other already in existence, but one to be builtexpressly, he wrote to Washington a letter remarkable by his clear understandingof the opportunity offered to the country, and by his determined purpose to worknot for the three million inhabitants of his day, but for the one hundred ofours, and for all the unborn millions that will come after us. The letter isdated from New York, 11th of September, 1789. ‘Sir’, he said, ‘the latedetermination of Congress to lay the foundation of a city which is to become thecapital of this vast empire offers so great an occasion of acquiring reputationto whoever may be appointed to conduct the execution of the business that yourExcellency will not be surprised that my ambition and the desire I have ofbecoming a useful citizen should lead me to wish a share in the undertaking … Nonation, perhaps, had ever before the opportunity offered them of deliberatelydeciding on the spot where their capital city should be fixed… And, although the means now within the power of the country are not such as topursue the design to any great extent, it will be obvious that the plan shouldbe drawn on such a scale as to leave room for that aggrandizement andembellishment which the increase of the wealth of the nation will permit it topursue at any period, however remote. Viewing the matter in this light, I amfully sensible of the extent of the undertaking.106[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1664] [Emphasis added]‘TEMPLAR’ OCTAGONS AGAIN, AND THE TREE OF LIFEIn early 1791 George Washington asked Thomas Jefferson to instruct L’Enfant toproceed to Georgetown to join and give assistance to Andrew Ellicott, a Quakerand Freemason from Pennsylvania who was also the land surveyor for the Districtof Columbia. Ellicott, who was 37 at the time, was the son of a watchmaker fromBucks County in Pennsylvania and had grown up with a keen interest in astronomy.He had attained the rank of major during the War of Independence, and hadsomehow worked his way into a close friendship with Washington and BenjaminFranklin – the latter being particularly interested in Ellicott's by then verygood knowledge of astronomy and of the techniques of stellar observation.107[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1665]In 1790 Washington appointed Ellicott as surveyor for the new federal capital –a job that he pursued with diligence over the coming year with the assistance ofhis younger brother Joseph. Ellicott had good reason to believe that he wasWashington's chosen man for the job. L’Enfant, however, was to change all that.The strong-willed and pompous Frenchman simply barged in armed with Washington'sinstruction to ‘assist’ and practically took over from Ellicott.L’Enfant's specific task was to ‘have a drawing of the particular grounds mostlikely to be approved for the site of the federal town and buildings.’108[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1666] L’Enfant worked closely withJefferson to produce a preliminary plan by June 1791, and in September, hereceived a letter from the newly appointed commissioners responsible for theadministration of the project informing him that the:Federal district shall be called the ‘Territory of Columbia’ and the FederalCity the ‘City of Washington’.109[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1667]L’Enfant, described by many who knew him as hot-tempered and arrogant, soonbegan to antagonise the commissioners and refused to obey their instructions.The situation deteriorated rapidly, and in February 1792 George Washington wasforced to ask Thomas Jefferson to give L’Enfant a severe warning that he mustrecognise the authority of the commissioners. L’Enfant, however, was unwillingto compromise, and resigned from the project.That same year Washington promoted Ellicott to surveyor general for the UnitedStates and gave him the task of completing the plan for Washington, DC basedlargely on L’Enfant's original design.110[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1668] Within a month Ellicott had anengraving ready.The suspicion has been raised that both George Washington and Thomas Jeffersonparticipated directly in the evolution of this plan, here and there putting intheir own specific ideas. For example, in their book The Temple and the Lodge,Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh point to curious octagonal patterns that seemto underlie the layout of Washington, DC, and argue that these were Templarsymbols introduced by Washington himself. The octagons are huge and can beclearly made out in two distinct areas centred on the Capitol and the WhiteHouse.111 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1669]The first printed edition of L’Enfant's plan, measuring 8.5 x 10 inches, is keptat the Library of Congress, Geography and Map Division, in Washington, DC.112[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1670] The engraving was made by theartists James Thackara and John Vallance, and is thought to be the earliestsurviving print of Washington, DC. Attached to the print is an article,published in the Universal Asylum and Columbian Magazine in March 1793, entitledDescription of the City of Washington, in the territory of Columbia, ceded bythe States of Virginia and Maryland to the United States, by them established asthe Seat of their Government.113[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1671]The first observation to make about L’Enfant's plan is its grand ambition. Forwhat the Frenchman had in mind was a splendid metropolis for 800,000inhabitants, with classical buildings and monuments appropriate to the capitalof an eventual gigantic republican empire of 500 million citizens. Now at thetime, the entire population of the United States could not have then been muchmore than four million. The population of the whole of Europe was, in fact, lessthan 200 million and the world's population would have been around 900 million.Today there are more than 300 million people in the United States, a figure thatis expected to double by the next century.114[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1672] If it does, the US populationwould meet up with L’Enfant's staggering projection nearly 300 years later.The plan itself is as ingenious as it is intriguing. Immediately one is struckby the similarity – or more precisely the combined similarity – to the city planof Paris, to the plan of Versailles and, even more intriguing, to Wren's andEvelyn's aborted plans for London. But this is perhaps not so surprising.Apparently Jefferson, who was himself an accomplished architect and who hadvisited and studied many European urban centres, had supplied L’Enfant withplans of several European cities to serve as a guide.115[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1673]Like Paris and London, L’Enfant's plan features a dominant east-west layout,emphasized by the alignment of the Mall (which he called Grande Avenue) thatruns from the US Capitol to the (future) Washington Monument. This wouldunderstandably lead a casual observer to conclude that the main axis of the citywas fixed, whether by intent or by coincidence, to the equinox sunrise andsunset.116 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1674] A closer examinationof the map and contemporary accounts, however, makes it clear that the principalaxis that L’Enfant had in mind was a presidential avenue (Pennsylvania Avenue),which joined the US Capitol to the presidential palace (the White House).It does not take much to see that L’Enfant's plan was heavily inspired by thelayout of Paris and, perhaps even more so, by the ‘unexecuted’ layouts of thecity of London made by Wren and Evelyn after the Great Fire.117[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1675] Most notable is thediamond-shaped design that evokes the Sephirothic Tree of Life; although not asevident as on Evelyn's plan for London, it can easily be discerned in the layoutscheme which emanates from the Capitol in the east and culminates at theWashington Monument – a gigantic obelisk – in the west.In Robert Cameron's excellent book Above Washington,118[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1676] a series of stunning aerialphotographs show that, in the main, the modern city has stayed fairly true toL’Enfant's scheme. Starting with the Capitol as the node of the plan lookingwest, two major avenues shoot at an angle, one to the southwest (Maryland) andto the other to the northwest (Pennsylvania) forming the classical upper portionof the Sephirothic Tree of Life which has as its node the first sephirah (divineemanation) representing the godhead. And although it may seem strange to equatethe Capitol with the godhead, we note that in 1830 Congress commissioned amassive statue of George Washington seated on a throne in the style of Zeus, thegodhead par excellence of the classical world. Initially placed in the forefrontof the Capitol, the statue, sculpted by Horatio Greenough, was then moved to aless ostentatious location on the east side of the Mall, and today can be seenin the Smithsonian Museum.119 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1677]Continuing with the hypothetical sephirothic scheme of L’Enfant's Washington,DC, we note that the location of the gigantic obelisk of the Washington Monumentcorresponds to the sephirah known as Tipheret, which means ‘Beauty’. Thissephirah, as we saw in Chapter Fifteen, represents the Sun, the centre ofthings, from which emanates all life and light. The analogy intended by the‘Egyptian’ obelisk that stands in Washington therefore seems obvious. Toweringmore than seven times as high those in Rome, Paris, London and New York, thispowerful solar talisman is today the emblem of the capital city of the new worldorder.ECHOESIf we overlay Christopher Wren's plan for London with L’Enfant's for Washingtonwe find that the Royal Exchange in the former corresponds with the US Capitol inthe latter. Since we know that the laying of the cornerstone of the US Capitolwas an intensely Masonic affair involving George Washington himself, thejuxtaposition of the Capitol and the Royal Exchange raises an obvious question:was any similar Masonic ceremony ever held in London for the Royal Exchange?The Royal Exchange was founded as the bourse by Sir Thomas Gresham in 1566 andreceived its present name by royal proclamation in 1571. On 3 September 1666 itwas engulfed by the Great Fire and totally destroyed. Soon afterwards, however,Charles II commissioned new plans from the architect Edward Jarman for therebuilding of the Royal Exchange120[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1678] and work began in mid-1667.Just as Washington, Freemason and president of the United States, participatedin the Capitol ceremony in 1793, so too, as we shall see, did Charles II,suspected Freemason and king of England, participate at the equivalent ceremonyat the Royal Exchange 126 years earlier.Thomas Gresham, the founder of the Royal Exchange, died in 1579. But his namehas been persistently linked to Freemasonry and his legacy continued to play arole in its development long after his death. In 1660 his London residence,Gresham's house at Bishopsgate – by then Gresham College – became the first homeof the Royal Society. The reader will recall that many of the originalprotagonists linked with Gresham College such as Sir Robert Moray, John Wilkins,Christopher Wren, Elias Ashmole and John Evelyn were, in some way or other,associated with either the Invisible College, the Royal Society or the earlyMasonic lodges in London. Though harder to specify there was also a strongMasonic ‘ambience’ at Gresham College, as Robert Lomas shows in his study of theRoyal Society. This ‘ambience’ can be sensed in Gresham's own decree that ‘sevenreaders’ or scholars should be appointed there to lecture on each of the ‘sevenliberal arts’.121 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1679] Indeed Lomasgoes so far as to argue that the college was ‘the main centre for Freemasonry inRestoration London … which Sir Thomas Gresham had set up to support his Masonicideals of study’.122 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1680]We have also seen in Chapter Fifteen how Christopher Wren, unlike John Evelyn,had retained the original location of the Royal Exchange in his plan for London,giving it a pre-eminent position in his overall layout. This is what historianAdrian Tinniswood has to say about Wren's decision:The real pride of place went to the [Royal] Exchange piazza with its radialvistas and its surrounding complex of commercial buildings. The absolutistideology underlying the planning of Sixtine Rome, which Louis XIV and André LeNôtre were currently putting to such good use in the laying out of Versailles,was here called into service to pay homage to mercantilism. Trade was to be thenew religion.123 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1681]The ‘new religion’, in Wren's mind, might well have been a concoction of the newscientific ideologies coming from Royal Society, Freemasonry and Templarism –all of which extolled the virtues of commerce and trade. For all their possibledualism at a late stage of their history let's not forget that the Templars wereat the very root of the banking and investment systems of Europe. As for theFreemasons, they would eventually insinuate themselves into the trade guilds andinto the banking, investment and insurance institutions of the city of London.Thus the Royal Exchange becomes the symbol or talisman of mercantilism and allit stands for.The confirmation that Masons and their rituals were involved in the rebuildingof Gresham's Royal Exchange after the Great Fire comes in the diary of EliasAshmole where a cryptic note reads as follows:King Charles his position of the first stone at the Royall Exchange uppon itsRestauration October 23rd, 1667, 23h. 7m. a.m. P. Esq. Ashmole et Dm. Bernard[sic].124 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1682]Elias Ashmole's pre-eminent role in the origins of Freemasonry in Englandrequires no further emphasis. It should not surprise us, therefore, thataccording to historian C. H. Josten, a specialist on Elias Ashmole who examinedthis enigmatic entry, it is perhaps telling us that King Charles II laid the‘first stone’ i.e. the cornerstone of the Royal Exchange ‘in true Masonic form,and that for this reason Ashmole, the Freemason, was asked to determine the mostpropitious time for the ceremony.’125[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1683] It is known that Ashmole wasfrequently asked by Charles II to ‘cast horoscopes’ for various statelyfunctions and, more particularly, after the Great Fire of 1666, to selectfavourable dates for the laying of the cornerstones of important buildings. Weknow he did precisely this in 1675 when, for example, he participated in thecornerstone ceremony for St. Paul's (see next section). Indeed, the tradition ofcasting horoscopes or selecting propitious astrological dates for the laying ofcornerstones of important buildings and monuments was then, and remains today, acommon practice in Freemasonry. So we may well ask what was so ‘favourable’about the date of 23 October selected by Ashmole?We've already pointed out that in 1667 England was still using the Juliancalendar which, at that time, lagged behind the Gregorian calendar by 10 – 11days. A scholar like Ashmole would have known that the Gregorian calendar mustsoon be adopted in Britain – since it was obviously based on far more precisescientific realities than the Julian. Should this happen, then 23 October Julianwould align to 13 October Gregorian. In other words, in most of continentalEurope and, more particularly, France, the date of the ceremony for ‘the firststone of the Royal Exchange’ was not 23 October but 13 October. To continentalFreemasons, this date is immediately recognisable as a ‘Templar’ date, since, aswe know, it marked the infamous suppression of the order on 13 October 1307.Ashmole was a Freemason with a keen penchant for heraldic chivalry. It is by nomeans out of the question that some sort of ‘Templar’ message was his hiddenintent.If this hypothesis is correct then similar ‘Templar’ symbolism might be expectedto turn up in other cornerstone ceremonies where Elias Ashmole was involved.This should be especially be the case for St. Paul's Cathedral which we will nowshow to be an intensely ‘Templar’ talisman.THE CORNERSTONE OF ST. PAUL'SThere ceremony for the laying of the cornerstone of the new St. Paul's issurrounded by a riddle. According to one diary entry by Elias Ashmole, the eventwas supposed to have taken place on 21 June 1675. It would also appear that itwas Ashmole who decided the date by a horoscope cast.126[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1684] There is another entry inAshmole's diary, however, that categorically states:23 June 1675 6h. 30’ a.m. The foundation of St. Paul's Church London, layd.[sic].127 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1685]Historian and astrologer Derek Appleby believes that the different dates (21June and 23 June) for the ceremony were due to a change of plan caused by badweather.128 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1686] This is possible.But there is another explanation. The prevailing calendar in England was stillthe Julian one, so that the date of 21 June – although evoking the summersolstice in the new Gregorian calendar – actually fell 10 – 11 days after thesolstice in the Julian calendar and thus had no special significance in thatrespect. What 23 June Julian did denote, however, was St. John's Eve, the heraldto the Masonic and Templar New Year celebrated on 24 June. There is no questionat all that Elias Ashmole would have been acutely aware of the meaning of thisdate. The reader will also recall that when British Freemasons created the GrandLodge they chose to do so on 24 June because it was St. John's Day. But then, in1814, the Gregorian calendar had been long previously been adopted (since 1752in fact). In Ashmole's day, however, the Julian calendar was still very much inforce.129 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1687]So what did Ashmole really have in mind – a Julian date or a Gregorian one? …If we convert 23 June Julian to its Gregorian counterpart we get 4 July.130[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1688] How likely is it to be anaccident, therefore, that in all history books on the Knights Templar, the dateof 4 July is particularly highlighted. It is the date of the Templars’ massivedefeat by Muslim armies in the Holy Land at the Horns of Hattin on 4 July 1187which was followed by the loss of Jerusalem to Christendom. There couldtherefore hardly be a more evocative ‘Templar’ or ‘Solomonic’ date than 4 July –evocative, that is, of the aspiration to rebuild Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.The reader will also be aware, of course, that 4 July is Independence Day in theUS, commemorating the signature of the Declaration of Independence andconverting the date forever into a powerful talisman that spells out‘independence’ and ‘freedom’ for the New World and, now by and large, for a newworld order.131 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1689]It would be almost perverse in these circumstances to fail to examine moreclosely the dates of the cornerstone ceremonies of powerful talismanic monumentssuch as the US Capitol and the White House – and even the Pentagon – forpossible astrological, Masonic and ‘Templar’ symbolism.THE VIRGIN AND THE STARMasonic author David Ovason points out that when the cornerstone laying ceremonyof the US Capitol took place on the morning of 18 September 1793, the Sun was inthe constellation of Virgo, which, he argues, had special significance in thescheme of things.132 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1690] Accordingto Ovason:The imagery of Virgo as ruler of Washington DC is reflected in the considerablenumber of Zodiacs and lapidary symbols which grace the city. The Virgoanconnection has also been emphasized in a number of foundation charts which areof fundamental importance to Washington DC. The foundation of the city itself,and the three corners of the triangle which L’Enfant had marked out for itscentre (the Capitol, the White House, and the Washington Monument) were each setdown on the earth at a time when the constellation Virgo had a particularimportance in the skies.133 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1691]Not being astrologers or Freemasons ourselves, we cannot vouch for certain onOvason's theory. What we can support, however, is the hunch that astronomy hadan important part to play in the planning and symbolism of cities such asWashington, DC.134 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1692] Ovason goeson to make a particularly strong case that much of the symbolism surroundingevents and monuments related to the Declaration of Independence and thefoundation of the United States can be linked to the ancient heraldic starSirius, whose pictogram was the well-known five-pointed star.135[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1693] With this in mind, there is, wethink, another astronomical matter to consider in connection to the Capitol.Astronomical software such as Starry Night or SkyMap Pro, makes it a relativelyeasy matter to reconstruct ancient skies for any epoch and any location with ahigh level of precision and realism. We can thus, quite literally, observeevents that were going on ‘invisibly’ in the sky (invisible because they wereobscured to the naked eye by the light of the Sun) when the cornerstone of theCapitol was laid on the morning of 18 September 1793.At Jenkins Heights, the location of the future Capitol, preparations had beengoing on through the night for the arrival of George Washington and his retinueof important guests. The White House (which had undergone its own Masoniccornerstone ceremony a little less than a year earlier on the now familiar‘Templar’ date of 13 October 1792)136[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1694] was to be the starting point ofthe procession. From there the presidential party would travel in horse-drawncarriages along Pennsylvania Avenue to Jenkins Heights.The alignment of Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and Jenkins Heightsis 22° south-of-east. Looking along this alignment it cannot be an accident thata few hours before sunrise on 18 September 1793 (cloud conditions allowing)observers would have been able to see the bright star Sirius rising directlyover Jenkins Heights. It would slowly have gained in altitude as the worldturned, so that by dawn it would have been positioned, quite alone, over thespot where the Capitol would stand. That such portentous astral symbolism couldhave gone unnoticed by the group of important Freemasons and astronomers whoplanned Washington and decided the locations of its principal structures, seemsmost unlikely. But if this is so, it would mean that the axis of PennsylvaniaAvenue must have been deliberately set by Pierre L’Enfant and/or by hiscolleague Andrew Ellicott so that it would be directed towards the rising of thestar Sirius.Is there anything to suggest that this is likely?We have already seen how Pierre L’Enfant, while a student of architecture andcity planning in Paris, had been much influenced by the work of the 17th centurylandscaper André Le Nôtre. It was Le Nôtre who had been directly responsible forthe famous axis of Paris running from the Tuileries Garden, on the west side ofthe Louvre, along the Champs-Élysées and all the way to Chaillot Hill – wheretoday stands the Arc de Triomphe. This axis, as the reader will recall, wasdirected by Le Nôtre 26° north-of-west and 26° south-of-east such that italigned, whether by coincidence or intent, to the rising-point of Sirius – also26° south-of-east – as observed from Paris during the reign of Louis XIV.Because there is a difference of 10° of latitude between Paris and Washington,DC, the rising point of Sirius as observed from Washington is also different. Wehave seen calculations show that the star rose 22° south-of-east, and thus inline with Pennsylvania Avenue,137[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1695] when observed from Washingtonin the epoch of L’Enfant.It makes sense to suppose that L’Enfant would have been wellaware of this fact.And so would the respected surveyor and astronomer, Andrew Ellicott, the manresponsible for physically setting out the axis of Pennsylvania Avenue. Being aFreemason as well, he could hardly have ignored the alignment with the rising ofSirius, the five-pointed ‘Blazing Star’ of the Scottish Rite Masons, which wouldhave been very obvious for much of the year to anyone standing at the WhiteHouse and looking southeast towards the site of the future Capitol …138[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1696]So let us venture a little further in this direction and see what else comes up.HIDDEN IN THE SKYWhile researching his book, The Secret Zodiacs of Washington DC, David Ovasonnoticed that when he looked back from the US Capitol westwards alongPennsylvania Avenue towards the White House from 6 to 12 August he would see theSun setting in alignment with this avenue:For a period of about one week, the sunset viewed from the Capitol seems to takeplace directly over the western end of Pennsylvania Avenue. From 6 to 12 Augustthe disc of the sun cuts into the horizon above the avenue, with almost magicalprecision. Anyone who watches the sunset, on any of those days, cannot fail torealise that the designers of this city intended this period – or perhaps oneday in this period – to be an important element in the city's design.139[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1697]Ovason goes on to note that:In terms of the spherical geometry of astronomy, and the computerised programsavailable in modern times, there is no problem to establish a ‘theoretical’ datefor the significant sunset. The Capitol is at longitude W 77° 01’, latitude N38° 53’. The azimuth for Pennsylvania Avenue proposed by Ellicott and L’Enfantwas 290 degrees. This points to sunset around 11 and 12 August.140[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1698]If we use similar computer software to recreate the sky for the epoch of 1793 asseen from Washington, DC, and focus our attention on the period of 11 – 12August, we will notice something most interesting not only regarding the Sun, asOvason has observed, but also regarding the star Sirius. For on these very daysSirius rose heliacally, i.e. shortly before the Sun. The reader will recall thatthe heliacal rising of Sirius in ancient Egypt was the astrosolar event markingthe beginning or ‘birth’ of the New Year and seems to have been the focus ofmuch attention in Masonic esoteric lore. Let us recall also that the heliacalrising of Sirius was incorporated into the myth of the ‘solar’ birth ofAlexander the Great and, if our theory is correct, into the myth of Louis XIV’s‘Capetian miracle’, and also into the very axis of Paris itself.If you were both a land surveyor as well as a Freemason, like Andrew Ellicott(or, indeed, like George Washington himself), it would have been difficult underthese circumstances not to associate the event of the heliacal rising of Siriusas viewed from Washington in 1793 with the ‘birth’ of the new Federal City andcapital of the world's first true republic since Rome. It is perhaps pertinentalso to note that the world's first ‘republic’ had been founded by Julius Caesarwho, as it turns out, commemorated the republican era with the founding of theJulian calendar in 48 BC which had been calibrated for him in Alexandria inEgypt by an Egyptian astronomer who made use of the heliacal rising of Sirius.Can it be a coincidence, therefore, that on 15 April 1791 at 3:30 p.m., acongregation of Freemasons gathered in Alexandria near the future site ofWashington, DC and enacted the Masonic ceremony of the ‘first stone’ presidedover by the Master of Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22?141[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1699] Let us also note in passingthat the Sun was in Pisces, a Christic symbol, when the constellation of Leo (a‘kingly’ symbol) was on the rise in the east.Next let's consider the heliacal rising of Sirius as seen from the city of Parisin that same year of 1793. There, because of the change of latitude, it wouldhave occurred not on 11 – 12 August but on 20 August. In plain observationalterms, this means that when looking from the Place de l’Étoile towards theLouvre just before dawn on 20 August 1793, an observer would have see the starSirius rising over the Louvre Palace's south wing, right above the apartmentswhere the ‘Capetian miracle’ had taken place. Also at this precise moment theSun would have been in conjunction with the star Regulus, Alpha Leonis, the starof the ‘solar-kings’. Indeed, this is why in ancient times the official‘birthday’ of Alexander the Great was celebrated on 26 July Julian – because onthat day the same conjunction of the Sun and Regulus likewise accompanied theheliacal rising of Sirius in Alexandria.Such occult and astrological considerations seem in place in Alexandria in 332BC, but we found it quite eerie and unsettling to be obliged to suspect thatthey also determined the positioning and alignments of major avenues andmonuments in the great modern cities of the West.And still the clues kept on presenting themselves …AN OBELISK FOR WASHINGTONIn 1799, five years after the founding of Washington, DC, George Washingtondied. The Freemasons of the United States organised his stately funeral, and allthe lodges both in America and in France were temporarily turned into ‘lodges ofsorrow’.In that same year of 1799 Napoleon's army occupied Egypt. To all RepublicanMasons, this must have seemed like a great historical moment when the ancient‘home’ of Freemasonry was finally drawn into the new Masonic-cum-republicanworld order initiated by the United States and France.Soon after Washington's death, plans were prepared to raise a great ‘nationalmonument’ in Washington, DC due west of the US Capitol in commemoration of thefirst president of the Republic. In May 1800, the congressional committee formedfor this purpose expressed itself in favour of building a pyramid, 100 feetsquare at the base and ‘of proportional height’, but lack of funds and,eventually lack of interest, meant that the project was shelved.142[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1700] In 1833, however, a group ofpatriots created the Washington National Monument Society, which was successfulin raising funds. Approval was obtained from Congress for the design andconstruction of an edifice appropriate to the memory of the ‘Father of theNation’.The first design proposed was by Peter Force, an influential Freemason and oneof the founding members of the society. His idea, too, was a pyramid, but thistime even more enormous than the one envisaged in 1800.143[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1701] In 1836 a design was putforward by Robert Mills, a Freemason and architect, which consisted of acircular colonnaded temple with a statue of Washington in Graeco-Roman garbriding the solar chariot of Apollo with a huge obelisk rising above it adornedwith an enormous ‘blazing five-pointed star’ at the top. The design that wasfinally retained, however, was that of a lone giant obelisk with a taperedpyramidal apex – the Washington Monument that we know today. The obelisk, whichis slightly taller than 555 feet, had to be placed slightly offset from thecenterline of the Mall due to poor groundbearing conditions in the ideal spot.The notion of a pyramid (and an obelisk is simply a pyramid on a pillar) risingsymbolically above the new Republic has a background. It had previously beenproposed in 1776 when Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson designed the GreatSeal of the United States (which can still be still seen today on the back ofthe US one-dollar bill, introduced in 1931 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, a 32nddegree Scottish Rite Freemason). In 1789 the same symbol was placed on top ofthe Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen signed in Paris underthe guidance of the Freemasons Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Lafayette.The cornerstone ceremony for the Washington Monument took place on IndependenceDay, 4 July 1848. We have already discussed the curious ‘Templar’ symbolism ofthis date, and also how it ‘converts’ to the St. John's Day of the Freemasonsaccording to the Julian calendar. Appropriately, therefore, the cornerstoneritual for the Washington Monument was organised by the Freemasons of America,hundreds of whom attended in full Masonic regalia.144[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1702] The ceremony was conducted by aprominent Mason, Benjamin French, the Grand Master for the District of Columbia,who donned the Masonic apron and sash that George Washington had worn for the1793 ceremony of the Capitol. According to author David Ovason,The moment of the ceremonial cornerstone laying of the Monument has beenpreserved, and from this it is possible to reconstruct the foundation chart … Inmany ways it is a remarkable horoscope, for it reflects precisely the same sortof stellar magic as was practiced in ancient Egypt, millennia ago.145[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1703]Due to lack of funds and political shenanigans, construction was delayed forseveral decades after the cornerstone had been laid, and it was not until 1880that work began again at the site. A ‘second’ cornerstone ceremony was thereforearranged for 7 August 1880 at ‘one minute of 11 o'clock.’ Sensing that thiscuriously precise timing (10:59 a.m.) was for astronomical rather thanastrological reasons, David Ovason worked out that the intention might have beento make a link with the rising of a particular star which, in this case, turnedout to be Spica, the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo. Theinspiration may have perhaps come from the Masonic astronomer Lalande who hadbeen a founding member of the Nine Sisters lodge in Paris and who was present,along with Benjamin Franklin and the Tarot astrologer Court de Gébelin, at theinitiation of Voltaire in 1778. Lalande had written that:The Virgin is consecrated to Isis, just as Leo is consecrated to her husbandOsiris … They put a wheat-ear in the hand of the Virgin, to express the idea ofthe months, perhaps because the sign of the Virgin was called by theOrientalists … epi, or wheat-ear.146[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1704]It is likely that such ideas were entertained by those involved in thecornerstone ceremony of the Washington Obelisk which, after all, is a blatant‘Egyptian’ symbol selected by Freemasons.The final dedication of the obelisk took place on 21 February 1885, which was,curiously enough, just one day after George Washington's birthday. On that coldand snowy day, 21 Masonic lodges of the District of Columbia, as well as Masonicdelegations from Massachusetts, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,Texas, South Carolina and Georgia, along with a vast number of ‘brothers’,formed a huge procession. The president and members of Congress joined theFreemasons while a huge crowd of onlookers cheered and the US Marine Band playeda ‘number of rousing marches.’ Ovason's calculations show that this ceremony,which took place in the afternoon, occurred at the moment of the rising ofSirius over the Capitol.147 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1705]‘The extraordinary truth’, he concludes:… is that the very existence of the Washington Monument is intimately linked tothe Egyptian star Sirius … that the ancients represented in their sacredhieroglyphics as an obelisk-like form as well as a star. How is it possible thatthis most important star of the ancient world should find itself, as it were,resurrected in the architecture of the United States?148[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1706]In 1998 Robert Bauval visited the Washington Monument, which had been completelyshored up with scaffolding for repair and embellishments in preparation for themillennium celebration planned for Washington, DC. Inside the monument'sentrance, right over the door lintel, Bauval noticed a bronze plaque on whichthe face of George Washington had been sculpted by the French artistJean-Antoine Houdon, a Freemason, and member of the Nine Sisters lodge in Paris,whose other subjects had included Cagliostro and Empress Joséphine.149[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1707] Above the plaque was theunmistakable motif of the ancient Egyptian winged solar disc with a starprominently positioned at its centre.We can now safely guess which star is represented here …THE PENTAGON AND SIRIUSIn 1941, fifty-six years after the final dedication ceremony of the WashingtonMonument, another cornerstone was laid in Washington, DC, this time for agigantic five-sided, star-shaped edifice: the Pentagon. The notables attendingwere not in Masonic regalia but instead wore the uniforms, spangled with goldfive-pointed stars of the highest-ranking US military personnel.Before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the 24,000 civilian and militarypersonnel of the US War Department in Washington, DC were scattered amongst 17buildings throughout the District of Columbia. In view of the forthcoming entryof the United States into World War II, it was hastily decided to place allthese personnel together into one gigantic, centralised headquarters.150[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1708] The job was given to theconstruction division of the US Army Quartermaster Corps, which produced adesign for the future Pentagon in July 1941. The plans were approved byPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt who, on 1 December 1941, signed legislationtransferring the whole project to the US Army Corps of Engineers. The firstsection was completed in April 1942, and the full edifice was completed on 15January 1943 at a total cost of $85 million.151[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1709]In view of the great importance of the project, all the major decisions wereapproved by President Roosevelt himself.152[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1710] It is often claimed that thedistinctive and eponymous pentagonal shape of the building was derived from thefact that the first location proposed near Arlington cemetery was a five-sidedplot of land. But if so, the question arises why the pentagonal design wasretained even though another site was eventually chosen further to the south.It is, of course, entirely possible that the prosaic explanation is the truth.But it is also true that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was raised as a MasterFreemason in 1911 at the Holland Lodge No. 8 in New York and, in 1929 became a32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason at the Albany Masonic Temple.153[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1711] He would have been acutelyaware, as were all high ranking Scottish Rite Masons who had read Albert Pike'sMorals & Dogma, that the pentagonal shape, or pentacle, was associated by Pikewith the Masonic Blazing Star and, in turn, identified with the five-pointedstar of ancient Egypt, Sirius.In Robert Cameron's book Above Washington,154[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1712] there is a remarkablephotograph taken by NASA with infrared film, which ‘demonstrates the ultimaterefinement in aerial photography’. The photograph was taken by a U-2 spy planefrom an altitude of 65,000 feet. Although the ‘technical reading’ for images ofthis sort is very specialised, even lay viewers can easily see that thepositioning of the Pentagon on the west side of the Potomac seems to be guidedby the general axis that leads southeast – and more or less parallel to MarylandAvenue across the river – straight towards the US Capitol.Turning the observation around Robert Bauval calculated that the Pentagon liessome 24° south-of-west when viewed from the Capitol. Reconstructing the skiesover Washington, DC for the epoch 1941 with Starry Night, and directing hisattention to 24° south-of-west he typed the command to ‘run’ the sky. As he hadhalf-expected the star Sirius positioned itself right over the spot where theNASA photograph shows that the Pentagon is situated. Naturally Bauval wonderedif here, too, a cornerstone ceremony had taken place in 1941 …THE TRUE ‘NEW JERUSALEM’ IN ISRAEL?Every American, indeed almost everyone in the world, is acutely aware of thedate of 11 September 2001. This was the ‘day of infamy’ when Arab terroristscrashed a commercial plane into the US Pentagon and two other planes into theTwin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York.It was therefore very strange, indeed almost surreal, to discover that the dateof the ground-breaking ceremony for the Pentagon was also 11 September – in itscase 11 September 1941. Little has been made of this, although the coincidencecan hardly be said to be obscure since President George W. Bush himself drewattention to it in a speech he gave to Pentagon staff exactly a month after theattack. According to the Army Link News:President George W. Bush, Lt. Gen. John Van Alstyne and First Lady Laura Bushjoined a joint-service chorus and thousands of flag-waving Pentagon personnel insinging ‘God Bless America’ during the memorial ceremony at the Pentagon Oct.11, 2001 … He [the president] listed a number of victims: three school childrentravelling with their teacher on the hijacked jet, an Army general officer, aDepartment of the Army civilian who had worked 30 years in the Pentagon, and anaval reservist. The President recalled how construction on the Pentagon, ‘asymbol of America's freedom and confidence’ and ‘a symbol of our strength in theworld,’ began 60 years ago on Sept. 11, 1941 … [Emphasis added]At this point we ask the reader to recall two things: (1) the intense ‘Templar’and ‘Judaic’ characteristics of the Scottish Rite ceremonies to ‘rebuildSolomon's Temple’ in the context of the lodges; and (2) the root of the Islamicterrorists’ grievance against the US – which is the oppression of thePalestinian people and the political and military support that the superpowerextends to the state of Israel.Could there have been more to President Roosevelt's – and President Truman's –involvement in the affair of the US Pentagon and the date of 11 September thanat first meets the eye?Is it a coincidence, for example, that the principal symbol used in 32nd degreeScottish Masonry is, in fact, a pentagon? And is it also a coincidence that inthe same Masonic order, and same 32nd degree, the symbol of the pentagon isdivided into five ‘military’ divisions of the ‘Scottish Rite Army’ in the sameway the US Pentagon is divided into the five branches of the US Military?155[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1713] More to the point, the Masonicauthor Christopher Knight, when investigating this very matter of the strangesimilarity between the US Pentagon and 32nd degree Scottish Rite rituals andsymbolism, wrote,… We could hardly believe our eyes. The 32nd degree is known as the degree of‘The Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret’. It comprises of three separate parts.These are the Opening Ceremony, the Ceremonial Section and the Allegory. Thisparticular ceremony is very elaborate, as befits someone who has climbed as highon the Freemasonic ladder as it is possible to go under one's own effort. Agreat deal of play-acting takes place and the various characters all havefictional names. It suggests that the 32nd degree relates to the fight forJerusalem … The ceremony takes place in what appears to be a fictitious militarycamp … [which] is a five sided figure or pentagon …156[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1714]We know, of course, of the many harebrained conspiracy theories that followedthe 11 September 2001 attacks, and we don't want to add more fuel to the fire.But it is also obvious that the foreign policies of Presidents Roosevelt andTruman greatly contributed to the creation of the state of Israel in the secondhalf of the 1940s, and this made us wonder about their common affiliation to theScottish Rite.There is also the bizarre fact that President Roosevelt was both a 32nd degreeScottish Rite Mason as well as the 32nd president of the United States, whilePresident Truman – who had been Roosevelt's vice-president – was both a 33rddegree Scottish Rite Mason and the 33rd president of the United States. InScottish Rite Freemasonry, the four final degrees, from the 30th to the 33rd arethe stage of initiation at which the candidate is thought to achieve the sublimeobjective of the Masonic enlightenment (or, some would say, ‘experiment’), which– allegorically – is the ‘rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem’.We've seen that the ‘tracing board’ provided in the rituals of the ScottishRite's 30th degree makes use of the Sephirothic Tree of Life – which can betaken as the ‘spiritual’ representation of Solomon's Temple. As noted above, allsuch rituals are supposed to be purely allegorical, and we are assured by Masonsthat their meaning is simply that the candidate has achieved a level ofspiritual perfection within himself as the human ‘temple’, and is thus compared,in a sense, to the perfection of the ‘Temple of Solomon’.Nonetheless we can hardly avoid posing the obvious question: is it possible thatthe Roosevelt and Truman administrations took the ‘Masonic experiment’ all theway and actually ‘rebuilt’ the Jewish Solomonic state in Palestine? Asfarfetched and incredible as it seems, there is something else in the backgroundthat justifies such an outrageous question – and this is the actual ‘degrees’that both these presidents were linked to.FROM THE 30TH TO THE 33RD DEGREESeveral years ago while visiting a friend in Egypt, Robert Bauval was shown aScottish Rite Masonic certificate issued at a lodge in Cairo in 1918 by theSupreme Council of the 33rd Degree. The certificate had belonged to the friend'smaternal grandfather. Freemasonry is practically unknown in Egypt today, havingbeen declared illegal by President Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1964. But in the earlypart of the 20th century it was extremely popular and many high-rankinggovernment officials and even members of the Egyptian royal family wereFreemasons.157 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1715]The certificate was printed in French and Arabic. Bauval, who is fluent in bothlanguages, could not help noting not only that the location of the SupremeCouncil was specified as ‘Cairo’, but also that the precise latitude was givenas ‘under the celestial vault at the zenith by 30° 2’ 4” …’ which would pinpointthe location to somewhere in central Cairo near Abdeen Palace.Here is a curious fact. The modern state of Israel extends from latitude 30°north to 33° north. When carried west into Egypt, the former latitude passesalmost through the Great Pyramid of Giza.We are reminded of the historical statement sent by President Truman to theprovisional government of Israel on 14 May 1948. It reads simply:This Government has been informed that a Jewish state has been proclaimed inPalestine, and recognition has been requested by the provisional governmentthereof. The United States recognizes the provisional government as the de factoauthority of the State of Israel.158[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1716]Two decades later, in June 1967, Israeli forces stormed Jerusalem and recapturedthe city from the Arabs after eight centuries of Muslim occupation. The Star ofDavid had finally risen again. The ‘cornerstone’ of the New Jerusalem and, byextension the New Temple, had been laid.As has several times been the case during our years of research for this book,we felt the ghostly lifting of a veil brush against our faces. Yet this time therevelation of what lay behind the veil was so sinister, so worrying and somisunderstood by so many, that at first we thought it best to let it be, toignore it, to delete it from our thoughts lest we be branded as ‘conspiracytheorists’.Only after much consideration have we reached the conclusion that we must bringthis strange and frightening issue to attention."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUETHE MASTER GAMEMay 14th [1948], David Ben Gurion is creating history.

Bin Laden called upon all Muslims to wage a ‘Holy War’ against Jewsand ‘Crusaders’, i.e. Americans and their allies, ‘until the Aqsa Mosque (inJerusalem) and the Haram Mosque (in Makkah) are freed from their grip.’Three years later, on 11 September 2001, Bin Laden's organisation, the dreadedAl Qaeda, masterminded the destruction of the Twin Towers of the World TradeCenter in New York and severe damage to the Pentagon in Washington, DC by havingsuicide volunteers hijack four commercial airlines and fly three of them intothose buildings. This abominable event has gone down in history as 9/11.On 20 November 2003 the British consulate and the HSBC bank in Istanbul, Turkey,were destroyed by suicide bombers. A man claiming to be from the Turkish GreatOrient Raiders of the Eastern Front (TGOREF) telephoned the semi-officialAnatolian News Agency and coldly informed them that the TGOREF and Bin Laden'sAl Qaeda group had jointly carried out the attacks. The mysterious voice thenadded these sinister words:Our attacks against Masonic targets will continue. Muslims are not alone.2[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1718]And on 22 January 2003 the controversial north London Muslim spiritual leader,Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, expressed these strange views to the Independent:I am not saying every American government figure knew about this [September11th].

In 1978 the most influential body inpromulgating and interpreting Islamic law and ideologies, the IslamicJurisdictional College (IJC) located at Al-Azhar University, condemnedFreemasonry as an evil organization. Seventeen years later the same condemnationof Freemasonry was repeated in Saudi Arabia in the Saudi Gazette of 13 January1995, ‘The Curse of Freemasonry: In Questions of Faith’, which reprinted thetext issued in 1978 by the IJC at its meeting in Makkah. We show here only items7, 8 and 10 which are self-evident:7. It [Freemasonry] is a Jewish Organization in its roots. Its secret higherinternational administrative board are Jews and it promotes Zionist activities. 8. Its primary objectives are the distraction of all religions and it distractsMuslims from Islam. 10. It has branches under different names as a camouflage so people cannot traceits activities, especially if the name of Freemasonry has opposition. Thesehidden branches are known are Lions, Rotary and others. They have wickedprinciples that completely contradict the rules of Islam. There is a clearrelationship between Freemasonry, Judaism, and International Zionism. It hascontrolled the activities of high Arab Officials in the Palestinian Problem. Ithas limited their duties, obligations and activities for the benefit of theJudaism and International Zionism. Given that Freemasonry involves itself indangerous activities, it is a great hazard, with wicked objectives, theJurisdictional Synod determines that Freemasonry is a dangerous, destructiveorganization. Any Muslim who affiliates with it, knowing the truth of itsobjectives, is an infidel to Islam.6[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1722]Such condemnations are now commonplace on the Internet. For example, in apopular website, ‘Islam online’, we also found the following statement regardingFreemasonry and Islam:The Society of Freemasons aims to rebuild the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalemafter destroying Al-Aqsa Mosque because the Jews allege that the mosque has beenbuilt on the site of the destroyed temple. Everything that furthers the interestof the Jews and promotes their position in the world is undertaken by thesociety. The cover of absolute secrecy and its strict hierarchy enables it tomake use of the positions and influence of its non-Jewish members to serve theJewish cause. We have to understand that many of its members work for thesociety trusting that they only serve the causes of liberty, equality andjustice. They remain unaware that they simply serve the cause of giving the Jewssupremacy in world affairs. Islam respects other religions. Freemasonry deceivesits members into thinking that they further the cause of a better humanity whenthey are actually furthering the interests of those who seek to give the Jewssupremacy over all peoples of the world. Islam is the final message from Allahto man. It is the religion that supersedes all past divine messages, includingJudaism. Freemasonry seeks to destroy Al-Aqsa Mosque in order to rebuild theTemple of Solomon in its place.7[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1723]In an article entitled ‘The New Islamic Fascism’ published in November 2001 inthe Jerusalem Post, Robert S. Wistrich, professor of modern European and Jewishhistory at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, wrote:This Middle Eastern radicalism is a distinctly modern movement, though it alsohas indigenous Islamic roots. The conspiracy theory at its heart, which linksplutocratic capitalism, international freemasonry, Zionism, and MarxistCommunism, is almost identical with the mythical structure of Nazianti-Semitism. For contemporary jihadists, a ‘Judaized’ America and Israel,together with heretical, secular Muslim regimes are the godless spearhead ofthese dark occult forces that seek to destroy Islam and undermine the culturalidentity of Muslim believers.8 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1724]The perception that some Islamic militants have about the imaginary collusionbetween Freemasonry and Zionism needs to be carefully understood, not leastbecause Islam is insinuating itself more and more deeply into the Western worldwhere Freemasonry is widely practiced, especially in Britain and the US. We havenoted how Islamic terrorists broke into a Masonic lodge in Turkey in March 2004spraying bullets and detonating several bombs. Fortunately the only person todie in the attack was one of the terrorists. The second terrorist, Engin Vural,who survived was eventually tried in a Turkish court in August 2004. Vuralconfessed that he, as well as many other militants received their training inPakistan and Afghanistan, and their network had planned more such attacks. On 13March 2004, Al-Jazeera published an English translation of a statement purportedto be from Al Qaeda:Jund al-Quds [Soldiers of Jerusalem] targeted a Jewish Masonic lodge inIstanbul. Three top Masons were killed in the operation, and if it was not fortechnical failure all the Masons would have been killed. Thanks to God anyway.9[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1725]More recently, CNN reported an aborted attack by a Muslim student on a Masonictemple in Atlanta, Georgia.10 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1726]THE LIE THAT WOULD NOT DIEUnfortunately in the Muslim world the term Massoony (‘Freemason’) in the Arabiclanguage is often used synonymously with ‘Zionist’ and vilified as one and thesame thing. Indeed the term Massoony is also often used as a generic name for amultitude of organizations supposedly secretly colluding or working for theZionists, the Israelis, the CIA and so forth, and believed to manipulate banks,military institutions, the media, educational bodies, governments and even theUnited Nations! To be more specific, many Arabs believe that the Muslim Worldand more specifically the Middle East is threatened by a secretive satanic forcemasterminded and manipulated by Freemasons and Zionists with the US branded asthe ‘Big Satan’ and Israel the ‘Small Satan’.But where and why did such ideas originate?The Masonic-Zionist conspiracy theory has its roots in the so-called Protocolsof the Elders of Zion. This slim document, first published in Russia in 1903 –5, purports to unmask a Zionist-cum-Masonic plot to take control of the world,and was used in anti-Semitic propaganda in Russia and later in Nazi Germany inthe 1930s and, more recently, among radical Muslims.11[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1727] Although long shown to be ahoax,12 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1728] the Protocols havenonetheless been widely circulated and believed throughout the Middle East andare now used as a major propaganda tool in the spread of Islamism in the Westernworld. In 2002 Steven Simon,13 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1729]assistant director of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, told theBritish House of Commons:The texts [the Protocols] that are very influential among al-Qaeda types andrecruits to the organization, texts that can be found on the Internet or inbroadsheets or in bookstores in the Middle East, already postulate a worldwideinfidel conspiracy against Islam. The United States may bear the brunt ofresponsibility, but it is seen as part of a larger challenge, consisting of,depending on what you read, the UN, the EU, NATO and the Freemasons for thatmatter. As odd as that sounds, they have a prominent role in much of thisconspiracy thinking.14 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1730]Although the supposed Masonic-Zionist conspiracy is generally seen in theIslamic world as a secular evil, Freemasons are often associated with themysterious and satanic figure of the Masih ad-Dajjal (roughly translated as the‘false prophet’ or ‘false messenger’) who, in Muslim lore, is supposed to appearbefore the Yawm al-Qiyamah or ‘Day of Judgment’. According to hadith the Dajjalhas one eye which, as to be expected, is often linked to the single eye in thepyramid on the US one-dollar bill and, of course, the ‘eye in the triangle’symbol used extensively in Freemasonry. The Internet is rife with websites thatconnect Freemasonry with the Dajjal. According to many of these websites,Freemasonry was behind the Gulf War, the invasion of Afghanistan, the Iraq War,the oppression in the Gaza strip and the turmoil in Pakistan.Experts on anti-terrorism are gradually coming round to realise that there is agrowing and dangerous paranoia about Freemasonry in some Islamic quarters thatis extremely worrying, not least because it is drummed into the young minds,often even as part of school curricula. For example, in Saudi Arabia a lessonfor tenth grade boys on the Zionist Movement included in a schoolbook on Islamicculture is ‘a curious blend of wild conspiracy theories about Masonic lodges,Rotary Clubs, and Lions Clubs with anti-Semitic invective. It asserts that theProtocols of the Elders of Zion is an authentic document and teaches studentsthat it reveals what Jews really believe.’15[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1731]THE SEMBLANCE OF A ‘MASONIC-ZIONIST CONSPIRACY’Many US presidents were Freemasons, including George Washington. But morerelevant here are those two presidents who are known to have been involved inthe creation of the modern state of Israel16[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1732] – Franklin D. Roosevelt and,more directly, Harry S. Truman. As we saw in the last chapter, Roosevelt was the32nd president of the United States as well as a 32nd degree Scottish RiteMason. Harry Truman was the 33rd president of the United States and a 33rddegree Scottish Rite Mason. It may not be too far-fetched to speculate that the32nd degree could bear a relevance to Solomon's Temple. As has often beensuggested there is, at the very least, a curious similarity with the CabbalisticSephirothic Tree of Life formed by the 22 paths plus the 10 ‘emanations’ ofJehovah. Moreover, some Scottish Rite certificates show the location of theissuing lodge by giving the geographical latitude in degrees – and this has beentaken to suggest a mystical connection between degrees of latitude and theMasonic ‘degrees’ of initiation. It is perhaps more than a coincidence that thegeographical latitude of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem lies just south of the32nd parallel while the ‘Mother Lodge’ of the Scottish Rite was originallylocated in the city of Charleston in South Carolina just off the 33rd parallel.The York Rite Freemasons of America run a periodical called Knight Templar, withthe seal of the so-called Grand Encampment of Knights Templar of the USA.17[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1733] The front cover of the August2010 issue of Knight Templar shows the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, with theWailing Wall and the Dome of the Rock and an Israeli flag dominating thescene.18 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1734]Radical Arabs perceive a conspiracy in all this involving, at the very least,American Freemasons and the World Zionist Organization.19[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1735] And the recent discovery of thediaries of former Secretary of the Treasury Hans Morgentau has added fuel tothis political fire. The diaries report a meeting between Morgentau andRoosevelt on 3 December 1942 at which President Roosevelt made theseextraordinary comments regarding the eventual creation of a Jewish state inPalestine:I actually would put a barbed wire around Palestine, and I would begin to movethe Arabs out of Palestine … Each time we move out an Arab we would bring inanother Jewish family … 90% of them should be Jews … It would be an independentnation just like any other nation – completely independent. Naturally, if thereare 90% Jews, the Jews would dominate the government.20[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1736]THE LETTER THAT STUNNED THE WORLDDuring the early hours of 14 May 1948, according to the BBC2 programme cited atthe beginning of this chapter, the Zionist leader David Ben Gurion put thefinishing touches to the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israelwhich he would soon read. Let us note in passing that the population ofPalestine at that time was just over two million souls of whom thirty per centwere Jews, while the remaining majority were mostly Muslims and a small numberof Christians. Civil war between Muslims and Jews had broken out, and at firstit looked like the Jews would be overwhelmed by an Arab military alliance formedby Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon.At 4 p.m. Ben Gurion read the Declaration which started with the words:The land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here theirspiritual, religious and national identity was formed. Here they achievedindependence and created a culture of national and universal significance. Herethey wrote and gave the Bible to the world.21[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1737]The Declaration goes on to state that,Accordingly, we, the members of the National Council, representing the Jewishpeople in Palestine and the Zionist movement of the world, met together insolemn assembly today, the day of the termination of the British Mandate forPalestine, by virtue of the natural and historic right of the Jewish people andof the Resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We herebyproclaim the establishment of the Jewish State in Palestine, to be called ISRAEL… The State of Israel will be open to the immigration of Jews from all countriesof their dispersion; will promote the development of the country for the benefitof all its inhabitants; will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice andpeace taught by the Hebrew Prophets … our call goes out the Jewish people allover the world to rally to our side in the task of immigration and developmentand to stand by us in the great struggle for the fulfilment of the dream ofgenerations – the redemption of Israel. With trust in Almighty God, we set ourhand to this Declaration, at this Session of the Provisional State Council, inthe city of Tel Aviv, on this Sabbath eve, the fifth of Iyar, 5708, thefourteenth day of May, 1948.22 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1738]The Declaration announced that the Jewish state would officially come intoexistence at midnight on 14 May 1948 which marked the end of the British Mandatefor Palestine. In Washington this would be 6 p.m. EST on 14 May.At about the same time that Ben Gurion was in the process of reading theDeclaration in Tel Aviv, Eliahu Epstein, head of the Jewish Agency for Israel,now calling himself, ‘agent to the provisional government of Israel’, received aphone call from Clark Clifford,23[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1739] the special counsel toPresident Truman. Clifford, who was in his early forties at this time, urgedEpstein to write at once to President Truman to ‘welcome Israel into thecommunity of nations’. Then at 11 minutes after the proclamation of a Jewishstate in Palestine became effective, President Truman recognized the provisionalgovernment as the ‘de facto authority of the State of Israel’.24[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1740]It seems inconceivable, at least in our opinion, that President Truman gave hispersonal approval within minutes, presumably without having seen the details ofthe constitution of this new ‘Jewish state’ claiming biblical rights to modernPalestine! At any rate, David Ben Gurion was immediately made Israel's firstprime minister and Chaim Weizmann, the ‘guiding spirit behind the ZionistOrganization [now called the World Zionist Organization]’ who was at the timeliving in New York, was to become it's first ‘president’.But what really happened at the White House on that fateful and confusing day of14 May 1948?AN INSIDER'S ACCOUNTIn his memoirs, Clark Clifford revealed some rather shocking aspects of how andwhy President Truman so hastily recognized the Jewish state of Israel.25[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1741]A little background information is necessary at this stage. All who understoodthis vexed issue knew that the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine of 29November 1947 was,… patently unfair, it awarded 56 percent of Palestine to its 650,000 Jewishinhabitants, and 44 percent to its 1,300,000 Muslim and Christian Arabinhabitants. Partition was adopted only after ruthless arm-twisting by the USgovernment and by 26 pro-Zionist US senators who [sent] in telegrams to a numberof UN member states.26 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1742]Making matters worse was Truman's famous statement regarding the Zionist lobbyin America, in which he bluntly gave this explanation of his position:I’m sorry, gentlemen, but I have to answer to hundreds of thousands who areanxious for the success of Zionism: I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabsamong my constituents.27 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1743]As predicted by many, no sooner was the UN Partition Plan adopted thanwidespread armed fighting broke out between Jews and Arabs, as the latterrejected wholesale the partition arrived at by ‘foreigners’ for what was clearlya piece of Arab real estate. Nonetheless well-armed and experienced Jewishmilitias seized Arab villages that were given to Arabs by the UN, easilycrushing badly armed and untrained Arab villagers. At this point, Secretary ofState George C. Marshall, a highly respected five-star general and staunchopponent of the UN plan, asked Truman in no uncertain terms to reconsider hissupport for a Jewish state.When the British announced their withdrawal from Palestine to be effective atmidnight on 14 May 1948 (without even waiting for the final outcome of events inthe UN) the conflict had already spread all over Palestine, and five Arabcountries, including Egypt and Jordan, now openly threatened to send theirarmies across the border to ‘kill the new born Jewish state at birth’. The StateDepartment strongly urged Truman not to recognize Israel, at least notimmediately, but rather to support the prevailing view at the UN for a UN‘trusteeship’. So why didn't he listen to such wise advice? To understand this,it is important to appreciate the pivotal role played by Clark Clifford, thenTruman's political adviser for domestic affairs, in counteracting and eventuallyoverriding Secretary Marshall's opposition. In Clark Clifford's own words:Marshall firmly opposed American recognition of the new Jewish state; I did not.Marshall's opposition was shared by almost every member of the brilliant and nowlegendary group of presidential advisers, later referred to as the ‘wise men’,who were then in the process of creating a post-war foreign policy that wouldendure for more than 40 years. The opposition included the respected UnderSecretary of State Robert Lovett; his predecessor, Dean Acheson; the No. 3 manin the State Department, Charles Bohlen; the brilliant chief of the PolicyPlanning Staff, George Kennan; (Navy Secretary James V.) Forrestal; and … DeanRusk, then the director of the Office of United Nations Affairs …Officials in the State Department had done everything in their power to prevent,thwart, or delay the president's Palestine policy in 1947 and 1948, while I hadfought for assistance to the Jewish Agency.28[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1744]Clifford then narrates the specific mood and happenings in early May 1948, andmore specifically his own involvement:At midnight on May 14, 1948 [6 p.m. in Washington], the British would relinquishcontrol of Palestine. One minute later, the Jewish Agency, under the leadershipof David Ben-Gurion, would proclaim the new state. I had already had severalserious disagreements with General Marshall's protege, Dean Rusk, and with LoyHenderson, the director of Near Eastern and African Affairs … He [Rusk] had nouse for White House interference in what he saw as his personal domain inAmerican policy in the Middle East. A number of Middle East experts in the StateDepartment were widely regarded as anti-Semitic. On May 7th, a week before the end of the British Mandate, I met with PresidentTruman for our customary private day-end chat … I handed the president a draftof a public statement I had prepared, and proposed that at his next pressconference, scheduled for May 13th, the day before the British Mandate wouldend, he announce that it was his intention to recognize the Jewish state. Thepresident was sympathetic to the proposal, but, being keenly aware of Marshall'sstrong feelings, he picked up the telephone to get the Secretary's views … I could tell that Marshall objected strongly to the proposed statement. Thepresident listened politely, then told Marshall he wanted to have a meeting onthe subject … On ending the conversation, the president swivelled his chairtoward me. ‘Clark, I am impressed with General Marshall's argument that weshould not recognize the new state so fast,’ he said. ‘He does not want torecognize it at all – at least, not now. I’ve asked him and Lovett to come innext week to discuss this business. I think Marshall is going to continue totake a very strong position. When he does, I would like you to make the case infavor of recognition’ … President Truman had asked me to debate the man he most admired, a man whoseparticipation in the administration was essential to its success. I was 41 yearsold, in my third year at the White House as a presidential aide. Virtually everyAmerican regarded General Marshall, then 67, with a respect bordering on awe … At 4 p.m. on Wednesday, May 12 … seven of us joined President Truman in the OvalOffice … President Truman did not raise the issue of recognition; his desire wasthat I be the first to raise it, but only after Marshall and Lovett had spoken,so that he would be able to ascertain the degree of Marshall's opposition beforeshowing his own hand. Lovett began by criticizing what he termed signs ofgrowing ‘assertiveness’ by the Jewish Agency … Marshall interrupted Lovett. He was strongly opposed to the behavior of theJewish Agency, he said. He had met on May 8th with Moshe Shertok [future Israeliprime minister Moshe Sharett], its political representative, and had toldShertok that it was ‘dangerous to base long-range policy on temporary militarysuccess.’ Moreover, Marshall said, he had told Shertok that if the Jews got intotrouble and ‘came running to us for help … there was no warrant to expect helpfrom the United States, which had warned them of the grave risk which they wererunning’ … The United States, he said, should continue to support thoseresolutions in the United Nations which would turn Palestine over to the UN as atrusteeship, and defer any decision on recognition .29[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1745]At that point Clifford presented his own ‘case’, speaking of the 1917 BalfourDeclaration which promised a homeland for the Jews to the Zionist Federation,the terrible events of the Holocaust, and now the chance to have a Jewish nationthat would uphold democracy in the Arab world. However as Clifford made hisargument he had noticed:… Marshall's face reddening with suppressed anger as I talked. When I finished,he exploded. ‘Mr. President, I thought this meeting was called to consider an important andcomplicated problem in foreign policy. I don't even know why Clifford is here.He is a domestic adviser, and this is a foreign-policy matter.’ I will neverforget President Truman's characteristically simple reply: ‘Well, General, he'shere because I asked him to be here.’ Marshall, scarcely concealing his ire,shot back, ‘These considerations have nothing to do with the issue. I fear thatthe only reason Clifford is here is that he is pressing a politicalconsideration with regard to this issue. I don't think politics should play anypart in this.’ Lovett joined the attack. ‘It would be highly injurious to the United Nations toannounce the recognition of the Jewish state even before it had come intoexistence and while the General Assembly is still considering the question.Furthermore, such a move would be injurious to the prestige of the President. Itis obviously designed to win the Jewish vote, but in my opinion it would losemore votes than it would gain.’ Lovett had finally brought to the surface theroot cause of Marshall's fury: his view that the position I presented wasdictated by domestic political considerations … When Lovett concluded his attack, Marshall spoke again. Speaking with great andbarely contained anger and with more than a hint of self-righteousness, he madethe most remarkable threat I have ever heard anyone make directly to apresident. He said, ‘If you follow Clifford's advice and if I were to vote inthe election, I would vote against you.’ Everyone in the room was stunned. Here was the indispensable symbol ofcontinuity, whom President Truman revered and needed, making a threat that, ifit became public, could virtually seal the dissolution of the Trumanadministration and send the Western Alliance, then in the process of creation,into disarray before it had been fully structured. Marshall's statement fellshort of an explicit threat to resign, but it came very close.Clifford further recounts that in the 12 May 1948 meeting:Lovett and I both tried to step into the ensuing silence with words ofconciliation. We both knew how important it was to get this dreadful meetingover with quickly, before Marshall said something even more irretrievable … he[Truman] rose and turned to him and said, ‘I understand your position, General,and I’m inclined to side with you in this matter’ … Marshall did not even glanceat me as he and Lovett left.Clifford claims that after this meeting, Secretary Mashall never mentioned hisname again. He also eventually found out that, at day's end on 12 May 1948,Marshall:… did something quite unusual, which the president and I were unaware of at thetime. Certain that history would prove him right, he wanted his personalcomments included in the official State Department record of the meeting. Hisrecord, exactly as he wanted historians to find it when it was declassified,almost three decades later, reads as follows: ‘I remarked to the president that, speaking objectively, I could not help butthink that the suggestions made by Mr. Clifford were wrong. I thought that toadopt these suggestions would have precisely the opposite effect from thatintended by Mr. Clifford. The transparent dodge to win a few votes would not infact achieve this purpose. The great dignity of the office of the presidentwould be seriously diminished. The counsel offered by Mr. Clifford was based ondomestic political considerations, while the problem which confronted us wasinternational. I said bluntly that if the president were to follow Mr.Clifford's advice and if in the elections I were to vote, I would vote againstthe president.’30 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1746]At this point it is noteworthy that President Truman, judging from his ownsaccounts and that of his biographers, shows that he was undecided over the issueand confused as to what was best to do. Lobbied on the one hand for therecognition of the Jewish state by his White House adviser, David Niles, andTruman's old army colleague and business partner, Eddie Jacobson, and on theother hand by the ‘wise men’ at the State Department, Truman, on face value,seems to have hesitated. Clifford, however, give the impression that, quite tothe contrary, Truman position was set on recognition of the Jewish state. Inother words, his position was inflexible and adamantine. At any rate, everyone,it seems – Clifford, Niles, and even the State Department – were in directcommunication with Eliahu Epstein, the Washington representative of the JewishAgency for Israel (which later was to convert itself into the government of newstate of Israel). As for Clifford himself, here, in his own words, is hisinvolvement on that day of 14 May 1948:Even without a clear signal from Lovett and Marshall, I felt, we had to set inmotion the machinery for recognition, in the event that a favorable decision wasmade. At 10 a.m., I made a different call – one that I looked on later withgreat pleasure … I told the Jewish Agency representative [Epstein], ‘we wouldlike you to send an official letter to President Truman before 12 o'clock todayformally requesting the United States to recognize the new Jewish state. I wouldalso request that you send a copy of the letter directly to Secretary Marshall.’ Epstein was ecstatic. He did not realize that the president had still notdecided how to respond to the request I had just solicited … It was particularlyimportant, I said, that the new state claim nothing beyond the boundariesoutlined in the UN resolution of Nov. 29, 1947, because those boundaries werethe only ones that had been agreed to … A few minutes later, Epstein called me.‘We've never done this before, and we're not quite sure how to go about it,’ hesaid … With my knowledge and encouragement, Epstein then turned for additional adviceto two of the wisest lawyers in Washington, David Ginsburg and Benjamin Cohen,both of whom were great New Dealers and strong supporters of the Zionist cause.Working together during the rest of the morning, he and they drafted therecognition request …31 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1747]Clifford then narrates how a staff member of the Jewish Agency for Israel droveto the White House with the request for recognition of the ‘Jewish state’ butwas intercepted by another member because Epstein had heard on shortwave radiothat the new state was not to be called the ‘Jewish state’ but the ‘state ofIsrael’ and thus instructed that the letter be corrected in ink before handingover the request for recognition to the White House! At any rate, when it becameknown to the American delegation at the UN (the latter then pushing for votingfor continued trusteeship), the US ambassador to the UN, Warren Austin, walkedout of the UN building so as not to be there when US recognition of Israel wasannounced. Dean Rusk thus had to quickly go to the UN Headquarters to persuadethe US delegation members there not to resigning in protest!Marshall did not resign as was previously feared. Lovett had apparently talkedhim out of it. According to Clifford,Lovett remained adamant for the rest of his life, however, in his view that thepresident and I had been wrong. So did most of his colleagues. Nothing couldever convince him, Marshall, Acheson, Forrestal, or Rusk that President Trumanhad made the right decision … Because President Truman was often annoyed by thetone and fierceness of the pressure exerted on him by American Zionists, he leftsome people with the impression that he was ambivalent about the events of May1948. This was not true. He never wavered in his belief that he had taken theright action .32 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1748]Truman's fateful decision led to a situation in which three quarters of amillion Arab-Palestinians were forced to flee their own country as refugeesduring the 1947 – 9 fighting, and subsequently caused five Arab-Israeli wars in1948, 1956, 1967, 1973 and 2006. Had a different decision been taken it seemsprobable that there would have been no ‘Middle East Crisis’, nor the formationof the various terrorist groups such as the PLO, Hezbollah and others that haveresulted in modern times in the dreaded Al Qaeda of Osama Bin Laden, 9/11 andthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.33[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1749]FLASH FORWARD TO 1978: JERUSALEM DAYIn 1978 Ayatollah Khomeini arrived in triumph in Qom, the holy city of the Shi'aMuslims, and pronounced to an ecstatic and frenzied multitude that the IslamicRevolution had begun. A year later, now almost deified by his followers, heannounced the creation of Al-Quds Day, Jerusalem Day:I invite Muslims all over the globe to consecrate the last Friday of the holymonth of Ramadan as Al-Quds Day and to proclaim the international solidarity ofMuslims in support of the legitimate rights of the Muslim people of Palestine.For many years, I have been notifying the Muslims of the danger posed by theusurper Israel … I ask all the Muslims of the world and the Muslim governmentsto join together to sever the hand of this usurper and its supporters [America]… and through a ceremony demonstrating the solidarity of Muslims worldwide,announce their support for the legitimate rights of the Muslim people. I ask GodAlmighty for the victory of the Muslims over the infidels.34[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1750]In solidarity with the Palestinians, Khomeini declared the liberation ofJerusalem a religious duty to all Muslims. The Ayatollah then added:In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Quds Day is aninternational day, it is not a day devoted to Quds alone. It is the day for theweak and oppressed to confront the arrogant powers, the day for those nationssuffering under the pressure of America … The oppressed should arm themselvesagainst the oppressors and rub their noses in the dirt … all the nations shouldrise up and throw these germs of corruption into the rubbish bin too … Quds Day is the day when the superpowers should be warned to stay at home andleave the oppressed alone. Israel, the enemy of mankind, the enemy of humanity,which is creating disturbances every day and is attacking our brothers … Quds Day is the day for announcing such things, for announcing such things tothe Satans who want to push the Islamic nations aside and bring the superpowersinto the arena. Quds Day is the day to dash their hopes and warn them that thosedays are gone … Quds Day is the day of Islam; it is the day when Islam should be revived, so letus revive it and implement Islamic laws in the Islamic countries. Quds Day isthe day when we must warn all the superpowers that they can no longer keep Islamunder their control by means of their evil agents. Quds Day is the day to givelife to Islam. The Muslims must awaken, they must come to realise the power theyhave, the material power and the spiritual. What are the Muslims, who form apopulation of one billion, enjoy divine support and have Islam and their faithbehind them, afraid of? … The governments in the world should know that Islam will not be defeated. Islamand the teachings of the Qur'an should prevail in all countries. Religion shouldbe the religion of God and Islam is the religion of God so it should advance onall regions of the world. Quds Day is the day to announce such a matter, the dayto announce ‘Muslims, advance!’ Advance on all the regions of the world …35[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1751] with our cries and shouts of‘Allah'u Akbar’ [‘God is Great’] …36[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1752]FLASH FORWARD TO 2001: MASONIC OATH?We recall that in 1740 the Chevalier Ramsay, a Scotsman and Jacobean, created aMasonic order in France which he claimed had its roots in the Crusades andwhich, some believe, was the precursor to Scottish Rite Freemasonry – todayheadquartered in Washington, DC. Meanwhile Bin Laden's rhetoric, and thethreats, accusations and attacks against Freemasons cited leave little doubtthat Islamic fundamentalists regard America as a Masonic-crusading power whoseally in the Middle East is Israel.Such perceptions could only have been heightened in January 2001 when thefollowing newspaper article was circulated by the Associated Press:A Bible that George Washington used to take the oath of office as the nation'sfirst president will be used by George W. Bush. Three officials of theManhattan-based St. John's Lodge of the Free and Accepted Masons will board anAmtrak liner for Washington, DC, tomorrow. They'll be carrying the nine-pound,234-year-old King James Bible in a special case. For the sixth time in history,the Bible will be used on Saturday for the swearing in of a US president. GeorgeWashington was the first, in 1789. The last was George H. W. Bush, who used theBible in 1989. Other presidents who have placed their left hand on the MasonicBible were Warren Harding in 1921, Dwight Eisenhower in 1953, and Jimmy Carterin 1977. The Bible was also displayed at the New York World's Fair in 1964 –65.37 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1753]When we consider the symbolic implications of all this for Muslims alreadyparanoid about a supposed Masonic-Zionist plot, a new and extraordinarypossibility presents itself.It is the norm for the entrances to Masonic temples and lodges to be flanked bytwo pillars representing the twin pillars of Solomon's Temple, namely Boaz andJachin – meaning ‘wisdom’ and ‘power’. The so-called Plan of Lodges alsoincorporates these pillars as well as a five-pointed star or pentagonsymbolising the Holy of Holies of Solomon's Temple. Indeed the Temple ofSolomon, and its rebuilding in a spiritual manner, is probably the mostimportant symbol representing the ideal of Freemasonry in the world today.Could it be that the attacks on the Twin Towers at the ‘entrance’ of America,i.e. New York, and on the Pentagon – the ‘Holy of Holies’ of US military power –were intended, at least in part, as a coded symbolic message aimed at imaginedTemplar-crusaders or Zionist-Masons … or both?Was 9/11 the latest move in the millennia-old ‘Master Game’ – a move thatdemonstrates, more than any other, that all the players have now utterly losttheir way?‘JIHAD’ OR ‘CRUSADE’?At a press conference given on the south lawn of the White House on 16 September2001, five days after the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, PresidentGeorge W. Bush said:We need to go back to work tomorrow and we will. But we need to be alert to thefact that these evil-doers still exist. We haven't seen this kind of barbarismin a long period of time … This is a new kind of evil. And we understand. Andthe American people are beginning to understand. This crusade, this war onterrorism is going to take a while. And the American people must be patient. I’mgoing to be patient. But I can assure the American people I am determined, I’mnot going to be distracted, I will keep my focus to make sure that not only arethese brought to justice, but anybody who's been associated will be brought tojustice … It is time for us to win the first war of the 21st century decisively,so that our children and our grandchildren can live peacefully into the 21stcentury.38 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1754]On 16 February 2002, the president used the same rhetoric:I want to tell you something, we've got no better friends than Canada. Theystand with us in this incredibly important crusade to defend freedom, thiscampaign to do what is right for our children and our grandchildren.39[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1755] [Emphasis added]On 7 September 2002, Counterpunch editor Alexander Cockburn published an articletitled ‘The Tenth Crusade’ in which he wrote:Islamic fanatics flew those planes a year ago and here we are with a terrifyingalliance of Judaeo-Christian fanatics, conjoined in their dreams of the recoveryof the Holy Lands of the West Bank, Judaea and Samaria.

The West is no longer‘Christendom,’ but we, as first cousins to the Europeans, retain the old faithand bring new kinds of idealism, such as democracy and human rights. But theCrusader spirit is still there; it's still about bringing civilization andsalvation of a backward people. As the born-again George W. Bush says, ‘This isabout good vs. evil.’41 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1757]FROM THE CRUSADES TO AL QAEDAIn November 2010, a spine-chilling statement was made on Internet by theself-styled Islamic state of Iraq (ISI), Al Qaeda's front in Iraq:[ISI] declares all Christian centers, organizations and institutions, leadersand followers, are legitimate targets for Mujahideen [Muslim holy warriors]wherever they can reach them … The killing sword will not be lifted from thenecks of the [Vatican leaders] and their followers until they declare theirinnocence from what the Egyptian Church is doing.42[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1758]Al Qaeda's allegation was that Muslim women ‘were being held against their willin Coptic Christian monasteries in Egypt’.43[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1759] Although the charge sounds mostimprobable, the gruesome inevitable soon happened. On 31 October 2010, justhours after the ‘statement’ was put on the Internet, a group of fanatical SIS‘Muslim Warriors’ stormed into the Our Lady of Salvation church in the Karradaneighborhood of central Baghdad. A hundred hostages were taken and the wholebizarre incident ended with the death of 58 people. Threats were then madedirectly towards Christian churches in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East.In a garbled ‘good-cop, bad-cop’ reaction, the official Muslim Brotherhood inEgypt (ironically, the root organization from which Islamic Jihad, Hamass and AlQaeda all sprang) quickly issued a statement:The Muslim Brotherhood is stressing to all, and primarily Muslims, that theprotection of Holy Places of all monotheistic religions is the mission of themajority of Muslims … The Brotherhood rejects all stupid threats againstChristian places of worship in Egypt by anyone and under any pretext.44[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1760]On face value the Muslim Brotherhood must be lauded for its swift condemnationof such threats and attacks on Christian establishments. Yet it is well knownthat for the past 60 years the Copts (Christians) of Egypt, have suffered almostcontinuous persecution at the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood. An exodus ofalmost biblical proportions has taken place and huge numbers of Copts have fledEgypt to settle in the Western world .45[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1761]Meanwhile in Baghdad a series of booby-trap bomb attacks on Christian familiestook place in November 2010 in the days after the terrible massacre at the OurLady of Salvation church. According to the Guardian newspaper, Christians inIraq now regret the downfall of Saddam Hussein, saying that ‘for all hisatrocities, the dictator left the Christians alone’. According to one ChristianIraqi woman, Linda Jalal:We didn't suffer under him [Saddam Husein]. But now I am terrified to live inthis society. We are being slaughtered like sheep. Yet we are civilians in ourcountry.46 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1762]And on 31 December 2010, as hundreds of Copts were coming out of a church in theSidi Bishr district of Alexandria, a powerful carbomb exploded killingtwenty-one people and injuring dozens of others. Unconfirmed reports indicatedthat Al Qaeda was behind this murderous act following its recent threat againstChristians.Infuriated by this act of senseless terrorism, Christian youths in Alexandriawent on a rampage and attacked a nearby local mosque. Mayhem followed assectarian tension was pushed to breaking point. And although the riot police wasable to restore calm, a very uneasy mood fell across the whole of Egypt.47[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1763]Not only in Iraq and Egypt, but across the Middle East and indeed in the Muslimworld as a whole, Christians increasingly live in fear, not knowing when somefanatic might decide to see them as a ‘legitimate target’. The corollary is thatin the predominantly Christian West, Muslims are now regarded with ever growingsuspicion as they go about their daily lives. If there was any doubt that whatis going on is a modern religious crusade, these recent troubling incidents havesettled the matter.Yet this is not the end; and in the famous words of Winston Churchill, ‘It isnot even the beginning of the end.’ There will unfortunately be more suchgruesome attacks, perhaps not only by Muslim fanatics on Christian ‘targets’ butalso by Christian (or Jewish) fanatics on Muslim ‘targets’.Unless the ‘crusading’ undercurrent to these events is understood, andsuccessfully defused, the root of the problem will persist, and will continue tocreate new factions, even if Al Qaeda is totally eliminated. In the somber wordsof Dr. Lucy-Anne Hunt, head of the School of History of Art and Design atManchester Metropolitan University:The motif of the crusader is an integral element of the historical memory. Amongthe Muslims, it will evoke reminiscences of crimes committed by the West in thepast within seconds. On both sides, it has a reliably polarizing effect anddemonizes the enemy. And it suggests that aggressive action is justified sinceit is willed by God … President Bush referred to it when opting for the recentwar in Iraq. This appeal to Godgiven authority fits in with the simple choicegiven here: if you're not with us, you're against us. Conversely, in theirattacks on Western targets, extreme Muslim groups have also accepted casualtiesamong Muslims, as in the London bombings … This polarization demonstrates thatthe need for ongoing dialogue and negotiation, albeit a painstaking and slowprocess, is ever more crucial.48[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1764]In other words, God must be made to step aside in this ever-growing conflict,and secular moderate heads of state must begin to speak out and drum some senseinto the religious leaders and radical groups on both sides. This is the firstand major step in stopping this runaway train that is slowly but surely leadingus all into a world conflict which no nation, no religious group, nor even thehuman race as a whole can win."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXTHE GREAT PYRAMID AND FREEMASONRY(Publisher's note: much of the information in this appendix is culled fromRobert Bauval's book, Secret Chamber: The Quest for the Hall of Records, Chapter8).MILLENNIUM MADNESS AND THE GREAT PYRAMIDAmid accusations of a ‘Zionist’ plot and ‘Masonic’ machinations, the Egyptiangovernment cancelled the placing of a golden capstone on top of the GreatPyramid of Giza scheduled for the eve of the new millennium at midnight on 31December 1999.Oddly enough, the strange circumstances that led to this bizarre scandal hadtheir origins in France on 14 May 1998 when a golden capstone was unveiled ontop of the ancient Egyptian obelisk at the Place de la Concorde in Paris.Guests of honor at the ceremony included Egypt's ambassador to France, Dr. Maherel Sayed, French minister of culture and communication, Catherine Trautmann andother dignitaries. The event took place during an official visit of EgyptianPresident Hosni Mubarak to France, with Egypt's minister of culture, FaroukHosni, and the antiquities’ chairman, Dr. Ali Gaballah in attendance. Acommemorative plaque was fixed on the base of the obelisk which reads:This obelisk, offered by Egypt to France in 1830, to serve eternally as a bondbetween the two countries, has been dressed by its pyramidion of origin on 14May 1998, under the presidency of Jacques Chirac in the presence of CatherineTrautmann, minister of culture and communication, and Dr. Maher El Sayed,ambassador of Egypt for the occasion of the Year France-Egypt ‘Shared Horizons’and the visit of the president of the Arab Republic of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak. Themonument thus restored is dedicated to Jean-François Champollion, founder ofEgyptology, who chose it from the temple of Luxor. This pyramidion is realizedthanks to the support of Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Bergé and the House of YvesSaint Laurent.1 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1765]The name of the famous fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent and his ex-loverPierre Bergé naturally attracted our attention. There was much controversy onthe internet surrounding Yves Saint Laurent regarding a very weird publicationhe was involved with in 1967, namely a type of comic book for children titled LaVilaine Lulu which has be described as a Satanic-cum-Masonic manual by advocatesof conspiracy theories and the so-called Illuminati. The book concerns a younggirl called Lulu who, among other warped actions, goes around decapitating,hanging and burning people. As for Pierre Bergé, we discovered a very intriguingconnection with Zionism that, to say the very least, makes his name on theobelisk's plaque most disturbing. Bergé is one of France's most notoriousbillionaires and philanthropists, as well as having once been a keen and activesupporter of François Mitterrand during his presidential campaigns. Co-founderof the Yves Saint Laurent empire and one-time director of the Paris Opera, Bergéis a well know patron of the arts and, partly because of his Jewish faith, astaunch crusader against anti-Semitism. Bergé is the founder of the MuséeDreyfus at the Maison Zola, opening in 2012.The Musée Dreyfus, as the name implies, is dedicated to Alfred Dreyfus, a Frenchartillery officer of Alsatian Jewish origins who, in 1894, was condemned to lifeimprisonment by a military court for allegedly spying for Germany. This famous‘Dreyfus Affair’ exposed the obvious anti-Semitism in France at the time andsplit the nation into a huge controversial debate when the writer Émile Zolapublished his celebrated open letter ‘J’accuse …!’ in the French newspaperL’Aurore in January 1898. It is also well-known that the Dreyfus Affair was thecatalyst that was to give birth to Zionism. This happened when Theodore Herzl,then a young journalist and the Paris correspondent for the German newspaperNeue Freie Presse, followed the story of Alfred Dreyfus and was so incensed withthe anti-Semitism that surrounded the affair and the French crowd's chanting‘death to the Jews’ that he organized the First Zionist Congress in Basel,Switzerland, in 1897. The connection of Pierre Bergé with the Dreyfus Affair,and his involvement in 1998 with the bizarre ceremony at the Place de laConcorde in Paris when a golden capstone was placed on the Egyptian obeliskmakes the choice date, i.e. 14 May 1998 (the 50-year jubilee of the State ofIsrael), unlikely to be a ‘coincidence’.2[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1766]This authentic ancient Egyptian obelisk, as we have seen in Chapter 1, was takenfrom the temple of Luxor in Upper Egypt in 1831 under the orders of Charles X,and raised in the Place de la Concorde in 1836 in celebrations attended by acrowd of more than 200,000 people. Charles X was a staunch Freemason, and it was(and still is) suspected it was the Masonic lodges that were really behind thebringing of the obelisk to France, as was also the case with those obeliskslater taken out of Egypt to London and New York by British and AmericanFreemasons.The ‘London’ obelisk, or Cleopatra's Needle as it is more commonly known inBritain, was commissioned and paid for by a prominent Freemason, Sir ErasmusWilson, and the raising ceremony was attend by hundreds of Freemasons inSeptember 1878 under the auspices of the Prince of Wales, the Grand Master ofthe United Grand Lodge of England.That same year former US President Ulysses S. Grant3[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1767] and General William T. Shermansuggested, during a trip to Egypt, that America should also have an ancientEgyptian obelisk.4 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1768] HenryHonychurch Gorringe,5 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1769] aprominent American Freemason, was selected for the task of bringing the obeliskto New York. The obelisk was raised in October 1880 outside the newly builtMetropolitan Museum of Art, with nearly ten thousand Freemasons attending theceremony in full Masonic regalia.6[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1770]It is one of those strange coincidences of history that on 14 May 1998, whenPresident Mubarak and his retinue attended the capping of the obelisk in thePlace de la Concorde, huge celebrations were simultaneously underway in Tel Avivmarking the 50-year jubilee of the Declaration of the State of Israel. On thesame day Egyptian culture minister Farouk Hosni told the French press that aceremony similar to the capping of the obelisk would take place in Egypt for themillennial celebrations at which point a golden capstone would be placed on theGreat Pyramid of Giza:We cannot rebuild the pyramids stone by stone, so we have chosen a symbolicevent like the ancient Egyptians did when they used to cap obelisks [and] likewhat the French did at the Place de la Concorde.7[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1771]Later in October 1998 Farouk Hosni announced to the Egyptian press that Frenchcomposer Jean Michel Jarre had been commissioned to organize this event at Giza.The Egyptian Tourist Authority announced that Jarre would compose an operatitled The Twelve Dreams of the Sun for the sum of 10 million US dollars andthat,At midnight a helicopter will fly into the site and, hovering in a starburst oflasers and spotlights, will place a gigantic gilded capstone atop the GreatPyramid – all to the accompaniment of what is expected to be an unprecedentedJarre crescendo of electronic music. The gold cap, approximately 28 feet high(about the size of a two-story house) is being especially constructed to protectthe pyramid structure. In place, it will catch the first light of the newmillennium as the sun rises over Egypt. Capping pyramids with gold and timingimportant events to the setting and rising sun are very much part of the ancientEgyptian pharaonic tradition, making this piece of Jarre theatre particularlymeaningful.8 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1772]Let us note that back in July 1989 Jean Michel Jarre had organized a somewhatsimilar event in Paris for the bicentennial of the French Revolution when he setup a large metal-framed pyramid as a stage for his band in front of the GrandeArche at La Defense at the western end of the Champs-Élysées. Another show byJarre also took place a few years later in London's Canary Wharf which is toppedby a glowing glass pyramid apparently having the same geometrical proportions asthe Great Pyramid in Egypt like the one that stands in the courtyard of theLouvre Museum in Paris, built by the architect I. M. Pei.It would appear that the idea of placing a golden capstone on the Great Pyramidoriginated with Dr. Zahi Hawass, at the time director-general of the Gizamonuments. It seems that a few months before the May 1998 celebrations Hawasshad unearthed two limestone blocks with ancient inscriptions and drawingsdepicting workers moving a capstone for a royal pyramid amid scenes of dancingand celebrations. Inspired by this, Hawass proposed that Egypt should celebratethe millennium in a similar fashion. At first three million people werescheduled to attend the event but the Egyptian authorities put a limit of250,000 for security reasons. A massive worldwide promotional campaign wasorganized including New York, Los Angeles, Sydney and various cities in Europe.Preparations then began for a huge stage to be erected in the desert south ofthe Great Pyramid with seating capacity for VIPs.All was apparently going to plan until, in September 1999, senior members of theEgyptian Parliament began to complain of the costs involved and also that themillennium celebrations coincided that particular year with the holy month ofRamadan when devout Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. To counteract suchcriticism, culture minister Farouk Hosni stated that a ban would be placed onalcohol during the celebrations and that no music would be played until afterthe official end of the fast was announced.To add fuel to this political fire, the radical Egyptian press, notably thenewspaper Sawt al-Shaab (‘Voice of the People’) reported that Jean Michel Jarrewas Jewish and also that he intended to project an ‘eye’ among many other imageson the Great Pyramid using laser beams. The upshot was that Sawt al-Shaabaccused the organizers of staging a ‘Masonic’ event in collusion with the‘Jews’. The newspaper claimed that the ‘eye in the pyramid’ planned for thisceremony was intended to evoke the well-known Masonic symbol of the ‘eye in thetriangle’ and, more specifically, the ‘Eye of Providence’ seen on the USone-dollar bill (and also in the ‘Great Seal of the United States’, suspected tobe of Masonic significance).More such accusations of ‘Masonic-Zionist’ infiltration of the millennium partyat Giza ensued in the Arab press, although hotly denied by Farouk Hosni as‘groundless’, and by Dr. Hawass who stated that ‘the celebration has nothing todo with Masonic beliefs. The design on the US dollar is a faulty imitation ofthe Pyramids of the Middle Kingdom.’9[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1773]Adding to the growing hype was another bizarre twist to this strange story. Thisinvolved the so-called ‘prophecies’ made by American psychic Edgar Cayce knownas the ‘Sleeping Prophet’, who died in 1945. It turns out that Cayce foretoldthe placing of a gilded capstone on the Great Pyramid and also associated theevent with the establishment of a sort of ‘new world order’ based on Masonicprinciples:For with those changes that will be wrought, Americanism with the universalthought that is expressed and manifest in the Brotherhood of man into groupthought as expressed in the Masonic Order, will be the eventual rule in thesettlement of affairs in the world. Not that the world is to become a MasonicOrder, but the principles that are embraced in the same will be the basis uponwhich the new order of peace is to be established …10[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1774]It is well known in Egyptological circles that since 1973 the Edgar CayceFoundation has been involved in various archaeological expeditions at Giza tofind the fabled ‘Hall of Records’.11[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1775]In 1996 – 7 much controversy surrounded the precise relationship of the EdgarCayce Foundation and the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, withallegations that prominent members of the organization arranged for theuniversity education of Zahi Hawass, then chief inspector of the Giza pyramidsAll these allegations and rumours reached a peak in early December 1999, andfinally under heavy pressure from the Egyptian press and also from members ofParliament, the Supreme Council of Antiquities took a face-saving position bydelegating the decision of placing the golden capstone to a scientificcommittee. Hawass stated that the capstone, which apparently was to be made froman 8-meter high light metal frame and covered in gold sheets, could not belowered by a helicopter ‘… because it will hurt the pyramid. Therefore if wefind out that putting this capstone will hurt the pyramid, then, we will not doit.’ But some critics rightly pointed out a lightweight capstone on the 6million ton stone pyramid would be like placing a flea on an elephant's back.Finally the Egyptian minister of culture caved in and, at the eleventh hour,admitted that due to public outrage over the ‘Masonic’ and ‘Zionist’implications the placing of the golden capstone would be scrapped, but the showwould go on just the same.Ironically on the night of 31 December a thick fog settled over the GreatPyramid which would have anyway made it impossible for the helicopter to lowerthe capstone on its summit. Jean Michel Jarre did, however, manage to projecthis images on the Giza pyramids including ‘eyes’ until they, too, were engulfedby the fog and the thick smoke caused by the smoke of the huge firework display.THE ONE-EYED FIENDAlthough the alleged Masonic-Zionist conspiracy is generally seen as a secularevil, the Freemasons, as we saw in Chapter Twenty, are often associated with themysterious and satanic figure of Masih ad-Dajjal, a supernatural entity akin toa ‘false prophet’ or a ‘false messenger’ who, in Muslim lore, is supposed toappear before Yawm al-Qiyamah (the ‘Day of Judgment’). In the Koran the Dajjalhas a single eye which is inevitably associated to the single eye in the pyramidon the US one-dollar bill and, of course, the ‘eye in the triangle’ inFreemasonry and also Judaic symbolism.It was thus no surprise that a few days before the planned millenniumcelebrations at the Giza pyramids, Sawt al-Shaab accused culture minister FaroukHosni of allowing the ‘Jew’ Jean Michel Jarre to present a ‘Masonic-Zionist’event on the soil of Egypt to be seen live on television on a global scale bybillions of viewers. The newspaper printed a large composite image showing aFreemason with a huge eye (clearly representing the Dajjal) on whose chest waspinned the Star of David and the Masonic triangle. Yet Farouk Hosni and ZahiHawass are themselves not immune to fictitious Israeli and Jewish plots againstEgypt and the Arab World in general. In 1997 Farouk Hosni told the Arab press:The Israelis do not stop claiming that they built the pyramids, and this is whywe need to stand firmly and respond courageously … even if it leads to a crisisbecause those pirates are committing a robbery … The Israelis want everything …This is the way the Israelis took Palestine … Now they use [this method]regarding the big pyramid. These are continuous projects – people come, stealyour history and civilization. This proves that Israel has no history orcivilization, since those who have history of their own do not need to rob thehistory of others … Israel has many political goals … First of all, they stealyour civilization and history. Second, they do not have any civilization … theydo not have a country, and do not deserve a country. This is why they create acountry by force …12 [36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1776]To which Zahi Hawass added:A group of people are making an organized campaign. There are some peoplepushing them [Israel] … These people are waging a big attack against us. I sworetwo years ago that I would not reveal their names, but I found out that I mustmention them because it is becoming a threat.13[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1777]A few years later, on 17 September 2002, a small robot was used to explorenarrow shafts in the Great Pyramid of Giza. The exploration was aired on a‘live’ TV show by the National Geographic Channel with an estimated 300 millionviewers watching. After the show Hawass told bemused journalists at a pressconference at the Mena House Oberoi:The results of the robot's exploration refute the allegations reiterated by Jewsand some Western countries that the Jews built the pyramids! … and I will tell the public that everyone who tries to talk against theEgyptians should shut their mouths!14[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1778]In a more recent television appearance in February 2009 Hawass seemed almost tobe quoting from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, those fake documents thatclaim to expose a Masonic-Zionist plot to control the Arab world, when he toldthe interviewer that,… For eighteen centuries they [the Jews] were dispersed throughout the world …they went to America and took control of its economy … they have a plan:Although they are few in number, they control the entire world … look at thecontrol they have over America and the media!15[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1779]Paradoxically, in view of the above, it was announced in early 2009 that FaroukHosni was the prime candidate to be the new head of the United NationsEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO.) Not unexpectedlyworldwide protests ensued when it was revealed that in May of the previous yearHosni had told an Islamist politician that he would ‘personally burn any Israelibooks he found in an Egyptian library’. The French-based Reporters WithoutBorders wrote that ‘Farouk Hosni has been one of the main forces for censorshipin Egypt, trying unfailingly to control press freedom, as well as citizens’freedom of information’. The Independent of Ireland was even more forthright:To put such a creature in charge of the UN body for science, education andculture might seem rather like appointing a bull as manager of a china shop.16[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1780]Ultimately the UNESCO job went to Bulgarian ambassador to France, Irina Bokova.This decision, however, was seen by the Arab press as ‘a sign of Westernprejudice against Islam and the Arab world, the product of an internationalJewish conspiracy.’‘America, Europe and the Jewish lobby brought down Farouk Hosni’ was theheadline in the Egpytian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm, while Egyptian foreignminister Ahmed Aboul Gheit accused ‘international Judaism and Western powers’ ofplotting against Hosni. As for Farouk Hosni himself, he was quoted as saying:‘there was a group of the world's Jews who had a major influence in theelections and who were a serious threat to Egypt taking this position.’17[36_grah_9781934708750_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en1781]"},{"pageContent":"ENDNOTESPREFACE: THE MASTER GAME INTRODUCTION: THE GAME OF GAMES1 [09_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en1] Sir Walter Scott (trans.),Hermetica: The Ancient Greek and Latin Writings Which Contain Religious orPhilosophic Teachings Ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus, Kessinger Publishing,Kila, MT, 1995, pp. 341 – 5.PROLOGUE: THE SACRED CITIES CHAPTER ONE: BEHIND THE VEILS1 [11_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en2] Jean Duché.

And Philip, sometime after he was married, dreamt that he sealed up his wife's body with a seal,whose impression, as be fancied, was the figure of a lion. Some of the divinersinterpreted this as a warning to Philip to look narrowly to his wife; butAristander of Telmessus, considering how unusual it was to seal up anything thatwas empty, assured him the meaning of his dream was that the queen was withchild of a boy, who would one day prove as stout and courageous as a lion.’Astrology was extremely popular in ancient Greece and, especially, in theMacedonian court where Alexander was born. It is little surprise, then, thathoroscopic astrology appears to have been created and nurtured in Alexandria.After Alexsander's invasion of Egypt an important school of astrology wasestablished in the city of Alexandria. Here Babylonian and Greek astrology fusedwith the sky-religion of the Egyptian, and gave rise to type of astrology weknow today as horoscopic (the influence of stars and planets on terrestrialmatters and the lives of men). Although most of it was written in Greek, thelingua franca of that period, many of the authors were not Greeks but Egyptians.It is th is Alexandrian type of astrology which would form the basis of Greekastrological writings which flourished in later centuries.

However, in Carlos Gilly'sarticle ‘Campanella fra i Rosacroce’ in Tommaso Campanella e l'attesa del secoloaureo, Fondazione Luigi Firpo, Florence, 1998, pp. 107 – 55, Carlos Gilly arguesthat Tobias Adami did not bring copies of Campanella's manuscripts to Germanytill after 1610 when the Rosicrucian Fama manifesto (another work by Andreae)were already written. Gilly quotes Ole Worm's ‘Laurea philosophica summa’published in Copenhagen 1619, where the author reports that he had known of theManifesto in 1611, that is before it was publicly put to the press and thuscould not have been influenced by Campanella's ideas. This argument, in myopinion is weak. Civitas Solis was written in 1602, and surely its content, ifnot actual physical copies, were probably known to Andreae and his entouragebefore the writing of the Manifesto; otherwise why would Tobias Adami risksmuggling them out of the Inquisition prison in Naples to take to Andreae? Andwhy would Wense suggest to Andreae to name his utopian boo k Civitas Solis?59 [25_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c14_r1.html#Ref-en1010] J. P.

And there is no oneperson was more acutely aware of this dangerous rift between the Christianfactions than Cardinal Richelieu in Paris, who was in charge of both thereligious as well as the affairs of state of France. Richelieu was constantlyvigilant of the religious tension in France and the terrible civil war that thishad cause in the not-too-distant past. And although the French court wasintensely Catholic, especially after the union of Louis XIII and Anne ofAustria, it was nonetheless well known that one of Richelieu's great ambitionswas to end the papal-Habsburg-Spanish hegemony on central Europe. In his firstyears in office Richelieu surprised everyone with his ruthless determination tooppose these forces by taking quick and decisive military action against thepapal forces in the Swiss canton of Grisons. This had sent a clear message toall those who were under the illusion that Richelieu was the unequivocaldefender of Roman Catholicism and the Catholic League. His biggest politicalchallenge came in 1630 when the Queen Mother, the hysterically staunch CatholicMarie de’Medici, incited her weak son, Louis XIII, to dismiss Richelieu. In amoment of uncharacteristic show of strength, Louis XIII refused to obey her and,instead, had her banished from court. This crucial decision that was to changethe course of French history is known as the ‘night of the dupes’, an allusionto how Richelieu's astute political acumen had even duped the regents of France.Richelieu confused many with his shifting foreign policies, for on the one handhe dealt severely with Protestant Huguenot uprisings such as the one at LaRochelle after they sided with the English Protestants in 1628, and on the otherhand he delivered equal severity towards the Catholic League when, for example,in 1635 he sided France with the Protestants during the Thirty Years War. Suchacts earned him the hatred of both the Catholics and the Protestant extremistsand generated an endless conflict between him and the pope in Rome. Immenselywealthy, Richelieu was an avid patron of the arts, and was himself a playwrightand musician of some talent. The Académie Française, which he founded when hewas fifty-three years old, was his pride and joy. Could Richelieu have beensomewhat sympathetic to a new ‘Christian’ movement such as the Rosicrucianmovement in Germany that sought to bring about a universal reform? Did heencourage individuals like Decarte to form a somewhat similar society in Franceto promote ‘natural philosophy’ as an antidote to the religious mania in Europe?These are extremely provocative and speculative questions that, nonetheless,require further investigation.80 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1098] Yates, ‘Considérations deBruno et de Campanella sur la monarchie française’, p. 12.81 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1099] Lomas, op. cit., p. 114 –6.82 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1100] She died a year after theymarried, in January 1653, while giving birth to a stillborn child; Moray washeartbroken and never remarried.83 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1101] Data from CaliforniaFreemason, ‘The First Initiation on English Soil’, October/ November 2001,available at: www.cafreemason-digital.com [http://www.cafreemason-digital.com].84 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1102] Yates, The RosicrucianEnlightenment, p. 185; the actual translation in English was not Vaughan's.85 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1103] Dudley Wright, ‘The FirstInitiation’ in The Builder, 1921.86 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1104] Lomas, op. cit. p. 250.For details on Preston see Pick & Knight, op. cit., p. 97.87 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1105] Adrian Tin n iswood, HisInvention So Fertile: A Life of Christopher Wren, Jonathan Cape, London, 2001,p. 108.88 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1106] Ibid., p. 109.89 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1107] It might have been thesame comet after it had passed the Sun; see Tinniswood, op. cit., p. 112.90 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1108] Ibid., p. 115.91 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1109] Fraser, op. cit., p. 237.92 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1110] Lomas, op. cit., chapter2.93 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1111] Pick & Knight, op. cit.,pp. 50 – 1.94 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1112] Piatigorsky, op. cit., p.209; Jasper Ridley, The Freemasons, Constable & Co., London, 1999, p. 23;Bernard Williamson & Michael Baigent, ‘Sir Christopher Wren and Freemasonry: NewEvidence’, in Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol.

The whole operation took nearly a year to complete.Fontana employed traditional methods, with the only real innovation over theancient Egyptians being the use of horses instead of just sheer manpower. On thesurface, the pope's motivation was the aesthetic improvement of the Vatican'sPiazza, but a more profound purpose was the display of the growing power of thepapacy in line with that of the ancient Roman emperors who had brought theseEgyptian trophies to Rome more than sixteen centuries earlier. It is true thatmoving the obelisk to its new location was visually important to the Basilica;but the whole affair was an overt way for Sixtus V to draw the obvious parallelbetween the ancient emperors and the papacy. And like these emperors andpharaohs of old, Sixtus V granted Fontana extraordinary powers to commandeer anylabour, any tools and any materials required for the task of raising the greatobelisk. Fontana also had full papal authority to demolish any houses thathappened to be in the way. And the pope made it clear that opposition orobstruction to the project by anyone could result in a huge fine and even thepunishment of death. Indeed, during the final stage of raising the obelisk intoplace, Sixtus V gave strict orders that everyone in the huge crowd of spectatorsthat had come to watch should remain totally silent. The penalty for breakingthis order, the pope declared, was death. The story goes that at one stage theropes holding the obelisk were about to break under the huge strain. And so aGenoese sailor bravely ignored the pope's command and shouted: ‘Put water on theropes!’, thus probably saving the monument from destruction. After the obeliskwas safely raised into place, the crowds were finally allowed to cheer.106 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1124] Peter Tompkins, The Magicof Obelisks, Harper & Row, New York, 1981, p. 36.107 [26_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c15_r1.html#Ref-en1125] The name Champs-Élysées,i.e. the Elysian Fields (a concept which originated in ancient Egypt as theDuat), for the main avenue/axis of Paris can be traced to the epoch of LouisXIV, towards the end of his reign (see Marc Gaillard, Les Belles Heures desChamps-Elysées, Editions Martelle, Paris, 1990, p. 11).

The absolutist ideology underlying the planning of Sixtine Rome,which Louis XIV and André Le Nôtre were currently putting to such good use inthe laying out of Versailles, was here called into service to pay homage tomercantilism. Trade was to be the new religion.’ That the Royal Exchange wasThomas Gresham's brainchild, and that his own home had probably served as aMasonic lodge prior to becoming the home of the Royal Society may also have hadsomething to do with the symbolism intended in Wren's scheme.111 [27_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c16_r1.html#Ref-en1244] This idea was firstproposed by Adrian Gilbert in op. cit., p. 205.

The name “DeMolay” comes from a13th century French hero and martyr named Jacques De Molay, who was the lastGrand Master of a order of chivalric knights known as the Knights Templar … Bebetween the ages of 12 and 21, believe in a Supreme Being (God), be of goodmoral character, Petition a DeMolay. Local groups of DeMolays are calledchapters and are sponsored by a group of Masons or Masonic lodges.’ In 1919, aKansas City freemason named Frank S. Land, noticed a need for a young men'sorganization in the Kansas City area. After meeting with a local youth namedLouis Lower, Land arranged a meeting with several other area youths at theKansas City Scottish Rite building. With Land's guidance and the ambition of theyoung men, the Order of DeMolay was born. Almost instantaneously, the popularityof the new order grew and in no time at all, there were chapters in every statein the union and soon there were even chapters abroad. For over 75 years now,the Order of DeMolay has continued to teach it's member's the basic principlesof life which will help prepare any young man for a good and clean manhood, andwhich will help them to develop a greater love and respect for their God,parents and country. In its history, the Order of DeMolay has boasted a strongmembership and has long lists of successful and influential members.27 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1273] ‘What is Freemasonry?’,United Grand Lodge of England, text reproduced by the Lodge of Harmony, no. 1411at www.harmony1411.cl/freemasonry.html[http://www.harmony1411.cl/freemasonry.html].28 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1274] I Kings 5 – 6; IIChronicles 2 – 6.29 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1275] Sinclair, op. cit., p.158.30 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1276] For a detailed criticalappraisal of these rituals, see Lawrence, op. cit., pp. 92 – 107.31 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1277] Martin Short, Inside theBrotherhood, Grafton Books, London, 1989, p. 93.32 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1278] Lawrence, op. cit., pp. 51– 61.33 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1279] Ibid.34 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1280] Humbert, op. cit., p. 117.35 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1281] Short, op. cit., p. 115.36 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1282] Ibid., p. 123.37 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1283] Stephen Knight, TheBrotherhood, Grafton Books, London, 1985, pp. 236 – 9.38 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1284] Short, op. cit., p. 104.39 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1285] ‘Geometry wherefore Ithinke that science most worthy that fyndeth all others’, cited in Pick &Knight, op. cit., p. 32.40 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1286] For a full account ofPythagoras in Egypt, see Schwaller de Lubicz, op. cit., p. 259.41 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1287] See also Genesis 4 – 20.42 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1288] Pick & Knight, op. cit.,p. 32.43 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1289] Ibid., pp. 32 – 3.44 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1290] Ibid.45 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1291] Naudon, op. cit., p. 64.46 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1292] Ibid., p. 72.47 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1293] Ibid., p. 74.48 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1294] Ibid., pp. 74 – 6.49 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1295] François Ribadeau-Dumas,Cagliostro: homme de lumière, Editions Philosophiques, Paris, 1981, p. 25.50 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1296] Gérard Galtier, Maçonnerieégyptienne, Rose-Croix et Neo-Chevalerie: Les Fils de Cagliostro, Editions duRocher, Paris, 1989, p. 29.51 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1297] Ibid. p. 35; Masonichistorians, however, still do not seem to be able to agree where had taken placeCagliostro initiation into Freemasonry.

When hewas fifty years old, Pernety left the Benedictine order and settled at Avignon.There he directed his earlier alchemical interests into Freemasonry and createdthe so-called Rite Hermétique. He then moved to Berlin and became librarian toFrederick II. In Berlin Pernety translate the works of Swedenborg, the Swedishtheologian and alleged founder of the New Jerusalem Church.55 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1301] Ribadeau-Dumas, op. cit.,p. 50; Naudon, op. cit., p. 92.56 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1302] In 1781, Fredrick II wasinitiated into the Order of The Golden Rose Cross, a German Rosicrucian order,by Johann Woller and Johann Bischoffwerder, two Rosicrucians who were to becomeFredrick's closest advisors (McIntosh, op. cit., p. 95 – 6). The esoteric namegiven to Fredrick II during the initiation rituals was ‘Ormesus Magnus’. TheOrder of the Golden Rose Cross, according to the origins it gave itself, wasallegedly created in Egypt, at Alexandria, by an Egyptian sage called ‘Ormissusor Ormus’ (Galtier, op. cit., p. 164), which is the ‘second name’ given to theimfamous Priere de Sion (M. Baigent, H. Lincoln & R. Leigh, The Holy Blood andthe Holy Grail, p. 123). Ormus, as we shall see later, was also the name givento the founder of the Masonic Rite of Memphis. According to Masonic author ClaraMiccinelli, the name ‘Ormus’ appeared as early as 1753 in a private letterwritten by Prince Raimondo di Sangre de Severo, a Freemason, to the Baron deTchoudi in Paris (C. Miccinelli, E dio Creo L’Uomo e la Massoneria, ECIG,Genova, 1985, p. 73).57 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1303] Ribadeau-Dumas, op. cit.,p. 51.58 [28_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c17_r1.html#Ref-en1304] Ibid.

Then later there is(17) Mid-summer Day, 24 June, dedicated to the birth of the beloved discipleJohn, and corresponding to Christmas Day; there are the festivals of (18) theAssumption of the Virgin (15 August) and of (19) the Nativity of the Virgin (8September), corresponding to the movement of the god through Virgo; there is theconflict of Christ and his disciples with the autumnal asterisms, (20) theSerpent and the Scorpion; and finally there is the curious fact that the Church(21) dedicates the very day of the winter solstice (when any one may verynaturally doubt the rebirth of the Sun) to St. Thomas, who doubted the truth ofthe Resurrection! …In the cathedral, the congregation faces the east in order to pray. It does notface Jerusalem but the east i.e. the direction of the sunrise. This direction ofprayer is almost certainly derived from ancient pagan solar cults. In Christianworship the meaning is somewhat changed. Christ's has many attributes of theancient sun-god, but he is also the Messiah who has come and who will return,another analogy of the death and rebirth of the sun-god in ancient myths. Eastis the place of sunrise, of solar rebirth, of the coming of light. In mysticalreligions the east symbolises spiritual enlightenment and divinity.20 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1337] Norman Lockyer, The Dawnof Astronomy, Cassell & Co., London, 1894, p. 120.21 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1338] Habachi, op. cit., pp. 155– 6.22 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1339] Lockyer, op. cit., pp. 98– 106.23 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1340] Much later, in 1973, theastronomer Gerald S. Hawkins disagreed with Lockyer and asserted that the KarnakTemple had not been aligned to the summer solstice sunset but rather to thewinter solstice sunrise which took place 26° 55’ south-of-east (See GeraldHawkins, Beyond Stonehenge, Arrow Books, London, 1977, chapter 11 ‘Amon-Ra’, pp.193 – 218; see also Ronald L. Reese, ‘Midwinter Sunrise at Karnak’, in Sky &Telescope, March 1992, p. 276). Hawkins is best known for his work on theastronomical alignments of Stonehenge. Hawkins, however, did not carry outactual astronomical observations at Karnak as did Lockyer. He obtained hisorientation angle from survey maps at the Franco-Egyptian Research Centre atLuxor and, like Lockyer before him, calculated the position of the sunrise/setat the solstice rather than actually observe it (Hawkins was in Egypt in May, amonth before the summer solstice). A few years later the astronomer Ed Kruppconfirmed Hawkins's values from actual observations of the sunrise at the wintersolstice from the Karnak Temple (E. C. Krupp, Echoes of Ancient Skies, OxfordUniversity Press, Oxford, 1994, pp. 253 – 7). Hawkins argued that Lockyer'sconclusions were wrong, since the Theban Hills in the distance made it such thatthe setting sun at the summer solstice could not be properly seen through pylonsof the temple. But although it is true to say that the Theban hills in the westpresent an obstacle to us from a practical viewpoint, this reasoning cannot beapplied to the ancient Egyptians's religious viewpoint. To them such physicalobstacles were not an impediment, viz., for example, the so-called false doormade of solid stone often found in tombs and through which the soul of thedeceased was imagined to pass. Egyptian astronomer-priests – and especiallythose assigned to the sun-cult – had been observing the sunrise and sunset atthe solstices long before the construction of Karnak, and there is no questionthat they would have been acutely aware of its maximal and minimal declinations.And so the conclusion by Hawkins that the Theban Hills invalidates the alignmenttowards the summer solstice sunset is not tenable when placed in the religiouscontext of the ancient temple builders (Hawkins, op. cit., p. 198). Hawlkinscommends Lockyer's on the accuracy of his survey at Stonehenge, but says that‘his survey of the Amon-Ra temple was not.’ Hawkins refers to the report by armyengineer P. J. G. Wakefield, who performed a theodolite survey at Karnak forLocker on 21 June 1891. And although it is true that Wakefield reported that theSun could not be seen from any of the points on the axis of the temple marked byLockyer, he did add that he placed the theodolite at the entrance of Pylon 2 andthat he was ‘able to see a portion of the setting sun, the remainder beinghidden behind the south wall of the great pylon (Pylon 1).’ Now the Sun'sdiameter is about 0.5°, which means that it could be ‘shifted’ a further 0.5° tothe north along the horizon, it would be seen between along that part of theaxis running from Pylon 1 to Pylon 2. In c. 1500 BC the Sun was, in fact, 0.5°further north due to the obliquity of the ecliptic at the time. This suggests tome that the orientation of the Karnak Temple might be closer to 26° than the 26°55’ quoted by Hawkins which he got off the map of the Franco-Egyptian Centre.Indeed, Lockyer reported that according to Lepsius and other Egyptologists, theangle was ‘26° or 26° 30” north-of-west. When E.C. Krupp went to verify this, hedid so on the winter solstice, and thus could only verify the alignment at theother end of the temple through the so-called Temple of Ré-Horakhti and the‘High room of the Sun’. In my opinion another survey should be made on 21 Juneto ascertain the statement of army engineer P. J. G. Wakefied. I did, in fact,observe the sunset on June 21, 2003; my conclusion is that the builders aimed atthe sunrise on the winter solstice, but also knew that the sunset at summersolstice would take place in the reverse direction. And although it is true thatthe latter does not fall on the axis alignment but a little short towards thewest, it is obvious that the intention was there.24 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1341] R. Wells, ‘Ré and theCalendar’ in A. J. Spalinger (ed.), Revolution in Time: Studies in AncientEgyptian Calendrics, Van Siclen Books, San Antonio, TX, 1994, p. 19. Ron Wellscalculated that at c. 3500 BC the star Sirius would have risen at exactly thesame spot as the winter solstice sunrise. His computations assume a ‘levelhorizon and no refraction’. My own calculations show that as seen from thelatitude of Cairo today, it would have been seen rising about 29.5°south-of-east. However, in c. 3300 BC, at the foundation date of Dynastic Egypt,it would have risen some 28° south-of-east (Azimuth 118°). A simple calculationshows that at that epoch Sirius had the same declination as the Sun at wintersolstice i.e. about – 24° (that is, 24° south of the celestial equator), andthus performed exactly the same path at the Sun at the winter solstice. It was,quite literally, a ‘second sun’ seen at night in the place of the wintersolstice sun.’ The epoch 3300 BC is extremely significant in that it marks thehistorical begin of Dynastic Egypt, when the whole country was unified under onekingdom.25 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1342] In Roman times the goddessIsis was closely identified and even merged with the Roman goddess Ceres, theGreek Demeter.

Robert Fludd's works (1574 – 1637) is full of the glowingtriangle-pyramid symbol, although he often replaces the ‘eye’ with other symbolsor the words for ‘god’ (see Godwin, Robert Fludd: Hermetic Philosopher andSurveyor of two Worlds). German alchemists and Cabalists used the ‘eye in thepyramid’ symbol profusely in the early 18th century (J. Ritman (ed.), The SilentLanguage, The Symbols of Hermetic Philosophy, In de Pelikaan, Amsterdam 1994,pp. 59 & 75).50 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1367] Godwin, AthanasiusKircher, p. 8.51 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1368] Iversen, op. cit., p. 105,plate XIX.52 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1369] Naudon, op. cit., p. 122.53 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1370] The first design of TheGreat Seal was in July 1776 by Pierre-Eugène Simitière. A drawing made in 1776by pencil on paper by Thomas Jefferson exists in the Library of Congress. The‘eye in the triangle’ can clearly be seen on the top of the Seal. The firstcommittee's choice for the Great Seal, which met on 20 August 1776, was: Ashield with emblems of the six European cultures that migrated to America: threefor Britain (English rose, Scottish thistle, Irish harp) and three forcontinental Europe (French fleur-de-lis, German eagle, Belgic lion). Supportingthe shield: the Goddess of Liberty, who holds a spear and wears the Phrygiancap, and the Goddess of Justice with her balance. Crest: ‘The Eye of Providencein a radiant Triangle whose Glory extends over the Shield and beyond theFigures.’ Motto: ‘E PLURIBUS UNUM.’54 [29_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c18_r1.html#Ref-en1371] The Great Seal FirstCommittee was formed in the afternoon of the 4 July 1776. It comprised BenjaminFranklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Pierre-Eugène Simitière. Each memberproposed various ideas. Franklin's idea was ‘Moses standing on the Shore, andextending his Hand over the Sea, thereby causing the same to overwhelm Pharaohwho is sitting in an open Chariot, a Crown on his Head and a Sword in his Hand.Rays from a Pillar of Fire in the Clouds reaching to Moses, to express that heacts by Command of the Deity.’ Motto: ‘Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience toGod.’ There were several ‘committees’ formed in the course of the next sixyears. The third and final committee was formed on 4 May 1782. Hardly a monthbefore in Paris, on 12 April 1782, a series of peace talks had begun between theUnited States and Britain. America was represented by Benjamin Franklin. The USurgently needed an official sign of sovereignty and coat-of-arms for the signingof the peace treaty. The so-called Third Committee consisted of Chairman ArthurMiddleton and John Rutledge, both of South Carolina, Elias Boudinot of NewJersey and Virginia's Arthur Lee. William Barton, a twenty-eight years oldartist well-versed in the science of heraldry, came up with two complex designswhich were graphic interpretation of the official written description thatprecisely defines the design as follows:Obverse: On the breast of the American bald eagle is a shield with thirteenvertical white and red stripes beneath a blue chief. In the eagle's right talonis an olive branch, and in his left a bundle. In his beak is a scroll inscribedwith the motto ‘E Pluribus Unum’. Over the head of the eagle, a Golden Glory isbreaking through a cloud, and surrounds a constellation of thirteen stars on anazure field.Reverse: In the zenith of an unfinished pyramid is an eye in a trianglesurrounded with a golden glory. Over the eye are the words ‘Annuit Coeptis’.

When the Girondin were defeat at the Convention in June1793 the Hébertists and the Montagnards lost a common enemy, a serious void,since their politics was mostly dependent on blaming another party and launchingfiery verbal attacks on such ‘enemy of the people’. Thus the momentum ofaccusation-styled politics was now deflected on each other, and soon the moodturned quite deadly. Robespierre, siezing an opportunity provided by a hugefraud and spy scandal which was construed to have involved the Hébertists,ordered the arrest of Hébert and Chaumette. They were hastily tried and sent tothe scafold in March 1794. Now with no one left to blame and accuse for theproblems that the Republic was facing, a terrible feud ensued betweenRobespierre and Danton – a feud that was to prove fatal for both men.

Apparently Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagneas Holy Roman emperor in gratitude for having saved him and as well as Rome. Inthe Frankish Royal Annals (Grandes Chroniques de France) it is reported that oneof the Charlemagne's advisers suggested the idea to the pope. According toEinhard, his biographer, as well as other contemporary writers, the coronationactually took Charlemagne by surprise and made him angry. This, say modernscholars, is because Charlemagne considered the pope to be a mere subject of hisvast empire.51 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1470] Pope Pius VII, who hadbeen forced to participate in this charade, was to take his revenge whenNapoleon's empire began to crumble.

He had married a Englishwoman called Sarah andwho, after Belzoni's death, was very active in promoting his Masonic thesis thatthe Egyptian god, Osiris, had been a ‘Freemason’ because he was ‘clad in thedistinctive Masonic apron’ as was obvious, at least to Belzoni and hisfollowers, from depictions on many Egyptian monuments (Short, op. cit., p. 118).It was Belzoni, of all people, who was to discover the magnificent tomb of SethiI, the ‘Sesotris’ that had been the subject of much Masonic controversy inEngland and France. Belzoni, with the help of Henry Salt, had made a full scalefacsimile of this temple and had it shipped to Europe in 1818. First to Paristhen to London in 1821, where it had made a sensation, especially in Masoniccircles (see Morris Bierbrier (ed.), Who Was Who in Egyptology, EgyptExploration Society, London, 1995, pp. 23 – 4). It is interesting to note,therefore, that Champollion, in March 1829, gave a party inside the Temple ofSethi I in honour of the birthday of his daughter, Zoraide, and also to the‘late Belzoni’ (who died in 1825) whom Champollion apparently much admired (SeeLacouture, op. cit., p. 661).106 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1525] Lacouture, op. cit., pp.636 & 668.107 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1526] Ibid., pp. 613 & 618.108 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1527] Ibid., p. 731.109 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1528] Ibid., p. 734110 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1529] Ibid., p. 742.111 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1530] Five of the founders ofthe Third Republic were Freemasons, including their leader Léon Gambetta (seeFaucher, op. cit., pp. 9 & 85.)112 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1531] Faucher, op. cit., p. 8;François Mitterrand is often confused with Jacques Mitterrand who was a GrandMaster of Grand Orient de France in the 1960s (see Ibid., pp. 169 – 70)."},{"pageContent":"113 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1532] Ibid., p. 275.114 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1533] Reported by BBC News,Africa, 22 December 2000, 16:01 GMT; see alsowww.ParisMatch.com/news/mit2812/s4page03_self.stm[http://www.ParisMatch.com/news/mit2812/s4page03_self.stm].115 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1534] The New Louvre,Publications Connaissance des Arts, Paris, 1989, p. 36.116 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1535] La Grande Arche,Publications Beaux Arts, Paris, 1990, p. 3.117 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1536] The New Louvre, p. 38.118 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1537] Ibid., p. 36.119 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1538] Ibid.120 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1539] Ibid., p. 38.121 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1540] Sunday Express, 3 Feb.1994, section 3, p. 7.122 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1541] Ibid.123 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1542] The New Louvre, p. 44.124 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1543] Kerisel, op. cit., p.157.125 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1544] Ibid., p. 177.126 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1545] La Grande Arche, p. 6.127 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1546] Ibid., p. 19.128 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1547] Ibid., p. 22.129 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1548] Ibid., p. 31.130 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1549] Ibid., p. 19.131 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1550] Ibid., p. 11.132 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1551] Jean Nouvel was born in1945 at Fumel, a village in the southwest of France. He worked with anarchitectural firm while attending school. In 1975, he opened his own office andparticipated in several competitions. Since he opened his office, Nouvel hasworked to create a stylistic language separate from that of modernism andpost-modernism. Rejecting the strict obedience to Le Corbusier that had stifledmuch of modern architecture, Nouvel initiates each project with his mind clearedof any preconceived ideas. Although he may borrow from traditional forms, hecreates a building that stretches beyond traditional constraints. Nouvel placesenormous importance on designing a building harmonious with its site andsurroundings. Although Nouvel relies on context to generate his designs, acertain continuum occurs from one design to the next. Within nearly all of hisdesigns, Nouvel consistently presents an interplay of transparency, shadow, andlight. In 1981 Jean Nouvel won the competition for a series of ‘great projects’requested by François Mitterrand, the French president. In 1987 he was awardedthe ‘Grand Prix d’Architecture’ for his whole body of work and the ‘Equerred’Argent’ for his design work on minimalist pieces of furniture. Some of hiswell-known projects are: The Arab World Institute (Paris, 1987) and the Monolith(Morat, Switzerland, 2002).133 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1552] See The Guardian, 21 May2001: ‘There are some buildings that deserve to have been built but never were.Jean Nouvel's Tour Sans Fin is one of them.

P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1896):In 1730, Samuel Pritchard, member of a constituted lodge in England, published atreatise entitled ‘Masonry Dissected’; and made oath before the Lord Mayor ofLondon that it was a true copy. Samuel Pritchard maketh oath that the copyhereunto annexed is a true and genuine copy of every particular. In his work hehas given the catechism or examination, in question and answer, of theApprentices, the Fellow Craft, and the Master Mason. There was no difficulty indoing this, as it is mere form. In his introduction he says, ‘the originalinstitution of Masonry consisted in the foundation of the liberal arts andsciences, but more especially in geometry, for at the building of the Tower ofBabel, the art and mystery of Masonry was first introduced, and from thencehanded down by Euclid, a worthy and excellent mathematician of the Egyptians;and he communicated it to Hiram, the Master Mason concerned in buildingSolomon's Temple in Jerusalem.’135 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1554] See New York Observer,April 13, 2003.136 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1555] Bauval, Secret Chamber,updated prologue and epilogue.137 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1556] Dossiers Histoire etArchéologie, vol. 101, January 1986138 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1557] Gérard Bauer, TableauxChoisis: Paris, page 41139 [30_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en1558] Lacouture, op. cit.,Epilogue: ‘L’absent Obélisque’ by Jean Vidal, p. 731.CHAPTER NINETEEN: THE CORNERSTONE1 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1559] Ovason, op. cit., p. 76.2 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1560] Ibid.3 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1561] See E.

Thestar Sirius was, on that day, rising at dawn cosmically with the Sun which, atthat time, was in Leo. In ancient Egypt the symbolism was clear: the goddessIsis brought the regenerative waters of the Nile's flood at about this time ofyear. It would seem unlikely that the organisers of this ceremony in Paris wereunaware of this connection. As we have already noted elsewhere, the ‘propaganda’artist Louis-David had taught symbolism to Picot who, in 1827, painted the Isison the lion throne in the Louvre.6 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1564] Bullock, op. cit., p. 137.7 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1565] Pick & Knight, op. cit., p.275.8 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1566] William Adrian Brown,History of the George Washington Masonic Memorial, History House, Alexandria,VA, 1980, pp. 8 – 9.9 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1567] Ibid., p. 56.10 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1568] Ibid., p. 9.11 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1569] Bernard Weisberger, TheStatue of Liberty: The First One Hundred Years, Horizon Book Promotions, NewYork, 1988, p. 30; see also James Lloyd, Beyond Babylon: The Last Week of theWorld, Christian Media, Jacksonville, OR, 1995, p. 103.12 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1570] Galtier, op. cit., p. 19.13 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1571] Galtier, op. cit., p. 150.14 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1572] Kerisel, op. cit., p. 176.15 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1573] Ibid., p. 138.16 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1574] Eric Foner & John A.Garraty (eds.), The Reader's Companion to American History, Houghton Mifflin,New York, 1991.17 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1575] Mathieu, op. cit., p. 14.18 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1576] Naudon, op. cit., p. 170.19 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1577] Ibid., p. 167.20 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1578] Naudon, op. cit., p. 171.21 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1579] Chevallier, op. cit., vol.II, p. 487.22 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1580] Garibaldi took over fromSalvatore Zola, an Italian living in Egypt who was a relative of the famousFrench novelist Émile Zola.

But in spiteof this, Ovason's detailed and meticulous research into the documentation andrecords of the event surrounding the design and building of Washington, DC isexcellent, and was most useful to us in the writing of this book.135 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1693] Ovason, op. cit., p. 118.136 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1694] The only surviving recordof this very important Masonic ceremony is in a short unanimous letter printedin one of the Charleston newspapers when the Georgetown Lodge No. 9 of Marylandgathered on the site for the cornerstone ceremony on Saturday, 13 October 1792.The cornerstone was laid on the southwest corner of the president's house (laterto be called the White House, by virtue of it being painted white after beingscorched by fire in 1814 by the British artillery guns).137 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1695] According to Ovason'sobservation of the setting sun on 12 August along Pennsylvania avenue, the axiswould have to be between 20 – 22°, depending on the height of the observer.Ovason recognised this in his notes (see Ovason, op. cit., p. 456, note 69).This fact was verified for us on 11 – 12 August 2003 by David Hudgins, Ph.D.,CFM, University of Oklahoma, who took a digital photograph of the event.138 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1696] This happens almost everyday of the year, except for about 2 ½ months when this star is not visible atnight. David Ovanson thinks that the alignment from the White House to theCapitol (i.e. along Pennsylvania Avenue) was deliberately designed to point atthe setting sun (Ovanson, op. cit., p. 337). Considering that Ovason makes astrong case that the five-pointed ‘Egyptian’ star symbol of Sirius wasintegrated into the fabric of the Declaration of Independence and the‘cornerstone ceremony’ of the Washington Monument (the Egyptian-style obelisk),it is curious, to say the least, that he did not realise the significance of thestellar alignment to Sirius of the White House-US Capitol axis along PensylvaniaAvenue.139 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1697] Ovason, op. cit., p. 337.140 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1698] Ibid., p. 456, note 69.Not knowing, however, from what vantage height Ellicott and L’Enfant made theirobservations, Ovason decided to establish his solar alignment by directobservations from 6 – 12 August.141 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1699] Ovason, op. cit., pp. 47& 58.142 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1700] Ibid., p. 127.143 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1701] Ibid.144 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1702] Tompkins, The Magic ofObelisks, p. 322 – 9.145 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1703] Ovason, op. cit., p. 129.146 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1704] Quote in Ibid., p. 87from Lalande, op. cit., vol. 1., p. 245.147 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1705] According to StarryNightPro 4, this event took place at about 4 p.m.148 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1706] Ovason, op. cit., p. 137.149 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1707] Naudon, op. cit., p. 79.150 [31_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en1708] The Pentagon wasconceived at the request of Brigadier-General Brehon B.

In the MiddleEast, however, many Arab and Muslim regimes and leaders have claimed them asbeing real. The Protocols were endorsed from Presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser andAnwar Sadat of Egypt, to King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and Colonel Gaddafi ofLibya. Recently political and intellectual leaders in the Arab world who endorsethe Protocols, and are supported by influential personages such as the GrandMufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ekrima Said Sabri, and organizations such as Hamas,as well as the Ministry of Education of Saudi Arabia.12 [33_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c21_r1.html#Ref-en1728] The history of theconcepts found in the Protocols was traced back to the works of Herrmann OttomarFriedrich Goedsche (aka Sir John Retcliffe) and Jacques Cretinéau-Joly by LucienWolf, and English journalist who published his findings in London in August1921.

Arthur James Balfour (1848 – 1930) was theBritish Statesman who maintained a position of great power within theConservative Party for 50 years. He was prime minister from 1902 to 1905 andforeign secretary from 1916 to 1919. Many Masonic researchers believe that LordBalfour was a Freemason, but United Grand Lodge denies this. At any rate, Afterbeing prompted by Zionist leaders Chaim Weizmann and Nahum Sokolow, Balfourwrote to Baron Rothchild, leading finacier in England and head of the Zionistmovement in UK. His famous letter from the Foreign Office is typed on plainpaper:Dear Lord Rothchild,I have much pleasure in conveying to you. on behalf of his Majesty's Government,the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which hasbeen submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet.His Majesty's Government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of anational home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endevours tofacilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood thatnothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights ofexisting non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political statusenjoyed by Jews in any other country.I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of theZionist Federation.Yours, Arthur James Balfour17 [33_grah_9781934708750_oeb_c21_r1.html#Ref-en1733] The Knights Templar is thefinal order joined in the York Rite. It does not deal with the Hiram Abifflegend. Unlike all other Masonic orders which accept members regarless of theirfaith, membership in the Knights Templar is open only to Freemasons who areChristians. This body is modeled off of the historical Knights Templar to carrythe ‘spirit of their organization’. It has been claimed that Freemasonry wasfounded by the Knights Templar or that the Knights Templar, after theirpersecution in 1312 – 4, took refuge in Freemasonry. The Grand Encampment of theUnited States, which regulates Masonic-Templars, acknowledges these theories butsays there is no evidence to justify them. A local Knights Templar division iscalled a ‘commandery’ and is governed at state level by a Grand Commandery aswell as the Grand Encampment of the United States.

At the First Zionist Congress in Baselin 1897, which was masterminded by Herzl, he founded the World ZionistOrganization. He died before seeing his vision of a Jewish state in Palestinebecome a reality. In 1949 his remains were brought to Jerusalem and buried in‘Mound Herzl’ cemetery. Many Israeli leaders such a Golda Meir and Levi Eshkolare also buried in this cemetery. Herzl's family seemed to have been plagued byterrible tragedies: Herzl wife Julia suffered from mental instability; hiseldest daughter, Pauline. was a heroine addict and died at the age of 40 from anoverdose in a French hospital.

Hiram was,and still is, a popular Masonic name (from Hiram Abiff, the legendary‘architect’ of Solomon's Temple in Masonic rituals). This choice of name wasclearly intended as a Masonic label, since Ulysses’ father, Jesse Brant, hadbeen Master Mason of a prominent lodge in Ohio.4 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1768] Although there iscontroversy whether General William T. Sherman was a Freemason, his own father,Charles Robert Sherman, certainly was a senior Freemason, as confirmed by hisMasonic apron located by the Ohio Historical Society. It is widely believed thatGen. Sherman spared prisoners who wore Masonic rings during the Civil War. Thebringing of the Egyptian obelisk to New York's Central Park in 1880 was clearlya Masonic event. It is also interesting to note that it was Gen. Sherman whoselected the site of Bedloe's Island (now Liberty Island) for the placing of theStatue Of Liberty in 1884, the latter clearly another Masonic event. William H.Herbert, the chief editor of the New York World newspaper, is often given creditfor being the first to suggest to Khedive Isma'il that the obelisk should bedonated to the United States. He got the financial backing from a prominentFreemason, William H. Vanderbilt who, in turn got the political support from ofRep. Henry G. Stebbins, New York's commissioner of public parks. It was Stebbinswho petitioned the US Secretary of State, William M. Evarts, to personally writeto Elbert Farman, the American consul-general in Egypt, to persuade the Khediveof Egypt to donate the obelisk to the US. Let us note in passing that William M.Evarts was also chairman of the Committee for the Statue of Liberty in 1883 – 4and it was he who sent a formal invitation to the Grand Masonic Lodge of NewYork to organize a ceremony “appropriate for the Occasion.” See Willam C.Kiesel's article in the September 1983 issue of The Masonic Philalesist; also J.E. Bebrens's article in October 1983 issue of Knight Templar magazine.5 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1769] On his way to theMediterranean during a 2-year survey with the Gettysburg, Gorringe and a fellowFreemason, Lieutenant Seaton Schoeder, used equipment to measure depth and with‘snagged the top of a submerged mountain in the Atlantic Ocean which theyclaimed was the ‘Lost Atlantis’, and received a congratulatory telegram fromPresident Grant for this ‘discovery’ (See D’Alton, op. cit., p. 10).6 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1770] The important symbolicaspect of an obelisk is not its tall stem but its top which is shaped like asmall pyramid, which feature very prominently in Masonic rituals.7 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1771] Seewww.robertbauval.co.uk/articles/articles/hawass1.html[http://www.robertbauval.co.uk/articles/articles/hawass1.html].8 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1772] Ibid.9 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1773] Ibid.10 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1774] Ibid.11 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1775] See Bauval, SecretChamber, Chapter 8.12 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1776] Interview with Rosal-Yusuf, ‘Israel is Robbing the Pyramids as it Robbed Palestine’, 5 May 1997.13 [34_grah_9781934708750_oeb_ap1_r1.html#Ref-en1777] Ibid.
