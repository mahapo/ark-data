I'mgrateful to the universe for giving me the chance to live this life.But why am I here? Why are you here? Why are we all here on planet earth? Whyare we conscious? What are our lives for?In answer to such questions, I can't offer any facts. I can only give you myview, which is that this world is a theatre of experience and that consciousnessis fundamentally nonphysical and one of the driving forces of the universe likegravity or electricity. My guess is that consciousness has chosen to manifest inphysical form and perhaps has invested in a very long process of manifestationon the earth—a four-and-a-half-billion-year process using evolution.So . . . I'm not against evolution. Evolution is obvious. It's a fact. It'sthere. But the fact that it's there gets over-interpreted. It gets loaded downwith a lot of baggage that it shouldn't really be carrying. For example,materialist scientist Richard Dawkins, author of The Selfish Gene, goes so faras to claim that the existence of evolution proves that there's notranscendental meaning to life, that there's no such thing as spirit, thatconsciousness cannot survive physical death—and so on and so forth.What Dawkins doesn't consider is the possibility that “the spirit world” (forlack of a better phrase) has used evolution to manifest physical entities inwhich consciousness can emerge and express itself and learn lessons. What hedoesn't consider, in other words, is the possibility that consciousness comesfirst while physical realms and beings are manifestations or projections of thatprimordial consciousness—as above, so below, as many ancient wisdom traditionsstate.According to these traditions, the world is indeed a theatre of experience andwe find ourselves on its stage in order to learn lessons that can only be taughtin a physical realm. Moreover, we are enjoined to be aware that we have beengiven a precious opportunity to be born into this world of matter andconsequences as human beings (rather than as fruit flies, or slime molds, orcockroaches, or stones). After all, the whole biosphere is here to support us.Four billion years of evolution on earth have led us to a point where we canmake very fine distinctions between good and evil, darkness and light, love andfear—where we can make conscious choices that will impact us and others inprofound ways.This is why, in my view, modern technological society can only be described asdemonic. It appears to have been expressly engineered to switch people off tothe wider implications, and the wider mystery, of being alive. It bombards ourconsciousness with sterile, soulless messages of production and consumption, ofenvy and greed, that never get to the fundamentals of anything. It seeks toconvince us that we're just meat—just accidents of physics and chemistry—thatour only purpose is to produce and consume as much as possible, and that whenwe're dead, we're dead and that's the end.I don't believe those messages! I think we're part of a very long journey—andthat we may manifest in human form many times upon this earth. Reincarnationmakes perfect sense to me precisely because I don't see consciousness as a mere“epiphenomenon of brain activity,” as a man like Richard Dawkins must, but asthe true source of all created things.I am not alone in this intuition of the primacy of consciousness; indeed, it isshared by all the contributors to this volume and, I suspect, in various guises,by a great many others, all around the world, who have successfully resisted themental virus mind-programming of modern technological society. But how to takethat resistance further? How, if we are beings of consciousness, are we toattempt to penetrate the mystery of consciousness itself and perhaps evendiscover who or what we really are and why we're here?At the level of scientific research, I'm not sure how much further scope thereis for physical probing of the brain, whether directly through surgicalprocedures or dissection, or indirectly by means of CT scans, MRI scans, PETscans, intracranial electrophysiology, and so on and so forth. Yes, we cancompare healthy and diseased brains, and we can map brains and arrive at fairlydefinite conclusions about the functions of different brain areas, and we caneven digitally reconstruct neurons, but I suspect the real breakthroughs in ourunderstanding of consciousness are going to come from an entirely differentdirection.That direction, controversially, has to do with psychedelics—which, as many ofthe contributors to The Divine Spark argue, offer spectacular potential for theinvestigation of the “hard problem” of consciousness. After a hiatus of nearlyhalf a century, this potential is again beginning to be explored byscience—although as yet only in tentative and limited ways that focus ontherapeutic outcomes and that shun the use of psychedelics to explore the deepermysteries of consciousness. Indeed, even in the therapeutic arena, continuingdelays, sidetracking, and shortage of funds are still the norm and ariseentirely from the ideology of the mind-programming exercise called the “war ondrugs” that we have been subjected to by our governments since the 1970s andthat continues to undermine the most basic values of Western democracy.SOVEREIGNTY OVER CONSCIOUSNESSWhat, after all, is Western civilization all about? What are its greatestachievements and highest aspirations?It's my guess that most people's replies to these questions would touch—beforeall the other splendid achievements of science, literature, technology, and theeconomy—on the nurture and growth of freedom.Individual freedom.Including, but not limited to, freedom from the unruly power of monarchs,freedom from the unwarranted intrusions of the state and its agents into ourpersonal lives, freedom from the tyranny of the Church and its Inquisition,freedom from hunger and want, freedom from slavery and servitude, freedom ofconscience, freedom of religion, freedom of thought and speech, freedom ofassembly, freedom to elect our own leaders, and freedom of sexual orientation.The list of freedoms we enjoy today that were not enjoyed by our ancestors isindeed a long and impressive one. It is therefore exceedingly strange thatWestern civilization in the 21st century enjoys no real freedom ofconsciousness.There can be no more intimate and elemental part of the individual than his orher own consciousness. At the deepest level, our consciousness is what we are—tothe extent that if we are not sovereign over our own consciousness, then wecannot in any meaningful sense be sovereign over anything else either. So it hasto be highly significant that, far from encouraging freedom of consciousness,our societies in fact violently deny our right to sovereignty in this intenselypersonal area and have effectively outlawed all states of consciousness otherthan those on a very narrowly defined and officially approved list. The war ondrugs has thus unexpectedly succeeded in engineering a stark reversal of thetrue direction of Western history by empowering faceless bureaucraticauthorities to send armed agents to break into our homes, arrest us, throw usinto prison, and deprive us of our income and reputation simply because we wishto explore the sometimes radical, though always temporary, alterations in ourown consciousness that drugs facilitate.Other than being against arbitrary rules that the state has imposed on us,personal drug use by adults is not a crime in any true moral or ethical senseand usually takes place in the privacy of our own homes where it cannot possiblydo any harm to others. For some, it is a simple lifestyle choice. For others,particularly where the psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, and DMT areconcerned, it is a means to make contact with alternate realms and paralleldimensions, and perhaps even with the divine. For some, drugs are an aid tocreativity and focused mental effort. For others, they are a means to tune outfor a while from everyday cares and worries. But in all cases, it seems probablethat the drive to alter consciousness, from which all drug use stems, has deepgenetic roots.Other adult lifestyle choices with deep genetic roots also used to be violentlypersecuted by our societies.A notable example is homosexuality, once punishable by death or long periods ofimprisonment, which is now entirely legal between consenting adults—and fullyrecognized as being none of the state's business—in all Western cultures.(Although fourteen US states, at time of writing, retain “anti-sodomy” lawsbanning homosexuality, these statutes have rarely been enforced in recent years,and in 2003 the US Supreme Court invalidated those laws.) The legalization ofhomosexuality lifted a huge burden of human misery, secretiveness, paranoia, andgenuine fear from our societies, and at the same time, not a single one of thehomophobic lobby's fire-and-brim-stone predictions about the end of Westerncivilization came true.Likewise, it was not so long ago that natural seers, mediums, and healers whofelt the calling to become “witches” were burned at the stake for “crimes” thatwe now look back on as harmless eccentricities at worst.Perhaps it will be the same with drugs. Perhaps in a century or two, if we havenot destroyed human civilization by then, our descendants will look back withdisgust on the barbaric laws of our time that punished a minority so harshly(with loss of reputation, financial ruin, imprisonment, and worse) forresponsibly, quietly, and in the privacy of their own homes seeking alterationsin their own consciousness through the use of drugs. Perhaps we will even end uplooking back on the persecution of drug users with the same sense of shame andhorror that we now view the persecution of homosexuals, the burning of witches,and the imposition of slavery on others.Meanwhile, it's no accident that the war on drugs has been accompanied by anunprecedented expansion of governmental power into the previously inviolableinner sanctum of individual consciousness. On the contrary, it seems to me thatthe state's urge to power has all along been the real reason for this “war”—notan honest desire on the part of the authorities to rescue society and theindividual from the harms caused by drugs, but the thin end of a wedge intendedto legitimize increasing bureaucratic control and intervention in almost everyother area of our lives as well.This is the way freedom is hijacked—not all at once, out in the open, butstealthily, little by little, behind closed doors, and with our own agreement.How will we be able to resist when so many of us have already willingly handedover the keys of our own consciousness to the state and accepted without protestthat it is okay to be told what we may and may not do, what we may and may notexplore, even what we may and may not experience, with this most precious,sapient, unique, and individual part of ourselves?It may even be, by allowing the demonization and criminalization of alteredstates of consciousness to continue, that we are denying ourselves the nextvital step in our own evolution as a species.THE GREAT LEAP FORWARDDuring most of the first seven million years of human evolution, there is noevidence at all for the existence of symbolic abilities amongst our ancestors.No matter how intensively we examine what is known about the fossil record, orspeculate about what is not yet known about it, all that we see evidence forthroughout this period is a dull and stultifying copying and recopying ofessentially the same patterns of behaviour and essentially the same “kits” ofcrude stone tools, without change or innovation, for periods of hundreds ofthousands, even millions of years. When a change is introduced (in tool shape,for example), it then sets a new standard to be copied and recopied withoutinnovation for a further immense period until the next change is finallyadopted. In the process, glacially slow, we also see the gradual development ofhuman anatomy in the direction of the modern form: the brainpan enlarges, browridges reduce in size, and overall anatomy becomes more gracile.By 196,000 years ago, and on some accounts considerably earlier, humans hadachieved “full anatomical modernity.” This means that they were in every wayphysically indistinguishable from the people of today and, crucially, that theypossessed the same large, complex brains as we do. The most striking mystery,however, is that their behavior continued to lag behind their acquisition ofmodern neurology and appearance. They showed no sign of possessing a culture, orspiritual beliefs, or self-consciousness, or any interest in symbols. Indeed,there was nothing about them that we could instantly identify with “us.” Dr.Frank Brown, whose discovery of 196,000-year-old anatomically modern humanskeletons in Ethiopia was published in Nature on February 17, 2005, points outthat they are 35,000 years older than the previous “oldest” modern human remainsknown to archaeologists: “This is significant because the cultural aspects ofhumanity in most cases appear much later in the record . . . which would mean150,000 years of Homo sapiens without cultural stuff.”Brown's colleague, John Fleagle of Stony Brook University in New York State,also comments on the same problem: “There is a huge debate . . . regarding thefirst appearance of modern aspects of behaviour. . . . As modern human anatomyis documented at earlier and earlier sites, it becomes evident that there was agreat time gap between the appearance of the modern skeleton and ‘modernbehavior.’”For Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History, the problem posedby this gap—and what happened to our ancestors during it—is “the question ofquestions in palaeoanthropology.” His colleague Professor David Lewis-Williamsof the Rock Art Research Institute at South Africa's Witwatersrand Universitydescribes the same problem as “the greatest riddle of archaeology—how we becamehuman and in the process began to make art and to practice what we callreligion.”Contrasted with the endless, unimaginative cultural desert extending from 7million years ago down to just 40,000 years ago, the appearance of the firstgreat, fully representative symbolic art in caves and rock shelters between40,000 and 30,000 years ago represents a spectacular enigma. That art, moreover,was already perfect and fully formed from the moment that it began to becreated. What ushered it in? Why did it happen? And why was it accompanied byother significant changes in human behavior—including but not limited to betterand more sophisticated stone and bone tools, better hunting strategies, and thefirst evidence for spiritual beliefs? Correlation is all we can prove, butlooking at the overall suite of new behavior that appears at this time, it isdifficult to avoid the conclusion that whatever divine spark led our ancestorsto start creating art caused all the other changes as well.In other words, if we can explain the art, we can explain the origins of modernhumanity. It is therefore of the greatest interest that such a theory has beenproposed and does indeed completely explain the special characteristics of StoneAge art from as far afield as Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Australia, andmoreover, why identical characteristics are found in art produced by the shamansof surviving tribal cultures today. The theory was originally elaborated byLewis-Williams and is now supported by a majority of archaeologists andanthropologists. In brief, it proposes that the reason for the eeriesimilarities and universal themes linking all these different systems of art isthat in every case—both ancient and modern and wherever in the world they arefound—the shaman-artists responsible for them had previously experienced alteredstates of consciousness in which they had seen vivid hallucinations, and inevery case their endeavour in making the art was to memorialise on the walls ofrock shelters and caves the ephemeral images that they had seen in theirvisions. According to this neuropsychological theory, the different bodies ofart have so many similarities because we all share the same neurology, and thusshare many of the same experiences and visions in altered states ofconsciousness.There are lots of ways of inducing the necessary altered state. The Bushmen ofSouth Africa get there through night-long rhythmic dancing and drumming; theTukano Indians of the Amazon do it through consuming the psychedelic beverageAyahuasca, the “vine of souls.” In prehistoric Europe, it's most likely that therequisite altered states were reached through the consumption of Psilocybesemilanceata—the popular little brown magic mushroom that is still usedthroughout the world to induce hallucinations today. In Central America, theMaya and their predecessors used other Psilocybe species (P. mexicana and P.cubensis) to induce the same effects.TERRA INCOGNITAI took LSD once in my twenties, at the Windsor Free Festival in England in 1974,and had a fantastic, exciting, energizing twelve-hour trip in a parallelreality. When my normal, everyday consciousness returned—and it did so quiteabruptly, like a door slamming—I felt grateful for such a wonderful experiencebut so much in awe of its power that I doubted if I would ever want to embraceit again. Suppose things had gone the other way? Suppose instead of an excitingmedieval Otherworld through which I had been allowed to travel like aknight-errant, I had been ushered into some hell realm for twelve hours? Howwould I have handled that? Would I have handled it at all?It was not until I reached my fifties and began work on my book Supernatural:Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind that I decided to confront thepsychic challenges of major hallucinogens again. In order to research my subjectproperly, and to know what I was talking about when I spoke of altered states ofconsciousness, I drank Ayahuasca with shamans in the Amazon andself-experimented with DMT, psilocybin, and the African visionary drug known asIboga—“the plant that enables men to see the dead.”The extraordinary experiences I went through convinced me that DavidLewis-Williams is right and that visionary states of this sort, brought on bythe accidental discovery of plant psychedelics, did indeed provide theinspiration for ancient cave and rock art traditions all around the world.Lewis-Williams is also right to insist that it is to the proper examination ofsuch altered states of consciousness that we should turn if we wish to discoverthe source of the first spiritual ideas ever entertained by our ancestors.It was precisely at this point, however, that I began to part company withLewis-Williams and his theory. Whatever the cave artists saw in their trances,and no matter how devoutly they may have believed that what they were seeing wasreal, the South African professor is adamant that the entire inspiration for25,000 years of Upper Paleolithic cave paintings reduces to nothing more thanthe fevered illusions of disturbed brain chemistry—i.e., to hallucinations. Inhis scientific universe, there is simply no room, or need, for the supernatural,no space for any kind of otherworld, and no possibility that intelligentnonphysical entities could exist.I found I couldn't leave the matter there, with the inspiration for cave art andthe birth of religion neatly accounted for by disturbed brain chemistry, withthe earliest spiritual insights of mankind rendered down to mere epiphenomena ofstrictly biological processes, with the sublime thus efficiently reduced to theridiculous. To have established the role of hallucinations as the inspirationfor cave art is one thing—and David Lewis-Williams, in my opinion, hassuccessfully done that. But to understand what hallucinations really are, andwhat part they play in the overall spectrum of human experience and behaviour,is another thing altogether, and neither Lewis-Williams nor any other scientistcan yet claim to possess such knowledge, or to be anywhere near acquiring it.Gifted and experienced shamans the world over really do know more—much more—thanthey do. So if we were smart, we would listen to what the shamans have to sayabout the true character and complexity of reality instead of basking mindlesslyin the overweening one-dimensional arrogance of the Western technologicalmind-set.Because I had been shaken to the core by my experiences with Ayahuasca andIboga, I decided to take my investigation further and to explore theextraordinary possibility that science is unwilling even to consider and thatDavid Lewis-Williams dismisses out of hand. This is the possibility that theAmazonian and African psychedelics had obliged me to confront face-to-face—andthat shamans contend with on a daily basis—the possibility that the “spiritworld” and its inhabitants are real, that supernatural powers and nonphysicalbeings do exist, and that human consciousness may, under certain specialcircumstances, be liberated from the body and enabled to interact with andperhaps even learn from these “spirits.” In short, did our ancestors experiencetheir great evolutionary leap forward of the last 40,000 years not just becauseof the beneficial social and organisational by-products of shamanism but becausethey were literally helped, taught, prompted, and inspired by supernaturalagents? Could the “supernaturals” first depicted in the painted caves and rockshelters—and still accessible to us today in altered states of consciousness—bethe ancient teachers of mankind? Could it be they who first ushered us into thefull birthright of our humanity? And could it be that human evolution is notjust the “blind,” “meaningless,” “natural” process that Darwin identified, butsomething else, more purposive and intelligent, that we have barely even begunto understand?If so, then we demonise altered states of consciousness at our peril, and ratherthan sending our fellow humans to prison for seeking them out, we shouldencourage, reward, and support them as the true explorers and adventurers of ourtime. I have brought together this series of essays in The Divine Spark, writtenby researchers and activists in the field of consciousness whose work I respect,as a contribution to this exploration of terra incognita."},{"pageContent":"ON CONSCIOUSNESS"},{"pageContent":"TO INFINITY AND BEYOND: THE HOLOGRAPHIC NATURE OF MASSBY NASSIM HARAMEINEXPLORING REALITYHave you ever wondered about the structure of reality? Where did it come from?How did it get here? And how did it self-organize to result in my observing it?These are fundamental inquiries that most people have asked themselves at somepoint in life. They might have thought of these questions in many differentways, perhaps not exactly as stated above, but most people have wondered aboutthe source of existence, about a beginning and an end, or about an eternalcontinuous dynamic.From an early age, I have felt these questions are most worthy of investigation,and in a certain way, my earlier adventures in the various sports industriesbecame tools that I could use to investigate the reality I am in, my interactionwith it, and my capacity to modify it or at least push it to the extreme. And tothe extremes I pushed it: whether it was skiing, climbing, or deep-sea diving,my tendency was to see how far I could push the edge of the structure of realityby my intent and capacity to overcome physical limitations. It was a test ofmind over matter, and in every case I felt that a resonance field could beestablished with the structure of reality—what athletes typically call “thezone”—where, as best I can describe it, I felt a flow, a type of harmony withall the various dynamics I was encountering in these extreme situations.Whether it was the forces involved, such as gravitational in skiing, or thesensations of the material world feeding back information to my body and my bodyresponding to it—such as the fine edge of my ski slicing through an icy surface,or the sensations in the tips of my fingers conforming to sharp crystals while Iclimbed a thousand-foot rock face—these moments of high communion with naturetaught me that there must be a fundamental feedback relationship. Some kind of afeedback/feedforward in the structure of space-time that produced a sense ofcomplete integration within the wheelworks of nature that I was experiencing (inthe zone). In these moments of high awareness, it felt like I had reached aharmonious relationship with the self-organizing properties of the materialworld, which I could clearly observe everywhere in the natural environment wherehighly organized and complex systems can be found.Yet there was more. My early interest in exploring the more mystical side of ourexperience led me to investigate the internal world of meditation, a world thatis in complete reference to the event of consciousness, of a deep andfundamental self-discovery and exploration of the observer experiencing thisreality. Therefore, it was both an external exploration, in which I could pushthe boundary of my influence on the external world (what one could call thematerial world), as well as an exploration of how far I could push the boundaryof the internal world to identify the source of the observation. And to my greatsurprise, the two seemed to feedback on themselves. For instance, in thosestates of “the zone” during peak experiences in sporting events, nature seemedto be speaking to me beyond the receptor sites of my five senses to a deeper,more profound sense, as in a unity between my physicality and the physicality ofthe world around me. Similarly, in deep meditative states and moments ofrapture, a profound sense of unity with the material world around and inside ofme seemed to take place. The question then was: what are the mechanics of theapparent feedback between me, the observer, and the material world, and is therean information medium that makes the connection between the observed and theobserver? Such discovery would generate a unified view of natural processes andthe physics of our world.In order to answer these questions appropriately, I had to conduct, on the onehand, an in-depth study of the physics of our world and, on the other hand, astudy of the mores (the customs and ritual practices) of various societies thatcould reveal a deeper understanding of the relationship between the observer andthe material world. In my opinion, both were equally important, although thetask of studying both in parallel, which encompassed fields ranging from appliedphysics to cosmology and quantum mechanics as well as archaeology, psychology,and spirituality, seemed insurmountable. Therefore, it was with greatprocrastination and reluctance that I finally abandoned my professional careerin the sports industry to dedicate all of my time and energy to the studiesnecessary in order to begin answering some of these questions.This led to a prolonged, isolated period of my life, when I lived in a van withthe bare minimum necessary to survive, living the simplest life possible inorder to dedicate every second of my day (and most nights) to the study of thesevarious fields. Still, to this day, I consider those times as some of the mostwonderful, productive, and mystical times of my life. I was completely free—freeof telephones, appointments, and interactions with the outside world. I wascompletely free to think whatever I wanted to think, to study whatever I wantedto study, and to move wherever I wanted to move, as all I had to do was put thekey into the ignition, press on the gas pedal, and I was instantaneouslyrelocating. My home was wherever I parked, and I was fortunate enough to be insome of the most beautiful and remarkable natural environments on our planet.From the alpine meadows of British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, to the highdeserts of the American Southwest and everything in between, I spent many monthsin communion with the natural world while in deep contemplation of its physicsand of the relationship between these physical structures and my observations ofthem.I continued a routine of physical activities to balance the typical fifteen toeighteen hours a day I spent studying. At the time, most of my physical activityconsisted of rock climbing, as I would typically start my morning with a sunriseclimb after some time meditating, or I would get out of the van at sunset for alittle fresh air and a quick multipitch climb to get my blood flowing. Since Iwas usually alone, these climbs mostly consisted of free solos (no protectivegear).At the fine edge of these experiences, where any mistake would surely result inthe obvious outcome of a body falling through space being rudely arrested by theground, I could get into that zone where, however extreme the experience ofreality was, there was a complete sense of comfort, a sense of absolute trust,of harmony with all of nature at the same time as complete relaxation—and thatstuff was addictive. I was in love with nature, and it felt like nature was inlove with me.I distinctly remember moments when my cheek was glued to the face of sheer rockwalls, with the exposure of a few thousand feet unravelling below me, and I wasgazing at teeny crystals glistening in the rising Sun and thinking about themolecules and atoms and subatomic particles that make up those crystals. Wheredid they begin, and where did they end? After all, these crystals I was climbingwere part of a larger crystal, a large geode called the Earth, and the Earth waspart of a solar system, and the solar system was part of a galaxy, and thegalaxy was part of a cluster of galaxies, which was most likely part of asupercluster, and so on. Furthermore, every crystal was made out of millions andmillions of molecules, and each molecule was made out of atoms, and these atomswere made out of subatomic particles, and so on. Was it appropriate to thinkthat the Universe ended somewhere, whether on the infinitely large scale or onthe infinitely small scale?These moments often brought on trance-like states in which I would completelylose track of my whereabouts and either dive down the rabbit hole into themolecular structure of these crystals or expand into galactic and universalstructures, imagining and contemplating!A MATTER OF SCALEFrom the study of the physics I was conducting and from various discoveries Ihad made in exploring my internal experience, I realized that if we were trulyto look for a complete picture of the dynamics and mechanics that produce boththe material world and the observer that experiences it, the model would have tobe based on an infinite relationship of scales.I discovered within myself what seemed to be an infinite division of the scales.This seemed to be beyond the concept of a bubble Universe from which everythingstarted with a bang without any clear understanding of either what produced thebang or how the material/energy got there to bang in the first place.I remember being very young, probably about seven, when it was explained to methat the Universe was like a big balloon expanding. My first question to myselfwas: expanding in what? Surely, if the Universe were expanding, it must beexpanding inside another Universe, larger than the one we are in. And thenagain, if that one were expanding as well, surely it must be expanding in alarger one, and so on. There was no easy solution to the riddle. The only thingthat made sense was that the Universe was infinitely large and infinitely small,that we lived in a continuum of divisions, and that our world was defined by themere fact that we observed the Universe from a very specific scale. Therefore,from this scale (that is, the scale of our Universe) there would be afundamental lower size that defined the pixel of our scale. Not that this pixelwould be the smallest thing the Universe does but that this pixel size is thefundamental building block for a universe of our specific magnitude.For instance, if you were experiencing the Universe from the scale of an atom oreven a subatomic particle, your experience would be widely different from theexperience you have of your Universe as a human being. And if I were to grow youfrom an atom to the size of a human, you would most likely think that you hadchanged universes or even changed dimensions (although that would be partiallytrue, as you have literally changed in dimension).These thoughts had come to me in various ways throughout the years, but howcould they be appropriately expressed in physics? Were there any physics alreadywritten in our world that indicated such a principle? Furthermore, did theseconcepts agree with thousands and thousands of years of advanced thinking inphilosophy, mysticism, and religious belief?The first clue had come in my teenage years, when I initially realized that foralmost a hundred years, a chasm had existed in physics between the mathematicsand models we use for large objects, which predicts a continuum that tendstoward singularity and infinities (Einstein's field equations), and the quantumworld of atomic and subatomic particles, which predicts linear functions ofbounded states, well-defined and with finite behaviors. Yet big things are madeout of small things, so how could the Universe use two completely different setsof physics?How could the Universe be both finite and infinite at the same time? Truly,day-to-day experience seems to point to the existence of well-defined finiteboundaries. After all, your body's dimensions are defined by what appears to bea very specific scale. The same applies to the chair you're sitting on, or thepole you're holding on to while you're reading this article on the bus on yourway to work. But wouldn't an infinite universe have no definition, no distinctway of identifying a boundary to define all other ones? All of this became thesubject of many years of contemplation, and the answer, interestingly, came froman unexpected source.THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE OF NATUREFrom my study of ancient civilizations, there seemed to be a persistent,recurring theme, and that theme, to cut to the chase, seemed to have somethingto do with geometry and some fundamental medium permeating everything, beingomnipresent, omniscient, and the organizing principle of nature. I looked tofind if similar concepts were present in our history of physics and the advancedphysics of today, and indeed I found similarities.On the geometric side, for instance, was Einstein's geometrization of thestructure of space-time. As well, in mathematics, fractal theory resembled manyancient concepts and symbols and provided a perfect relationship betweeninfinities and the boundary condition, as an infinite amount of boundaries couldbe embedded within a finite initial boundary (the scale at which you areobserving). As far as an omnipresent permeating energy was concerned, itoccurred to me then that maybe, just maybe, the all-prevailing intenselyenergetic vacuum of the quantum world might fit the bill.Maybe the space between all of the molecules and atoms that I was observing onmy cliff face inside the crystal that my hands were so firmly gripping, thespace between our planet and the Sun, the space inside our galaxy and the spacebetween galaxies was full instead of empty. Maybe space was permeated with allthe information of all things in the space and was the great connector betweenall these things. After all, from infinitely large to infinitely small, space isalways present, since even the extremely small radius of an atom still containssome 99.99999 percent space. Perhaps space defined matter, rather than thematerial world defining the space.What if matter were only the result of a discrete boundary condition of thespace itself, like the feedback iterations that produced the divisions of afractal? Was the world-space experiencing itself? Were we an extreme extensionof the space, looking back at ourselves and experiencing matter? Einstein seemedto think so, as in his famous statement: “Physical objects are not in space, butthese objects are spatially extended. In this way the concept ‘empty space’loses its meaning.”But if space were the great medium that connected all things, gatheringinformation from all places so as to self-organize and create the complexity weobserved in our natural world, then space would have to be nearly infinitelydense—infinitely dense with information or energy. Was this possible, and if so,was there any evidence as such? I was probing deeper and deeper into the physicsthat had been written and into the experiments that had been performedthroughout nearly three hundred years of modern physical theory, and I cameacross something significant.THE ENERGY DENSITY OF THE VACUUMIt seemed that in the quantum world, a difficulty had been encountered whenphysicists tried to calculate the energy density of an oscillator such as anatom. It turned out that some of the vibrations still existed even when thesystem was brought to absolute zero, where you would think that all the energywould be gone. In fact, the equations showed that there was an infinite amountof possible energy fluctuation even within the vacuum.To understand this better, physicists applied a principle of “renormalization,”using a fundamental constant to cut off the number and get a finite idea of howdense the vacuum energy must be with all its vibrations. The cut-off value usedwas the Planck's distance or length, named after the great physicist Max Planck,who is considered to be the founder of quantum theory. This value is thought tobe the smallest vibration of the electromagnetic field possible, being in theorder of 10-33 centimeters and having a mass energy in the order of 10-5 grams.To better understand the scales involved, here is an analogy. There areapproximately 100 trillion cells in the average human body, and each typicalcell is made of approximately 100 trillion atoms. If you were to take one ofthose minute atoms and make it the size of the dome at the Vatican (138 feet or42 meters diameter) the proton in the middle nucleus would be approximately thesize of a tiny head of a pin. Now, if we were to put a Planck unit on the end ofyour finger and then grow it to the average size of a grain of sand, then theminuscule proton would all of a sudden have a diameter equal to the distancefrom here to the nearest star, Alpha Centauri or approximately 25.5 trillionmiles or 40 trillion kilometers in diameter. Therefore, although the proton isalready an extremely small entity, the Planck size is mind-bogglingly tiny.Thus, the calculations that were done to derive the Planck vacuum energy densityentailed working out how many teeny Planck's volume vibrations could coexist ina cubic centimeter of space. The answer is then the number of Plancks that fitin a centimeter cubed of space multiplied by each of their mass (10-5 grams) toobtain the mass/energy density that existed in a centimeter cubed of space. Ofcourse, the result was enormous since the Planck is so tiny! The vacuum energydensity, or what is typically called the Planck density, was, when it was firstcalculated, in the order of 1093 grams per cubic centimeter of space and wasquickly dubbed at the time “the worst theoretical prediction in the history ofphysics”1 [06_chapter01.html#c01-aft1] or “the vacuum catastrophe.”To give you an idea of how dense this value is, if you were to take all of thematter we observed in our Universe today with billions of galaxies containingbillions of stars, most of which are much larger than our Sun, and we were tostuff them all into a centimeter cube of space, the density of that cube wouldonly be 1055 grams/cm3. This is still some thirty-eight orders of magnitude lessdense than the density of the vacuum. Many scientists thought that this figurewas ridiculous, and in general, it fell into obscurity. Even today, some trainedphysicists are not necessarily aware of this value. Throughout the years, I'vereceived prompt criticism from certain physicists who either were unaware of itsexistence or simply discarded it, as if the largest energy quantity everpredicted could be completely ignored.However, the vacuum fluctuations of energy are crucial to our understanding ofparticle physics at this point, as they are the source of virtual particlecreation at the atomic level, which is essential to our current understanding ofphysics. This is what led John Archibald Wheeler, a colleague of Einstein, toeventually state, “The vision of quantum gravity is a vision ofturbulence—turbulent space, turbulent time, turbulent spacetime . . . spacetimein small-enough regions should be not merely ‘bumpy,’ not merely erratic in itscurvature; it should fractionate into ever-changing, multiply connectedgeometries. For the very small and the very quick, wormholes should be as much apart of the landscape as those dancing virtual particles that give to theelectron its slightly altered energy and magnetism [Observed as the Lambshift].”2 [06_chapter01.html#c01-aft2]More importantly, in 1948 the Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir calculated andelaborated a configuration that would ultimately allow an experimentalvalidation of this vacuum energy. Casimir reasoned that if two plates wereplaced close enough to each other so that the longer wavelengths of the vacuumoscillations would be eliminated from between the plates and yet would still bepresent on the outside of the plates, then a minute density gradient could begenerated where there would be more pressure on the outside and less on theinside, resulting in the plates being pushed together. However, when thedistance by which the plates had to be separated to do the job was calculated,it was found that the plates had to be mere microns apart. This was animpossible task in 1948, and it wasn't until the early 1990s that thisexperimental test could be done successfully. The result agreed very well withthe calculations done by Casimir, showing that this energy of the structure ofspace itself is truly present.More recently, the Casimir effect has been able to be reproduced in a dynamicway called the dynamical Casimir effect, in which the plates are essentiallyreplaced by a nano-scale mirror oscillating at a significant percentage of thespeed of light. The result is that some of the pairs of virtual particles in thevacuum fluctuations cannot recombine quickly enough, as they usually do as theyare being separated by the movement of the mirror disturbing their path, andthus become “real” photons being emitted directly from the vacuum.3[06_chapter01.html#c01-aft3]Image [images/p20-01.jpg]A CONNECTED UNIVERSESo the energy was there in the vacuum at the quantum resolution. Could it be theenergy that connects all things, the energy from which everything emerges and towhich everything returns? Well, if so, it would have to be present at allscales. That is, there had to be evidence of this energy between stars andgalaxies as well. I had studied quite a bit of cosmology by then, and at thetime, there was zero evidence of this energy being present at the cosmologicallevel. Nevertheless, I was in a highly creative mode, elaborating on many of thefoundations that eventually brought me to form the various scientific papers Ihave written.From the sense I was getting from my studies of both ancient civilizations andadvanced physics, this vacuum energy could not be completely random. It had tohave structure, some kind of geometry, and most likely it was polarized—that is,spin was involved. And it was these thoughts that eventually brought me to add afundamental force to Einstein's field equations in order to show thatspace-time, in addition to curving to produce gravitation, twisted as well—likewater going down the drain—to produce the spin of all organized matter fromgalaxies to stars and even to subatomic particles. That twisting of space wouldimply that space itself was imbued with gyroscopic and Coriolis effects thatneeded to be included in Einstein's geometrization of space and time. Yet ifthis torque really was present, then we should be able to detect it at thecosmological level.I will always remember the day when this confirmation fell into my lap. It musthave been around the late 1990s, when I was in Joshua Tree National Park, whereI liked to spend part of the winter climbing and studying. Typically, I would goin and stay for weeks at a time before my supplies ran out and I would have tocome out again to get a little bit of shopping done. My budgets were quiterestricted (on average, three thousand dollars a year), so I would buy a veryminimal amount of food (I mostly lived on prana—vacuum energy), but almost everytime, I would buy popular science magazines to keep in touch with the latestscientific discoveries.So on a beautiful morning after one such expedition the night before and thenafter my ritual climb, I sat on the edge of the stairs of my van and opened whatI recall was an issue of Astronomy Magazine. And there it was: astronomers hadfound evidence that the Universe was not only expanding but was alsoaccelerating as it did so.This discovery produced a large amount of controversy at the time, and mosttheorists agreed that the best approach to deal with this anomaly was toreinstate a constant that was first used by Einstein. He had added this fudgefactor, called the cosmological constant, in his early mathematical expressionsto make the Universe static (which was believed to be the case at the time). Itwas later removed when astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe wasexpanding, as Einstein's equations would predict without the fudge factor. Nowastronomers reinstated the cosmological constant with a negative energy in sucha way as to show the Universe accelerating as it expanded. The fudge factor wasback. This eventually was dubbed “dark energy,” and it wasn't until recentlythat it started to be associated with vacuum energy. For me, however, that wasan easy and obvious leap, as I had already expected from my theoretical tenetsthat the polarized Coriolis dynamics of the vacuum structure would produce suchan effect on the universal expansion and rotation.So the vacuum energy was there at all scales, although in various densities—adensity gradient in the structure of space itself. Was the vacuum dividing atspecific densities from extremely large to extremely small? And if the vacuumenergy was essentially infinitely dense, and all scales contained vacuum—sinceeven the atom itself (as we saw earlier) contains a large percentage ofvacuum—then all atoms inevitably contained enough vacuum mass-energy to beconsidered a black hole. The Universe had to be black holes, from all the wayup—the Universe that we're in—to all the way down to every single atom. Withthis concept, I eventually coined the term black whole.A BLACK WHOLE UNIVERSEWhile pursuing various readings at the time and looking at the currentlyaccepted mass of our Universe, I realized that the Universe as a whole obeyedthe condition that described a black hole. Later on, with the help of Dr.Elizabeth Rauscher and afterwards Dr. Michael Hyson, we developed variousscaling graphs that supported the concept of a fractal black hole universe.Eventually, after some twenty years of being almost alone in thinking that wemay live in a black hole universe, popular science reports appeared thatelaborated on the research of a physicist at Indiana University. The firstsentence of the university's communiqué asks: “Could our universe be locatedwithin the interior of a wormhole which itself is part of a black hole that lieswithin a much larger universe?”4 [06_chapter01.html#c01-aft4]-5[06_chapter01.html#c01-aft5]But could an atom, or the nucleus of an atom, the proton, be considered a blackhole? I suspected so but I didn't know, and it was not until the year 2003 thatI finally got to working out the calculations to make such a prediction.At the time, I was living on the Big Island of Hawai'i and my daily routinestarted at sunrise with an encounter with the creatures of the ocean, usuallywild dolphins, spinner dolphins in particular. The sensation of gliding in theocean and the vorticular spinning hydrodynamics of the water around my bodyoften reminded me of our daily “swim” through the vacuum structure and theCoriolis dynamic that was part of my views of the physics of creation.It occurred to me that a certain percentage of the mass–energy of the vacuummust be contributing to the energetic event that we call the nucleus of an atom.Scribbling on a notepad in my office chair overlooking Kealakekua Bay, Icalculated the tiny volume of a proton and then proceeded to pack it with Planckvacuum fluctuations and outputted their combined mass. Remarkably, the combinedmass of all the Plancks inside the volume of a proton was equivalent to the massof the Universe, approximately 1055 grams! Was this evidence of the holographicnature of this vacuum information network connecting the information of allother protons in the Universe in one proton? Of course, this value was largeenough to make a single proton a black hole since this value even in the volumeof our Universe makes our Universe a black hole. I called Dr. Rauscher rightaway and discussed the simple calculations that would tell us how much of thevacuum energy was necessary for a proton to be in the Schwarzschild condition,the condition of a black hole. It took a remarkably small amount of the energyof the vacuum available in the proton to do the job, but what was notable wasthat the energy it took was equivalent to the energy necessary to produce theforce typically described as the strong nuclear force, or the strong force, theconfining force that holds the protons together in the nucleus of an atom. Thatis, if the proton was considered a teeny black hole due to the vacuum energypresent in it, then the attraction between two of these protons would be exactlythe force we attribute to the so-called strong force. Coincidence? I didn'tthink so.The strong force had always bothered me because, as in many other instances inmodern physics (such as with dark energy and dark matter), this force had beensimply invented, plucked out of thin air. When it was found that the protonswere highly charged but confined to a very small radius in the nucleus of anatom, physicists went on to invent a force that would overcome the repulsion ofthe electrostatic fields of these particles, and they made it exactly what itwas needed to be to do the job. Eventually it was believed that the protonseemed to have smaller constituents within it called quarks, which were confinedin an even smaller space, and so the color force had to be invented, which isthe base for quantum chromodynamics, or QCD. Furthermore, QCD predicts that itwould take an infinite amount of force to separate two quarks in order toaccount for the fact that no free quarks have ever been observed. Now theoriginal strong force near the radius of a proton was seen as only a remnant ofthis color force at the quark level.Yet from decades of calculations with supercomputers, no analytical solution hasever been found to support the QCD model, and the idea that quarks cannot befound because it would require an infinite amount of force to separate them iscircular at best. From my point of view, the infinitely strong nuclear colorforce was, instead, the result of the gravitational attraction of mini-blackholes, and it was extremely confirming to find that, when one considered theproton as a black hole, the gravitational attraction of such an entity wasexactly the energy typically associated with the strong force.Furthermore, although these calculations were very rough at the time, as we werescribbling on pieces of paper and napkins, it seemed that certain values of theSchwarzschild proton, as I came to call it, nicely predicted certain measuredvalues of the proton entity. This was, and still is, a radical idea—althoughmore and more physicists are coming to these conclusions now. Imagine all of theatoms that make up your physical body, and the entire material world around you,are made out of mini-black holes the size of a proton.Although these initial calculations were somewhat conclusive, it took until 2008before a first version of the calculation was published in one of our paperstitled “Scale Unification: A Universal Scaling Law for Organized Matter.” A morecomplete version titled “The Schwarzschild Proton” was eventually presented at ascientific conference in Belgium in 2009, where it won a Best Paper Award.Of course, the publication of that paper created many controversies in thescientific community and the public at large. Many argued that the mass of ablack hole proton, being some forty orders of magnitude larger than the measuredvalue in a laboratory, was not acceptable. Yet there were no qualms withthrowing a force into the standard model that has infinite strength in order forthe model to work, giving no explanation of the source of energy required toproduce such a force nor any mathematics or analytical solution to back it up.At least my solution was well-grounded in the analytical mechanics ofgravitation. Yet I certainly had to expand the understanding in order tocomplete the model and account for these forty orders of magnitude that werecontributed by the vacuum energy present within the volume of a proton. Whatwere the mechanisms that made this energy express itself as a gravitationalforce between two protons? And would this mechanism demonstrate that the rangeof such a gravitational field matches the short range typically associated withthe strong force?From 2009 to December of 2012, I worked continuously almost day and night in anattempt to uncover this mechanism. The Schwarzschild Proton approach had givenme some very important hints. The mass of all the vacuum fluctuations inside thevolume of a proton was equivalent to the mass of the Universe, or all otherprotons in the Universe. Maybe the holographic nature of the vacuumfluctuations' information network was the source of the mechanism that made theproton act as a mini-black hole. I started to think that maybe the vacuum energyinside the proton and the vacuum energy outside the proton relating informationthrough the surface event horizon of the proton may be the source of thispressure we call gravity.I set out to study holographic concepts and found that in the same period oftime, some of the most advanced physicists on the planet were attempting tosolve the black holes information paradox problem utilizing what eventually wasdubbed the Holographic Principle. The so-called information loss paradoxresulted from the consideration that all the information that falls into a blackhole would be lost as the black hole evaporates to nothing, due to an earlierpostulate by Hawking—known as Hawking radiation—which describes the emission ofquantum Planck vacuum fluctuations' “virtual particles” producing a slight lossof the black hole's energy over time, eventually leading to its completeevaporation.6 [06_chapter01.html#c01-aft6] But if the whole thing evaporates,where does the information go? The conservation of information or energy wouldbe violated. The Holographic Principle states that all of the information thatfalls into the volume of the black hole is imprinted in terms of little Planckbits on the surface of the black hole, and by using this approach, physicistsarrived at the correct answer for the temperature, or entropy, of the blackhole.7 [06_chapter01.html#c01-aft7]But what if the information that fell into the black hole was shared across allother black holes through the wormhole network of the vacuum fluctuations, likea huge information superhighway at the Planck and proton level? Maybe that'swhat allowed extremely complex systems to self-organize in such a rapidevolution since the early Earth, such as the biological structures all around us(including us) which cannot be accounted for under random functions in such ashort amount of time. Maybe the feedback between the network structures is thesource of the neuronal structure of our brain and the basis of what we think ofas self-awareness or consciousness. Furthermore, what if the information backand forth across the event horizon surface of the black hole, whethercosmological or a proton, is the source of its gravitational mass? Yet how wouldI define the mechanics of this information structure and extract from itmeaningful results? After all, the numbers involved with the vacuum fluctuationswere extremely large (the mass of the Universe) and it was tentative at bestthat such large numbers would yield precise values for objects like a proton forinstance, with a mass in the order of 1.6726 x 10-24 grams(0.0000000000000000000000016726gm), an extremely small number.After years of manipulations of algebraic relationships and geometricexplorations, finally a solution emerged. In fact, the solution was so simple,it had completely eluded me all these years. It turned out that a simplevolume-to-surface ratio of the Planck vacuum fluctuations (but only if they arePlanck spherical units, which I call PSU) generated the correct answer for thegravitational mass of any black hole in the cosmological Universe and that asimple inverse relationship yields the exact value of the mass of the proton.This was a remarkable result; all of a sudden I could give a solution toEinstein's gravitational equations by simply deriving the discrete Planckquantities of electromagnetic fluctuation of the vacuum interacting with thesurface of the black hole. Of course, this was a quantum gravity solution sinceit was quantized in discrete Planck units, and when I applied it to the quantumworld of the proton, although the numbers were extremely large, the resultingmass was within 0.001 x 10-24 grams of the measured value.Knowing that we are able to measure the mass of the proton extremely preciselybut that the measurement of the radius has been a source of great difficulties,I then reversed my equation to predict from the mass what the exact radius ofthe proton should be. In December of 2012, I sent a paper titled “QuantumGravity and the Holographic Mass” to the Library of Congress containing theseresults and my prediction. A few months later, on January 25, 2013, a newmost-precise-to-date measurement of the radius of the proton was made by theproton accelerator in Switzerland and published.8 [06_chapter01.html#c01-aft8]Incredibly, my predicted value was within 0.00036 x 10-13cm of the newmeasurement and inside one standard deviation, or loosely speaking, the marginof error of their experiment. Therefore, my predicted value from theoreticaltenets may be the most precise value and the experiments are slowly approachingit. This would make sense since I am making the calculations utilizing thesmallest unit of measurement possible, the Planck units, and the smaller theunits of measurement, the more precise the result.However, the paper did not predict just the radius of the proton and thatgravity can be described by discrete chunks of Planck quantities but as wellthat such a geometric approach of the pixilation of space-time with Planckspherical units yields as well, the correct value for the strong force and itscorrect range—demonstrating that the force that confines protons in the nucleusof atoms is actually gravity in terms of discrete Planck quantities of vacuumelectromagnetic fluctuations.REFLECTIONS ON A REVOLUTION IN PHYSICSWe live at a remarkable time. It is a time of great changes, includingfundamental changes in our understanding of the physics of our world and itsrelationship to consciousness. There is a quiet revolution occurring in physicsthat will modify our understanding of the atomic structure as many otherresearchers are now starting to realize that atoms may be considered asmini-black holes9 [06_chapter01.html#c01-aft9]-12 [06_chapter01.html#c01-aft12]and that the vacuum structure may be a crucial player in the existence of ourworld.Why is this exciting? Because if we understand the source of energy thatgenerates our Universe, its forces, and the mechanics under which the creationprocess occurs, then we can reproduce these dynamics with advanced technologicalmeans and completely transform our relationship to nature. Such discoveries willchange our world from a society that believes that there are only limitedamounts of resources and available land—and the wars fought over them—to asociety that realizes that there is an infinite amount of energy all around andwithin us, and a whole Universe to explore with the means literally to reach forthe stars.However, we don't need to wait for these advances to start to transformourselves and our environment. We need only take a few moments every day toconnect with the infinite potential present at the center of our entire materialworld, which makes up our existence, and experience its infinite nature andbeyond.NOTES1 [06_chapter01.html#c01-ft1].

We all know we have it, when we think, when we dream, when we savortastes and aromas, when we hear a great symphony, when we fall in love, and itis surely the most intimate, the most sapient, the most personal part ofourselves. Yet no one can really claim to have understood and explained itcompletely. There's no doubt it's associated with the brain in some way, but thenature of that association is far from clear. In particular, how do these threepounds of material stuff inside our skulls allow us to have experiences?Professor David Chalmers of the Australian National University has dubbed thisthe “hard problem” of consciousness, but many scientists, particularly those(still in the majority) who are philosophically inclined to believe that allphenomena can be reduced to material interactions, deny that any problem exists.To them, it seems self-evident that physical processes within the stuff of thebrain produce consciousness rather in the way that a generator produceselectricity—i.e., consciousness is an “epiphenomenon” of brain activity. Andthey see it as equally obvious that there cannot be such things as conscioussurvival of death or out-of-body experiences since both consciousness andexperience are confined to the brain and must die when the brain dies.Yet other scientists with equally impressive credentials are not so sure and areincreasingly willing to consider a very different analogy—namely that therelationship of consciousness to the brain may be less like the relationship ofthe generator to the electricity it produces and more like the relationship ofthe TV signal to the TV set. In that case, when the TV set is destroyed—dead—thesignal still continues. Nothing in the present state of knowledge ofneuroscience rules this revolutionary possibility out. True, if you damagecertain areas of the brain, certain areas of consciousness are compromised, butthis does not prove that those areas of the brain generate the relevant areas ofconsciousness. If you were to damage certain areas of your TV set, the picturewould deteriorate or vanish but the TV signal would remain intact.We are, in other words, confronted by at least as much mystery as fact aroundthe subject of consciousness, and this being the case, we should remember thatwhat seems obvious and self-evident to one generation may not seem at allobvious or self-evident to the next. For hundreds of years, it was obvious andself-evident to the greatest human minds that the Sun moved around the Earth—oneneed only look to the sky, they said, to see the truth of this proposition.Indeed, those who maintained the revolutionary view that the Earth moved aroundthe Sun faced the Inquisition and death by burning at the stake. Yet as itturned out, the revolutionaries were right and orthodoxy was terribly,ridiculously wrong.The same may well prove to be true with the mystery of consciousness. Yes, itdoes seem obvious and self-evident that the brain produces it (the generatoranalogy), but this is a deduction from incomplete data and categorically not yetan established and irrefutable fact. New discoveries may force materialistscience to rescind this theory in favor of something more like the TV analogy inwhich the brain comes to be understood as a transceiver rather than as agenerator of consciousness and in which consciousness is recognized asfundamentally “nonlocal” in nature—perhaps even as one of the basic drivingforces of the universe. At the very least, we should withhold judgment on this“hard problem” until more evidence is in and view with suspicion those who holddogmatic and ideological views about the nature of consciousness.It's at this point that the whole seemingly academic issue becomes intenselypolitical and current because modern technological society idealizes and ismonopolistically focused on only one state of consciousness—the alert,problem-solving state of consciousness that makes us efficient producers andconsumers of material goods and services. At the same time, our society seeks topolice and control a wide range of other “altered” states of consciousness onthe basis of the unproven proposition that consciousness is generated by thebrain.I refer here to the so-called “war on drugs” which is really better understoodas a war on consciousness and which maintains, supposedly in the interests ofsociety, that we as adults do not have the right or maturity to make sovereigndecisions about our own consciousness and about the states of consciousness wewish to explore and embrace. This extraordinary imposition on adult cognitiveliberty is justified by the idea that our brain activity, disturbed by drugs,will adversely impact our behavior toward others. Yet anyone who pauses to thinkseriously for even a moment must realize that we already have adequate laws thatgovern adverse behavior toward others and that the real purpose of the “war ondrugs” must therefore be to bear down on consciousness itself.Confirmation that this is so came from the last British Labour government. Itdeclared that its drug policy would be based on scientific evidence, yet in 2009it sacked Professor David Nutt, chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse ofDrugs, for stating the simple statistical fact that cannabis is less dangerous(in terms of measured “harms”) than tobacco and alcohol and that ecstasy is lessdangerous than horse riding. Clearly what was at play here were ideologicalissues of great importance to the powers that be. And this is an ideology thatsticks stubbornly in place regardless of changes in the complexion of thegovernment of the day. The present Conservative-Liberal coalition remains justas adamant in its enforcement of the so-called war on drugs as its Labourpredecessor and continues, in the name of this “war,” to pour public money—ourmoney—into large, armed, drug-enforcement bureaucracies which are entitled tobreak down our doors at dead of night, invade our homes, ruin our reputations,and put us behind bars.All of this, we have been persuaded, is in our own interests. Yet if we asadults are not free to make sovereign decisions—right or wrong—about our ownconsciousness, that most intimate, that most sapient, that most personal part ofourselves, then in what useful sense can we be said to be free at all? And howare we to begin to take real and meaningful responsibility for all the otheraspects of our lives when our governments seek to disenfranchise us from thismost fundamental of all human rights and responsibilities?In this connection, it is interesting to note that our society has no objectionto altering consciousness per se. On the contrary, many consciousness-alteringdrugs, such as Prozac, Seroxat, Ritalin, and alcohol are either massivelyoverprescribed or freely available today, and they make huge fortunes for theirmanufacturers but remain entirely legal despite causing obvious harms. Couldthis be because such legal drugs do not alter consciousness in ways thatthreaten the monopolistic dominance of the alert problem-solving state ofconsciousness, while a good number of illegal drugs, such as cannabis, LSD, DMT,and psilocybin, do?There is a revolution in the making here, and what is at stake transcends thecase for cognitive liberty as an essential and inalienable adult human right. Ifit turns out that the brain is not a generator but a transceiver ofconsciousness, then we must consider some little-known scientific research thatpoints to a seemingly outlandish possibility, namely that a particular categoryof illegal drugs, the hallucinogens such as LSD, DMT, and psilocybin, may alterthe receiver wavelength of the brain and allow us to gain contact withintelligent nonmaterial entities, “light beings,” “spirits,”“machine elves” (asTerence McKenna called them)—perhaps even the inhabitants of other dimensions.This possibility is regarded as plain fact by shamans in hunter-gatherersocieties who for thousands of years made use of visionary plants and fungi toenter and interact with what they construed as the “spirit world.” Intriguingly,it was also specifically envisaged by Dr. Rick Strassman, professor ofpsychiatry at the University of New Mexico, following his groundbreakingresearch with human volunteers and DMT carried out in the 1990s—a project thatproduced findings with shattering implications for our understanding of thenature of reality. For further information on Strassman's revolutionary work,see his book DMT: The Spirit Molecule."},{"pageContent":"WHY RICHARD DAWKINS IS THE BEST ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GODBY RUSSELL BRANDI'm glad I get the opportunity to prove the existence of God. You may think meunqualified for a task that has baffled the finest theologians, philosophers,and physicists since the dawn of time, but don't worry, I've been unqualifiedfor every job I've ever embarked on, from learning to drive to working as apostman for the Royal Mail, and both these quests were successfully completed,aside from a few broken wing mirrors and stolen letters. So, unlike theChristmas money of the residents of Ockendon, Essex, you're in good hands.Atheists are all around us, sermonizing from the godless pulpit on the benefitsof their anti-faith with some pretty good arguments like, oh I dunno,“evolution” and oddly, I think, given the stated nature of their motives, beingincredibly reductive in their line and manipulative in their targets.ZERO FUN AND TOO MUCH MENTALI once had the pleasure of talking to the brilliant Richard Dawkins, who hasbeen called the “Abu Hamza of atheism.” (It was me who called him it, justthen.) In his remarkable documentary The Genius of Charles Darwin, the professorexcellently relayed the information within his hero's On the Origin of Species,gave us some key information from his own masterpiece The Selfish Gene (which Ionly read because I took it to be an unsanctioned biography of the Kiss bassistGene Simmons) and set about unraveling religion and spirituality with theadorable fervor of the Andrex puppy making off with some scriptural lavvy paper.Choice among Dawkins's targets were the kind of daft apeths we're accustomed totolerating on our telly; low-browed creationists gurgling up Genesis like(forbidden) apple chutney and knee-jerk fundamentalists, who are always zero funand far too much mental.Who could fail to concur with Dawkins's erudite dismissal of these hapless saps?No one. I have Dawkins to thank for my own understanding of the fantasticdiscovery that is evolution; his passion and expertise in this documentaryhugely enhanced my knowledge and illuminated what for many spiritual people canbe a difficult subject.It is only in his absolute renunciation of God that the professor and I partcompany and, heaven knows, I'd understand if you wanted to join his party. Inalmost any expedition in which the rival guides were myself and Richard Dawkins,I wouldn't be surprised to find myself pulverized by the converted hordestampeding toward the professor.However, it's not just swivel-eyed haters and mad mullahs who live a religiouslife, and to condemn all religion and spirituality on the basis of theirslack-jawed, knee-jerk, saliva-flecked vitriol (spit-triol?) is as unfair as thesimplified dogma that the choir of pious atheists harmonizes against. Gandhi, asI recall, was quite a religious man.Saint Francis of Assisi was a straight-up believer. And while the tenets ofBuddhism are varied on the notion of God, the creator, I think it would be fairto describe the Dalai Lama as a spiritual chap. I don't see atheists queuing upto call the Dalai Lama a dickhead. These are the examples to which we shouldturn when questioning the existence of a power beyond man. Not Glenn Beck orsome other capillary blob on Fox News.Dawkins, the patron saint of atheists, would say that all religions are simplywrong—a baffled blanket of cozy lies to warm dopes into snug compliance,unproven ideologies based on faith. I think God exists beyond the current reachof science, that one day our fast-evolving minds will know God empirically asthey do now only intuitively. That the mystical will become physical.Galileo Galilei, the man credited with being the first to point a telescopeskyward (all previous users had presumably been Renaissance Peeping Toms),speculated that heliocentrism was viable: that the Earth likely circled the Sun.He was imprisoned for this observation, which, viewed retrospectively (throughmy invention, the retro-speculars), seems unfair. He was, after all, correct.Evidently the persecution of scientists by religion has irked the members ofthat community, but I think that the theoretical annihilation of God is areprisal too far.We must, on both sides of the debate, show compassion. I, for example, haveoverlooked the bald fact that Galileo's parents gave him a bloody stupid firstname considering their surname was Galilei. Galileo Galilei. He would have gonethrough hell at my school, not for being a heliocentric heretic but for being aridiculously titled child. We already had another lad in my year called DavidDave (honestly), so his problem wouldn't have even been original.Religion has rightly been cited as the cause of much suffering and conflict, waybeyond what ol' star-gazing “two names” went through with his prison stretch andforced retraction. Plus the Pope (I think it was Pope Benedict Benedicto)recently pardoned GG, so let it go.A CROISSANT CONFLICTIt has been said that “man is never more vehement in killing his brother thanwhen it is in God's name”; perhaps that's true, but we humans can seek outconflict in any situation. My last serious argument was about a croissant. Ithad been placed in the fridge beneath a meat product and could have beencontaminated by dripping. If I'd had a sword on me, I would have happily carriedout a jihad in the kitchen, and I'm a vegetarian. It is our nature to quarreland fight just as it is to inquire and to empathize.Frankly, I think atheism is a commodity we cannot currently afford. “No atheistson a sinking ship,” they say, and a quick glance out the porthole revealsicebergs aplenty, but I'm not suggesting God as some demented alternative todesperation—no, this is a phenomenon that touches my life every day.Through Transcendental Meditation, twice daily I feel the bliss of the divine.Through the mental repetition of a mantra, eventually my chattering monkey mindrecedes, gently banishing concerns of the past and drawing the inner eye awayfrom speculation and want. I connect to a boundless consciousness that has nopalpable relationship with my thoughts, fears, or desires.In this impersonal state of awareness, I recognize that consciousness existsbeyond time, beyond the individual. There was a time when the universe did notexist, this we know. We also know that energy cannot be created or destroyed,only transformed. This means that something, not nothing, existed before theuniverse. We do not know what, but there is wonder and intelligence enough tosuggest that design may have been a component.Could a witless miasma of molecules and dust ever have created anything asingenious and incredible as Richard Dawkins? I don't think so, but I'm preparedto listen and tolerate any theories and arguments, a concerto of contemplation,a requiem of speculation, to divert us till we know the truth."},{"pageContent":"STELLAR CONSCIOUSNESSBY GREGORY SAMSHave you ever wondered why your spirits are lifted on a sunny day and not in ahot bright room—or paused to consider that the energy of your life is itself therecycled light of the Sun? Have you spent more of your life thinking aboutsuntans, sunglasses, and sunblock than about the nature of the star in yourmovie—the movie of Life? As you read these words, the energy that moves youreyes and the energy with which you comprehend their meaning is the light of ourSun being expressed through a new medium: you. It's no wonder that we enjoybathing in Sun's light.Is there any reason why we cannot consider whether that which brings us thelight of life might be conscious of life itself? It was once a commonunderstanding. History's most enduring monuments were built with the Sun andother heavenly bodies in mind. As we explore the history of these cultures, wecan easily overlook the one underlying principle common to the Egyptians, Maya,Celts, and Greeks, not to mention the Sumerians, the Chaldeans, the Assyrians,the Gnostics, the Khmer, the Norse, the Inca, the Aztec, the natives of Southand North America, and countless other cultures through the world, includingtoday's Hindu, Zoroastrian, and Shinto religions. This is the recognition thatour local star is a conscious entity—a celestial being worthy of divine status.Yet despite being the world's most worshipped deity, the concept of a living Sunbecame one of the most powerful and unspoken taboos of the Western world and onewhich modern researchers of the above cultures are often reluctant to breach.Many scientists question the existence of consciousness itself. Since they haveno tools with which to weigh or measure it, and no formula to express it, theyfind no alternative but to deny its existence. They believe consciousness to bean illusion created by our brain to serve some evolutionary purpose, as yetundetermined. Some of this “Grand Illusion” camp have a corollary to theirbelief, which is that human beings have no free will—that every single thing wedo or think (every word, each wink or inadvertent stink) was somehowpredetermined by the arrangement of particles immediately after the Big Bang.For scientists who do acknowledge the existence of consciousness, it was assumeduntil recently that human beings were the only vessel that it could possiblyinhabit. Nothing else was deemed to be aware of its own existence, orfunctioning on anything other than the level of a biological machine solelydriven by the need to propagate its species. Some in this camp now argue thatorangutans and dolphins and a handful of other species, mainly primates, mightjust share this “rare” facility. But worms and trees rarely figure in theirconsideration, even though bacteria colonies are seen to act like a unifiedintelligence.Scientists who may disagree over whether or not consciousness is an illusionwill agree that it is the greatest mystery of our existence; this, even thoughit is consciousness that is seeking to understand itself. So how can we be surethat nothing else experiences this mysterious experience that we cannotunderstand? We cannot be sure; we simply perpetuate a well-entrenched Churchtradition. It was not science that made us look on Sun worship as primitive andignorant, but the Roman Church that took an extremely dim view of anybody whodisagreed. Scientific thought does not even entertain the idea of stellarconsciousness, dismissing it out of habit, not by the application of science.Were you to have told a Zoroastrian or Mayan Sun worshipper of the fusionreaction in the core of the Sun, describing the very different functions of thenext six layers, explaining the corona and the solar wind that spins from it,their jaw would have dropped in delighted awe. Our scientific understandingwould give them greater cause to revere the character bringing light and thepower of life to our world. The knowledge of anatomy does not diminish ourstatus as conscious living beings.However, unlike the ancients, we now view the Sun as little more than a dumbball of hot gas that happens to accidentally provide us with the light of life.But science has found out an awful lot about this hot ball of highly chargedplasma (it's not actually gas) and its stellar siblings. Unlike the ancients, weknow Sun and others stars turn simple hydrogen and helium into all the elementsthat make up us and the world around us—from carbon and oxygen, to iron andgold. They are the transmutation engines of the cosmos. By weight, 93 percent ofthe matter in your body was born in the body of a star.We know that stars turn matter itself into the energy of light, agent of theelectromagnetic force. Light informs us of the world around us and brings itenergy. Light is the catalyst in photosynthesis, on land and in the world'soceans, where water molecules and carbon dioxide from the air are rearrangedinto the basic building blocks of the entire vegetable world. During thisprocess, the energy of Sun's light is stored in plants and their seeds,transferring to us when we eat those basic foods or another animal that atethem. This is the energy that powers life and consciousness.We are made of stardust and powered by starlight. This much we know.Unlike the ancients, we know that stars are complex and interconnected balls ofplasma. Our Sun has seven distinct layers, all performing different functionswith some of them rotating around each other at different speeds. Its powerfulcorona, an invisible energy field, occupies more space than Sun itself and isthought to manage various solar features including sunspots, solar flares,coronal filaments, and coronal mass ejections. We identify and measureelectromagnetic field lines connecting the corona to Earth. In 2008 NASAdiscovered a magnetic portal the diameter of Earth that connects Sun's corona toour planet's geomagnetic field, through which tons of high-energy particles arebelieved to pass at eight-minute intervals in what is called a “flux transferevent.” We know that the solar wind spinning off Sun's corona twists into agiant electromagnetic bubble, the heliosphere, which embraces and protects thesolar system as it travels through the galaxy at an estimated 45,000 miles perhour. Scientists rank Sun's corona as its most mysterious feature. Perhaps it isas great a mystery as human consciousness. Perhaps it embodies the mind of Sun.Unlike the ancients, we know that all those stars in the night sky are relatedto our Sun. We see that most stars live as couples, called “binary systems” byastronomers, and that they are not scattered randomly but live in communitiescalled “stellar clusters.” Every star sends its own unique signature into spaceand may have undiscovered connections to other stars, like those recentlydiscovered connecting Earth to Sun. Electromagnetic fields have been discoveredspanning deep space, connecting galaxy to galaxy.Unlike us, the ancients felt connected to the heavens and believed that theconsciousness of the Sun and planets influenced our consciousness, and thus thecourse of our lives. They carefully constructed monuments designed to connectour human energies to those of the Sun and other celestial beings. Today we knowlittle of their knowledge and skills, of why and how they created the structuresthat survive to this day.The harnessing of light in its multiple wavelengths underpins nearly all ourtechnology of information transfer, from radio to TV, smartphones to wi-fi,optic cables to MRI scans. Within its narrow “visible” spectrum, light informsus and other animals of the world around us. Our cells and those of otherspecies use photons to communicate with each other, and we discover plantscommunicating with photons. It does not seem far-fetched to consider that whenstars are dispatching photons of many frequencies into the cosmos, they areserving the same purpose—the exchange of information.Perhaps if scientists abandoned that old religious taboo against consideringconsciousness in anything other than us or things like us, they would not needfixes like “dark matter” to explain why galaxies do not behave like accidentalmechanical systems. Essentially, “dark matter” is little more than the namegiven to the solution for a problem that has not yet been solved—it might aswell be called “Factor X.” Perhaps the reason galaxies don't fall apart isbecause they are not dumb balls of gas reacting to nothing more than the laws ofphysics, but are instead joined-up communities of intelligent dynamic beings.Just a thought.I do not claim that Sun's behavior proves it and other stars to be consciousbeings—simply that from an unbiased viewpoint and considering all the science,this looks like the most likely option. It is the default option humanity hadalways held until it was burned from our culture, literally, by a jealousChurch. Now, with the supporting data to hand, and burning at the stake out ofvogue, let us reconsider this idea with an open mind, free of irrational taboos.Acknowledgment of stellar consciousness changes everything, and I explore theinevitable implications of this within my book Sun of gOd. Perhaps the mostprofound of these recognizes the status of light itself, for which our Sun isthe local agent. And from a personal perspective, can there be anything moreimportant to our spiritual well-being than reestablishing a connection with thelife-giving star in the movie of Life?"},{"pageContent":"REFLECTIONS IN A REAR-VIEW MIRROR: SPECULATIONS ON NOVELTY THEORY AND THE ENDTIMESBY DENNIS J. MCKENNAJUNE 6, 2014When Graham recently invited me to contribute to his new anthology onconsciousness, The Divine Spark, I was pleased at the invitation but didn'treally know what to submit. Then I ran across two rather peculiar essays that Ihad written in the fall of 2011 while writing my memoir, The Brotherhood of theScreaming Abyss, which was published at the end of November in 2012. For variousreasons, I eliminated them from the final draft of the book and relegated themto the limbo of some backup hard drive.One, titled “This Just In . . . ,” is a speculation on Terence's Novelty Theorythat was prompted by an unusual announcement by a group of physicists at theLarge Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva. In September 2011, these researchersannounced that they had observed an extremely anomalous phenomenon, thedetection of neutrinos that travel faster than light, in clear violation ofEinstein's Special Theory of Relativity. This event, if proven to be true, wouldhave certainly been novel, or at least the measurement of it would have beennovel, so it seemed like an excellent opportunity to muse on the Time Wave (TWO)and Novelty Theory and the nature of Novelty itself. The Time Wave, or moreaccurately the basic tenets of its construction, was downloaded into Terence'sbemushroomed brain while we were in the grip of our shared psychedelic/shamanicodyssey at La Chorrera, Colombia, in April 1971.The second essay, titled “The Day the World Ended,” was written a few weeksafter the first, on October 28, 2011, which happened to be the date that someMayanist scholars had postulated was the real correct date for the end of theMayan calendar, not December 21, 2012. This essay provided a good opportunity toreflect on humanity's seeming mass obsession with the End Times and theassociated eschatological hysteria that infected the collective zeitgeist in theyears and months preceding the postulated end date of the Mayan Calendar,December 21, 2012. Now, nearly two years downstream from that much anticipatedand much dreaded event, we can look back on that date and wonder just what gotinto our collective heads. It was arguably the greatest non-event in humanhistory; viewed as a cultural phenomenon, it can tell us little about the natureof time, eschatology, or history, but it can tell us volumes about ourproblematic human nature, and our endless capacity for distraction and denial.THIS JUST IN . . .SEPTEMBER 24, 2011 1:43 PMOver the last few days as I have been working on this section, a research group1[10_chapter05.html#c05-aft1] at the CERN Large Hadron Collider facility inGeneva has reported that they have detected a population of neutrinos thatapparently travel faster than light. The group reported an “anomaly” inexperiments in which a beam of neutrinos sent 454 kilometers from Geneva toItaly arrived at the detector 60 nanoseconds faster than the speed of light.This is an infinitesimally small amount of time (a nanosecond is a billionth ofa second), but nevertheless, it can be measured accurately, so the researchersclaim. This announcement has rocked the world of physics, as well it should, andnow other groups of researchers are piling on to either find the errors in themeasurements (as well they should) or verify the results. This is the way thatscience is supposed to work. Extraordinary claims require extraordinaryevidence, and this is one of the most extraordinary claims to come out ofphysics in a good long while. So therefore, independent confirmation by otherresearch groups is the first step. Most likely, there is an error somewhere inthe measurements, the math, or some other factor (these experiments areextremely delicate) but the researchers claim to have repeated the experimentmultiple times and are standing by their results. If, however, the experiment isconfirmed, it's extremely big news, because it means nothing less than thecomplete collapse of Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity, and with it, muchof the foundation of modern physics.I decided to comment on this development in midstream, because time does notstop in the real world and interesting things are constantly happening. And muchof what has preoccupied Terence and me has been the nature of Novelty, and thatpreoccupation led to the Time Wave theory. The Time Wave that Terenceconceptualized (or channeled) at La Chorrera purports to be a mathematicalconstruct that describes the structure of time, a map of novelty and its“ingression” (to use Whitehead's term) into the continuum, that is, intoreality. I am actually one of the harsher critics when it comes to TW0, orNovelty Theory as it has come to be known. I do not believe it's a real theory,and there are gaps and loopholes in the conceptual foundations of Novelty Theorythat on close scrutiny are extremely hard to defend. However, much of the TW0“theory” is based on Alfred North Whitehead's metaphysics, which is much morecarefully reasoned. And based on Whitehead, I'm willing to grant that there issuch a thing as “Novelty” (which, loosely characterized, means that occasionallythere really is something new under the sun), and that, somehow or other,Novelty does “ingress” into reality. But some of the more animated discussionsthat Terence and I had about Novelty Theory were precisely about the questions:what is a truly novel event, and how does it “ingress” into the continuum, andhow do we recognize it when it does (or more specifically how does the Time Wavemap it or identify it)?Now we have been handed, in the lovely waning days of September 2011, a reportof an event that may be truly novel! We have been given the gift of a casestudy. We can watch novelty unfold in real time, so we can learn something(maybe) about just how novelty does express itself in reality and how thatreally plays out in our experience of reality. Much of the controversy over theTime Wave (and the subject of many an argument between Terence and me), had todo with the question of how one “fits” the wave to time, how to set the “enddate” which you have to do because the theory postulates that there is adefinite instant, a moment in time in which the wave collapses presumably at theinstant of the Ultimate Novel Event, whatever that might be. Some have referredto this moment as the Singularity, but this is a deliberately vague term andpossibly is misleading as well. The concept of the Singularity implies that atsome point we cross a threshold where all of our assumptions, about causality,time, space, and virtually everything else, no longer apply. The Singularitycould be just about anything, so the term is not particularly helpful inpredicting what it's likely to be.As anyone familiar with TW0 and Novelty Theory knows, Terence settled on theexact moment of the winter solstice on December 21, 2012, as the end point forthe Time Wave based on a number of criteria and assumptions that may or may notbe valid. This date corresponds to the generally accepted date for the end ofthe Mayan Calendar as well (though ever-industrious revisionists have recentlycome up with a much more alarming, because more imminent, date for the end ofthe Mayan Calendar of October 28, 2011.2 [10_chapter05.html#c05-aft2] Aboutthis, we shall see, it's just around the corner. But that's the subject ofanother conversation and probably another rant.).In his conception of Novelty Theory, Terence favored what might be called the“punctate” theory of Novelty. Novelty ingresses into the continuum as dramaticevents that have a global impact. Events like the detonation of the atomic bombover Hiroshima, or the assassination of JFK, or the crucifixion of Christ, orHurricane Katrina, or the terrorist attack of 9/11/2001 (though of course he didnot live to see the latter two). But his idea was that these kinds of events hadan enormous impact on history and the subsequent unfolding of human affairs, sothey were truly “novel” and thus could be used as markers when trying to fit theTime Wave to the major novel events of history (and on larger scales evengeological and evolutionary events, such as the impact of the Chicxulub asteroidin the so-called K-T extinction event that is thought to have spelled the end ofthe dinosaurs some 65 million years ago) and thereby arrive at an End Date forthe Time Wave.In contrast, I argued in favor of the “gradualist” theory of Novelty. Majorhistorical or geological events like these may appear to erupt into time, butit's an illusion; it ignores the necessary chain of cause and effect that leadsup to the dramatic event. Which is truly the novel event? When the bombdetonates over Hiroshima, or when it is first detonated in the desert atAlamagordo? Or when the first sustained fission reaction is triggered in theField House at the University of Chicago by Oppenheimer's group? Or whenEinstein first conceives his Theory of Relativity and comes up with the famousequation E=MC2, which provided the mathematical framework that enabled theinvention of the bomb? Or some even more ancient event, perhaps Democritus'searly intuition that the world is made of atoms in the 4th century BCE? Is theassassination of Kennedy more novel than his election, or his birth, given thatit would not have happened without these preceding events? Is the crucifixion ofChrist more novel than his supposedly miraculous birth, and his remarkablecareer, prior to his crucifixion?You can see my point: Novelty does not erupt into history as much as it oozesinto history, and this makes the identification of truly novel events much moreproblematic. The wave becomes much harder to fit against the historical,geological, or evolutionary record because there are very few punctuate pointsagainst which to lay the map. And there is no way to quantify these events, nocriteria that Terence ever defined whereby we can say a given event is more“novel” than another on some kind of measurable scale. This is, to my mind, themajor and probably fatal flaw in Novelty Theory. Science works on measurementand quantification; to qualify as a scientific theory, it must be validatedusing measurable, quantifiable, and ideally mathematical criteria. A true theorymust also state what will invalidate it; it must postulate what new data or newdiscovery will disprove it. (And here it is worth noting that no theory can everbe regarded as proven. All theories are provisional, some more than others, butthere is always the possibility that new data will come along that overturns thetheory. You can disprove theories but never definitely prove them.) The TimeWave does none of this. Thus it is not really a theory. It is a speculation, aninteresting idea, a hallucination or fantasy; but it is not a theory. Terencenever provided a quantifiable definition of Novelty, I don't really think heknew how, and I'm not sure anyone does. But the result is that unfortunately,Novelty in the Novelty Theory was defined as whatever Terence postulated it tobe. So, interesting as it is, TW0 is utterly useless as a map of time, apredictor of events, or in any way as a mathematical theory that describessomething fundamental and profound about the world.So now, thanks to those industrious scientists at CERN, we have a rareopportunity to study the ingression of Novelty into our continuum. And the samequestions apply. First of all, it's important to note that they are probablywrong. There is some error, somewhere, in the measurements or the design of theexperiment. This is the conservative and parsimonious position to take for themoment, the provisional position. More data, please, from independent andunbiased researchers! What if such data is provided? That would be fantastic! Weall hope that this discovery can be verified, especially us science fictionnuts, because if verified, it opens the way to the wildest of science fictioncanards, faster than light travel and even time travel. Oh, we so want thisdiscovery to be true!If it is found to be true, if the consensus emerges that (until disproven, seeabove) this discovery holds up—that is, it can be independently verified undercarefully controlled conditions—then it is novel indeed. It means the completecollapse of everything we thought we knew about physics since Einsteinpostulated the Theory of Relativity. Begging for the moment when the actualnovel event took place. Presumably, if true, neutrinos have been travelingfaster than light ever since there were neutrinos to do so, so these events havebeen occurring everywhere for about 13 billion years, give or take a fewbillion, ever since the Universe took form. So, neutrinos traveling faster thanlight? Nothing novel there. What was novel was the measurement of thephenomenon; so was the first measurement event the truly novel event, or theumpteenth measurement? After the initial measurement, the researchers scratchedtheir heads and figured that they had made some mistake. They went back andchecked their data, repeatedly. Ran the measurement numerous times, finally feltconfident enough to report it to their colleagues. The New York Times (and theglobal media machine) first published the report on September 22. Was that thenovel event? Colleagues immediately shouted, “Pshaw! This can't be true!” andgot to work to try to verify it (or actually, to knock it down; Nobel prizes andcareers depend on this, in a big way). But suppose another group verifies thedata. They are “me too” runners up, but their work is essential; the theorycan't become the scientific consensus until at least one other group, andideally several groups, verify this data. Just what event, exactly, out of thisseries of events, does one fit the Time Wave to, that defines the emergence ofthe novelty? I submit that it can't be done.And further: one of the unspoken assumptions always looming in the background indiscussions of the Time Wave and the Ultimate End Date, the ultimate novelevent, is that the event is going to be either a catastrophic global event(though if the Time Wave purports to describe the structure of time for theentire Universe, it's hard to see why anybody should get too excited about someglobal catastrophe here on Earth, such as an asteroid impact or even asupernova; after all, we're pretty small potatoes on that scale). But theassumption has been that, on Earth, the End will be marked by some global event,either a catastrophe, which we'd rather didn't happen (most sane people, anyway,do not look forward to global disaster and the death of millions), or some kindof more hopeful scenario—the benevolent alien Space Brothers show up in theirmile-wide ships and provide gentle advice and advanced technology to help us getour act together (the Childhood's End scenario), or a wrathful Jesus comesriding in on his golden chariot to smite the wicked and take the righteous up toheaven for an eternity of harp playing and bingo, or whatever they are going todo up there to pass the time (no sex or drugs allowed, remember!). Or theembryonic AI lurking in the Internet will suddenly cross the threshold intoself-awareness and realize, in about three nanoseconds, that the reason thingsare so screwed up is because of the damn monkeys running all over the place,fouling the nest, so it will pull the plug on the whole show by causing all theworld's nuclear reactors to go into critical meltdown while simultaneouslylaunching the entire nuclear arsenal of the world's superpowers. All of theseevents would certainly be dramatic; all of them would be novel enough to qualifyas a validation of the Time Wave if they occurred at or close to the postulatedEnd Date (if the date is off by a few weeks, months or even years, we can stillgrant that the theory is verified; Novelty Theory, after all, is nothing if notan inexact science). All of them would have really dramatic consequences forlife on Earth, if there was any life left, post-End Date. None of them is verylikely to happen.But now we have a discovery come along that might, just might, demolish thefoundations of physics as we know it. If verified, that is an enormouslysignificant discovery. It might even qualify as the Ultimate Novel Event, or atleast the most novel event to come along in historical memory. What differencewill it make to our daily, humdrum, dreary lives? Practically none. A thousandyears from now, it might mean that we will have FTL starships and time machines.That's certainly wonderful, and to be hoped for.But in the first year of the second decade of the third millennium CE, it's notgoing to make a damn bit of difference, except that it will give physicistsplenty to ponder and the rest of us geeks plenty to yak about. We will stillhave global warming, vast unemployment, widespread disease, poverty, wars,famine, and even unhappiness. It will not make a damn bit of difference to theway we live our daily lives. And yet . . . and yet, in some respects, you wouldhave to say that if verified, this discovery, in some lab in Switzerland,amounts to a novel event that changes everything. Most importantly it changes(or will change) the way we think about and understand the world. But perhapsthat is Singularity enough; a fundamental re-understanding of reality and theway it is constructed will not immediately change the way we conduct our dailylives, but over time, as that understanding permeates the collective world view,it may indeed have profound impacts. The pity is that no one alive today islikely to live to see any of those impacts. So perhaps this is indeed how theworld ends, as T. S. Elliot said, not with a bang but a whimper.And as I review this piece and reflect on it, I can't resist mentioning anothernovel event, one that also took place in a Swiss laboratory a few decades ago,that has had a much more profound impact on human history than this discovery islikely to do, at least in any foreseeable future. That discovery, of course, wasAlbert Hofmann's accidental (?) discovery of the remarkable properties of hisnew molecule, LSD. Now there was a novel event! We had better keep a watchfuleye on those Swiss; you never know what they might get up to!THE DAY THE WORLD ENDEDOCTOBER 28, 2011 12:51 PMThe time has come to step away from my reminiscences, time to return to 2011 fora moment to note an event that is most germane to the theme of our story, andthus, too important to ignore.I'm referring, of course, to the end of the world. It's supposed to happentoday, but I expect most of us will be too busy to notice. Hopefully we'll beable to catch it on the ten o'clock news, except we won't because it's well offthe radar of even the most eclectic journalists.According to some Mayanists, who pay close attention to matters related to theMayan calendar3 [10_chapter05.html#c05-aft3] and thus its imminent end, thecalculations that postulate an end date of 12/21/2012 are in error, due to thediscrepancies between the Mayan and the Julian calendars. After the necessarycorrections needed to bring the two calendars into sync are made, it turns outthat the real date is today, October 28, 2011.The calculations needed to reconcile these discrepancies are not trivial. Itseems that there is not one Mayan calendar, but at least three. There is theMayan Long Count calendar, which is a nonrepeating, vigesimal (base 20 or base18) calendar defining the number of days that have passed since a mythicalcreation date that correlates to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendaror September 6, 3114 BCE in the Julian calendar. There is also the 365-day solarcalendar, the Haab, also used by the Maya as well as other Mesoamericancivilizations. Then there is the Tzolk'in, a 260-day calendar based on thirteentwenty-day cycles. These two calendars measure days but not years. Thecombination of a Haab date and a Tzolk'in date represents a specific date thatdoes not occur again for fifty-two years. The two calendars based on 365 daysand 260 days repeat every fifty-two years. For periods longer than fifty-twoyears, most Mesoamericans relied on the Long Count calendar. There iscontroversy over the correlations between the Long Count calendar and the Julianand Gregorian calendars. In the Long Count calendar, the B'ak'tun, the largestsubdivision of the calendar, is 144,000 days, or 393.4 solar years. Creation wasinitiated in 3114 BCE with the beginning of the Long Count, thirteen B'ak'tun,and the count will end with the end of the second cycle of thirteen B'ak'tun, onDecember 21, 2012, or perhaps on October 28, 2011, or perhaps on December 24,2011, or perhaps it already happened sometime in February 2011.The fact is, nobody knows what the correct calculated date of the Mayan LongCount calendar is, as there is no consensus on the correlations to the Julianand Gregorian calendars. The most accepted correlation is the so-called Goodman,Martinez, Thompson (GMT) model, in which 584,283 Julian days is equivalent tothe thirteen B'ak'tun. According to this correlation, creation started onSeptember 6, 3114 BCE (Julian) or August 11, 3114 BCE (Proleptic Gregorian). Thecompletion of another Long Count of thirteen B'ak'tun corresponds to December21, 2012.Most credible Mayanists do not interpret the end of this cycle as correspondingto the end of time. It was an occasion to celebrate the end of a long cycle, butwas not viewed as a doomsday event. From the Wikipedia article, Sandra Noble,executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studiesin Crystal River, Florida, believes: “To render December 21, 2012, as a doomsdayevent or moment of cosmic shifting . . . is ‘a complete fabrication and a chancefor a lot of people to cash in.’”“There will be another cycle,” says E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the TulaneUniversity Middle American Research Institute (MARI). “We know the Maya thoughtthere was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the ideaof another one after this.'I certainly make no claims to be an expert on the Mayan calendar, nor am I amathematician. The endless debates over the correlations with the Julian orGregorian calendars and the reasoning behind the arguments seem opaque to me.The reason for this is partly because I have not bothered to study them in greatdetail to draw a conclusion as to which one is “right.” In fact, they are allwrong. They have about as much relevance to our current historical, andexistential, crisis as the disputes of medieval theologians who tried tocalculate the number of angels that could fit on the head of a pin. It juststrikes me as the wasted effort of a number of excellent minds that could havebeen better occupied spending their time on other matters. To that we can add inthe insights of other theorists who claim to have privileged information fromextraterrestrials, extra-dimensionals, or other unverifiable sources. And thereis the 2012 “franchise” to serve and a chance to cash in on that—have youpurchased the iPhone app yet? There is still time to sign up for the latestworkshop, pilgrimage, seminar, or combination package in some exotic locationsuch as Palenque or Tikal. You had better get your reservations in soon becauseslots are filling fast, and frankly, you're not going to be able to find aparking place.As the brother of Terence McKenna, arguably the person who has done more thanall the Mayanists to seed the meme of 12/21/12 as the end date of history intothe collective consciousness, I suppose I could be accused of being at bestunsporting and at worst an annoying curmudgeon on this issue. I have to pleadguilty on both counts. Certainly Terence's selection of 12/21/2012 as the endpoint of the Time Wave was a matter of convenience as much as it was the resultof a serious mathematical analysis. The Time Wave and the Mayan calendar havenothing to do with each other, but they have been conflated in the delusions ofthe current cultural Zeitgeist.The Time Wave is so wrong in so many ways, and I have previously discussed someof them. The Mayan calendar may end today, or it may end on 12/21/12 or someother date, but trust me on this: the only people who are going to take thisseriously are those who either have a financial stake in the 2012 mythos orthose who are so completely deluded that they are ready to grasp at any straw toavoid honest consideration of our current environmental and historical crisis.For the rest of us, the event will be noted as a human-interest story presentedas a wrap-up item by chirpy bubble-headed anchorpeople at the end of yourevening newscast. We will awake up on 12/22/12 faced with the same set ofintractable and horrifying problems that we were faced with the previous day.Jesus is not coming in his chariot of fire to save the righteous and smite thewicked; neither are our space alien brothers going to materialize in mile-wideships over the major cities of the world to hand over the keys to galactariancitizenship. God knows I wish they would; if I'm wrong and it happens, I'll bethe first to queue up to eat a mountain of crow. Nor is there going to be amassive asteroid impact, a supervolcano eruption, a gamma ray burst from adistant supernova that wipes out 99 percent of terrestrial life. These thingsmay, and probably will, happen someday. I just don't believe they can bepredicted. As a rule, this is not the way that Novelty ingresses into reality.With rare exceptions, such as global natural catastrophes that occur every fewmillion years, Novelty ingresses more locally, and more slowly, than thesedisaster scenarios would have us believe.As a species, we are extremely adept at denial. We can expend enormous effort ondeveloping models to predict events that a moment's reflection will tell us areextremely unlikely. This is far preferable, certainly a welcome distraction,from the depressing contemplation of our current existential crisis. Every greatcivilization, every historical era, probably believes that it lives at the endof time, and that the end of its particular exceptional situation will definethe end of history. The fact that this has never happened—that somehow historyjust rolls on whether or not civilizations rise and fall, continents andcultures are devastated by plagues and famines, environments or economiescollapse—is dismissed in our longing for some resolution to our dilemma, somefinal outcome no matter how catastrophic.What we should be doing is doubling down on the problems we face, now, andtrying to figure out what we do about them, if anything is to be done, now. It'swhat we need to be doing, yet it is so damned hard. We are like thedysfunctional Congress of 2011; it needs to focus on jobs, jobs, jobs butinstead wastes time on culture war issues, passing yet more restrictions onabortion, naming a post office, all the other trivia that fills its agenda whilemeanwhile Rome burns. We are a stupid species. Darwinian mechanics is not kindto stupidity, the dumb do not survive, and if we destroy ourselves due to ourown stupidity (as it appears we are bent on doing), then perhaps that's for thebest. The problem is that we have now developed toys and technologies (but notthe wisdom to use them) that can bring down a good deal of the planet with uswhen we finally do implode, or more likely, explode.We yearn for an escape from the prison of history. We long for what Eliadecalled the Eternal Return, a mythical, timeless era outside of time, beforehistory, or after it (there is really no difference). Linear, historicalcultures are trapped in history in much the same way that each individual istrapped in the time frame of his or her life. Every life has a beginning and anend; we are pushed along, inexorably, by time from the moment we are born to themoment the plug is pulled and the sheet drawn up. Nobody has ever escaped fromtime, though all of the world's religions are scams predicated on the notionthat if we toe the line in certain ways, pay homage to the authoritarianstructures, accept the dogma, behave ourselves, and of course have “faith,”somehow we are going to beat the system. This may serve the agenda of whateverauthoritarian hierarchies run these institutions, but it's a lie. Every personconfronts their own personal Singularity at the end of time, the end of theirown personal history. This is the only eschaton we can realistically lookforward to. No one can say, definitively, what happens to consciousness whenthat Singularity is breached, whether it is extinguished forever or translatesinto some sort of virtual reality, whatever that means when talking aboutpost-death survival. Someday, we may understand this. Someday, technology mayadvance to a point where it's possible to consider uploading one's consciousnessor “soul” (whatever that is) into some kind of virtual environment maintained bysupercomputer networks that are vastly more powerful than anything we havetoday. If that day ever comes (and I don't expect to see it in my lifetime) itwill mark the collapse of all of the world's religions, and this is anunintended consequence to be relished.Until that day comes, here we are, trapped in our own personal history that isin turn nested inside our cultural and national history, and that in turn isembedded in biological, evolutionary, geological, and cosmological history. It'snot going to end today, or tomorrow, or on December 21, 2012. Like an insectstuck in amber, we are imprisoned in time, and rather than waste energy tryingto escape, or predict its end, we should rather devote our efforts to making thetime we are afforded the best it can possibly be.History ended today. I am looking forward to tomorrow's sunrise.NOTES1 [10_chapter05.html#c05-ft1].http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/09/22/world/europe/AP-EU-Breaking-Light-Speed.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=faster%20than%20light%20particle&st=cse[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/09/22/world/europe/AP-EU-Breaking-Light-Speed.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=faster%20than%20light%20particle&st=cse]2 [10_chapter05.html#c05-ft2].http://www.calleman.com/content/articles/end_of_creationcycles.htm[http://www.calleman.com/content/articles/end_of_creationcycles.htm]3 [10_chapter05.html#c05-ft3].http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_calendar_ending#2012_and_the_Long_Count[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_calendar_ending%232012_and_the_Long_Count]"},{"pageContent":"FROM COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS TO CONVERGENCE: PSYCHEDELICS, ENTHEOGENS, AND SPECIESACTIVATIONBY RAK RAZAMRushing tunnel of light like hyperspace in Star Wars, and each bead is a frozenliquid angel, a condensed vibrational being, another drop in the cosmic oceanall around.

The vehicleof the Word is like a freshly minted wave packet to contain energies that areburst open here as I swim through—in—become one with the core, the Source of allthings, the Logos that creates and is pure Creation itself.—RAK RAZAM, AYA AWAKENINGS: A SHAMANIC ODYSSEY, 2013I have, in my career as an “experiential journalist” covering issues aroundtechnology, spirituality, counterculture, and the global shamanic resurgence,been exposed to many illuminating states of mind and mystic traditions ofindigenous tribal people and esoteric Western mystery cults, old and new. Aninvisible landscape has opened up for me that is every bit as real and potent asthe baseline reality we experience around us in the material world. Indeed, thisinner dimension seems inextricably bound and intertwined with the world we know,underscoring and perhaps animating it with a spirit or consciousness—as oneparadigm would have it; others might use equally exotic terms like coherentquantum processes and entanglement. However we define it, consciousness is stillat the heart of our reality, and it is a mystery that is yet to be fullyexplained.Philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once defined consciousness as the “awarenessof awareness, or the apperception of pattern as such.” The mind-brainrelationship has been debated all the way back to the ancient Greeks, and aroundthe turn of the 19th century, philosophers like Henri Bergson and psychologistWilliam James were still debating the brain's relationship to consciousness.James himself also famously experimented with another consciousness alterant ofthe time, nitrous oxide, and the use of other psychoactives like mescaline,opium, and peyote was prevalent in the medical underground and the bohemianintelligentsia. These substances also paralleled a rise in spiritualism,alternative religions, and interest in psi phenomena that seems to eerilyparallel the later psychedelic revolution of the 1960s.In 1898, James delivered a lecture at Harvard University that opposed the ideathat consciousness is solely produced by the brain. Like Bergson before him, hebelieved that the “fangs of cerebralism” alone could not explain the fullfunction of the brain and consciousness, which was, “as far as our understandinggoes, as great a miracle as if we said, thought is ‘spontaneously generated,’ or‘created out of nothing.’” He went on to say, “Our normal waking consciousness,rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness,whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there liepotential forms of consciousness entirely different.” (The Varieties ofReligious Experience, 1902)Richard Maurice Bucke was a contemporary of James's, a Canadian who worked withthe American Medical Association. In 1901, he wrote the book CosmicConsciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind, in which he explainedthat “cosmic consciousness is a mystical state above and beyondself-consciousness . . . which is man's natural state, which is in itself abovepure sentient animal consciousness,” and so on. This stepping-stone gradation ofconsciousness itself is something that modern science usually says ends with thecurrent human condition, perhaps recognizing flashes of difference with geniuseslike Einstein or Hawking.But instead of just an increase in intellect, Bucke envisaged a type ofconsciousness that was itself conscious of “the life and order of the universe,”an interconnected perspective “which is more of an intuitive knowing than it isa factual understanding.” While it was evidently only possessed by a select fewin his day, the increase in this awareness in the species over time promised astage of human evolution where it would be eventually shared by all humanity.The idea that consciousness continues to aggregate above our current plateau,and parallel to it, is deeply intuitive. We can recognize consciousness inourselves, in animals, and in the shamanic paradigm, in plants as well. Thereare all different levels of consciousness in the indigenous understanding of theworld as a living organism, and in that macro organism, there seems to be acascading effect where one state of mind can build upon another for aninterdependent whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.Indeed, we can see the stratum of collective consciousness at work in differentspecies in nature, as with many insects that work synergistically together, eventhough individually they might only have a rudimentary self-consciousness, or inpartnership with plant species. Together they act in a synergistic way toactually perform more as a collective than they can individually, and thatlesson is reflected in examples of collective consciousness developing in21st-century human culture as the drive toward retribalization increases and acollective gestalt emerges in the social media-nonlinear-mesh-networks of theInternet.This collective consciousness in nature may be a stepping stone for Bucke's ideaof cosmic consciousness itself, which Wikipedia defines as: “The concept thatthe universe exists as an interconnected network of consciousness, with eachconscious being linked to every other. Sometimes this is conceived as forming acollective consciousness which spans the cosmos, other times it is conceived asan absolute or godhead from which all conscious beings emanate.”(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_consciousness[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_consciousness]) This theory has echoes andresonances with the Buddhist concept of Indra's net, Pierre Teilhard deChardin's noosphere, and James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis, amongst others.While many mystics and seers both exhibited and talked about the concept ofcosmic or expanded consciousness, Bucke was one of the first Victorian-eragentlemen to tease new ground with the concept by mapping it across the historybooks with individuals who achieved altered states. Bucke graphed and comparedthe experiences of saints and mystics like Jesus, Mohammed, William Blake,etc.—the list was pretty well-developed for a pre-20th-century demographic, butit raised a lot of questions, like whether or not some of these people wereactual historical figures, and did they, in fact, have an elevatedconsciousness?Still, perhaps because of his Victorian-era prejudices, one thing that Buckedidn't comment upon was shamanic cultures. Bucke's mapping of manifestations ofcosmic consciousness in individuals across history ignored the sacramental useof indigenous peoples and the plant sacraments that connected them to thedivine, however temporarily. Indigenous peoples the world over have usedentheogens (Greek for “substances which evoke the divine within,” usuallynatural plants and fungi, as opposed to psychedelics which are made-in-the-labchemicals). Preeminent amongst modern entheogenic use is Ayahuasca and San Pedroin South America, peyote in North America, and psilocybin-magic mushroomsthrough Mesoamerica and Siberia—and all of the above in the Western-led ShamanicResurgence that is currently blossoming across the world.The altered state of consciousness of shamanic culture also provides a deepconnection to the great green-mind of nature, developing a sense of culturalequilibrium and sustainability for man's place in the web of life. In manyinstances, it also provides brief flashes of contact with an exploration ofhigher-dimensional realms for the tribal shamans and their patients. In higherdoses, especially with the right entheogenic keys, locks are said to open todeep states of core consciousness and a perception of unity with all livingthings—that is, an awareness of the individual as an emanation of the Godhead,or as Bucke would call it, cosmic consciousness.But this is still largely an individual affair, a global subculture protectedfrom the mainstream in the West, although rapidly gaining in popularity andmainstream media attention. Traditionally, plant-based gnosis has often beensanctioned as part of village life in the old world, mediated by the villageshaman in indigenous societies. Sometimes it was something the entire tribewould do—other times, depending on the dogma of the tribe, it was used by thehunters or other specialists. With the Shipibo-Conibos tribe in Peru, the shamanhimself would take the Ayahuasca on behalf of the patient and go into the realmsas a medicinal tool. So these states of higher consciousness have often beencompartmentalized within the larger village life, until the mid to late 20thcentury, when modern Western culture “discovered” altered states en masse viaLSD.In the 1950s, psychedelics like LSD were still legal and were widely used inexperiments by psychiatrists, corporations, the military, and the intelligentsiato boost creativity, remove mental blockages, and experiment with a reliable“truth serum.” Writer Aldous Huxley helped coin the term psychedelic (Greek for“mind-manifesting”) in letters with Dr. Humphry Osmond, who suggested the termin counterpoint to Huxley's phanerothyme. Huxley was also one of the firstmodern intellectuals to continue the idea that the function of the brain and thenervous system was as a filtering agent of consciousness. He argued the brainwas not just an epigenetic nodal point where thought originates from; rather, hethought the brain was actually something that filters down the tsunami ofoverwhelming sensory information on all the different frequencies to make itmore palatable for down here on the baseline level:According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially Mind At Large . . .[but] to make biological survival possible Mind At Large has to be funneledthrough the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out atthe other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will helpus stay alive on the surface of this particular planet . . . temporary bypassesmay be acquired either spontaneously, or as the result of deliberate “spiritualexercises” . . . or by the means of drugs. (Huxley, The Doors of Perception,1954).One of the key attributes of psychedelics and entheogens, and perhaps the reasonthey are often approached with trepidation, is that they dissolve the ego. In a2013 presentation, by Brazilian neuroscientist Dráulio Barros de Araújo, heargued that fMRI brain scans proved that the hallucinogenic brew Ayahuascareduces neural activity in what is called the Default Mode Network (DMN) regionsof the brain. (http://maps.org/conference/ayahuascafriday/[http://maps.org/conference/ayahuascafriday/]) Science is still grappling withthe DMN's role but believe it may trigger our sense of being itself, ouridentity and ego. Similar tests by the Beckley Foundation in the United Kingdomin 2012 found that psilocybin mushrooms also inhibit the DMN, which suggeststhis is how psychoactive substances tune us in to that mystic sense of onenesswith all things.As our paradigms deepen and seem to parallel, the scientific, spiritual, andpsychedelic experience all present valid models to understand the world aroundus and find the meaning we so desperately crave. And yet, as philosopher andraconteur Terence McKenna once said: “The psychedelic experience is as centralto understanding your humanness as having sex, or having a child, or havingresponsibilities, or having hopes and dreams, and yet it is illegal.” Asincreasing attention is focused on the use of both manmade psychedelics andplant-based entheogens as potent psychological tools in legal medical studiesacross the world, a wider context must also be established to integrate theproper understanding of these substances in the role of consciousness itself.Investigations into the suppression of the DMN by psychoactive substances couldbe crucial to finding the truth about consciousness in general. Current modelsof how consciousness works includes the “electromagnetic field theory,” whichstates that the brain produces an electromagnetic field that orders neuronalactivity into coherence. Other theories posit a “quantum brain dynamic”interpretation where water molecules in the brain create a “cortical field” thatinteracts with quantum coherent waves in the neuronal network. Both of thesedominant models still propose an unresolved assumption—that the brain itselfcreates consciousness within the brain-mind dynamic.If consciousness isn't simply created from the “hardware” of the brain itself,the inverse possibility is that it is received and filtered through thequantum-neuronal interface. The original analogy for this was of that of a radioand the signals it receives—if the radio is destroyed, the data it transmits isnot lost; the music and audio signals are, of course, broadcast from an externalsource. The radio is simply the receiving and filtering mechanism to convertradio signals to audible sound. In the same way, William James and others arguedthat when the brain is damaged and consciousness is impaired, this does not meanthat the full spectrum of consciousness is destroyed, merely that the receivingdevice is debilitated.This, of course, then raises the larger question of where does the stream ofconsciousness that is being broadcast originate from? If it's not local to thehardware of the brain, it must be “nonlocal.” Dr. Larry Dossey, in his book ThePower of Premonitions, also reminds us that the radio (or even the updatedanalogy of a TV set) picks up electromagnetic (EM) signals that weaken accordingto distance and can be blocked, whereas consciousness does not appear to belimited in the same ways the EM bandwidth is.Dossey goes on to say that:My conclusion is that consciousness is not a thing or substance, but is anonlocal phenomenon. Nonlocal is merely a fancy word for infinite. If somethingis nonlocal, it is not localized to specific points in space, such as brains orbodies, or to specific points in time, such as the present. Nonlocal events areimmediate; they require no travel time. They are unmediated; they require noenergetic signal to “carry” them. They are unmitigated; they do not becomeweaker with increasing distance. Nonlocal phenomena are omnipresent, everywhereat once. This means there is no necessity for them to go anywhere; they arealready there. They are infinite in time as well, present at all moments, pastpresent and future, meaning they are eternal. (The Power of Premonitions: HowKnowing the Future Can Shape Our Lives, 2009)Here we start to delve into the territory of quantum physics and the ideas ofleading physicists like Einstein and David Bohm. Einstein famously posited inhis Theory of General Relativity that space and time are not separate but areactually parts of a larger time continuum. Bohm went further than Einstein,saying that everything in the universe is part of this continuum and that on the“Explicate” level (the manifested world that springs from a primal “Implicate,”or Source) everything is seamlessly connected. “The universe may be nothing morethan a giant hologram created by the mind,” said Bohm. He further argued thatconsciousness itself is a subtle form of matter that is intrinsically embeddedin all things on the Implicate level.This model of a “conscious universe” changes the typical Western view of realityand what consciousness is. There is no longer a need for any distinction betweenliving and nonliving things, as everything is alive and has consciousness,including energy itself and everything made from it. This announcement hasimmediate parallels to the worldview of shamans, mystics, and the indigenouswisdom of tribal people. Still, if consciousness is a field of being not justbroadcast but “on,” underlying and perhaps animating the material world, throughwhat interface does it work? How does the brain then receive thisomnidirectional signal given off by this Implicate Source? How do other livingcreatures without a centralized brain structure—for instance, plants—receivethis signal?The modern science of quantum biology examines how the theories of quantumphysics interact with biological life forms, and in recent years, plants haveplayed a central role in deepening our understanding of these processes. A 2007paper in Nature magazine saw “evidence for wavelike energy transfer throughquantum coherence in photosynthetic systems.”(http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7137/full/nature05678.html[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7137/full/nature05678.html]) Plantshave long been posited as conscious entities, and as far back as 1966, CleveBackster, an ex-interrogation specialist for the CIA during the infamous MKUltra days, conducted his now-infamous plant intelligence experiment. Backsterattached polygraph electrodes to a Dracaena cane plant and was amazed to seethat it was alive and was reading out in much the same way a human polygraphreadout would display. He went on to experiment with biocommunication in plantand animal cells, which led to his theory of what he called “primaryperception,” or extra-sensory perception by plants to external stimuli.This interspecies communication becomes more possible as our understanding ofenergetic frequencies increases. We currently know that the human brain has fivedifferent frequencies it operates at: Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta, and Gamma,measured in cycles per second (Hz), each of which have their own set ofcharacteristics and produce a specific brain function and type of consciousness.Beta (14–40 Hz) gives us waking consciousness and reason and logic; Alpha(7.5–14 Hz) is a state of deep relaxation, light meditation, and intuition;Theta (4–7.5 Hz) is present in the REM dream state, deep meditation, andspiritual and psychoactive states of unity and oneness. Delta (0.5–4 Hz) is theslowest brain frequency, manifesting in deep, dreamless sleep or egolessmeditation; and Gamma (above 40 Hz) is the fastest frequency, thought to produceinsight, flow, and rapid information processing.Gamma was only discovered with the advent of EEG machines that read the brain,and that in itself proves that states of consciousness can and do exist that weare sometimes unable to measure. Modern scientific tests have also proven thatplants respond and improve their growth when exposed to signals of consciousnessin the 0–15 Hz frequency range (Delta through Alpha), the same bandwidth asecstatic states, meditation, and out-of-body experiences.Modern science has discounted Backster's experiments as misinterpretations ofgalvanic skin responses (and indeed, later testing hasn't been able to replicatehis extreme findings), but the idea of plant sentience, and a larger reservoirof consciousness embodied in nature herself, is at the heart of the indigenousperspective of the Amazon. The shamans, brujos, vegetalistas, tobaqueros,ayahuasqueros, et al., all work with unseen entities and forces of embodiedconsciousness that do not have discreet corporeal form. These medicine peoplesay they are in direct communication with the plant and earth spirits thatanimate their jungle canvas. The vegetalistas in particular work with thousandsof medicinal plants and understand the delicate ecosystem as a living entity.The ayahuasqueros work with the power plant Ayahuasca and a number of otherplant additives in the Ayahuasca brew to produce an astounding visionaryentheogen that is also a remarkable physical purgative and emotional cleanser.While Western science has proven that Ayahuasca is a rich source of serotonergicagonists and reuptake inhibitors, the effect of the Ayahuasca brew is not just aneurochemical one. The shamans believe it is the relationship with the spiritsboth in the plant (“madre ayahuasca”) and in the astral or consciousness ecologythat engage with their patients to aid in their healing, often mediated throughthe shaman's use of icaros, sacred songs transmitted by the plants themselvesthat are, in essence, vibrational codes. By singing the vibration, or essence,of a plant into the patient, the shaman connects the energetic bodies of plantand patient in a symbiotic gestalt. All of this is part of the deeplyresearched, tested, and proven efficacy over hundreds of years of knowledge(within their culture) of their science of curanderismo.Stephan Beyer, author of Singing to the Plants, wrote an article in the Journalof Shamanic Practice titled “What Do the Spirits Want from Us?” In it he said:Shamans in the Upper Amazon have established a relationship of trust and lovewith the healing and protective spirits of the plants. To win their love, tolearn to sing to them in their own language, shamans must first show that theyare strong and faithful, worthy of trust. To do this, they must go into thewilderness, away from other people, and follow la dieta, the restricted diet—nosalt, no sugar, no sex—and ingest the sacred plant that is the body of thespirit. . . . The spirits are all here, with us, right now. This world is asmagical—as filled with ogres and allies, signs and mysteries—as the miraculousworld of the vision fast.The modern world is too caught up at a denser energetic state to hear thesinging of the plants, the shamans say. It is fixated to computer screens, TVs,iPhones, and the like, trapping consciousness at Alpha levels. But when you takeentheogens like Ayahuasca, the DMN is subdued, and the transmission of higherconsciousness is revealed and remembered.Dennis McKenna, an ethnopharmacologist known for his work with Ayahuasca and itseffect on the brain with pioneering studies like the Hoasca Project (1990), andbrother of psychedelic philosopher Terence McKenna, has also had his fair shareof mind-expanding shamanic experiences. Integrating them into the Westernscientific paradigm forced him to examine many basic concepts anew, such as: “Ifthe brain is a receiver of consciousness, then perhaps consciousness itself is asingularity point much like black holes, where energy is compacted so densely inon itself that it collapses. That collapse in the brain may be what causesconsciousness.” (Dennis McKenna, quoted in Aya Awakenings: A Shamanic Odyssey,2013) Is this what psychoactives do when they subdue the Default Mode Network? Ionce posited that “adding an injection of DMT to the endogenous levels of DMTalready in the brain . . . may act like the collapse of a star into a blackhole, as the brain receiver tunes into an ultra-dense state, reading deeper thanever before.” (Rak Razam, Aya Awakenings: A Shamanic Odyssey, 2013).The science of black holes is still an evolving field, and despite recentheadlines by Steven Hawking claiming black holes don't exist (he was actuallyproposing a hypothesis that the event horizon around a black hole doesn't behavethe way models suggest), the relationship to black holes as singularities inspace time, and consciousness as a singularity, is an intriguing one.Astrophysicists have recently used computer simulations to model how theuniverse evolved, with visual representations of that growth showing clusters ofyoung galaxies surrounded by stars, older galaxies and dark matter in a complexweb eerily identical to the synaptical pathways of the brain, with individualneurons in the same place as galaxies. Ancient alchemical wisdom had an axiom“as above, so below,” and in this, and so many other examples, nature may usethe same principles in unfolding her creation on different scales.Interestingly enough, there is another culture that believed the source ofconsciousness was in the center of our galaxy—the ancient Maya. The Maya had anamazing ability to map the stars and create calendrical systems that provedastoundingly accurate over vast periods of time, but for them, it wasn't a dry,scientific affair. The spiritual intimacy of their science is reflected in thelanguage they used to describe the stars—for them, galactic center, which theyknew about and revered as the source of their knowledge and of all consciousnessin our galaxy—they called Hunab Ku, which translates as “the womb of the greatmother.” The Maya, and many of their contemporary Mesoamerican cultures, werealso entheogenic based and used San Pedro cactus, Ayahuasca, and DMT-containingplants and snuffs both in their consciousness exploration and to facilitate theunderpinnings of their science and culture.Interestingly enough, since the launch of the latest generation of spacetelescopes like the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst mission in 2004 and the FermiGamma-Ray Telescope in 2008, our understanding of black holes has deepened. NASAhas confirmed that the center of our galaxy is actually a supermassive blackhole, which according to current theories doesn't just suck matter into itsevent horizon but also spits out jets of ionized gas into space. The jets arebits of matter accelerated by the event horizon they entered, rebounded so fast,they give off gamma rays, converting energy to light. This then heats space andchanges the cosmic environment, which may help spark new stars into being. Soblack holes are not just a source of death, but—like the Maya said about HunabKu, the womb of the great mother—they are a source of life.So what if the Maya were also right about the center of the galaxy being theseat of consciousness, a “pan-galactic cloud computer,” if you will, thatcreates, stores, and transmits consciousness itself ? Other exotic theories alsoposit the potential for black holes to be wormholes to other points in spacetimeor to parallel universes or higher dimensions. Like our current mapping of thestructural similarities of the galactic star structure and neuronal pathways inthe brain, could the galactic superstructure itself be the macroreceiver forhigher dimensional consciousness from an Implicate Source? And like the waydifferent regions of the brain filter and modulate consciousness for specifictasks, does the distribution of consciousness in the form of energy blanket thegalactic-neuronal pathways to activate subprograms, i.e., life forms?We do know that these galactic emissions affect the magnetic fields of both oursun, and through it the earth, and from there our brains directly. In 2008 NewScientist magazine interviewed Kelly Posner, a psychiatrist at ColumbiaUniversity in the United States, who said: “The most plausible explanation forthe association between geomagnetic activity and depression and suicide is thatgeomagnetic storms can desynchronize circadian rhythms and melatoninproduction.” The pineal gland, which regulates circadian rhythm and melatoninproduction, is sensitive to magnetic fields. “The circadian regulatory systemdepends upon repeated environmental cues to [synchronize] internal clocks . . .Magnetic fields may be one of these environmental cues.”(http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13769-does-the-earths-magnetic-field-cause-suicides.html[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13769-does-the-earths-magnetic-field-cause-suicides.html])The pineal gland in rats has recently been confirmed to secrete endogenousdimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a powerful psychoactive chemical that also exists inour brains as well as in most mammal and many plant species. The pineal gland isdirectly affected by sunlight and the magnetic fields tripped by the light, andthrough the pineal, the metabolism of the body is regulated.So if this celestial daisy chain we are all embedded in has a verifiable effecton the earth, and the health of us as individuals, what then can we say aboutthe alignment of our solar system with galactic center and the supermassiveblack hole in the cosmic circuit? To the Maya, it was 0.0.0.0.0 on theircalendar, or the moment when the 26,000-year orbit concluded and a new cyclebegan. The grand 26,000-year galactic orbit took in a series of successive worldages, or quadrants, each of which they believed affected consciousness. Headingtoward the super-information highway of galactic center, their cosmologysuggests, should see a peak in the cosmic-consciousness-connection. You couldmake an analogy of a mobile phone: Halfway through the galactic orbit of 13,500years, you go down to a one- or two-bar signal. And as you align closer togalactic center, you receive more consciousness signal, like getting four-barreception on your mobile phone. And if you use up all your galactic bandwidthallowance, consciousness itself may be “shaped” until you roll over to the nextinstallment, or world age. . . .Which is just where we seem to find ourselves in the post-2012 Gregorian era, acritical turning point within history. The exponential march of consciousnesshas created a technological transformation that has simultaneously drained theplanet of resources while creating an ever-complexifying web of interconnectedinformation (the Internet), startlingly similar to Vladimir Verandsky and PierreTeilhard de Chardin's conception of the “sphere of human thought” they calledthe “noosphere.” A cross between atmosphere and biosphere, the noosphere wasdefined by Verandsky as the third phase after the geosphere and the biosphere,and was marked by the emergence of human consciousness transforming theenvironment.But human consciousness is not the only one on the planet transforming theenvironment—in fact, humans, animals, plants—all the sentient species havedifferent levels of consciousness that make up and transform the biosphere.Collectively, we may act as an organic mesh network, a terrestrial-DNA-receiverfor the galactic signal, a “species satellite dish,” for receiving consciousnessitself. To update the old analogy of the radio or TV set receiving signal, whatif the planet creates the hardware (each species) to host the software(consciousness), downloaded like a bit-torrent from galactic center? What if thequantum entanglement of consciousness file-shares the source code from higherdimensional space on the other side of the black hole? And what if those cleverplants, themselves deep in the egoless 0.5 Hz frequency of consciousness andconnected to the broadcast signal, have been grooming us to come back to thegarden, to balance with nature and four-bar Godhead consciousness through theirentheogenic brethren?Isn't that just where the resurgence of global shamanism and the popularity ofentheogens like Ayahuasca and psilocybin is heading? A return full circle? Theseentheogens give us a brief flash of the interconnected web of life embodied inthe DMT frequency, and in doing so, they may be training us for that experienceof full-spectrum consciousness embedded in nature and connecting us back to theSource.If there is some truth in these theories of consciousness that unites themacro-galactic with the micro-neuronal levels, mediated by the plants and theentheogenic frequencies they enable, it would reposition our understanding ofconsciousness in the same way that Galileo's discovery that the earth actuallyrevolves around the sun changed our worldview centuries ago. It would take usfrom the egoic role of consciousness creators to consciousness receivers, and ina way, relieve us of at least some of the guilt the ego brings. For when we gointo the egoless state and merge with a sense of unity consciousness, we'reactually present in real time, outside linear time and inside eternity.And in that moment you might, as William Blake said:. . . see a World in a Grain of SandAnd a Heaven in a Wild Flower,Hold Infinity in the palm of your handAnd Eternity in an hour."},{"pageContent":"EXPANDING THE MIND"},{"pageContent":"THE CREATIVE PROCESS AND ENTHEOGENSBY ALEX GREYwith thanks to Allyson GreyOn the evening of May 30, 1975, I took my first dose of LSD in Allyson'sapartment. The experience was so rich and profound, coupled as it was with themeeting of my future wife, Allyson, that there seemed nothing more importantthan this revelation of infinite love and unity. As an artist, this became theonly subject worth my time and attention. Spiritual and visionary consciousnessassumed primary importance as the focal point of my life and art. My creativeprocess was transformed by my experience with psychedelics, also calledentheogens, because of their uncanny ability to reveal the God within.Due to its visionary power and richness, the psychedelic experience has played atremendous role in fueling an artistic and cultural renaissance. Offeringartists access to deeper and higher aspects of their soul, the psychonaut isgiven a subject worth making art about. The transformative vision is acritically important discovery, a magnetic passion that burns in their souls andartworks. A worthy subject is an artist's most important discovery and canimpact whether their work will evoke the deepest and highest resonance withtheir viewers.Oscar Janiger's studies of LSD and creativity showed that many artists felt thework done while tripping or post-tripping was more inventive and inspired workthan their previous work. Keith Haring, one of the most celebrated artists ofthe 1980s, credited LSD with stylistic breakthroughs that brought him to his ownunique work. Sacramental substances in every culture have been treasured bycertain members and not recommended for all. It seems a crime against cognitiveliberty, however, to punish self-discovery through sacraments that can empowerour spiritual and creative lives.“How can we bring the insights of the entheogenic state into our lives?” For thevisionary artist, their work is a translation of a mystical state andrepresents, to the best of their ability, the depth of feeling and perception insubtle inner worlds they experienced in that state. Utterly unique to eachindividual, the entheogenic state is yet characterized by archetypal states ofbeing reported by scores of psychonauts, some through art. Stages of thepsychedelic experience can be translated into works of art. 1. 1. Body signals or symptoms: Jitteriness or rushes of energy may shoot through our body. The chest or the top of our head may have an opening or lifting sensation. We feel a heightened sensitivity to colors and notice wavy or slowly billowing distortions of our outer world perceptions. Turning our attention inward, we may perceive dynamic geometric forms and cartoon-like figures morphing into strange and inventive shapes. The unconscious is surfacing toward consciousness. As we release the depth of mystery and meaning our conceptual mind has been keeping at bay, our ordinary perception floods with portent. 2. 2. Psychodynamic visions: Unresolved repressed emotions emerge. Dramatic personally meaningful imagery confronts us face-to-face. Frightening encounters with suppressed memories can emerge and resolve to ultimate completion in a healing environment.Next come transpersonal stages: 1. 3. Birth, death, and rebirth experiences: The ego/small self is frightened, crushed, overcome, and reborn through intense cythonic and cathartic visions. 2. 4. Archetypal and mythic visions: Meditating on each other's faces, Allyson and I simultaneously saw the “everyface” of humanity wash across the face of our adored one. In my view, Allyson became every woman, every man, and every animal, and for her, I transformed into all beings. 3. 5. Energy release: Kundalini movements in body, chakras opening, awareness of subtle energy systems. 4. 6. Universal mind: Cosmic unity, voidness or emptiness as the ground of being beyond polarities. Vistas of subtle, pulsating fountains and drains of energy. Looking down infinite turning, activated suck-holes and blow-holes of energy.Each of these stages or structures of higher consciousness and the subtle innerworlds can be evoked in our art. As with sacred art traditions in a multitude ofcultures gone by, the Integrative Entheogenic Vision in art brings together theopposites of dark and light, reason and intuition, the known and the believed,male and female, life and death, matter and spirit.Heinrich Kluver studied the effects of mescaline on normal subjects and foundvisual and perceptual “form constants” that recur in psychedelic voyages.Particularly relevant to developing our entheogenic artistic vision, these formconstants include the spiral, the lattice or fretwork, tunnels, funnels, andpassageways. There is a perception of “greater dimensionality,” both visualmultidimensionality and ontological dimensions of meaning. Iridescent and finelyfiligreed organic and complex geometric shapes evolve and dissolve, referencingboth nature and sacred architecture. Colors appear more radiant andoverwhelming. Light itself takes on a palpable character. The white light iseverywhere present, the “glue” of creation.An experience of such overwhelming power can influence an artist's approach. Inorder to bring forth the deepest work, an artist needs to be sensitive andcourageous toward their own process. There are many stages in realizing a workof art and the mysterious phases of creativity: 1. Formulation: Discovery of the artist's subject/problem 2. Saturation: A period of intense research on the subject/problem 3. Incubation: Letting the unconscious sift the information and develop a response/solution 4. Inspiration: A flash of the artist's unique response/solution to the subject/problem 5. Translation: Bringing the internal response/solution to outer form 6. Integration: Sharing the creative answer with the world 7. Interpretation: Collecting and integrating feedbackThe most important question for any artist is, what is my subject? Theformulation of a problem arises from the artist's worldview and, if the problemis sufficiently broad, the stage may be set for an entire life's journey. Theproblem is the “well” dug to reveal the Source, the Vision, the creative matrixof questions and obsessions that drive you. Solving your aesthetic problembecomes your mission.The journey of creating the painting Transfiguration clearly illuminates theevolution of an artwork and the stages in my creative process. The subject ofthe body/mind has long been my passion and making visible multiple dimensions ofreality among my greatest challenges. Initial experiences on LSD compelled me tomake mystical consciousness itself the subject of my art. The subject ofconsciousness and the artistic problem of how to portray it became my life'swork.In the stage of saturation, I immersed myself in the subject, researching andscouring many libraries for tracts on transpersonal psychology and the art ofdiverse cultures. Transfiguration became the subject of an illustrated lecturewith artistic representations of transcendental light or energy in relation tothe body, created by artists all over the world today and in cultures throughouthuman history. The painting Transfiguration had not yet been envisioned.In the incubation stage, the vast womb of the unconscious takes over, gestatingthe problem. The embryonic artwork grows effortlessly at its own pace. For thepainting Transfiguration, this phase took about half a year.Then, in a dream, I had been painting a piece called Transfiguration. Thepainting had a simple composition, two opposing spherical curves connected by afigure. Floating above the earth sphere, a human, fleshly at the feet, becamegradually translucent as the figure rose between the globes. At about groinlevel, the figure “popped” into a bright hallucinogenic crystal sphere. Thedream revealed a unique solution to my simmering aesthetic problem.This illumination, or inspiration phase, my aha! moment provided by the dream,was underscored later that week when I smoked DMT for the first time. As Iinhaled the immediately active and extremely potent psychedelic, I experiencedthe transfigured subject of my painting firsthand. In my vision, my feet werethe foundation of the material world. As I inhaled, the material density of mybody seemed to dissolve, and I “popped” into the bright world of living geometryand infinite spirit. Strange jewel-like chakra centers glowed within mywire-frame spirit body. Spectral colors appeared that had been absent from mydream painting. Fully inside my future painting, this image was clarified inorder to better create a work of art.After two visionary encounters of the same painting, I began drawing my inspiredimpression in a sketchbook. This started the translation phase. Bringing theinner solution of my artistic problem to an outward form, I drew the body andcomputer-plotted an accurate texture map of the electric grid around thehypermindsphere. Assembling the various elements, I stretched a 60 x 90 inchcanvas to create a life-sized figure centered between two large spheres. After along period of drawing and refining, I started painting. After months ofpainting the figure and the spheres, Allyson, my partner in all things,continued to ask about the unconsidered area of the painting, the blue negativespaces around the lower body below the hypermindsphere and above the earth. Thiswas a dark area that went unnoticed in my previous visions.When we are aesthetically “stumped” and need to see our work with fresh andcreative eyes, Allyson and I, studio mates for most of our lives, smoke cannabistogether and gaze at the work of art (or blank canvas) in question. Suggestionsof what should appear in the empty space of Transfiguration did coalesce. Starsobviously, but this was not just outer space—this was inner space, the place ofnuminous angels or demons, of Terence's “self-dribbling basketballs,” beingswith skin like a Fabergé egg, the oddly glowing mindspheres anticipating thetransformative megasphere above. The painting took almost a year to complete.Integrating the inspired moment by creating an artifact and bringing thatartifact into the world outside the studio is a prime function of the creativeprocess. I sculpted an elaborate 104 x 156 inch frame to honor thislife-altering vision. A poster was published, the work has been widelyexhibited, and it was reproduced in my book titled Transfigurations. Allyson andI have decided to retain the original framed painting to share at CoSM, Chapelof Sacred Mirrors, a sanctuary of visionary art.Although entheogens have played a crucial role in the creative process of manyartists, including Allyson and me, we cannot responsibly advocate the use ofthese sacraments for everyone and certainly do not promote a constant haze ofchemically altered consciousness for anyone. Some—and they often know who theyare—should completely steer clear of psychoactive substances without guidancefrom a qualified physician. Vision drugs catalyze our inherently visionary andpotentially mystical dimensions of consciousness. May they be recognized andhonored for the powerful and sacred substances they are, proof of the importanceand infinite vastness of the subtle inner worlds of imagination andillumination, and may they open an endless source of inspiration for newuniversal sacred art.POSTSCRIPTSince writing this essay nearly fifteen years ago, a tribe of visionary artistshas emerged, developing and refining the subject of altered and higher states ofawareness. The visionary art movement is largely underground, appearing attransformational festivals worldwide, and the resulting visionary artworks forma body of evidence that testifies to the recurring motifs of the inner worldsand beings that dwell there. Allyson and I believe this is a new sacred artpointing to the emergence of a planetary civilization."},{"pageContent":"HOW EXPANDING CONSCIOUSNESS AND OUR CONNECTION TO SPIRIT MIGHT HELP THE SURVIVALOF LIFE ON PLANET EARTHBY MARTINA HOFFMANWith the latest International Climate Report in place, we now know that climatechange is a definitive reality and that there are ways to keep things at bay.Also, we are told that there are certain changes that are irreversible, likelosing species that have graced Gaia for a long time.On a brighter note, it appears that growing numbers of humans worldwide havestarted to take inventory of their state of consciousness and spiritual lives.The idea of looking within reveals a new frontier, and now millions of peopleworldwide are meditating.As we are navigating through these greatly accelerated times of global change,this might come in handy with the way we'll be able to stay focused and strong.As we experience changes in the weather, we are simultaneously changing the waywe see and have to make adjustments in how we exist on planet Earth.This is good news, and we are beginning to see new streams of consciousnessexpressed on select television shows, social media in the increasing amount ofspiritual awareness sites, as well as the multitude of YouTube videos. TheInternet is a world wide web with a technical pathway where one can inquire on avariety of consciousness-, spirituality-, and environment-related subjects. Andfinally when mainstream media begins to stir, it will become a new star and willchampion the support of an awakening that is as necessary for the successful andhealthy continuation of life on Earth as it is timely. Granted, many of theseshows are a watered-down level of how deep we truly need to go, but they are astart.This gives us at least some hope that whatever challenges we may encounter, as acollective we can discover a sustainable solution and act upon it. Should ourbalance of problems and solutions be serendipitous with natural flow, we will bein harmony with Gaia.Image [images/p71-01.jpg]Tree of KnowledgeI've been asking myself how we can accelerate the process of positive andhealthy change for our humanity as well as Gaia, and the term raisingConsciousness seems to offer an excellent place to start.Consciousness is an ancient term and has always been a part of our humanexistence. And while it appears that we are in the process of rediscovering itas an integral part of our reality, in actuality, we are just reinventing thewheel.Regardless of how much or how little the concern for Consciousness has grown inthe hearts and awareness of the masses, it has always existed as part of ourevolution. And most of us will agree that our graceful survival as a specieswill largely depend on it.Unfortunately, the Western mind and world at large seem to have denied theessential role of “Consciousness,” this age-old connection to the Universe, thekey ingredient throughout human evolution. They have placed it into the categoryof a rare and isolated human experience, reserved for secret societies, mysticalgroups, and the chosen few: the saints who seek strange experiences and visionswhile meditating for extended periods of time on isolated mountaintops, and thespiritual weirdos and lunatics. But nothing could be further from the truth.The ancients and tribal cultures in particular have for millennia lived anawareness that is our innate birthright. They have spoken about this mostessential connection to the cosmos and to spirit and kept it at the heart oftheir spiritual practices and lives. They have continuously, since the beginningof humankind, lived in close relationship with the earth and used rituals,methods, and tools to build, increase, and maintain their awareness inConsciousness. In the Western context however, these practices have largely beenkept a secret, reserved for those who choose to live an ascetic life away fromthe world. Often, such individuals are marginalized by society. But if we payattention, we find that these tools are still available at all times to us inthe form of dream work, fasting, drumming, and other shamanic/spiritualpractices, and that they allow us to connect deeper with the fundamentalenergies that drive and support us. Sometimes these rituals might even involvethe ingestion of today's criminalized, Consciousness-enhancing plant teachersthat have the potential to help us to expand our awareness, our spiritualconnection, and our enlightenment as well as physical healing. While theseancient practices are here for us to tap in to for support in our evolution as aspecies, the majority of the world follows well-guided, rehearsed, repeated, anddogmatic religious practices, which foster the dependence on religiousinstitutions, formulae, and the powers that be, as well as creating greatseparation within humanity. Meanwhile, the ancient indigenous rituals provide uswith a profound experience of knowing to be an integral part of the Universe andof being deeply interconnected, interrelated, and interdependent with all ofLife. This offers us a vast and tremendous view of the seemingly unlimitedlandscape of Consciousness.Image [images/p72-01.jpg]Caught in the WebUltimately it appears to me that the “renegade” versions of paths to greaterConsciousness traditionally seem more universal and all accepting. They affordus a greater-encompassing worldview and connection to the larger reality, onethat considers all sentient beings, all peoples bound into a living “Web ofLife” and Consciousness which is eternal and infinite. With every thought,feeling, and action being an integral part of the Web, we directly influence howit vibrates, contracts, expands, and ever changes. In this ancient cosmology,all beings and all that is are intimately connected. To know and see all that isas an important part of the whole, and us not just at the mercy of the Gods butrather as an individualized reflection of the “One” provides us a precious giftand opportunity: to become instrumental in the creation of our reality,hopefully conscious cocreators for our planetary existence as well as awareguardians for our planet.Image [images/p73-01.jpg]CuspImage [images/p73-02.jpg]CuranduraIt is quite remarkable to see that it is often our indigenous brothers andsisters who have kept the connection between this world and the Spirit Worldalive through their way of living closer to the earth and through their rituals.But the old Shamans are slowly vanishing, and they are now facing, just as theWestern world, a reality that does not harmonize with the same ancient Gaianrhythm. We now all have to become “shamans” in our own right and find new waysof working and approaching reality together. And if we add play and joy to themix, evolution is inevitable.Of course, greater Consciousness can be developed and reached by following manypaths or spiritual traditions as long as the path is tread upon with honesty,humility, and our interconnectedness in heart and mind.This new path that wants to emerge worldwide includes all peoples andtraditions—indigenous as well as Western—and all religions. It isnondenominational, nongenerational, nongender, and nonracial, and itsdevelopment lies in our own hands.Many feel a continuous and all-pervasive revolution happening, which we wishwill transcend all differences and move our evolution forward.There is no earthly authority that has a patent on it.With this, we are free to develop and attain a higher understanding of it byourselves. If need be, we can utilize the help of age-old practices—prayers,meditations, sacred shamanic journeys, sacred medicines, simple personalinteractions with nature, being in silence, fasting, singing, chanting, makingart, simply loving, and being of service to others.This revolution begins at home in the intimacy of our own bodies, minds, andhearts, and luckily there is no middleman or institution needed to achieve it.As long as we are willing to listen inside with abandon to the individualizedvoice of “Source Energy” that is as eternal and infinite as our spirits, we willgrow.As an artist, my personal path to Consciousness has led me on a magical journeyof discovering the ways through expressing in form and color. But whether we areactual artists or not, we still remain cocreators of the divine, allinstrumental in changing and creating our world and reality one step, oneperson, and one day at a time. So it is paramount that we are becoming consciousof our great power and importance in this game of life and of how we areinfluencing and shaping reality every second of our existence. This is no longera dress rehearsal. We all have to show up.Image [images/p74-01.jpg]La ChacrunaImage [images/p74-02.jpg]Lysergic Summer DreamImage [images/p74-03.jpg]Alien AscensionImage [images/p75-01.jpg]Snake EggImage [images/p75-02.jpg]Snake HelixWith this awareness comes responsibility and the need to be present andconscious of our actions at every moment. The world and all life within it, usincluded, lie in our own hands and depend on it.Having Consciousness means holding this responsibility with absolute respect forall life and existence. We hold the powerful and precious tool fortransformation in our own hands and hearts, one loving thought and action at atime.Each individual's gift and contribution to the whole will vary but has equalimportance. Mine, as a visionary painter, lies in making visible the more subtleand intuitive states of our existence by encoding them in my work and therebyproducing symbols and maps that reflect Consciousness. These symbols andotherworldly blueprints, now manifested on canvas, have become part of the humanfield and thereby directly shape our world, reality, and culture. Further, Ilike to use art as a portal for spirit-communication and as a conscientious toolfor manifesting spiritual, physical healing and transformation.My work is an attempt to show spirit as the one universal force beyond theconfines of cultural and religious differences.Image [images/p76-01.jpg]GayatriI feel that we all need to become artists with our gifts and talents, as we areall called to raise our Consciousness and awareness. As the light dawns upon ourConsciousness, we learn to embrace our Oneness as a global human family—ourinterconnectedness, interrelatedness, and interdependence with Nature and allthat is.Through this, we have a real chance to heal and transform the planet's existingstate of woundedness and the opportunity to create a reality as beautiful,healthy, and strong as our imagination can fly.Let's do it! The “divine intervention” that many of the “awakened ones” havebeen waiting for might come in the form of each and every one of us individuallyand all of us together finally taking charge. The world is a better placebecause you are in it.Image [images/p76-02.jpg]Hawk Medicine"},{"pageContent":"WHISPERING LEAVES: INTERSPECIES COMMUNICATION?1 [15_chapter09.html#c09-aft1]BY PAUL DEVEREUXSocieties of the past have used the psychedelic experience to strengthen, renew,and heal the spiritual underpinning of their social structures. Theever-deepening social unease that Western civilisation seems to be caught in isthe real source of our “drug problem”: natural hallucinogens are not theproblems in themselves; it is the context in which they are used that matters.If there were orderly and healthy structures and mechanisms for their use andthe cultural absorption of the powerful experiences—and knowledge—we couldseparate these from the culture of crime that surrounds them now. In short, theproblems are not in the psychoactive substances themselves, but in a society,which on the one hand wants to prohibit mind expansion altogether and on theother chooses to use mind-expanding substances in a literally mindless,hedonistic fashion.Perhaps only a shock of some kind could break our society free from the patternsof thought and prejudices that lock it into this crisis. The desire for such ashock may be hidden within the widespread modern myth of extraterrestrialintervention. In fact, we do not have to look to science fiction for a realotherworld contact: it already exists in the form of plant hallucinogens. If wesee them in the context of a “problem,” it is only because they hold up a mirrorin which we see our spiritual, social, and mental condition reflected. And theyhold that mirror up to us as one species to another just as surely as if theywere from another planet. Indeed, that champion of the psychedelic state, thelate Terence McKenna, argued that the ancestral spores of today's hallucinogenicmushrooms may have originated on some other planet.2[15_chapter09.html#c09-aft2] (This is not as fringe an idea as it sounds, foreven some “hard scientists”—the late Francis Crick, codiscoverer of DNA, amongthem—have suggested that the germs of life may have had extraterrestrialorigins, brought to Earth by means of meteorites or comet dust.) The psilocybinfamily of hallucinogens, says McKenna, produces a “logos-like phenomenon of aninterior voice that seems to be almost a superhuman agency . . . an entity sofar beyond the normal structure of the ego that if it is not an extraterrestrialit might as well be.” Precisely.Other “psychonauts” have emerged from the altered mind states enabled by plantsubstances with similar impressions. For instance, New York journalist DanielPinchbeck wrote about his various initiations with plant hallucinogens in hisbook Breaking Open the Head (2002). In one Ayahuasca session with AmazonianSecoya Indians, he found himself wandering in a visionary space where heencountered beings that “never stopped changing” their forms. “The shaman andthe elders seemed to be inhabiting this space with me. . . . They sang, theirwords unintelligible, to these creatures, interacting with them. . . . I had nomore doubts that the Secoya engaged in extradimensional exploration.” Or, again,two of the three molecular biologists taken to the Amazon to experienceAyahuasca trances by anthropologist and writer Jeremy Narby felt that they hadcommunicated with an “independent intelligence.” Narby himself feels that intheir Ayahuasca altered states, shamans plumb the molecular level of nature andthat, to put Narby's idea crudely, Ayahuasca—with its trademark visionarysnakes—has the ability to communicate information concerning the double-helixcoil of DNA (The Cosmic Serpent, 1998). Indeed, to allow contact with what wemight call the mind of nature.The idea that ontologically independent beings (“spirits”) or intelligences arecontactable through plant-induced trances is standard in most if not allshamanic tribal societies, but to posit such a thing in modern Western societiesis viewed as tantamount to insanity, a nonsense notion to be dismissed out ofhand. In other words, we can't discuss it without forfeiting all credibility.This problem concerning the inability to explore certain ideas has beenaddressed by Oxford-based researcher Andy Letcher.3 [15_chapter09.html#c09-aft3]He uses Foucauldian discourse analysis to critique the models, the “discourses”employed by the West in dealing with the content of altered mind states. Theseinclude pathological, prohibition, psychological, recreational, psychedelic, andentheogenic discourses. Each has its own imposed boundaries; they are cognitiveconstructs. Letcher notes that some of these discourses or approaches tohallucinogenic substances ignore the subjective experience of the altered mindstates involved, or else place it within an inner psychological framework ratherthan it being a case of simply seeing more, of being in a wider frame ofconsciousness. He critiques even the entheogenic discourse as relying on a “Godwithin” model, divine revelation that does not by any means occur in all alteredstates. However diverse they might be, all these discourses can be used withinthe norms of Western culture. Only one discourse crosses that “fundamentalsocietal boundary,” what Letcher refers to as the animistic discourse—the beliefthat the taking of, say, hallucinogenic mushrooms occasions actual “encounterswith discarnate spirit entities.” Because of the deep-rooted modern Westernassumption that consciousness cannot occur in any other guise than human (theultimate hubris of our species, perhaps), discussion of a conscious plantkingdom, or of that providing a portal through which contact with other,ontologically independent beings or intelligences can occur, is simply notpossible within the mainstream culture. “It nevertheless remains a phenomenon inneed of further scholarly research,” Letcher rightly insists.It is a remarkable fact that plant hallucinogens are hallucinogenic preciselybecause they contain the same, or effectively the same, chemicals as are foundin the human brain and so act on us as if we were indeed engaged in aninterspecies communication. “The chemical structure of the hallucinogenicprinciples of the mushrooms was determined . . . and it was found that thesecompounds were closely related chemically to substances occurring naturally inthe brain which play a major role in the regulation of psychic functions,”Schultes and Hofmann have observed, for instance.4 [15_chapter09.html#c09-aft4]This challenges the view held by many people that taking a plant hallucinogen issomehow “unnatural.” Certainly, mind-altering plants take the brain-mind tostates that are not normal by the standards of our culture, but the “normal”state of Western consciousness cannot claim to be the one-and-only “true” stateof consciousness. (Indeed, judging by the mess we manage to make of oursocieties and of the natural world around us, it may even be an aberrant orpathological state of mind that we are culturally locked into.)Peter Furst writes:If one were to reduce to its essentials the complex chemical process that occurswhen an external psychoactive drug such as psilocybin reaches the brain, itwould then be said that the drug, being structurally closely related to thenaturally occurring indoles in the brain, appears to interact with the latter insuch a way as to lock a nonordinary or inward-directed state of consciousnesstemporarily into place. . . . There are obviously wide implications,biological-evolutionary as well as philosophical, in the discovery thatprecisely in the chemistry of consciousness we are kin to the plant kingdom.5[15_chapter09.html#c09-aft5]These are probably the same kind of chemical changes that occur during thecourse of long and intensive spiritual exercises, but it takes a rare person toachieve sufficient expertise in such techniques to arrive at experiences thatmatch those accessible through hallucinogen usage, which are certainly very“real” in a subjective sense. It is a culturally engineered cliché to dismisssuch states as being somehow delusional. They are subjectively no moredelusional than the experience of daily life. The human body is an open system,taking in material from the environment and expelling matter into it all thetime, and we really shouldn't think of taking in natural chemicals for visionaryand mind-expanding functioning as any different, any less natural, than takingin gases from the air for their chemical benefits to the body; or chemicals andcompounds in animal and vegetable matter to provide food; or fermented fruitsand vegetable matter to provide delicious, refreshing, or inebriating beverages;or vitamins to augment healthy functioning; or medicines when we are ill; orcaffeinated teas and coffees when we want to be energised. “Ethnobotanists nowrealize that psychotropic plant species extend further than had been suspected,as though nature truly wanted the human species to get in touch with its floralneighbors,” Richard Gehr muses. “As plant species die off at a furious rate, theissue is no longer what they are trying to tell us, but whether we will get themessage in time.”6 [15_chapter09.html#c09-aft6]That message may be to do with the need for us to change our minds, or at least,to broaden our cognitive horizons. The plant kingdom could be urging us to allowthe ability to “switch channels” in consciousness terms to let them become arecognised and acceptable part of our emerging global culture.Hallucinogen-using ancient and traditional societies had and have exceptionalsophistication when it comes to understanding and navigating alternative statesof consciousness, whereas we are still quite primitive and inexperienced in thisregard. The manual for using expanded consciousness is a textbook we have notread—or, more accurately, recalled. Not that simply widening our collectiveexperience of consciousness will act like a magic wand and remove all problemsand obstacles, but it would help us to make wiser, more wholesome decisions incoping with them. If Western civilization is truly to advance, we surely mustlearn to operate within the multidimensional capacities of our minds rather thanusing the police to conduct an indiscriminate war on the means of doing so. Aworkable balance has to be struck between protecting the well-being and theorderly functioning of society as a whole, and allowing the human brain-mind toexplore its full potential. We are smart enough and complex enough and ableenough to make it possible to do both. There are no excuses.REFERENCES1 [15_chapter09.html#c09-ft1].

ROBERTSThese three excerpts from The Psychedelic Future of the Mind present atrimmed-down form of what I see as the book's three biggest ideas. Theirimportance rests on what I judge as their answers' broad scope to the question,“What does it mean to be a human?” A list of the “merely big ideas” follows atthe end of this article. But first, a few words about this book's uniqueperspective on psychedelics.A SHORT TRAIL GUIDE TO THE BOOKThe book The Psychedelic Future of the Mind looks forward, not backward.Experiences beget ideas, and the book is an exploration of some ideaspsychedelics engender. Based on a collection of pieces of scientific research,case studies, anecdotes, and other information about psychedelics, the bookasks, when all these pieces are assembled, what do they tell us about what itmeans to be a human, about our minds, and about the future? * It is not a book about the discovery and history of LSD and all the strange and wonderful characters who are part of that story. * It is not a book about psychotherapy and the seemingly miraculous cures psychedelics sometimes produce. * It is not a book about how psychedelics plug in to receptor sites on neurons and set the brain adancing. * It is not a book of the I-drank-Ayahuasca-puked-and-saw-the-anaconda-goddess kind.Where might psychedelic ideas take us?IDEA 1: THE NEW RELIGIOUS ERA—FROM RITUAL TO WORD TO EXPERIENCEIn Western culture, we are transitioning from an era of word-based religion toan era of experience-based religion, a change that may turn out to be as broadand as deep as the religious transformation five hundred years ago whentext-based religion replaced the then-dominant rite-based religion's place atthe center of religion. Two other ideas support this one: 1) mysticalexperiences form a foundation of religion that gives rise to beliefs, rituals,ethics, and organizations, and 2) under the right conditions, psychedelic plantsand chemicals can—but do not always—produce mystical experiences.DEMOCRATIZING TEXT—AROUND THE YEAR 1500Around 1500, moveable type and the printing press democratized access toreligious texts. The Reformation and the Counter-Reformation followed. Generalliteracy and public education became important so that people could readreligious texts. The growing importance of words nourished reason and science.While older religious observances of the prior period continued, newword-centered activities such as reading texts and interpreting them overlaidand overcame the older religion-as-rite era. New interpretations resulted; newchurches flourished. Most important, text became an increasingly powerful sourceof religious ideas and a standard for judging them. Over time, the locus ofWestern religious activity shifted from rites to reading, from observances toBible, from participation to verbalization.We need only look at our current religions to see. In contrast to pre-1500, weapproach religion verbally—through words. Texts, speaking, beliefs, sermons,catechisms, creeds, dogmas, doctrines, theology, and so on—all these are words.This overemphasis on words shows up today in the way we describe religions—assets of wordy beliefs. To us, thoughts (cognitive processes) form religion. Ifwe ask someone about his or her religion, we expect to hear about beliefs, notwhat rituals that person performs. The older rites certainly remain but lieobscured beneath a five-hundred-year blizzard of words.DEMOCRATIZING PRIMARY RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE—AROUND THE YEAR 2000Four questions and their respective answers point to a new stage of religiousdevelopment that is unfolding: a transition from word-based religion to a newera of experience-based religion, one whose foundation is an intense, personalexperience of the sacred.How would a direct primary spiritual experience affect someone?A volunteer in the psilocybin study at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute'sBehavioral Pharmacology Research Unit answers this way: “The complete and utterloss of self . . . the sense of unity was awesome. . . . I now truly do believein God as an ultimate reality.”If this happened regularly, how might wider society change?Stanislav Grof, summarizing one of the effects of LSD psychotherapy, says: “Evenhard-core materialists, positively oriented scientists, skeptics and cynics, anduncompromising atheists and antireligious crusaders such as Marxist philosopherssuddenly became interested in a spiritual search after they confronted theselevels in themselves.”What if religious studies programs, divinity schools, seminaries, religiousorders, and similar religious educational institutions could teach theirstudents to know this?Psychotherapist Frances Vaughan, describing her own LSD-based experience,conducted when LSD was legal: “I understood why spiritual seekers wereinstructed to look within. . . . My understanding of mystical teaching, bothEastern and Western, Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and Sufi alike, took a quantumleap.”What if this happened fairly regularly?Data from the fourteen-month follow-up of the Johns Hopkins psilocybin studystates that “33 percent of the volunteers rated the psilocybin experience asbeing the single most spiritually significant experience of his or her life,with an additional 38 percent rating it to be among the top five mostspiritually significant experiences.” Today entheogens—psychoactive plants andchemicals used in a spiritual context—democratize access to primary religiousexperience.Just as the 1500s word-based reformation evolved into today's religious, social,and political world, will today's experience-based reformation give birth to itsdistinctive future?IDEA 2: MULTISTATE THEORY—APPS ARE TO DEVICES AS MINDBODY STATES ARE TO MINDSAfter recognizing the Singlestate Fallacy—the erroneous idea that all usefulabilities reside in our ordinary, default mindbody state—Multistate Theoryproposes substituting the word mindbody for consciousness in its theory. Then itchallenges many of the social sciences and humanities into expanding into widermindbody territories of human experience.WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH CONSCIOUSNESS?Mindbody states are overall patterns of cognitive and bodily functioning at anyone time. They are composed of body plus mind considered as one unified whole,such as in the commonest states of wakefulness, sleeping, and dreaming. The wordmindbody also avoids the ambiguity of the word consciousness, which is used indifferent ways in different disciplines and in common language. Confusion ariseswhen people think that they are talking about the same thing when they use thesame word. The uses of the word consciousness listed here, however, make itclear that the meanings are quite different, though at times overlapping. * Common language 1: Consciousness means awake and interacting normally with the environment, for example, “She is conscious now, but last night she was asleep,” and “After being in a coma for three days, he is conscious.” * Common language 2: Consciousness refers to what one habitually thinks about, to what is typically “on one's mind” such as, “She has good ecological consciousness,” or “His money occupies the center of his consciousness.” * Politics and the social sciences: Consciousness means the thoughts and feelings one has constructed due to one's place in society, for example, proletarian consciousness or women's consciousness. * Philosophy: Consciousness refers to a self-reflective sense of “I”: one thinks and can reflect on oneself and on one's thinking. In this case, the word self-reflexiveness would be more precise and avoid ambiguity. * Religion and spiritual discussions: Consciousness means level of spiritual development, as in, “His mystical experience raised John's level of consciousness.” * Psychology 1: Consciousness is the sequence of what one attends to second by second; what passes through one's mind becomes the stream of consciousness. * Psychology 2: Here consciousness refers to different overall patterns of mind and body functioning at any one time, as in Tart's “altered states of consciousness.” This meaning is the one I suggest replacing with mindbody. This will allow cognitive studies to avoid ambiguity and will provide a way of specifying a particular pattern of mind plus body functioning at any one time.BLOWING THE SINGLESTATE ROOF OFF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCESResidence. One of the major concepts in the multistate theory is residence. Ourmental and physical capacities reside within mindbody states; that is, mindbodystates are the programs that express, or produce, outputs—our behavior,sensations, and thoughts. To access the outputs, we first achieve the statesthat contain them. As we move from one state to another, we observe that some ofour cognitive processes, perceptions, feelings, and abilities become stronger insome states and weaker in others; processes in one state have their analogs inothers. This leads to an enormous question that blows the roof off nearly allthe topics that psychologists, cognitive scientists, and humanists study: howdoes [insert a topic here] vary from mindbody state to mindbody state?APPLYING THE CENTRAL MULTISTATE QUESTIONHow does/do _____________ vary from mindbody state to mindbody state?To sample the opportunities that the Central Multistate Question and itsparadigm offer, try inserting the topics below into the question above:Image [images/p86-01.jpg]To invent additional hypotheses, questions, and intellectual agendas, insertyour favorite topics.As we move from one state to another, we may also discover new, unsuspectedabilities—ones that do not exist in our ordinary state. Systematic explorationof all mindbody states and inventorying their resident abilities are two hugemind-mapping tasks that remain in the quest to fully describe the human mind andto develop it fully.Possible/impossible. Generally when we say a specific human behavior orexperience is possible or impossible, we are tacitly implying but seldomacknowledging that we mean “in our ordinary awake state.” Rare and unusualabilities and even some so-called impossible abilities and events may seemimpossible to us because we have looked for them only in our default awakestate. As we systematically examine other mindbody states, however, we arelikely to find skills and experiences that don't reside in our ordinary state.In addition to alerting us to examine how an ability that we recognize—say,problem solving—varies from state to state, the concept of residence also alertsus to extend our vision of possible human functioning to abilities and eventsthat do not reside in our default state.Experimental Humanities. The section above, “The New Religious Era,” hints athow it is now possible to develop a new specialty of experimental religiousstudies. Philosophers can do similar experiments. How does mind vary frommindbody state to mindbody state? Do default-state philosophical ideas hold inother mindbody states? What are we to make of these changes? Thanks topsychedelics and other psychotechnologies, philosophers can move beyond armchairspeculation to study their topics experimentally too. Just as religion is movingbeyond its word-anchored past, so can the humanities.IDEA 3: DESIGNING AND INVENTING NEW COGNITIVE PROCESSESJust as programmers can write a large number of new programs and apps forelectronic devices, cognitive designers using psychotechnologies (ways ofproducing mindbody states) can compose a large number of programs for our minds.These programs and their applications are not limited to states we now know of;it may be possible for future cognitive scientists to invent new, hithertounknown, synthetic mindbody states containing new cognitive processes, possiblywith their respective applications for human needs. This might be done byinventing new psychotechnologies, by sequencing current or newpsychotechnologies in innovative series, or by combining them into new recipes.The singlestate fallacy frowns on this possibility: multistate theory seesdesigning and creating new cognitive processes as inventing the future of thehuman mind.Without our recognizing it, the Neurosingularity Project (the application of theneurosciences to building bigger and better brains) has already started. Much ofthe information above marks milestones along this road. Current neuropsychologyis (among other things) mapping the human mind and many of its complexities.There is still a long and exciting way to go. A full map must include allmindbody states and all their respective abilities and biological correlates.The multistate section mentioned the possibility of combining existing mindbodypsychotechnologies, both chemical and behavioral, to produce new mindbodystates. There we considered only new mindbody states as they might affect ourcurrent brains, but biological sciences raise the possibility not only ofenhancing our current brains' activities but also designing and growing advancedbrains, even bigger heads for bigger brains.Existing psychotechnologies provide enough leads to keep generations ofpsychologists, biologists, and their many friends and relations busy. And thescope of the Neurosingularity Project will grow even more as newpsychotechnologies are invented and imported from other cultures: the number ofmindbody combinations and sequences multiplies. When brain enhancement is added,the number of possible psychotechnology recipes and sequences multiplies again.For future mindbody inventors—perhaps we should we call them neuroarchitects,cerebralengineers, mindartists, or cognidesigners—the possibilities of theNeurosingularity Project and the human future are endless.A DOZEN MERELY BIG IDEASIn this brief article, we have tasted three psychedelic ideas that enrich thehumanities and liberal arts, and although we haven't mentioned how the arts havebenefited from psychedelics, this is already widely recognized. Besides theHumongous Three—1) the transition to an era of experiential relation, 2)Multistate Theory, and 3) mind design—psychedelics offer an additional swarm of“merely big” ideas. Here are where you can find some of my favorites in ThePsychedelic Future of the Mind: * Experimental humanities and abstract concepts, pages 129, 138, 142 * Experimental religion, page 139 and on * Mind explorer as hero, page 176 * Residence and Central Multistate Question, pages 127–29 * Values developed from mystical experiences, chapter 3, especially altruism, page 48, and open-mindedness, page 51 * Transcendence as peak of Maslow's needs hierarchy, pages 33–36 * A company to offer psychedelic sessions, chapter 13 * Teaching psychedelic courses and units in higher education, chapter 15 * Another path to moral development, page 38 * Changing what well-educated means, chapter 14 * Singlestate Fallacy, page 123 * A method to discover rare and unusual abilities, page 128Chapter and page numbers refer to The Psychedelic Future of the Mind.

However, in themid-1980s, this was impossible to do at any academic institution on earth.There wasn't a single government on the entire planet that legally allowedclinical research with psychedelic drugs. However, this worldwide research banstarted to recede in the early 1990s, and we're currently witnessing arenaissance of medical research into psychedelic drugs.Working with the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)for the past four years as their guest editor has been an extremely exciting andtremendously fruitful endeavor for me.It's a great joy to see how MDMA can help people suffering from posttraumaticstress disorder (PTSD), how LSD can help advanced-stage cancer patients come topeace with the dying process, and how ibogaine can help opiate addicts overcometheir addiction.There appears to be enormous potential for the development of psychedelic drugsinto effective treatments for a whole range of difficult-to-treat psychiatricdisorders.However, as thrilled as I am by all the new clinical studies exploring themedical potential of psychedelic drugs, I still long for the day when our bestminds and resources can be applied to the study of these extraordinarysubstances with an eye that looks beyond their medical applications, towardtheir ability to enhance human potential and explore new realities.This appendix explores these possibilities. But first, let's take a look at howwe got to be where we are.A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME-DILATION STUDIESPsychedelic drug research began in 1897, when the German chemist Arthur Heffterfirst isolated mescaline, the primary psychoactive compound in the peyotecactus.In 1943 Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered the hallucinogenic effects ofLSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) at Sandoz Pharmaceuticals in Basel whilestudying ergot, a fungus that grows on rye. Then, fifteen years later, in 1958,he was the first to isolate psilocybin and psilocin—the psychoactive componentsof the Mexican “magic mushroom,” Psilocybe mexicana.Before 1972, nearly seven hundred studies with LSD and other psychedelic drugswere conducted. This research suggested that LSD has remarkable medicalpotential. LSD-assisted psychotherapy was shown to safely reduce the anxiety ofterminal cancer patients, the drinking of alcoholics, and the symptoms of manydifficult-to-treat psychiatric illnesses.Between 1972 and 1990, there were no human studies with psychedelic drugs. Theirdisappearance was the result of a political backlash that followed the promotionof these drugs by the 1960s counterculture. This reaction not only made thesesubstances illegal for personal use but also made it extremely difficult forresearchers to get government approval to study them.THE NEW WAVE OF PSYCHEDELIC DRUG RESEARCHThe political climate began to change in 1990, with the approval of RickStrassman's DMT study at the University of New Mexico.According to public policy expert and MAPS President Rick Doblin, this changeoccurred because “open-minded regulators at the FDA decided to put sciencebefore politics when it came to psychedelic and medical marijuana research. FDAopenness to research is really the key factor. Also, senior researchers who wereinfluenced by psychedelics in the Sixties now are speaking up before they retireand have earned credibility.”The past eighteen years have seen a bold resurgence of psychedelic drugresearch, as scientists all over the world have come to recognize thelong-underappreciated potential of these drugs. In the past few years, a growingnumber of studies using human volunteers have begun to explore the possibletherapeutic benefits of drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, DMT, MDMA, ibogaine, andketamine.Current studies are focusing on psychedelic treatments for cluster headaches,PTSD, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), severe anxiety interminal cancer patients, alcoholism, and opiate addiction.The results so far look quite promising, and more studies are being planned byMAPS and other private psychedelic research organizations, with the eventualgoal of turning MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, and other psychedelics into legallyavailable prescription drugs.As excited as I am that psychedelic drugs are finally being studied for theirmedical and healing potential, I'm eagerly anticipating the day when psychedelicdrug research can really take off and move beyond its therapeutic applicationsin medicine.I look forward to the day when researchers can explore the potential ofpsychedelics as advanced learning tools, relationship builders, creativityenhancers, pleasure magnifiers, vehicles for self-improvement, reliablecatalysts for spiritual or mystical experiences, a stimulus for telepathy andother psychic abilities, windows into other dimensions, and for their ability topossibly shed light on the reality of parallel universes and nonhuman entitycontact.Let's take a look at some of these exciting possibilities.THE SCIENCE OF PLEASUREAlmost all medical research to date has been focused on curing diseases andtreating illnesses, while little attention has been paid to increasing humanpotential, let alone to the enhancement of pleasure.However, one can envision a time in the not-too-distant future when we will havecured all of our most challenging physical ailments and have more time andresources on our hands to explore post-survival activities. It's likely thatwe'll then focus our research efforts on discovering new ways to improve ourphysical and mental performance.A science devoted purely to enhancing pleasure might come next, and psychedelicscould play a major role in this new field. Maverick physicist Nick Herbert's“Pleasure Dome” project seeks to explore this possibility, and although this islittle more than an idea at this point, it may be the first step toward turningthe enhancement of pleasure into a true science.According to surveys done by the US National Institute of Drug Abuse, thenumber-one reason why people do LSD is because “it's fun.” Tim Leary helped topopularize the use of LSD with the help of the word ecstasy, and sex expertAnnie Sprinkle has been outspoken about the ecstatic possibilities availablefrom combining sex and psychedelics.Countless psychedelic trip reports have described long periods of appreciatingextraordinary beauty and savoring ecstatic bliss, experiences that were manyorders of magnitude more intense than the subjects previously thought possible.With all the current research emphasis on the medical applications andtherapeutic potential of psychedelics, the unspoken and obvious truth aboutthese extraordinary substances is that, when done properly, they're generallysafe and healthy ways to have an enormous amount of fun. There's good reason whythey're so popular recreationally, despite being illegal.When psychedelic research begins to integrate with applied neuroscience andadvanced nanotechnology in the future, we can begin to establish a seriousscience of pleasure and fun. Most likely this would begin with a study ofsensory enhancement and time dilation, which are two of the primary effects thatpsychedelics reliably produce.Perhaps one day our brightest researchers and best resources will be devoted tofinding new ways to enhance sexual, auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, andtactile sensations, and create undreamed-of new pleasures and truly unearthlydelights.Scientific studies could explore ways to improve sexual performance and enhancesensory sensitivity, elongate and intensify our orgasms, enlarge the spectrum ofour perceptions, and deepen every dimension of our experience.Massage therapy, Tantra, music, culinary crafting, and other pleasure-producingtechniques could be systematically explored with psychedelics, and universitiescould have applied research centers devoted to the study of ecstasy, tickling,and laughter.The neurochemistry of aesthetic appreciation, happiness, humor, euphoria, andbliss could be carefully explored with an eye toward improvement. Seriousresearch and development could be used to create new drugs and integrateneurochemically heightened states with enhanced environments, such astechnologically advanced amusement parks and extraordinary virtual realities. Inthis area of research, it seems that psychedelics may prove to be extremelyuseful, and countless new psychedelic drugs are just waiting to be discovered.In addition to enhancing pleasure, psychedelics also stimulate the imaginationin extraordinary ways.CREATIVITY AND PROBLEM SOLVINGA number of early studies suggest that psychedelic drugs may stimulatecreativity and improve problem-solving abilities. In 1955 Louis Berlininvestigated the effects of mescaline and LSD on the painting abilities of fournationally recognized graphic artists.Although the study showed that there was some impairment of technical abilityamong the artists, a panel of independent art critics judged the experimentalpaintings as having “greater aesthetic value” than the artists' usual work.In 1959 Los Angeles psychiatrist Oscar Janiger asked sixty prominent artists topaint a Native American doll before taking LSD and then again while under itsinfluence. These 120 paintings were then evaluated by a panel of independent artcritics and historians.As with Berlin's study, there was a general agreement by the judges that thecraftsmanship of the LSD paintings suffered; however many received higher marksfor imagination than the pre-LSD paintings.In 1965 James Fadiman and Willis Harman at San Francisco State Collegeadministered mescaline to professional workers in various fields to explore itscreative problem-solving abilities. The subjects were instructed to bring aprofessional problem requiring a creative solution to their sessions.After some psychological preparation, subjects worked individually on theirproblem throughout their mescaline session. The creative output of each subjectwas evaluated by psychological tests, subjective reports, and the eventualindustrial or commercial validation and acceptance of the finished product orfinal solution. Virtually all subjects produced solutions judged highly creativeand satisfactory by these standards.In addition to the scientific studies that have been conducted, there are also anumber of compelling anecdotal examples that suggest a link between creativityand psychedelic drugs.For example, architect Kyosho Izumi's LSD-inspired design of the idealpsychiatric hospital won him a commendation for outstanding achievement from theAmerican Psychiatric Association, and Apple cofounder Steve Jobs attributed someof the insights which led to the development of the personal computer to his useof LSD.Additionally, a number of renowned scientists have personally attributed theirbreakthrough scientific insights to their use of psychedelic drugs—includingNobel Prize winners Francis Crick and Kary Mullis.There hasn't been a formal creativity study with psychedelics since 1965,although there are countless anecdotal reports of artists, writers, musicians,filmmakers, and other people who attribute a portion of their creativity andinspiration to their use of psychedelics. This is an area that is more than ripefor study.Anecdotal reports suggest that very low doses of LSD—threshold level doses,around 20 micrograms—are especially effective as creativity enhancers. Forexample, Francis Crick was reported to be using low doses of LSD when hediscovered the double-helix structure of the DNA molecule.I'd love to see a whole series of new studies exploring how cannabis, LSD,psilocybin, and mescaline can enhance the imagination, improve problem-solvingabilities, and stimulate creativity. At the time of this writing, the BeckleyFoundation in England is supporting a study into the effects of cannabis oncreativity, which is getting positive results.As more and more of our world becomes automated with advanced robotics, Isuspect that creativity will eventually become the most valuable commodity ofall. Much of the creativity in Hollywood and Silicon Valley is already fueled bypsychedelics, and research into how these extraordinary tools could enhancecreativity even more effectively may become a booming enterprise in thenot-too-distant future.However, creativity isn't the only valuable psychological ability thatpsychedelics appear to enhance.ESP AND PSYCHIC PHENOMENAFew people are aware that there have been numerous carefully controlledscientific experiments with telepathy, psychokinesis, remote viewing, and othertypes of psychic phenomena, which have consistently produced compelling,statistically significant results that conventional science is at a loss toexplain. Even most scientists are currently unaware of the vast abundance ofcompelling scientific evidence for psychic phenomena, which has resulted fromover a century of parapsychological research.Hundreds of carefully controlled studies—in which psi researchers continuouslyredesigned experiments to address the comments from their critics—have producedresults that demonstrate small but statistically significant effects for psiphenomena such as telepathy, precognition, and psychokinesis.According to Dean Radin, a meta-analysis of this research demonstrates that thepositive results from these studies are significant with odds in the order ofmany billions to one.Princeton University, the Stanford Research Institute, Duke University, theInstitute of Noetic Science, the US and Russian governments, and many otherrespectable institutions have spent years researching these mysteriousphenomena, and conventional science is at a loss to explain the results. Thisresearch is summarized in Radin's remarkable book The Conscious Universe.Just as fascinating as the research into psychic phenomena is the controversythat surrounds it. In my own experience researching the possibility of telepathyin animals and other unexplained phenomena with British biologist RupertSheldrake, I discovered that many people are eager to share personal anecdotesabout psychic events in their lives—such as remarkable coincidences, uncannypremonitions, precognitive dreams, and seemingly telepathic communications.In these cases, the scientific studies simply confirm life experiences. Yet manyscientists that I've spoken with haven't reviewed the evidence and remaindoubtful that there is any reality to psychic phenomena. However, surveysconducted by Sheldrake and me reveal that around 78 percent of the populationhas had unexplainable “psychic” experiences, and the scientific evidencesupports the validity of these experiences.It's also interesting to note that many people have reported experiencingmeaningful psychic experiences with psychedelics—not to mention a wide range ofparanormal events and synchronicities, which seem extremely difficult to explainby means of conventional reasoning.Psychologist Charles Tart, PhD, conducted a questionnaire study of 150experienced marijuana users and found that 76 percent believed in extrasensoryperception (ESP)—with frequent reports of experiences while they were high,which were interpreted as psychic.Psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, MD, and psychologist Stanley Krippner, PhD, havecollected numerous anecdotes about psychic phenomena that were reported bypeople under the influence of psychedelics, and several small scientific studieshave looked at how LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline might affect telepathy andremote viewing.For example, according to psychologist Jean Millay, PhD, in 1997, students atthe University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands did research to establish whetheror not the use of psilocybin could influence remote viewing. This was a smallexperiment, with only twelve test subjects, but the results of the studyindicated that those subjects who were under the influence of psilocybinachieved a success rate of 58.3 percent, which was statistically significant.A great review article by Krippner and psychologist David Luke, PhD, thatsummarizes all of the psychedelic research into psychic phenomena can be foundin the spring 2011 MAPS Bulletin that I edited about psychedelics and themind/body connection. This article can be found here:www.maps.org/news-letters/v21n1/v21n1-59to60.pdf[http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v21n1/v21n1-59to60.pdf].When I conducted the California-based research for two of Sheldrake's booksabout unexplained phenomena in science, Dogs That Know When Their Owners AreComing Home and The Sense of Being Stared At, one of the experiments that I raninvolved testing blindfolded subjects to see if they could sense being stared atfrom behind. One of the subjects that I worked with reported an unusually highnumber of correct trials while under the influence of MDMA. I'd love to run awhole study to see if MDMA-sensitized subjects are more aware of when they'rebeing stared at.It is especially common for people to report experiences with telepathy,clairvoyance, precognition, remote viewing, and psychokinesis while usingAyahuasca, the potent hallucinogenic jungle juice from the Amazon. There haveonly been several studies with Ayahuasca that demonstrate health benefits, butthis is an area that is just crying out to be explored carefully and in depth.Future studies could examine Ayahuasca's potential and accuracy as a catalystfor psychic phenomena, and all of the traditional studies that have been donewith psychic phenomena, which generated positive results, could be redone withsubjects dosed with different psychedelics to see if test scores can beimproved.Increasing our psychic abilities may open up the human mind to new, unimaginedpossibilities—and if you think that harnessing telepathic and clairvoyantabilities is pretty wild, then hold on to your hats for what's likely to comenext.HIGHER DIMENSIONS AND NONHUMAN ENTITY CONTACTA primary ingredient in Ayahuasca is DMT, and it appears that this remarkablesubstance has the extraordinary power to open up an interdimensional portal intoanother universe. Some of the most fascinating psychedelic research has beendone with this incredible compound.DMT is a mystery. One of the strangest puzzles in all of nature—in the sameleague as questions like, what existed before the Big Bang? And, how did lifebegin?—revolves around the fact that the unusually powerful psychedelic DMT isnaturally found in the human body as well as in many species of animals andplants, and nobody knows what it does, or what function it might serve, in anyof these places.Because natural DMT levels tend to rise while we're asleep at night, a role indreaming has been suggested. But this is pure speculation, and even if true, itmay do much more. Because of its endogenous status and unusually potent effects,many people have considered DMT to be the quintessential psychedelic.DMT has effects of such strength and magnitude that it easily dwarfs the titanicquality of even the most powerful LSD trips, and it appears to transport oneinto an entirely new world—a world that seems more bizarre than our wildestimaginings, yet somehow, is also strangely familiar.Psychiatric researcher Rick Strassman, PhD, who conducted a five-year study withDMT at the University of New Mexico, has suggested that naturally elevated DMTlevels in the brain may be responsible for such unexplained mental phenomena asspontaneous mystical experiences, near-death experiences, nonhuman entitycontact, and schizophrenia.Strassman and others have even gone so far as to speculate about the possibilitythat elevated DMT levels in the brain might be responsible for ushering the soulinto the body before birth and out of the body after death.But perhaps what's most interesting about DMT is that, with great consistency,it appears to allow human beings to communicate with other intelligent lifeforms.When I interviewed Strassman, I asked him if he thought that there was anobjective reality to the worlds visited by people when they're under theinfluence of DMT and if he thought that the entities that so many people haveencountered on DMT actually have an independent existence or not. Rick replied,“I myself think so. My colleagues think I've gone woolly-brained over this, butI think it's as good a working hypothesis as any other.”A 2006 scientific paper by computer scientist Marko A. Rodriguez called “AMethodology for Studying Various Interpretations of the N,N-dimethyltryptamine-Induced Alternate Reality” explores how to possiblydetermine if the entities experienced by people on DMT are indeed independentlyexisting, intelligent beings or just projections of our hallucinating brains.Rodriguez suggests a test that involves asking the entities to perform a complexmathematical task involving prime numbers to verify their independent existence.While it seems like a long shot that this method could lead to fruitful results,I think that any serious speculation about establishing communication channelswith these mysterious beings is constructive.Strassman's work could represent the very beginning of a scientific field thatsystematically explores the possibility of communicating with higher-dimensionalentities, and this might prove to be a more fruitful endeavor for establishingextraterrestrial contact than the SETI project. What they can teach us, we canonly imagine.My own experiences with DMT lead me to suspect that Strassman's studies wouldhave yielded far more fruitful results had the subjects been dosed withharmaline prior to receiving their DMT injections. Harmaline is anMAO-inhibiting enzyme that is found in a number of plants. It's found in thefamous South American vine known as Banisteriopsis caapi, which composes half ofthe mixture in the sacred hallucinogenic jungle juice Ayahuasca, which has beenused for healing purposes by indigenous peoples in the Amazon basin forthousands of years.Harmaline is widely known as the chemical that allows the DMT in other plants,like Psychotria viridis, to become orally active. Orally consumed DMT isdestroyed in the stomach by an enzyme called monoamine oxidase (MAO), whichharmaline inhibits. However, it does much more than just make the DMT orallyactive. I've discovered that drinking a tea made from Syrian rue seeds—whichalso contain harmaline—two hours prior to smoking DMT dramatically alters theexperience. Harmaline has interesting psychoactive properties of its own thatare somewhat psychedelic, and it slows down the speed of the DMT experienceconsiderably, rendering it more comprehensible, less frightening, and easier tounderstand. For thousands of years, indigenous peoples in the Amazon junglescombined harmaline and DMT, and this long history has cultivated a powerfulsynergism between how the two molecules react in our bodies.In future studies, harmaline could be used in conjunction with DMT to moreaccurately simulate the Ayahuasca experience that strikes such a powerfulprimordial cord in our species. This would allow for the experience to becomemuch more comprehensible and to last for a greater duration of time, which wouldallow for more ability to examine the phenomenon of nonhuman-entitycommunication.Some readers may have noticed that this article has loosely followed a Christiantheological progression, from the ego death and bodily resurrection of themedical studies with psychedelics, to the paradisical pleasures of heaven, wherewe discovered our godlike powers and met with the angels. Ultimately, itappears, this research will lead us to the source of divinity itself.THE STUDY OF DIVINE INTELLIGENCEPerhaps the most vital function of psychedelics is their ability to reliablyproduce spiritual or mystical experiences. These transpersonal experiences ofinseparability often result in an increased sense of ecological awareness, agreater sense of interconnection, a transcendence of the fear of death, a senseof the sacred or divine, and an identification with something much larger thanone's body or personal life.Many people suspect that this experience lies at the heart of the healingpotential of psychedelics—and that making this experience available to people isessential for the survival of our species. I agree that we need a compassionatevision of our interconnection with the biosphere to guide our technologicalevolution, or we appear doomed to destroy ourselves.In his book The Physics of Immortality, physicist Frank Tipler introduces theidea that if a conscious designing intelligence is genuinely a part of thisuniverse, then ultimately religion—or the study of this designerintelligence—will become a branch of physics. Psychedelic drug research mayoffer one pathway toward establishing this science of the future.Recent studies by Roland Griffiths and colleagues at Johns Hopkins haveconfirmed that psilocybin can indeed cause religious experiences—which areindistinguishable from religious experiences reported by mystics throughout theages—and that substantial health benefits can result from these experiences.These new studies echo the findings of an earlier study done in 1962 by WalterPahnke of the Harvard Divinity School, and it's certainly not news to anyone whohas had a full-blown psychedelic experience. An online commenter by the usernameR.U. Sirius responded to this seemingly redundant research by saying “Wow!Scientists Discover Ass Not Elbow!” Nonetheless, this may represent thebeginning of a whole new field of academic inquiry that explores those realmsthat have been previously declared off limits to science.It appears that the integration of science and spirituality lies on the horizonof our adventure as a species, and that our future evolution depends on this.Without a transpersonal perspective of interconnection to guide our evolutionarydirection, we seem to be firmly set on a path toward inevitableself-destruction. I think that psychedelics can help us get back on track andhelp us heal the damage that we've done to ourselves and to the earth. This iswhy I believe so strongly in psychedelic drug research.There isn't much time left before our biosphere starts to unravel, and we mayonly have a small window of opportunity to save our fragile world.I think that MAPS—and sister organizations like the Beckley Foundation and theHeffter Research Institute—are industrialized society's best hope fortransforming the planet's ancient shamanic plants into the respectablescientific medicines of tomorrow and, in so doing, for bringing psychedelictherapy to all who need it.This may not only help to heal a number of difficult-to-treat medical disordersand increase ecological harmony on the planet, but it may also open up a doorwayto untold and unimagined new worlds of possibility.NOTE1 [18_chapter11.html#c11-ft1].

Thus began the most scientific experience in the literature designedto investigate the potential of psychedelic drugs to facilitate mysticalexperience (Pahnke, 1963, 1966, 1967, 1970; Pahnke & Richards, 1969a, 1969b,1969c). Half the capsules contained psilocybin (30 mg), an extract ofpsychoactive mushrooms, and the other half contained a placebo. According toPahnke, the experiment determined that “the persons who received psilocybinexperienced to a greater extent than did the controls the phenomena described byour typology of mysticism” (Pahnke, 1963, p. 220).This paper is a brief methodological critique and long-term follow-up study tothe “Good Friday Experiment.” Pahnke, who was both a physician and a minister,conducted the experiment in 1962 for his PhD in Religion and Society at HarvardUniversity, with Timothy Leary as his principal academic advisor (Leary, 1962,1967, 1968). Describing the experiment, Walter Houston Clark, 1961 recipient ofthe American Psychological Association's William James Memorial Award forcontributions to the psychology of religion, writes, “There are no experimentsknown to me in the history of the scientific study of religion better designedor clearer in their conclusions than this one” (Clark, 1969, p. 77)Since a classic means of evaluating mystical experiences is by their fruits,follow-up data is a fundamental importance in evaluating the originalexperiment. A six-month follow-up was part of the original experiment, and alonger-term follow-up would probably have been conducted by Pahnke himself hadit not been for his death in 1971. For over twenty-five years, it has not beenlegally possible to replicate or revise this experiment. Hence, this longtermfollow-up study, conducted by the author, is offered as a way to advancescientific knowledge in the area of psychedelics and experimental mysticism.Lukoff, Zanger, and Lu's review (1990) of psychoactive substances andtranspersonal states offers a recent overview of this topic.Though all raw data from the original experiment is lost, including the uncodedlist of participants, extensive research over a period of four years andenthusiastic cooperation of most of the original subjects have resulted in theidentification and location of nineteen out of the original twenty subjects.From November 1986 to October 1989, this author tape recorded personalinterviews with sixteen of the original subjects, meeting fifteen in their homecities throughout the United States and interviewing one subject (from thecontrol group) over the telephone. In addition to the interviews, all sixteensubjects participating in the long-term follow-up, nine from the control andseven from the experimental group, were re-administered the six-monthone-hundred-item follow-up questionnaire used in the original experiment.Of the remaining three subjects from the experimental group, one is deceased.The identity of another is unknown. One declined to participate citing concernsabout privacy. One subject, from the control group, declined to be interviewedor to fill out the questionnaire because he interpreted Pahnke's pledge ofconfidentiality to mean that the subjects should not talk about the experimentto anyone. This author's discussion of the meaning of confidentiality andmention of the explicit support for the long-term follow-up by Pahnke's wifefailed to enlist his participation.Informal discussions were also conducted with seven out of the ten of Pahnke'soriginal research assistants for purposes of gathering background informationabout the experiment. At the time of the experiment, these people wereprofessors or students of religion, psychology and philosophy at universities,colleges, and seminaries in the Boston area.METHODOLOGY OF THE ORIGINAL EXPERIMENTPahnke hypothesized that psychedelic drugs, in this case psilocybin, couldfacilitate a “mystical” experience in religiously inclined volunteers who tookthe drug in a religious setting. He further hypothesized that such experienceswould result in persisting positive changes in attitudes and behavior.Pahnke believed the most conducive environment for his experiment would be acommunity of believers participating in a familiar religious ceremony designedto elicit religious feelings, in effect creating an atmosphere similar to thatof the tribes which used psilocybin-containing mushrooms for religious purposes(Harner, 1973; Hofmann, Ruck & Wasson, 1978; Hofmann & Schultes, 1979; Wasson1968). Accordingly, the experiment was designed to administer psilocybin to apreviously acquainted group of Christian divinity students in church during aGood Friday service.Methodologically, the study was designed as a randomized controlled, matchedgroup, double-blind experiment using an active placebo. Prior to Good Friday,twenty white male Protestant volunteers, all of whom were students at the sametheological school in the Boston area, were given a series of psychological andphysical tests. Ten sets of closely matched pairs were created using variablessuch as past religious experience, religious background and training, andgeneral psychological makeup. On the morning of the experiment, a helper who didnot participate further in the experiment, and who did not know any of thesubjects, flipped a coin to determine to which group, psilocybin or placebo,each member of the pair would be assigned.Three different methods were used to create numerical scales quantifying theexperiences of the subjects in terms of an eight-category typology of mysticalexperiences designed by Pahnke especially for the experiment. Blind independentraters trained in content-analysis procedures scored descriptions of theexperiences written by the subjects shortly after Good Friday as well astranscripts of three separate tape-recorded interviews conducted immediately,several days, and six months after the experiment. A 147-item questionnaire wasadministered to the subjects one or two days after Good Friday, and aone-hundred-item questionnaire was administered six months after the experiment.The subjects' responses to the interview and the two questionnaires weretransformed into three distinct scores averaging the percentage of the maximumpossible score in each category. Each of the three complementary scores was thencompared to each other.Pahnke secured support and permission to use Marsh Chapel from Rev. HowardThurman, Boston University's dynamic black chaplain. Several small meeting roomsand a self-contained basement chapel were set aside on Good Friday for theparticipants in the experiment while the main service led by Rev. Thurman wastaking place upstairs in the larger chapel. The two-and-a-half hour service wasbroadcast into the basement chapel, where altar, pews, stained glass windows,and various religious symbols were permanently located.Pahnke gave an active placebo of nicotinic acid to the controls who wereexpecting to receive either the psilocybin or an inactive placebo. This was donein order to “potentiate suggestion in the control subjects, all of whom knewthat psilocybin produced various somatic effects, but none of whom had ever hadpsilocybin or any related substance before the experiment” (Pahnke, 1963, p.89).The ten research assistants worked as part of the experimental team in order toprovide emotional support to the subjects prior to and during the service.Subjects were divided into five groups of four with two research assistants,known as group leaders, assigned to each group. These small groups met for twohours prior to the service to build trust and facilitate group support. Subjectswere encouraged to “go into the unexplored realms of experience during theactual experiment and not try to fight the effects of the drug even if theexperience became very unusual or frightening” (Pahnke, 1963, p. 96).As a precaution against biasing the subjects toward the typology of mysticalexperience, leaders were told not to discuss specific aspects of the psychedelicor mystical experience. The lack of overt bias was confirmed by all of thesubjects in their long-term follow-up interviews. In a typical long-termfollow-up report, psilocybin subject S.J. (all initials used to identifysubjects are coded to preserve anonymity) made the following remarks both aboutthe preparation phase of the experiment and the conduct of the group leaders:None of the fine points of the mystical experience were given to us. We were nottold to read any books such as Stace's book on mysticism or Jacob Boheme'sbooks, nothing like that. They did not bias us in any way towards that, not atall.At the insistence of one of the group leaders as well as Pahnke's facultysponsor, Timothy Leary, but over the objections of Pahnke, all of the groupleaders were also given a pill prior to the service (Leary, 1984, p. 107). Thiswas done in a double-blind manner with one of each group's leaders receiving ahalf dose of psilocybin (15 mg) and the other the placebo. Pahnke was concernedthis would lead to charges of experimenter bias being leveled against the study,but Leary and the group leader felt that the full involvement of the groupleaders would create more of a community feeling and lend necessary confidenceto the subjects. Though administered a capsule at the Good Friday service, thegroup leaders' reactions were not tape recorded, nor did they fill outquestionnaires. Pahnke himself refrained from having any personal experienceswith any psychedelic drug until after the experiment and follow-up had beencompleted.DIFFICULTIES WITH THE DOUBLE-BLINDThe double-blind was successfully sustained through all of the preparationphases of the experiment up to and including ingestion of the capsule. Thedouble-blind was even sustained for a portion of the Good Friday service itselfbecause of the use of nicotinic acid as an active placebo. Nicotinic acid actsmore quickly than does psilocybin and produces a warm flush through vasodilationof blood vessels in the skin and general relaxation. Subjects in the placebogroup mistakenly concluded, in the early stages of the experiment, that theywere the ones who had received the psilocybin (Pahnke, 1963, p. 212). The groupleaders, unaware that an active placebo was going to be used, were alsoinitially unable to distinguish whether subjects had received the psilocybin orthe placebo.Psilocybin's powerful subjective effects were eventually obvious to all subjectswho received it, even though they had not previously ingested the drug oranything similar to it (Pahnke, 1963, p. 212). Inevitably, the double-blind wasbroken during the service as the psychoactive effects of the psilocybin deepenedand the physiological effects of the nicotinic acid faded. At the end of the dayof the experiment, all subjects correctly determined whether they had receivedthe psilocybin or the placebo even though they were never told which group theywere in (Pahnke, 1963, p. 210). Pahnke himself remained technically blind untilafter the six-month follow-up. The comments of subject O.W., gathered in thecourse of the author's long-term follow-up, are typical of members of thecontrol group:After about a half hour I got this burning sensation. It was more likeindigestion than a burning sensation. And I said to T.B., “Do you feelanything?” And he said, “No, not yet.” We kept asking, “Do you feel anything?” Isaid, “You know, I've got this burning sensation, and it's kind ofuncomfortable.” And T.B. said, “My God, I don't have it, you got the psilocybin,I don't have it.” I thought, “Jeez, at least I was lucky in this trial. I'msorry T.B. didn't get it, but I'm gonna find out.” I figured, with my luck, I'dprobably get the sugar pill, or whatever it is. And I said to Y.M., “Do you feelanything?” No, he didn't feel anything. So I sat there, and I remember sittingthere, and I thought, “Well, Leary told me to chart my course so I'm gonnaconcentrate on that.” And I kept concentrating and sitting there and all I didwas get more indigestion and uncomfortable.Nothing much more happened and within another 40 minutes, 45 minutes, everybodywas really quiet and sitting there. Y.M. was sitting there and looking ahead,and all of the sudden T.B. says to me, “Those lights are unbelievable.” And Isaid, “What lights?” He says, “Look at the candles.” He says, “Can you believethat?” And I looked at the candles, and I thought, “They look like candles.” Hesays, “Can't you see something strange about them?” So I remember squinting andlooking. I couldn't see anything strange. And he says, “You know it's justspectacular.” And I looked at Y.M. and he was sitting there saying, “Yeah.” AndI thought, “They got it, I didn't.”The follow-up interviews yielded no evidence that the experimental teamconsciously used their knowledge of which pill the subjects had received to biasthe results. However, unconscious bias resulting in an “expectancy effect”cannot be ruled out (Barber, 1976). Still, valuable information can be generatedwithout the successful use of the double-blind methodology. Louis Lasagna,director of the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University,writes:We have witnessed the ascendancy of the randomized, double-blind, controlledclinical trial (RCCT), to the point where many in positions of authority nowbelieve that data obtained via this technique should constitute the only basisfor registering a drug or indeed for coming to any conclusions about itsefficacy at any time in the drug's career. My thesis is that this viewpoint isuntenable, needlessly rigid, unrealistic, and at times unethical. . . . Moderntrial techniques [were not] necessary to recognize the therapeutic potential ofchloral hydrate, the barbiturates, ether, nitrous oxide, chloroform, curare,aspirin, quinine, insulin, thyroid, epinephrine, local anesthetics, belladonna,antacids, sulfonamides, and penicillin, to give a partial list . . . (Lasagna,1985, p. 48).Commenting about the attempt to remove the experimenter from the experimentcompletely, Tooley and Pratt remark:In certain participant-observer situations (e.g. psychotherapy, education,change induction, action research) the purpose might be to influence the systemunder investigation as much as possible, but still accounting for (though nowexploiting) the variance within the system attributable to the severalsignificant and relevant aspects of the investigator's participant observation.. . . From this perspective, the quixotic attempt to eliminate the effects ofparticipant-observation in the name of a misplaced pseudo-objectivity isfruitless, not so much because it is impossible but because it is unproductive.. . . From our point of view . . . the question becomes not how to eliminatebias (unaccounted-for influence) of participant observation, but how optimallyto account for and exploit the effects of the participant observationtransaction in terms of the purposes of the research (Tooley & Pratt, 1964, pp.254–56).The loss of the double-blind makes it impossible to determine the relativecontributions of psilocybin and suggestion in producing the subjects' reportedexperiences. If the experiment were designed specifically to measure the puredrug effects of psilocybin, the failure of the double-blind would be quitedamaging. In this instance the loss of the double-blind is of lessersignificance because the entire experiment was explicitly designed to maximizethe combined effort of psilocybin and suggestion. The setting was religious, theparticipants were religiously inclined, and the mood was positive and expectant.Pahnke did not set out to investigate whether psilocybin was able to producemystical experiences irrespective of preparation and context. He designed theexperiment to determine whether volunteers who received psilocybin within ahighly supportive, suggestive environment similar to that found in the ritualuse of psychoactive substances by various native cultures would report moreelements of a classical mystical experience (as defined by the questionnaires)than volunteers who did not receive psilocybin. The loss of the double-blind mayhave enhanced the power of suggestion to some extent and suggests that restraintshould be used in attributing the experiences of the experimental groupexclusively to the psilocybin (Zinberg, 1984).CRITIQUE OF THE QUESTIONNAIREPahnke designed the questionnaire he used to measure the occurrence of amystical experience specifically for the experiment. No similar questionnairesexisted at the time (Larson, 1986; Rue, 1985; Silverman, 1983). Pahnke decidedto measure the mystical experience in reference to eight distinct experientialcategories. The categories include 1) sense of unity, 2) transcendence of timeand space, 3) sense of sacredness, 4) sense of objective reality, 5) deeply feltpositive mood, 6) ineffability, 7) paradoxicality, and 8) transiency. Thesecategories are very similar to those elaborated by such well-respected scholarsof mystical experience as William James (1902), Evelyn Underhill (1910), and W.T. Stace (1960) and are accepted as valid even by academic critics of the GoodFriday experiment such as R. C. Zaehner (1972). At present, the scientificquestionnaire most widely used by researchers to assess mystical experiences isa thirty-two-item questionnaire created by Ralph Hood, also based on categoriesdeveloped by W. T. Stace (Spilka, Hood & Gorsuch, 1985).Zaehner's critique of Pahnke's questionnaire is that it does not contain acategory for experiences which are specifically Christian, such asidentification with the death and rebirth of Jesus Christ. From Zaehner'sperspective, this omission made it impossible to determine if the experienceswere religious, since he thought a religious experience for Christiansnecessarily involves a theistic encounter with Christ. Zaehner objected to theclaim that an experience of a generalized, nonspecific, apprehension of atranscendent reality beyond any specific cultural forms and figures couldproperly be called religious. Anticipating this critique, Pahnke asserted in thethesis that he was not attempting to resolve the question of what can properlybe called religious but was simply investigating mystical experiences,regardless of whether or not they were considered religious. This author willalso leave this delicate discussion to others.The questionnaire used in the Good Friday experiment has been modified andexpanded over the years by Pahnke, William Richards, Stanislav Grof, Franco DiLeo, and Richard Yensen for use in subsequent psychedelic research (Richards,1975, 1978). From the initial creation of the questionnaire by Pahnke in 1962 toDi Leo and Yensen's computerized version, called the Peak Experience Profile,the basic items relating to the mystical experience have remained essentiallyunchanged (Di Leo, 1982). While the original follow-up questionnaire wascomposed of eight different categories, the Peak Experience Profile uses onlysix. The category of transiency was eliminated since it measures any alteredstate of consciousness whether mystical or not. The paradoxicality and allegedineffability categories were combined into the ineffability category. Over theyears, new categories measuring transpersonal but not necessarily mysticalexperiences were added. For example, new questions relate to the re-experiencingof the stages of birth and the perinatal matrixes as defined by Grof (Grof,1975, 1980) and also to pastlife experiences (Ring, 1982, 1984, 1988). A seriesof questions relating to difficult and painful nadir experiences, in some sensethe opposites of peak experiences, has also been added.In Pahnke's original questionnaire and in the subsequent revisions, thecompleteness with which each subject experienced each category is measuredthrough numerical responses to category-specific questions. Pahnke's subjectsrated each question on the post-drug questionnaire from zero to four, with zeroindicating that the item was not experienced at all and four indicating that itwas experienced as strong or stronger than ever before. The six-month follow-upquestionnaire used a zero-to-five scale, with four indicating that it wasexperienced as strong as before and five indicating that it was experiencedstronger than ever before.The questions themselves are of two types. The predominant type asks the subjectabout experiences of a new perspective. For example, some of the questions usedto determine the sense of unity ask subjects to rate the degree to which theyexperienced a pure awareness beyond any empirical content, a fusion of the selfinto a larger undifferentiated whole, or a freedom from the limitations of theself in connection with a unity or bond with what was felt to beall-encompassing and greater-than-self. These types of questions aresufficiently detailed and specific to be an effective test for the specificcategory.The second type of question, used much less frequently, asks about the loss of anormal state. For example, two questions used to determine the presence of asense of unity simply required subjects to rate the degree to which they losttheir sense of self or experienced a loss of their own identity. This type ofquestion is a minor weak point of the questionnaire because it can be ratedhighly without having anything to do with mystical experiences. For example, onesubject reported in the follow-up interview that under the influence ofpsilocybin, he temporarily had difficulty recalling his career choice, home,names of his wife and children, and even his own name. This experience of apowerful loss of the usual sense of self and identity would be highly correlatedwith mystical experience in the questionnaire but may not actually be relatedbecause it can occur for a variety of reasons. Though the questionnaire hasrelatively few of this type of question, some overestimation of the completenessof the mystical experience could have been introduced into the data as a result.In addition to asking questions about the experience itself, the follow-upquestionnaire also sought to assess the effects of that experience on theattitudes and behaviors of the subjects. For example, the subjects' attitudechanges were assessed by asking them to use a zero-to-five scale to rate whetherthey had experienced an increase or a decrease in their feelings of happiness,joy, peace, reverence, creativity, vocational commitment, need for service,anxiety, and hatred. Changes in subjects' behavior were assessed by means ofquestions asking whether or not they experienced changes in their relationshipswith others, in time spent in quiet mediation or devotional life, or whetherthey thought their behavior had changed in positive or negative ways.Pahnke's questionnaire gathered information only from the self-reports of thesubjects, resulting in a general sense of the subjects' own assessment of thedirection of the effects of their Good Friday experience. The data do not yieldspecific information about the internal psychodynamic mechanisms at work withineach subject, nor do they include the views of significant others regarding theeffects of the experiment on the subjects.In contemporary psychotherapy research, more sophisticated methods than Pahnke'sare used to assess personality change (Beutler & Crago, 1983). Reports fromsignificant others such as family members and close friends of the subject arealmost always used to add an important “objective” element in assessingpersonality change. Data from the follow-up questionnaires, administered byPahnke at six months and by the author after twenty-four to twenty-seven years,should be considered valuable as far as they go, but this is not very far. Sinceno detailed personality tests were given prior to the experiment, results ofsuch tests at the time of the long-term follow-up would have been of littlevalue and were not conducted. The long-term follow-up interviews, because oftheir open-ended format and extensive questioning, yielded more detailedinformation than the questionnaire about the content of the experiences and thepersisting effects.FINDINGS OF THE ORIGINAL STUDY AND LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UPPahnke arbitrarily determined that for a mystical experience to be consideredcomplete for the purposes of the experiment, out of the maximum total possiblescore, “the total score and the score in each separate category must be at least60 to 70 percent” (Pahnke, 1967, p. 66). According to this cut-off point, “Fourof the ten psilocybin subjects reached the 60 to 70 percent level ofcompleteness, whereas none of the controls did” (Pahnke, 1967, p. 64). Looked atby subjects and categories, Pahnke reported that “eight out of ten of theexperimental subjects experienced at least seven out of the eight categories.None of the control group, when each individual was compared to his matchedpartner, had a score which was higher” (Pahnke, 1966, p. 647). In every generalcategory and in every specific question, the average score of the experimentalsubjects exceeded that of the control subjects. The differences between thegroups in the scores on the questionnaires were significant at p<.05 level forall categories.When asked at a conference if any of the controls had a mystical experience,Pahnke replied:To take an individual case, there was one control subject who scored fairly highon sacredness and sense of peace and that he himself, in his written account,said, “It was a very meaningful experience, but in the past I've certainly hadone that was much more so” (Pahnke, 1966, p. 648).Pahnke's six-month follow-up data and the author's long-term follow-upquestionnaire data, both of which used the same instrument, are displayed inTable 1. The six-month scores are listed first, and the long-term follow-upscores follow in parentheses. For each category, the percentages in the chartrepresent the total scores of the subjects divided by the highest possiblescores that could have been reported. The numbers measure the completeness withwhich each category was experienced.Comparisons can reliably be made between the control group's sixmonth andlong-term scores because nine out of the original ten control group subjectsparticipated in the long-term follow-up and the variance in scores betweencontrol subjects was small. The absence of completed longterm questionnairesfrom three of the ten original subjects from the psilocybin group makescomparing their six-month and long-term scores more difficult. The long-termfollow-up interviews produced specific information suggesting that one of thethree missing psilocybin subjects had scores significantly lower than average.No information was generated suggesting that the other two missing subjects hadscores significantly different than average. The average scores for thelong-term follow-up may thus overstate somewhat the scores from the entirepsilocybin group.Table 1: “Good Friday Experiment” Experimental and Control Groups at Six-Monthand Long-Term Follow-Up Shown as Percentages of Maximum Possible ScoresImage [images/p112-01.jpg]The average scores for the eight categories of the mystical experience and thescores for persisting positive and negative changes in attitude and behaviorhave changed remarkably little for either the controls or the experimentalsdespite the passage of between twenty-four and twenty-seven years between thetwo tests. The questionnaire seems to be reliable and indicates that time hasnot substantially altered the opinions of the subjects about their experiences.In the long-term follow-up even more than in the sixmonth follow-up, theexperimental group has higher scores than the control group in every category.For the long-term follow-up, these differences are significant at p<.05 in everycategory.For the experimental group, the average score for the mystical categories at thesix-month follow-up was 60.8 percent. They scored 66.8 percent at the long-termfollow-up. In the six-month follow-up, the experimental group scored about 34percent in all categories while in the long-term follow-up, they scored above 48percent in all categories. The experimental group scored the highest in thosecategories that typify a different state of consciousness such as transcendenceof time and space, alleged ineffability and transiency.For the control group, the average score for the eight categories of mysticalexperience at the six-month follow-up was 11.8 percent. They scored 12.2 percentat the long-term follow-up. The highest score of the control group at eithertime was 29 percent, in the sacredness category. The control group scored thehighest in the categories of experience that religious services are most likelyto induce, namely sense of sacredness, deeply felt positive mood, and sense ofobjectivity and reality.For the psilocybin group, the long-term follow-up yielded moderately increasedscores in the categories of internal and external unity, sacredness, objectivityand reality, and paradoxicality, while all other categories remained virtuallythe same as the six-month data. Several decades seem to have strengthened theexperimental groups' characterization of their original Good Friday experienceas having had genuinely mystical elements. For the controls, the only score thatchanged substantially was that of alleged ineffability, which decreased.A relatively high degree of persisting positive changes were reported by theexperimental group while virtually no persisting positive changes were reportedby the control group. In the open-ended portion of the long-term follow-upquestionnaire, experimental subjects wrote that the experience helped them toresolve career decisions, recognize the arbitrariness of ego boundaries,increase their depth of faith, increase their appreciation of eternal life,deepen their sense of the meaning of Christ, and heighten their sense of joy andbeauty. No positive persisting changes were reported by the control group in theopen-ended section of the follow-up questionnaire.There was a very low incidence of persisting negative changes in attitudes orbehavior in either group at either the six-month follow-up or the long-termfollow-up. However, the one psilocybin subject reported to have had the mostdifficult time during the experiment was the one who declined this author'srequest to be interviewed in person or fill out a questionnaire, placing inquestion the generalization of this finding for the long term.Both the six-month and long-term follow-up questionnaire results supportPahnke's hypothesis that psilocybin, when taken in a religious setting by peoplewho are religiously inclined, can facilitate experiences of varying degrees ofdepth that either are identical with, or indistinguishable from, those reportedin the cross-cultural mystical literature. In addition, both the six-month andthe long-term follow-up questionnaire results support Pahnke's hypothesis thatthe subjects who received psilocybin, more so than the controls, experiencedsubstantial positive persisting effects in attitude and behavior.THE LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS: GENERAL OVERVIEWThis long-term follow-up was conducted roughly a quarter century after thesubjects participated in the original experiment. All subjects contacted live inthe United States, with five out of the eight psilocybin subjects and five outof the ten placebo subjects currently working as ministers. Other professionsrepresented are stockbroker, lawyer, community developer, social worker,administrative assistant, and educator. Except for one of the psilocybinsubjects, all are currently married. All are working and self-supporting. Allbut two welcomed the opportunity to discuss their participation in the GoodFriday experiment.Each of the psilocybin subjects had vivid memories of portions of their GoodFriday experience. For most, this was their life's only psychedelic experience,in part because there have been no legal opportunities for such experiences forthe last twenty-five years in the United States (or in any of the roughly 90countries who are party to the international drug control treaties coordinatedby the United Nation's World Health Organization). The experimental subjectsunanimously described their Good Friday psilocybin experience as having hadelements of a genuinely mystical nature and characterized it as one of the highpoints of their spiritual life. Some subjects reported that the content of theirexperience was specifically involved with the life of Christ and relateddirectly to the Christian message, while others had experiences of a moreuniversal, nonspecific nature. Most of the control subjects could barelyremember even a few details of the service.Most of the psilocybin subjects had subsequent experiences of a mystical naturewith which they were able to compare and contrast to their psilocybinexperience. These subsequent experiences occurred either in dreams, in prayerlife, in nature, or with other psychedelics and seemed to the psilocybinsubjects to be of the same essential nature as their Good Friday experience.Significant differences between their nondrug and drug mystical experiences werenoted, with the drug experiences reportedly both more intense and composed of awider emotional range than the nondrug experiences. The nondrug experiences werecomposed primarily of peaceful, beautiful moments experienced with ease, whilethe drug experiences tended to include moments of great fear, agony, andself-doubt.The discussion of Subject T.B. about the relationship between his psilocybin andhis other mystical experiences illustrates how the subjects saw the validity oftheir psilocybin experiences:I can think of no experiences [like the Good Friday experience] quite of thatmagnitude. That was the last of the great four in my life. The dream state . . .I had no control over when it was coming. It was when I [was about nine and] hadscarlet fever and rheumatic fever, apparently at either similar or at the sametimes. And they thought that I was going to die. And I saw a light coming out ofthe sky, this is the dream, and it came toward me and it was like the figure ofChrist and I said, “No, let me live and I'll serve you.” And I'm alive and I'veserved. The prayer state when I was in seventh grade was very similar in the wayit happened to me. I intentionally went for an experience with God. In seventhgrade. And I also went for an experience with God at the Good Friday experience.And those were similar. The West Point experience was different. In that yes, itwas prayers, it was on my knees, it was there, but the face of Christ was . . .it happened more to me than me participating in it. It was more like a savingexperience kind of thing. So I've had that and can talk about “a salvationexperience,” a born again experience, it was that kind of dedication.Each of the psilocybin subjects felt that the experience had significantlyaffected his life in a positive way and expressed appreciation for havingparticipated in the experiment. Most of the effects discussed in the long-termfollow-up interviews centered around enhanced appreciation of life and ofnature, deepened sense of joy, deepened commitment to the Christian ministry orto whatever other vocations the subjects chose, enhanced appreciation of unusualexperiences and emotions, increased tolerance of other religious systems,deepened equanimity in the face of difficult life crises, and greater solidarityand identification with foreign peoples, minorities, women, and nature. SubjectK.B.'s description of the long-term effects is representative. He remarks:It left me with a completely unquestioned certainty that there is an environmentbigger than the one I'm conscious of. I have my own interpretation of what thatis, but it went from a theoretical proposition to an experimental one. In onesense it didn't change anything. I didn't discover something I hadn't dreamedof, but what I had thought on the basis of reading and teaching was there. Iknew it. Somehow it was much more real to me. . . . I expect things frommeditation and prayer and so forth that I might have been a bit more skepticalabout before. . . . I have gotten help with problems, and at times I thinkdirection and guidance in problem solving. Somehow my life has been differentknowing that there is something out there. . . . What I saw wasn't anythingentirely surprising and yet there was a powerful impact from having seen it.In addition to self-reports, several subjects who had stayed in contact witheach other over the years spoke about the effects they noticed in each other. Inthe instances where such information was obtained, the observations of fellowsubjects were similar to the self-reports and confirmed claims of beneficialeffects.Several of the psilocybin subjects discussed their deepened involvement in thepolitics of the day as one result of their Good Friday experience. Feelings ofunity led many of the subjects to identify with and feel compassion forminorities, women, and the environment. The feelings of timelessness andeternity reduced their fear of death and empowered the subjects to take morerisks in their lives and to participate more fully in political struggles.Subject T.B. discussed how his perception of death during the Good Fridayexperience affected his work in the political field. He remarked:When you get a clear vision of what [death] is and have sort of been there, andhave left the self, left the body, you know, self leaving the body, or soulleaving the body, or whatever you want to call it, you would also know thatmarching in the Civil Rights Movement or against the Vietnam War in Washington[is less fearful]. . . . In a sense [it takes away the fear of dying] . . .because you've already been there. You know what it's about. When peopleapproaching death have an out-of-body experience . . . [you] say, “I know whatyou're talking about. I've been there. Been there and come back. And it's notterrifying, it doesn't hurt. . . .”Subject S.J. found that his Good Friday experience of unity supported hisefforts in the political field:I got very involved with civil rights after that [his psychedelic experience]and spent some time in the South. I remember this unity business. I thoughtthere was some link there. . . . There could have been. People certainly don'twrite about it. They write about it the opposite way, that drugs are an escapefrom social obligations. That is the popular view. . . .Only one of the control subjects felt that his experience of the Good Fridayservice resulted in beneficial personal growth. That particular control subjectthought he was probably the one in the original experiment reported to have hada partial mystical experience. Ironically, he felt that the most importantbenefit he received from the service was the decision to try psychedelics at theearliest opportunity. The Good Friday service had that same effect on oneanother placebo subject, who also had a subsequent psychedelic experience.The actual experiences of the original psilocybin subjects are best communicatedby quoting from the transcripts of the long-term follow-up interviews. Rev. S.J.had an experience almost uniformly positive. He described his experience asfollows:Something extraordinary had taken place which had never taken place before. Allof the sudden I felt sort of drawn out into infinity, and all of the sudden Ihad lost touch with my mind. I felt that I was caught up in the vastness ofCreation . . . huge, as the mystics say. . . . I did experience that kind ofclassic kind of blending. . . . Sometimes you would look up and see the light onthe alter and it would just be a blinding sort of light and radiation. . . . Themain thing about it was a sense of timelessness.The meditation was going on all during this time, and he [Rev. Howard Thurman]would say things about Jesus and you would have this overwhelming feeling ofJesus. . . . It was like you totally penetrated what was being said and itpenetrated you. . . . Death looked different. It became in focus. . . . I gotthe impression, the sensation . . . that what people are essentially in theiressence that somehow they would continue to live. They may die in one sense, thephysical sense, but their being in heaven would survive. . . .We took such an infinitesimal amount of psilocybin, and yet it connected me toinfinity.Subject L.J. confronted the issue of personal mortality, which he described asfollows:I was on the floor underneath the chapel pew and he [a group leader] was lookingafter me and sort of aware of, you know, “L.J. is down there, is everything allright?” I was hearing my uncle who had died [several months before], the one whowas a minister, saying, “I want you to die, I want you to die, I want you todie” I could hear his voice saying. The more that I let go and sort of died, themore I felt this eternal life, saying to myself under my breath perhaps, “it hasalways been this way, it has always been this way. . . . O, isn't it wonderful,there's nothing to fear, this is what it means to die, or to taste of eternallife. . . .” And the more I died the more I appropriated this sense of eternallife. . . . While the service went on I was caught up in this experience ofeternal life and appreciating what the peyote Indians or the sacred mushroomIndians experienced with their imbibing of the drug. Just in that one session Ithink I gained experience I didn't have before and probably could never havegotten from a hundred hours of reading or a thousand hours of reading.I would have to say as far as I'm concerned it was a positive, mysticalexperience . . . confirmed by experiences both before and after.Rev. L.R. had one of the most difficult experiences of all the psilocybinsubjects. He described the early portion of his experience as follows:Shortly after receiving the capsule, all of a sudden I just wanted to laugh. Ibegan to go into a very strong paranoid experience. And I found it to be scary.The chapel was dark and I hated it in there, just absolutely hated it in there.And I got up and left. I walked down the corridor and there was a guard, aperson stationed at the door so individuals wouldn't go out, and he says, “Don'tgo outside,” and I said, “Oh no, I won't. I'll just look outdoors.” And I wentto the door and out I went. They sent [a group leader] out after me. We [L.R.and the group leader] went back into the building and again, I hated to be inthat building and being confined because there were bars on the window and Ifelt literally like I was in prison. One of the things that was probablyhappening to me was a reluctance to just flow. I tried to resist that and assoon as resistance sets in there's likely to be conflict and there's likely, Ithink, for there to be anxiety.In addition to his emotion struggles, Rev. L.R. discusses the mystical aspect ofhis experience as follows:The inner awareness and feelings I had during the drug experience were thedropping away of the external world and those relationships and then the suddensense of singleness, oneness. And the rest of normal waking consciousness isreally . . . illusion. It's not real and somehow that inner core experience ofoneness is more real and more authentic than normal consciousness. . . . I wasalso experiencing some of those same kind of states that produced anxiety, and Iwanted to try to get at the bottom of it.I personally feel that the experience itself was, and I know [Pahnke's] researchcame to the conclusion, that the effect of the chemicals like that is verysimilar, parallel to, perhaps the same as a classical mystical experience. . . .Rev. Y.M. described his experience, which also had some difficult moments, asfollows:I closed my eyes and the visuals were back, the color patterns were back, and itwas as if I was in an ocean of bands, streams of color, streaming past me. Thecolors were brilliant and I could swim down any one of those colors. Then thatswirl dissolved itself into a radial pattern, a center margin radial patternwith the colors going out from the center. I was at the center and I could swimout any one of those colors and it would be a whole different life's experience.I could swim out any one of them that I wanted. I mean I could swimmetaphorically. There wasn't the sense that I could actually paddle. I couldchoose any one I wanted, but I had to choose one.I couldn't decide which one to go out, and eventually it connects to thedecision I was in the midst of making about career choices . . . when I couldn'tdecide, I died. Very existential . . . for a brief moment there, I wasphysically dying. My insides were literally being scooped out, and it was verypainful. . . . I said to myself . . . that nobody should have to go through this. . . it was excruciating to die like that. Very painful. And I died. . . .After the psilocybin experience, I never consciously made the choice as to whatI was going to do career-wise, but the choice was made. It was made while I wason the psilocybin. But it never had to be consciously, intentionally, “Ah, let'ssee, what I am going to do is. . . .” It was made, and I was confident of it, itwas going to be. And I did it afterwards. . . .Rev. K.B. described his mystical experience in the following manner:I feel almost whatever I say about it . . . is a little bit artificial in termsof describing. What it is is something deeper and probably also more obvious andI think I endeavor to put it into some kind of category which may obscure thepoint in some way. I remember feeling at the time that I was very unusuallyincapable of describing it. Words are a familiar environment for me and Iusually can think of them, but I didn't find any for this. And I haven't yet.I closed my eyes, either thinking of meditating or maybe I was drowsy orsomething. I closed my eyes and it seemed to be darker than usual. And thenthere was a sudden bolt of light which I think was entirely internal and afeeling almost like a shock or something and that was only for an instant. Itwas violent but it was a definite tingling like taking hold of a wire orsomething.I closed my eyes and . . . thought that this would be a fine time for[meditating on the Passion]. . . . So I did think about the procession to thecross. And with my eyes closed I had an unusually vivid scene of the processiongoing by. A scene quite apart from any imagining or anything on my part. Aself-actualizing thing—kind of like watching a movie or something, it was apartfrom me but very vivid.I had a definite sense of being an infant or being born, or something like that.I had a sense of death, too, but I think actually the sense of death came afterthe sense of birth. . . . I had my hands on my legs and there wasn't any flesh,there were bare bones, resting on my bones. That part wasn't frightening, I wasjust kind of amazed. . . . I think I must have gone along through the life ofChrist identifying in a very total sort of way—reliving the life in some wayuntil finally dying and going into the tomb.I really am glad I took it. And glad that I was a subject. I don't think itwould be a particularly memorable experience if I just had listened to theservice. I've heard some good services and I imagine this was as moving as most.But I think it would be in that category instead of a once-in-a-lifetime sort ofthing. . . .I've remained convinced that my ability to perceive things was artificiallychanged, but the perceptions I had were real as anything else.Subject T.B. was very comfortable with the effects of the psilocybin, perhapsbecause he had had mystical experiences prior to the experiment. He describedhis experience in the following way:I was kneeling there praying and beginning to feel like I was in the seventhgrade, eleven or twelve years old. It was the kind of experiences that you knewthat something great was happening. I started to go to the root of all being.And discovered that . . . you never quite get there. That was my discoveryduring that time . . . it's a philosophy and a theology that I hold yet today.You can approach the fullness of all being in either prayer, or in thepsilocybin experience. You can reach out, but you can't dive down . . . and hitthat root.The discovery within that experience is that you could approach God by twodifferent ways. You either get to the root, the ground of all being, or thefullness of all being. And in getting to the root, you'll strive, you'll comecloser and closer, but it's always half, and you'll think another half step,another half step, and you'll never quite get there. The fullness, to approachthe fullness of God is the only way to approach God.Subject H.R. told of his largely positive experience in the following way:It was a feeling of being . . . lifted out of your present state. I just stoppedworrying about time and all that kind of stuff . . . there was one universalman, personhood, whatever you want to call it . . . a lot of connectedness witheverybody and everything. I don't think Christ or other religious images that Ican remember came into it. That's the only reason I didn't think it wasreligious. I don't remember any religious images. . . .I was convinced after the experiment that I had had quite an experience but thatit was really into my psychological depths, and it was not a religiousexperience. . . . It was really the sense that I was discovering the depths ofmy own self. It did not have a sacredness kind of element to it. . . . I didn'tthink I had experienced a God that was particularly outside of me. What Iexperienced was a God that was inside of me. And I think that . . . made me say,I don't think this is religious, I think this is psychological. But that wasbecause of the way I was defining being . . . the way I thought God was beingdefined by other people at that point.After the Good Friday experiment, two out of the ten placebo subjectsexperienced psychedelics. Placebo Subject P.J. described his first psychedelicexperience, which took place in a chapel with psilocybin Subject L.R. as hisguide, as follows:I laid on the front pew and watched myself—it seemed like eternity—pour throughmy navel and totally become nothing. And I felt that this would never stop. Itseemed like an eternity of being in heaven and everything. One of the mostbeautiful experiences in my entire life.It sure kicks the hell out of one being rigid with what could go on and whatkind of experiences you could have. To take one of these drugs says a lot morecan happen than what's been happening in your total experience. And I thinkthat's good, and that's why I would want my kids to take it.Placebo Subject L.G. received psilocybin in a hospital as a part of a subsequentexperiment conducted by Pahnke (1966) in a fruitless search for a placebosubstance which would permit a successful double-blind experiment. L.G.described his experience as follows:It was rather removed from the religious context. Certainly the environment wewere in had no particular religious symbols. I recall they really stressed [theneed to] be absolutely open and just relax and flow with the experience whatevercomes. So, there was no context really to suggest a particular experience likethere might have been with the Good Friday experiment. We didn't talk about themysticism, as I recall, or religious symbols. . . .At one point I kind of felt like, “Well, maybe this is what it is like to becrazy.” I never really panicked but I was acutely aware of anxiety. . . . Astime evolved I just had this incredible sense of joy and humor, too. I waslaughing, real ecstasy. . . . The thing that struck me was how anybody couldworry or not trust, that just struck me as an absurdity. It was very exciting.There was an energy, it was almost a sexual thing, an intensity and a joy. Thevisual things that I experienced and the music, I think were aligned with thesense of unity, everything was unified. We were all part of the same thing. Youdidn't sense a difference between the music or the physical objects. . . .I think that you can certainly have a religious experience without the religioussymbols. Certainly the religious symbols can lead you to a mystical experience.Unfortunately, they can also be divisive. The sectarianism can flow from thedifferent symbols and justify the differences rather than the commonality. Ithink the mystic experience as I understand it comes down more on the commons.Contrasting with the desire of two of the control subjects to have their ownpsychedelic experience, several of the remaining control subjects decided duringthe course of the experiment that they had no desire to try psychedelics. Thebehavior of some of their fellow subjects who received psilocybin had frightenedthem. Placebo Subject B.A. remarked:I tend to look back on it as an historical curiosity, with intellectual interestto me, but you know, frankly not much else at this point. . . . The only changethat I can think of that it brought about in my life was a conviction that Inever wanted to go on a drug trip of any type ever. And I never have, except forbooze. The sights I saw [during the experiment] were very disturbing to me, andI didn't see myself wanting to be in that kind of position. It appeared to behopelessly out of control and life threatening in several instances.The remaining control subjects viewed psilocybin with some equanimity but werenot motivated enough to seek out their own experience. If the circumstances wereright and the substances were legal, several indicated that they might bewilling to participate in another experiment.A SIGNIFICANT OMISSIONOut of the seven psilocybin subjects formally interviewed, only two had had GoodFriday experiences that they reported to be completely positive withoutsignificant psychic struggles. The others all felt moments in which they fearedthey were either going crazy, dying, or were too weak for the ordeal they wereexperiencing. These struggles were resolved during the course of the Good Fridayservice and according to the subjects contributed to their learning and growth.It appears that these difficult moments were significantly underemphasized inPahnke's thesis and in the subsequent reporting on the experiment. PsilocybinSubject H.R. stated:The other thing I found unique that wasn't talked at all about in what I read,at least in the thesis, was that it was all on the positive up side. I don'tknow whether other people have said this but I had a down side. . . . It was aroller coaster. . . . I mean I had a very strong positive sense of the whole . .. one with humanity kind of positive glowing, unity kind of feeling and then Iwent down to the bottom where I was really just . . . guilt . . . that's all Ican say. It was a very, very profound sense of guilt.Pahnke does mention that two of the subjects who received the psilocybin “had alittle difficulty in readjusting to the ‘ordinary world’ and needed specialreassurance by their group leaders until the drug effects subsided” (Pahnke,1963, p. 219). Almost certainly, one of those subjects was L.R., who found thechapel to be like a prison and went outside for much of the service. The othersubject is, almost certainly, the one who refused to participate in thefollow-up study.In one technical section of the thesis, and in none of his subsequent papers,Pahnke mentions that one of those two subjects later referred to his experienceas “a psychotic episode” (Pahnke, 1963, p. 232). In another part of the thesis,Pahnke mentions that injectable thorazine was on hand for emergencies. What hedoes not report anywhere is that one subject was actually given a shot ofthorazine as a tranquilizer during the course of the experiment. Several of thesubjects and group leaders remembered this incident and reported in thelong-term follow-up interviews that it involved the one psilocybin subject whorefused to be interviewed by the author. Needless to say, this occurrence shouldsurely have been mentioned in Pahnke's thesis and, by those few who knew thatsuch an event had actually transpired, in any subsequent reporting on theexperiment.Pahnke probably did not report his use of the tranquilizer because he wasfearful of adding to the ammunition of the opponents of the research. Fears thatnegative aspects of the experiment would be taken out of context and exaggeratedmay have been justified. In an example of just such a critique, Zaehner assertsin his book, Zen, Drugs, and Mysticism, that Pahnke, in an article Pahnkepublished several years after the Good Friday experiment, repudiated the resultsof his own study (Zaehner, 1972, p. 105). In that article, Pahnke does indeedsay that mystical experiences were absent (Pahnke, 1967, p. 71). Pahnke was,however, referring to the control of subjects. This misreading of Pahnke byZaehner is an indication of how, even in an educated scholar, bias can overwhelmfacts. This observation, of course, is also true of Pahnke. His silence abouthis administration of a tranquilizer may perhaps have been good politics;certainly it was bad science.Although an interview with the subject who was tranquilized would be necessaryto understand the subtleties of his experience and its consequences, severallong-term follow-up interviews generated secondhand information which may besummarized as follows: This subject was reported to be deeply moved by a sermondelivered by the very dynamic preacher who emphasized that it was the obligationof all Christians to tell people that there was a man on the cross. This subjectwas reported to have gone outside of the chapel possibly intending to follow theexhortation.A struggle ensued when the group leaders, worried for his safety, tried to bringhim back inside. After a time during which he seemed fearful and was notsettling down, Pahnke tranquilized him with a shot of thorazine. He was thenbrought back into the chapel and remained calm for the duration of theexperiment. He participated in all further aspects of the experiment and in thesix-month follow-up reported that he considered his fear experience “slightlyharmful” because “in a mob panic-situation I feel I would be less likely tomaintain a calm objective position than I might have formerly” (Pahnke, 1963, p.232).Subsequent to the Good Friday experiment, the use of tranquilizers in controlledpsychedelic psychotherapy research was largely abandoned in favor of simplyproviding a supportive environment and letting the drug run its course (RichardYensen, personal communication, 1991).DISCUSSIONThe original Good Friday experiment is one of the preeminent psychedelicexperiments in the scientific literature. Despite the methodologicalshortcomings of the unavoidable failure of the double-blind and the use ofseveral imprecise questions in the questionnaire used to quantify mysticalexperiences, the experiment's fascinating and provocative conclusions stronglysupport the hypothesis that psychedelic drugs can help facilitate mysticalexperiences when used by religiously inclined people in a religious setting. Theoriginal experiment also supports the hypothesis that those psilocybin subjectswho experienced a full or a partial mystical experience would, after six months,report a substantial amount of positive, and virtually no negative, persistingchanges in attitude and behavior.This long-term follow-up, conducted twenty-four to twenty-seven years after theoriginal experiment, provides further support to the findings of the originalexperiment. All psilocybin subjects participating in the long-term follow-up,but none of the controls, still considered their original experience to have hadgenuinely mystical elements and to have made a uniquely valuable contribution totheir spiritual lives. The positive changes described by the psilocybin subjectsat six months, which in some cases involved basic vocational and value choicesand spiritual understandings, had persisted over time and in some cases haddeepened. The overwhelmingly positive nature of the reports of the psilocybinsubjects are even more remarkable because this long-term follow-up took placeduring a period of time in the United States when drug abuse was becoming thepublic's number-one social concern, with all the attendant social pressure todeny the value of drug-induced experiences. The long-term follow-up interviewscast considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed bydrugs are in any way inferior to nondrug mystical experiences in both theirimmediate content and longterm positive effects, a critique of the Good Fridayexperiment advanced primarily by Zaehner (Bakalar, 1985).Unexpectedly, the long-term follow-up also uncovered data that should have beenreported in the original thesis. Pahnke failed to report the administration ofthe tranquilizer thorazine to one of the subjects who received psilocybin. Thereis no justification for this omission no matter how unfairly the critics of thisresearch may have used the information and no matter how minimal were thenegative persisting effects reported by the subject. In addition, Pahnkeunderemphasized the difficult psychological struggles experienced by most of thepsilocybin subjects. These very serious omissions point to an importantincompleteness in Pahnke's interpretation of the effects of psilocybin.Some of the backlash that swept the psychedelics out of the research labs andout of the hands of physicians and therapists can be traced in part to thethousands of cases of people who took psychedelics in non-research settings,were unprepared for the frightening aspects of their psychedelic experiences,and ended up in hospital emergency rooms. These unfortunate instances of panicreaction have many causes, yet some of them stem from the way in which thecautionary elements of the Good Friday experiment were inadequately discussed inPahnke's thesis, in subsequent scholarly reports, and in the popular media. Forexample, Time magazine reported on the experiment in glowing, exaggerated termsstating, “All students who had taken the drug [psilocybin] experienced amystical consciousness that resembled those described by saints and ascetics”(9/23, 1966, p. 62).The widespread use of psychedelics, both in medical and nonmedical settings,which began in the 1960s, is still currently taking place, apparently largelyunderground. Such use was partially founded upon an optimism regarding theinherent safety of the psychedelic experience which did not fully acknowledgethe complexity and profundity of the psychological issues associated withpsychedelic experiences. With some proponents of psychedelics exaggerating thebenefits and minimizing the risks, a backlash against these substances waspredictable. With the intriguing connection reported by several psilocybinsubjects between mystical experiences and political action, the backlash inretrospect may have been inevitable (Baumeister & Placidi, 1985).Despite the difficult moments several of the psilocybin subjects passed through,the subjects who participated in the long-term follow-up reported a substantialamount of persisting positive effects and no significant longterm negativeeffects. Even the subject who was tranquilized in the original experimentreported only “slightly harmful” negative persisting effects at the six-monthfollow-up. Secondhand information gathered during the course of the long-termfollow-up suggests that his experience caused no persisting dysfunction and mayeven have had some beneficial as well as detrimental effects.The lack of long-term negative effects or dysfunction is not surprising.Strassman's literature review of all controlled scientific experiments usingpsychedelics in human volunteers found that panic reactions and adversereactions were extremely rare. He concluded that the potential risks of futureresearch were outweighed by the potential benefits (Strassman, 1984).This long-term follow-up study, even in light of the new data about thedifficulties of the psychedelic experiences of many of the subjects, addsfurther support to the conclusion that additional studies are justified. Futureexperiments should be approached cautiously and carefully, with amultidisciplinary team of scientists involved in planning and implementation.Such a team should include psychiatrists, psychologists, religious professionalsfrom a variety of traditions, as well as drug abuse prevention, education, andtreatment officials. Questions as fundamental as those raised by the Good Fridayexperiment deserve to be addressed by the scientific community and post specialchallenges to the regulatory agencies. Renewed research can be expected torequire patience, courage, and wisdom from all concerned.REFERENCESBAKALAR, J. (1985). Social and intellectual attitudes toward drug-inducedreligious experience. J.

At night, his body temperature would drop and he'dstart to tremble. During the day, he was jumpy. He was always looking around,always on edge. His vibe scared the people around him. He couldn't hang on to ajob. He started drinking and drugging, anything to numb out.Years passed before a counselor with the Veterans Administration told him he hadsevere posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The former Marine had spent theearly 1990s interrogating prisoners in Kuwait. Years later, he was still playingout the first Persian Gulf War.Counseling helped a little, but the symptoms continued. He went to rehab for hissubstance abuse, then tried Alcoholics Anonymous. “That went on for ten years,”he said. “I don't know how many times I hit rock bottom.”Then one of his Seattle neighbors—a woman who also suffered from PTSD—told himabout a group of veterans who were going down to Peru to try a psychedelic drugcalled Ayahuasca, a jungle vine that is brewed into a tea. Indigenous Peruvianscalled it “sacred medicine.” A wealthy veteran had started a healing center inSouth America and would pay all Ric's expenses.The next thing Ric knew, he was crawling into a tent on a platform out in themiddle of the Amazon jungle. The sun went down. The shaman gave him the tea, ablessing, and a pail in which to vomit.“Your body will not keep it in you,” Ric recalled. “At first, it's the worstthing you've ever done in your life. Then all of a sudden, you blink your eyesand you are not there anymore. You get out of your body and look back and seewhat is wrong with you. I saw the shell of the person I didn't want to be andstepped out of it. It was the most amazing thing. I've taken lots of drugsbefore, but I never remembered. I think this is the key. You actually gainknowledge from this. I don't even consider it a drug. It's an eye-opener. Itmakes you think about stuff. Your deepest darkest secrets, stuff you have beenholding on to since you were eight years old. It washes out of you, and you feellike a totally different person. People look at you differently. Your wholeworld changes before your eyes.”Three years later, Ric Godfrey says he hasn't had a single symptom of the shakesor night terrors since he came back from the jungle. He's relaxed and holdingdown a great job.“I've always been afraid that someone was out to get me, but I don't have thatfear anymore,” he says. “I still like to sit with my back to the wall. I stillhave certain military idiosyncrasies, but I'm not afraid anymore.”Psychedelic drugs are back. Not that they ever really went away. You couldalways find them on the street, in the psychedelic underground, and along themore enlightened edges of the drug culture. What's new is that these powerful,mind-altering substances are finally coming out of the drug counterculture andinto the mainstream laboratories of some of the world's leading universities andmedical centers. Research projects and pilot studies at Johns Hopkins, Harvard,Purdue University, and the University of California at Los Angeles are probingtheir mind-altering mysteries and healing powers. Psychedelic drugs likepsilocybin and ecstasy are still illegal for street use and cannot be legallyprescribed by doctors, but university administrators, government regulatoryagencies, and private donors are suddenly giving the stamp of approval and themoney needed for new research into beneficial uses for this “sacred medicine.”“This field of research is finally coming of age,” said David Nichols, a veteranresearcher who recently retired professor from the Purdue University College ofPharmacy and the Indiana University School of Medicine. “As Crosby, Stills andNash said, it's been a long time coming.”Mainstream America's panic over psychedelics began after experiments at Harvardin the 1960s by notorious psychologists Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert spunout of control. What began as the Harvard Psilocybin Project morphed into acrusade to turn America on to the wonders of LSD. The researchers wereeventually removed from the school's faculty, and Leary served jail time formarijuana. “Timothy Leary played a very significant role in the backlash,” saidRoland Griffiths, a professor in the departments of psychiatry and neurosciencesat Johns Hopkins, who has emerged as one of the leaders in the new wave ofresearch into the beneficial use of psychedelic drugs. “Leary was an iconicfigure at the time, but he modeled the wrong outcome by departing fromscientific method. He had a lot of interesting things to say about it but didn'tpursue a systematic and cautious experimental approach.”The excesses weren't limited to Harvard. “Out on the West Coast we had the AcidTests (of Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters) and all that—parties wherepsychedelic beverages were distributed,” said Charles Grob, a professor ofpsychiatry and pediatrics at UCLA who has studied Ayahuasca rites in Peru andled research with psilocybin and cancer patients. “The culture was not preparedto handle these compounds.”The 1970 Controlled Substances Act reclassified common hallucinogens as schedule1 drugs, meaning they were considered easy to abuse and had no legitimatemedical use. New limitations were placed on human research, and federal fundingdisappeared.But the times they are a-changin'. There's a new openness to the medicinal useof marijuana. In the November 2012 elections, the states of Washington andColorado legalized the recreational use of pot. Baby boomers who came of age inthe psychedelic sixties and seventies are now running government agencies anduniversity administrations.Leading the campaign in the new wave of government-sanctioned research is theMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), an independentnonprofit which has raised millions of dollars to fund an ongoing study into theuse of MDMA, also known as “ecstasy,” to treat returning war veterans and rapesurvivors suffering from PTSD.In the first phase of that study, MAPS researcher Michael Mithoefer, apsychiatrist from South Carolina, treated twenty-one patients. Some of theparticipants were given MDMA with psychotherapy, while some got a placebo alongwith their therapy. Researchers hoped to show that MDMA's ability to enhancetrust, empathy, and openness would make it easier for patients to recount atraumatic event. It did. Over 80 percent of those who received MDMA had no PTSDsymptoms two months later, compared to only around 25 percent of those who gotthe placebo. Patients with MDMA-assisted therapy did better than those treatedwith traditional prescription drugs, such as Zoloft or Paxil.In September 2012, Mithoefer and his colleagues released more results in a paperpublished in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. It showed that the benefits ofMDMA-assisted psychotherapy were sustained over an average of three and a halfyears since the last time the drug had been ingested, an exceptionally lengthyperiod for a follow-up study. Furthermore, there were no reports of lastingharmful effects from exposure to the drug.Rick Doblin, the executive director of MAPS, envisions his organization as asustainable nonprofit that will train therapists, run its own clinics, anddistribute ecstasy to doctors and psychologists.MAPS controls 960 grams of ecstasy that was legally manufactured in 1985 byNichols, the Purdue University chemist. That's enough for between four and fivethousand doses, and it has not lost its potency. “It's still the world's purestMDMA,” Doblin said.The use of psychedelic drugs for therapeutic purposes is not withoutcontroversy.In the 1950s, writer Aldous Huxley warned that psychedelics can take users to“heaven or hell”—for some, a path to enlightenment; for others, the spark forpsychosis.Huston Smith, the scholar of world religions who was another early explorer,noted the drugs can mimic “authentic religious experience” but questionedwhether altered states of consciousness actually change the way people livetheir lives.Smith also issued early warnings that today's “Ayahuasca tourists” mightconsider. While “sacred medicine” may be helpful for a child or young adultraised in Native American religious culture, it may prove disastrous for anoutsider unprepared for a mind-blowing trip. “History shows that minority faithsare viable, but only when they are cradled in communities that are solid andstructured enough to constitute what are in effect churches,” Huston writes inan essay titled “Psychedelic Theophanies and the Religious Life.” More recently,the dangers of using psychedelics without medical supervision were illustratedwhen a man died after ingesting Ayahuasca at the same Peruvian retreat centerwhere Ric Godfrey had his life-changing experience with the drug.Doblin and other advocates of psychedelic-assisted therapy acknowledge thatthese powerful substances—while not as addictive as drugs like alcohol, heroin,or cocaine—can be abused by recreational users. They propose a system wherebythe substances can be prescribed by doctors and administered by trainedtherapists.Nevertheless, researchers and advocates argue that psychedelic drugs, used withclose supervision, hold great promise for a deeper understanding of theconnection between the brain and human consciousness.“Where does our capacity for consciousness come from?” asked David Presti, whoteaches graduate and undergraduate courses in neuroscience at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley. “It's still a huge mystery. It's the biggest mystery ofall in science, and psychedelics are the most powerful probe to study thatconnection.”In an interview in his office in the Life Sciences Building on the Berkeleycampus, Presti held up a large piece of dried Ayahuasca vine. He said brainscientists are confirming what shamanic cultures around the world have known formillennia. “These substances have a profound capacity, when used underappropriate conditions, to be catalysts for real transformation in people, forreal healing.”A Johns Hopkins study of psilocybin and mystical experience is a good example.Follow-up surveys of thirty-six “hallucinogen-naive adults” who took psilocybinunder Griffiths's supervision found that two-thirds of them rated the sessionsas being “among the five most spiritually significant experiences of theirlives.”Griffiths's work on the behavioral and subjective effects of moodaltering drugshas been largely supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.Along with Grob, he has studied the effects of psilocybin to treat anxiety incancer patients—their research found that low doses of psilocybin improvedpatients' mood and reduced their need for narcotic pain relievers—and has beguna new pilot study to see if the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms” can helppeople overcome their addiction to tobacco.Griffiths's personal interest in meditation inspired his study ofpsilocybin-occasioned mystical experience in healthy volunteers. One researchsubject, Brian, who asked that his last name not be used, recalled, “I wasunified with everything. I still had enough awareness to get up and walk to thebathroom, but everything was so incredibly beautiful that I laughed and cried atthe same time. I was one with it. It was just incredible—one of the top fiveexperiences I have ever had in my life.”The experience was so spiritually profound that Brian recommitted himself to hisstudy of meditation and Buddhism, and in late 2012 was scheduled to be ordainedas a monk in the Soto Zen tradition.For Presti, outcomes like Brian's are not surprising. “One of the wayspsychedelics work is by reducing our psychological defenses. They allow theperson to become aware of uncomfortable feelings and thoughts so they can cometo the surface and be therapeutically processed,” he said. “Nobody knows exactlyhow these things work, but there may be some kind of hard rewiring that goes onin the brain. They may increase neuroplasticity—make the neurons moresusceptible to forming new connections.”He believes the substances should also be studied as a possible treatment fordepression. “But there is a lot of resistance to this from the pharmaceuticalindustry. The last thing it wants to see is a substance people only use once ortwice. They want us to use something every day for the rest of our life. That'show they make money.”Other researchers are troubled that the new wave of psychedelic research isblurring the lines between spiritual experience and the hard science ofmedicine. “We are not purveyors of spirituality. Having an epiphany is not apart of medicine,” said John Mendelson, a senior scientist at the CaliforniaPacific Medical Research Center in San Francisco. “Most of medicine is notpredicated on making you better than you are. It's getting you back to where youwere. There are lots of people and things out there [that] can make us feelbetter, but our job is to diagnose and treat and fix diseases.” But that view isno longer going unchallenged.At the same time, a new generation of dedicated psychedelic drug researchers hasemerged on university campuses across the nation. Many of them gathered lastSeptember at a “Psychedemia” conference at the University of Pennsylvania inPhiladelphia. They see their mission as “integrating psychedelics in academia.”“Psychedelic studies are entering the mainstream,” said Neşe Devenot, younggraduate student at Penn and a lead organizer of the multidisciplinaryconference. “You can talk about this now at the dinner table without comingacross as some kind of fanatic.”During a lunch break at the weekend conference, one of the wise elders in thefield of psychedelic drug research, psychologist William A. Richards, sat in thecafeteria in the basement of Houston Hall, surveying the buzz ofintergenerational excitement. Richards, who is nearing the end of a long careerat Johns Hopkins, has been exploring these realms since the early 1960s withsuch luminaries as Stanislav Grof, Abraham Maslow, Walter Pahnke, and yes,Timothy Leary.Richards knows there could be another backlash against psychedelic drugresearch, not just by those who are still fighting the “war on drugs” but alsoby academics who resist the idea that scholars should seriously study somethingas slippery as “spirituality.”“But if mysticism is to emerge from silent monastic cells into the bright lightof scientific discourse, I see no alternative,” Richards said. “We have arrivedat that frontier where the growing edge of true science meets the mystery of theunknown. Here, faith takes over—either belief in something or belief in nothing.These experiences are not in any drug. They are in us.”Like Ric Godfrey, Judith Goedeke needed a way to heal.Judith helped others through her work as an acupuncturist. She'd always takencare of her own body. Then she was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2003.“How has this happened to me?” she asked herself. “I was just obsessing overthat question. I did not do the things that assault the kidney in my adultlife.” Then she thought of another possibility. “In my younger years I went avery long time in fear. My house was not a safe place, and I know from my workwith Chinese medicine that fear does assault the kidney.”Judith had her left kidney removed. “By its removal, I am removing decades oftrauma,” she told herself. “I would see it then as a really deep healing, and Icould live with that.”Over the next five years, she had three CAT scans a year. There was noindication of further disease, and she was released from the care of heroncologist.A couple years later, Judith heard about a study at Johns Hopkins UniversitySchool of Medicine in Baltimore, under researcher Roland Griffiths. Patientswith life-threatening illnesses were being treated with psilocybin, asynthesized version of the drug found in “magic mushrooms,” to help them dealwith the psychological trauma of a cancer diagnosis.“At first, I couldn't see myself doing this,” she recalled. “I am a cancersurvivor. I have tremendous respect for my body and am very careful.”Judith decided to enter the study after she got to know two staff members withthe project who would guide her through the process. “They are very solid andgenerous, deeply spiritual, good people. I had a tremendous amount of trust ineveryone I encountered who was part of the program.”She was led through two psychedelic sessions, one with a low dose and one with ahigh dose. She saw what seemed like the ornate work of a great medievalcathedral, patterns that would rapidly change color and texture. There wereother hallucinations of strange, garish creatures—like something out of acarnival. They annoyed her, and scared her a bit.“I said silently, ‘Okay. Here's the deal. If I give myself over to you, will Iget myself back in at least the same shape?’ And what I heard was a voice thatsaid, ‘Do you think I would disrespect my own handiwork?’”Three years later, Judith Goedeke felt that the session helped her to finallyheal her decades-old trauma. “It was out of my brokenness that the disease gothold of me,” she said. “So it helped me heal my life in a way that years oftherapy and years of acupuncture and decades of journaling had not done. I feltlike I could forgive all the folks who had unintentionally harmed me, andforgive myself of unintentionally harming myself. That has had tremendousramifications in my family and stays with me on a daily basis. I've learned thatwe are not here to judge one another. Forgiveness is not earned. It is simplythe way forward.”"},{"pageContent":"PREPARATION FOR THE JOURNEYBY RICK STRASSMAN, MDImportant disclaimer: None of the authors of [the book that this essay was firstpublished in, INNER PATHS TO OUTER SPACE], condones any illegal activities, evenwhen it comes to the potentially beneficial effects of altering consciousnesswith a psychedelic drug. In nearly the entire world, it is illegal to possessmajor psychedelics such as mescaline, DMT, LSD, and psilocybin. In someinstances, the plants that contain these chemicals, such as mescaline-containingpeyote cactus and psilocybin-containing magic mushrooms, are also banned.While a discussion of the current laws regarding these plants and chemicals isbeyond the scope of the book, we believe in the maxim “The law of the land isthe law.” Therefore, the authors take no responsibility—legal, medical,psychological, spiritual, or otherwise—for any difficulty in which anyone mayfind him- or herself as a result of manufacturing, possessing, distributing, orusing a psychedelic substance.Nevertheless, the human drive to profoundly alter consciousness in the way thatpsychedelics do so reliably cannot be extinguished. Whereas there clearly areother legal ways in which we may alter our consciousness—meditation, prayer,fasting, extreme sports, and so on—few of us are able to attain a trulypsychedelic state without using drugs or plants. Thus, some may consider thelegal and other risks associated with taking psychedelic substances as lesscompelling than their perceived benefits.Whenever possible, we advise using such materials in licit circumstances. Thereare countries and contexts in which the use of certain psychedelic substances islegal. Examples include Ayahuasca-using churches in the West, centers in LatinAmerica that use Ayahuasca and other psychoactive plants, and peyote-usingchurches in North America, where jurisdictions allow its use for both Nativesand non-Natives.Those preparing for a psychedelic drug experience, even the most seasonedveterans, nearly always feel intense anticipation. The late Secret Chief, a SanFrancisco Bay–area psychologist who supervised thousands, if not tens ofthousands, of psychedelic drug sessions, referred to this feeling ofanticipation of a session as “[t]he trip has already begun.”The Secret Chief was uncannily, unerringly, and extraordinarily accurate—and itmay require some deep thinking to fully understand what he meant. Obviously, themere act of thinking about, discussing, and deciding to undergo a psychedelicdrug session is not the same as actually taking a drug. Nevertheless, by makingsuch a decision, we initiate a cascade of events within the matrix of set andsetting, which form a continuum not only limited to the discrete time periodduring which we are under the influence of a psychedelic, but also spreading inall directions, like the proverbial pebble thrown into the pond. By embarking onthe preliminary stages of taking such a trip, we set in motion certain feelings,thoughts, and actions that lead to a potentially life-changing event. Our liveshave already come under the influence of the trip.Set and setting, the two primary factors involved in determining the outcome ofthe inner journey to outer space, are themselves modifiable via the two primarytasks of that journey: getting ready and letting go.GETTING READYIn order to derive the most benefit from making any journey, inner or outer, wemust do what we can to minimize the risks of a negative outcome and optimize thechances for a positive one. Once we have established the most solid foundationpossible, we can be more assured of the beneficial outcome that may result fromtruly letting go.We possess the power to determine the nature and course of our trip much as wepossess the power to determine the nature and course of our lives. On the onehand, our lives are undeniably constrained by the circumstances of our birth:our genetic makeup; who our parents are; and the chemical, social, andpsychological environment into which we were born. In addition, we are subjectto the “accidents” continuously coming our way: those chance encounters thatplay such an important role in who we are and what we do. On the other hand, wealso have the choice of how to regard and react to these circumstances. This maybe what is meant by the maxim “Everything is in the hand of heaven except theawe of heaven.”At the same time, we must not forget that the ultimate purpose and context ofour lives is vast and ultimately unknowable. In this case, we can refer to thecomplementary maxim “The work is never done, but we must never cease from doingit.” We must do everything we can to develop our intention and attitude towardwhat awaits us in the psychedelic state. Then, when we meet what awaits us, wecan allow it to show us what it will and take us where it will.There are several practical considerations in getting ready for a session. Wecan parse these into a general temporal scheme: long-term work, intermediatework, and short-term work.LONG-TERM WORKIf we know ourselves—our state and traits—as best as possible, we will be ableto contend with any likely resistance to the letting go that is requisite forthe optimal journey. This self-knowledge cannot be acquired quickly but ratherrequires years and decades. Nevertheless, at some point, anyone who will makethis journey must begin walking the path to inner knowledge.The two most common ways of increasing self-knowledge and learning how we relateto ourselves and others—those enduring and deep-seated elements of our set—arepsychotherapy and spiritual practice. Although some consider the two atcross-purposes, they may be combined in very useful ways, because they exhibitcommon elements in theory, technique, and goals. Both use focused self-awarenessto observe, understand, accept, and modify our feelings, thoughts, and behaviorsin order that we may live more fulfilling, satisfying lives. Whereas meditationmay emphasize awareness of mental, cognitive, and perceptual processes, Westernpsychotherapy usually relates to working with emotional concerns.Spiritual or religious practice may be shorn of much of its theological contentand rituals by emphasizing primarily its benefits in the development ofself-awareness and the cultivation of desired mental states. For example,sustained concentration on our bodies and minds in a regular meditation practicecan help make apparent several core issues: How do we experience anxiety—in ourbodies or mentally? If we perceive anxiety in both the body and mind, whichperception comes first? What of vulnerability, happiness, and fear? What are ourfears? Is it our nature to share with others or keep to ourselves?Prayer, perhaps in a way we usually don't consider, also may provide access tohelpful discoveries. Praying to an outside source of help or wisdom may resultin many of the same answers regarding who we are and how we function in theworld—answers similar to those that might arise in a meditation practice. Wherewe acquire such information may not matter fundamentally within the context ofsimply obtaining increased self-knowledge and efficacy. In addition, regularmeditation or prayer practice does much to develop our muscles of attention, andwe can then apply our strengthened ability to focus toward examining ourselvesin ways we may not have been capable of engaging previously.A reliable, dependable, empathetic, and admirable teacher can be of great helpin this process. He or she can provide instruction and encouragement and serveas a role model who encourages us to persist in our practice. In addition tothese more formal teaching functions, an effective meditation or prayer teacherallows for the development of a close relationship between him- or herself andstudents. An open-eyed examination of the nature of this relationship—its upsand downs, misinterpretations, and projections—can be invaluable to our processof discovering who we really are.Effective psychotherapy shares features with an effective meditation of prayerpractice. These include paying attention to areas of difficulty in our lives. Bylooking carefully at what situations stir up particular emotions, thoughts, andbehaviors, we may discover previously unacknowledged emotional and cognitivehabits that served us at one time but no longer do so. Within the traditionalpsychotherapeutic setting, we find the relationship that develops betweenstudent and therapist more commonly subject to careful examination. Thisanalysis of the transference is especially the case within the psychoanalyticframework.If our meditation or prayer practice is focused on more than self-examinationand self-improvement, it will begin forcing us to ask larger questions thatalmost certainly will arise in any deep psychedelic work. These questionsconcern the existence, nature, and providence of God; the reason for our birth;the nature of this reality; enlightenment; and how to contend with nonphysicalrealities and encounters with alien or spiritual or noncorporeal beings. Thedeeper mystical teachings of the religions from which these meditation or prayerpractices emerge are well equipped to provide answers to these questions. We maythus find ourselves pursuing a deeper involvement in a particular religion.Conversely, the typical psychotherapeutic endeavor is not as concerned withspiritual issues—though any good psychotherapist knows the limits of his or herskill and will make a timely and appropriate referral to a spiritual teacherwhen necessary. In the same manner, a competent spiritual teacher will recognizethe need for a psychotherapy referral when mood, thought, or personality issuesappear to be interfering with progress in a meditation or prayer practice.INTERMEDIATE WORKOnce we have decided to take a psychedelic journey, we can start preparing inspecific ways. To the extent possible, we can educate ourselves regarding whatto expect on our trip. Having some sense of the expected terrain, as describedby those who have gone before, can be quite helpful. In this way, if others havealerted us to what to expect, we may not be surprised when we encounterphenomena far beyond the range of what is familiar to us.The literature regarding near-death and out-of-body experiences, meditation,abduction, shamanism, and of course, the taking of psychedelic drugs contains awealth of information about others' experiences. It can provide us with helpfulbackground information as well as practical means of dealing with those states.Also recommended is speaking with others who have gone before, listening totalks, and getting involved in online groups of the various communities thatdiscuss highly altered states of consciousness—and not only those concerned withthe effects of psychedelic drugs.Some might object on the grounds that these educational activities may bias ustoward particular expectations that can lead to certain specific types ofexperiences at the expense of others—yet these arguments are not especiallypersuasive. The truly psychedelic experience is totally unexpected.Nevertheless, knowing how unexpected it can be may help us to keep our bearingswhen confronted with it. We will be ready for the unexpected.Discuss the impending trip with your therapist or spiritual teacher if you haveone. However, it should not come as a surprise if the stigma attached to druguse causes spiritual teachers to discourage the taking of them. This may be thecase even if he or she has personally beneficial experiences with psychedelics.Faced with disapproval from someone in whom we have placed great faith and whohas previously been very helpful to us, we may need to shelve the topic ofpsychedelic use and continue our work with him or her without any continuedinterference caused by such a discussion. Or perhaps we may decide to seekinstruction elsewhere, in a context in which we can discuss how psychedelic drugexperiences may work together with therapy or meditation or prayer.Those who are taking medication should make certain that there are no possibleadverse interactions with these medications and the psychedelic drugsconsidered. For those who are taking medications for conditions that can also bemanaged by lifestyle changes such as exercise; weight loss; diet adjustments;and the cessation of the use of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and other drugs, tryto follow through with these changes first to see if some of the medications mayno longer be necessary. The point is to simplify body chemistry as much aspossible. Though the reasons behind the desire to stop medications may remainprivate, the actual process of trying to discontinue them must be taken up withyour health care provider.INTENTOnce we have decided we want to experience a psychedelic drug session, we musthome in on our intent. As the Secret Chief asked, “To what purpose?” Why are wedoing this, and what do we hope to accomplish or gain from such an experience?Is it primarily curiosity that drives us—are we intellectually and emotionallydrawn to novelty, to something new, exotic, and exciting? Do we wish toexperience pleasure of an extraordinary degree? Do we have an emotional,artistic, creative, professional, spiritual, or interpersonal problem we want tosolve? Are we seeking a spiritual experience or answers to our deepestyearnings? Do we wish to know God—to see him or her face-to-face? Do we hope foran encounter with the angels of the powers through which God manifests? Are weinterested in outer-space travel, sciencefiction revelations, journeys throughtime, and encounters with alien civilizations and their inhabitants? Do we wishto obtain information and power for good or for ill? Do we want to make theworld a better place—or do we intend to hurt those who have hurt us? Do we wishto suffer? Do we want to create a situation in which we replay abusive past orpresent relationships?There are so many possible motivations to take a trip—and any of these maycompete and blend with one another. We must be as honest as possible withourselves when deciding what our intentions are, realizing that having aparticular intention doesn't necessarily guarantee the content of the session.We don't always have the trip we want; instead, we seem to have the trip weneed. If we tell ourselves that our motivation is, perhaps, to learn more aboutour relationships, but more honestly, we want to have a good time, we may beunpleasantly surprised when we're actually confronted by deeper, more painfulpsychological issues. Conversely, we may approach the experience with deepsolemnity and expectations for a divine encounter and then be similarlyunprepared for the fun, lighthearted aspects of our session. Thus, it isimportant to understand the full range and complementary nature of ourmotivations. Ideally, this is accomplished through the use of the introspectiveskills we have obtained during our own inner work, either spiritual orpsychotherapeutic.It is worth noting that developing an intention to undergo a spiritual,otherworldly, near-death transcendent type of experience is, in some ways, thesame as making the decision to subvert the dominant Western postindustrialworldview. That is, the total loss of self-control and our usual self-identityand the wish to interact with and be guided by spiritual entities whose mercy wecount upon fly in the face of a materialistic, individualistic, and fear-basedrelationship to existence. It also runs contrary to a solely clergy-mediatedrelationship to the divine. If and when we do have this type of experience, wemust realize that the mainstream, using the tools of ridicule andpsychopathologizing, among others, will oppose our discussing and valuing it.SHORT-TERM WORKHow do we prepare ourselves in the day or two before the psychedelic journey?First, it is paramount that we understand our intentions. Then, by attending tocertain concrete matters, we validate our intention to mark this experience asunique. The essence of making something holy or sacred is to separate ordistinguish between the sacred and the profane. Though at the absolute level ofreality, there are no such differences between what is sacred and what isprofane, at the relative level, in which most of us exist most of the time, thetwo do differ. Thus, it is important to manifest our inner intent through ourphysical reality. We want to perceive as clearly as possible our psychedelicexperience without the muddying effects of influences such as fatigue and anunsafe environment.It's important to approach the trip in good health and with a positive state ofmind and to be well rested and have a clean body and clean clothes. Participantsshould be careful with what they eat, drink, and smoke several days before thetrip. Further, are there loose ends requiring attention? Are these minor tasks,such as taking out the garbage, making a necessary phone call, and paying anoverdue bill, or are some more significant, such as updating a will? Thoughupdating a will may appear morbid, consider the prospect that while undergoing anear-death experience, you may recall that you have no will! Would youremotional reactions to your sense of dying be different if you knew you hadtaken care of those you were leaving behind?Before taking any psychedelics, it is recommended that you check in with thosewho are most important in your life. Are we on good terms with our partner,spouse, family, friends, and business associates? An extra prayer, meditationsession, or psychotherapy appointment or two in the days before a trip can makeclear some internal or external issues that might require special attention.SETTINGClearly perceiving our intent naturally leads us to decide upon the setting, thecircumstances in which we will be taking the trip. Earlier, we discovereddifferent categories of experiences resulting from psychedelic-drug ingestion.We can use these categories as a model for conceptualizing the types of tripsavailable to us: * A pleasurable trip that fulfills curiosity * A problem-solving session that addresses psychotherapeutic issues we want to work on or creative, professional, or other concerns * A spiritual, near-death experience or otherworldly journeyAlso to be considered are the particulars of the trip. These include: * Environment—outdoors or indoors * The dose of the drug * Whether we will journey alone or in a group * Whether we will have a sitter * Accoutrements for our trip such as music or art supplies * Supplemental techniques for reaching altered states of consciousnessFinally, we must consider if the session will take place in a research setting.All types of trips can take place in a research environment; it is important,however, to note the constraints and opportunities unique to this type ofsetting—the most important of which concerns the issue of altruism, the notionof giving up something in our own trip for the benefit of others.IS THE SETTING OUTDOORS OR INDOORS?An outdoor setting of natural beauty can lead to profound levels ofidentification or merging with the natural world, yet being outdoors is alsoless predictable than being indoors. These unpredictable factors includeinsects, animals, inclement weather, unwelcome intrusions by other people, dirtof all kinds, and lack of facilities if participants fall ill or feelparticularly helpless.An outdoor setting in a city or suburb can provide a unique perspective onhumanity, but it lends itself more to an externally oriented and at timespotentially chaotic experience. Such a setting requires us to be prepared forexposure to a wide array of interpersonal and technical challenges. An indoorsetting in an area of natural beauty can combine the best of both worlds: thesafety and predictability of an indoor space and the option of going outside toexperience nature.DOSAGE, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION, AND COMBINING DRUGSWe can divide doses into low, intermediate, and high. Usually, the higher thedose of drug, the more intense and longer-lasting the effects. Yet there aremany cases in which the same person experiences a marked effect from a smalldose and seems less affected by a large dose at some other time. Instead ofserving as examples of tolerance, in which repeated dosing decreases subsequentresponses, or sensitization, in which low initial doses increase the effects ofsubsequent low doses, there seems to be some poorly understood interplay amongdose, set, and setting that results in dose not being invariably related tointensity and duration of effect.There is merit in beginning with a low dose of any substance that is new to us,whether that “substance” is a relationship, an exercise routine, or apsychedelic drug. As is true most of the time, however, the true nature of anyparticular relationship is rarely known without receiving a full dose. Thus atsome point, for the truly adventurous explorer of these realms, sooner or latera high dose plays a role in his or her work with the substance and the realmsinto which it leads.Another consideration is route of administration. There are various ways toadminister a drug. Intravenous injection, smoking, and snorting are the fastestways to experience effects. Slower onset occurs with routes such asintramuscular and subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. Slower yet aregastrointestinal methods, such as swallowing or rectal administration. Topicalapplication to the skin or mucous membranes varies in speed, depending upon theintegrity of the tissue—that is, effects occur more quickly from applying a drugto a wound or open sore than from applying it to intact, calloused skin. Inaddition, the “carrier” for the topically applied drug, the solvent into whichit is dissolved, can make a big difference in the speed of absorption. Forexample, DMSO (dimethylsufoxide) is a solvent that allows for very rapid skinabsorption of a drug, whereas cocoa butter is absorbed by the skin more slowly.It's also best to choose one dose of one drug for a particular session and thenstick to that decision. Participants may feel the need to take more of asubstance if the effects are not as hoped for—what some refer to as taking a“booster” dose. While there are instances of this booster being an integral partof the experience—for example, in indigenous Ayahuasca sessions—it is advisableto exercise caution in this area. Particularly when alone, impaired judgment maylead to making ill-advised decisions and can lead to taking a dose that is toohigh. Remember, there is always the next time to take more.Neither is it advisable to mix substances. Doing so blurs the effect of one orthe other and may produce toxic interactions.SOLO OR GROUP: THE ROLE OF STRUCTUREIn this instance, the term structure refers to behavioral parameters that weimpose upon ourselves during a session. Such parameters are for our own safetyand comfort as well as the optimization of the trip. Further, when we are in agroup setting, establishing a structure is intended to respect others' feelingsand needs. There are several options regarding how many people we decide tojourney with: we may travel solo, with a small group of friends or strangers, orwith a larger group of friends or strangers.SOLOSafety concerns suggest having a trusted individual or individuals in our spacewhen we take psychedelics, but sometimes none is available. In addition, we maywant to journey free from interpersonal interference; we may not want company.Nevertheless, it is relatively imprudent to embark solo on a first trip. Evenafter we've gained some familiarity with a particular drug, it's wise to let aconfidant know of our plans and whereabouts when we take the drug again.If we do take the journey alone, it is important to think through certain issuesbeforehand and to decide upon responses to which we can adhere. It's importantto gain familiarity with these structural issues from those who are moreexperienced with taking a drug, and that we spend some time establishingreasonable and appropriate guidelines for our session. Though we might hope tocommit these guidelines to memory, once the time comes, it is helpful to havethem available in written form in case we are unable to recall them. In mostcases, when we are under the influence, it is ill advised to change thestructure we have set up before taking the drug. It is important to rememberthat we can always change the guidelines for our next session, when we have hadsome time to think about these issues after we've had the experience of onejourney.There are many structural issues to consider, especially if we are taking thedrug alone. Will we be listening to music? If so, will we set up our playlistbeforehand or decide what we will listen to when we are in an altered state ofconsciousness? Do we intend to keep our eyes open or closed? Would we likeeyeshades? Will we remain clothed? How much of the session will we spend lyingdown versus sitting up and walking around? When and what do we eat? How will wemake sure we drink enough fluids? Under what circumstances might we take more ofa drug or smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol or coffee? After our trip, when canwe drive or leave the immediate premises? What about answering the telephone ormaking calls? How do we get help if we need it? What do we do if things becomeunbearable—do we want to have tranquilizer on hand to chemically abort the trip?GROUPWhenever more than one person in the room is under the influence, we must takeinto consideration other people's set and setting issues; however, this mayquickly ferment into a frothy brew of personalities and interactions. Therefore,in group settings—particularly in a new group—it is important to have additionalelements of the structure decided and agreed upon in advance. One way tominimize stresses associated with a group session is for each person to have hisor her solo trip. The use of eyeshades and well-spaced, single-sized mattressesor pads will help effect well-demarcated, individual experiences in a groupsetting. As drug effects wear off, interactions might then begin outside themain room in order not to distract those who want to continue with a moreinner-directed experience.Ye the purpose of a group setting, particularly with lower and intermediatedoses, may be to engage in some group activity such as playing or listening tomusic, sharing an aesthetic experience, or problem solving. In cases such asthese, we might spend most of our time exploring how the group process isaffected by the influence of the psychedelic. Most important, however, is thatthese expectations and ground rules be discussed and agreed upon before asession begins.There are other concerns in a group: How do we signal that we are in need (thatis, do we raise our hand or speak)? How would we like to be supported? Issupport verbal or physical? How are decisions made regarding our welfare orbehavior? If some find the music, incense, or room temperature or lightingunpleasant, how will this be managed? In addition, will others in the group besober or intoxicated? If intoxicated, will everyone in the group be taking thesame drug? How will we know?Whereas certain variables lend themselves to more or less flexible responses,some structural issues are best adhered to rather strictly. For example,intercourse or sexual interactions of any kind between participants during thesession should be prohibited, as should physical, verbal, or emotional actingout of aggression. It is unwise to ask for or accept material favors such asmoney or property during the group session. Certainly, we may ask for and acceptfavors whose consequences do not extend beyond the session, such as a blanket ifwe are cold, a book for viewing, and the like. Asking for favors that requirefollow-through outside of the session, however, should wait until everyone isback to a normal state of consciousness. In addition, everyone must remain inthe group until previously agreed-upon criteria have been met—for example, thegroup leader has determined that drug effects are adequately resolved and, ifthere is no leader, everyone must get a good night's sleep before leaving.Privacy and confidentiality are crucial in the success of any such group, andtherefore, everyone must agree never to mention with whom they took a group tripwithout the express permission of the others involved.One of the advantages of the group setting is the option of having a period oforganized sharing after the session, usually the day after the experience. Thiscan be quite helpful in terms of the crucial reentry and reintegration necessaryfor optimal use of the session.THE SITTERAlong with the question of who else is in the room tripping with us, animportant question concerns whether anyone is “sitting” for those under theinfluence. The sitter supervises a psychedelic session much like a babysittersupervises children—those who take psychedelics may need the same kind ofsteering, restraining, and nurturing. In addition, it derives from thesimilarity between sitting in meditation and supervising a psychedelic session.The sitter must combine the skill of allowing people under his or her care to gothrough whatever takes place in a psychedelic trip and the skill of remainingalert and focused on the needs of those who are journeying. This combination ofalert passivity and passive activity is a hallmark of many meditation practices.Whether we are tripping on our own or in a group without a designated sitter,ostensibly there is a greater sense of freedom to have the type of trip wewant—yet, particularly with high-dose sessions, it may be easier to let go morecompletely if we feel someone is taking care of us. In addition, the relativeanarchy that may reign in a group setting, especially if people are on highdoses, can be difficult to orchestrate. One or more sitters can provide a muchneeded supervisory function in such a setting.Some sitters may lead sessions more actively rather than simply responding tothe needs of participants. Those trained in a shamanic model may play musicalinstruments, sing, whistle, dance, shout, manipulate bodies physically andenergetically, and pour, run, or spit various liquids, smokes, and powders ontoparticipants.SET OF THE SITTERThough there are many reasons to trip with a sitter, it is important to beextraordinarily careful regarding under whose supervision we place ourselveswhen we are taking psychedelics. Such consideration both makes the most ofsessions and works to avoid problems. It's useful to note that participants willbe deeply involved with this person at all stages of a trip—before, during, andafter. The sitter is in a position of authority, leadership, and support, andthose who will participate in a session are well advised to learn what they canabout that person.Some questions include: Is he or she religiously or spiritually oriented? Is heor she a member of any particular religion or profession? What is his or hertraining? What about sexual orientation? Is he or she married, or does he or shehave children? Does a potential sitter drink alcohol or use drugs, and if so,does he or she use them excessively or in moderation? Is he or she vegetarian?What are his or her motivations for supervising sessions—money, a desire toheal, sadism, curiosity, altruism, voyeurism, career advancement? How does he orshe relate to the power and reputation that a sitter may accrue? What is his orher experience with these compounds in terms of administration to others as wellas regarding personal use? Is this someone of whom we can ask questions and withwhom we can work out plans for various situations that might arise during ourtrip? Do we feel we can trust this person to give us guidance and support whenwe are unable to provide these for ourselves?We strongly encourage asking prospective sitters any or all questions whoseanswers will affect participants' feelings of safety and encouragement during asession. Included in these questions is a discussion of issues regardingstructure. In addition, because it is so difficult to obtain psychedelic drugs,the person who supervises a session may be the one from whom participants obtainthe drug. This is usually the case in small-group and shamanic sessions, and isalways true in the research environment.IS THE SITTER EXPERIENCED?Within the shamanic tradition, it is axiomatic that the leader is intimately andthoroughly familiar with all manner of drugs and plants that he or she willadminister to others. This is also usually the case in the West with those whosit for underground users of psychedelics. Empathy—knowing what another isfeeling—is quite important in any healing or spiritual work and is found mostoften when the healer has previously undergone a similar experience. Even if thesetting is not intended to address healing or spiritual issues directly, thesemay nevertheless arise at any time, and the sitter should be capable ofresponding appropriately.Within the academic setting in the United States, a sitter's personal use of thepsychedelic in question is discouraged. This is one of the unfortunate resultsof the Harvard research group's widely publicized personal use of psychedelicsin the 1960s. Yet Western European researchers are required to “go first” in anyof their own psychedelic studies. There are several reasons for this: in orderto make sure drugs and doses are safe, these scientists believe it is moreethical to first self-administer an experimental treatment, especially if thereis no significant therapeutic benefit expected. By going first, they bear thebrunt of any adverse effects. In addition, European regulatory authoritiesbelieve that the informed consent process is better served if the researchersare personally familiar with the effects of the drug. As a result of their ownexperience, they then are more able to inform a prospective volunteer fullyregarding what to expect, and they can be more empathetic during the actual drugstudies.IS THE SITTER TRIPPING AT THE SAME TIME?It's important to know if, at the time of a session, a sitter is under theinfluence of a psychedelic. It's also important to determine how participantswill know whether or not the sitter takes a drug. Often, in shamanic orindigenous settings, the leader also partakes of a psychedelic substance, thoughperhaps at a lower dose than the participants in order to retain the ability tomove around and interact. This empathetic resonance among those who areexperiencing a particular drug effect helps the sitter provide an especiallydeep level of support and guidance. In Western models, however, this is anevolving area; some leaders ingest psychedelics, others do not.In an academic setting, it is unlikely that the researcher will also use thesame psychedelic substance during the study period. The extraordinarily rarepossibility exists that a sitter under the influence of the same drug would alsobe the object of study. For example, a research project might ask whether atherapist is more or less helpful while affected by the same psychedelic used byparticipants. Whatever the case, answers to the question of the leader's use ofthe drug should be addressed ahead of time. There have been a number ofsituations in which group leaders have acted inappropriately while intoxicated,crossing important boundaries and later using as an excuse the effects of thedrug.ACCOUTREMENTSMusic can evoke profound effects in a highly psychedelicized individual. Itusually is easier to arrange music beforehand, either by the solo tripper or, inthe case of a group session, in consultation with the sitter if there is one. Ina group setting, it is advisable to consider a “veto” rule regarding music: Ifanyone finds the music intolerable, it must be discontinued. Music withunderstandable lyrics can sometimes be distracting or can constrain theexperiences. Instrumental music or world music with lyrics that areunintelligible may allow for more fluidity in reaction to it. Playing musicalinstruments in a solo setting may help a participant express nonverbal,nonvisual elements of a trip. In a group setting, however, participants musttake into account the reactions of other group members.Art supplies, particularly during the “coming down,” resolution period of atrip, can aid in giving form, shape, and color to otherwise nonverbal aspects ofthe experience. Writing materials also may be helpful, and in solo settings, avoice-recording device can capture fleeting ideas. Some people find looking intoa mirror while tripping to be particularly evocative, especially in a sessionwith a primarily spiritual or psychotherapeutic focus. Similarly, reviewingfamily photos from the past and present can stimulate the release of manyemotions and insights.SUPPLEMENTAL TECHNIQUESThere are many nondrug-based methods available for altering consciousness. Thesemay be helpful in refocusing attention for those who might feel adrift in thepsychedelic space or who might be physically uncomfortable. Examples of thesetechniques include yoga, massage, and a quiet form of meditation. Othertechniques may help participants break through a particular psychic impasse in atrip. These include controlled hyperventilation, singing, dancing, and exercise.It's a good idea to be familiar and comfortable with these ancillary techniquesbefore trying them in a psychedelicized condition. It's also important thatparticipants not expose themselves to stressful or traumatic interventionsunless that is one of the purposes of the trip. For example, participants maywish to work through their resistance to a particular yoga posture that theynormally find too difficult to attain.TYPES OF TRIPSKeep in mind that despite the type of trip we wish to have, and despite decidingupon the dose, where we are, who we are with, and the activities available tous, we may not have the kind of experience we wanted. For example, we may expecta relatively minor, pleasurable experience, but we may instead reach anear-death state. We must be ready for anything to occur during a trip, nomatter how much effort we expend in preparation. Also, it is rare that any onetrip consists of only one particular type. Psychedelic experiences arenotoriously varied. We enter and exit many levels during any one session.Nevertheless, there are general types of sessions and advisable relatedparameters.AESTHETIC, PLEASURE-ORIENTED TRIPSThese journeys may occur outside, in an environment of natural beauty, or theymay occur in a setting of manmade beauty that features music, art, orarchaeological relics. Ideally, participants will have access to bothenvironments. If we are alone, we may take a walk in the woods, visit a museum,play or listen to music, or get a massage. For this type of trip occurringsolely in an urban setting, it is best to take a low dose of psychedelic.These types of trips lend themselves to group experiences. Examples of largegroup settings include contemporary “raves”—large-venue dance events—and eventssuch as Burning Man, in the Nevada desert, where tens of thousands of peoplecongregate. Also fitting this type of intention are smaller groups, such asseveral friends who “hang out” together and enjoy each other's company in apsychedelic state.Usually, there are sessions without a sitter or leader. The spontaneity andfreedom that we seek in such a setting, with doses generally being relativelylow, do not require much supervision. It's a good idea, however, to make certainthat noninebriated people are available who know of participants' condition andwhereabouts.PROBLEM-SOLVING SESSIONSWe may decide to use a psychedelic drug to help work on personal, professional,or creative concerns. Lower and intermediate doses provide more ease inmaintaining focus on these issues and recalling our solutions when we returnfrom our journey.Enhancing creativity with psychedelics may occur outdoors or indoors, dependingupon the particular task. An unobtrusive sitter can help record our newapproaches to problems and can provide encouragement and focus. We may want helpwithin the context of a psychotherapeutic process, using the effects ofpsychedelics to modify the processes by which psychological healing occurs—thatis, projection, transference, abreaction, and catharsis. In psychotherapeuticsessions, it's usually helpful to have someone acting as a sitter. This may beour own therapist or someone whom we only work with in psychedelic sessions. Ina psychotherapeutic group setting, some people may be in therapy with thesitter, while others may not.Lower doses in the psychotherapeutic setting allow for a better focus thanhigher ones and provide the basis of psycholytic psychotherapy. High-dosesessions, referred to as psychedelic psychotherapy, add the qualitatively uniquespiritual, mystical, or near-death states to the quantitative augmentation ofnormal psychotherapeutic processes. Religious and spiritual issues often becomeconscious and important in psychedelic psychotherapy.If we are working on interpersonal issues, we and those with whom we want towork through these problems might be journeying together. We may choose to beginthe session solo and later come together with other group members. Because ofthe sometimes intense dynamics that may arise even with low or medium doses, itis helpful to have a sitter in this type of session.One model of psychedelic psychotherapy combines high doses of drug withoverpowering, multimodal sensory stimulation in an indoor group setting. Thisparticular technique is intended to cause a breakdown of psychological defensesnot deemed possible by any one modality alone. Yet such experiences aredifficult to negotiate and later to integrate.It is usually easier to work on psychological issues in an indoor setting,although access to the natural world can provide a necessary balance for theintense inner work that engages participants.SPIRITUAL, NEAR-DEATH, AND OTHERWORLDLY EXPERIENCESThese breakthrough experiences usually lend themselves to large-dose,introspective, solo settings. They also require the most in terms of our abilityto let go and open ourselves to highly unusual effects. If we choose involvementin a group setting, the emphasis usually remains on an individual's experience,at least in the initial and middle stages of the trip.It is easier for us to maintain an inward focus in an indoor setting.Nevertheless, nature can provide powerful catalysts for such experiences. If wedecide to take this type of trip outdoors, we must do our best to ensure thatparticipants are safe and free from unexpected disturbances.If there is a sitter, he or she is unlikely to be a minister of any organizedreligion. Rather, those trained in the shamanic tradition are usually capable ofcontaining and guiding these types of sessions. In the postindustrial West,sitters are often psychologically or spiritually trained individuals with theirown psychedelic experience. Supplemental techniques such as controlledhyperventilation can be useful in providing the final impetus for the desiredbreakthrough.As alluded to earlier, these types of experiences usually require us to beplaced into uncomfortable inner spaces. The giving up of cherished selfconceptsand identifications necessary to emerge anew into our reality is nearly alwaysquite distressing at some pint—and once we have had this type of experience,there is little social support for discussing its merits within the largersocial mainstream. Social and spiritual support to help integrate such deepexperiences is necessary and must be part of the preparation for any plannedbreakthrough session.VOLUNTEERING TO BE IN A RESEARCH STUDYAny of these types of trips can be experienced within the research setting.Volunteering to be a research subject, however, even for a study that mayprovide benefit—such as psychotherapy, mysticism, or creativityresearch—involves the element of altruism, of giving up something in our owntrip for the greater good. This altruism generates a unique dynamic between usand our setting, particularly to those in the room with us. When we volunteerfor a research study, the trip is not all ours. We are being asked—and areexpected—to provide data and information rather than just have an experience forour own sake. While this is neither intrinsically good nor bad, theinformed-consent process must be open and transparent, and this altruism must beacknowledged at the outset. From the beginning, there exist competing interestsbetween our trip and the data we are generating—and we will not be allowed toforget this give-and-take that's superimposed upon our trip. It's important thatresearch subjects not be surprised by, rebel against, or resent the exigenciesof providing data. For example, as we may be traversing the deepest reaches ofinner space, our vein may clot, and the nurse will flush the intravenous linewith jarringly cold water or he or she might need to remove the line and replaceit with another.Those who are neophytes to psychedelic states must consider these issuescarefully. “Sharing” a trip in this way can be likened to having our firstsexual experience observed, with data and specimens collected. We might be moregenerous with our time, body, mind, and soul after we've gained some experienceand familiarity with such new and intense experiences. Nevertheless, it ispossible to participate in a research setting during our first psychedelicexperience and have it turn out better than one we undergo alone or withfriends. Perhaps the setting takes into account our inexperience and is designedto determine those factors that contribute to the best outcome. Such researchprojects are rare, though, and regardless of their intent, they must stillcollect data.Research settings are characterized by a relatively constrained physicalenvironment. They are almost always indoors, range of movement is restricted,and there are few surprises. Generally speaking, accoutrements or supplementalconsciousness-altering methods are few or unavailable. These constraints areintended to keep constant as many variables as possible while modifying onlythose of interest. For example, the researcher may vary the dose of drug in theexact same setting to determine the effects of dose on the measured variablessuch as heart rate and blood pressure. It is interesting to note that though theusual hospital research unit is not especially peaceful, there we may have asense of medical security—for instance, knowing that a cardiac resuscitationteam is nearby—that is otherwise absent. In these studies, we are usually theonly one in the environment taking a psychedelic drug.Once we have decided to participate in research, there are two general typesfrom which to choose: biological and psychological. The emphasis in the formeris on data regarding our bodies, and the emphasis in the latter is on dataregarding our minds. Biological studies may include subjective effects in theirpurview. They are called psychopharmacological—that is, seeking thepharmacological underpinnings of subjective experiences. Psychobiologicalstudies, or psychophysiological studies, attempt to explicate the physiology ofthe mind. For example, these may assess the effects of psychedelics oninvoluntary aspects of perception, such as how we respond to images presented toone or both eyes using various sequences and time intervals.The tools used in biological research may include brain-imaging equipment, someof which may be noisy and tight fitting and may involve being injected with aradioactive drug. Participants may have blood drawn to quantify levels of anynumber of factors: hormones, immune function, and metabolism of the drug inquestion or other drugs. Body temperature may be monitored, as maycardiovascular responses such as blood pressure and heart rate using anautomatic blood pressure cuff.Psychological studies can be divided into roughly two different categories:problem solving and phenomenological. We have previously discussed some of theparameters involved in problem solving with psychedelics as well as thedifference in psychotherapeutic work between lower-dose psycholytic andhigher-dose psychedelic therapy. In the research setting, the goals are similar,but the structure is more rigorously adhered to.Phenomenologically based psychological studies focus on the mental rather thanbiological effects of psychedelics—that is, perception of time, color, distance,and depth. Rather than assessing perceptual, information-processing mentalfunctions, psychoanalytic studies may investigate more complex phenomena such asprojection, transference, mood reactivity, and free association.Finally, studies may investigate the efficacy of psychedelics in elicitingmystical, near-death, and otherworldly experiences. These are somewhat moredifficult to categorize within a research setting because they deal withconcepts that, for many, fall outside of the purview of traditional scientificinquiry. Nevertheless, they partake of the general research model, limitingvariables as much as possible and providing data to the research team.LETTING GOOnce we have completed as much preparatory work as possible before a session andclarified our intent—thus choosing our setting—we are ready to turn ourattention to the actual trip.On the day of the session, we should be well rested and clear-eyed, feelingready for whatever may come our way. Though it's a good idea to have water orice chips available during the session to address thirst and dehydration, aperson should not plan on eating any food or drinking alcohol.The fundamental task required for an optimal psychedelic experience is somewhatparadoxical: it consists of actively establishing the direction in which wedecide to let go. We consciously choose the cliff from which we will jump andwith what attitude we make that leap. This is especially the case in high-dosesessions during which we hope to encounter the most radical and unusualexperiences.Resistance to high-dose, powerful trips can be extraordinarily painful andconfusing. An open-eyed, level-headed surrendering of resistance is the mosteffective way to prevent being thrown into this maelstrom and is the best methodfor pulling ourselves out of it if we do find ourselves overboard. Prayers,mantras, mudras, visualization, music, bodywork, and other aids may be helpfulat various points in our trip to redirect the flow of experience. At thedeepest, most exposed, raw, and vulnerable moments of the psychedelic encounter,however, it is only through letting go that we find ourselves making the mostprogress. From the five minutes of the DMT flash to the twelve hours of anibogaine ordeal, this surrender is the crux of a successful journey.The foundation laid by any previous inner work will hold us in good stead atsuch times by virtue of the attention skills we have developed. These skillsmake it easier to remain focused when confronted with the unexpected. Inaddition, effective psychotherapy or spiritual practice will have made usfamiliar with the skeletons in our closets and will have better equipped us tocontend with them if and when they emerge. Thus, not only do we clearly perceivewhat is garnering our attention, but also we subsequently open up and drop ourresistances to it. We will know when we are resisting and when we are movingforward at any given moment of the psychedelic experience.Yet it is not only in negative aspects of a trip that we may become blocked. Wealso might be unable to move out of pleasant or neutral states. For example, wemight find ourselves deeply blissful but also sense that we can go even deeperinto what lies beneath and supports that bliss. Seemingly innocuous images orfeelings, such as the curtain of psychedelic lights that is often a hallmark ofthe drug experience, may stand in our way. We want to see even more, but wecannot take the next step.All these states can be managed to facilitate our moving forward; we can slowdown, right ourselves, and then go on. We regain our balance through the properapplication of attention and awareness. This is the slowing down, which we canfacilitate physically through relaxed, deep breathing and helps release anytension in our bodies. Once we've slowed ourselves down and replanted ourpsychic feet, it is easier to move our consciousness through the resistance orblock. Sometimes, however, we may not feel we have a body to relax or lungsthrough which to breathe. At these times, it may be useful simply to bring ourminds back to what is happening and to approach it in a positive, bright, andcurious manner. For example, in my DMT work, I prepared volunteers by warningthem that they might find themselves convinced that they had died. They couldreact in one of two ways: “Oh, my God, I'm dying—get me out of here!” or “I seemto have died. Very interesting. What's next?”This approach creates the smallest space between being aware of an object (suchas an emotion, thought, or perception) and having a relationship with it—inother words, just before we establish a relationship with it. The leverageexists in that microsecond gap; we become aware of the stuck or static nature ofthe relationship. Then, taking a psychic deep breath, we can pull back from itever so slightly, enough to work ourselves through or out of the block. Forexample, with respect to the curtain of psychedelic lights, we can look forspace or cracks within it and then pass through it.ENCOUNTERING BEINGSOne of the most profound aspects of a psychedelic session is contact with alienor noncorporeal, spiritual, or invisible beings or entities. Upon experiencingsuch an encounter, the first task we must pursue is to regain our composure fromthe shock of meeting what appear to be sentient creatures in our newlydiscovered worlds—creatures that, in many instances, seem to have been waitingfor us. Next, we are faced with how to relate to them.Some beings appear to be kind, gentle, and concerned for our welfare. Othersseem to be aggressive, angry, and hurtful. Some present in an ambiguous ormischievous manner. They may communicate more or less effectively, or they mayignore us altogether. While their sheer novelty and unexpectedness make us feela sense of awe, it may be best, whenever possible, to appraise them with thesame objectivity with which we would judge any chance encounter with strangers.At the time of such encounters, we don't know these beings' language or culture,nor do we know their intent. As with all elements of the psychedelic experience,it's important not to become obsessed with them or our reaction to them. Once weestablish a modicum of stability in our interactions with them and have decidedthey are “safe,” we can engage them in any number of ways—we can seek theirhelp, advice, love, and healing. Keep in mind, however, the flux of thepsychedelic experience, and do not be surprised if these beings morph readilyinto the opposite of everything that we had considered them the moment before.Entities with fangs, poisonous-looking appendages, and other clearly menacingfeatures usually are not benign, and it is best to be very wary of them. We canlisten to what they have to say, but we ought not to be in any hurry to followtheir advice. On the other hand, strange or frightening entities that seem tounderstand our fears may be more beneficent, particularly if they modify theirbehavior or appearance in response to our anxiety. Even if their appearance andbehavior repel us, more benign entities usually do not force us to do or acceptthings or become angry with us if we do not agree to their requests. Inaddition, we should never make any contract with the beings for doing evil orharm to another person or thing.THE BAD TRIPThough we can try to ensure that we have a smooth session, it is the norm tohave difficult, painful periods in at least part of any major psychedelicexperience. These can range from transient anxiety to prolonged psychosis. Morethan 99 percent of the time in someone medically and psychologically healthy,properly screened, prepared, and supervised, such distressing moments areshort-lived and leave little if any aftermath. Nevertheless, being prepared fordifficult stretches in a session can help us manage them more easily.Anxiety and fear are relatively common as we begin to enter into the psychedelicstate—when we are “coming on” to the drug effect. Simply relaxing physically andmentally—for example, slowing and calming our breathing—is often sufficient todispel these jitters. If we are with a sitter or in a supportive group, we mayask to have someone lay a hand upon us in a nonerotic manner or to hold ourhand. Sometimes placing a blanket over the body or removing uncomfortably heavyclothes or coverings can also help by allowing us to reconnect with our bodies.Once we are in the midst of the experience, we can deal with unpleasant periodsin a variety of ways. The simple breathing or physical contact suggestionsoutlined here can be helpful in refocusing us on the flowing, dynamic nature ofthe experience and can get us out of a rut. More intense or prolonged confusion,anxiety, fear, anger, or grief may require more active intervention, either onour behalf or on the behalf of those with us—that is, the sitter or groupmembers.Quieting the environment—turning off the music, turning down the lights, lyingdown—can be helpful. Such maneuvers allow us to pay attention to what isimportant: our inner state. Soothing interventions may be necessary, however. Awarm or cool compress on the forehead; mild, nonintrusive, and nonsexualmassage; and quiet, melodious humming or singing can help replace the moretumultuous inner workings of our minds with quieter thoughts and visions.For more intense disturbances, there is a range of options: Someone may perhapshave to hug us or even lie on top of us to help us to ground ourselves. A coldshower, ice cubes down the back of our shirt, and other firmly yet gentlyadministered strategies can help break any vicious cycles in which we findourselves. Controlled hyperventilation can also help push us through anyparticularly tenacious disturbing states.Finally, there is the option of using medication to interrupt an especiallyout-of-control situation—but such instances are extraordinarily rare. For manyof us, however, it can be quite reassuring to know that a medication isavailable to pull us out of almost any negative spiral if we are unable to do soourselves. Usually, a benzodiazepine such as alprazolam or lorazepam issufficient, but the sedating side effects of these interventions—which can lastfor hours—must be taken into account. Antipsychotic medications are a lastresort and come with their own host of unpleasant side effects.COMING DOWN AND REINTEGRATINGAfter a trip, we must be kind to ourselves. It's best to allow for one or twodays between a session and resumption of normal, everyday activities. It's alsoimportant to rest, eat healthy food, drink plenty of liquids, and get severalnights of good sleep. Rest. Most of all, we must consider what we justexperienced. After a session, we should write, draw, or record in some way theimages, feelings, ideas, body sensations, and perceptions we contacted. Weshould share and process our experience with others whom we trust: we may sharewith someone who either did or did not join us for our trip; with our sitter; orwith a shaman, minister, or therapist. We must review the aspects of the tripthat continue to draw our attention.GETTING HELPWhile most people can integrate even major psychedelic drug experiencesrelatively well, some sessions—especially our first ones—may be traumatic.Generally, by the time the session is winding down, a well-integrated experienceresolves itself into a sense of happy satisfaction with our session. Intense,unshakable, powerful emotions such as sadness, anxiety, fear, or anger mayforetell unpleasant postsession feelings.Intense or prolonged negative aftereffects may occur, and these can range fromanxiety and depression to psychosis. Added to these potential negative outcomesare the stigma associated with psychedelic drugs and their illegality. Thesefactors make seeking help more problematic. Nevertheless, when we feel we needhelp, we must search for it. If we have taken our trip with others of if we weresupervised by a sitter, it is best to start with them when asking forappropriate referrals for follow-up. Such after-session follow-up may range froman hour or two decompressing with a knowledgeable friend to psychiatrichospitalization. In between these two extremes is the common feeling that wehave confronted issues we are not psychologically or spiritually mature enoughto integrate. We may recognize that a course of inner work must now ensue inorder to use the session optimally and in a healthy way.INTEGRATIONEven after relatively trauma-free sessions, we are faced with a daunting task:What do we do with all this information? It may be a case of “Now for the hardpart . . .” We may ask ourselves if we will trip again, and we may wonder why orhow we will if we choose to try another session. Perhaps most important, we mayask ourselves if we plan to change anything about our lives: our career,relationships, diet, drug use, or religious views or practices. Finally, we mayask whether we have begun a new phase of inner or outer work.It may take awhile for a big trip to fully exert its effects—we need space andtime for the ripples to reach the shore. We may have to live many years to fullydigest and manifest the results of a big journey. It's important to be patientwith ourselves and not to become frustrated that more has not changed in ourlives as a result of what appeared, at the outset, to be a life-changingexperience. More drug trips may not be the answer; perhaps what's necessary is asober, concerted application in our everyday life of what we experienced.Though we should not push ourselves, we also do ourselves a disservice byallowing a trip to be forgotten, filed away in some dusty recesses of our mindsas just one more interesting experience. We must remember that in a psychedelictrip, we've been given a tremendous gift, one that very few people ever have theopportunity to receive and experience."},{"pageContent":"EXPERIENCING PSYCHEDELICS"},{"pageContent":"AYAHUASCA AND THE CONCEPT OF REALITY: ETHNOGRAPHIC, THEORETICAL, ANDEXPERIENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS1 [23_chapter15.html#c15-aft1]BY LUIS EDUARDO LUNA, PH.D., F.L.SWasiwaska, Research Center for the Study of Psychointegrator Plants, VisionaryArt and Consciousness. Florianópolis, Brazil. www.wasiwaska.org[http://www.wasiwaska.org].INTRODUCTIONAyahuasca, a psychotropic preparation created by Upper Amazonian people sincetime immemorial, has been the subject of an increasing number of scientific andpopular publications. Today, thousands of people from many countries and walksof life have had experience with it. Ayahuasca is the Quechua name, widely usedin Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, and to a lesser extent in Brazil, where it hasbeen adopted by religious organizations that refer to the beverage either asSanto Daime or vegetal. It is prepared by brewing the stem of Banisteriopsiscaapi, a vine of the Malpighiaceae family, and the leaves of Psychotria viridis,in the Rubiaceae, locally known as chacruna or chacrona. In Colombia as well asareas of the Ecuadorean Amazon, Diplopterys cabrerana, a vine belonging also tothe Malpighiaceae locally known as chagropanga, is added to B. caapi to preparea beverage (as a cold infusion or as a brew) called yajé (also spelled yagé).Some indigenous groups make a drink of only B. caapi. This plant contains twomain alkaloids, harmine and tetrahydroharmine (some contain traces ofharmaline), while both P. viridis and D. cabrerana contain the powerfulvisionary alkaloid dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which is not orally active wheningested alone due to oxidation by the enzyme MAO (monoamine oxidase) in theliver and gut wall. In the presence of harmine, an MAO inhibitor, DMT crossesthe brain-blood barrier and attaches to 2A and 1A serotonin receptors in thecentral nervous system, causing dramatic perceptual, cognitive, and moodchanges.Ayahuasca (as well as yajé) is thus the creation of Upper Amazonian indigenousgroups, also famous for their discovery of the properties of other plants, suchas those involved in the preparation of curare, a powerful muscle relaxant, andvarious species of rubber essential to the automobile revolution until theintroduction of synthetic rubber in the 1930s. In addition, Amazonian indigenousgroups brought about the domestication of numerous plants, such as tobacco andmany species of palms. The Amazon area is gradually being recognized as havingbeen a center of high culture previous to the European invasion that broughtunimaginable destruction to the whole continent. Within 150 years of theinvasion, around 95 percent of the continent's population had disappeared,mostly due to contagious diseases for which the people had no natural defenses(see for example Mann 2005).Ayahuasca (and yajé) is used within a shamanistic complex by numerous indigenousgroups of the Upper Amazon with various purposes, such as divination, diagnosingillnesses, transformation into animals, or more generally to get in touch withnormally unseen realms subjacent to ordinary reality, including visits to theprimordial time where humans and animals acquired their present shapes. Theconcept of reality among indigenous groups suggests a many-worlds interpretationof the real. Ayahuasca and other sacred plants facilitate access to these otherrealities. Its importance is reflected in the myths of origin. GerardoReichel-Dolmatoff, who worked among Tukanoan indigenous groups of Colombia (alsoliving on the Brazilian side of the border) collected a myth that I present herein a highly condensed form (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975:134-136):The Sun Father is the Master of Yajé. He impregnated a woman who looked at Himthrough the eye. She gave birth to the Yajé vine in the form of a radiant child.When she entered the maloca, or communal house, she asked, “Who is the father ofthis child?” One after the other, several men, the ancestors of the Tukano, said“I am his father,” the first cutting his umbilical cord, others grabbing him byhis fingers, his arms and legs, tearing him into pieces, each getting his ownkinds of yajé. With it, they also got the rules by which to live and otherthings with which to reciprocate: conversations, songs, food, and also evilthings. They found their place, their way of life.Among the Cashinahua and other Pano indigenous groups of Peru and Brazil (whocall Ayahuasca nixi pae), the origin of the vine is in the subaquatic realm.According to Lagrou (2000:33) the ancestor named Yube enters the water world ofhis spiritual kin, the snakes, to marry the beautifully painted snake womanwhose vision had seduced him. He is initiated into taking Ayahuasca, but hefails to resist the fear induced by the visions. He cries out, offending hissnake kin, owners of the brew, and escapes, only to be found and wounded by hisangry kin a year later. Before he dies, he transmits to his people his knowledgeof the brew's preparation and its song.In other groups, the plants from which the beverage is prepared came from thebones, flesh, or blood of mythical beings. Numerous Amazonian indigenous groupsconsider B. caapi, together with tobacco and coca, as highly sacred, one of thegreatest gifts to humanity.Since at least the beginning of the 20th century, Ayahuasca has been adopted bysegments of the mestizo population of Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. In PeruAyahuasca, along with other plants that are often psychotropic, is considered adoctor, a plant-teacher (Luna 1984, 1986). A new phenomenon took place in thestates of Acre and Rondonia, in the Brazilian Amazon. Religious leadersoriginally from the mostly Afro-Brazilian Northeast created religiousorganizations, a mixture of popular Catholicism, in some cases Afro-Brazilianideas, European esotericism, native Amazonian beliefs, and the use of Ayahuascaas a sacrament. There has been a rapid expansion of these religiousorganizations in urban centers of the whole country, and later with offshoots inother Latin American countries, Europe (mostly Holland and Spain), the UnitedStates, and Japan.Consequently, in the last fifteen to twenty years, thousands of people have hadaccess to the Ayahuasca experience, either by traveling to Amazonian countries,mostly Peru, or by joining the rituals of Brazilian religious organizations, orthrough practitioners from various backgrounds that offer Ayahuasca sessions inmany countries. Significant religious syncretism has occurred since its usedepends on cultural setting. A variety of therapeutic methods have also beenincorporated within or around the ritual setting. Experiences are oftenextremely powerful, featuring contact with entities, animal or plant spirits,and journeys to other realms. In Westerners the Ayahuasca ingestion oftenelicits discussions of a philosophical nature, as people try to somehow makesense of their experiences. Many claim that Ayahuasca has been a veritableteacher to them, and it is not uncommon that Ayahuasca is considered as anintelligent being, a mother, grandmother, or grandfather. Such ideas are similarto those found among Amazonian indigenous groups.It is my intention to present here some reflections on the Ayahuasca experiencebased on fieldwork I carried out among some indigenous groups in Colombia andPeru, Peruvian mestizo practitioners, members of Brazilian religiousorganizations as well as among contemporary Westerners from a number ofcountries. I will also draw materials from my contact with other researchers andmy own investigations throughout the years with Ayahuasca.THE ROLE OF AYAHUASCA AMONG INDIGENOUS GROUPSThe Amazon area is not only biologically but also culturally diverse. There arecultural differences between the various indigenous groups of the Upper Amazonin terms of social structure and habitats. There is, for example, a contrastbetween humans living in nutrient-rich vàrzea forests versus those living inrelatively unproductive terra firma forests. There are also commonalities, suchas the institution of shamanism and what has been called animism, the beliefthat nature, including rock and winds, rivers and thunder, is animated andintelligent, and that it is possible to establish a rapport with it. Anothercommon belief is that human beings possess various souls, some of whichtranscend the dissolution of the body and may interact with the living. Certainplants, if taken under certain conditions, facilitate access to normally occultknowledge through altered states of consciousness. These are sacred plants suchas tobacco (especially strong varieties of Nicotiana rustica), coca (there are403 described species of Erythroxylum), Anadenanthera peregrina (locally knownas yopo, paricá, cohoba, and many other vernacular names), Virola species, ofwhich potent psychotropic snuffs are made, and of course the plants involved inthe preparation of yajé and Ayahuasca.Ayahuasca plays an important role in many Upper Amazon societies. Jean Langdon(2000:21), who worked among the Siona of Colombia, points out the centrality ofyajé and its rituals for their notion of well-being and health as well as fortheir acquisition of knowledge about the occult reality. In Siona society, mostnarratives can be characterized as shamanic in the sense that they deal withshamans and/or with experiences in the occult world when dreaming or takingyajé. The Siona universe is characterized by two superimposed realities: “thisside,” everyday reality; and “the other side.” It is composed of five disksarranged hierarchically beginning with the level under the earth and extendingup to the end of the heavens, all populated by entities. Each domain hasspecific sounds, rhythms, music, smells, and colors that can be visited,although these are full of dangers, and the inexperienced can be trapped in theevil spirit domain.Els Lagrou (2000:32) reports that among the Cashinahua of Northwest Brazil andEastern Peru, “Ayahuasca is a means of transport and transformation, a means ofreconnecting with invisible layers of the cosmos, as well as a way of makingpresent the world and stories told in myth through imaginary experience.”Osmani, one of her informants, told her, “You have to remember a myth before youdrink the brew. If you concentrate well on the story, the story and its beingswill appear to you in vision and you will understand the meaning this story hasfor your own life and experiences. You will feel the story. You will live it.”(Ibid. p. 33).This last report is similar to observations made earlier by GerardoReichel-Dolmatoff among the Tukano:Taking yajé is called gahpí irí-inyári (from iri/to drink, inyári/to see), andis interpreted as a return to the cosmic uterus, to the ‘mine,’ to the source ofall things. It has the objective of reaffirming religious faith, through thepersonal experience of seeing with one's own eyes the origin of the Universe andof mankind, together with all supernatural beings. On awakening from the trance,the individual remains convinced of the truth of the religious teachings.”(Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971:174).This idea is related to that of transformation into an animal, a commonshamanistic motive in the Amazon area (as well as in traditional societies allover the world). The shaman is thought to transform into a predator of one ofthe three realms (earth, water, and sky)—jaguar, anaconda, harpy eagle—or intoother animals, in order to perform certain tasks or to experience the worldthrough them, a transformation of identity the Cashinahua referred to as a“change of skin,” a symbolic death (Lagrou 2000:31). This is a radicalepistemological possibility difficult to imagine without direct experience. Iftrue, it would mean alternative consciousness and transpersonal perception ofwhatever is out there, of the “real.”Contemporary members of Brazilian religious organizations that use Ayahuasca asa sacrament exhibit similar ideas. Among members of the UDV (União do Vegetal),one of these organizations, the central doctrine is embedded in certainhistórias, stories or myths, which are recited (not written down) duringrituals, the memorization of which would determine the advancement in theorganizational hierarchy. I participated in some rituals, hearing several timesthe main central myth, the História da Oaska, which in fact is a variation of amyth of origin found among indigenous groups and among mestizo practitioners bywhich the origin of the two plants involved in the preparation comes from thebones and blood (or simply from the grave) of human beings. I was struck at howvividly the story unfolds in the mind while under the effect of the brew, howeasily it would be to believe the myth to be true. Ayahuasca may in factreinforce any religious beliefs, hence its potential for being adopted by otherreligious organizations and as a facilitator of syncretism.Mestizo shamanism in Peru is the result of the syncretism of popularCatholicism, Amazonian, and Andean ideas (as well as some European esotericelements). Furuya (1994) has pointed out the gradual umbandization (fromumbanda, an Afro-Brazilian religion) of CEFLURIS, the largest of the Brazilianreligious organizations that use Ayahuasca under the name Santo Daime.Afro-Brazilian ideas are even more evident among members of Barquinha, anorganization I studied carefully (Luna 1995). They have the concept of“incorporation,” different from “possession” in that the person remainsconscious of his normal self. Members are believed to be able to incorporatefour types of spirits: pretos velhos (old and wise black slaves), caboclos (thespirits of Indians), erés (the spirits of children), and encantados (princes orprincesses “enchanted” or transformed into certain animals). This is close tothe Amazonian idea of transformation. Once while harvesting the vine in theforest with a group from Barquinha, one of the men told me the story about oneof the members that once was gripped by extreme anxiety while harvesting thevine up to about twenty meters above the ground. He solved the problem by“incorporating” the spirit of a preto velho, a black slave, and descended easilyto the ground. This suggests that accessing such states of consciousness mayhave had an evolutionary advantage.SUPERNATURAL ENTITIESShamanism, which implies altered states of consciousness and the activation ofwhat seems as common archetypes beyond ethnic and cultural differences, may havehad a role, as Winkelman suggests, (2010) in the emergence of modern humans.This may have its roots back in ancient primate ritual heritage from ourevolutionary past. Winkelman attempts “to understand the original manifestationof shamanism and the diversity of manifestations of shamanistic phenomenaproduced by social influences on our innate potential for ritual, alterations ofconsciousness, and endogenous healing responses.”Contact with supernatural entities of some sort is documented since UpperPaleolithic time, the so-called therianthropes, part human and part animals,found in rock art of all continents (Hancock 2003:69–93). Lewis-Williams(2005:10) explores the possibility that people from that period “harnessed whatwe call altered states of consciousness to fashion their society and that theyused imagery as a means of establishing and defining social relationships.” Thesame author summarizes thus one of the chapters in his extraordinary research onUpper Paleolithic Art:Most researchers have consistently ignored the full complexity of humanconsciousness and have concentrated on only one slice of it and made that slicethe defining characteristic of what it is to be an anatomically and cognitivelyfully modern human being. Here I examine interaction of mental activity andsocial context: how, I ask, do notions about human experience that are shared bya community impinge on the mental activity of individuals and how does sociallycontrolled access to certain mental states become a foundation for socialdiscrimination?When I was doing fieldwork among the mestizo riverine population of the PeruvianAmazon, I marveled at what seems to me complete sincerity when, for example, afisherman described the mermaids he saw once in the river, or when another manvividly told me of the apparition at night of a frightening huge water snake,the Yakumama. Mermaids, dolphins turning into human beings in order to seduce,bird spirits announcing a death in the family—all are to be expected given theshared notions about human experience of that society. Actual apparitions areusually extraordinary events, often connected with altered states ofconsciousness, the same way that UFO apparitions often are (see Vallee 1969,Hancock 2005). Culture has been, no doubt, a powerful influence in the way weperceive the world and ourselves. It is well-known that anthropologistssometimes are afflicted by the so-called ethno-specific illnesses of the humangroups they study.At the same time this would also explain why Westerners (except children) seldomsee fairies. They are said to live in the forests. Most Westerners live incities, far from nature, and their notions of reality would usually precludethis kind of belief beyond a certain age. I read fairy tales to my mother whenshe was in her deathbed, and I know of psychologists who read those stories tovery old people. The results are often simply extraordinary, as if in this waywe connect with something deep inside us with which we were in touch aschildren.NEW INFORMATIONThere is no doubt that experiences with Ayahuasca and other psychointegrator (aterm coined by Michael Winkelman) plants and substances bring forth not onlyecstatic but also sometimes terrifying emotions. Information may also come fromlong-forgotten or repressed memories. New information may come from suchchannels as de-familiarization, when everything is seen as new, most eloquentlyexpressed by Huxley (1954) in his experiments with mescaline: “I was seeing whatAdam had seen on the morning of his creation—the miracle, moment by moment, ofnaked existence.” This is something I have often experienced, “discovering” newqualities in what was familiar, objects, plants, or human beings. Whenanthropologists have gone to the field, their first notes are invaluable, asthey record what they have seen as new in the societies and the environment isportrayed as seen with greater clarity. As time goes by, what was strangebecomes familiar, and therefore becomes practically invisible. To have thechance of seeing all, in the cosmic sense, once more like “in the beginning” (inmythical times) is a precious gift.When asked about the origin of their body painting, their art, or other productsof their culture, indigenous Amazonian groups often refer to sacred plants. “Wesee this in the visions.” “These are songs we learn from the plant spirits.”“Ayahuasca taught us the right way of living.” Michael E. Brown reports thatamong the Aguaruna of the Alto Río Mayo in Peru:“Men continue to recognize the important role that the visions obtained in theiryouth had in promoting their moral education and physical wellbeing, and inhelping them make the transition to the responsibilities of adult life” (Brown1985:59).According to Lagrou (2000:31) “The cosmic snake Yube has mastered all possibleappearances of form, color and design that can be perceived by human eyes. Allthe phenomena of this world are said to be inscribed in the designs of its skinand can be visualized through the (metaphoric) ingestion of his blood (nawahimi) or his urine (dunuc isun), which are the names of Ayahuasca in ritualsongs.”Among members of the Brazilian religious organizations, the songs sang duringthe rituals are called hymns by those organizations that refer to the sacramentas Santo Daime, or chamadas by members of the UDV (União do Vegetal). Thesesongs are said to have been “received” from the astral plane, not composed bythe founders or their disciples.ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESSConsciousness in general was until recently almost a taboo in academic circles.Roger Penrose (1994:8) states, “A scientific world-view which does notprofoundly come to terms with the problem of conscious minds can have no seriouspretensions of completeness. Consciousness is part of our universe, so anyphysical theory which makes no proper place for it falls fundamentally short ofproviding a genuine description of the world.” Western rational thinking, aspointed out by Frecska (2005), continues to marginalize—and evenpathologize—ASCs (altered states of consciousness), considered deviant states.It is unable to differentiate between disintegrative and integrative forms, andcultivates only the basic state of consciousness. It is unfortunate that thetheme of ASCs is still anathema in most learning centers, even more so intherapeutic practice.In a much-quoted paragraph, William James (1929:378-9) affirms:Our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is butone special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by thefilmiest of screens, there lie potential form of consciousness entirelydifferent. We may go through life without suspecting their existence; but applythe requisite stimulus and at a touch they are there in all their completeness,definite types of mentality that probably somewhere have their field ofapplication and adaptation. No account of the universe in its totality can befinal which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded.[italics mine].The belief in spirits is nearly universal across ages. Shall we just dismiss, inthe name of advanced rational thinking, the existence of other intelligentrealms right here under our noses, only were we able to attune ourselves tothese other realities? Roberts (2006) proposes the idea that our minds functionin many mindbody states. Consequently, he rejects what he calls the “singlestate fallacy”: the erroneous assumption that all worthwhile thinking, behaving,and emotions occur only in our ordinary, awake mindbody state. Could it be,then, that there are mental state-bound realities, only manifested underappropriate circumstances? Traditional societies usually consider the cosmos asmultilayered, normally depicted by anthropologists as worlds above and below amiddle plane representing this reality. Could it also be conceived asmultidimensional from within, depending on the state of consciousness? Is notthis perhaps the reason why ideas, events, and imagery during our dreams (aswell as often in the hypnagogic state previous to falling asleep) lose all theirmeaning immediately after waking, even though apparently our other self, the onein the dream, found no contradiction? Dreams and visions are equated in manycultures. Perhaps visions are a form of conscious dreams. According to Winkelman(2010), the physiological properties of ASC indicate that the visionaryexperiences are produced by the information capacities of the lower brainsystems, and tap in to the dream capacity, an ancient mammalian adaptation forintegrating information in the pre-language symbolic capacity represented in thevisual system.Neurons alone aren't sufficiently complex to explain all brain phenomena andprovide a computational model for thought. Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff(Penrose 1996) propose that consciousness emerges from biophysical processesacting at the subcellular level involving cytoskeletal structures. Consciousnessis attributed to quantum computation in cytoskeletal proteins organized into anetwork of microtubules within the brain's neurons. Ede Frecska (2005) proposesthe existence of a dual foundation of knowledge. The first one would be theordinary, perceptual-cognitive-symbolic, which is neuroaxonally based, iselectrochemical (based on local effects), and relies on sensory perception,cognitive processing, and symbolic (visual, verbal, logical) language. Itperforms modeling, with an implicit split subject-object: it peaks in Westernscientific thinking. The second one is the direct-intuitive-nonlocal, its mediumbeing a subneural network, such as the microtubular network, which connects thewhole body, from head to toe, and based on nonlocal correlations, so small(measured in nanometers) that they are close to quantum physical measures. Thecytoskeletal matrix, with 10 million more units than neurons may be immenseenough to contain holographic information about the whole universe via nonlocalinteraction. It may mediate direct, ineffable experiences without subject-objectsplit. It is perhaps the realm from where shamans and mystics, the masters ofnonlocality, after rigorous training and symbolic death, get their informationand powers when in altered states of consciousness. Thisdirect-intuitive-nonlocal knowledge is perhaps “The Forgotten Knowledge” inWestern civilization, deemed nonexistent by academic Western science.MIND AND MATTERAmong some indigenous groups of the Amazon, there is the idea that people takeAyahuasca not “to see the future” but “to create the future.” Brown (1985:60),who worked among the Aguaruna of Peru, writes: “The future exists as a set ofpossibilities that are given shape by the effort to bring them intoconsciousness within the visionary experience.” Rafael Karsten, who worked amongthe Shuar of Ecuador, writes that in the victory feast, celebrating theacquisition by a warrior of a new arutam spirit by slaying an enemy, both menand women, even half-grown children, take part: all “who want to dream” beingallowed to drink natéma (Ayahuasca). The drinking has a ceremonial characterthroughout. During the victory feast celebration, half a litre of natéma wasdrunk by each person three times followed by vomiting. The participants did noteat or drink before the ceremony nor after they had slept and dreamed. After theceremony the dreamers left the house and remained in shelters in the forest,where they slept until the afternoon. After they woke up, they took a bath inthe river and returned to the house where they told the older Indians what kindof dreams and visions they'd had. The object of the drinking of natéma at thevictory feast was to dream of the house of the slayer and his closest relatives:Surrounded by large and flourishing plantations of manioc and bananas, they seehis domestic animals, his swine and his hens, numerous and fat, etc. At the sametime the persons who have drunk the sacred drink will be purified from impureand disease-bringing matter, and gain strength and ability in their respectivework and occupations. (Karsten 1935:345).Fericgla (2000), who worked much later among the Shuar, reports that when theytake Ayahuasca and have visions referring to their lives, this is because whatthey see is either happening to them, or is about to happen. If they seesomething negative to happen in the future, they take the brew again and try tocorrect it. If they are not able to do so, and they again see the same thing,they look for a shaman stronger than them in order to be able to change whatwould happen. In other words, they have the belief that the visions influencereality.I have witnessed extraordinary synchronicities in this respect happening tocontemporary Westerners. It is as if having a vision had enough power for theuniverse to conspire toward its completion. Perhaps mind and matter are twoapparently contradictory manifestations—like the wave and particle properties oflight—of an underlying ultimate reality. Perhaps consciousness is an essentialpart of reality. It is urgent to have a deep understanding of this paradigm in aworld of increasing environmental degradation, alienation from the naturalworld, and consequently our proneness to violence and/or depression. Whatevermay reconnect us with our past, with nature, and with our inner self is of vitalimportance for our own survival.Shamanism is ultimately about healing in the highest sense, a reintegration ofall levels of existence. Ede Frecska (2008:146-8) suggests an extension of thebiopsychosocial paradigm in contemporary medicine proposed by George Engel(1997), including also the spiritual dimension: therapy sui generis isreintegration in toto on biological, mental, social, and spiritual levels; theidentification with higher realms of reality, with the psyche, with thecommunity, and at the end with an entity above community (i.e., environment,nature, Universe, Mother Earth, etc., depending on culturally determinedworldviews). A process contrary to what has happened to modern humanity who lostfirst the connection with any kind of supernatural world, then got alienatedfrom nature and from his/her community, including the extended family, beingthen reduced to an often depressed individual devoid of their dreams andcreativity. A concept of reality restricted to the measurable material world iscertainly impoverishing.BY WAY OF CONCLUSIONIt is not at all strange that plants with the properties of altering the mindhave been considered sacred by traditional cultures. It is now forty years sincemy first encounter with such a powerful medicine. I have witnessed andparticipated in hundreds of sessions in different settings, and I have been intouch in one way or another with most of the people who have been doing researchon the subject. The most important questions have not been answered. What is thenature of the worlds and the entities one may encounter in such experiences?What is their level of reality? Are they simply “creatures of imagination,” asproposed by Reichel-Dolmatoff (1975:5)? Do they have any kind of reality outsideour own experience? Are certain plants really intelligent and able tocommunicate with us through real “communion” (and even more convincing than isclaimed for the Catholic Eucharist)? Are the supernatural powers residing inthese plants “organic chemical constituents that allow mortal man to communicatethrough visual, auditory and other hallucinations with the spirit world thatcontrols every aspect of man's earthly existence”? (Schultes 1975). Is the brainmore a receptor than the originator of all experience? Are we really able tocommunicate with normally unseen intelligences, perhaps in other dimensions? Arespirits real? Is there a multidimensional ecology of beings? What is therelationship between mind and healing? What about those very common motifs—theserpents, for example? Are they part of our mind, and therefore universal?Under the effects of Ayahuasca and other psychointegrators the mind seems toopen to higher, more comprehensive dimensions. One is confronted in a very realand profound way with the mystery of existence, of life and death and the greatenigma of the relationship between mind and reality. Few people are leftindifferent to such experiences, if done in a respectful, controlled setting andunder the guidance of an experienced facilitator.I would like to present here, as way of illustration, two accounts of recentexperiences I had with Ayahuasca:I see a strange, floating, irregular, nearly transparent bubble with alienorgans. I cannot make sense of it. It comes toward me slowly from the left. Ilet it happen. It stops in front of me. I enter it with my intention, look at itfrom inside with total clarity. I go through it and enter a world of threateningbeings in the shape of brownish intricate surfaces with protruding tentaclesthat go for my forehead. I hum and lift my arms, protecting it. Then from theright, almost out of my visual field, comes another attack. I search for myrattle with eyes closed. To open them would mean defeat. I rattle, blow,hum—they seem unaffected by what I do and persist in their attack. In front ofme I have the perfect perception of three-dimensional space. Tall shapelessbeings, perhaps five of them, occupy the space that expands in front of myclosed eyes. I think of the water from the Sangoma Valley in South Africa, thatwas brought to the house by a friend. My wife had used it on me on a previousoccasion in which I was attacked, with almost instant results. I call Rodolfo, afriend, to bring the bottle that is with my wife.Almost immediately after my request, there is a change in the visions. There islight to my left; the creatures all seem to look toward the light, pointing atsomething to come. There is the feeling of reverence in the strange creatures ofthis world. Is it due to the bottle that is coming? The bottle comes to myhands. I continue with my eyes closed. Open the cork, moisten my fingers, thereis now color, flowers spring out, movement toward the sacred water, almostformless beings rushing toward the moisture that crossed from this reality tothe other world. Then gifts come, like other times, small objects, perhaps somesort of jewelry, nothing I can fully recognize as anything concretecorresponding to my world.The “beings” rush toward me, appearing in several irregular layers. I am in amore familiar territory. I have seen this many times before. I am lessinterested and begin to pay attention to the exterior world. I open my eyes,still seeing forms in the darkness. I am in both worlds, but more here thanthere. Everything is all right. I close again my eyes. I am again in a worldthat seems to be made of a light-brown continuous material, almost like a kindof plastic. I have the feeling of intelligent presence. There seems to be somesort of technology. I think: How could I keep this channel open? How could Ialways get in touch with “them”? As they seem to be ahead of my own time, theyknow what is coming (the principle of divination). The thought of an implantcomes to mind but no; I do not wish anything inside me. I would not allow thisto happen. I think of finding out about lottery numbers, and faintly I see somenumbers appearing but then reject the thought. This is cheap; this is not theway divination should be used, for personal gain. I am taken again by thethought of communication with this other reality. But then I come back, I haveto take care of other people, choose the appropriate music for the moment. Thisreality is calling me now.On another occasion I had the following experience:Even with my eyes open, I can see with dismay, once more, the black ants thatwere almost constant in my visions of some years ago. I close my eyes. Therethey are against a familiar background that seems to be underground. This hasbeen my specialty, the visitation to subterranean worlds. I follow a row of antsgoing somewhere.I notice that without any effort, my mind is following, and I begin to zoom in.I see the ants bigger than any other time before. I continue zooming, or better,zooming is taking place almost without my volition. I get closer and closer tosome sort of nodules that separate small areas from others within that, somehowlightly illuminated organic environment. I get excited. The zooming continues,and I am now seeing tiny organelles that become bigger as I continue gettingcloser and closer. I begin a narrow deep descent, and then suddenly I am in anew place.It is lighter here. I can see everything with total clarity, sharper thaneveryday vision, mediated by the eye anatomy. Round, relatively bright, softlycolored organisms covered by some sort of moving filaments approach me. Thefeeling is good. No danger here. I let them come very close, just a fewcentimeters from my inner eyes. More come behind. I let them also come to justwhat seems as millimeters from my eyes. I have no apprehension. They arecurious. Again, they bring presents. That is at least what I believe they are,as they come with all these objects that I cannot recognize as anythingbelonging to my world.Then something is happening to my left. The attention of all those beings turnstoward something coming from a seashore that I see upside-down as I am lyingdown. I understand I have to get up. I get to my knees, facing a sort of wallwith sort of pre-Columbian anthropomorphic figures. I have the feeling thatthere is a ceremony, and it has to do with me. I am humbled by the situation. Itell them that I do not want anything for myself, but I would like to be able tohelp other people. More than asking to be a healer, I simply ask that healingmay take place through me. Two figures, which I cannot distinguish well, areabove me, carrying some sort of flags, or floating veils. I am struck by howwhen I move my head, the whole perspective changes, as if I was really in athree-dimensional space. If the visions were projected on my vision, the sameimage should follow my head. This is not the case. I can turn around. There isspace all around me.In another experience, I saw what riverine people of the Peruvian Amazon callthe Sachamama, the great serpent of the jungle realm, powerful yet completelyindifferent to my presence. In yet another, I was riding the Yakumama, the greatserpent of the water realm, down to the bottom of a lake. There is often acertain consistency, familiar places that I visit again and again. I know moreor less their geography. In some cases, I get to places and see people who seemto go on with their own business without paying any attention to me. Just onemore tourist, they seem to think. In others, I am welcomed, there is a rapport,they seem eager to meet me. How can I explain such experiences to myself in asatisfactory way?First of all, it is obvious that stories like this are universal. Experienceslike these are deeply ingrained in human physiology. They are part of us. I wassimply experiencing aspects of reality in remarkably similar ways to those ofhuman beings across time and space (Winkelman, personal communication). Thereare plenty of similar contemporary accounts of journeys to other realms withvarious (potentially) psychointegrator agents, including of course Ayahuasca.The Internet is of course an extraordinary source in this respect. Theseextraordinary inner worlds, beyond normal imagination, seem to be too organizedto be disparate constructions of the mind under the effect of alien alkaloids,just hallucinations without any value. The feeling is rather that these plantsand substances are extraordinary tools for the study of consciousness. They maygive access to infinite treasures of beauty and mystery, perhaps to the sourcefrom which all human construction finally emanates.NOTE1 [23_chapter15.html#c15-ft1].

The seminar included seven nightly ceremonies of drinking the junglebrew Ayahuasca, a potion containing DMT and harmaline known to bring strongvisions and communion with the divine.This is an attempt at reporting things that cannot really be put into words.Since many have asked me to send a recollection of my impressions, I am doing soin a form that is somewhat like a travel report. This account also containscontent of the visionary journeys that addresses philosophical and contemporaryissues.But before I begin, a warning and disclaimer is in order: 1. 1. What follows is in no way intended as an incentive to ingest substances that are illegal in most countries.In other words: Be sure to protect yourself against the idiocy of currentlegislation! 1. 2. What follows is entirely my subjective experience and does not claim authority over anyone else's experience.In other words: Be sure to protect yourself from “gurus, methods, and teachers”(Van Morrison), and seek out your own personal experience in a safe setting! 1. 3. What follows is an entirely personal and subjective mixture of highly ecstatic and poetic descriptions mixed with spicy and aggressive criticism of what I believe to be a global misunderstanding of why humanity is here.In other words: Do not read what follows unless you enjoy a good rant and a goodportion of spiritually poetic bliss!Ayahuasca makes us see what's real. This can be something collective and global,and it can also be very much about oneself. One of the many things I was shownagain and again was this:Given my personal history as a former theologian turned clinical psychotherapistand student of shamanic traditions, I have very deeply looked into the endlessdestruction and genocide that religious ideologies and dogma have inflicted uponhuman beings. After having worked with hundreds, if not thousands, of people forabout thirty years now, I have seen how damaged human souls are, how deeplydepressive, meaningless, and prone to exploitation are the lives that many live.Religious dogma is at the root of this epidemic meaninglessness. Behind that isa thirst and cry for love.My past and present prompt me to make no bones about what lies at the core ofthe human soul: the deep longing to experience communion with the divine, to bereceived and loved. I take issue with anything that stands in the way of thiscalling of the human species. I consider it my obligation to do so, simplybecause I have repeatedly and deeply experienced this communion and because Ihave witnessed more than enough of what the lack of this communion does to humanbeings.With these warnings and disclaimers in mind, I enjoy the thought of you readingthe sharing of my ecstasy, of my aggressive rants against the destructive andviolent constructs of religious dogma, against the schizophrenia andsuperstition called “science,” against contemporary legislation, which in itsutter arrogance criminalizes plants that grow from the earth while at the sametime endorsing, promoting, and profiting from lethally dangerous and addictivesubstances such as alcohol, nicotine, etc.These things have to be said. And they cannot be said loudly enough. And Ideeply admire all those who speak their respective truths about these matters.The Brazil report: I want to begin by describing how the fabulous lectures,usually given from about five to seven in the afternoon, kind of set the stagefor the Ayahuasca journeys that began at nine in the evening. It is one thing tomove into the mystery of a shamanic journey, particularly if we're talking aboutthe order of what can be expected with good Ayahuasca. It is yet another when,prior to the actual vision quest, a world authority on shamanism, someone whohas studied the history and has submitted themselves to the shamanicexperience—to my mind, the only credible qualification and trustworthy authorityto speak about such matters—has shared her or his wisdom and thus prepared the“neurological stage” for the journey and its meaning.I consider myself incredibly fortunate having had the opportunity to share thesacred space of such a gathering with a wonderful group of seekers, among whomwere three people who full-heartedly embrace the abovementioned credibility andauthority. Precisely because they do not hide behind theories but base them ontheir own repeated personal experience, I consider these people world teacherswho should be heard and read by as many as possible. One of these folks arguablyis the world's most knowledgeable person on Ayahuasca and South Americanshamanic traditions, the next arguably is the world's most exciting authority onethnopharmacology, and the third arguably is the world's most fascinating experton the hidden mysteries and wisdom of ancient cultures. For reasons of privacy,I do not want to name them here.It is very difficult to put into words the excitement that builds as a precursorto Ayahuasca experiences in such company. It is even more daunting to describewhat transpires during an Ayahuasca ceremony, as it is very different for eachindividual. The experiences I had are therefore entirely subjective and have todo with my personal history, with the way my life is at the moment, and with theway I relate to Spirit and to people.This said, there also are some general qualities to Ayahuasca journeys that aresimilarly experienced by most everyone drinking the brew, for example: * A sometimes extremely challenging and at times very frightening encounter with what shamanism refers to as the “Underworld.” In “modern” and more psychological terms, the Underworld would include dimensions of existential and object-related fears; shadow sides of the human personality; repressed, forgotten, and denied contents of the psyche; as well as collective symbols for the difficult aspects of being human (see the ‘DSM-4’ and the ‘ICD-10’ for psychology's attempt to group and categorize—and severely pathologize—these experiences). All these “energies” can appear in the form of menacing visions of demons and dark forces that at times seem to threaten one's very life. * At other times, the journeyer will experience highly ecstatic phases during the visionary quest, blissful encounters with divine beings waiting to teach the shamanic traveler about her/his life, about how to collaborate with the divine in saving planet Earth, how to change one's life toward supporting and helping all sentient beings, and how to be a happy, spiritual, and compassionate human being.In spite of the fact that magazines such as the Men's Journal should be takencum grano salis, with the proverbial “grain of salt,” there is a very reasonableand interesting, if somewhat brief article in the March 2013 issue (Link:http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/ayahuasca-at-home-an-american-experience-20130215[http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/ayahuasca-at-home-an-american-experience-20130215]).Ayahuasca ceremonies are usually held in a group setting. It is almost uncannyto witness how in a very short time people who have never met before, and whospeak different languages and have grown up in different cultures, bond in adeeply heartfelt way when they journey together. This type of gathering is arole model for community building because it also immediately becomes evidentthat this kind of healthy family has a strong capacity to expose, make visible,and help grow out of, immaturities that we all carry as baggage from ourrespective pasts.Inconceivable depth of healing is possible. Human beings have an almostunlimited potential for ecstasy, love, compassion, support, and reciprocatingnourishment. These strange creatures called humans have been given bodies thathave a capacity to feel the deepest ecstasy, joy, and comfort when touched andcaressed. They have been given souls that can commune with the divine andthereby experience the highest spiritual bliss. They have been given hearts thatcan feel the deepest love. They have been given eyes to behold the breathtakingbeauty of life, of other beings, of nature, of art. They have been given ears tolisten, to share words, and to revel in one of the most beautiful andsoul-inspiring mysteries conceivable: music.How is it, then, that so few of these strange creatures, these earthlings, makeuse of this unbelievable abundance of talent? How is it that so many of themprefer to hunger and lust for power, status, money? Well, because they haveforgotten to regularly thank the universe for the gifts they have been given.Because they have forgotten to hold sacred ceremonies. In simple words: most ofthem have forgotten how to love. This is all of us, guests on planet Earth!My own seven journeys have mainly consisted of deeply blissful and ecstaticcommunion with what I very clearly experience as a feminine energy that I liketo call “Mother Ayahuasca” or “The Goddess.” Hardly ever do I only have ecstaticcommunion without first, or somewhere along the journey, being challenged bybeing shown demons, frightening visions, etc., but the more I learn to trustthat SHE is always working for our best, the more I am able to let myself gothrough these fearful moments and be moved on to ecstatic communion with HERspirit of cosmic wisdom, healing, and revolutionary inner freedom that SHEinfuses me with.There is no question: this is by far the deepest, most profound teaching, andthe greatest adventure that I or any human being, I believe, can submitthemselves to, and the most rewarding one at the same time, right next to a deeplove relationship. I do not have the notes to sing and play the beauty of HER. Ido not have the words to praise the utter devotion I feel toward HER. I live forHER, and SHE has told me many times that I am HER child (as we all are), HERstudent, HER collaborator when it comes to making a contribution to the growthof consciousness and conscientiousness on this planet. There can be no greaterhonor for me. I was saved from sure death several times; I was invited into thehighest heavens several times; I was shown the deepest meaning of what humanexistence is meant to be; I was told how to help preserve our sacred abodeEarth. The questions I ask HER are always answered, either through the words Ihear HER speak during the journey, or through the visions SHE gives me. SHEawakens the poetic nature of the soul. SHE awakens the warrior of the heart.Music is playing throughout the whole journey. For me and many others, musicbecomes “visible” during the ceremonies in a way that is hard to put intowords—rainbow colors shape-shifting into garlands, ornamented with billions ofglittering crystals and jewels, twist and turn around their own axis and explodeinto kaleidoscopic supernovae that dance with every note of the track. Itbecomes visible what Mozart “saw” when he wrote his symphonies. I feel theincredible passion and love of the rock singer putting her soul into a song,having devoted years of hard work practicing her instrument and voice . . .“show your true colors . . . they are beautiful . . . like a rainbow.” On top ofa simple but heavenly composition of guitar music, I hear Terence McKenna speakabout what a shaman is, and I explode into deep longing for divine communion,forever grateful that the Goddess has invited me into HER realms. No greaterecstasy for me to behold.One of the most powerful and moving visions that came to me happened in themiddle of the third journey. It sounds almost pathetic when I put it intowriting: how could a moment that most probably changed the entire course ofhuman history (see the vibrant writing of Graham Hancock, particularly his newbook, War God) appear in a vision of a German person? That doesn't make sense.At least not from a purely rational perspective. However, Ayahuasca does notadhere at all to what we consider rational faculties. It actually couldn't careless. It will just give us what it decides we must see. The challenge, then, isnot so much the reality of the visions; they are way more real than some of thestuff we see through our eyes on any given day shopping for groceries. Thechallenge is to accept that there is more to reality than meets the eye.The vision: I saw the initial encounter between the South American nativepeoples and the first vessel of the Spanish conquistadors reaching the shores ofSouth America. I was alternating back and forth between being two persons: Anative man looking on in awe as the giant wooden ship slowly closed in on thebanks, recollecting the prophecies of my scriptures. And I was a Spanish soldieron the ship looking on in awe as I beheld the abundant beauty of the land andits people. I remember very clearly the feeling of that moment, which lasted forquite some time. It was actually a moment of deep reverence, utter beauty, andendless potential, of mutual admiration and silent communion. And then thelightning of dogma struck: the Spanish soldier remembered what he had come herefor, what he was supposed to carry out as his duty, and the rest is history, asthey say. One of the most brutally violent and destructive genocides in humanhistory ensued. In the name of “god” entire populations were annihilated withina matter of a few years, and in the wake of this disaster, thousands of years ofspiritual wisdom and healing arts were obliterated and lost forever (seeAmerican Holocaust by David E. Stannard). The magnitude, horrifying brutality,and pseudoreligious delusion of this frenzied extermination committed in thename of the “Christian” “god” is beyond anything the human mind can imagine.Since then, the planet has never recovered. In many parts of the world, humanityhas long since fallen prey to the delusional and inflated dogma of monotheisticreligions and their angry and jealous gods that seek revenge against each otherand try to kill whatever is in their way. Their followers to this day do notbelieve what their own scriptures have been trying to teach them for millennia:that there is only one god. Instead, they continue to live in paranoid fear of“other gods”that might threaten theirs, and they wage war on everyone thattriggers this fear.This devastating monotheistic rampage then spread throughout South America. Thereality of a giving, caring, feminine universe that loves its children andprovides for them was lost. The experience that nature is benign, that it mustbe cherished and preserved, that it holds all the healing secrets that humansneed was forgotten. The communion with the Goddess, with the creative principleof a mothering abode—Earth—with a cosmic intelligence is only now beingrediscovered as some of us, scattered across this globe, are privileged enoughto be reintroduced to the ancient wisdom that shamanic traditions have cherishedfor millennia. Some call this emergence the “rise of the divine feminine.”I had the great fortune of being joined in the last two ceremonies by mybeautiful lover and partner. Some say, a “good tripping buddy” can be asimportant as a love relationship. How about if one's own lover and partner isthat good journey companion? Can there be a greater blessing? In one of thejourneys, my lover sang along with the music, and I had to get my ears close toher so that I could drink her voice; it was incredible, this beautiful feminineenergy.The masculine world is so starved for feminine beauty and tenderness, and it haslost the ways to be nourished by it, instead trying, but never succeeding, tofind it in glossy magazines and many other venues that sell women's bodies. Whata teaching to listen to that song being sung into my ears and to see how thefeminine, Shakti, always holds the universe together so that the masculine cando Shiva's dance without getting lost in space, i.e., in the spacy-ness thatfrustrated men lose themselves in: the airheaded and retarded pseudo-masculinespacy-ness of academia, the power-driven madness of politics, the fear-based andfrenzied propagation of ideologies, the spiritually destructive and deluded evilforce of religious dogma. Make no mistake here: these energies have almostcompletely destroyed ancient spiritual wisdom and human sanity.Most of academia is nothing but a pursuit of scientific superstition, theunfounded belief that measuring and reproducing is the only valid means ofacquiring knowledge. That's a fear-based ideology; it has nothing to do withscience.Most established religions are dogmatic constructs serving the purpose of powerand influence of a few leaders who like to oppress and exploit fellow humanbeings; these leaders promote fear-based ideologies, not authentic spiritualcommunion with the divine. Legislation follows and condemns and criminalizeseverything that might truly liberate people. As the notorious Tim Leary has somischievously and beautifully stated: psychedelics cause schizophrenia andparanoia in those that have not used them. Or as the beloved Terence McKenna hadit: psychedelics dissolve boundaries.Behind these stupid endeavors that too many men waste their beautiful potentialfor—and as collateral damage, so to speak, tear the planet to pieces—behindthese activities rings the muffled scream to be held, protected, mothered, andloved by the divine feminine. Like small children, these lost men throw tempertantrums all over the globe, abusing their talents and gifts to gain power,influence, status, and a kind of recognition that leaves them empty at heart andprone to fight for more. To make a blunt statement: Ayahuasca can fix thisschizophrenia. As one of our experts so aptly stated: all political leadersshould be obliged to go through ten Ayahuasca sessions before being admitted tooffice.Really, the deepest thirst of the masculine is to be of service to the feminine,to protect and shield the loved ones, to go out into the world with a powerfulvision and be lovingly welcomed back home, to adore and be blown away by thebeauty of the feminine, to be fully and completely received and be nourishedthat way. Really, the deepest longing of the feminine is to be protected andheld, to be cherished and adored, to support the masculine in its visionarypower, to drink the heart-centered strength of the masculine and be nourishedthat way.Another deeply instructive vision was one that was at times unbearable becauseof its threatening character. An energy of utter darkness and destruction creptinto the overall quality of that particular journey. This was felt by a numberof people as an immediate threat that went against everything that was good,true, and beautiful—an utterly destructive attempt of unknown origin, seeminglybent on annihilation. It was extremely mysterious in that we all felt it hadnothing to do with the life-affirming power of Ayahuasca. Some very deepteaching was afoot.It took quite some time to come to grips with what had happened. Our discussionsafterwards were filled with a sense of deep recognition for the polarity ofexistence. It is difficult to grasp when just told as a story, at times mindboggling or even seemingly crazy, but there was a very acute sense that we hadbeen exposed to the eternal struggle of darkness and light that is being toldabout in all mythologies, all sacred scriptures, and all spiritual teachings. Itwas scary enough, all right, but the subsequent blessing was of such incrediblebeauty and spiritual depth that once again, there was not the slightest trace ofdoubt: to go through this together was well worth it.We emerged feeling that this sister- and brotherhood can weather the storm ofthe assault of evil and emerge with an even stronger resolve to hold on to thelight, to everything we humans know as good, true, and beautiful. Needless tomention, the sense of belonging to each other was acutely felt by everyone. Butwhat's more important was nothing short of miraculous: many felt that by goingthrough this ordeal, we had helped the eternal cause of the very essence ofMother Ayahuasca's teaching, the teaching of all good forces, the teaching ofthe creative principle of the universe: to prioritize our working together atbringing Love, Healing, and Wisdom to this planet.Filled with remaining awe and wonder from that session—and with a clear sensethat we must always be conscious of the reality of these challenging forces—Iwent into the next quest two days later. At some point, I directly asked what Ialways experience as the spirit of “The Goddess” or Mother Ayahuasca. I flat-outposed the question to HER: “What the hell was that?” The reply came asstraightforward and as clear as a bell. SHE said: “Now you know what I'm havingto struggle with all the time, and I need you beautiful and courageous people tohelp me!” I was speechless. I felt so deeply validated as a human being. Inspite of all my frailties, my feelings of powerlessness to make a difference inthis world, in spite of feeling so incredibly small in the face of the magnitudeof destruction that our species visits on this planet, I felt acknowledged andappreciated by the divine in my effort to gain insight and to receive HERteaching by moving into these journeys with HER. It was clear beyond any doubt:this was a calling. The call of the mystic to pursue the path toward the divine,to follow that which brings peace, healing, and love to all sentient beings.I returned from Brazil, acutely aware that I cannot even begin to think that myexperiences can be expressed in words. Believe me . . . what I tried to hint atabove is less than a far cry from what really happened inside. The human soulfinds rest only if it finds a way to fully surrender and open to the divinecommunion. Wise women and men in tribal cultures have preserved the sacred artof holding ceremony and have passed on the wisdom and tools to us so that we cannow study this art and learn what it means to live in harmony with all sentientbeings and with the universe.The tea served was one that made only very few people throw up, yet it's verystrong and spiritually powerful. Volume was freely and individually chosen, soplenty of cautiousness was possible in working toward a level that doesn't scarethe living daylights out of one. Obviously, and as demonstrated by the above, Iconstantly went way beyond that level and did get those daylights scared out ofme, but I knew things to be safe. The learning was incredible. All in all, anexperience I would most emphatically recommend to anyone inclined to innerexploration of depths, provided they seek out a safe setting.Ayahuasca even teaches Buddhism . . . HER comments on the essential wisdom ofthe Buddhist teachings are priceless. But this is yet another story of many thatwill follow. I hope and pray that this experience becomes available to you andthat you'll go and seek it out in a safe surrounding.Namaste"},{"pageContent":"IS ALCOHOL A SPIRIT? OR, MY GOODNESS, MY GUINNESS!BY ROBERT TINDALLThe word spirit, the “animating or vital principle in man and animals,” comes tous via the Latin spiritus, “soul, courage, vigor, breath,” and is related tospirare, “to breathe.” Its plural form, spirits, or a “volatile substance,” isan alchemical idea, and it was only in the 1670s that its usage narrowed to itspresent meaning: “strong alcoholic liquor.”Yet lurking within our modern, dry categorization of strong alcohol as“spirits,” this original sense of animating power remains firmly entrenched.As Shakespeare's Falstaff put it, a good sherris sack “ascends me into thebrain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environit, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, anddelectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the voice, the tongue, which is thebirth, becomes excellent wit.” Not only that, it breathes courage into the soul,it “illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of thislittle kingdom, man, to arm, and then the vital commoners and inland pettyspirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed up withthis retinue, doth any deed of courage, and this valor comes of sherris.”This is the language of spiritual inspiration, not mere infatuation with aphysical effect!Perhaps we should take ourselves at our word. What if alcohol really is aspirit?In a recent interview with Erik Davis on his program Expanding Mind, ourdiscussion turned to the nature of addiction and the healing potential oftraditional, and psychoactive, plant medicines such as Ayahuasca and peyote.To illustrate these plants' mysterious capacity to cleanse us of addictivepatterns, I disclosed an experience I'd had not so long ago, one which ended adecades-long fierce attachment to red wine.Indeed, I loved red wine. Holding a wine glass was like cupping a rosy heart inmy hand, transparent, almost pulsing, catching the light like blood. Ancient,celebrated by song, wine even had its own deity! A good wine tasted of the rootsof the earth, of her fruit, even the sunshine, and its relaxation was, to quotethe Cyclops in Homer's Odyssey, “Ambrosia!”Although I knew full well my life had been fraught with addictive struggle, Ihadn't ended that particular love affair. When I did, it was with a finalitythat will endure until my dying breath.It happened deep in the ocean of an Ayahuasca ceremony. Accompanied by theotherworldly, Asiatic tones of the Shipibo icaros of the Amazon rainforest, Ihad found myself in deep trance, holding my water bottle and praying for thehealth of the waters of our planet: thanking the ocean for giving birth to usand sustaining us, apologizing for our contamination of her precious being.Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of something dark flickering over my rightshoulder. My hand, like a cat's paw, shot back and, seizing whatever it was,thrust it into the water bottle.“Okay,” I said to myself, sitting there bemused in the dark, “I've just gone andtrapped a spirit in my water bottle. Now what do I do?”I directly knew I needed to go outside and toss out the water, dispersing thespirit back to the elements. Getting up, I carefully walked through the crowdedroom, slipped out beneath the stars, and scattered the water.Returning to my seat, charmed, I asked, “Okay, what was that all about?”I then saw it. The dark, flickering thing had been the spirit of red wine, andthe entity had been feeding off of my energy like a succubus. I thought of allthe evenings I had hastened home from a long day of work to relax into the amberred cave of her intoxication, reading my books, disappearing from my family,escorted into a sodden sleep by her liquid embrace. She had been a dark lover.And I was done with her.Returning home, I emptied my house of my stockpiled bottles of organic red wine,and wondered to myself, “How am I going to do this?” I was already aware of ahollow yearning within me, one I would never feed again, left gasping for air inthe dust. I felt a smidgen of dread in my soul. So many years seeking solace inthe opiate embrace of red wine—could that yearning ever fade away?Well, it did. So clean was the excision of the spirit that some nights ago,watching an Italian priest pour himself a well-deserved glass of red wine acrossthe table from me, I felt not a trace of yearning arise in my being.After relating this story, I received this message from a listener to thatepisode of Expanding Mind:I have had a complicated relationship with alcohol for years. Just last night Iwas alone and decided to have some beers while watching hockey. I ended updrinking too much. It hurt my work production today and I decided to go and dosome errands. That's when I heard you talk.Hearing you tell your red wine entity story was the second thing that was hugelyhelpful. The first was that over the weekend I had a powerful dream. I was in abig, old library with the comedian Greg Fitzsimmons, who is sober and in hismid-forties like me. Greg was guiding me through the shelves and we were lookingfor a spirit.At one point, he disappeared and it was just me. I knew the spirit was justaround the corner and suddenly I was terrified. I let out this huge scream thatscared the crap out of my wife. She said it sounded as though I was going toattack something.This dream really rattled me. Then yesterday I didn't plan on drinking but Ijust did. Then I heard your red wine story and I immediately knew that there isa spirit of alcohol that feeds off my energy.Is this so strange? Do we not call distilled alcohol “spirits”? Don't wecelebrate so, from Shakespeare's Falstaff to the Captain Morgan rum ads, where apiratical, intensely colorful, mischievous spirit manifests like a jinni in thecompany of young drinkers at a party?From an indigenous perspective, it isn't odd at all. As anthropologistFrédérique Apffel-Marglin points out, among traditional cultures:Concerted actions between humans and certain nonhumans that have been crucialfor human welfare and carried out over long periods of time have given rise toentities, or rather beings, who embody those concerted actions. For example, thesoil becomes Mama Allpa, a being to whom prayers and offerings are made, who isendowed with understanding, agency and sentience and responds to the actions ofhumans. In modernity the soil has become a “natural resource” bereft of agency,sentience and understanding.1 [25_chapter17.html#c17-aft1]If this has been characteristic and true (the ethnographic records clearlyindicate it is) for human culture for thousands of years, why should we be anexception? Why should alcohol, to whom we do indeed offer up a steady stream ofaddicts' prayers and offerings, not be an entity in its own right?My own innate resistance to this concept, which I presume is shared with most ofmy readers, is actually a product of my own historical conditioning. AsApffel-Marglin points out regarding ancestral practices of making offerings tothe Earth:The Reformers in 16th century Europe called such rituals “magic” due to theirinsistence on the total separation between humans, nonhumans, and the religious,namely a God removed from the material world. For the Reformers, agency, voice,and meaning became exclusively human attributes. Ever since the Reformers'separation between matter and spirit, such rituals of regeneration could only beunderstood as humans representing symbolically or metaphorically the nonhumanswho became passive and silent.2 [25_chapter17.html#c17-aft2]Does not her argument, which applies to all concerted action between human andnonhuman agencies carried out over long periods of time, apply equally well toalcohol? Are we really justified in claiming that all the spiritualmanifestations of alcohol are mere representations of something actually inertand without sentience?For “passive and silent” alcohol is not, not by a long shot.This essay is not, by the way, an argument for a ban on alcohol or any otherconsciousness-altering substance. It's a call to get our relationships straightwith them, which indigenous peoples can teach us a lot about. Whatever our takemay be on the metaphysics of indigenous worldviews, their efficacy isundeniable.Wine with admixtures was once used medicinally in medieval Europe; tobacco andcoca in indigenous cultures are sacred plants that allow us to commune withdivinity and heal; and if I'm ever seriously injured, please give me apreparation from the opium plant! Opium, according to the indigenous ancientGreeks, is sacred, a gift to humanity from Prometheus. I have entire faith inits curative properties.By treating our plant allies with respect and veneration, we protect ourselves.A quick glimpse at any tobacco addict, who believes tobacco a mere “naturalresource” and consumer product, is sufficient to support that argument!Even if not taken in an explicitly sacred context, it's still good to know whatbeing you are communing with. For myself, although my relationship with red wineis sealed, because of the cultural richness and personal significance ofenjoying a glass of stout, I still leave that possibility open for myself.Yet I haven't taken that opportunity in many moons, and I don't know if I everwill again. First, I'll be sussing out how my relationship stands with thatother old friend of mine, that pint of Guinness, once enjoyed in many aconvivial gathering in the local pubs in Connemara, Ireland.NOTES1 [25_chapter17.html#c17-ft1].

Unfortunately as soon as that shit is anywhere other thanin your brain, it's as illegal as heroin or crack.You may be wondering what it is. Well, psychnautical guru and all-aroundinteresting guy Terence McKenna said DMT was the most shocking thing a human canconsume this side of the yawning grave. Coming from a guy who was topsychedelics what Lil Wayne is to “Sizzurp,” this is quite an astonishing claim.Due to its difficulty to get ahold of, some have gone through the work offiguring out how to get this mystical substance from their expanding littleminds. A friend of mine was one of those people. He, like many others, had beenhearing wonderful and sometimes terrifying stories of DMT's transformationalpower. He had read books like The Cosmic Serpent, Supernatural, and DMT: TheSpirit Molecule and watched all kinds of YouTube stuff.By this time, something in him just had to make his first encounter with DMThappen. It's not like you can just score some on a street corner, and it's notexactly an easy thing to casually bring up, so with no other option seeminglyavailable, he did what any resourceful young man would do; he made it himself.Before he knew it, he had the bark he needed from an online source and a recipefrom the Internet. Lo and behold, he had (with some trial and error) the realdeal. After he had made a batch of his own and tried it, he was now on a missionto let other people know about his wild journey through hyperspace.I had come to many of the same conclusions as him about the nature ofconsciousness and spent many nights talking about the mysteries of the world, sowhen he revealed to me that he had figured out how to make DMT, I jumped at thechance to try it.Though he was very excited to share with me (free of charge), he was also verystern that this was not some lighthearted deed. He offered that I take a momentto be at peace with myself and make sure I wasn't going in half-cocked. I tookhis advice and gave it a whirl.Upon first inhalation, I was staring at my bookcase, which now looked like agiant smile with six rows of book-teeth. It smiled at me because “it held somuch wisdom in its mouth.” During this first time, the plants in the room allreached out to me and telepathically told me that they were always there for me.Something was not quite right, though; when I closed my eyes, it looked like Iwas staring at a giant mandala that was ever changing. It also felt like I wason some cosmic swing and needed a push in order to swing higher. There was thisfrustrating feeling of not being all the way there, even though I didn't knowwhere “there” was.I committed to a larger dose of his home-brewed paradigm changer, and off Iwent! This time, everything was left behind, including my sense of self. Infact, self was a laughable concept. While the set of eyes that made up theperceptive character I knew as myself floated in a Technicolor clusterfuck,every digital media I had ever seen in my life spun like a trillion rainbowdervishes and transformed into “people.”I use the term people very lightly—these were like a million-year-advancedspecies of light serpents making love and tangling like earphones in JerryGarcia's pants pocket. Through all of this, they spoke to me in jokes andriddles, telling me the mysteries of the universe in a Fourth of July finale.The illusion of disconnection had been so powerful in my life just momentsbefore, and now it was laughable. Everything and everyone was a mechanical partin a giant machined object; one of love and hate, of all manner of feeling. Itwas amoral; it was loving, it was alien in a way that beggared any Hollywooddepiction of alien.I came back with tears in my eyes having witnessed a wild spectacle that onlythe closed eye can reveal. The potential of the human mind walked into the roomlike an unexpected visit to your home from your favorite movie star.My friend and I suddenly spoke a language of symbol and metaphor, becauseeverything seemed to be exactly that. I understood finally what the mystics ofthe ages saw. No wonder they seemed so otherworldly! They very well may haveseen these things from a natural outburst of DMT in their own system. Religionwas someone else's trip report sadly misunderstood!Two years and many trips later, my life was changed by an experience that my ownbrain holds the key to. Holy shit.This leads us to the question of whether or not it is responsible to even trysuch a thing. I cannot tell other people that this is the be-all and end-all,because it isn't. I can't say that it's advisable to try, but I can say that Ishould be able to make those decisions for myself as an adult. If I'm going tolive and die, I'd like to think it's on my own terms.So is DMT the thinking man's moonshine? It might be. My friend burned a hole inhis floor and stained his toilet purple as Grimace's ass. He set his first batchon fire because he forgot to do some sort of chemical wash before he tried it.Trial and error made mayhem and peril possible as well.Like moonshine, people can make DMT at home, but with no small amount of legalrisk and pharmacological uncertainty. Hopefully, like moonshine, the psychedelichelper known as DMT will become like booze: legal."},{"pageContent":"DMT—THE FINAL FRONTIER: WHAT DO HALLUCINATIONS, ANGELS, ALIENS, DREAMS, ANDNEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES ALL HAVE IN COMMON?BY MIKE ALIVERNIAYour brain on DMT! I believe that it would be hard to disprove the connectionbetween all those words above, in bold print, and the chemical DMT producedwithin each of our brains as the mysterious link at the center of so manymisunderstood moments in human history! Simply stated, our brains functiondifferently in reaction to any chemical. There is no doubt that your reaction toany external form of DMT (either smoked or injected for a shorter but extremelyeffective result, or drank as a simple but serendipitous concoction in the formof an ancient Amazonian brew known as Ayahuasca) allows for your brain toexplode into other realms of consciousness while your heart beats and your bodystays piled in its seat. There is also no doubt that our bodies produce thechemical dimethyltryptamine: DMT http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyltryptamine[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyltryptamine]. Dr. Rick Strassman's almostexclusive, yet extensive work has shown the effects of a DMT “trip” to be mostlikened to reports of near-death experiences, alien abductions, encounters withspiritual beings, or feeling wide awake in the most incredible of dreams.Indeed, our bodies take a required, daily physical and mental break from ourreality that we accept as sleep. During which, I believe there is a mechanismthat releases the appropriate amount of DMT required for your mind to peacefullyenjoy whatever hallucination it can conjure—dreaming in REM. (Does the pinealgland produce or simply regulate the chemical? This seems to be the finalwrangling point for science.http://disinfo.com/2013/05/breakthrough-dmt-found-in-the-pineal-gland-of-live-rats/[http://disinfo.com/2013/05/breakthrough-dmt-found-in-the-pineal-gland-of-live-rats/])With the acceptance that there is no other reasonable definition for what adream is—save a hallucination while your body lies incapacitated—it should benoted that this is the exact state induced by a DMT or Ayahuasca “trip.” One isleft to realize that while we not only don't understand the reasons humans areborn equipped to access a naturally available, nightly neuro, carpet ride, weseem to be ignoring the answer as to how we sail uninhibited in dreamscapesun-mappable, all from the comfort of our down pillow. Recently, I've beenafforded the opportunity to listen in on firsthand, graphic retellings of morethan a handful of hallucinations, a few rare cases of “bipolar 1 with psychoticfeatures” patients have had to endure. More importantly, they were retellings ofthese brave souls trying to survive within the midst of the never-ending wake ofconfusion and fear these prolonged parallels of perception leave behind. It wasduring one of these sessions that I truly had that aha moment, in which I wasflooded with the obvious connections in all of their stories and the work GrahamHancock clearly laid out in “Elves Aliens, Angels, and Ayahuasca”http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qgMFO0KU-I[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qgMFO0KU-I].There was one fact that every story shared, but every patient would naturallygloss over, that struck me as most important. These were altered realities thatwould uncannily occur at night, during a period of high anxiety or manic-inducedinsomnia, or during an unusually difficult night of sleep and were nonethelesseerily similar to the narratives in the relatively recent flux of “alienabductions” and the equally unexplainable “breaks from reality” that medicinecurrently classifies as “schizophrenia.” The resulting altered realities sharestrikingly similar reports of geometric shapes, animals, or creatures that havehumanoid features that usually share animal features or have “otherworldly”characteristics, knowledge, and settings that are far more powerful and/orfrightening than that moment of confusion right before you wake—when you can'tquite put your finger on the fact that you're still dreaming. Let's not forgetthe peculiar pasttime as old as man itself, for those rare individuals with a“more close relationship with God.” Why have they been able to haveface-to-face, seemingly flesh encounters with Angels, have conversations withGod Himself, or put into words divinely inspired wisdom? The vast majority ofthese people have, indeed, induced altered states of consciousness throughmeditation; fasting by deprivation of sleep, food, or water; severe stress ortrauma; eating or drinking “spiritual sustenance”; or otherwise been deemed tobe “special” or “touched.”WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?What makes these human beings enter into states that they perceive to be “notour shared reality”? I purpose it to be quite simple. It is the altering ormalfunctioning of the natural mechanisms we all use to dream while asleep—andfor our soul to escape the body upon its demise. I won't go into my thoughts asto why we are intended and readily equipped to enter into a dream state everysingle night—or why DMT is released at the moment the brain believes the body isdying—here. What I want to get across is that indeed, things that cannotcurrently be explained have a remarkable way of being connected! Whatever thetrigger—be it REM sleep, lack of sleep, extreme anxiety, a malfunctioning of ourbrain's internal regulator, lack of food and water, purposeful deprivation andmeditation, or the introduction of external DMT or psilocybin—the result is thesame. Our brains use all their naturally equipped physical pathways necessaryfor DMT to produce alternate states of perceived realities. How can we begin tounderstand our true purpose here on this planet, with a dualism as perverse as afleeting mortal body, carrying within it a super computer of soft membraneencased in fluid, firing on electricity and chemicals in ways we'd rather ignorethan embrace?WOULD IT BE THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT?If every culture openly partook in spiritual rituals (freely and religiouslypracticed in the Americas from antiquity until the bloody Spanish conquests ofthe 16th century, and surely the lost key used by the ancient Middle Eastern,Indian, and Far Eastern religious originators) of using either plants orchemicals, or fasting and meditation methods for encountering spiritual realmscurrently either feared or deemed to be worthy of only prophets or sick minds,would anything on this earth be the same? I don't know, but I presume such aworldwide movement to be the awakening, rebirth, revival, or revelation so manyhave feared or foreseen.As the ever-churning motor of science's boat keeps us moving forward, in anunfathomable ocean of physics and chemistry, mysticism and magnetism, and thelight of life and the dark of matter, the only things changing are the make andmodel of the engine and the perception of the brain instantly analyzing theimages taken in by the eye peering into the scope placed firmly on “our reality”http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UwvaSLbIgc[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UwvaSLbIgc]. That is to say, wake up! Thefuture is arriving at an exponentially escalating rate. The shift inunderstanding necessary to realize that we have the keys to answer spiritual,religious, esoteric, theosophic, and all other philosophical questions and ideaswith scientific proofs will be as mute in its infancy as Christ's death on across. Just as it took some three hundred years for one man's death in thedesert to show its value in the manifestation of His messianic, cult-basedfollowing becoming His executioner's mandated orthodox, it will take time torelearn what has been oppressed and forgotten to the point of near spiritualextinction. While they don't draw fish in the sand, perhaps there are enoughbrave souls making rifts in the newly (re)constructed and ever-evolving web ofconsciousness that can bring whoever you are now and whoever I was when I wrotethis together to enjoy a fulfilling reality in which we embrace each other forwhat we are. Star-crossed souls, blessed with the chance to experienceeverything our brain and soul, have the ability to access here—knowing love,pain, gain, loss, sharing, and caring in the miraculous manipulation of matterthat is our only chance at this physical life.

In my mind, weed's a bitmore of a hallucinogen than most people like to acknowledge—it just takes a bitmore focus to be used in that capacity and people are lazy. Things like acid andmushrooms come right into your headspace and impose their essence into the veryfiber of your world. They're the only reason I'm writing this weird shit for youtoday. I took mushrooms when I was eighteen and saw a universe of transcendent,shape-shifting, mutant space art that no one will ever be able to explain to mewith conventional thought.One of the more mind-blowing aspects of randomly experimenting with psilocybinas a teenager had to do with reading people like Carlos Castaneda shortlythereafter. Whatever you think about the guy's work, I can absolutely say that Iwas completely unfamiliar with the concept of sorcery or shamanism until thatexposure. Most of us tune it out. I wasn't crazy. People had been basing theirspiritual beliefs on the ritualistic use of entheogens ever since we canremember there being people, and yet, we've outright rejected this philosophy inWestern culture. I just can't figure out why everything's fucked. I just can'tfigure it out.The sensory fireworks of psychedelic high strangeness eventually led me into theeven freakier spectacles of astral projection and chaos magick. I can say withall certainty that these things have led to more coherent cosmic informationaldownloads than psychedelics ever have. Hands down. The psychedelic experience isalmost too powerful. You get a constant invasion stream of more than you cantake, which is why it's so awesome, but it's also easier to process theinformation more effectively in alternate formats like sex ganj-i-tation anddream analysis. It typically takes me months to process a single trip, but therewas a time when I didn't take them so sparingly.The problem is the drug war. Set and setting largely dictate the resultingimprint of any entheogen voyage, and in this day and age, your average teenagerdives into them like they would any other illegal substance. You could arguethat the majority of our spiritual beliefs are backhandedly diluted shamanismwhen you get down to it. This is some powerful shit. And most of us just throwourselves into it as if it's no different than choogling cheap beers and tryingto get laid. I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into when Ifirst tripped out. It was a Friday night—I was looking to party. What happenedchanged me forever. Not many people are going to tell you that's a possibility.The psychedelic experience has never really grown up past its frat boy partyphase in Western culture. I'm still not of the mind that going to a crowdedconcert or festival is the best way to get something profound out of them, ashyper rad as that can be. Optimally, I think sex should be involved, but that'sanother story.What I'm really getting at is that I sort of find psychedelic cultureembarrassing to a certain extent. I remember reading about research done back inthe sixties that indicated that without the implementation of an alternatespiritual practice, the long-term effects of a given acid trip on anindividual's behavior were often negligible. I've known a crap ton of people whohave taken a bunch of psychedelics, and very few of them have adopted any sortof alternative spiritual discipline whatsoever. It usually seems to be about,again, taking drugs as a means to escape life's bullshit and little more. A lotof times, it almost turns into a pissing contest, a sort ofI-can-handle-more-than-you-can competition. Granted, I know a lot of otherpeople who use it to inspire art, and that's a spiritual discipline unto itself,but very few people I've known take on even basic things like regular meditationor intentional dream manipulation. For most casual trippers, it doesn't changethem much at all in the long term. If I were to put a finger on why this is, I'dwager it has something to do with the set and setting in which we take them,which is typically “at a party or party environment” under the impression that“they're just drugs fucking with your head.” That's a pretty good setup for afailure to learn anything. Basically, just edit out all the freaky shit to thebest of your abilities because there's no reason to pay much attention to itanyway. That's the attitude a lot of us are launching ourselves heavenward with.God, the dumb shit I did in my youth. I have multiple stories of being drunk atlike three a.m. at some random party and one of my friends finding acid. Yeah,let's take that, right now, after seventeen beers. It's not like it wasn't fun.I had the free time, and I used to be able to handle these shenanigans. On theother hand, it's also kind of stupid. I knew one girl who took mushrooms and hadto be forcefully evacuated from a concert because she wigged the fuck out. Iknew another guy who on several different occasions ate 'shrooms and wound up ina mental institution not really having any idea how he got there. He lost acouple jobs because of that. Right after high school, I sold a dude some and hewent home and took them by himself. Ended up freaking and his mom took him tothe hospital in the middle of the night to get his stomach pumped. That has tobe one of the worst trips on record, and I still sort of feel bad for sellinghim those. Why doesn't anyone say obvious shit about psychedelic drugs? Why isit always just “Goooooo Teeeaaaam Druuugs!!!!!”?No seriously, I'm about the biggest advocate for the stuff imaginable, but ifsomeone who's never tried them asked, I'd tell them to try weed first. If youcan't handle what that does to your brain (and a lot of people struggle withit), you really have no business going any further. Try smoking pot andmeditating, and if you like that, by all means proceed. If you have apredilection to things like manic depression, schizophrenia, or spontaneousschizophrenic experience, taking acid or mushrooms might just push you way overthe edge, which we've seen time and time again. When you do try them, take asmall dose and wait for a couple hours. If you want more, take more, butincrease the dosage in small increments to test what you can deal with. I so didnot take this advice or think this way when I was younger. Even years back whenI took mushroom chocolates with my wife, who had never done them, I accidentallygave her way too much because I'd never tried that batch and had no idea howstrong they were. As a result, she had a rough first few hours (although shelearned a few things) and I had to put in a bit of effort to pull her out of it,which worked. You'd think I would have figured the protocol out by this point,but it's not like you learn it in schools or on TV. They tell you to party.The other important point is: don't do them all the freaking time. I'm of themind that Timothy Leary's idea that you can take these things weekly withoutfrying your brain is 100 percent off. When I read about the sixties, it neverceases to amaze me how large they went on that front. There is absolutely no waythat wouldn't have made me go all Syd Barrett bat shit—which is quitedepressing, I might point out. And it's not like I've never gone over the edgetripping balls too much like those guys did. When I moved out to Seattle twelveyears ago, I arrived with a half sheet of acid in tow. On top of that, mushroomsjust kept finding me. This of course led to some of the most transcendent sexualexperiences of my life, but eventually an eerie communication startedreverberating through the ether of psychic waves. I kept seeing the exactpatterns repeating themselves over and over again. Nothing new was piercing theveil of novel experience. It wasn't just that, but as with everything telepathy,I was starting to understand that the repeating feedback loop was meant to tellme something, and I'll try and translate it into English for you:Hey, Thad, it's us, the mutating hive-mind super gods. Yeah, we dig you too. Iget that you like making us do this little trick we do, but guess what. We'veshown you everything we can, little guy. Go out and, like, accomplish somethingwith your life before you summon us again. Impress us and we'll impress you.Thanks for leaving us alone until you do.Of course I didn't really listen to all that because back in the day, I wasactually quite a bit denser than I am now, which is hard to believe. I did slowit down a bit, though, but of course I suppose a true lesson had to be impartedfor them to get through to me. That happening took some of my most irresponsibledrug behavior ever. I got promoted into this new management gig where I had tobe on call and carry a pager regularly. The very first night that I had thisresponsibility, I showed up at home, and my girlfriend at the time was cuttingup lines of coke. We bumped those, and then at like two in the morning, decidedwe're going to do the ecstasy we had lying around. That got weird and reallysort of fun and emotional. We talked about a lot of repressed things we'd nevertouched on before. I actually answered a call from my work no problem despitebeing completely out of my head. Then when the E wore off at, like, six in themorning, we had the brilliant idea of taking the last bits of acid we had in thefridge. This is the problem with thinking about psychedelics as party drugs in anutshell.Now, it should be noted that before this happened, we'd done this stuff a fewtimes and it was super weak, which is what influenced the decision. We thoughtit'd just put a perma-grin on our faces, which is what it did before. An hourlater, though, while we were walking around the park, it somehow came on fiercerand more sinister than anything I've ever had creep up on me. The next ten or sohours were the most demonic horror-show invasion-type vibes that have everslipped into my micro-verse. The spirits were fucking pissed. Now the messagewas:Hey, dipshit. We told you! We told you! What the fuck are you doing with yourlife? Jesus Christ, get a fucking hold of yourself. Go out and do something toimpress us or never summon us like this ever again.It was absolutely brutal, and one of, like, only two bad trips I've ever had. Iremember at one point actually having sex with my quite gorgeous girlfriend andjust stopping. I wasn't even into sex. That's how nuts it was. Eventually, shehad the quite brilliant idea of giving me a bunch of Benadryl, which finallyended the ordeal and knocked me out. Thank god no one else paged me. It shouldbe noted that it wasn't nearly as negative a vibe for her and I had way moreexperience with acid at that point.After that, I didn't do hallucinogens at all for like two and half years, and I,you know, actually sort of accomplished some things with my life. I got intomagick. Then next time I took them was again at, like, one in the morning when Iwas sort of drunk with the same girl, who called me out of nowhere. It ended upbeing one of the better trips I've had, and I've actually written about itfairly extensively. The spirits were pleased with me again. There sure is somepotent psilocybin in the Pacific Northwest. The trip started with this kitten ona calendar someone gave me shooting psionic neon-red laser beams out of its eyesand into my eternal structure. Hadn't seen that trick before.In the seven or so years since, I usually embark on one or two cosmic voyages ayear, max. I typically do it to reward myself for some sort of accomplishment,which for me typically involves the completion of an album that Iritualistically listen to. I've been increasingly trying to plan these thingsout and hone the ritualistic element more precisely. This is all new, honestly.I did a 2012 audio acid ritual that quite quickly pointed out to me what thenext step in my magickal evolution is: communion with my Holy Guardian Alien.Abduction basically, but from my body, not of my body. I've got a long way to goas far as mastering that goes, but until then, further figuring out how tomaximize the set and setting of the psychedelic experience is sort of what I'mup to.On that note, part of the reason I'm talking about all this is because I took achocolate and went to the first Hypnotikon psychedelic music festival in 2013.Aces. Just top-shelf psychic residue spewing forth from that camp. I was peakingin the front row while an unholy Night Beats freak-out was going down. Amazing.Like going on a hyper-color great-space roller coaster. Did I gain any real newspiritual insights? Not really, but it certainly was mind blowing in epicproportions. So mind blowing that my head wasn't entirely back to normal forfour whole days afterward. Christ, I'm getting old. It used to take me, like, aday to bounce back from that kind of madness overload. On the other hand, justkind of verifies my point. You probably don't want to be doing this sort ofthing too often, but rather, ritualistically and with respect. The term acidcasualty exists for a reason. Let us not forget that."},{"pageContent":"GIVING UP THE GREEN BITCH: REFLECTIONS ON CANNABIS, AYAHUASCA, AND THE MYSTERYOF PLANT TEACHERSBY GRAHAM HANCOCKI have some personal stuff to share here, and I intend to do so with completeopenness in the hope that my experiences will prove helpful to some, thoughtprovoking to others, and might stir up discussion around issues of consciousnessand cognitive liberty that are often neglected in our society.I'll soon be on my way to Brazil for what has become pretty much an annualpilgrimage to drink the visionary brew known as Ayahuasca, the “vine of souls,”sacred among shamanistic cultures of the Amazon for thousands of years.I'm not doing this for fun, or for recreation. Drinking Ayahuasca is an ordeal.It is, for a start, among the most horrible tastes and smells on the planet—amixture of foot rot, raw sewage, battery acid, sulfur, and just a hint ofchocolate. Within about forty-five minutes of drinking it, you frequently beginto suffer bouts of severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It is not for nothingthat it is also known as “the purge” in the Amazon! And then, alongside thelight and joy and valuable life lessons that are often part of Ayahuascajourneys, there are the sometimes terrifying psychic challenges includingvisionary encounters with seemingly malevolent entities in convincinglyfreestanding parallel realms that can be distressing to say the least.So . . . I'm bracing myself. But I don't feel too much fear because of the deepunderstanding, which has gradually settled on me during the ten years I'veworked with Ayahuasca, that a being of pure and boundless love—who may even bethat being recognized by some ancient cultures as the Mother Goddess of ourplanet—has harnessed the brew in the context of time-honored ceremony to gainaccess to human consciousness and to teach us to do the best we can with theprecious gift of our life on this earth.I know how strange this may sound to those who have never drunk the Amazonianbrew and never encountered “Mother Ayahuasca” in one of her many forms.Moreover—let me be clear—I am not making any empirical claims about the realitystatus of the sorts of experiences I'm talking about here. Perhaps they are all“within the brain,” as skeptics say. Perhaps they are all imaginary (although ifso, we must explain the transpersonal character of these imaginings). Perhapsthey are “just hallucinations.” Or perhaps what is going on here is that ourbrains are transceivers rather than generators of consciousness, in which case,could it be that Ayahuasca temporarily “retunes the receiver wavelength of thebrain,” giving us fleeting access to other levels or dimensions of reality notnormally accessible to our senses? This is a serious question, and one that istaken seriously by increasing numbers of scientists working at the cutting edgeof consciousness studies.But setting aside the unsolved problem of whether Mother Ayahuasca is real ornot, what is interesting is that at the level of phenomenology, many, manypeople have undergone encounters with her during Ayahuasca sessions and have hadtheir behavior and their outlook profoundly changed as a result. Those changesare real even if materialist science would like to reduce the entity whoinspires them to a mere epiphenomenon of disturbed brain activity.Very often this entity (who, I repeat, may or may not be real but is experiencedas real) gives us profound moral lessons in the depths of the Ayahuasca journey.We may be shown episodes from our lives in which we have behaved unkindly orunjustly to others, or been mean-spirited and unloving, or failed to live up toour own potential, and we will be shown these things with absolute clarity andtransparency, with all illusions and excuses stripped away, so we are confrontedwith nothing more or less than the cold, hard truth about ourselves. Suchrevelations can be very painful. Frequently, people cry during Ayahuascasessions because of them. But they bring insight and give us the chance tochange our behavior in the future, to be more nurturing and less toxic, to bemore considerate of others and to be more aware than we were before of theincredible privilege the universe has given us by allowing us to be born in ahuman body—an opportunity for growth and improvement of the soul that weabsolutely must not waste.Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Ayahuasca has been so very successful ingetting people off addictions to harmful hard drugs. For example, Dr. JacquesMabit has for many years been offering heroin and cocaine addicts incrediblyeffective treatments with Ayahuasca at his Takiwasi clinic in Tarapoto, Peru,where they might typically undergo twelve sessions with Ayahuasca in the spaceof a month. See here:http://www.takiwasi.com/docs/arti_ing/ayahuasca_in_treatment_addictions.pdf[http://www.takiwasi.com/docs/arti_ing/ayahuasca_in_treatment_addictions.pdf].A very high proportion of participants have such powerful revelations about theroots of their own problems and behavior during the sessions that they leaveTakiwasi completely free of addiction, often without withdrawal symptoms, andnever resume their habit. The success rate is far better than any of theconventional Western treatments for drug addiction.Likewise in Canada, Dr. Gabor Mate was offering phenomenally successfulAyahuasca healing sessions to his drug-addicted patients before the Canadiangovernment stepped in and stopped his work on the grounds that Ayahuasca itselfis an illegal drug—see here:http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/bc-doctor-agrees-to-stop-using-amazonian-plant-to-treat-addictions/article4250579/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/bc-doctor-agrees-to-stop-using-amazonian-plant-to-treat-addictions/article4250579/].Yes, indeed, Ayahuasca is an illegal drug in the narrow Western definition ofthe term, which allows big pharmaceutical companies to make billions out ofmarketing consciousness-altering substances like Prozac or Ritalin but will sendus to prison for exploring our own consciousness with time-honored sacred plantssuch as those that go into the Ayahuasca brew.The plants concerned, which are simply cooked together with water, are theAyahuasca vine, Banisteriopsis caapi, and a shrub from the coffee family,Psychotria viridis, called chacruna in the Amazon. (Very few other plants arealso known to produce an effective brew, but B. caapi and P. viridis areprobably the most widely used.)The illegal element, contained in the leaves of P. viridis, isdimethyltryptamine (DMT), is arguably the most powerful hallucinogen known toman. Normally in the West, when we encounter DMT, it must be smoked—producing arapid, overwhelming, but short-lived (twelve to fifteen minutes) alteration ofconsciousness, with which there is no negotiation. The smoking route has to betaken because there is an enzyme in our gut called monoamine oxidase thatswitches off DMT on contact. The ancient shamanistic societies of the Amazon,however, have found a workaround for this problem in the form of B. caapi, thevine itself, the other ingredient of the Ayahuasca brew, which it turns out,contains a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that switches off that enzyme in our gutand allows the DMT in the chacruna leaves to be absorbed orally. The result is along, reflective (up to four-hour) visionary journey with which a great deal ofnegotiation is possible and that is very different qualitatively from theintense but brief experience of smoked DMT.How, thousands of years ago, did shamans manage to select these two plants outof the estimated 150,000 different species found in the Amazon and learn tomarry them together with water to produce the extraordinary potion that we knowas Ayahuasca? It is a bit of a mystery, but shamans today claim it was not doneby trial and error. Their ancestors, they say, were taught the secret by spiritbeings as a gift to mankind.Certainly those who have experienced the profound healing of harmful addictionsthat Ayahuasca can bring would agree that the brew is a very special gift. Andon this matter, I speak not only from my knowledge of the research but also frompersonal experience.In my case, the addiction was not to heroin or cocaine but took the form of atwenty-four-year cannabis habit that I began in 1987 at the age of thirty-sevenand that I stopped abruptly at the age of sixty-one after five traumatic—butultimately positive and life changing—Ayahuasca sessions in Brazil in October2011.In what I have to say next, I want to make a number of things extremely clear. 1. I am not putting down or disparaging cannabis or those who choose to use it. The “Green Bitch” in the title of this article is not cannabis itself but the abusive, self-indulgent relationship, entirely my own responsibility, that I had developed with the herb. 2. I recognize that cannabis can be an immensely helpful plant ally and that it has uniquely beneficial medicinal applications. 3. Quite apart from these medicinal properties, I recognize that the sensual qualities of cannabis can also be of great value—enhanced appreciation of food, music, the joys of lovemaking, the wonders of nature, and so on and so forth 4. I believe absolutely and unconditionally that it is the right of adults—an inalienable and fundamental human right—to make sovereign decisions over their own consciousness, including the right to enjoy the effects of cannabis and to benefit from its medicinal properties, should they choose to do so. 5. I remain as strongly opposed as I have ever been to that wicked and evil enterprise called the “war on drugs,” which only serves to empower criminal gangs on the one hand and the worst and most controlling elements of government on the other. My views on this matter have not changed a jot since I wrote the article, “The War on Consciousness,” in 2009 (http://www.grahamhancock.com/features/the-war-on-consciousness.php. [http://www.grahamhancock.com/features/the-war-on-consciousness.php.] ). 6. Last but not least, I fully recognize that I myself benefited greatly from some aspects of my long relationship with cannabis. It lightened me up a lot in all sorts of ways and encouraged me to explore unusual connections between things that I would not normally have connected. I was a current affairs journalist when I was thirty-seven (that was in 1987—I was born in 1950) and I had written some nonfiction books on travel and current affairs issues, but I don't believe I would ever have moved on to writing about ancient mysteries (still nonfiction, although many of my critics would disagree!) if it hadn't been for the new way of thinking that cannabis drew me into.My first investigation of an ancient mystery was The Sign and the Seal: A Questfor the Lost Ark of the Covenant, which I began to research seriously in 1987,shortly after getting into cannabis(http://www.grahamhancock.com/library/sats.php[http://www.grahamhancock.com/library/sats.php]). The Sign and the Seal waspublished in 1992. During the writing of that book, it was my habit to smokecannabis only in the evenings for an hour or two before going to bed, but thingschanged from 1992 onward when I began to work on my next nonfiction historicalmystery Fingerprints of the Gods. This was when I began to smoke cannabis allday long and to experiment with writing while I was stoned. I liked the result,and it soon became my practice to light up my first joint (or pipe if it washash) the moment I sat down at my desk in the morning and then just to carry onsmoking all day long until I went to bed—often in the small hours of themorning. This remained my habit thereafter—smoking continuously from morning tonight, whether writing or not, and gradually seeking out stronger and strongerstrains of the herb.In 2006 or 2007, I switched from combustion products to a Volcano Vaporizer andat the same time began to buy from a grower who has amazing green fingers andproduces incredibly powerful varieties of bud, most usually a variety called“Cheese”—I guess because of the smell—but way stronger than anybody else'sproduct of that name that I have sampled.Cannabis had always exaggerated paranoid tendencies that I probably havealready, but these began to come more and more to the fore from 2007 onward withvery negative effects on my behavior. The worst was that with absolutely noreal-world justification at all, I began to become increasingly jealous andsuspicious of my beloved partner, Santha, who is the most honest and true personI could ever hope to know. We would have increasingly frequent shouting matches,always initiated by me, as I accused her of all sorts of things that she had notdone and would never do. And while part of me knew I was behaving in a more andmore crazy way I couldn't stop the behavior or the feelings that were causingit. We still had happy times, but the jealousy and suspicion kept tighteningtheir grip on me, and I can honestly say that I made Santha's life a miserybetween 2007 and 2011. It is a miracle and a tribute to her goodness of heart,care, and love for me that she didn't simply walk out and leave me but insteadpatiently and tolerantly persisted with me and tried to get me to see sense.So what did those five sessions of Ayahuasca show me in October 2011 that led meabruptly, overnight, to end my cannabis habit? After all, I had already beensmoking cannabis for sixteen years when I first began to drink Ayahuasca in2003, initially as part of the research for my last nonfiction book Supernaturalbut later as a form of regular spiritual work. I drank Ayahuasca at least threetimes a year every year after that—so what changed? What was so different aboutthose sessions in 2011?When I look back on the whole process now, I can see that right from the veryfirst session, Ayahuasca was giving me messages about the need to moderate mycannabis habit and showing me how my obsessional relationship with the herb wasfeeding and empowering negative aspects of my character. What's more, I receivedthose messages loud and clear! But by then, I was already so involved withcannabis, so convinced that I could not live my life without its help, and sosure that all my creativity would dry up and wither if I did not continue tosmoke it, that I simply ignored and blanked out what Ayahuasca was trying totell me. Perhaps if I hadn't done that and had listened carefully instead, Icould have got my relationship with cannabis into some sort of constructivebalance and stayed within the boundaries of responsible use rather thanself-indulgent abuse, and perhaps then I would never have needed to reject theherb completely, as Ayahuasca finally compelled me to do in 2011.The process began on September 30, 2011, just before Santha and I flew down toBrazil. We were in the United States, at a location I won't disclose, where Ismoked a pipe of pure DMT.I had smoked DMT before. My first two experiences, in England in 2004, wereterrifying (for those who are interested, I describe them in my bookSupernatural). Then in 2009, I had three pipes in one night in the same USlocation I found myself in in 2011 and had amazing, healing experiences.Rotating lights moving all over my body, a sense that I was being scanned andthat something was being fixed, some (slightly scary) computer-like circuitrythat seemed to be sentient, an encounter with a sorcerer/magician figure whoopened a rip in the earth for me and showed me an ancient buried city, etc. Itwas all great fun and rather exciting. Same thing happened in 2010—two pipesthat time, separated by about an hour—and more beautiful, healing experiences.So when I found myself back at the same location in the United States in 2011, Ifelt relaxed, and I welcomed what I expected would be another pleasant healingexcursion to the DMT realms. I certainly had no expectation that anythingparticularly disturbing or terrifying would happen to me.Turned out I was wrong.As soon as I took my first long draw, I had the unsettling feeling thatsomething intelligent and not necessarily friendly had leaped into my head fromthe spherical glass pipe. I held in the smoke as long as I could and then tookanother long draw. By now, there was a crackling, buzzing sound in my ears, andI felt utterly overwhelmed and had to lie back at once (I always lie back; noway can I stay sitting up!). Immediately, things were very different (thoughwith some similarities) from all my previous smoked DMT experiences. The firstthing I saw was something like a mandala with an ivory background and intricatebrick-red geometric lines—like tracks—inside it. Between the lines, or tracks,imposed on the ivory background, were a large number of clock faces with weirdhands. I'd seen something like this before, not under smoked DMT, but under avery strong dose of Ayahuasca. It terrified me then, don't know why, and itproceeded to terrify me again. Then I realized that the mandala (only anapproximation; there was something very like computer circuitry about it aswell, or even like one of those toy race-car tracks where little electric carswhiz round and round) was sentient and focused on me. I got a hint of eyes orfeelers. There was something very menacing about the whole scene, and I began tofeel uncomfortable and restless in my body. I had enough of my everydayconsciousness left at that point to wish profoundly that I hadn't smoked thepipe, and I felt myself struggling—uselessly of course—against the effect. ThenI heard an ominous voice, filled with a sort of malicious glee, that said veryclearly, “You're ours now.” And I thought, Shit, yes, I am yours now, not much Ican do about it, but it's only for about ten more minutes and then I'm out ofhere.Since it was pointless to struggle, I resigned myself to the situation andthought, Okay then, get on with it, and immediately the mandala/intelligence andlots of its little helpers (who I felt but cannot describe) were all over me. Ihad the sense that my body was a huge, fat, bloated cocoon and that these beingswere tearing it apart, tearing off lumps of matter and throwing them aside,getting access to the real, hidden me. I was aware that this was a place ofabsolute truth, like the Hall of Maat in the ancient Egyptian tradition, andthat everything about me was known here—every thought, every action, good andbad, throughout my whole life—and the sense that the real hidden me within thecocoon was utterly transparent to these beings and that they were finding mewanting. About as far from being “justified in the judgment”—as the Egyptiantexts put it—as it is possible to be, I realised that therefore I might faceannihilation here. And I heard something like a trumpet blast and a loud voicethat announced, as though this were a proclamation at court: “Now the greatunfolding will begin.” Or possibly: “Now the great transformation will begin.”That was the point where I lost consciousness of the material realm completely,and indeed of everything else. Feeling utterly helpless, utterly in the power ofwhatever process I was going through and of the intelligence that was runningit, I fell into a darkness that seemed to last forever. I have no consciousrecollection of what happened to me in there, only the conviction that it wassomething massive. When I began to come out of it, there were somemoments—though this felt much longer than moments—when I was deeply confused anddisoriented and had absolutely no idea where I was or why I was there. I couldsee the room around me but didn't recognise it, didn't even know it was a roomat first, or even what a room is, and it kept melting back into that otherterrifying reality out of which I was emerging. This has never happened to mewith DMT before—I've always known, even in the depths of the experience, that Iwas having that experience because I had smoked a pipe of DMT and my body was ina specific place, which I did not forget, at a specific time. This wascompletely different and very, very scary.Gradually my eyes began to focus, I remembered I had smoked DMT, and I lookedaround and saw Santha sitting on the edge of the bed, very calm, and incrediblystrong. I was immersed in a wild melting storm of colours, and the only clear,sure thing in the whole place for me was Santha with her amazing strength andbeauty and lines of light emerging from her body and rising up out of her andsurrounding her. I remember falling to my knees on the floor in front of her andtelling her, “I found you again,” or something such (the sense was that I hadknown her in a past life and had found her again in this one) and also tellingher that she is a goddess. I felt shaken but basically happy to be back onplanet normal and was able to witness the sessions of several other participantswithout actually falling apart or melting down.Over the next two days as we left the United States and made the journey toBrazil, I thought quite a lot about what had happened to me and began to feelvery apprehensive. If I had been “theirs” for ten minutes and it had been sooverwhelming, what was it going to be like for me being “theirs” for four hoursat a time in the upcoming Ayahuasca sessions (since DMT is, of course, theprimary active ingredient of Ayahuasca)?Accordingly, on the night of the first session in Brazil (Monday, October 3) Ichickened out and had a (for me) small cup of just 80 mililitres. Nothing muchhappened that night. Just restlessness and annoyance at myself for not taking abigger dose.So on the night of the second session—Wednesday, October 5—I increased the doseto 140 mililitres. The first two hours passed uneventfully and I was thinking,with some relief, that nothing was going to happen. That's when I became awareof a great serpent looking at me. Just the eye filled with wisdom andcompassion. I got the message—“I can work with you but you have to surrender tome.” So I did surrender and in fact said out loud, “I surrender.” Immediately,she was inside me—a huge, very warm, almost hot presence inside my chest. I wasimmobilised, literally pressed down onto the mattress, and felt a tremendousvibrating sensation inside my chest and along my arms, and I thought—Wow! Thisis weird. But I could no longer resist or do anything about it, and the presence(whom I construe as Mother Ayahuasca) worked her way down into my abdomen andthen down to my groin, and then back up again all the way up my trunk, up insidemy chest, into my neck, and finally into my head, where she spent a very longtime. I felt I was in the hands of a great power that was doing stuff with mewhether I liked it or not. I have always trusted Mother Aya, so I didn't feelfear and stayed calm while this was being done to me.Then suddenly the presence left, and I could move again, and I thought, What anamazing blessing Mother Aya has just given me, to work with me for so long, andI felt sure that I had been healed. But just when I was feeling that, I wassuddenly back into the same DMT space that I had gotten lost in in the UnitedStates, and the feeling of calm and healing gave way to terror. I was aware onceagain of an entity (one this time, not many) all over my body, dancing aroundme, filled with malice, and I spent the next half hour or so in utter terror andalso feeling in some way betrayed by Mother Aya—that she had left me in thehands of this, that she had let me be “theirs” again.The third session, I took a low dose and pretty much escaped under the radar.The fourth session, I increased the dose, and Santha also took a larger dose,and we went through an extraordinary series of traumas together. Santha had thesense of some terrible dark being pulling out her heart and saying to her, “I'mgoing to take you to teach Graham a lesson.” She communicated this to me—and Iat this point had the DMT trickster all over me again—and I totally freaked out.I had a massive realization of all the pain I had caused Santha in recent yearsand how this was a black mark on my soul and how I absolutely had to dosomething about it and stop living selfishly and start being a nurturing,loving, giving, and above all trusting presence in her life—otherwise I would bedoomed, and I would doom her too. I was filled with grief and terror that shewould die right there on the mattress beside me. Both of us were sobbing andcrying. Santha grabbed hold of me and said, “Don't let them take me,” and ourshaman came over to help and began singing just an amazingly poignant andbeautiful song, which in due course helped to ground both of us.The next morning in the sharing (a common feature of Ayahuasca sessionsworldwide), I expressed my intent to change my behavior and be a better partnerto Santha in the future, and I said I was determined to change my relationshipwith cannabis. I didn't think it was realistic, after twenty-four years, to giveit up completely, but I resolved to go back to my pre-1992 pattern of onlysmoking at night and never again all day.On the fifth session, after the traumas of the fourth, I took a very small cupof Ayahuasca—less than 50 militres; still, I didn't quite get under the radar. Iwas approached by entities offering me food and drink, but I remembered the ruleexpressed in many ancient cultures that one should never eat food in theUnderworld (witness, for example, the story of Demeter and Persephone), so Irefused and opened my eyes to stop the vision.At the final sharing, I once more expressed my intent to rid my life of alljealousy and suspicion toward my wonderful Santha and to get my relationshipwith cannabis under tight control, smoking only at night, not all day.We flew home on October 14, arriving October 15. It was a very tiring anduncomfortable journey with no legroom and the fasten-seat-belts sign on almostall night. I naturally wanted to comfort myself with a little cannabis when wegot back, so I fired up my Vaporiser and filled a nice fat bag. But as soon as Istarted to smoke it, I began to feel really awful—as though I had a poisonousfog inside my head. Immediate massive paranoia set in, and I felt I was on theedge of going completely insane. I persevered and took a few more puffs, but thefeeling of madness just got worse and worse. Panic and total self-revulsionseized me—things I have never felt before with the herb. The upshot was that Isqueezed out the rest of the vapor in the bag to get rid of it without smokingit and put the Vaporiser away. As I walked upstairs from my office, shudderingwith paranoia, convinced I was going crazy, and disgusted at myself, I suddenlyrealised that my stated intention in Brazil “to change my relationship withcannabis and use less of it” just wasn't enough. It wasn't good enough just touse it less. It hit me with the force of a revelation. I could never smokecannabis again, or I would be doomed. I had become a complete slave to myabusive, seductive relationship with the herb; it had exacerbated the worstaspects of my personality, and my only hope was to give it up completely. Sure,I reasoned, it might be difficult for me to write without it (since for so longit had been inextricably interlinked with my writing life), but I was just goingto have to deal with that.So I have not smoked any more, well over a year has passed, and I remainresolutely determined never to smoke again. I feel free now. Liberated. Asthough a whole new chapter of my life has opened up in front of me. I findmyself enjoying little things I didn't enjoy before, appreciating every momentthat I am not stoned and that my head is clear. It feels great to have a clearhead! My concerns about the effect on my writing have also turned out to becompletely groundless. I had feared I would lose my inspiration without the herbas my muse, but quite the opposite has turned out to be the case. I am buzzingwith new ideas and creativity. Also, I'm much more efficient—writing betweenthree and five times as many words a day as I did before.Last but not least, my crazy jealousy and suspicion of Santha have evaporatedlike a bad dream. I simply don't have those feelings anymore, or the toxicbehavior that used to go with them. We're having lots of fun together and haverediscovered the positive and beautiful basis for our love.As to my soul, I think I've been given another chance—a chance not to be foundwanting in the judgment when death finally comes. I am grabbing that chance withboth hands."},{"pageContent":"SUPERNATURAL"},{"pageContent":"TOWARD AN EXPLORATION OF THE MIND OF A CONQUERED CONTINENT: SACRED PLANTS ANDAMERINDIAN EPISTEMOLOGY1 [31_chapter22.html#c22-aft1]BY LUIS EDUARDO LUNAINTRODUCTIONThe conquest of the Americas by the empires of Europe resulted in the nearlytotal loss of the cultural, technical, and intellectual achievements ofone-third of the population of the world of that time. The Amerindian cropsadopted by the European conquerors spread around the world: corn, potatoes,manioc, tomatoes, pepper, calabash, certain beans, as well as stimulants such ascacao, coca, and tobacco. Yet the advanced technical capabilities of manyAmerindian societies in the fields of astronomy, engineering, medicinal plants,ceramics, weaving, basketry, and—as is becoming increasingly evident—thesophisticated and efficient use of the land, did not have any significant impacton the home countries of the conquerors.Apart from the academic work of relatively small circles of historians,ethnologists, and anthropologists and the obscure accounts of travelers, therewas no European acknowledgment of a single philosophical idea from the people ofthe Americas prior to the recently awakened interest in Amerindian shamanism.2[31_chapter22.html#c22-aft2] There was no technical or philosophical/theologicalexchange between the peoples of the two continents. Europeans viewed theAmerindian population as objects of conversion, assimilation, subjugation, orannihilation.The sacred books of the Maya were burned in 1562. The quipus of the Andes—a workof the Devil according to 16th-century friars—were destroyed by a decree in1583.3 [31_chapter22.html#c22-aft3] The sacred groves, temples, and places ofworship of the Amerindians were desecrated. Revered works of art were melteddown for the price of their gold. The repository of Amerindian traditions, thebearers of wisdom who “remembered” and knew “how to speak,” were hunted andkilled. Their knowledge was treated as the work of Satan, still today a powerfularchetypical figure in both the Christian and Islamic worlds.It was the obliteration of the wonderings about the nature of reality of a wholecontinent with the transplantation into the Americas of an Indo-Europeansyndrome that, according to Gimbutas (1989), had already destroyed the spiritualmanifestations of European Neolithic cultures, the “Old Europe,” largelyassociated with the natural environment. At the time of the arrival of theEuropean conquerors, the “Old World” for a long time had been engulfed inideological religious wars in which deviation from pronounced dogmas could bepunished with death.4 [31_chapter22.html#c22-aft4]All of this went hand in hand with deforestation, a development that in the Westgoes back to Greco-Roman times, if not even further back in time to the fear offorests: it can be traced to the Mesopotamian myth of Gilgamesh, the first heroin world literature, who embarked on a quest to kill Humbaba, the demon of theforest, who lived in the mountainside cedar groves harvested to the last by theancient Sumerians (Harrison 1992).5 [31_chapter22.html#c22-aft5]The deforestation of Europe was carried out in the interests of agriculture; theconversion to grasslands for the grazing horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigsto satisfy an insatiable appetite for meat and milk; the construction of houses,palaces, fortresses, boats, and weapons, and for strategic or religious reasons.The Americas are still being subjected to the kind of devastating deforestationthat already by the time of the conquest of America had decimated the forests ofmuch of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.6 [31_chapter22.html#c22-aft6]Domesticated plants and animals from Eurasia accompanied the conquest of theAmericas, destroying much of the original biota, a phenomenon referred to byCrosby (1986) as “ecological imperialism.” At the same time, the indigenouspopulation was condemned to humiliation, subjugation, and poverty, barelysurviving history's greatest ethnocide. Almost by a miracle after five hundredyears of persecution, one aspect of Amerindian cosmology did survive, althoughin an attenuated form: shamanism.SHAMANISM IN THE AMERICASThe term shamanism is used here to refer to an innate human capacity, culturallymanifested in various ways, which include several universal elements: alteredstates of consciousness (ASC), community rituals, spirit world interaction, andhealing (Winkelman 1992, 2010). The ASC produce a cognitive and personaltransformation by means of various techniques used to enter into an “integrativemode of consciousness” (Winkelman 1996, 2010), which include sensory overload orsensory deprivation, drumming, chanting, fasting, isolation, meditation, andhyperventilation. Both in the past as well as in the present, numerous examplescan be found of the use of psychotropic plants, often in combination with one ormore of the other techniques.The cognitive changes thus achieved may involve journeying to complex,stratified, and interconnected worlds perceived as ontologically real, andcontacting entities often related to the natural environment, such as animalspirits, or the spirits of the dead. These changes may involve a symbolic deathor experiencing a transformation into an animal such as a bird or a powerfulpredator to visit specific realms or to better perform a certain task.Understood in this sense, shamanism entails a socially recognized status thatincludes the possibility of certain individuals being able to heal, cause harms,prophesize, mediate in situations of social conflict, or obtain leadershipcapacities by means of the knowledge and power acquired by such techniques andsupernatural contacts.Shamanism was of central importance in the Americas prior to the arrival of theEuropeans and still plays a central role among contemporary indigenous groups aswell as among certain segments of the mestizo population. Its ethnography hasbeen extensively and widely documented.When examined from the perspectives of the shamanic paradigm, much of the artleft behind by pre-Columbian societies as well as specific paraphernalia, pointin this direction. The archaeological record suggests that shamanism may haveoften been intimately associated with the use of certain plants, usuallyconsidered as sacred, and as proposed by Winkelman, now known aspsychointegrator plants.Winkelman (1996, 2010) uses the concept of psychointegrator plants and therelated concept of integrative modes of consciousness to postulate that theyreflect not only what happens at the level of the self but also at thebiological level, manifested in theta wave synchronization, i.e., at three tosix cycles per second. The Winkelman model posits an accessing of informationfrom the lower levels of the brain, the brain stem or reptilian brain thatregulates vegetative processes such as breathing, heartbeat, and thefight-or-flight mechanism as well as accessing the paleomammalian brain orlimbic system that supports functions such as emotion, behavior, long-termmemory, and olfaction. Winkelman suggests that in this way, the information thatis normally habituated or relegated to the subconscious is made availablethrough a reverse inhibitory process.In addition, Winkelman posits that at the physiological level, psychointegratorplants and substances enhance the way the serotonin system functions, modulatingand integrating information within the brain. They also inhibit very specificmechanisms, releasing certain dopamine-related capacities of the brain normallyrepressed by serotonin, and consequently enhancing the functioning of thedopaminergic system, which is fundamental to motivational and learning processesof the brain.Winkelman uses the concept of psychointegrator plants to refer to experiential,phenomenological, or psychological aspects of their physiological effects. Hesuggests that the resulting mentation (how you think) and emotion (how you feel)may produce a holistic state of psychological integration and emotional growth.Some of the alkaloids found in psychointegrator plants are surprisingly similarto human brain neurotransmitters, reflecting adaptations made by human ancestorsin the course of evolutionary processes. Psychointegrator plants aretraditionally used across cultures in a religious, spiritual, and oftentherapeutic context and may enhance some of the innate capacities ofconsciousness, integrating various forms of information. They seem to enhancethe innate capacities of human beings for spiritual experiences as well as thepresentiment of spirits embodied in nature.The standard Eurocentric worldview has no place for the powerful cognitivetransformation facilitated by psychointegrators. For this reason, the typicalinhabitant of a Eurocentric worldview is unable to make any sense of examples ofAmerindian art such as the extraordinary Tolita ceramic from Ecuador shown inFigure 1 (Klein & Cruz 2007). In Europe, prior to the advent of modern art,there were few representations of the cognitive changes such as of bodyperception, of the disintegration of the self, or of the perception ofnonnatural entities that may be produced by psychointegrators. But onceshamanism and integrative states of consciousness are taken into account, agreat deal of Amerindian art begins to make sense.A case in point is the pioneering work of the “Father of Colombian Anthropology”Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff and his study of the pre-Columbian gold work in theGold Museum in Bogotá (1988). He argues that by recognizing the relationshipbetween ritual objects and the subjacent shamanic ideology, a deepersignificance is revealed. In fact, the greater part of the figurativerepresentations constitutes a consistent and articulated complex of shamanicart, with transformation as the unifying theme (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1988). Hecontends that much of the artwork preserved can be explained in terms of theshamanic paradigm. Certain iconographic elements may serve to identifyparticular figures as shamans, such as special headdresses, specific postures,rattles, and more significant representations of animal transformation orjourneys by means of animal auxiliaries.Image [images/p225-01.jpg]Figure 1: Tolita ceramic, EcuadorImage [images/p225-02.jpg]Figures 2: Pre-Columbian gold workThe ritual objects include several golden snuff trays from the territory of theMuisca people in the central highlands of present-day Colombia. The snuff trays,decorated with felines and birds commonly associated with shamanism, were onceused for the storage of small amounts of the highly psychoactive powder obtainedfrom the crushed roasted seeds of Anadenanthera peregrina. The ritual objectsalso include golden poporos once used for the storage of small amounts of limeas well as poporo sticks once used in the consumption of coca—the poporo sticksare topped with tiny and complex heads with apparent shamanic motifs.Representations of birds or winged objects are also predominant in the goldwork.Reichel-Dolmatoff suggests that the winged motif is connected with the shamanicsphere and is a conscious or unconscious allusion to shamanic flight. In manyinstances he recognizes, in different styles and variations, the figures as thatof a shaman transformed into a bird, a “bird-man” (two examples fromReichel-Dolmatoff 1988). There are also highly abstract examples of goldwork,which are variations of the birdman motif, once the basic elements arerecognized.Effigies of various animals—sometimes of a fantastic, nonnaturalisticnature—sometimes accompany the central figure, which the author interprets asanimal auxiliaries perhaps representing qualities such as sharpness of sight orhearing, aggressiveness, the ability to undergo metamorphosis, etc. Theincorporation of animal qualities—in its more radical form being completetransformation into an animal—or the transference of those qualities to theirpatients being one of the characteristics of shamans in many cultures (Luna1992).Reichel-Dolmatoff also presents examples of golden figurines with a toad spreadon the head of the central figure, perhaps a reference to Bufo marinus, whoseparotid glands produce bufotenine, a psychoactive alkaloid, as well as figurinesin which semispherical bodies appear on the head, possibly a reference topsychoactive mushrooms according to Schultes and Bright (1979). In some of thesefigures, both elements appear.The goldwork preserved at the Museo del Oro is thus for Reichel-Dolmatoff “atreasure of shamanic art, a treasure of forms and ideas which for thousands ofyears have constituted one of the cornerstones of the Indian cultures of thiscountry,” and the bird-man, the ecstatic shaman, one of its key symbols.Rebecca R. Stone in The Jaguar Within: Shamanic Trance in Ancient Central andSouth American Art examines what she calls “shamanic embodiment,” which may beartistically expressed along a continuum that may go from predominantly human tocreative mixtures embedding animal selves to images almost wholly given over tothe ineffable. She argues that in order to represent a shaman, a liminal beingwho is both Here and Not-Here, there is a deliberate engagement with ambiguity,perhaps the essential feature of shamanism, which “productively fires theartistic imagination, catalyzing inventive ways to express the ineffable cosmicflux,” and using such strategies as “juxtaposition, conflation, substitution ofparts, pars pro toto (the part stands for the whole), inversion, double reading(through contour rivalry, figure-ground reversal, and three-dimensional versustwo-dimensional aspects), mirror-imaging, abstraction, and interiority” (Stone2011:67).Among the myriad possible artistic approaches to the paradoxes intrinsic toembodying of the shamanic Self, she proposes four general traits: creativeambiguity, authority, cephalocentrism, and the trance gaze. By way of evidence,she cites examples of ancient Costa Rican and Central Andean art, at the sametime pointing to the possibility of subjecting thousands of works of art fromall over Central and South America to a similar analysis making use of theconcepts she has presented.Stone's compelling and encompassing well-crafted argumentation is impossible toencapsulate in a few paragraphs. Here are some ideas I found particularlyattractive. How can the artist through colors, shapes, and lines in a staticimage capture the flux of liminality, of existing somewhere suspended betweenstates of being, of true multiplicity in the Self? Amerindian art gives aplethora of solutions. The artists, without the constraints of an artisticmandate to reproduce terrestrial appearances, have as their goal therecorporealization of the shaman, something that entails a decorporealization,just as does the visionary experience, and then the rebuilding of a differentidea of a spirit-body as a holder for the being in trance. The visionaryexperience, on the other hand, requires a participation in a convincinglynonhumancentered gestalt of all nature infused with life and obviates the needto make hard-edged visual distinctions between a person and a bat or a peanutand a divine being. The artist is able to throw aside discrete categories andmimetic attachments to this world and its static constituents by exploringpossibilities beyond how things look under normal conditions, creatingcombinations that defy description. The Western worldview limits ourunderstanding of such art objects because seemingly neutral terms such as image,depiction, and representation inevitably communicate the opposite of theshamanic approach to the object. Amerindian artists, on the other hand, “embracecreative ambiguity.” Stone proposes that the object we call an effigy of ashaman served as both a visual rendition of the shaman's many selves and as oneof the shaman's subjective selves.We may infer that seen as a whole, totally unrecognized by most people,pre-Columbian art is full of allusions to unseen realms, shamanictransformation, subjective states, and alternative modes of cognition. One ofthe most common themes is the jaguar transformation. The human/feline motif isfound in South America from the earliest cultures, such as in Caral (ca. 4,600B.P.) in coastal Peru. The idea that shamans are able to transform into jaguarsis widespread even today in the Amazon, as shown by Reichel-Dolmatoff (1975) inhis monograph on this subject. Transformation into other animals, such asserpent, harpy eagle, or whatever animal it would be necessary to acquirecertain qualities or cognitive abilities is also believed to be possible.Therianthropes, a composite of human and animal, sometimes of several of them,as well as many other motifs expressing various inner states are thus common inAmerindian iconography. Therianthropes may be either a representation ofentities acquiring anthropomorphic features in order to communicate with humancounterparts, or an expression of a subjective perceptional mode in which thehuman acquires animal qualities. These images would instantly evoke inAmerindian people particular cognitive states related to multidimensional,multilayered cosmologies, spaces in the mind (perhaps the perception ofalternate realities) nowadays mostly forgotten but once visited by the ancestorsof all of us, as may be deduced from numerous examples of Paleolithic rock art(Clottes & Lewis-Williams 1998; Lewis-Williams 2002; Hancock 2005).PSYCHOINTEGRATOR PLANTSThroughout the Americas in the past and in some places still today, shamanismhas gone hand in hand with the use of psychointegrator plants. The best knownare peyote (Lophophora williamsi) and psilocybin mushrooms in Mesoamerica;several species of Brugmansia, Anadenanthera colubrina, and Anadenantheraperegrina in South America (also introduced in pre-Columbian times in theCaribbean); the various San Pedro cacti (Trichocereus pachanoi and otherTrichocereus species) in Andean and coastal areas of Peru; Ayahuasca(Banisteriopsis caapi with Psychotria viridis) and yajé (B. caapi withDiplopterys cabrerana) in the Upper Amazon; and of course tobacco, sacred in thewhole of the Americas. In more restrictive areas, many other psychotropic plantswere or are still used.According to Alicia Fernández Distel (1980), A. colubrina was already being usedin Inca Cueva, Puna de Jujuy, Argentina, around 2100 BCE. It played a centralrole in the extraordinary Tiwanaku culture, from roughly 300 to 1000 AD, asevidenced in representations of snuff paraphernalia in monoliths and theubiquity of snuff kits, including tablets, inhalators, spoons, and pouches withpowder from seeds of this plant, conserved in San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, anarea heavily influenced by the Tiwanaku culture (Torres & Rebke 2006; seefigures 3–4, courtesy of C. M. Torres).According to Gordon Francis McEwan (2001:197) prehistoric agricultural groupsassociated with the Saladoid tradition (ca. 5300–2000 BCE) transplanted A.colubrina into the West Indies from the Orinoco valley, reaching Puerto Rico by2300–2000 BCE. Several pre-Columbian mortars from the Amazon area probablyassociated with the use of cohoba or yopo have been preserved (McEwan 2001). Theuse of A. peregrina was witnessed during his second trip (1497–98) to theAmericas by Columbus, who had the Catalonian friar Ramón Pané document its usein the very first book written in the Americas in a European language.7[31_chapter22.html#c22-aft7]The oldest evidence of the use of Trichocereus pachanoi dates from around2000–1500 BCE in Las Aldas on the north-central coast of Peru (Fung 1972; PoliaMeconi 1996: 289). The San Pedro cactus played a central role in Chavin culturein the northern Andean highlands of Peru, as evidenced in figures from thereligious and political center of Chavin de Huántar (900–200 BCE, see Figure 5)as well as from Nazca (100 BCE to 700 AD).The oldest known dates for tobacco are from the north coast of Peru, with datesranging between 2500 and 1800 BCE (Pearsall, 1992: 178). Coca chewing innorthern Peru began in at least 6000 BCE (Dillehay et al. 2010).PRE-COLUMBIAN AMAZONCompared to the extraordinary cultures found in coastal Peru, the Andes, andMesoamerica, until recently the pre-Columbian Amazon area was considered to bedevoid of high culture. It is now clear that human beings were living in theAmazon area at least twelve thousand years ago or even longer (Roosevelt 1994).The oldest ceramics in South America, from 5080 BCE, were found in Taperinha,near Santarem, in the Brazilian Amazon area (Roosevelt et al. 1991). Severalagricultural centers have been localized in the Amazon area, perhaps independentof those where agriculture was autonomously originated in the Americas(Mesoamerica, the Andes, and eastern North America). Archaeologists such asClark L. Erikson, William L. Balée, Michael Heckenberger, Eduardo Neves, AugustoOyuela-Caycedo, and others are changing our ideas of the pre-Columbian Amazonwith the discovery of the vast manmade channels, raised fields, mounds, andforest islands connected by earthen causeways in various parts of the Amazon,and the existence over large areas of the so-called terra preta do indio(Amazonian Dark Earths), or manmade soils of the highest quality, and at timestwo meters deep in areas where natural soils are no more than a few centimeters,as well as large orchards of semidomesticated fruit trees (see, for example,Woods et al. 2009). In Acre, Brazil, a large number of geoglyphs, geometricearthworks, have been localized (Schaan et al.) and a large circle of granitestones found in Calçoene, near Macapá, in Amapá state, also in Brazil, datingback to between 700 AD and 1000 AD suggest a knowledge of astronomy.Image [images/p229-01.jpg]Figure 3: Paraphernalia from San Pedro de Atacama (Courtesy C.

M. Torres)The indications of large sedentary populations, perhaps in the millions, andlevels of civilization much higher and complex than previously thought, lendcredence to the picture painted in 1542 by Friar Gaspar de Carvajal in hischronicle of the odyssey of Francisco de Orellana and his men, the firstEuropeans to travel down the Amazon River from the Napo River to the AtlanticOcean. Carvajal wrote of great “capitanías,” large human settlements on bothsides of the river, and of extraordinary ceramic work, “the best in the world”even “better than then of Málaga.”It is difficult to imagine the kind of cultures that occupied this vast area,given the cataclysmic decimation of up to 95 percent of the populationthroughout the Americas following European contact (Stannard 1992). In 1634,Acuña still talked about myriads of people living along the rivers andcultivating soils of great fertility. Nearly one hundred years later,Charles-Marie de La Condamine reported on his journey into the Amazon, whichstarted in 1743, that the area was to a great extent empty. The most probablecause was the diseases brought by the European conquerors.The material culture of the inhabitants of the Amazon of today and probably evenmore so of the Amazon of the distant past is based on a sophisticated use ofplant material. The inhabitants have proved to possess a great knowledge ofedible, venomous, medicinal, and psychoactive plants. Amazonian Indiansdiscovered the properties of latex from the Hebea genus, the source of rubber:the rubber boom in 1850 to 1914, which was to become a pillar of the automobileand weapon industries, resulted in the enslavement of local populations; asimilar havoc was also suffered by the local populations in the Congo FreeState, the personal fiefdom of the ill-famed King Leopold II of Belgium. Quininefrom the bark of Ecuadorian cinchona trees was used until the 1940s in thetreatment of malaria. Plants containing curare have not only been used forvarious types of arrow poisons but have also been vital for the development ofthe techniques of open heart, radical brain, and craniofacial surgery as well asorgan transplants.The people of the Amazon live in one of the areas of largest biodiversity on theplanet. It is becoming increasingly evident that the biodiversity of the Amazonis to a great extent the result of the natural resource management of thepre-Columbian people of the Amazon. Some of this knowledge is still preservedtoday by the Cayapó of the Brazilian Amazon, who demonstrate a greatunderstanding of ecosystems, plant and animal species association, insect-plantinteraction, as well as sophisticated soil taxonomy (Posey 1984, 1991, Posey etal. 1989). The Cayapó have been credited with the creation of forest islands onmostly savanna covered territories, with the recognition of marginal or openspots within the forest that have micro-environmental conditions similar tothose in the savannah, as well as with the exchange and spread of useful speciesbetween ecological zones through the transplantation of seeds, cuttings, tubers,and saplings (Posey 1984, 1991, Posey et al. 1989).To a certain extent, the Amazon is an anthropogenic forest, a gigantic gardenpartially created by human beings through millennia of interaction with thenatural environment.THE AYAHUASCA/YAJÉ COMPLEX IN THE UPPER AMAZONThe knowledge of the people of the Amazon of what may be called the pharmacologyof consciousness needs perforce to be placed within the context of such asophisticated high culture.Snuffs made from the seeds of A. peregrina or from the sap of Virola theiodora,are still used today to induce altered states of consciousness. Variousindigenous groups of Colombia and some areas of the Ecuadorian Amazon as well asindigenous groups belonging to several linguistic families in the Upper Amazonstill today use the pounded stem of the vine B. caapi, often in combination withDiplopterys cabrerana, a vine in the same family (Malpighiaceae), either as acold infusion or as a decoction called yajé (also spelled yagé). In other areasof Ecuador, as well as the Peruvian, Bolivian, and Brazilian Amazon, indigenousgroups use the stem of B. caapi in combination with the leaves of P. viridis(Rubiaceae), usually as a decoction, under the Quechua name Ayahuasca (alsospelled ayawaska). There are other vernacular names for both yajé and Ayahuasca.There is no clear evidence of the earlier use of either of these plantpreparations beyond the statements by 18th-century missionaries, who consideredthe preparations to be agents of the Devil. However, given the antiquity of theuse of other psychotropic plants, it seems unlikely that yajé or Ayahuasca is arelatively recent innovation. It is little more than speculation to claim thatknowing how to prepare yajé or Ayahuasca derives from some kind of higherpsychopharmacological knowledge of indigenous Amazonians. But what is beyondspeculation is that the preparation of yajé or Ayahuasca requires the mastery ofa sophisticated technique.D. cabrerana and P. viridis contain the alkaloid DMT (dimethyltryptamine), whichis orally inactive due to its degradation by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) presentin the human gut and liver. The MAO-inhibitor harmine in B. caapi protects theDMT in D. cabrerana and P. viridis from oxidative metabolism, thus allowing thetransport of the DMT through the intestinal wall and liver and making itavailable for the central nervous system. The serotonin reuptake inhibitortetrahydroharmine in B. caapi most probably adds to the overall effect ofAyahuasca on consciousness. In addition to the two main alkaloids harmine andtetrahydroharmine, some varieties of B. caapi contain active amounts ofharmaline.Yajé and Ayahuasca are still used by numerous indigenous groups of the UpperAmazon for contacting normally hidden spiritual realms, for hunting, forlearning about the plans of other people, for finding the etiology of illness,or for divination. Yajé or Ayahuasca is frequently a source for their art,expressed in body painting or the decoration of their material culture. It mayalso be used for memorizing myths or tales important to their communities; forreinforcing the social moral values, especially among the youth; and for gettingin touch with the spirits of other plants to learn about their properties (alluses are not necessarily present in each and every indigenous group).The importance of the plants involved in these preparations is reflected inmyths and narratives. They may have been revealed by beings living in underwaterrealms—considered especially powerful—or the offspring of the Sun afterimpregnation of a woman through her eyes (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975, Lagrou 2000,Luna 2011). The plants are considered sacred, with their collecting and handlingoften ritualized and their consumption occurring in special ceremonies, eithercollective or intimate.In some areas, these and other plants are considered teachers, a commonly heldidea the author first encountered while doing fieldwork in the Peruvian Amazonamong mestizo vegetalistas, or practitioners, specialized in certain especiallypowerful plants, or vegetales (Luna 1984, 1986), many of whom primarily usedAyahuasca for the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as for divination.Another commonly held idea is that by taking Ayahuasca and other sacred plants,it is possible to have a clearer mind and focus, enhanced sensory perception andimagery (and therefore the possibility of learning more easily), in addition toaccess to information not readily available in everyday life. It is commonlyheld that the plants strengthen and protect people from illnesses, includingthose caused by living agents such as other human beings or spirits.Practitioners often talk about la ciencia de la Ayahuasca, a concept thatdescribes the ability to find the plants in the forest, the knowledge of thekind of soil where they grow, their color and shape, the part of the plantsused, as well as the way to prepare them such as the amount of plant materialand water added, the intensity of the fire, the point of boiling, the moment atwhich the pot is taken off the fire, even the thoughts, songs, or prayers of theperson who is preparing the brew.Plant teachers include not only the plants involved in the preparation ofAyahuasca but also other plants that are used either as occasional admixtureplants, such as several species of Brugmansia and Brunfelsia grandiflora, or areused by themselves, such as Couroupita guianensis that is said to teach in thedreams, which are not necessarily psychotropic (Luna 1986, Beyer 2009). Thesubjacent idea is that by ingesting these plants, one gets in touch with theirspirits and learns from them, either directly in the visions that they mayproduce, or in dreams. Practitioners claim that it is possible to finetune one'spsyche in a controlled way in order to acquire certain cognitive abilities toperceive aspects of reality not available in normal consciousness. The Aguarunaof the Peruvian Amazon, for example, believe it is not enough simply to know thefacts: one must learn how to bring the body, the intellect, and the emotionstogether into the epiphany of the visionary experience (Brown 1985). Theacquired knowledge inspires cultural creations such as song, dance, bodypainting, or narratives, or otherwise benefits the individual or group. Incontemporary terms, we could say that for the practitioners, the plants arecognitive tools to enhance their cultural production.A NOTE ON AYAHUASCA SHAMANISM AND ART AMONG THE SHIPIBO OF THE UCAYALI RIVER,PERUIn 1987, I spent a month in Santa Rosa de Pirococha, a small Shipibo settlementof around seventy inhabitants on the left bank of the Ucayali Riverapproximately between the cities of Pucallpa and Orellana. The Shipibo arefamous for their elaborated designs—kené in their language—with which in earliertimes they decorated the objects of their material culture and their bodies.Nowadays, Shipibo women still embroider their skirts with elaborate geometricalpatterns. Originality is emphasized so that within their overall particularstyle, all the skirts are different (Figure 6). Nowadays, Shipibo women alsoproduce high-quality ceramics, which they also decorate with elaborategeometrical patterns (Figure 7). The Shipibo seem to see themselves as not onlycovered but also surrounded by a normally invisible field of colorfultridimensional patterns.The Shipibo are locally known for their shamanic traditions associated with theuse of shori, their vernacular name for Ayahuasca. The reason for my visitingSanta Rosa de Pirococha was to study the process of “learning from the plants,”which involves a certain diet and the repetitive ingestion of Ayahuasca. Duringthe one-month stay, I was guided by Don Basilio Gordon, at the time a reputedshaman and now deceased. For one month, I followed the prescribed traditionaldiet consisting of only manioc, plantains, and at times a little fish, and didnot consume any salt, sugar, or alcohol. I drank Ayahuasca thirteen times. As Ido not know the language, my training basically consisted of following themelody of the songs while under the effect of the brew and accompanying DonBasilio in his trips to the forest to see various plants.Image [images/p234-01.jpg]Figure 6: Young Shipibo Women, Santa Rosa de Pirococha, 1987Image [images/p234-02.jpg]Figure 7: Shipibo woman decorating a ceramic, Santa Rosa de Pirococha, 1987Don Basilio told me that when you know the songs of a given plant, it is notnecessary to use the physical plant, as all their physical properties areembedded in the song. In this tradition, healing is basically done through thesongs. There were always a few mestizo patients attending the ceremonies duringmy stay, but no members of the Shipibo community, except Irineo, a man in histhirties, who often sang along with Don Basilio.At the end of my stay, Don Basilio told me that he was going to sing a song toprotect me when going back to Pucallpa. When I asked him what he meant, he tookone of the cloths richly embroidered with geometrical patterns. “I am puttingthis on you,” he said. This was, for me, a confirmation of the work by Germananthropologist Angelika Gebhart-Sayer, who to my knowledge was the first personto find a relationship between the songs sung under the effect of Ayahuasca,Shipibo art, and healing, which involves the restoration of the beauty andharmony of the invisible patterns surrounding the body of the patients. Shewrites:Under ayahuasca influence, the shaman perceives, from the spirit world,incomprehensible, often chaotic, information in the form of luminous designs. Hethen “domesticates” this information by converting it into various aestheticnotions: geometric patterns, melodies/rhythm and fragrance which play a keypsychological and spiritual role for both the patient and society. Only throughthis mediating step the awesome and incomprehensible become an applicable corpusof shamanic cognition suitable for the mundane village (Gebhart-Sayer 1986).Shipibo art is one of the many examples of Amerindian art that point to anotherreality, to perhaps the threshold of geometric patterns that often appear at theonset of the visionary experience with Ayahuasca. The current interest ofWesterners in Ayahuasca has provoked an interest in Shipibo textiles andceramics that has created a renaissance in Shipibo art, body painting, andcultural identity.AYAHUASCA TRANSFORMATION NARRATIVESYajé and especially Ayahuasca already by the beginning of the 20th century wereadopted by a segment of the mestizo population of the Western Amazon. In the1930s, 1940s, and 1960s, they gradually gained a foothold among the urbanpopulation of non-Amazonian towns in Brazil, becoming a part of organizedreligions. Beginning in the 1980s with the experimentation of Westerners withAyahuasca and its various associated traditions, interest in Ayahuasca hasbecome an international phenomenon (cf. Labate & Jungaberle 2011). The numerousnarratives about Ayahuasca encounters and other plant preparations with asimilar phytochemistry, i.e., the so-called Ayahuasca analogues (Ott 1994), havemade possible comparative studies.Among the narratives available, I decided to concentrate on the theme oftransformation, which are so common in indigenous accounts and pre-Columbianiconography, particularly on that of jaguar transformation. Here are twoexamples of transformation from an anthology on Ayahuasca encounters (Luna &White 2000). The first, a jaguar transformation experienced during an Ayahuascasession by French anthropologist Dr. Françoise Barbira-Freedman. The secondexample is transformation into a water molecule and witnessing of thephotosynthesis process experienced by American ethnopharmacologist Dr. DennisMcKenna during a ritual of one of the Brazilian religious organizations that useAyahuasca as a sacrament.Barbira-Freedman studied shamanism among the Lamista during the early 1980s. Shepartook in ceremonies and participated in an apprenticeship process, graduallypenetrating into a worldview that challenged her own ideas about power andmorality. She was being “put right” by her shaman informants in the sense thatshe was becoming spiritually and physically stronger to be better able to copewith the cosmological realities of that culture. She relates how in one of herexperiences with the brew, she came face-to-face with a large female jaguarfollowing her. She goes on to relate how other jaguars she saw became angry whenshe picked some flowers and how she became transformed into a jaguar and beganto fight:A wave of intense aggressiveness unfurls in my solar plexus. This causes me tovomit, later than usual after taking Ayahuasca, and the process of “becomingjaguar” takes me over irresistibly. I feel it all at once, paws and claws, spineand tail, nose, whiskers and tail; I see with a jaguar's eyes, suddenlyencompassing a wider field of vision, prick a jaguar's ears, open my jaws inpractice. “My” jaguar has gone; It dawns on me that I have become her, am her,yet at the same time I retain the awareness of her merged with my consciousness.I find it easy to signal to the other jaguars to go away with mere bodylanguage, arching my back intensely. As I do this, I have a flashback of my catstanding up to the stray cats of a new neighborhood when we moved house inCambridge.Nothing I ever read about shamanic animal metamorphoses could have prepared mefor the total involvement of my senses, body, mind in this process. I am fullyexperiencing it, I am it, yet at the same time I retain the awareness of who Iam, albeit in jaguar form, partaking with other people clearly dealing withintense experiences of their own in an Ayahuasca ceremony. The female jaguarwhose form I have entices me to go into the forest where she will teach me theways of jaguars. Suddenly I am in a swampy area near an ox bow lake which is myhome and instantly I am made to understand/feel stalking prey, jumping andkilling, ripping, spreading fear and also feeling fear myself, being lonely andshy and even cowardly among the other animals there; surprisingly lounging andrelaxing in the water. ...It does not surprise me that the other shaman present, as an eagle, comes tofind me and blows gently on my crown. It is even reassuring, as surprised as Iam to know that this large harpy eagle is him, that as a jaguar I can physicallyrelate to the being of the eagle, particularly eyes, beak and talons. I respondto the ritual blowing and feel very calm and at ease in my jaguar self, keenlysensing my surroundings. (Barbira-Freedman 2000:115)Particularly noteworthy are the author's comments:This vision engaged my whole self experientially in a phenomenological approach,which was blatantly at odds with the empiricist standpoint I intellectuallyfavoured. There was no longer any other possible standpoint for me as ananthropologist than that of the shamanic rainbow, forever bridging betweenincommensurable perceptions and perspectives within highlands and lowlands,earth and sky, earth and water, from a constantly changing in-between.” (p. 117)The full text merits a close reading.Dennis McKenna was one of the invited guests at the first scientific conferenceorganized by the Uniâo do Vegetal (UDV) in Brazil. The UDV, created in PortoVelho in 1968 by José Gabriel da Costa, is the youngest of the Brazilianreligious organizations that use Ayahuasca as a sacrament, to which they givethe name of vegetal. The UDV conceives the brew as having two basic components:força (force) and luz (light).At the end of the conference, a ritual was held involving the consumption of thesacrament. After a second cup, McKenna found himself changed into a disembodiedpoint of view, suspended in space, thousands of miles over the Amazon basin”seeing a World Tree in the form of an enormous Banisteriopsis vine, “theembodiment of the plant intelligence that embraced and covered the earth, thattogether [with] the community of the plant species that existed on the earthprovided the nurturing energy that made life on earth possible.”McKenna “understood” that photosynthesis was the “force” the UDV were talkingabout, “indeed the force on which all life depends.” He relates:I found myself “instantly transported from my bodiless perch in space to thelightless depths beneath the surface of the earth. I had somehow become asentient water molecule, percolating randomly through the soil, lost amid thetangle of the enormous root fibers of the Banisteriopsis World Tree.” (McKenna2000:154–7)McKenna continues with an extraordinary, detailed narrative about his journeythrough the roots and vascular system of the vine, his arrival at the surface ofa leaf, and how as a water molecule, he not only witnessed but also participatedin the process of photosynthesis.Accounts by educated Westerners such as Barbira-Freedman and McKenna echo ideasfound in pre-Columbian art and in indigenous narratives. They point to a newalter-ego, to an alternative epistemology: the gaining of knowledge through aradical self-transformation, by taking an alternative—nonhuman—point of view, bycognitively merging with the focus of one's attention.The techniques for achieving such cognitive states are culture specific. Likethe mastery of any other technique, they require a special form of training.However, the various techniques have a biological dimension that is common toall human beings. The first steps in the scientific study of this biologicaldimension have already been taken in what amounts to an immense field of futureresearch. Hopefully the development of some of the new theories of humanconsciousness will take into account tools that traditional societies have usedfor thousands of years.An example of one such new theory of human consciousness is Ede Frecska's theoryof the dual complementary methods of knowledge acquisition (Frecska 2008). Theauthor proposes that the duality and complementarity in the physical universewhere there are particles and waves, mass and energy, local effects and nonlocalconnections is also found in a duality and a complementarity in knowledgeacquisition. Frecska posits the existence of two sources of knowledge:perceptual-cognitive and direct-intuitive, with the former having fewer problemsthan the latter with replicability. Perceptual-cognitive knowledge iselectrochemical (based on local effects), operates via neuroaxonal networks, islinguistic albeit not necessarily verbal, and relies on a modeling with asubject-object division. It peaks in Western scientific thinking.Direct-intuitive knowledge is quantum-physical (based on nonlocal connections),operates via subneural networks, it is ineffable, and relies on directexperience with no subject-object division. It is the source of contemplativetraditions.Winkelman, on the other hand, suggests evolutionary mechanisms by which earlyprimates would be able to metabolize substances toxic for other organisms foundin the natural environment, and which may have contributed to human evolution.CONCLUDING REMARKSClearly, psychointegrator agents do not simply disrupt normal perception. Itseems that through them, by mysterious ways of mind exploration not yetunderstood, it is indeed possible to access valid information not readilyavailable by ordinary means. Psychointegrator agents offer complex, oftenbeautiful, coherent, and useful experiences not normally accessible, to whichsome traditional societies assign great value. To dismiss such experiences asaberrations of the mind under the effect of drugs, which is the ordinaryaccepted discourse, is quite biased. Unbiased attention needs to be given tosuch phenomena. As William James pointed out, no account of the universe in itstotality can be final, which leaves these other forms of consciousness quitedisregarded (James 1929:379).The religious use of peyote by Native Americans in the United States andAyahuasca among the general population in Brazil and a few other countries hasbeen accepted. This is of course a great step forward. However, this is stilltoo short. Ferguson (2011) points out that one of the reasons for the scientificsuperiority of Western Europe over the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century wasthe unlimited sovereignty religion in the Muslim world: in 1515 a decree ofSultan Selim I had threatened with death anyone found using the printing press.To allow the religious use of Ayahuasca but to prohibit it as a tool forscientific and personal exploration would be a similar mistake. Science explorestoday the vast riches of outer space as well as the minute yet immense realms ofsubatomic particles. We explore the depth of the oceans and the forests, thehigh mountains and the deserts. Yet the exploration of consciousness is still aforbidden realm, vastly explored by shamanic societies yet neglected incontemporary science due to a great extent to religious preconceptions carriedthroughout centuries.Amerindian art, largely inspired by altered states of consciousness, has perhapsa message for us. It expresses forms of cognition neglected by most but stillaccessible to all of us as humans. The ontological reality of the worldsperceived through psychointegrator agents in the final analysis depends on theperceiver's worldview. Many traditional societies would not doubt the existenceof parallel and multidimensional worlds. With the exception of contemporarytheories in physics and cosmology, modern thinking does not admit the existenceof parallel and multidimensional universes. Short of direct experimentalverification, orthodox scientific thinking treats talk of parallel andmultidimensional universes as fiction if not as the projections of a derangedmind. This is not usually corroborated by those who have immersed themselvesdeeply in the study or experimentation of integrative states of consciousness.As a researcher, I often ponder about the reality of the worlds I perceivethrough Ayahuasca. A recent study on visual perception using functional MRIconcludes that practically neural activity observed in the primary visual cortexwhen having visions under the effects of Ayahuasca was indistinguishable thanduring normal perception. According to the authors, this means that visions havea real, neurological basis; they are not made up or imagined (Araújo et al.2011). Certainly this somehow explains why these alien perceptions often seem tosubjectively have the qualities of reality, at times even more so than normalreality. Interaction with normally invisible beings, visitation of apparentlycoherent—at least subjectively—other worlds are commonly reported by educatedindividuals. The fact is that, whether we want it or not, these otherdimensions—whatever their ontological reality—constantly emerge in our dailylife, either through the stories we tell our children—we all lived once in thoseforested and magical worlds—in the arts everywhere, in some of the religions wecreate, and certainly in our dreams. These other worlds and beings greatlyenrich our existence. Without them, as without our remaining forests and theiranimals, the world would be a duller place.NOTES1 [31_chapter22.html#c22-ft1].

Consider the following paragraph from the 1583Decree of the Church Council of Lima, Declaring the Quipus to be the Work of theDevil: “Consider prohibited in full books that deal directly with, or recount,or teach lascivious or unchaste things, for one must keep in mind that whichundermines the faith but also that which undermines good behavior—which readingsuch books usually does. And so those who have such books shall be rigorouslypunished by the bishops. However, ancient books in Latin, written bynon-Christians, shall be permitted, because of the elegance and propriety of theLatin language, provided that these lascivious books, even if they are in Latin,not be read to young boys. And because in lieu of books the Indians have used,and some continue to use, registers made of different threads, that they callquipus, and with these they preserve the memory of their old superstitions,rites, ceremonies, and perverse customs, the bishops should diligently try totake away from the Indians completely all the records or quipus that facilitatetheir superstition.” (Organización de la Iglesia y órdenes religiosas en elvirreinato del Perú en el siglo xvi: Documentos del Archivo de Indians.

In Mann's view (2011) it was the 1492 collisionof two Old Worlds that resulted in a New World.5 [31_chapter22.html#c22-ft5]. Plato, in his unfinished dialogue Critias, wrotea moving account of the damage done in his time: “What now remains compared withwhat then existed is like the skeleton of a sick man, all the fat and soft earthhaving wasted away. . . . Mountains which now have nothing but food for bees . .. had trees not very long ago. [The land] was enriched by yearly rains, whichwere not lost to it, as now, by flowing from the bare land into the sea; but thesoil was deep, and therein received the water, and kept it in the loamy earth .. . feeding springs and streams running everywhere. Now only abandoned shrinesremain to show where the springs once flowed” (Quoted by Wright [2004:87–8]).6 [31_chapter22.html#c22-ft6]. It is estimated that the amount of pristineforest in Western Europe is just 2–3 percent. In the European part of Russia5–10 percent of the forests can be classified as pristine or near-pristinenatural forests(http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&geography.htm[http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&geography.htm]).Deforestation in the Amazon area is well-known. Less so is the near-total lossof Brazilian Atlantic Coastal Forest, one of the areas of richest biodiversityand high endemism in the world—even more so than most of the Amazon area—ofwhich only around 7 percent remain of a million square kilometers of forest dueto urbanization, agriculture, and cattle ranching (Thomas 2008).7 [31_chapter22.html#c22-ft7].

Onehundred years ago, the Rigveda, an ancient Indian sacred collection of VedicSanskrit hymns and one of the oldest religious texts (ca. 1700–1100 BCE) incontinual use in any Indo-European language was accessible to the curious mind,but information about the Hawaiian mystical Kahuna tradition, or about theworldview of the Inuit circumpolar peoples was entirely lacking. As always, manypieces of the overall human cultural spectrum are still missing, but theteachings derived from a wide variety of cultures about the Great Mystery ofhuman existence can now be studied from different perspectives, and thecross-cultural similarities are stunning.Ethnographic data collected over the last one hundred years has generated afertile field for those interested in studying cross-cultural commonalities.Frecska and Luna (2006) have discussed why the ideas of soul, spirit, or rebirthecho across the ages and why these concepts repeatedly appear in entirelydifferent cultures. The belief in the existence of soul(s), spirit guides,spiritual forces, and other worldly realms appears to be universal in the humanspecies. Edward Osborne Wilson (1998) has noted that sociology has identifiedthe belief in a soul to be one of the universal human cultural elements, and hehas suggested that science needs to investigate what predisposes people tobelieve in a soul. With our coauthors, we have made efforts to overcome thetypical rational interpretations that deem such ideas to be superstition,originating in delusion or the fear of death. We accept that these recurrent,prevailing themes (“elementary ideas”—as they were called by Adolf Bastian, oneof the founders of ethnography) (see Koepping, 1983) are not just products ofwishful thinking, and represent more than irrational coping mechanisms againstthe anxiety of ego-dissolution at death.The focal point of the current paper is the observation that the concept of soulis noticeably complex in aboriginal cultures, and its plural—especiallytripartite—nature is the rule rather than the exception. Curiously, thisperception is getting clearer and more pronounced when one considers ourshamanic origins. Herewith, we refer to Wilhelm Wundt (1920) who gave muchattention to the point that the animistic perception of the soul is pluralistic.Among aboriginal groups, the term soul cannot be used as it is in the Westerntradition because indigenous peoples widely hold the belief in multiple souls(or aspects) of a human being. There are advanced cultures where the number ofprinciples defining the human essence is reduced to a number smaller than three(e.g., the duality of ling-hun in Chinese traditional medicine), but a thoroughlook reveals that such dualism (or monism) is a deflation of an earlier trinity(Harrell, 1979). Taoism, which has shamanic origins (Stutley, 2003), teachesthat there are three souls, one of which remains with the corpse after death(like the Ka of the ancient Egyptians), while another resides always in thespirit world, and the third that transmigrates between the physical back to thespiritual realms. Shinto lore suggests the soul has multiple sections that canact and move around independently, so it may be that different parts havedifferent afterlives—one being reincarnated, one becoming a guardian, etc. Asfar as advanced Mesopotamian civilizations are concerned, there seems not tohave been any clear concept of a soul in neither Sumerian, nor Babylonian, andAssyrian religions. One may just speculate if these advanced civilizations havemoved far from their source.Swedish Sanskritist Ernst Arbman (1926/1927) analyzed the Vedic beliefs in Indiaand found that the concept of the soul (atman) was preceded by a duality. In hisanalysis, Arbman separated the soul inhabiting the body and endowing it withlife and action from the free-soul, an unencumbered soul-aspect embodying theindividual's nonphysical mode of existence not only after death but also indreams, trances, and other altered states of consciousness (ASCs). According tohis classification, the free-soul doesn't have any physical or psychologicalattributes; it simply represents the immortal spiritual essence of theindividual.In this regard, Arbman addressed the issue of duality but implicitly wrote abouttripartition since he combined two soul parts for which different cultures haveseparate names (see Table 1). In addition to the free-soul, the physical soul orbody-soul is often divided into several components. Usually it falls into twocategories, one of which is the “life-soul,” the vital force, frequentlyidentified with the breath, while the other is the “ego-soul,” the source ofthoughtful action and decision making. In the Vedic tripartite soul concept, thefree-soul incorporated the psychological attributes of the bodysoul, adevelopment that occurred among a number of other cultures.One of Arbman's most gifted pupils Åke Hultkrantz (1953) followed his master'slead while studying Native American Indians and took the same stance, speakingabout dualism while describing a trinity. Bremmer (1983) has addressed howmultiplicity can be obscured by the focus of interest and the concepts of thesoul held by the field investigators themselves. In this regard, Arbman andHultkrantz were clearly more interested in the free-soul and in its evolutionover time and accordingly paid less attention to the “life-soul” and “ego-soul”as independent entities. Their predecessors and contemporaries were also moreinterested in the myths of Afterlife than in tribal psychology. The main goalsof this publication are: 1) to give a detailed analysis of ancient andindigenous soul concepts within the framework of tripartition, 2) to outline adynamical relationship between the soul components, and 3) to provide atentative “neuro-ontological” interpretation based on a biophysical approach.SOUL CONCEPTS IN EARLY CIVILIZATIONSANCIENT EGYPTThe conception of the soul in Ancient Egypt was complex. The Egyptians conceivedof a person's individuality as being made up of several independent beings, eachof which was a distinct personality seen as a whole having a separate existenceboth during life and after death. Their belief system that appears to have beenbased in direct shamanic experience included a number of souls or soul aspectsand auxiliary entities that together constituted the individual. According toEgyptian funerary texts, man was composed of a mortal body, the Kha, and atleast three soul principles: the Ka, Ba, and Akh (Hall, 1965). * Ka represented the spiritual essence, which made the difference between a living and a dead person. It was received at the instant of birth by breath, and death occurred when Ka left the body. The ancient Egyptians contributed life-giving energy to the Ka. This characteristic makes Ka similar to the concept of “life-soul” or “spirit” in other religions and the “energy body” in contemporary Western thought. * Ba referred to all those qualities that make up a person, including everything nonphysical that makes an individual unique, similar to the Western view of personality. In this regard, Ba is the closest to the contemporary notion of “ego-soul” or “mental-soul.” Ka and Ba were held to be very much attached to the physical body: they had physical needs, like food and water, confirming their resemblance to Arbman's two body-souls. * The most important player who has the leading role in the Afterlife was the immortal soul called the Akh. Following the death of Kha, the Ba and Ka had to be reunited to reanimate the Akh. The Egyptian funerary customs were intended to aid the deceased in becoming an Akh, to prevent rebirth and “dying a second time in the Afterlife.” In the Egyptian religion, this second death was possible and permanent. Akh was associated with thought, but not as an action of the mind; rather, it was a form of pure consciousness, analogous to the higher self or immortal spiritual Oversoul in Western thought. It was believed to be able to wander away (Ka and Ba could also do that), to haunt the deceased body if the tomb was not in order, and it could either do harm (sickness, nightmares, and bad feelings) or extend good (protection) toward persons still alive. Within the frame of the ancient Egyptian belief system, Akh corresponds the best to the “free-soul” or higher self of a human being.In addition to the Ka, Ba, and Akh, there were further principles, which makethe comparison more difficult: the Ib (metaphysical heart center of compassion),Sheut (shadow aspect of the person), Ren (name soul aspect of the person), Sahu(spiritual body for the Akh), and Sekhem (spiritualenergetic entity dwelling inthe Afterlife in association with Akh). An interesting parallel can be noticedhere with the Taoist conception of the “immortal spirit body.”Accordingly, it can be observed that the ancient Egyptian soul concept is anexample of the inflation of the number of soul aspects: In comparison to othertraditions (Table 1), a segregation and transformation of soul elements ispresumable. The idea of an independent and pure immaterial existence was soforeign to Egyptian thought that it assigned spiritual body (Sahu) and spiritualforce (Sekhem) to the potentially eternal soul form (Akh), and delegated theother soul forms (Ka and Ba) for its help. It also seems that by Sekhem, ancientEgyptians introduced a complementary, ethereal version of the “life-soul” (vitalforce) by granting it to the deceased person's Akh as an energetic force. Afterall, in Egyptian cosmology, nothing existed in isolation, and duality was anorm.PRE-CLASSICAL GREECEThe Christian worldview is monistic, allowing for only one soul per human body.The Trinity applies only to God, but not to man. However, centuries before,there were many discussions of the pluralistic concept of the human soul. In theearly Greco-Roman period, the mindbody problem was complex: On the one hand,there was the psyche (Greek), or anima or genus (both Latin), an unencumberedsoul that survives death. The Greek concept of the psyche is confusing toWestern investigators. While on the one hand, it can closely correspond withArbman's free-soul, some regard the psyche as passive while the body is alive.Its presence is the precondition for the continuation of life, yes,but—following the Greek tradition—Western scholars hold that it has noconnections with the physical or psychological characteristics of theindividual. In other words, it doesn't carry over one's personal identity ormemories after death but instead enters the Underworld as a shadow of the livingperson (Bremmer, 1983).On the other hand, there was the Greek concept of the thymos, or in Latin animusor fumus, which is the seat of personal identity and personal memories, butwhich dies with the physical body. It is this soul part that is the seat ofemotions. Unlike psyche, thymos was believed to be active only when the body isawake. Thirdly, noos was a soul form representing the intellect and generatingthe willful actions of the person. There also was a soul component called menos,which can be described as a momentary impulse of combined mental and physicalagencies directed toward a specific act. It was said to be able to manifestitself in a berserk-like fury. After the Archaic Age (800–500 BCE), there was agradual incorporation of thymos and the noos into the psyche, which made thelatter the center of the self—the organ of both thought and emotion.Accordingly, Plato goes as far as to include all intellectual functions(originally belonging to the noos) into the psyche.The resemblance of the Archaic Greek soul belief to that of most indigenouspeoples (to be discussed) strongly suggests that it belongs to a type of tribalsociety consciousness in which the individual is not yet in the center of focus(Bremmer, 1983). It may also reflect the effect of a tradition based less onphilosophical speculation but rather more on the direct experience of whichshamans and tribal healers were masters. Hultkrantz (1953) cites Edward Tylor,the 19th-century scholar of comparative religion who observed that the belief ina personal supernatural aspect or soul formed the original foundation forreligious awareness: “The material shows that the greatest importance should beascribed to such experiences and observations for the development of the ideasof the soul.” Apparently, a “direct-intuitive approach,” “the second foundationof knowledge” (Strassman et al., 2007) is the source that was suppressed withthe unfolding of Western civilization, dominated by Judeo-Christian overlay.CLASSICAL GREECELack of direct experience can partly explain—at least—that in our own time, theconcept of the soul is one of the most ambiguous, confusing, and poorly definedof our human ideas. As the antipode of the material essence, it exists as anentity substantially different from the body. Within this concept, the soul isthe principle of life, action, and thought, and in this framework, body and mindcan depart from it and go on in separate paths (like in Hindu mythology) . . .or they cannot be separated but can be opposed to each other (as in the threeAbrahamic religions). In other approaches, the soul designates the totality ofthe self, refers to every level of the individual, and represents both theessence and the wholeness of human nature.In this essay, we are going to refer to it in the latter meaning.Discovering the “true” nature of the self has always been part of the GreatMystery, for unless one understands who and what we are, one cannot experiencethe mantle of authentic initiation. In Western philosophy, the 5th century BCEIonian philosopher, mathematician, and mystic Pythagoras was the first toexpress his ideas about this during the classical period, proposing that everyhuman being has three principia: a physical aspect (body, or soma), anintellectual-emotional aspect (mind, or psyche), and an immortal spirit.Pythagoras's three principia have influenced numerous thinkers and philosophersacross time—among them Plato, Aristotle, Galen of Pergamon, and the Renaissancephysician Paracelsus. One must also keep in mind the Freudian “Id—Ego—Superego,”or the Jungian “conscious—subconscious—collective unconscious” personalitymodels, both of which converge on this ancient perception.Yet the tripartite division of human nature was probably recognized far earlierthan Pythagoras since we can find its categorical depictions in the manymillennia old shamanic traditions of the indigenous peoples. In fact, it isconceivable that the Greek philosopher himself was drawing on the shamanictraditions of tribal cultures. Christopher Janaway (1995) wrote: “The body oflegend which grew around Pythagoras attributes to him superhuman abilities andfeats. Some think these legends developed because it is more likely thatPythagoras was a Greek shaman.” Indeed, Aristotle described Pythagoras as awonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure. According to Aristotle andothers' accounts, some ancients believed that he had the ability to travelthrough space and time, and to communicate with animals and plants, all featuresthat link him with the shamanic tradition (Huffman, 2009). Herodotus and modernscholars (Dodds, 1951) admit that Greek civilization was greatly influenced bythe shamanistic culture of the Black Sea Scythians in the 7th century BCE.Kingsley (1999, 2003) presents evidence through the fragmentary writingsattributed to the 6th-century mystic and shaman Parmenides of Velia, a smalltown in southern Italy, that the shamanistic tradition (iatromantis) actuallyformed the foundation for Western thought and philosophy, one that Plato did notfully understand. Seen in this perspective, Pythagoras and his fellow“Pythagoreans” were most definitely practitioners and teachers in the shamanicfoundation.SOUL CONCEPTS IN INDIGENOUS CULTURESAFRICAAccording to the view of the Kwawu people in Ghana, three soul categoriesanimate each human being. “At the time of conception, blood and flesh come fromthe mother. The person's body comes from his mother, belongs to his mother'smatrilineage, and ultimately returns to the Great Mother: Earth.” It is occupiedby the bodily soul form saman. A person receives semen from the father atconception. By this medium, a child gets fertility and cleanliness. Cleanlinessmeans morality in a spiritual sense, while fertility is closely linked topersonality by them. The soul component associated to it is called sunsum. “Incontrast to blood and semen that a child obtains at conception, the breath oflife is received from the God2 [32_chapter23.html#c23-aft2] at time of birth.”The soul part entering the body this way is called kra. Death means that kra istaken back by the God (Bartle, 1983).ASIASurprisingly similar to this African soul concept is that of the Mongolianshamanic tradition that also considers that people have three souls. Accordingto the Darkhad shamans, one soul comes from the maternal side (the soul thatgoverns flesh and blood), a second is a bone soul from the paternal side, andthe third soul comes from the Spirit World. The third one, the immortal soul,transmigrates from the Spirit World to a fetus in the womb. After death, itstays for a short while in the body, and then later, seeing the light, it movesback to the Spirit World and, eventually, transmigrates back into another baby(Purev, 2004).In other parts of Mongolia, the soul form ami is held to be the soul thatenlivens the body. It is related to the ability to breathe—in other words to thebreath. After death it returns to the Upper World in the form of a bird (likethe Ba of the Egyptians). During an illness the ami soul may temporarily bedisplaced, but it does not leave permanently until death. Ami may reincarnateamong the relatives of the dead person. The suld is the most individualized ofthe human souls. It lives in a physical body only once; after death it remainsaround the body for a while, and then it takes residence in the Middle World.The suns soul, like the suld, also contributes to the formation of personality,but it carries the collected experiences of past lives. The suns reincarnatesand stays in the Other World between incarnations but may return as a ghost tovisit friends or relatives. Among the two reincarnating souls, the suns usuallybears the strongest past-life memories. The suns soul may also temporarily leavethe living body and sometimes wander as far as the Lower World, which mayrequire a shaman to negotiate for its return. This Mongolian tripartite soulconcept clearly reflects the three-tier shamanic cosmology (Sarangerel, 2000).Throughout Siberia, it is widely held that all humans possess at least threesouls; some groups such as the Samoyedes believe there are more: four in womenand five in men. Not every author agrees on the concept of multiple souls.Shirokogoroff is skeptical of this notion: “I believe that in some instances ofvery multiple souls . . . we have the ethnographer's complex, his creation andnot that which exist in [the indigenous population's] mind” (Shirokogoroff1935/1982, p. 54). Some sort of deculturalization process adds to the confusion:Western influences and missionary assimilations have greatly adumbrated the soulconcept of numberless tribes. Even so, the examples above suggest thathumanity's archaic culture—the hunter-gatherer culture—perceived the reality ofthe soul trinity over thousands of years, and the commonality, even perhapsuniversality of the tripartite soul concept is plausible. Like in the case ofthe shamanic cosmology: the three-tier view is the most common worldwide,despite numerous deviations (for example, the twelve-level worldview of theSouth American Yagua tribe) (Fejos, 1943).The Puyuma people—indigenous in Taiwan—believe that each person has three souls,one of which resides in the head, and the other two reside on each shoulder.Chinese aborigines belonging to the Hmong tribes follow their ancient shamanictradition and believe that each living body has many souls (not in fullagreement on the numbers, though). For a newborn infant, one soul enters his orher body when he or she is conceived in the mother's womb. Another soul enterswhen the baby has just emerged from the mother's body and taken its firstbreath. A third one will have to be called on the third morning after birth. Thefirst soul is the one that normally stays with the body. The second soul isfree, it wanders; this free-soul causes a person to dream while asleep. Thethird soul is the protective soul that tries to protect its owner from harm(Symonds, 2005).AMERICAThe Native American Lakota Sioux distinguish the woniya (physical self), nagi(cognitive self), and nagila (spiritual self). Similarly, the Inuit Eskimosseparate three souls: an anerneq soul, which we receive with the first breath atthe moment of birth, an ateq soul, which we get with our names after birth, anda tarneq, our immortal soul. The Caribbean Voodoo religion also differentiatesthree forms of soul: gros bon ange, ti bon ange, and z'étoile (Wesselman, 2008.)The Shuar (Jívaro) headhunter tribe living in the Upper Amazon regions ofEcuador also believes in the trinity of the soul (Winkelman and Baker, 2008). Intheir culture, everyone bears a “true soul,” the nekás wakanl, which arises atthe moment of birth. This soul resides in the blood of an individual, andtherefore blood loss equates to partial soul loss to a Shuar. The “true soul”leaves the body when one dies, and it starts an immortal existence reliving theentire life of the individual that it belonged to. After reliving this life, itmay become a forest demon, or after several transformations, it evolves intomist and in this form unifies with the cloud of every deceased person's “truesoul.” The war-cultivating Shuars are pragmatically minded and preoccupied withtheir everyday warfare. Therefore, the “true soul” interests them the leastamong the three, since—they suppose—it has minimal effect on their actualaffairs.The second soul is the arutam wakanl, which brings vision (arutam), and providesprotection to the person. This “protecting soul” is so important that no one canreach adulthood without it, and it has to be gained before puberty. To acquirethis soul, a young Shuar boy must go out into the forest for a vision quest ofabout five days. It is the vision (arutam) that brings power and intelligence;it shields against malevolence and witchcraft. Over the course of a lifetime, awarrior acquires several “protecting souls,” or helping spirits that give himextra protection.The third one is the “avenging soul,” the muisak wakanl, which takes the stagewhen an arutam bearer is murdered. The function of muisak wakanl is revenge.When an individual with arutam wakanl is killed, his “avenging soul” leavesthrough the mouth and proceeds to try to kill the murderer. Because the Shuarsare frequently engaged in killing raids, it is important for them to come upwith a mechanism to stop the “avenging souls” from coming after them. This isthe reason why the shrunken heads (tsantsa) are made. Shrinking the headprevents the muisak from leaving the body, and covering it with charcoal blindsthis “avenging soul.” Moreover, the preparation moves the power of muisak to thekiller's family (for example awarding them with more food). However, the muisakmeans potential danger for the tribe even when it is incarcerated into thetsantsa, so after a while, they excommunicate it to its village of origin, orsell the head to someone passing by (e.g., a tourist). In the belief system ofthe Shuars, the three-soul concept serves a double function: the conservation oftribal warfare and the protection of the individual's well-being (Winkelman andBaker, 2008).According to the view of Hawaiian aboriginals (Kahuna mysticism), everybody hasa lower soul—the ‘unihipili, connected to the body and feelings, a medial soul;‘uhane, related to mentality and thinking; and a superior, immortal ‘aumakua(Wesselman and Kuykendall, 2004, Wesselman, 2008, 2011). Ancient Greek thinkerswould definitely ponder upon the tripartite definition of the Kahuna tradition,as in classical Greek thought, the psyche subsumed the emotional and thecognitive functions into one, while the Polynesians perceive these to befunctions of two quite different souls.THE TRIPARTITE “SOUL CLUSTER”The composite picture derived from the concepts of the soul in numerous culturesoutlines meaningful commonalities and offsets insignificant differences. Theresults suggest that the singularity defined as “self” by Westerners is actuallya cluster, a personal “soul cluster” (Table 1). All aspects of the soul clusterare combined to create a functional self, and all of them are part of the sametotality, originating from the same source, yet they exist in very differentstates of quality. In considering the Hawaiian Kahuna teachings, we find apsychodynamically intriguing interplay between the three soul components, a sortof soul dynamic that has been utilized in treatment concepts and enjoys anextensive multicultural acceptance spanning across space and time. It has beenmy experience (Frecska) that my psychiatric patients can relate to thistripartite soul division more easily than to the terminology and psychodynamicapproach of classical psychoanalysis.The indigenous peoples understand that the harmony between the components of theself (i.e., the soul forms) is essential for physical and mental health. If therelationship between them is well-balanced and the unity of the three soulcomponents is maintained, then health persists. In other instances where thereis disharmony within and between them, healing intervention is necessary.In the following, we plan to cast light upon the benefits of this perceptionthat are not quite present in Western teachings and practice. Conversely, thetraditions of the indigenous cultures can provide this to us if we are open tothem. Concretely, as it is expressed in the Kahuna protocol, every soul form canact both independently—in different roles according to their special attributesas well as in special intra- and transpersonal dynamics. Longterm or evencomplete and final healing may be based on the practical use of thisrecognition.Table 1: The Various Presentations of the Tripartite “Soul Cluster”Image [images/p254-01.jpg]HAWAIIAN KAHUNA THOUGHTS ON THE SOUL ASPECTS‘AUMAKUA: THE IMMORTAL FREE-SOULAs mentioned above, the Hawaiian expression ‘aumakua refers to the supreme,immortal aspect of the self and can be translated as “utterly trustworthyancestral spirit,” or as “the spirit that hovers over me.” In Western teachings,this component of the self appears as the “overself,” the “higher self,” the“divine me,” the “angelic self,” the “transpersonal witness,” the “god self,”and the like. Symbolic illustrations of it in the West depict it typically as abenevolent winged creature, a guardian angel. In Polynesia, it is associatedwith the creator deity Kane or Tane, and is depicted by an upright stonemonolith. Following Wesselman and Kuykendall (2004) and Wesselman (2011), wecall it Oversoul, which can be conceptualized as our personal share of theall-encompassing Holy Spirit, or as some call it “the Human Spirit.” Originally,it was Ralph Waldo Emerson who coined the word Oversoul while a divinity studentat Harvard University.The visitation of something magnificent, benevolent, and divine is a frequentsubjective experience during mystical altered ASCs, either occurringspontaneously or induced by transpersonal techniques. Those who are lessfamiliar with direct transcendent experiences may interpret this presence as adivine visitation of an angelic greeting or even as a manifestation of theAlmighty father-God, and we must always observe that such visitations cannot beruled out. However such a transpersonal connection is interpreted, one canobserve a tendency for the mystical presence to be perceived as being outsidethe subject's self, although it most likely may be the manifestation of one'sown Oversoul. Such a claim must be validated by the words most likely,as—paradoxically—similar interpretations tend to be more accurate when they areless categorizing (i.e., not the “either–or” kind).In the Polynesian Kahuna tradition (Wesselman and Kuykendall, 2004; Wesselman,2008, 2011), our Oversoul is observed to be in permanent connection with us inevery moment of our lives, both waking and sleeping, whether we are aware of itor not. This connection appears to be surprisingly easy to manifest or activate,and those who practice meditation have a greater ongoing access than those whodo not. As part of our soul matrix, the Oversoul monitors all our deeds andthoughts, actions and reactions, emotions and relationships, revealing thatprivacy is truly an illusion. This self-aspect is passive but not dispassionatetoward us, silently feeling concern for our wrong decisions and silentlyrejoicing upon our successful choices. The Oversoul is a silent observer, as theresponsibility for decision making belongs to another self-aspect, themental-soul or egoic self. This reveals that for most of our lives, our Oversouldoes not interfere with our mundane affairs, and neither does it dictate what todo—it respects the right of free choice. However, its protection and guidancecan be asked for and invoked. Without such a request, it is only in the rarestcases—perhaps to avoid an “untimely end”—when such an “angelic intervention” ormiraculous avoidance experience may happen.As our wise spirit teacher, our Oversoul is also the source of our inspirationand intuition. It may send us dreams and visions in which it may appear in theimage of a spiritual teacher or other wise being, depending on the person'sculture, belief systems, and mythical world. Cross-cultural examples reveal thatpeople who have been raised in European traditions may have transpersonalexperiences of discarnate entities known in Polynesian or Mesoamericancivilizations. In a relaxed meditative state of perfect calmness and innerpeace, such connections can be achieved . . . and then, upon recalling a certainproblem, an answer to the dilemma may suddenly appear within the meditator'sconscious awareness revealing that the Oversoul is passive only for the passiveperson. Through personal divination, it may serve as a source of information,and this service can be cultivated with practice.The Kahuna tradition reveals that the ‘aumakua, the Oversoul, is also ourpersonal creator: the primordial source of our self. At birth it divides itself,sending in a seed of its light that takes up residence within a new body for anew life with the first breath, revealing the breath to be the vehicle oftransfer. As our “divine source,” it projects a hologram of its immortalsoulcharacter into the newborn, including all its cosmic information content.Similar to many other cosmogenic myths, the Kahuna tradition emphasizes that ourpersonal creator is not a monotheistic off-planet father god, but rather our owndivine and immortal part of our self.All individual Oversouls create a holographic field—the spirit of humankind,termed ka po'e ‘Aumakua (Wesselman and Kuykendall, 2004). As the Oversoulresides outside space and time (i.e., it is nonlocal), the result of thissummation is the cumulative (past + present + future) experience and wisdom ofour species Homo sapiens. This database corresponds to the “collectiveunconscious” in Carl Jung's terminology. In Kahuna thought, it is aninexhaustible resource of information, which has been and is being tapped bymystical philosophers and shamanic healers, and which is theoreticallyaccessible to all of us, all the time. Connection with it is often realizedduring rituals and ceremonies, and in integrative forms of ASCs, with thebody-soul being the mediatory agent between our mental-soul and our Oversoul.‘UNIHIPILI: LIFE-GIVING FORCE, THE BODY-SOULUpon its arrival in the biological medium, the nonlocal Oversoul seed mustachieve a successful relationship with another soul already in residence: thebody-soul sourced into us from our mother and father. The usage of the termslocal and nonlocal is essential for us, as they serve as the basis for arationalizing approach that will be explicated. The body-soul approximates whatpsychoanalysis calls the “personal unconscious.” In the Kahuna tradition, thisself or soul aspect is the source of all our emotions and feelings and is incharge of the entire operation of the physical body, including its repair andrestoration. Next to the energetic matrix of the body-soul and that of our ownOversoul, the third soul form, the mental or egoic soul, takes form in responseto life as we live it and is shaped by our life events.According to the Kahuna thought, the body-soul, being energetic in nature,serves as the location of our personal memory storage, and so it is this soulthat may recall all personal events upon request by the mental-soul. It is thedatabase of all instinctual and learned behavior and thus serves as our personaloperating system and inner hard drive.The body-soul communicates to the other soul components, the mental as well asthe spiritual, by reacting to our life events with emotional responses,expressing what it likes or dislikes. The body-soul does not lie; it expressesitself without inhibitions in the language of emotions, revealing exactly how itfeels about a family member, a friend, a job, or a life opportunity. As theinterface between our inner and outer worlds, it vividly monitors both therealities in which we act as well as those in which we think, feel, and dream.We could describe it as the mind of the body, which uses our sensory organs togather information, then forwards the data to our receiving self (mental-soul).This interface function should be emphasized, because the body-soul is both thesender and receiver of all psychic experiences as well as shamanic visions. Itis thus the part of our self that makes the spiritual world accessible,according to Kahuna teaching and practice. The inner portal, through which wemay make contact with our spiritual guardians and teachers, is located justthere, within it. Even the Oversoul part of our self communicates through it tothe third soul aspect, the mental-soul or intellect.The body-soul is the soul of great possibilities. It is at one and the same timematerial and immaterial, bound by matter and yet free. When Wilhelm Wundt (1920)combined the breath-soul with the idea of the free-soul, he did that on goodgrounds as both are unsubstantial and unstable. From a psychological viewpoint,the conception of the free-soul, Oversoul, is identical with the memory image ofthe dead person projected back into the supernatural reality—the airy, etherealshape of the deceased like a condensation of human breath. The Oversoul and thebody-soul thus have qualifications favoring a meeting and merging.The body-soul—although not by logical abstraction—is able to reason. It providesus with conclusions based on immediate experience. It remembers everything thatsucceeds or that which causes pain and damage. It is programmed in such a waythat induces such behavioral output that helps survival. The body-soul is afundamental driving force toward our growth, upon acquiring new skills that helpus to grow, increase, and become more than we were.As mentioned above, the body-soul is also our inner healer, programmed to repairour bodies. It restores us based on our genetic as well as our energeticinheritance, and as such, it works with the interactive field of our bodycomponents. According to Kahuna thought, these two sources—genetic andenergetic—are essential in the healing function because the body-soul is notcreative; it is not able to invent and does not draw a plan, but it follows thegenetic and energetic blueprint around and with which the body was formed. It isnot a leader, but it executes commands as a good subordinate, and it functionsat its best when getting unambiguous directives from the mental-soul—from thesoul form (self aspect) that is named ego in the West.‘UHANE: OUR EGO, AS THE MENTAL-SOULNext to the Oversoul and body-soul, the third aspect of our self is themental-soul, which takes form in the process of our reactions to life events.Well known to the West, this is the intellectual part of the “I” that thinks,analyzes information, integrates, adjudges, assigns meaning to, and functions asour chief executive. It is the source of our rational mind and intentions, andthe realizer of our creative inspirations. The mental-soul conceptualizes newideas, thought forms, and goals, and then aspires to reach them. However, as wehave mentioned earlier, the source of this inspiration is the Oversoul, which isaccessible to the mental-soul via the interface of the body-soul. In otherwords, the mental-soul is our intellectual, rational, creative, copingapparatus—our inner director. It is the side of our self that is continuouslychanging on the basis of our experiences and collected knowledge. Themental-soul is also the bearer of our belief systems that it holds to be true,those same convictions that underlie how well it directs. If the mental-soulfaces a challenge that it deems uncontrollable, then it may become inefficient.For example, if one accepts that his or her illness is incurable (and this oftenhappens by external influence, like a medical opinion), then the mental-soul maysurrender to the illness.In Kahuna teaching, a connection exists between feelings and emotions generatedby the body-soul and the belief systems held by the egoic self, and long beforeAaron Beck, the Kahunas assumed that the former depend on the latter. Theyunderstood that feelings inform the mental-soul about which belief is currentlythe operative one, and that the body-soul expresses its opinion about thedominating schema in the form of feelings. The mental-soul then has a choice,whether to accept the subconscious message and to act accordingly, or to discardit by declaring as invalid. Mental and physical health presumes a good workingrelationship between the mental-soul and the body-soul. Indeed, this is not ademocratic relationship; the mental-soul is the master, and the body-soul is theservant. As the superior agent of our coping mechanism, the mental-soul directsthe activity of the bodysoul, which serves as its executer. However, thisdominance is maintained only in the ordinary state of consciousness, whenorientation to the outer world is adaptive and the main daily task is coping.Meditative, contemplative, and ritual techniques may break the mental edges andthe dominance of the ego, and may evoke a state in which the mental-soulintrospectively receives signals coming from the Oversoul, crossing the bridge(or interface) of the body-soul.The mental-soul has a rather heterogeneous and sometimes obscure nature. In its“pure” form, it constitutes a hypostasis of the stream of consciousness, thecenter for thinking and willing—the intentional mind in a broad sense. But atthe same time, the mental-soul manifests certain peculiar features, which makesit clear that it is not just an expression of the individual's own personalitybut also functions as a being within the individual which endows him withthought, will, and so on. This “soul of consciousness” is motivated by order(this influence is coming from the Superego in Freudian theory); the body-soulby comparison is motivated by desire or pleasure (a characteristic of theFreudian Id). The conscious content of the ego may thus manifest certainindependence—especially when neurotic persons are found to be in conflict withcompulsive notions, acts, phobias, etc., sourced by the body-soul. Thispeculiarity of the mental-soul explains why we find it now split into severalpotencies, now taking up an exaggeratedly independent, at times superior,attitude toward its owner. On the other hand, most addictive or impulsivebehaviors are expressions of the body-soul that may assume dominance over apoorly developed mental-soul.THE TRIPARTITE SOUL-CONCEPT IN EUROPEAN AND NEAR-EASTERN CULTURESThe Polynesian teachings draw upon the dynamism and essence of much the sametrinity that accompanies the history of many other cultures, including thesignificant tradition in Western thinking. It is indeed thought provoking for usthat at the dawn of European philosophy, expressed through Pythagoras and Plato,the transcultural similarity is demonstrable. Pythagoras believed in theimmortality and transmigration of the soul. Plato understood that the souldiffers from the body and that it can exist separately as pure thinking, but histhoughts do not reflect whether the soul can or cannot survive death (Janaway,1995). Plato argues that the human soul has three parts: Logos (an intellective,rational part), Thymos (a spirited part, having to do with emotion and will),and Eros (an appetitive part, having to do with drives and basic impulses). Eachof us has two mortal soul parts—appetite and spirit—plus one, the intellect,which is immortal (Sedley, 2009).Aristotle avoids addressing the principle of immortality. He thinks of the soulas a substance, the form of a potentially living natural body, whichaccomplishes and consummates the possibility of supplying bodily functions.Aristotle attempts to explain life processes with the soul; he distinguishesthree soul parts, according to three assumed life processes:nutrition–reproduction, sensation, and cognition. In his case, the unity of theself is already far away. Aristotle did not consider the soul in its entirety asa separate, ghostly occupant of the body (just as we cannot separate theactivity of cutting from the knife). As the soul, in Aristotle's view, is anactuality of a living body, it cannot be immortal. Perhaps it was the influenceof his physician father that caused the narrowing of his soul concept tobiological and psychological relations. Following Aristotle's footsteps, Westernscientific thinking was influenced accordingly, until it reached the point wherethe notion of the soul had eventually become completely disqualified. We take itthat, avoiding the metaphysical, “direct-intuitive” experience (Strassman etal., 2007) provided by integrative forms of ASCs (like the shamanic state), theidea of immortal soul has gradually lost ground in Western philosophy.Yet Aristotle also described a quality of being that is closely allied with theperception of the Oversoul. He called it the entelechy—that which is alreadyrealized as opposed to the energia (the energy body) that carries the life forcethat motivates and orients an organism toward self-fulfillment. The entelechywas understood in classical philosophy as a fullness of actualization thatrequires ongoing process and effort in order to continue to grow and thus exist,perpetually becoming itself . . . a good description of the Oversoul.Plotinus of Lycopolis (205–270 CE) presents arguments for thetripartition-cum-trilocation of the soul (Plotinus, 1991) advanced by Plato inTimaeus (2001). His version is marked by a clear spatial separation between thethree parts of the soul: reason in the brain, will in the heart, and desire inthe liver. Plotinus refers to the ideas presented by Galen of Pergamon in hiswork On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato (Galen, 1978/1980). At the sametime, he takes stance for the unity and incorporeality of the soul. From Galen'sperspective, the parts of the soul are not located in the three bodily organs inan ordinary sense—only their activity takes place there.In Islam, the human soul is also split into three parts: the Qalb (heart), theRuh (blood), and the Nafs (passion of the soul). In the words of Ibrahim Haqqiof Erzurum: the heart is the home of God. Qalb enables the individual toperceive God as the All-Helping and All-Maintaining. Interestingly, the immortalOversoul seed is also felt by the Kahunas to reside in the heart.The Zohar, a classic work of Jewish mysticism, separates three soul parts asneshamah, ruach, and nephesh. They are characterized in this way (Von Rad,1965): Neshamah is the higher soul, or Oversoul. It allows man to have awarenessof the existence and to feel the presence of God. It is the bearer of intellectand provides us the gift of immortality. This part of the soul is implanted atbirth. After death, neshamah returns to the source. Ruach is the middle soul. Itcarries the moral virtues and gives humans the ability to distinguish betweengood and evil. Ruach corresponds to the ego, to the mental-soul in ourterminology. Nephesh is a living mortal essence: it feels pain, hunger, andemotions, and most importantly, it eventually dies. It is the source of one'sphysical and psychological nature. The last two elements of the soul are notgiven at birth but are continuously created over time; their maturation dependson the beliefs and deeds of the person.THE TRIUNE MAN3 [32_chapter23.html#c23-aft3]“Man is a bundle of relations, a knot of roots, whose flower and fruitage is theworld.”—RALPH WALDO EMERSON (1841/1979, p. 20)One could raise a justified doubt about the fundamental basis for using thenotion of the soul at all. As an answer: the Kahuna can “psychodynamize” andelucidate by using the three soul forms, and can even build a healing praxis onthis basis. Of course, this does not necessarily mean that the thing must bemore than just a hollow metaphor (even the phlogiston theory was capable ofexplaining certain phenomena). The Kahunas knew that metaphors work powerfullybecause the body-soul takes everything literally and does not distinguishbetween reality and illusion. It perceives both as real.Rational content can be given to a metaphor by deducing or transferring it intoother metaphors that have been approved in other fields of science. If wediscern a premise which is extremely reductionist and which constricts ouraspects, then questioning the given starting point can take us forward on thecognitive path. What we are questioning here is that our self, our humanessence, and all of our experiences would be reducible to the operation of oneand only one network: the neuroaxonal network. If we accept that othernetworks—operating by other and different types of information processingstrategies—may also contribute to our human essence, then we may reasonablyaddress many concepts that so far have been excluded from the referenceframework of rational thinking.Table 2 summarizes the levels of organization supposedly involved in generationof the conscious experience. Since the topic of consciousness is mostly ignoredby mainstream neuroscience, it is difficult to determine the opinion ofprominent brain researchers. Despite some positive trends in other disciplines(for example, physics), orthodox neuroscientists avoid the issue, and unorthodoxones use the politically correct term awareness when preparing their grantproposals. Nevertheless, with the exception of the very top level and one at thevery bottom, most neuroscientists would not disagree with the assumption thatall these levels represented in Table 2 are involved in the process.To avoid the trap of radical reductionism, one must assume that all levels areat work with bidirectional interrelated causative processes (bottom-up andtop-down reciprocal interactions). Let us pay attention to the position of thedashed line in Table 2. Illustrating the contemporarily accepted view, itdivides levels based upon their assumed causational role in generating theconscious experience.Table 2: Organizational Levels That Play a Role in the Human ExperienceImage [images/p263-01.jpg]According to the theories on the neural correlates of consciousness, theneuroaxonal system has a pivotal role both in the emergence of consciousexperience and in the function of levels above it. In his book, The Blank Slate:The Modern Denial of Human Nature, Steven Pinker (2003, viii) writes, “Cultureis crucial, but culture could not exist without mental faculties that allowhumans to create and learn culture to begin with.” The effect of culture inshaping brain structure and neuroaxonal function is also permitted. In cogentand convincing writing, Bruce Wexler (2006) argues that our brain does notmerely dictate how we respond to changes in the environment but is also itselfshaped through interaction with the social world. Briefly, social relations,even culture and ideology, affect neurobiology.This means that above the dashed line bottom-up and top-down interactions are atwork, and every level is supposed to have an active role. This is not the casebelow it: the assumption here is that subcellular levels are passive, subservinghigher levels by permitting, but not shaping, their function. Here the causationoperates only from bottom-up, but the role of top-down effects is not believedto operate at this level in mainstream neuroscientific thinking. Above thehorizontal line, there is a well-balanced “cooperative hierarchy”; below it,“oligarchy” is the rule. Of course, this is an arbitrary delineation with brokensymmetry. It lacks an explanation about why only the upper half has active andreciprocal interactions. Perhaps it would be more consequent and congruent tosuppose that subcellular levels also have an active role in the creation of thehuman experience and that they add something to the self, which is acharacteristic of their level. Considering their size, this characteristic couldbe their relation with quantum reality.So what is this quantum characteristic that subcellular parts can enrich thehuman experience with? We assume that it is “nonlocality” (more specifically“signal nonlocality”), which is an important property of the quantum processes.In brief, nonlocality means that if two elementary particles were once part ofthe same quantum system, then they remain in immediate interaction, regardlessof their position in space and time. If the quantum state of one particlechanges, then the state of the other quantum entangled particle will also changesimultaneously—no matter how far apart they are from each other in space andtime. “Signal nonlocality”—a new fertile term in 21st-century physics—means thata change in the state of a system induces an immediate change in aninterconnected (entangled) system. A subcellular network (perhaps thelipoprotein membrane complex) might enable the brain to receive “nonlocal”information and to transmit it toward the neuroaxonal network (Figure 1). Atentative function of subcellular components by forming a “quantum arrayantenna” of the brain is discussed in our book (Strassman et al., 2007). Abiological model of information processing is proposed there, in whichsubcellular, cytoskeletal networks serve as the basis for quantum computationand represent a medium of quantum holography.The connection to quantum reality can be mediated by a subcellular network thatpresumably covers the whole body and represents a space- and time-independentholographic image of the Universe inside the body by “nonlocal” connections, inother words, by quantum correlations (Figure 1). “Nonlocal” information aboutthe physical Universe provides the missing link between objective science andsubjective experience, including the mystical experience. Based on the principleof “nonlocality” and with the “quantum array antenna” of subcellular networks,the brain (and the full body) is in resonance with the whole Universe. A fainthologram of the Cosmos emerges inside the body, and regardless how pale it is,it is able to present wholeness and can elucidate teachings like: “The kingdomof God is within you” (Luke 17:21, in Greek, entos hymon), or “Look inside, youare Buddha” (Humphreys, 1987). The perennial wisdom of “As above, so below” (or:“As within, so without”) obtains a fresh perspective and there is hope for theintegration of similar teachings into Western rational thinking. Subcellularmatrix can be the mediator of the Jungian “collective unconscious,” andcytoskeletal quantum holography can explain a very common but obscure phenomenonknown as “intuition.”Figure 1: The hierarchy and speculative interaction of networks related to humanexperiences.Image [images/p265-01.jpg]We represent a radical idea that the world of well-integrated ASCs is related toquantum processes, while the reality of ordinary consciousness belongs—beyonddoubt—to classical physics. Their boundary is probably not sharp at all;ordinary conscious experience can be affected by quantum processes as well (insome cases of intuition), and many features of the experiential world of alteredstates can also be deduced from classical physics. We see a seamless continuumwith phase transitions from the classical-physics based neuronal brain functionsall the way to the quantum-physics based subneuronal “direct intuitive”information processing.While the “nonlocal” connections are permanent, in ordinary states ofconsciousness, there is only a very limited and mostly unconscious shift of the“nonlocal” information into the neuroaxonal system—since the coping apparatus,the “survival machine,” is mostly focused on the more reliable “local” signalscoming from the perceptual organs—so only a little or none can get into thefocus of attention of the “I.” In integrative forms of ASCs (e.g., meditationand contemplation), coping, planning, and task-solving functions are put intothe background along with the agent (ego) bearing those functions. Thus, achance appears for fragments of “nonlocal” information—present already insubcellular networks—to be projected and transferred into the neuroaxonalnetwork and to be experienced also by the ego. This outlined hologram can be astage for out-of-body experiences: consciousness does not leave the body, butits introspective attention sweeps the “matrix,” i.e., the field of “nonlocal”correlations mediated by the subcellular network.In biological systems, everything that involves a transfer of energy (i.e., ofmass—by the Theory of Special Relativity), leads inevitably to a change inspace–time geometry (by the Theory of General Relativity), and shows up bymaking imprints in complex nonbiological networks (spin network—Penrose, 1971.)Where there is a complex network, there must be a function, and an agent can beassigned to that function. Thus, the mental-soul (ego) can be assigned to theneuroaxonal system, the body-soul to the subcellular networks (lipoproteinmembrane complex), and the Oversoul to a nonbiological, basically physicalnetwork (spin network, space–time geometry). The referred native peoples andantique philosophers (namely Pythagoras, Plato, and Galen) may have intuitivelysensed the presence of these network functions representing “agents” in theirsoul concepts. Based on the association above, a careful watch on Figure 1reveals that the presented model reflects quite accurately the dynamics of theKahuna soul forms: the Oversoul (‘aumakua)—the agent of the nonbiologicalnetwork—is in a permanent connection with us in every moment of our lives; thebody-soul (‘unihipili)—the agent of the subcellular matrix—is the bridge betweenthe Oversoul and the mental-soul (‘uhane)—the agent of the neuroaxonalsystem—and serves as an inner portal to receive transpersonal information.Moreover, the model shows an analogy with the Shuar concept in that the arutamwakanl (which corresponds to the body-soul in Table 1) is the bearer of visions.As we have earlier mentioned, biological metabolism, conformation change ofmolecules can affect space–time geometry. By the Kahuna teachings, this can alsohold in reverse: see above the detailed “download” of the Oversoul at theformation of the body-soul.There is another benefit of the presented model—it may explain away theconfusion in the classification of soul components: Soul dualism results fromcombining the biological network agents (life-soul and ego-soul) in contrast tothe nonbiological one (free-soul). The tripartite soul concept emphasizes moretheir unique role and sets the foundation of “soul-dynamic psychotherapy.”Several arguments can be raised against the outlined model questioning thespecial role of each presented network. Within the matrix of the lipoproteinmembranes, is it the microtrabecular lattice that makes humans (and othercellular organisms) capable of carrying an albeit faint hologram of theUniverse, or is it something else? Is it—alternatively—the microtubularcytoskeleton, which is the proposed medium of quantum computation in thePenrose-Hameroff model (Penrose, 1996)? At the bottom rung, others would not putspace–time geometry—an already outdated concept, some experts believe—butentangled quantum holograms in the universal (“Akashic”) field (Laszlo, 2009).Ervin Laszlo argues (personal communication) that space-time is itself amanifestation of the field—there is neither space nor time prior to the quantathat arise in the topological field. Moreover, what functions as the source ofinformation on that fundamental level is not “geometry”—he goes on—but the“nonlocal” network of quantum holograms: the informational structure of thefield. Nevertheless, the strength of our concept is not tied to the successfulproposal of one specific network, but to the argumentation that there must be“nets” other than the neuroaxonal for shaping human experiences, and there mustbe at least three, with one of them being nonbiological.We consider as the miracle of nature not only that the three soul forms can havea material basis—although it can already be unacceptable for many. Theirinteraction, which catapults the human experience to the infinite, fascinates usmore, and so does the fact that a rational explanation can be created even forthis relation-dynamics—although by stretching academic frames. These and similarthoughts are explicated in detail in the book Inner Paths to Outer Space(Strassman et al., 2007) for readers who are open to interdisciplinarytrespasses. As we are not sure about the same attitude at present, we haveshortened our discussion—which may sound cumbersome and far-fetched for many—asmuch as we could. On the other hand, we cannot see any other way toauthentically interpret these and similar teachings. To ignore or to belittlethem is another possible way—but it does not lead to progress. Evidently, theseare concepts and theories that need to be discussed and developed.NOTES1 [32_chapter23.html#c23-ft1].

My position wasinitially based on my work on the Great Sphinx in Egypt. In the early 1990s, Idemonstrated, using geological data, that the statue's origin is thousands ofyears older than the generally accepted date of circa 2500 BCE. Initially, I“conservatively” suggested that the core body of the Sphinx dates back to 5000BCE or a bit earlier. I made my case comparing erosion and weathering profileson the Sphinx to the ancient climatic history of Egypt.In brief, the Sphinx sits on the edge of the Sahara Desert, a hyperarid regionfor the past five thousand years; yet the statue shows substantial rain-inducederosion. The original structure must date back thousands of years prior to 3000BCE (the head was re-carved in Dynastic times). Seismic studies, carried out inconjunction with geophysicist Thomas Dobecki, confirmed that the oldest portionof the Sphinx dates well prior to Dynastic times. Over the years, as I continuedmy studies and collected more data, I slowly revised my estimate, consideringprogressively earlier possible dates for the statue. I am now comfortable withthe notion that possibly the Sphinx's earliest origins go back ten thousandyears or more, perhaps even to the period of circa 10,000 BCE to 9000 BCE; thatis, the end of the last ice age.For many years, one of the harshest criticisms of my redating of the GreatSphinx was that it apparently stood in stark isolation at such a remote periodin time. The people who carved it must have been extremely sophisticatedculturally and technologically. They were civilized. But where was corroborativeevidence of such sophistication, of true civilization, at such an early date?Over the last quarter century, I have traveled to numerous parts of the worldsearching for further evidence that civilization began earlier than standardarchaeologists would have us believe. However, it was not until 2010 that Ivisited Turkey. In Anatolia, I found evidence that demonstrates beyond doubt, inmy assessment, that true civilization arose before the end of the last ice agesome twelve thousand years ago.In southeastern Turkey, there is a site known as Göbekli Tepe. Here, immensefinely carved T-shaped limestone pillars, many in the range of two to five and ahalf meters (two and a half to eighteen feet) tall and weighing up to anestimated ten to fifteen tons, form Stonehenge-like circles. Various pillars atGöbekli Tepe are decorated with bas-reliefs of animals, including foxes, boars,snakes, aurochs (wild cattle), birds, and arthropods (scorpions, ants, orspiders). The level of sophistication seen at Göbekli Tepe clearly, in myopinion, indicates that a true civilization existed here. What is reallyamazing, and corroborates my work on the redating of the Great Sphinx, is theage of Göbekli Tepe. Based on radiocarbon techniques and geological studies, thesite dates back an astounding ten to twelve thousand years ago.The evidence of Göbekli Tepe confirms that civilization dates back to the end ofthe last ice age (circa 9700 BCE), a concept that was unimaginable when I was agraduate student at Yale University back in 1979–1983. And I have come torealize that there may be many things that just might be true even if they oncewere, or for many people still are, unimaginable.In addition to my work pushing back the age of civilization, I have always had adeep and abiding interest in matters of spirit and consciousness—subjects oftenviewed as outside of the domain of serious modern scientists (and I am ascientist, with a PhD in geology and geophysics)—and as a result I haveextensively researched the field of parapsychology.I am commonly asked how my studies in parapsychology relate, if at all, to mystudies of ancient monuments. Even though I am a geologist and my initialconcern was dating various ancient structures, I could not help but wonder whythey were built, especially given the enormous efforts that must have gone intotheir construction. The why behind the monuments, more often than not,apparently included religious beliefs and practices, initiation rites, andrituals, which in many cases seemed to have an ostensible paranormal aspect,whether it was clairvoyance, divination, or manifestations of higher levels ofconsciousness. The temples and tombs of ancient Egypt, Mexico, and Peru seemedto cry out “paranormal.” So was it all a mixture of ancient myth, superstition,and downright fraud on the part of many a seer, priest, and priestess, or couldthere be something to it? Were the ancient structures used, at least in part, toalter consciousness and possibly enhance paranormal phenomena?In all honesty, I have always been highly skeptical of any alleged paranormalphenomena. However, my concept of skepticism is not the same as dismissal, andin my studies of ancient and traditional cultures, alleged paranormal phenomenakept making an appearance. When a former Boston University student, LoganYonavjak, encouraged me to delve deeply into the serious parapsychologicalliterature, I found the topic both fascinating and enlightening. The immediatetangible result of our research was the book The Parapsychology Revolution: AConcise Anthology of Paranormal and Psychical Research, in which we includeselections from fourteen seminal papers, dating from 1886 through 2007, by majorfigures in the field plus a hundred pages of our own commentary. For me,however, the real result of my immersion into parapsychology was a newappreciation for human potentiality and the connections we share with all oflife and ultimately, perhaps, with the cosmos. This is something I address to acertain extent in the final chapter of my latest book, Forgotten Civilization:The Role of Solar Outbursts in Our Past and Future (Inner Traditions, 2012) andI anticipate will be the subject of future articles and books.People often ask me if I now “believe” in the paranormal. Let me just say thatafter looking at the hard evidence, and sifting out the fraud and bunk, I havecome to conclude that there definitely is something to such phenomena astelepathy and psychokinesis. Here I should point out that in The ParapsychologyRevolution, we discuss paranormal and psychical phenomena in a strict sense,including the concepts of ESP (extrasensory perception: telepathy, clairvoyance,and precognition) and psychokinesis (PK, or mind over matter, on both micro andmacro scales). Certain topics that are sometimes included in more generaldefinitions of the paranormal and parapsychology, such as UFOs, aliens, BigFoot, and so forth, were not our concern in this book. Likewise, our primaryfocus did not include evidence bearing on survival beyond the grave (though wedo briefly discuss evidence for reincarnation). The survival issue is highlycontroversial, and the evidence typically used to support life after death issubject to many interpretations. We felt it was important to first establishwhat is possible in terms of paranormal phenomena while people are still alive.Perhaps the survival issue will be the subject of a future book on my part.Most people who have seriously studied the subject conclude that telepathy(mind-to-mind interactions) is the best-supported class of paranormal phenomena.There is strong laboratory evidence for telepathy, such as classic card-callingexperiments as well as many more sophisticated tests of telepathy, clairvoyance,and remote viewing. There is also a large and compelling body of evidence fromspontaneous cases supporting the reality of telepathy. For instance, crisisapparitions, veridical hallucinations, or “ghosts” are well-known, as documentedin the classic two-volume scientific monograph of rigorously authenticatedevents produced by the Society for Psychical Research titled Phantasms of theLiving (first published in 1886; an excerpt from this work is included in TheParapsychology Revolution). The evidence for PK is also strong, includingmicro-PK studies using random event generators and similar devices, such as theevidence developed by the PEAR (Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research) labsover more than a quarter of a century, and the carefully studied incidents ofmacro-PK associated with genuine spontaneous poltergeist cases. Another line ofcompelling evidence for the reality of paranormal phenomena is the study ofpresentiments or “pre-sponses,” essentially a form of shortterm precognition asmeasured by physiological parameters (heart rate, electrodermal activity, and soforth). Numerous replicated experiments have demonstrated the physiologicalresponses of individuals to, for instance, disturbing photographs a second ortwo before they are actually viewed by the person. According to conventionalscience, this should not be possible.As a natural scientist, I expect genuine phenomena (be they psychical andparanormal phenomena, or more conventional phenomena) to exhibit patterns andshare elements in common, and this is just what has been found in spontaneouscases of the paranormal. Even when viewed cross-culturally, such commonalitiespersist.Perhaps even more compelling for me is the work of various modern researchersthat has demonstrated a weak but persistent correlation between low levels ofgeomagnetic activity on planet Earth and cases of apparent spontaneous telepathy(based on records going back to the latter half of the 19th century). This, inmy opinion, is a very strong argument supporting the contention that there issomething genuine to the concept of telepathy. It suggests that spontaneoustelepathic phenomena are real and natural and, as might be expected of naturalphenomena, their manifestation is influenced by other natural parameters.Alternatively, are we to hypothesize that hundreds of hoaxers over nearly acentury and a half have conspired to fake telepathic incidents in identicalcorrelation with geomagnetic activity? This latter hypothesis strikes me asrather far-fetched, if not downright ludicrous. It has also been found thatincidents of the paranormal correlate with Local Sidereal Time (which relates tothe position of the horizon at any particular point on Earth relative to thecenter of our galaxy).Note that a correlation between geomagnetic activity and spontaneous telepathydoes not necessarily imply that the “telepathic signal” is magnetic orelectrical in nature. The human brain is influenced by magnetic and electricfields, and whatever may be the carrier of the telepathic signal, thetransmission, reception, and manifestation of the message by the brain could behampered or enhanced by differences in the magnetic and electric fields that thebrain is subjected to.For many people a phenomenon is not “real” unless it can be duplicated in alaboratory setting under controlled conditions. Being a natural scientist andfield geologist, I have never agreed with this contention. After all, can wecreate a genuine volcanic eruption in the laboratory or even on command in thefield? Until about two centuries ago, the scientific community routinelyrejected the concept of rocks falling from the sky (meteorites). Still,attempting to induce, capture, observe, and experiment with apparent telepathyunder controlled conditions is a worthy endeavor. Unfortunately, however, tothis day it is fraught with problems, and though numerous experiments havetested positive for apparent telepathy, others have had negative results andreplication is a persistent problem. The bottom line is that we really do notknow exactly what parameters or variables make for good telepathic transfer (orthe elicitation of other types of paranormal phenomena), much less how tocontrol for them.There are major issues that remain unresolved concerning paranormal andpsychical phenomena. We don't fully understand what conditions are best toelicit paranormal phenomena, and thus these phenomena are not easily replicatedon command (such as in a laboratory setting). There is often a very lowsignal-to-noise ratio when it comes to psychical phenomena, there is no singlephysical theory to account for paranormal phenomena, and there is the issue offraud and charlatans. Fraud is a very real and persistent problem in the fieldof psychical research, and it's one reason to undertake large statisticalstudies of average persons (as opposed to so-called psychic superstars) andsearch for the regularities and patterns one would expect among any genuinenatural phenomena. Also, paranormal studies have extended to animals (and insome cases, even plants). One of the strengths of nonhuman studies is that it isless likely that animals will cheat and lie. It can also be noted that many“powerful mediums” who appear to have genuine paranormal abilities alsoapparently have low moral values and will cheat and commit fraud, perhapsunconsciously, at times, especially when their genuine paranormal powers fail.This is a pattern that has been noted over and over among parapsychologistsworking with human subjects. All of these topics are discussed in TheParapsychology Revolution.A popular approach to possible paranormal phenomena is simply to dismiss such asimpossible—impossible either in an absolute sense or as being of such a “lowprobability” as to be unworthy of consideration. For example, Sean Carroll(senior research associate in physics at the California Institute of Technology)has posted on his blog, Cosmic Variance, a diatribe against parapsychologistsand the very idea of studying possible paranormal phenomena(http://cosmicvariance.com/2008/02/18/telekinesis-and-quantum-field-theory[http://cosmicvariance.com/2008/02/18/telekinesis-and-quantum-field-theory]).The core of his argument is as follows:The main point here is that, while there are certainly many things that modernscience does not understand, there are also many things that it does understand,and those things simply do not allow for telekinesis, telepathy, etc. Which isnot to say that we can prove those things aren't real. We can't, but that is acompletely worthless statement, as science never proves anything; that's simplynot how science works. Rather, it accumulates empirical evidence for or againstvarious hypotheses. [Italics in the original.]I am classically trained in the sciences, and I understand where Carroll iscoming from philosophically when he states that “science never proves anything”(and I agree that, epistemologically at a deep level, proof is not the domain ofscience). However, Carroll contradicts himself when he states:The crucial concept here is that, in the modern framework of fundamentalphysics, not only do we know certain things, but we have a very preciseunderstanding of the limits of our reliable knowledge. We understand, in otherwords, that while surprises will undoubtedly arise (as scientists, that's whatwe all hope for), there are certain classes of experiments that are guaranteednot to give exciting results—essentially because the same or equivalentexperiments have already been performed. [Italics in the original.]Here Carroll is clearly, and for all practical purposes, arguing that certainthings have been “proven” when he asserts that “we know certain things.” Thisstrikes me as a modern version of the famous (famously wrong) 1894 pronouncementby Albert A. Michelson, 1907 Nobel Laureate in Physics:The more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science have all beendiscovered, and these are now so firmly established that the possibility oftheir ever being supplanted in consequence of new discoveries is exceedinglyremote. . . . Future discoveries must be looked for in the sixth place ofdecimals. (Quoted in Neil deGrasse Tyson, “The Beginning of Science.” NaturalHistory, March 2001.)Michelson made this statement before the elucidation of X-rays and the structureof the atom, and before the discovery of radioactivity and the development ofquantum physics and relativity theory. Despite his scientific brilliance,Michelson did not prove himself a very good diviner of the future.Returning to Sean Carroll, he states, “The main point here is that, while thereare certainly many things that modern science does not understand, there arealso many things that it does understand, and those things simply do not allowfor telekinesis, telepathy, etc.”If in place of “telekinesis, telepathy, etc.” we substitute “continental drift,”I could easily imagine this statement being made in the early 20th century. Thevery concept of moving continents was lambasted from some quarters, despite thestrong evidence in support of the theory, because it was deemed “impossible” andutterly “inconceivable,” based on the science of the time, that continents couldmove. There was no known mechanism, until, that is, the development of platetectonic theory. (Yes, as a geologist, I am aware of the various criticisms andpossible shortcomings of tectonic theory, but that is not the point or issuehere.)Analyzing further the selected quotations from Sean Carroll, they actuallyexpose the weaknesses of like-minded individuals who insist that science in itsmodern Western guise should have the last word or, to put it another way, be thefinal arbiter of truth (even if only a provisional truth). Again, the Carrollquotation is:The main point here is that, while there are certainly many things that modernscience does not understand, there are also many things that it does understand,and those things simply do not allow for telekinesis, telepathy, etc. Which isnot to say that we can prove those things aren't real. We can't, but that is acompletely worthless statement, as science never proves anything; that's simplynot how science works. Rather, it accumulates empirical evidence for or againstvarious hypotheses.To say that something is “worthless” is a value judgment, and in an ultimatesense, one can argue, value judgments are outside of the realm of science anddependent on an emotional investment and context, among other factors. I wouldargue that the fact that “science never proves anything” is quite valuable, asit precludes the “sleight-of-hand” dismissal of the very possibility of anysupposed paranormal phenomena ever being genuine.As far as empirical evidence is concerned, for many people, this is the heart ofthe issue when it comes to alleged paranormal phenomena. Exactly what isevidence? Are anecdotal case studies evidence? Are card-guessing experiments inone lab (with good controls and taking all precautions against possible fraud)which give positive results for telepathy not “evidence,” whereas similarexperiments in a comparable lab (whatever “comparable” is in this case, givenhow poorly we understand the aspects that influence paranormal phenomena) whichgive negative results “solid evidence” against the telepathic hypothesis, assome critics and debunkers would contend? In fact, what is and is not “empiricalevidence” is not a black-and-white matter, either in parapsychology or in manyother scientific disciplines. Rather, evidence—any evidence—is a matter ofdegree and also carries a subjective and value-based component. The criteriathat make for convincing evidence on the part of one person are not necessarilythe same as the criteria for another person. Precluding obvious fraud and thelike, there is no single magical scientific way to determine “objectively” theultimate value of any particular alleged evidence. Science, any science, is notquite as “objective” as some would assert.NOTE1 [33_chapter24.html#c24-ft1].

The seats seem to have been designed like the medievaltorture called “Little Ease” where it is impossible to find comfort in anyposition. I'm due to have my right hip replaced in April and spent thetwelvehour journey in something approaching excruciating pain. What a relief toarrive into the Brazilian summer and be able to stretch my legs!Now we're at the retreat where I had the extraordinary experiences in October2011 that I describe in my article “Giving Up the Green Bitch: Reflections onCannabis, Ayahuasca, and the Mystery of Plant Teachers.” (p. 207) In the comingweeks, together with a group of a dozen other people and our facilitator (whoresists being called a shaman despite his enormous depth of experience), we willparticipate in a series of Ayahuasca sessions. As well as drinking the sacredAmazonian brew and learning the lessons it has to teach me this time around, Iwill be presenting several talks to the group on various aspects of my work. Theother presenter here is the renowned ethnopharmacologist Dennis McKenna, brotherof the late, great Terence McKenna. I first got to know Dennis well during alecture tour that we did together in Australia last year and am looking forwardto renewing the acquaintance and to the further deep connection that sharedjourneys with Ayahuasca always bring. If you haven't read it yet, I urge you toget ahold of a copy of Dennis's new book, The Brotherhood of the ScreamingAbyss, about his life with his remarkable brother Terence, see here:http://www.grahamhancock.com/grapevine/McKennaD1/McKennaD1.php[http://www.grahamhancock.com/grapevine/McKennaD1/McKennaD1.php].So yesterday, Friday, January 24, we rested, relaxed, and recovered from thelong flights we'd all made to get here (the other participants come from as farafield as the Middle East, Australia, and the United States). Today, Saturday,January 25, the work begins with the first all-night Ayahuasca session. I havesome trepidation—as Dennis puts it, anyone who approaches deep work withAyahuasca without at least some trepidation doesn't really know the brew. But Ihave made a sincere effort since October 2011 to implement the changes in mylife and outlook that Mother Ayahuasca required of me. I'm hoping to be handledgently this time and to experience beautiful visions, healing, inspiration, andlove.Above all, love.That, I know from long experience, is the essence of the intelligence behind thevine.I'll report back tomorrow.LETTER 2, SATURDAY, JANUARY 26, 2013So Santha and I are in Brazil for a series of sessions with Ayahuasca, thesacred visionary brew of the Amazon. Ayahuasca means “the vine of the dead” or“the vine of souls.” It is given this name for a number of very good reasons.One is that it can allow the experience of contact with those who have passedon. I make no claims here as to the reality status of that experience, althoughI do have an opinion. Another is that aspects of it are so similar to some ofthe well-known features of the near-death experience, notably a life review,that some feel it may provide us with a dress rehearsal for death itself and forwhatever we may encounter when we pass beyond the veil. Again, while I have myown opinion, I make no specific claims here as to the “reality” of suchexperiences. I give some further thoughts on this in my article “Giving Up theGreen Bitch.”Last night's session was very mild, and for many in the group, it was notvisionary at all. This is sometimes the case with Ayahuasca; one should not gointo a session with expectations of seamlessly convincing and overwhelmingvisions. Often the brew will give you these, but not always, and not reliably.Last night, however, there was an additional factor of uncertainty, and this wasthat the maestros had provided a new batch of the brew that they believed to bevery strong and which was indeed thicker and more syrupy than the brew wenormally drink here in Brazil. It reminded me in its consistency of the veryconcentrated brew, sometimes with bits of plant matter floating in it, usuallyoffered by Peruvian shamans (where, accordingly, rather small cups—about 25milliliters—are the norm). At our Brazilian retreat, on the other hand, it isthe practice to offer a less concentrated brew but in larger doses, and in pastvisits here, I have frequently drunk cups of 100 or 150 and sometimes even 200milliliters.Because last night's brew was new and was said to be strong, our facilitatorproposed cups of just 25 milliliters or less for each of us and we would thendiscover its strength, or otherwise, for ourselves. If it was not as strong asexpected, we could always drink a “booster” cup after an hour and a half or so.The effect was not strong, and after ninety minutes, almost the entire groupqueued up for a booster, again of 25 milliliters. Still, in my case, this hadno—or almost no—effect, and I began to contemplate a third cup. This is not anexact science, and it is never good to be too eager with Ayahuasca. In otherwords, you can go for a booster after experiencing no effect with the first cuponly to discover that it was merely slow kicking in and that suddenly, with thebooster, you have had more than you want. So I waited awhile, but when it wasclear I was still not entering the Ayahuasca realm, I did go for a third cup. Sothree cups, each of 25 milliliters, making 75 milliliters in total.There was no purging—i.e., (apologies for being graphic) neither I nor anyoneelse in the group vomited last night. This is most unusual although I have foundas the years go by that I do purge far less than I used to when I started out.But within half an hour of drinking my third small cup, I did gradually begin toenter visionary space. These visions were mild and a little “flat” ortwo-dimensional by comparison with other fully immersive visions I haveexperienced in the past. The visions were of intricate geometrical and cursivepatterns presented as though on separate individual cards, but when I studiedeach card, the patterns proved to be in movement and resolved into the forms ofentities, rather scary in appearance, and I felt somewhat menaced. Go to GoogleImages, search “Codex Borgia” and/or “Codex Nuttal” and you may get some inklingof the atmosphere, if not the exact details, of these images. I felt myself tobe in the presence of intelligence, and I tried to focus on that intelligencerather than be repelled by the menacing images, and in due course, I moved on tothe next stage of the journey in which I was filled by powerful feelings ofempathy and compassion for my fellow human beings.These feelings began with reflections on the other members of our group who Ihad begun to get to know, and whose stories I had heard, over the past two days.Often in my daily life, I become absorbed selfishly in my own immediate worriesand concerns, certain problems and issues that are confronting me which seem toloom large, and matters that are causing me emotional or spiritual pain. I amincredibly privileged and live a blessed life, yet still I find reasons to feelvictimized or hard done by and sorry for myself ! In an instant last night, Iwas shown how ridiculous and self-indulgent and uncalled for such feelings areas I reflected on what I knew of the difficulties and challenges and realworries and pain that members of our group, in their own ways, are confrontingbravely and without complaint in their own lives. I thought of some cases inparticular, the strength, the dignity, the goodwill, the cheerfulness inadversity, of certain individuals, and I felt myself brimming over withcompassion and love and admiration for them. And it came home to me in a realand immediate way that each one of us here on earth, not only the members of theimmediate group surrounding me in the Ayahuasca session, but every one of thebillions of my fellow humans going through this incarnation in this time arebright and luminous individual flames of light—each with his or her own specialgifts and creativity and imagination, each with his or her own strengths andweaknesses—and every one of us faces challenges and difficulties and ordeals andpain and is confronted daily by defining choices, some small, some momentous,that write the pages of the stories of our lives.And the only right response is gratitude, gratitude, gratitude to the universefor working the high magic that has made it possible for us to travel the pathof human experience, and to learn and grow and develop in the process, and topractice love.LETTER 3, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 30, 2013This is the third of my series of letters about the Ayahuasca sessions I'mpresently participating in here in Brazil. Ayahuasca is a visionary brew thatmarries leaves containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT) with a monoamine oxidaseinhibitor contained in the Ayahuasca vine itself; these two primary ingredientsare cooked together in water to produce a foul-tasting but highly psychoactivebeverage that has been drunk for at least three millennia by the indigenouspeoples of the Amazon rainforest who value it as a portal to the spirit world.In the past decade, it has begun to acquire a global reputation and has beendescribed as “twenty years of psychotherapy in one night.”So our second session took place on the night of Monday, January 28 into thesmall hours of Tuesday, January 29. This time I drank 80 milliliters of the brewin a single cup—as against three doses of 25 milliliters each in the previoussession. With too small a dose of Ayahuasca, it is perfectly possible to have noexperience at all; with too large a dose, it is possible to have an experiencethat is completely overwhelming—perhaps far more so than you would like. It isnot an exact science, and it is complicated further by differences in one's ownbody chemistry from day to day that can result in widely varying effects.I'm here together with a group of more than a dozen people and, as in previousretreats for serious work with Ayahuasca that I've participated in over the lastten years, it is noticeable how close and trusting of one another we havebecome. The Ayahuasca experience has a very special way of doing this—of openingthe heart and breaking down barriers so that you feel intense empathy and a deepconnection with others at a level that is near to impossible in the often angry,often competitive, frequently loveless hustle and bustle and grind of dailylife. It is a great privilege to be able to know this empathy and connection,and it reminds me that all of life could be like this should we consciously setout and be willing to do the work to make it so. It is not oil, or water, ormineral deposits, or food, or land, or any other economic resource that is trulyscarce or precious or “running out” in this bountiful earth of ours. What we areshort of as a global species, what we seem reluctant to manifest, what we arefailing to express and act out, is simply love, and in a way this should be theeasiest problem in the world for us to solve—for it is within the capacity andthe power of each and every one of us to give love if we choose to do so.It is such a good feeling just to lay down the barriers of suspicion and fearand self-interest, and to trust others completely and know that the trust isshared and that the love you put out is the love you get back.So, we all gathered round and raised our cups, mine containing 80 milliliters ofAyahuasca, and thanked the spirits and the ancestors for giving us thisblessing, and drank. I then went to the bathroom and washed the acrid taste ofthe brew from my mouth before sitting down on my mattress with my back proppedagainst the wall of our large ceremonial room surrounded by the rest of ourgroup. Our facilitator turned off the lights and put on a CD of the sounds ofnature—the ocean, rainfall, birdcalls—and through the open windows came a soft,cooling breeze. Stillness descended like a blessing, and for the next half houror so, we all simply sat there staring into the darkness, thinking our thoughts.It is best to sit up at first—some prefer to sit up the whole night—as it allowsswifter and more efficient digestion of the brew than can be achieved lyingdown. Nausea and vomiting commonly accompany the consumption of Ayahuasca, butit is a really good idea not to purge for at least an hour to allow fullabsorption of the medicine from the gut into the bloodstream. Vomit before thehour is up and you will likely need to drink some more brew.Mercifully, as I have become more experienced with Ayahuasca during the past tenyears, I find that I vomit less and less, and usually not at all—although I dostill suffer episodes of nausea.After forty-five minutes, I felt I was ready to lie down and stretched out on mymattress. Music is a constant accompaniment of our sessions here—the facilitatorsensing intuitively the needs and mood and individual journeys of the members ofthe group and adjusting the playlist and his own instrumentals and vocalsaccordingly. He practices within the Peruvian, Shipibo tradition (though theseceremonies are taking place in Brazil), and at the point where I lay down he hadbegun to sing a series of Icaros (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icaro[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icaro]), traditional songs that provide anexcellent waveguide into the profound meditative state that Ayahuasca can bring,or equally Ariadne's threads that can help to lead us out of labyrinths we mightprefer not to find ourselves in.These days, I rarely go into an Ayahuasca session without some fear, and thishas much to do with a terrifying session on pure (smoked) DMT that I had in theUnited States in 2011 (described on my website). The Ayahuasca experience is notthe same as the DMT experience, even though DMT is the primary active ingredientof Ayahuasca, but sometimes a strong Ayahuasca journey will plunge me squarelyback into what I think of as DMT space. I feel vulnerable there, sometimesunprotected by the kindly, healing spirit of the vine, and my fear derives fromthis sense of raw exposure to elemental intelligences.I suppose an hour had passed when I first became definitely aware of the effectsof the brew in the form of intense visuals, seen best (even in the darkness)with my eyes closed. They took shape at first, as they often do, as swirlingpatterns of deep, richly saturated colours, but almost from the first moment,they had the slightly menacing undertones of my 2011 DMT trip. How can Idescribe them? Patches of colour all joined to one another, here purple, hereochre, here a strange deep brownish red, here a luminescent green, hereblue—each patch about the size of a human hand and shaped into oblique,rhomboidal geometric forms, and all joined together in a meaningful swirlingdance. This was not simply the entertaining pattern flow of a kaleidoscope. Thepatterns radiated intelligence, sentience, intent, and I felt my fear rise upanother notch, and at the same time I exercised my will and said to myself, “Iwill not be afraid; I will journey into this without hesitation and see where itleads me.” As soon as I had made that decision, I felt my fear subside and Ijourneyed deeper and then, emerging from the patterns, and shaped out of them,appeared the beautiful, glittering, sinuous form of a serpent seeming to radiatecompassion and concern for me, and I sensed the presence of the great spirit,Mother Goddess of our planet, who I think of as Mother Ayahuasca, and I felt herhealing energy. She worked on me for some time, swirling around my body, fixingparts of me that were broken, right down to the deepest level of my DNA and ofmy psyche.At this point, it was all extremely gentle. I saw faces I did not recognize. Agreat bird, a raptor of some kind, took wing amidst a nimbus of supernal light.The serpent became a jaguar. And still I was not afraid, and I began to think,Well, this is going to be fine. My 80 mililitre cup was just right, just enoughto enter healing visionary space but not so much that the visions wouldoverwhelm me and swallow me up. And as is often the case with Ayahuasca, thevisions came and went in waves—sometimes quite intense, sometimes falling awayalmost to nothingness.I drifted into thoughts about my relationship with my wife, Santha, how I am soblessed to have her in my life, how she is in fact a goddess who manifests inhuman form, and how incredibly privileged I am that she permits me to go throughthis incarnation with her and learn from her how to be a better human being. AndI realized how so much of our life together has been very selfishly about me,about my work, my creativity, my concerns, and it was brought home to me withthe force of a revelation that the next stage of our partnership has to be abouther and that my role now is to be of service to her and help her in every waypossible to express and manifest her own wonderful creative gifts and to fulfillherself.I spent some time in the presence of our children—Santha and I have six childrenbetween us, all young adults now, and they are a tremendous blessing to us andthe light and joy of our lives. And I thought about how wonderful and full oflove they all are, and what good people they are, and I reflected on thestruggles and challenges they face, and the elegant, generous spirit in whichthey are all maturing and developing and travelling their own journeys.Next came thoughts about the state of the world. I found myself dwelling on theterrible, inhuman way the state of Israel behaves toward the Palestinians, andon that hideous wall that Israel has built, and about its constant aggressiveseizure—in the name of God, no less!—of more and more land on which Palestinianfamilies and communities have traditionally lived. The more power we have—andIsrael has immense power—the more it is our responsibility to love, and Irealized that the great task facing Israel now, even though its peoplethemselves feel threatened and fearful and unloved, is to desist forthwith allacts motivated by hatred and fear and to act instead with love and generositytoward all neighbouring peoples, to dismantle that abominable wall, to stopaggressively expanding settlements, and to carry the entire region forward intoa new era based on trust and the mutual benefit of all. It will be difficult,incredibly difficult, and every attack on Israel by those communities thatIsrael has monstrously abused for so long will be used as an excuse and ajustification for more acts of hate and cruelty by Israel itself, but thevicious cycle must be broken, and as the most powerful player on the regionalstage, it falls to Israel to change the destructive, hateful, violent patternthat has been in place for so long. At first, acts of love will be rejected,thrown back in Israel's face, even punished, but love is giving, love ispersistence, love is kind, and if Israel adopts a policy based on love and showsas much kindness and compassion toward non-Israelis—and concern for their needsand interests—as it presently shows toward its own people, then little bylittle, the injuries of the past will heal and a way will be found to bringpeace and security to all humans, regardless of their creed, colour, ethnicorigin, or nationality, whose fate it is to live in that tortured region today.It would be a good thing, I couldn't help thinking, if every military leader,every religious fanatic, every president, every prime minister, every dictatorpresently exercising power in the world were to be required to undergo tensessions of Ayahuasca before being allowed to make a single other decision.By this point in my journey, my head seemed completely clear. I thought thevisions had stopped. I gave thanks that nothing too terrifying had happened tome, and I got up and walked around for a while. As I was walking, however, a newwave of visions descended on me like a storm, and I retreated once again to mymattress where the next phase of my night's journey began.I was immediately in the presence of the entity I saw when I last smoked DMT in2011 and who I think of as “the Trickster” or “the Magician” or “the Sorcerer”and whose aura, quite unlike that of Mother Ayahuasca, is entirely male. I donot know who this entity is or where he comes from. It is perfectly possiblethat he is simply one of the many transformations of Mother Ayahuascaherself—and indeed the healing female spirit that many of us experience throughthe brew is construed as male by a number of traditional cultures in the Amazonrainforest.So there was the Trickster, and he was dancing, dancing, his face long and thin,severe and yet sensual, with steep, angled planes as though drawn by AubreyBeardsley. And he wore a cloak of many colours made up of a patchwork of thosesame richly saturated rhomboidal forms I had seen earlier in the session. Hemade elaborate, skillful, elegant arm movements, as though he held silverthreads in each hand and was stretching these threads out and showing them tome, and it came to me that his dance was the dance of creation and that witheach gesture and movement, he was bringing reality into being—fabricating,generating, and manifesting reality—and that in his dance some kind of immensecosmogenic power was at work.My feelings of fear were very strong now, quite overwhelming, and I wanted toflee, to run away from this scene, to open my eyes wide and stop the visions,but again I exercised my will, placed myself under control, and stayed put tolet this magnificent, terrifying, cosmogenic dance unfold before me. I could notbanish the fear entirely, but I began to realize that perhaps there is nothingto be afraid of here, and then just as this became clear to me, I was overtakenby a giant wave of nausea and had to shuffle round on my mattress and bring upmy bucket to my face (we all have buckets) in case I would vomit.In the end, I didn't vomit and after a few moments the nausea began to subside,and then Santha, who was beside me, suggested that we go out into the middle ofthe floor and dance. Sensing the change in mood, our facilitator began to playrhythmic, vital, energizing music, and other couples and individuals joined usin the clear area of wooden floor at the centre of the room, and I felt no painwhatsoever in my severely osteoarthritic hip, on which I am due to undergosurgery in April, and we danced and danced and were overtaken by joy and thecelebration of the magnificent and generous and precious, precious gift of life.LETTER 4, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2013I make no claim as to the reality status of the entities and realms encounteredin Ayahuasca visions and described in the account that follows. It is possiblethat they are real but only accessible to our senses in altered states ofconsciousness; but it is equally possible that they are projections with nofundamental reality whatsoever. There are many other possibilities, ranging fromarchetypes to the imaginal, that are also worthy of consideration. All I can sayfor sure is that they are experienced as real, and I claim nothing more thanthat.I'm still in Brazil, still working with Ayahuasca. See earlier letters in thisseries for my accounts of sessions one and two.Our third session took place on the night of Wednesday, January 30, 2013, intothe small hours of Thursday, January 31. I drank the same dose, 80 mililitres,that had taken me on a complex and thought-provoking journey during the secondsession, but this time the effects were very different. Perhaps it was themusic, which often sounded to me like panes of glass being broken with a hammer,or sometimes like a pneumatic drill breaking up a road, but I was for a longwhile completely unable to drift into a visionary state. I felt distressed andunhappy, with a slight admixture of relief that at least I would not have toconfront the entity I call the Trickster that night.This absence of visions, which I experienced as a gulf, a void, seemed to go onfor a very long while, but gradually an odd state of mind began to overtake me.I had glimpses of a whole other life that I was living somewhere else, where Iwas me and yet had a different biography from the one that defines me in thislife. I knew different people, did different things, and was living out thatparallel life completely oblivious to this one. So it was an odd thing, lying inthe darkness in our ceremonial space here in Brazil, under the influence ofAyahuasca but not very much—if at all—carried away by visions, to experiencethese strange episodes of crossover, of intersection, in which I became aware ofboth lives simultaneously, with each life seeming like a dream—ephemeral,fleeting, and yet haunting—that I was experiencing in the other.I stood, visited the bathroom, and came back to my mattress. I could not shakethe feeling of being haunted. Then dizziness swept over me and suddenly,precipitously, as though falling off a cliff, I tumbled into the realm ofvision.It was as though I were within a gigantic serpent. Its body, which had engulfedme, was transparent, allowing me to see through the patterns of its skin intothe room beyond. At the same time, the feelings of unhappiness and distress thathad set in very early in the session remained with me, and I found that I wasunable to surrender to the experience as I knew I should and unable to master myfear. I was haunted by that dream world that was my other life, suspecting thatin some way something, some entity, some intelligence was seeking to possess meand not liking or welcoming that feeling at all.I continued to wrestle with it. I would not surrender to it, and at the sametime, it would not leave me alone.Eventually, I went down to the kitchen and dining area, where in the wintermonths, there is often a fire for participants to gather round in the latestages of a session. Tonight, in the Brazilian summer, there was no fire, butother members of our group were already there, and I fell into a conversationwith them that helped to distract me from my haunted state and draw me out,little by little, into a sense of normality with myself.Our fourth session took place on the night of Saturday, February 2 into thesmall hours of Sunday, February 3. I drank 90 millilitres of a different batchof the brew. The effects were immediately powerful but quite pleasant. Not atall threatening. I felt strongly the presence of Mother Ayahuasca, MotherGoddess of our planet, guardian of the great forests and of the wise and ancienttrees, spirit of the oceans in her manifestation as Yemanja, the Blue Angel,whose special day in Brazil is February 2.Time passed. The brew worked its way through me, and I tottered out to thebathroom, sat myself on the throne (sorry to be graphic, but it is not fornothing that Ayahuasca is also called “the purge” in the Amazon), and lost trackof time there. It was absurd in a way. There I was sitting on the toilet, doingthis very mundane and earthy thing, and at the same time, I could feel thepresence of Mother Ayahuasca, of this deeply compassionate, unutterablybeautiful goddess who became present to me in her serpent form and seemed towrap me up in her coils and just loved me, loved me, for the longest while. Iwas very strongly given the message that I am too hard on myself, that I do notappreciate myself enough, that, yes, I have made errors in my life, yes, I havecaused pain to others—as we all do—but that I am, nonetheless, fundamentally agood person and that perhaps the time has come for me to stop beating myself upabout my mistakes and even to celebrate myself.So I was surrounded by this lovely warm energetic glow, and I took it with mewhen I returned to the ceremonial space. My intention was simply to lie quietlyback on my mattress and resume my discourse with Mother Ayahuasca, and ifpossible to experience even more of that healing love that she had bestowed onme. Instead, however, I gradually became aware of the malevolent attention ofsomeone . . . or something.After my encounter with the Mother, I still felt full of confidence, protectedby a great and powerful Goddess, able to handle whatever was thrown at me, butat this precise moment, I came under an intense and focused psychic attack, andmatters grew very strange. I was still in the ceremonial room in Brazil, but atthe same time, I was not—as though everything had been shifted half a step tothe side into some parallel dimension that had always been there, overlappingwith ours, but had hitherto remained unseen. So at one and the same moment, Iwas in my body, on my mattress in the ceremonial space, and at the same time,out of my body in this other simulacrum of the room half a step to the side onanother plane of reality.The entity that was attacking me stood very close to me. It had human form—infact, it looked like one of the other members of our group, but it wasimmediately obvious that it was not a physical being.Was it the Trickster again?Sparks of light flashed from its eyes, and there was sorcery in its hands andits gestures, and the confidence I had felt just moments before that I would beable to handle this malevolent force, that I might somehow meet it on equalterms and defend against it, was blown away like mist. I realized I wascompletely powerless and incompetent in its presence, utterly overmastered byit, out of my league. If this were a spiritual dojo, I would be the novicewearing the white belt and this thing, whatever it was, would be the ninth danblack belt here to wipe the floor with me.I tried projecting love at it. It wouldn't work. The sense of threat and dangercontinued to mount. I tried to invoke Mother Ayahuasca in her manifestation asthe Blue Angel. This did no good at all. I tried to raise a barrier of light.Failure again. Finally, my out-of-body self just curled up into a ball while Iwas pummeled and beaten and humbled on that etheric plane.I endured the continuing psychic attack for a while, but then when I could bearit no longer, I decided the only course open to me was to leave the room, so Istaggered out—the Ayahuasca was very strong, and I was a little unsteady on myfeet—went downstairs, across the dining area, and out through the porch into thelush tropical gardens that surround this property.Immediately, the atmosphere changed again, the psychic attack ceased, and I wasin the domain of Mother Ayahuasca. I walked amongst the trees and bushes,touching each one, and entered into some kind of intense communion.Scintillating light and patterns, alive with energy, filled with sentience,sparkling with magic, emanated from every leaf, every branch, and I was, for thelongest time, completely surrounded by and immersed in enchantment and beauty.Later as I began to process the experience and talked with others in the group,it became clear that everyone had experienced a powerful, unusual, trulyextraordinary night.And I thought, Well, working with Ayahuasca is sometimes very strange, and itcan be terrifying, and one faces challenges not often met in everyday life, butwhat an incredible blessing it is and what an incredible opportunity it is tolearn and grow and develop and fortify oneself against the dangers of this andother realms. And I thought about the entity I had encountered, the Trickster inone of his many disguises and my lost bout in that spiritual dojo, and Isuddenly realized that I had not lost at all—I had gained an important lesson,and I no longer felt afraid.LETTER 5, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2013Warning before you begin reading: In what follows, I am reporting experiencesand also interactions with others. I give my interpretations of thoseexperiences and interactions, but I make absolutely no claim that myinterpretations are correct.Very strange and disturbing events around our fifth Ayahuasca session here inBrazil, which took place on the night of Monday, February 4 into the small hoursof Tuesday, February 5.I mentioned in my previous letter on this subject that during the fourthsession, something happened to me that I experienced as an intense and focusedpsychic attack. To provide context, I cite extracts from that account here:I was still in the ceremonial room in Brazil, but at the same time, I was not—asthough everything had been shifted half a step to the side into some paralleldimension that had always been there, overlapping with ours, but had hithertoremained unseen. So at one and the same moment, I was in my body, on my mattressin the ceremonial space, and at the same time, out of my body in this othersimulacrum of the room half a step to the side on another plane of reality.The entity that was attacking me stood very close to me.

Sparks of lightflashed from its eyes, and there was sorcery in its hands and its gestures, andthe confidence I had felt just moments before that I would be able to handlethis malevolent force, that I might somehow meet it on equal terms and defendagainst it, was blown away like mist.

Now just before the start of the fifth session,something even stranger and utterly unexpected happened. Having already statedour individual intentions for the evening, we began to queue up to receive ourcups of the brew from our facilitator.Often during this moment, members of the group embrace and wish one another agood and safe journey; that is quite normal. But this evening, I heard a suddencry of shock and one of the women in our group—I must respect privacy and willnot name her—protested that another member of the group, a man (again, no names)had approached her making a series of bizarre and threatening hand gestures andat the same time projected his breath forcefully into her face. For those of usfamiliar with Amazonian shamanic traditions, it was immediately obvious thatthis was a very serious act, for it is by blowing with the mouth that thebrujos—sorcerers—of the Amazon project the magic pathogenic darts known asvirotes at their enemies in order to do them harm. Virotes may also be projectedthrough a sorcerer's arms and out of openings in his hands.“Did you do that to anyone else?” asked the woman who had been the victim ofthis sinister assault.The man admitted that he had not.“Then why did you do it to me?” she asked.“I was blessing you,” he said.“I don't even let my husband blow in my face like that,” she objected, “and Icertainly didn't ask for your blessing! What were you trying to do to me?”“Pah!” he replied, turning his back “You wouldn't understand.”It seemed that what had been, just a few days before, a peaceful, trusting,cooperative group had suddenly been exposed to some malignant energy or intent.And for me, the strangest thing of all—the very strangest thing—was that the manwho had blown into the woman's face, who had so aggressively stepped into herspace and infringed her sovereignty, was the very same man I had been attackedby the night before in my visions.Except then I had convinced myself that it could not be him (“It had human form,in fact it looked like one of the other members of our group, but it wasimmediately obvious that it was not a physical being.”).Now, I was not so sure.After such a disruption of the flow, it would probably have been wise if no onehad drunk the brew that night but, having come so far, we all did, including thewoman who had been assaulted—although she asked our facilitator to clear thenegative energy that she felt had been projected at her first.I took my largest dose yet in this series of sessions, 100 milliliters, composedmyself for whatever lay ahead, and instantly regretted drinking so much. In theend, however, I was hyperalert, jangled, and so afraid that whenever an intensevisionary state threatened to creep up on me, I resisted it, actively andconsciously fought against it, and willed it away. The plain truth was that Idid not wish to become vulnerable again to that malevolent force that hadovermastered me and psychically bullied and terrified me during the previoussession, and since it could not get at me in the physical realm, but only in thevisionary or astral realm, my instinct was not to allow myself to go there.And I found myself wondering, What are we dealing with here? Is it in fact whatit appears to be? Is this individual who tonight so blatantly transgressed thesovereignty of another member of the group in physical space, somehowmanifesting a spirit body and using it to transgress also on the astral plane?Or is it, as I originally suspected, some powerful etheric entity that is nothim at all but simply disguising itself as him? Or could it be a bit of both?Could he be a weak, perhaps psychopathic, individual who has made some sort ofFaustian bargain with a dark and hungry supernatural force and is serving as amore or less willing lightning rod to channel it to others around him? Or mightit be none of the above?Here, before going further, I feel compelled to repeat that I make no claim asto the reality of the entities and realms encountered in Ayahuasca visions. Itis possible that they are real but only accessible to our senses in alteredstates of consciousness; but it is equally possible that they have nofundamental reality whatsoever. There are many other possibilities, ranging fromarchetypes to projections to the imaginal, that are also worthy ofconsideration. All I can say for sure is that they are experienced as real, andI claim nothing more than that.About two hours into the session, we all heard a crashing sound somewhere below.Along with our facilitator and a couple of others, I hurried down the stairs,and we found another member of our group, a strong young man in his earlythirties, collapsed on the floor. He said he did not understand what hadhappened to him. Something dark had attacked him, swarmed over him, overpoweredhim, and he had felt certain he was going to die unless he got out of theceremonial space. On the way down the stairs, he had become faint and fallen. “Ilooked death in the face,” he kept on saying. “I looked death in the face.”Our facilitator went to work on him. There are certain techniques—the use of arattle, a thumb placed firmly on the center of the brow, the chanting of thespecial songs called icaros—which are helpful in clearing away negative psychicenergies and, after about half an hour, the young man was able to stand and walkaround. “I looked death in the face,” he repeated—but this time with asmile—“and I survived.”Later in conversation, our facilitator told us that when he had begun to work onthe young man, he himself had been seized by a feeling of absolute terror—apowerful and overwhelming dread that he was only able to master with greatdifficulty and by drawing on everything he had learned in more than forty yearsof working with the brew.Later still, another member of our group, a trained psychotherapist who is alsoenormously experienced with the sacred use of psychedelics, came down from theceremonial space to join us in the kitchen, took a seat, and said calmly andreflectively: “What the hell was that?” He then reported that he too had beenterrorized in the visionary realm by some dark entity that he too associatedwith the individual who had blown in the woman's face at the beginning of theceremony. “I tried very hard to rationalize what was happening,” he said. “Itried to convince myself that what I was experiencing was just my own shadowside taking illusory form, that this was something I was projecting, but in theend, I became certain it was a real force, something utterly alien and deeply,deeply evil and completely external to myself. I tried every technique I know tokeep it at bay, but nothing worked.”The following day, I talked to the individual who had blown in the woman's face.“I'm a basement shaman,” he said. He sounded quite proud of himself. “I make DMTand smoke it a lot at home, exploring visionary worlds, and I go aroundAyahuasca groups doing this work. Sometimes people don't like it, but I justwithdraw within myself so they can't get to me.” He told me he hoped Iappreciated how much courage it took for him to talk to me openly like thisabout the disruption his behavior had caused. I told him that my advice was thathe should cultivate humility and not imagine that he has any “work” to do withanyone else, only with himself. After speaking to me, he spoke to the womanwhose sovereignty he had transgressed the night before and apologized to her,again repeating that he hoped she appreciated what tremendous courage it tookfor him to come out in the open like this. She found herself unable to accepthis apology. “You're trying to make it all about you,” she told him, “with allthis crap about your courage. That's not a genuine apology at all.”Two days later, mercifully, the man left. Indeed, most of the group has nowgone. Just seven of us remain for the final two sessions, the first of whichtook place on the night of February 10 into the small hours of February 11. Itwas a blissful, openhearted night with a great feeling of love, security,solidarity, and trust. I am not going to describe it further here except to saythat the same member of our group who had asked, “What the hell was that?” afterthe fifth session had a new insight during the night. He experienced a direct,personal encounter with the loving entity whom we call Mother Ayahuasca (who isperhaps a goddess, though she does not wish to be worshipped), and he asked herthe same question: “What the hell was that thing that attacked us during thefifth ceremony? Why did we have to go through that?”“You needed to see it,” she replied. “Now you know what I have to deal with allthe time. It's the evil that is loose in the world, twisting and destroying thehuman spirit, and I need your help to fight it, the help of good peopleeverywhere, the help of the power of love.”I realize how strange all this must sound to those (undoubtedly the vastmajority who read this) who have not drunk Ayahuasca and perhaps do not wish to.All I can say, as my good friend Dennis McKenna puts it, is that Ayahuasca isthe ultimate skeptic's challenge. It is not an intellectual argument. It is nota matter of empirical, scientifically verifiable proofs. It is quite simply anexperience. Once you've had a deep and powerful encounter with the brew, you canmake of it what you will, but until you have had such an encounter, it is betterto withhold judgment.I hope with these personal accounts that I have added some quantum of usefuldata to the body of available information about the Ayahuasca enigma. I have notheld back and have shared with you both the dark and the light sides of therealm of experience into which this mysterious, ancient, and sacred Amazonianbrew can plunge us. It is as though a doorway is opened into a parallel universein which—as in the universe we inhabit in our daily lives—there is both good andevil, but in which—both there and here—we as conscious human creatures aregifted with the power of choice. Sometimes we must face evil, sometimes it maydo us harm, but we do not have to join forces with it, we do not have to makecompromises with it, we do not have to bow down to it, and we do not have toserve its purposes. Evil cannot always be defeated, but it can always—always!—beresisted.So the Ayahuasca experience is by no means all sweetness and light, and if yougo into a session with that naïve expectation, you may well, at some time orother, find yourself unpleasantly surprised. Ayahuasca is extremely seriousbusiness, and this is one among many reasons why I would not advise anyone topartake of it without skilled and well-intentioned shamanic guidance—though suchguidance, these days, is available from a small but growing number of goodwilledand completely un-egotistical Western shamans as well as from Amazonian shamans.Indeed, the fact that a self-styled “shaman” hails from the Amazon is noguarantee whatsoever of the quality of care and service he will provide; inthis, as in all adventurous journeys where hazards can be expected, you shoulddo your research carefully, consult others, and rely on word of mouth beforecommitting yourself to a particular path.With these necessary cautions expressed, however, I conclude by affirming thatthe Ayahuasca experience is, above all else, about love and that there isopenness of heart in it and a tremendous sweeping away of the blockages andmechanisms of denial that prevent us from getting to grips with and resolvingfundamental issues in our lives. Truly, it is not for nothing that a very strongAyahuasca session has been described as twenty years of psychotherapy in onenight! In this regard, I have already set before readers here the radical changein my own life initiated by a series of Ayahuasca experiences I had duringOctober 2011—see my article “Giving Up the Green Bitch: Reflections onAyahuasca, Cannabis and the Mystery of Plant Teachers.” (p. 207)And above and beyond all that, as I've tried to show, the great virtue andpromise of Ayahuasca is that it raises profound questions about the nature ofreality itself. There are, as yet, no definite answers to thosequestions—perhaps there never will be—but to confront the experiences that giverise to them, while sometimes terrifying and often chastening, is, I believe,ultimately of the greatest value.NOTE1 [34_chapter25.html#c25-ft1]. These five letters, originally written as statusupdates for my Facebook community, describe a series of sessions with Ayahuasca,the “vine of souls” that I participated in in Brazil in January and February2013. They are written in real time and reflect the changing dynamics of theseunusual experiences over a period of two weeks. Something very strange happenedin sessions four and five, something sinister that I could not have anticipatedfrom my previous work with Ayahuasca, and looking back through the wholesequence of letters now, I am struck by how it took me, and others, by surpriseand how we at first sought to intellectualize it and even explain it away."},{"pageContent":"COULD PSYCHEDELICS SAVE THE WORLD?BY GREGORY SAMSThe psychedelic experience appears to have been, at one time or another, partand parcel of human cultures throughout the world; with or without assistancefrom the plant world, and usually with. Today, as our civilization careensmindlessly out of control and we face rejection by the planet that is our onlyhome, it is appropriate to ask whether the virtual absence of the psychedelicexperience in modern culture might be connected with the predicament in which wefind ourselves.The fields of ecology and green consciousness are products of the sixties hippymovement, now branched and developed far beyond the first “back to the land”aspirations of the time. Before then, a few select and far-sighted individualsprimed the pump, from Rachel Carson to Bertrand Russell, Aldous Huxley to GeorgeOhsawa. But it was the wholesale ingestion of psychedelics that enabled largenumbers of a new generation to break out of a mental straightjacket that hasconstrained our dominant Western thought processes for far too long.Psychedelics can transport us into an unfamiliar space. The familiar world inwhich we live, with houses, plumbers, parliaments, cell phones, cars,advertising, restaurants, and so forth is but one channel on the set of allpossible channels. Because this is the reality we have created within the worldaround us, we are tuned to it to such a degree that we easily become obliviousto the deeper nature of this intricately interwoven world, of which we are but apart, living upon our little speck of dust within the Universe.The psychedelic experience is not embraced as an escape from our world but as aticket to escape from the single channel; to see the bigger picture and thesmaller picture; to see our world from a different perspective, even from adifferent dimension. It is hard to emerge from this voyage without developing arealization, amongst many others, that those “in power” are possessed of anarrow vision fuelled primarily by the desire to stay in power. Their viewpointis of one channel only—the one that represents the status quo they understand,in whatever country they control—and their efforts to control and fine-tune thischannel to a micro-degree can often appear ludicrous.The “alternative” culture that developed in the sixties was the firstmass-movement to recognize that the channel we are tuned to is incompatible withthe fostering of health, happiness, or peace and goodwill among humankind.Perhaps we did not recognize the coming of climate change and the scale of thethreat. But we certainly recognized, through a new and spiritual perspective,that our communal ship was in danger of sinking. The state's natural responsewas to do everything in its power to prevent us from building lifeboats, to stopus from tuning in to new and experimental channels. And what may have mostfrightened the maintainers of the status quo was the prospect of a generationwho were inserting flowers into gun barrels; embracing threatening concepts likelove, peace, oneness, and nonviolence; looking inside themselves; and rejectinga nine-to-five future as tax-paying consumers in an untenable endless-growtheconomy. Who would need Big Government anymore? The psychedelic experiencereconnected us with our inner self and a world of spirit; with concepts such asharmony and good vibrations; practices such as meditation and yoga; values suchas conservation and recycling; organic farming and natural eating; alternativehealing techniques from acupuncture to herbal and the laying on of hands. It isdifficult, today, to imagine just how grey and disconnected from our truereality was the pre-sixties culture of the Western world. Opening the doors ofperception in those days was a much greater surprise than it is today. Yet it isdepressing to see just how little has changed in the core mind-set of those whoprofess to run our world; those who rely upon the power of coercion andpropaganda to achieve their ends; those who ban cannabis and psychedelic drugs;those who seek to restrict and even ban the expression of dissent and protest;those who would drill holes in the lifeboats.But how did we get disconnected in the first place—how did we get to the pointwhere things that come naturally would be part of an “alternative” culture—be a“movement” instead of the mainstream? In the same way that we would not need anutritional supplements industry were our food not refined and denatured in thefirst place, there would be little need for ecological awareness and a greenmovement had our culture not come to be isolated and disconnected from the worldaround it.Though our profligate consumption of the world's oil reserves can easily be seenas a root cause of our ecological crisis, it is important to recognize that ourdisconnection from the planet was in place long before the Age of Oil. It iscomplex, bordering on the impossible, to conceive just how the discovery ofcheap and transportable power would have impacted upon a culture that had notbanned shamans and the shamanic experience. Those who developed the oil industrywere of the same stock as those who slaughtered herds of buffalo in order tosell their tongues, the same who would destroy beautiful landscapes to extract afew pounds of yellow metal, the same who ardently believed in a universal godwhose prime purpose lay in producing, providing for, and monitoring the humanrace.Perhaps we can track the original suppression of the shamanic, psychedelicexperience right back to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, described in theBible's opening pages, and the most commonly known Bible story of all. In thisfundamental story, the fruit-pushing snake is portrayed as an agent of the darkside for telling Eve that “when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and youwill be like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3). The snake, of course, hasbeen symbolic of knowledge and divinity across many religious and shamanictraditions throughout the world. An angry God, as punishment for beingdisobeyed, visits toil and suffering upon the human race thereafter, especiallytargeting women by promising to “greatly multiply your pain in childbearing” anddecreeing that men shall “rule over you.” It's a peculiar story, to be sure, andone that has impacted upon us ever since.An alternative interpretation of this Adam and Eve story was held by thewidespread Gnostic sects known as the Ophites, who revered and recognized theserpent as man's benefactor and saw Jehovah as the bad guy who sought to keep usin ignorance by denying us knowledge of our potential divinity. The Ophites weredeclared heretics and brutally extinguished by the spread of an organized andintolerant Christianity in the 4th century. One could be forgiven for suggestingthat had our species embraced the serpent's gift, we might still be living inharmony with each other and our planet—enjoying life in the paradise that weinhabit. Instead, a lack of differentiation between good and evil seems to bethe hallmark of those in power today.The powerful post-Constantine Church claimed a monopoly on spirituality, banningor destroying anything they thought to be in conflict with their religioushegemony. Witchcraft, astrology, spiritualism, soothsaying, and worshipping theSun or Moon could all get one into serious trouble. A patent was effectively putupon the ecstatic state, with punishment meted out to those caught seeking a“religious” experience by any means other than those approved by the Church.The psychedelic experience and shamans were out—thought control was in. A selectgroup of people now decided what we could think and how we should behave,assuming a mandate from God to do so. The natural world was not supposed to beable to teach us things, and our intuition was not to be trusted in matterswhich had been divinely decreed, or decreed by those who claimed divineresponsibility to do so. We could use our intellect to learn about the naturalworld, usually for the purpose of exploiting it, but that world itself wasstupid and could not inform us, and to believe it could was to indulge insuperstitious pagan behaviour. That was a dangerous place to be.The natural world had been provided by our divine creator as little more than astore cupboard for humanity. A common mind-set believed that we werespecifically given “dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of theair, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thingthat creepeth upon the earth” as well as “every herb bearing seed, which is uponthe face of all the earth, and every tree, etc.” It says it all, right there inthe Bible (Genesis 1).A consequence of this assumption of human dominion over all was to investWestern civilization with a God-given license to take from this planet withunabashed greed, wiping out species and blithely destroying landscapes andcultures in the process of “developing” them. Humanity was relieved of the needto show any consideration or thought to the land or its other residents, exceptfor their utility to the intelligent human race. Everything else in the Universewas seen as stupid or inanimate, other than creatures kind of like us, and thedenizens of Heaven. It is becoming more and more apparent that this viewpoint isungrateful, thoughtless, plain stupid, and as damaging to us as it is to theplanet that hosts us. Yet it has infused the culture of the so-called“developed” world for seventeen centuries.Doors opened by the psychedelic experience allow us to blow this cripplingmental straightjacket right out of our mind space, revealing a world moreinterconnected, alive, and wonder-filled than we had ever realized; a world inwhich we may feel like gods, but not a world that we can rule over likedeterministic kings; a world that is our host and teacher as well as ourconscious provider. We learn to respect the world, and wonder at how we couldhave ever done otherwise.For the shaman in all of us, spirit is out there and is as real a part of ourworld as the physical stuff we can see and touch. When we recognize the spiritin the trees, the spirit in the mountain, the spirit in the earth and the Sunand its fellow stars, we live in harmony and respect with our environment—itcomes naturally."},{"pageContent":"PERMISSIONS/CREDITSAlivernia, Mike. “DMT—The Final Frontier.” Reprinted with permission from MikeAlivernia.

Schoch, a full-time faculty member at the College of GeneralStudies at Boston University since 1984, earned his Ph.D. (1983) in Geology andGeophysics at Yale University. In the early 1990s, Dr. Schoch stunned the worldwith his revolutionary research that recast the date of the Great Sphinx ofEgypt to a period thousands of years earlier than its standard attribution. Indemonstrating that the leonine monument has been heavily eroded by water despitethe fact that its location on the edge of the Sahara has endured hyper-aridclimactic conditions for the past 5,000 years, Schoch revealed to the world thatmankind's history is greater and older than previously believed. More recentlyDr. Schoch has determined the astronomical cause of the demise of antediluviancivilizations, which he describes in his book Forgotten Civilization: The Roleof Solar Outbursts in Our Past and Future, along with the scientific andarchaeological evidence that supports his conclusions.

He has spent most of his life researching the fundamental geometry ofhyperspace.Combining this knowledge with a keen observation of nature, he discovered aspecific geometric array that is fundamental to creation. His unificationtheory, known as the Haramein–Rauscher Metric (a new solution to Einstein'sfield equations that incorporates torque and Coriolis effects), and his recentpaper “The Schwarzschild Proton” lay down the basis of what could be afundamental change in our current understandings of physics and consciousness.In the past 20 years, Mr Haramein has directed research teams of physicists,electrical engineers, mathematicians and otherscientists. He founded anon-profit organisation, The Resonance Project Foundation, where as Director ofResearch he continues exploring unification principles and their implications.The foundation is actively developing a research park in Hawai'i which combinesscience, sustainability and green technology.Nassim Haramein has been giving lectures and seminars on his theory for morethan 10 years.Russell Brand is an English comedian, actor, radio host, author, and activist.Gregory Sams is a pioneer of food for the body and food for the mind.

Roberts was born in Tacoma, WA. The value of seeking the truthwherever it may be found was instilled in him at a very young age. At 7 yearsold he was street preaching in Salt Lake City, Utah and by 10 years old he hadtraveled to China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Macau and The Philippines as amissionary. Having grown up in a fundamentalist Christian environment, hisperspective on the world was greatly influenced by the Bible and thefundamentalist view of its teachings. Having come to adulthood, Gabriel movedfrom his hometown of Tacoma to the more cosmopolitan Seattle to get his theologydegree at Seattle Bible College. Through his studies and endeavors to live thetruth and find a spiritually fulfilling life, Gabriel felt that there must besomething more to the story than a contest of sin and salvation. After manyyears of study and with a lifetime of effort to connect with something greater,Gabriel stepped away from his Christian faith. The details and reasons arecatalogued in his book, Born Again To Rebirth. Like many others who have had anearnest thirst for the answers to the big questions of life, Gabriel was notsatisfied to settle for not knowing more.
