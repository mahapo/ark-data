It is a monolith, carved out of the limestonebedrock of the Giza plateau, two hundred and forty feet long, thirty-eight feetwide across the shoulders, and sixty-six feet high. It is worn down and eroded,battered, fissured and collapsing. Yet nothing else that has reached us fromantiquity even remotely matches its power and grandeur, its majesty and itsmystery, or its sombre and hypnotic watchfulness.It is the Great Sphinx.Once it was believed to be an eternal God.Then amnesia ensnared it and it fell into an enchanted sleep.Ages passed: thousands of years. Climates changed. Cultures changed. Religionschanged. Languages changed. Even the positions of the stars in the skieschanged. But still the statue endured, brooding and numinous, wrapped insilence.Often sand engulfed it. At widely separated intervals a benevolent ruler wouldarrange to have it cleared. There were those who attempted to restore it,covering parts of its rock-hewn body with blocks of masonry. For a long periodit was painted red.By Islamic times the desert had buried it up to its neck and it had been given anew, or perhaps a very old, name: ‘Near to one of the Pyramids,’ reportedAbdel-Latif in the twelfth century, ‘is a colossal head emerging from theground. It is called Abul-Hol.’ And in the fourteenth century El-Makrizi wroteof a man named Saim-ed-Dahr who ‘wanted to remedy some of the religious errorsand he went to the Pyramids and disfigured the face of Abul-Hol, which hasremained in that state from that time until now. From the time of thisdisfigurement, also, the sand has invaded the cultivated land of Giza, and thepeople attribute this to the disfigurement of Abul-Hol.’[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image001.jpg]1. Profile of the Great Sphinx from the south showing restoration blocks alongthe paws and flanks and extensive weathering on the core limestone body.Enduring memoriesAbul-Hol, the Arabic name for the Great Sphinx of Egypt, is supposed by mosttranslators to mean ‘Father of Terror’.An alternative etymology, however, has been proposed by the Egyptologist SelimHassan. During the extensive excavations that he undertook on the Giza plateauin the 1930s and ‘40s he uncovered evidence that a colony offoreigners—‘Cananites’—had resided in this part of Lower Egypt in the earlysecond millennium BC. They were from the sacred city of Harran (located in thesouth of modern Turkey near its border with Syria) and they may perhaps havebeen pilgrims. At any rate artefacts and commemorative stelae prove that theylived in the immediate vicinity of the Sphinx—worshipping it as a god under thename Hwl.[1] [index_split_036.html#filepos767500]In the Ancient Egyptian language, bw means ‘place’. Hassan therefore reasonablyproposes that Abul-Hol, ‘is simply a corruption of bw Hwl, “the Place of Hwl”,and does not at all mean “Father of Terror”, as is generally supposed’.[2][index_split_036.html#filepos767691]When speaking of the Sphinx, the Ancient Egyptians frequently made use of theHarranian derivation Hwl, but they also knew it by many other names: Hu,[3][index_split_036.html#filepos767775] for example, and Hor-em-Akhet—which means‘Horus in the Horizon’.[4] [index_split_036.html#filepos767974] In addition, forreasons that have never been fully understood, the Sphinx was often referred toas Seshep-ankh Atum, ‘the living image of Atum,[5][index_split_036.html#filepos768287] after Atum-Re the self-created sun-god, thefirst and original deity of the ancient Egyptian pantheon. Indeed, the very name‘Sphinx’ that has haunted the collective subconscious of the Western world sinceClassical times, turns out to be no more than a corruption—through Greek—ofSheshep-ankh.In this way, with subtlety, a number of very archaic ideas, once held by theancient Egyptians, have survived for thousands of years.[6][index_split_036.html#filepos768573] Would we not be foolish, therefore, toignore entirely the lingering tradition that associates the Sphinx with a greatand terrible riddle?Stillness and silenceCrouching in the massive horseshoe-shaped trench of bedrock out of which it wascarved, the statue looks old: a fierce and raddled towering monster, higher thana six-storey building and as long as a city block. Its flanks are lean, deeplyscalloped by erosion. Its paws, now covered with modern repair bricks, aresubstantially worn away. Its neck has been clumsily shorn up with a cementcollar intended to keep its grizzled head in place. Its face, too, is bruisedand battered, and yet it somehow seems serene and ageless, unpredictablyportraying different moods and expressions at different times and seasons,coming alive with patterns of light and shadow cast by scudding clouds at dawn.Wearing the elegant nemes head-dress of an Egyptian Pharaoh, it gazes patientlyinto the east, as though waiting for something—waiting and watching, lost in its‘stillness and silence’ (in the words of the Roman naturalist Pliny), andtargeting for ever the equinoctial rising point of the sun.How long has it stood here inspecting the horizon?Whose image does it portray?What is its function?In our search for answers to these questions we have found ourselves drawn intostrange and unexpected areas of research. Like souls on the way of the dead, wehave had to pass through the dark kingdom of the ancient Egyptian afterworld, tonavigate its narrow corridors, flooded passageways and hidden chambers, and toconfront the fiends and demons lurking there. Using computer simulations we havejourneyed back in time to stand beneath skies more than 12,000 years old, andwatched Orion cross the meridian at dawn as Leo rose resplendent in the east. Wehave immersed ourselves in archaic rebirth texts and myths and scriptures andfound amongst them the veiled remnants of a remarkable ‘astronomical language’that can, without too much difficulty, be read and understood today.Through clues expressed in this language we believe that we are able to identifywith certainty who and what the Sphinx really is. Moreover, as we shall see inParts III and IV, this identification appears to open a window on a forgottenepisode in human history when the waters of a great deluge were ebbing and mensought to transform themselves into gods. In our opinion the stakes are high.Indeed we think it possible that the Sphinx and the three great Pyramids mayoffer knowledge of the genesis of civilization itself. Our immediate aim inParts I and II, therefore, is to undertake a complete re-evaluation of all thesetitanic monuments, of the scholarship that has surrounded them during the pastcentury or so, and of their numerous neglected, geodetic and geological andastronomical qualities.Once these factors are taken into account a new Rosetta Stone begins to emerge,expressed in architecture and time, in allegories and symbols, and in specificastronomical directions and co-ordinates that tell the seeker where to look andwhat he might hope to find.Meanwhile the Great Sphinx waits patiently.Keeper of secrets.Guardian of mysteries."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2> > The Riddle of the Sphinx‘Sphinx, mythological creature with a lion’s body and human head ... Theearliest and most famous example in art is the colossal recumbent Sphinx atGiza, Egypt, dating from the reign of King Khafre (4th dynasty, c.2575-2465 BC).This is known to be a portrait statue of the King ...’Encyclopaedia BritannicaThere is a belief that the Great Sphinx of Giza was fashioned during that periodof Egyptian history classified as the ‘Old Kingdom’ on the orders of the FourthDynasty Pharaoh named Khafre whom the Greeks later knew as Chephren and whoreigned from 2520-2494 BC. This is the orthodox historical view and readers willfind it reported in all standard Egyptological texts, in all encyclopaedias, inarchaeological journals and in popular scientific literature. In these samesources it is also repeatedly stated as fact that the features of the Sphinxwere carved to represent Khafre himself—in other words, its face is his face.Thus, for example, Dr. I. E. S. Edwards, a world-renowned expert on themonuments of the Giza necropolis, tells us that although the face of the Sphinxhas been ‘severely mutilated’: ‘it still gives the impression of being aportrait of Khafre and not merely a formalised representation of the king.’[7][index_split_036.html#filepos769246]In a similar vein Ahmed Fakhry, professor of ancient history at CairoUniversity, informs us that: ‘as it was first conceived, the Sphinx symbolisedthe king, and its face was carved in Khafre’s likeness.’[8][index_split_036.html#filepos769409]The only problem—at any rate without access to a time machine—is that none ofus, not even distinguished Egyptologists, is really in a position to say whetheror not the Sphinx is a portrait or likeness of Khafre. Since the Pharaoh’s bodyhas never been found we have nothing to go on except surviving statues (whichmight or might not have closely resembled the king himself). The best known ofthese statues, an almost unsurpassable masterpiece of the sculptor’s art carvedout of a single piece of black diorite, now reposes in one of the ground-floorrooms of the Cairo Museum. It is to this beautiful and majestic representationthat the scholars make reference when they tell us—with such confidence—that theSphinx was fashioned in Khafre’s likeness.This confidence was particularly apparent in an article in the prestigiousNational Geographic magazine which appeared in the US in April 1991, and asimilar one that appeared in Britain in the Cambridge Archaeological Journal inApril 1992.[9] [index_split_036.html#filepos769574] The articles were written byProfessor Mark Lehner, of Chicago University’s Oriental Institute, who used‘photogrammetric data and computer graphics’ to ‘prove’ that the face of thegreat Sphinx was that of Khafre:Zahi Hawass, Director General of the Giza Pyramids, invited me to join hisexcavation [around the Sphinx] in 1978. During the next four years I led aproject to map the Sphinx in detail for the first time. We produced front andside views with photogrammetry, a technique using stereoscopic photography ...Computers have taken the records further. Maps were digitized to make a 3-Dwireframe model; some 2.6 million surface points were plotted to put ‘skin’ onthe skeleton view. We have constructed images of the Sphinx as it may havelooked thousands of years ago. To create the face, I tried matching views ofother sphinxes and pharaohs to our model. With the face of Khafre, the Sphinxcame alive ...[10] [index_split_036.html#filepos769879]It all sounds technically very impressive and persuasive. After all, who intheir right mind is going to argue with ‘2.6 million surface points’ based on‘stereoscopic photography’ and ‘photogrammetry’?Behind the technical jargon, however, the truth is rather less awe-inspiring. Aclose reading shows that all that Lehner did in order to ‘reconstruct’ the faceof the Sphinx was to prepare a computerized three-dimensional wireframe skeletonon which he then superimposed the face of Khafre. This is admitted in theNational Geographic article, which reproduces a photograph of the diorite statueof Khafre above the following caption: ‘The author [Lehner] used this face forthe computer reconstruction of the Sphinx.’[11][index_split_036.html#filepos770007]So what Mark Lehner really did was to remodel the face of the Sphinx on acomputer according to his own preferences—in much the same way that some ancientEgyptians had probably done several times before him on the face of the statueitself. The present features of the Sphinx, in other words, are no more likelyto be those of Khafre than they are to be those of a number of otherPharaohs—Thutmosis IV, for example, or Amenhotep, or Ramesses II (who is lastknown, as Lehner admits, to have ‘extensively reworked’ the monument at around1279 BC).[12] [index_split_036.html#filepos770092] The simple, honest truth isthat during the thousands of years of the Sphinx’s existence, often with onlyits head protruding above the sand, almost anyone could have worked on its faceat almost any time. Moreover, Lehner’s own photogrammetric study has thrown upat least one piece of evidence which is highly suggestive of major recarving:the Sphinx’s head, he writes, is ‘too small’ in proportion to the body. He tellsus that this is because it is an early prototype of the later very popular (andalways proportionate) sphinx form, and speculates that ‘the Fourth DynastyEgyptians may not [yet] have worked out the canon of proportions between theroyal head with the nemes headdress on the lion body’.[13][index_split_036.html#filepos770177] He does not consider the equally valid andmore intriguing possibility that the head was once much larger—and perhaps evenleonine, and that it was reduced in size by recarving.Probably relevant in this regard is an additional observation that Lehner hasmade: ‘a subtle discrepancy’ exists ‘between the axis of the head [of theSphinx] and that of the facial features’[14][index_split_036.html#filepos770322]—the head being orientated perfectly to dueeast, and the features swivelled somewhat to the north of east.Once again this is an error that is consistent with the recarving of a mucholder and heavily eroded statue. And it is consistent, too, as we shall seelater in this chapter, with new geological evidence concerning the Sphinx’santiquity. Setting these matters aside for the moment, however, it seems clearthat the mere fact that Mark Lehner is able to graft an image of Khafre onto thebattered visage of the Sphinx by means of the ‘ARL (Advanced Research Logic)Computer and the AutoCAD (release 10) graphics application’,[15][index_split_036.html#filepos770414] proves nothing more than that with goodcomputer graphics you can make anyone’s face look like anyone else’s face. ‘Thesame computer technique,’ in the words of one outspoken critic, ‘could be usedto “prove” the Sphinx was really Elvis Presley ...’[16][index_split_036.html#filepos770507]It was partly in an attempt to resolve this impasse that a group of independentresearchers took the unusual step of bringing a detective to Egypt in 1993. Thedetective in question was Lieutenant Frank Domingo, a senior forensic artistwith the New York Police Department, who has been preparing ‘identikit’portraits of suspects for more than twenty years. As a man who knows and workswith faces every day of his professional life, he was commissioned to make adetailed study of the points of similarity and difference between the Sphinx andthe Khafre statue. Months later, after returning to his lab in New York where heundertook careful comparisons of hundreds of photographs of the two works,Domingo reported:After reviewing my various drawings, schematics and measurements, my finalconclusion concurs with my initial reaction, i.e. that the two works representtwo separate individuals. The proportions in the frontal view, and especiallythe angles and facial protrusion in the lateral views convinced me that theSphinx is not Khafre ...’[17] [index_split_036.html#filepos770707]So on the one hand we have a top forsenic expert, Frank Domingo, telling us thatthe Sphinx’s face does not represent Khafre’s face. And on the other we haveMark Lehner, the Egyptologist computer buff, saying that only with Khafre’s facedoes the Sphinx ‘come alive’.Undatable, anonymousWhy is there room for such widely varying opinions concerning the world’s bestknown and most intensively studied ancient monument?In 1992, in two different forums, Mark Lehner made somewhat contradictorystatements which hint at the answer to this question:1. At the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancementof Science he said: ‘There is no direct way to date the Sphinx itself becausethe Sphinx is carved right out of natural rock.’[18][index_split_036.html#filepos770801]2. In the Cambridge Archaeological Journal he wrote: ‘Although we arecertain that the Sphinx dates to the Fourth Dynasty, we are confronted by acomplete absence of Old Kingdom texts which mention it.’[19][index_split_036.html#filepos770996]To deal with the first point first, it is a simple matter of fact that noobjective test presently exists for the accurate dating of rock-hewnmonuments.[20] [index_split_036.html#filepos771132] Many people are under theerroneous impression that the radio-carbon technique could be used, but this isnot so: it is only applicable to organic materials (in which it measures thequantity of the isotope Carbon-14 that has decayed since the death of theorganism in question). Since the Sphinx is made of carved rock it cannot bedated by this method.This brings us to the second point. Stone monuments can be dated with reasonableaccuracy if there are contemporary texts which refer to their construction.Ideally, in the case of the Sphinx, what one would require would be aninscription carved during the Fourth Dynasty and directly attributing themonument to Khafre. As Mark Lehner admits, however, no contemporary textreferring to the Sphinx has ever been found.In all honesty, therefore, what confronts us at Giza is an entirely anonymousmonument, carved out of undatable rock, about which, as the forthrightEgyptologist Selim Hassan wrote in 1949, ‘no definite facts are known’.[21][index_split_036.html#filepos771391]One syllableWhy, therefore, do Mark Lehner and other influential modern scholars continue tolink the Sphinx to Khafre and to insist that ‘The Old Kingdom Fourth Dynastydate for [its] origin ... is no longer an issue’[22][index_split_036.html#filepos771514]?One reason is a single syllable carved on the granite stela which stands betweenthe monument’s front paws and which has been taken as proof that Khafre builtthe Sphinx. The stela, which is not contemporary with the Sphinx itself,commemorates heroic efforts by the Pharaoh Thutmosis IV (1401-1391 BC) to clearthe Sphinx completely of encroaching sand and describes the lion-bodied statueas the embodiment of ‘a great magical power that existed in this place from thebeginning of all time’.[23] [index_split_036.html#filepos771649] The inscriptionalso contains, in line 13, the first syllable—Khaf—of the name Khafre. Thepresence of that syllable, in the words of Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, is: ‘veryimportant for it proves that ... the priests of Heliopolis who advised Thutmosisto undertake the work of clearing away the sand from the Sphinx believed that itwas fashioned by Khafre ...’[24] [index_split_036.html#filepos771836]But does the syllable Khaf really prove so much?When the stela was excavated by the Genoese adventurer Gian Battista Caviglia in1817, line 13—which has now entirely flaked away—was already badly damaged. Weknow of its existence because, not long after the excavation, the Britishphilologist Thomas Young, a leading expert in the decipherment of ancientEgyptian hieroglyphs, was able to make a facsimile of the inscription. For line13 his translation reads as follows: ‘... which we bring for him: oxen ... andall young vegetables; and we shall give praise to Wenofer ... Khaf ... thestatue made for Atum-Hor-em-Akhet. ...’[25] [index_split_036.html#filepos771932]On the assumption that Khaf was Khafre’s name, Young added the syllable Rebetween square brackets to show that a lacuna had been filled in.[26][index_split_036.html#filepos772136] In 1905, however, when the AmericanEgyptologist James Henry Breasted studied Young’s facsimile he concluded that amistake had been made: ‘This mention of King Khafre has been understood toindicate that the Sphinx was the work of this king—a conclusion which does notfollow; [the facsimile of] Young has no trace of a cartouche ...’[27][index_split_036.html#filepos772221]In all the inscriptions of ancient Egypt, from the beginning to the end ofPharaonic civilization, the names of kings were always inscribed insideoval-shaped signs or enclosures known as ‘cartouches’. It is therefore extremelydifficult to understand how on the granite stela between the paws of the Sphinxthe name of as powerful a king as Khafre—or indeed of any other king—could havebeen written without its pre-required cartouche.Besides, even if the syllable Khaf was intended to refer to Khafre, its presencedoes not necessarily imply that he built the Sphinx. It is equally possible thathe was being commemorated for some other service. For example, like manyPharaohs after him (Ramesses II, Thutmosis IV, Ahmoses I, etc., etc.[28][index_split_036.html#filepos772306])—and perhaps like many before him too—is itnot possible that Khafre was a restorer of the Sphinx?As it happens, this perfectly logical deduction and others like it were favouredby a number of the leading scholars who pioneered the discipline of Egyptologyat around the end of the nineteenth century. Gaston Maspero, for example,Director of the Department of Antiquities at the Cairo Museum, an acclaimedphilologist of his time, wrote in 1900:The stela of the Sphinx bears, on line 13, the [name] of Khafre in the middle ofa gap ... There, I believe, is an indication of [a renovation and clearance] ofthe Sphinx carried out under this prince, and consequently the more or lesscertain proof that the Sphinx was already covered with sand during the time ofhis predecessors ...[29] [index_split_036.html#filepos772434]This view is supported by the text of another roughly contemporary stela, theso-called ‘Inventory Stela’—also found at Giza but arbitrarily assumed by themajority of modern Egyptologists to be a work of fiction—which states that Khufusaw the Sphinx. Since Khufu, the supposed builder of the Great Pyramid, wasKhafre’s predecessor, the obvious implication is that Khafre could not havebuilt the Sphinx.[30] [index_split_036.html#filepos772576] Encouraged by thistestimony, Maspero at one point went so far as to propose that the Sphinx couldhave existed since the times of the ‘Followers of Horus’, a lineage ofpre-dynastic, semi-divine beings whose members were believed by the ancientEgyptians to have ruled for thousands of years before the ‘historical’Pharaohs.[31] [index_split_036.html#filepos772729] Later in his career, however,the French Egyptologist modified his opinion to conform with the generalconsensus and stated that the Sphinx ‘probably represents Khafre himself’.[32][index_split_036.html#filepos772885]That Maspero should have felt compelled to recant his heretical views on theSphinx tells us more about the power of peer pressure within Egyptology than itdoes about the quality of evidence concerning the antiquity and attribution ofthe monument itself. Indeed, the evidence underpinning the prevailing consensusis extremely slim, resting not so much on ‘facts’ as on the interpretation thatcertain authorities have chosen at one time or another to give to particular andusually highly ambiguous data—in this case the solitary syllable of Khafre’sname on the Thutmosis stela.Very few senior members of the profession have been as honest about such mattersas Selim Hassan. In his classic 1949 study of the Sphinx, from which we havealready quoted, he issued this pertinent warning:Excepting for the mutilated line on the granite stela of Thothmosis IV, whichproves nothing, there is not a single ancient inscription which connects theSphinx with Khafre. So sound as it may appear, we must treat this evidence ascircumstantial until such a time as a lucky turn of the spade will reveal to theworld definite reference to the erection of this statue ...[33][index_split_036.html#filepos773028]ContextSince Hassan wrote there has been no such ‘lucky turn of the spade’.Nevertheless the conventional wisdom that the Sphinx was built by Khafre, circa2500 BC, remains so strong and so all-pervasive that one assumes there must besomething else behind it other than the disputed resemblance to the statue ofKhafre in the Cairo Museum and the contradictory opinions of scholars concerninga half-ruined stela.According to Mark Lehner, there is indeed something else—a kind of magic bulletwhich he clearly regards as powerful enough to kill any niggling doubts andquestions. Today the Director of the Koch-Ludwig Giza Plateau Project, andformer Director of the now completed Giza Mapping Project, Lehner is recognizedas a world expert on the Sphinx. Whenever he fires his magic bullet at theoccasional ‘heretics’ who have suggested that the monument might be a lot olderthan 2500 BC, therefore, he does so from a position of great influence andauthority.The name of his magic bullet is context and, at the 1992 annual meeting of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, where he was selected asthe official spokesman of Egyptology to put the orthodox point of view in adebate on the true age of the Sphinx, he made extensive use of this ‘bullet’:The Sphinx does not sit out alone in the desert totally up for grabs as to ‘howold is the Sphinx?’. The Sphinx is surrounded by a vast architectural contextwhich includes the Pyramid of Khufu [better known as the Great Pyramid], thePyramid of Khafre [‘the second Pyramid’] and the Pyramid of Menkaure,[34][index_split_036.html#filepos773151] pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty. Eachpyramid has a long causeway running from a Mortuary Temple on its eastern side,down to the level of the Nile flood-plain, where a Valley Temple served as anentrance to the pyramid complex ...Officials and relatives of the pharaohs built their tombs in cemeteries east andwest of the Khufu Pyramid, and southeast of the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaurerespectively. Digging at Giza for nearly two centuries, archaeologists haveretrieved an abundance of material [dating to the Fourth Dynasty]. Hundreds oftombs have yielded the mortal remains and artifacts of people who composed thestate administration of the Pyramid Age ... We are discovering evidence of theworking class and everyday life of the society that built the Sphinx andpyramids ... We have evidence of the ruins of an ancient city spread out alongthe valley for the entire length of the Giza Plateau. All this is part of thearchaeological context of the Sphinx ...[35][index_split_036.html#filepos773335]Lehner goes on to say that there are several specific reasons why this contextpersuades him that ‘the Sphinx belongs to Khafre’s Pyramid complex’:The south side of the Sphinx ditch forms the northern edge of the Khafrecauseway as it runs past the Sphinx and enters Khafre’s Valley Temple. Adrainage channel runs along the northern side of the causeway and opens into theupper south-west corner of the Sphinx ditch, suggesting the ancient quarrymenformed the ditch after the Khafre causeway was built. Otherwise they would nothave had the drain empty into the ditch. Khafre’s Valley Temple sits on the sameterrace as the Sphinx Temple. The fronts and backs of the Temples are nearlyaligned, and the walls of both are built in the same style ...[36][index_split_036.html#filepos773478]The evidence for the two Temples, the causeway and the second Pyramid all beingpart of one architectural unit with the Sphinx is indeed compelling. But usingthis evidence to support the conclusion that Khafre built the Sphinx is ratherless so. What it ignores is the possibility that the entire ‘unit’ could havebeen built long before Khafre’s time by as yet unidentified predecessors andthen reused—perhaps even extensively restored—during the Fourth Dynasty.It is this possibility—not precluded by any inscriptions and not ruled out byany objective dating techniques—that has made the Sphinx the subject of anincreasingly virulent controversy during the 1990s ...Water erosionThe origins of this controversy go back to the late 1970s when John AnthonyWest, an independent American researcher, was studying the obscure and difficultwritings of the brilliant French mathematician and symbolist R. A. Schwaller deLubicz. Schwaller is best known for his works on the Luxor Temple, but in hismore general text, Sacred Science (first published in 1961), he commented on thearchaeological implications of certain climatic conditions and floods that lastafflicted Egypt more than 12,000 years ago:A great civilization must have preceded the vast movements of water that passedover Egypt, which leads us to assume that the Sphinx already existed, sculpturedin the rock of the west cliff at Giza that Sphinx whose leonine body, except forthe head shows indisputable signs of aquatic erosion.[37][index_split_036.html#filepos773571]Schwaller’s simple observation, which nobody appeared to have taken any noticeof before, obviously challenged the Egyptological consensus attributing theSphinx to Khafre and to the epoch of 2500 BC. What West immediately realized onreading this passage, however, was that, through geology, Schwaller had alsooffered a way ‘virtually to prove the existence of another, and perhaps greatercivilization antedating dynastic Egypt—and all other known civilizations—bymillennia’:[38] [index_split_036.html#filepos773760]If the single fact of the water erosion of the Sphinx could be confirmed, itwould in itself overthrow all accepted chronologies of the history ofcivilization; it would force a drastic re-evaluation of the assumptions of‘progress’—the assumption upon which the whole of modern education is based. Itwould be difficult to find a single, simple question with graver implications...[39] [index_split_036.html#filepos773893]Not floodwatersWest is right about the implications. If the weathering patterns on the Sphinxcan be proved to have been caused by water—and not by wind or sand asEgyptologists maintain—then there is indeed a very serious problem withestablished chronologies. In order to understand why, we need only remindourselves that Egypt’s climate has not always been as bone dry as it is todayand that the erosion patterns to which West and Schwaller are drawing ourattention are unique to the ‘architectural unit’ that Lehner and others defineas the ‘context’ of the Sphinx. From their common weathering features—which arenot shared by the other monuments of the Giza necropolis—it is obvious that thestructures making up this unit were all built in the same epoch.But when was that epoch?West’s initial opinion was that:There can be no objection in principle to the water-erosion of the Sphinx, sinceit is agreed that in the past, Egypt suffered radical climatic changes andperiodic inundations—by the sea and (in the not so remote past) by tremendousNile floods. The latter are thought to correspond to the melting of the ice fromthe last Ice Age. Current thinking puts this date at around 15,000 BC, butperiodic great Nile floods are believed to have taken place subsequent to thisdate. The last of these floods is dated around 10,000 BC. It follows, therefore,that if the great Sphinx has been eroded by water, it must have been constructedprior to the flood or floods responsible for the erosion ...[40][index_split_036.html#filepos773987]The logic is indeed sound ‘in principle’. In practice, however, as West waslater to admit, ‘flood or floods’ could not have been responsible for thepeculiar kind of erosion seen on the Sphinx:The problem is that the Sphinx is deeply weathered up to its neck. Thisnecessitates 60-foot floods (at a minimum) over the whole of the Nile Valley. Itwas difficult to imagine floods of this magnitude. Worse, if the theory wascorrect, the inner limestone core-blocks of the so-called Mortuary Temple at theend of the causeway leading from the Sphinx had also been weathered by water,and this meant floods reaching to the base of the Pyramids—another hundred feetor so of flood waters ...[41] [index_split_036.html#filepos774081]Floodwaters, then, could not have eroded the Sphinx. So what had?RainfallIn 1989 John West approached Professor Robert Schoch of Boston University. Ahighly respected geologist, stratigrapher and paleontologist, Schoch’sspeciality is the weathering of soft rocks very much like the limestone of theGiza plateau. Clearly, says West, he was a man who ‘had exactly the kind ofexpertise needed to confirm or rebut the theory once and for all’.[42][index_split_036.html#filepos774175]Schoch was at first sceptical of the idea of a much older Sphinx but changed hismind after making an initial visit to the site in 1990. Although he was unableto gain access to the Sphinx enclosure he could see enough from the touristviewing platform to confirm that the monument did indeed appear to have beenweathered by water. It was also obvious to him that the agency of thisweathering had not been floods but ‘precipitation’.‘In other words’, West explains, ‘rainwater was responsible for weathering theSphinx, not floods ... Precipitation-induced weathering took care of the problemin a single stroke. The sources I was using for reference talked about thesefloods in conjunction with long periods of rains, but it hadn’t occurred to me,as a non-geologist, that the rains, rather than the periodic floods, were theactual weathering agent ...’[43] [index_split_036.html#filepos774269]As we have noted, Schoch got no closer to the Sphinx on his 1990 visit than thetourist viewing platform. At this stage, therefore, his endorsement of West’stheory could only be provisional.Why had the geologist from Boston not been allowed inside the Sphinx enclosure?The reason was that since 1978 only a handful of Egyptologists had been grantedthat privilege, with all public access closed off by the Egyptian authoritiesand a high fence built around the site.With the support of the Dean of Boston University, Schoch now submitted a formalproposal to the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, requesting permission tocarry out a proper geological study of the erosion of the Sphinx.A rude interruptionIt took a long time, but because of his eminent institutional backing, Schoch’sproposal was eventually approved by the EAO, creating a brilliant opportunity toget to the bottom of the Sphinx controversy once and for all. John Westimmediately set about putting together a broadly based scientific team,including a professional geophysicist, Dr. Thomas L. Dobecki, from the highlyrespected Houston consulting firm of McBride-Ratcliff & Associates.[44][index_split_036.html#filepos774363] There were also to be others who joined‘unofficially’: an architect and photographer; two further geologists; anoceanographer and a personal friend of John West’s, film-producer BorisSaid.[45] [index_split_036.html#filepos774457] Through Said, West had arrangedto ‘record the ongoing work in a video documentary which would have wide publicappeal’:[46] [index_split_036.html#filepos774542]Since we could expect nothing but opposition from academic Egyptologists andarchaeologists a way had to be found to get the theory to the public, if andwhen Schoch decided the evidence warranted full geological support. Otherwise itwould simply be buried, possibly for good ...[47][index_split_036.html#filepos774627]As a way of getting the theory of an ancient rainfall-eroded Sphinx to thepublic, West’s film could hardly have been more successful. When it was firstscreened on NBC television in the United States in the autumn of 1993 it waswatched by 33 million people.But that is another story. Back in the Sphinx enclosure the first interestingresult came from Dobecki, who had conducted seismographic tests around theSphinx. The sophisticated equipment that he had brought with him picked upnumerous indications of ‘anomalies and cavities in the bedrock between the pawsand along the sides of the Sphinx’.[48] [index_split_036.html#filepos774724] Oneof these cavities he described as:a fairly large feature; it’s about nine metres by twelve metres in dimension,and buried less than five metres in depth. Now the regular shape ofthis—rectangular—is inconsistent with naturally occurring cavities ... Sothere’s some suggestion that this could be man-made.[49][index_split_036.html#filepos774818]With legal access to the enclosure, West recalls, Schoch, too:was swiftly dropping conditionals ... The deeply weathered Sphinx and its ditchwall, and the relatively unweathered or clearly wind-weathered Old Kingdom tombsto the south (dating from around Khafre’s period) were cut from the same memberof rock. In Schoch’s view it was therefore geologically impossible to ascribethese structures to the same time period. Our scientists were agreed. Onlywater, specifically precipitation, could produce the weathering we wereobserving ...[50] [index_split_036.html#filepos774975]It was at this crucial moment, while the members of the team were puttingtogether the first independent geological profile of the Sphinx, that Dr. ZahiHawass; the Egyptian Antiquities Organization’s Director-General of the GizaPyramids, fell upon them, suddenly and unexpectedly, like the proverbial ton ofbricks.The team had obtained their permission from Dr. Ibrahim Bakr, then the Presidentof the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. What they had not known, however, wasthat relations between Bakr and Hawass were frosty. Neither had they reckonedwith Hawass’s energy and ego. Fuming that he had been bypassed by his superior,he accused the Americans of tampering with the monuments:I have found out that their work is carried out by installing endoscopes in theSphinx’s body and shooting films for all phases of the work in a propaganda ...but not in a scientific manner. I therefore suspended the work of thisunscientific mission and made a report which was presented to the permanentcommission who rejected the mission’s work in future ...[51][index_split_036.html#filepos775107]This was putting it mildly. Far from ‘suspending’ their work, Hawass hadvirtually thrown the American team off the site. His intervention had come toolate, however, to prevent them from gathering the essential geological data thatthey needed.When did it rain?Back in Boston, Schoch got down to work at his laboratory. The results wereconclusive and a few months later he was ready to stick his neck out. Indeed toJohn West’s delight he was now prepared fully to endorse the notion of arain-eroded Sphinx—with all its immense historical implications.Schoch’s case, in brief—which has the full support ofpalaeo-climatologists—rests on the fact that heavy rainfall of the kind requiredto cause the characteristic erosion patterns on the Sphinx had stopped fallingon Egypt thousands of years before the epoch of 2500 BC in which Egyptologistssay that the Sphinx was built. The geological evidence therefore suggests that avery conservative estimate of the true construction date of the Sphinx would besomewhere between ‘7000 to 5000 BC minimum’.[52][index_split_036.html#filepos775237]In 7000 to 5000 BC—according to Egyptologists—the Nile valley was populated onlyby primitive neolithic hunter-gatherers whose ‘toolkits’ were limited tosharpened flintstones and pieces of stick. If Schoch is right, therefore, thenit follows that the Sphinx and its neighbouring temples (which are built out ofhundreds of 200-ton limestone blocks) must be the work of an as yet unidentifiedadvanced civilization of antiquity.The Egyptological reaction?‘That’s ridiculous’, scoffed Peter Lecovara, assistant curator of the EgyptianDepartment in Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. ‘Thousands of scholars working forhundreds of years have studied this problem and the chronology is pretty muchworked out. There are no big surprises in store for us ...’[53][index_split_036.html#filepos775369]Other ‘experts’ were equally dismissive. According to Carol Redmont, forexample, an archaeologist at the University of California’s Berkeley campus:‘There is no way this could be true. The people of that region would not havehad the technology, the governing institutions or even the will to build such astructure thousands of years before Khafre’s reign.’[54][index_split_036.html#filepos775486]And the redoubtable Zahi Hawass, who had tried to nip the geological research inthe bud in the first place, had this to say about the Schoch-West team and theirunorthodox conclusions concerning the antiquity of the Sphinx:American hallucinations! West is an amateur. There is absolutely no scientificbase for any of this. We have older monuments in the same area. They definitelyweren’t built by men from space or Atlantis. It’s nonsense and we won’t allowour monuments to be exploited for personal enrichment. The Sphinx is the soul ofEgypt’.[55] [index_split_036.html#filepos775608]John West was not in the least bit surprised by the rhetoric. In his long andlonely quest to mount a proper investigation into the age of the anonymousSphinx many such brickbats had been thrown at him before. This time, withSchoch’s heavyweight support—and the massive exposure of the whole matter on NBCtelevision—he felt vindicated at last. Furthermore it was clear that theEgyptologists were rattled by the intrusion of an empirical science like geologyinto their normally cosy and exclusive academic territory.West, however, wanted to take the matter a good deal further than Schoch wasprepared to go and felt that the geologist had been too conservative and lenientin his ‘minimum’ estimate of 7000 to 5000 BC for the age of the Sphinx: ‘HereSchoch and I disagree, or rather interpret the same data somewhat differently.Schoch very deliberately takes the most conservative view allowed by the data... However I remain convinced that the Sphinx must predate the break-up of thelast Ice Age ...’[56] [index_split_036.html#filepos775740]In practice this means any time before 15,000 BC—a hunch that West says is basedon the complete lack of evidence of a high culture in Egypt in 7000 to 5000 BC.‘If the Sphinx was as recent as 7000-5000 BC,’ he argues, ‘I think we probablywould have other Egyptian evidence of the civilization that carved it.’[57][index_split_036.html#filepos775825] Since there is no such evidence, Westreasons that the civilization responsible for the Sphinx and its neighbouringtemples must have disappeared long before 7000-5000 BC: ‘The missing otherevidence is, perhaps, buried deeper than anyone has looked and/or in places noone has yet explored—along the banks of the ancient Nile perhaps, which is milesfrom the present Nile, or even at the bottom of the Mediterranean, which was dryduring the last Ice Age ...’[58] [index_split_036.html#filepos775910]Despite their ‘friendly disagreement’ as to whether the erosion of the Sphinxindicated a date of 7000 to 5000 BC, or a much more remote period, Schoch andWest decided to present an abstract of their research at Giza to the GeologicalSociety of America. They were encouraged by the response. Several hundredgeologists agreed with the logic of their contentions and dozens offeredpractical help and advice to further the investigation.[59][index_split_036.html#filepos775995]Even more refreshing was the reaction from the international media. After theGSA meeting articles appeared in dozens of newspapers, and the issue of theSphinx’s age was widely covered by television and radio. ‘We were over thefifty-yard line and heading downfield,’ recalls West.[60][index_split_036.html#filepos776089]As for the matter of his difference of opinion with Schoch about the dating ofthe monument, he honestly concedes that ‘only further research will resolve thequestion’.[61] [index_split_036.html#filepos776183]Jury still outSince 1993 the Egyptian government, on the advice of Western Egyptologists, hasnot permitted any further geological research or seismic investigations to beundertaken around the Sphinx. This is surprising in view of the momentousimplications of Schoch’s findings and all the more surprising because hisoriginal evidence has not yet been convincingly challenged in any forum. On thecontrary, as the years have gone by, the Boston geologist has withstood therigours of scientific peer review, several times successfully defending hiscontention that the distinctive weathering visible on the Sphinx, and on thewalls of its enclosure—a combination of deep vertical fissures and rolling,undulating, horizontal coves—is ‘a classic, textbook example of what happens toa limestone structure when you have rain beating down on it for thousands ofyears ...[62] [index_split_036.html#filepos776277] When set in the context ofour knowledge of ancient climates at Giza, he adds, this represents abundantevidence ‘that the Great Sphinx predates its traditional attribution of circa2500 BC ... I’m just following the science where it leads me, and it leads me toconclude that the Sphinx was built much earlier than previously thought.’[63][index_split_036.html#filepos776395]Of course it cannot be said that Robert Schoch has proved that the monumentdates back to the epoch of 7000 to 5000 BC. Nor has John West proved the evenearlier date that he favours. But then again neither has orthodox Egyptologyproved that the Sphinx belongs to Khafre and to the epoch of 2500 BC.In other words, by any rational and reasonable criteria, the jury is still outon the true attribution and antiquity of this extraordinary monument.The riddle of the Sphinx is still unsolved. And as we see in the next chapter,it is a riddle that encompasses the entire Giza necropolis."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3> > Mystery Piled upon Mystery‘It is said that the stone [used in the construction of the Pyramids of Giza]was conveyed over a great distance ... and that the construction was effected bymeans of mounds ... The most remarkable thing is that, though the constructionswere on such a great scale and the country round about them consists of nothingbut sand, not a trace remains either of any mound or of the dressing of thestones, so that they do not have the appearance of being the slow handiwork ofmen but look like a sudden creation, as though they had been made by some godand set down bodily in the surrounding sand.’Diodorus Siculus, Book I, first century BCThe Giza necropolis, site of the Great Sphinx and the three great Pyramids ofEgypt, is, by any standards, an extraordinary architectural and archaeologicalpuzzle. This is not only because of the many remarkable physical and engineeringcharacteristics of the principal Pyramids and temples, but also because all ofthese monuments are essentially uninscribed and anonymous. Like the Sphinx,therefore, they are difficult to date by objective means. Like the Sphinx, too,their attribution to specific Pharaohs by Egyptologists is necessarily basedupon a somewhat arbitrary interpretation of contextual clues.The three great Pyramids, for example, are conventionally assigned as the tombsof Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure—three Pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty. Yet noPharaoh’s body has ever been found in any of these monuments and while there aresome so-called ‘quarry marks’—crudely daubed graffiti—in cavities above the roofof the ‘King’s Chamber’ in the Great Pyramid, these writings, as we shall see inPart II, are not particularly helpful in confirming the orthodox identificationwith Khufu. There are no other texts of any kind in the Great Pyramid, or in thePyramids attributed to Khafre and Menkaure. The three small ‘satellite’ Pyramidslined up along the eastern face of the Great Pyramid, and the three othersatellite Pyramids lying near the south-western edge of the site, are similarlybereft of inscriptions. Some Fourth Dynasty artefacts were found inside thesesix ‘satellite’ structures but there is no guarantee that these artefacts arecontemporary with the monuments.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image002.jpg]2. Overhead view of the principal monuments of the Giza necropolis.The same problem applies to the statues of Khafre and Menkaure that were foundin the latter’s ‘Mortuary’ Temple and the former’s ‘Valley’ Temple. Thesestatues are the only evidence supporting the attribution of these otherwiseanonymous and uninscribed edifices to the two Pharaohs in question. In alllogic, however, they only suggest that attribution. They certainly do notconfirm it. Khafre and Menkaure, in other words, might have built the temples.But it is also possible that they took over preexisting structures which theyhad inherited from an earlier time, and that they adapted, renovated andfurnished these structures with their own statues in order to suit their ownpurposes. After all, we do not attribute the building of London’s TrafalgarSquare to Nelson just because his statue stands there. By the same tokenEgyptologists could be going too far when they attribute the building of theValley Temple to Khafre on the basis of his statue found there.Indeed, this is an observation that is true for the Giza necropolis as a whole.The undoubted connection that it has with the Fourth Dynasty is not in dispute,but the precise nature of this connection remains unproven. To be sure, thereare huge quantities of unmistakable and heavily inscribed Fourth Dynasty mastabatombs lying east and west of the Great Pyramid and west of the Sphinx, but thecontention that the Pyramids themselves are ‘tombs and tombs only’ is guesswork.It could be the case, as has happened elsewhere in the world, that an ancientand sacred site designed and built for one purpose was subsequently taken overand reused for another rather different purpose. We might imagine, for example,that the Pyramids and the other principal monuments surrounding them wereoriginally intended to fulfil purely ritual, ceremonial and religious functionsand that the practice of burying the dead there—principally Fourth Dynastyqueens and nobles judging by the identifiable remains that have survived—was alater adaptation effected by people who were unconnected to the genesis of thesite but who sought to be interred in a place that was imbued with ancientprestige and sanctity. A Western analogy is the practice of burying the remainsof particularly favoured individuals under the flagstones of medievalcathedrals—a practice that continues to this day, but that does not lead us toconclude that these cathedrals are tombs or even that they were built primarilyfor the purposes of burial.Impossible engineeringApproaching Giza from the east, through the modern Arab village ofNazlet-el-Sammam, one comes first to the Great Sphinx—which rears its grizzledhead above an ugly bus-park and a crowd of tourist shops and cafés. Fortunatelythe ground has been cleared for a distance of about two hundred metres in frontof the monument, giving an open view of the enormous and unusual architecturalcomplex that has surrounded it since time immemorial.This complex consists of the so-called ‘Sphinx Temple’ and the ‘Valley Temple ofKhafre’, the former lying immediately to the east of the Sphinx, and directlyoverlooked by it, the latter lying a little to the south of the Sphinx Temple,separated from it by a narrow corridor but in direct alignment—a bit like twochunky, detached houses standing side by side.The layout of these monuments, and the relationship that both of them have tothe Sphinx and its enclosure, are best appreciated from the plans andphotographs reproduced herewith. The Valley Temple is the larger of the two,being almost square and measuring approximately 130 feet along each side; theSphinx Temple is more pronouncedly rhomboidal with side lengths of about 100feet.Originally around 40 feet high, both monuments are built out of massivelimestone core-blocks and both were at one time fitted with inner and outercasings of granite. These casings and much of the core masonry have been removedfrom the Sphinx Temple, leaving it in a very dilapidated state. By contrast theValley Temple is still largely intact. Both monuments are roofless, lackingtheir original ceiling beams. In the case of the Valley Temple, however, sixteenoriginal interior columns and architraves remain in place in the T-shapedcentral hall, creating graceful patterns of light and shadow.The unifying features of these ancient and anonymous structures are the stark,undecorated austerity of the building style, and the use throughout of ponderousmegaliths—many of which are estimated to weigh in the range of 200 tonsapiece.[64] [index_split_036.html#filepos776531] There are no small blocks hereat all: every single piece of stone is enormous—the least of them weighing morethan 50 tons—and it is difficult to understand how such monsters could have beenlifted and manoeuvred into place by the ancient Egyptians. Indeed, even today,contractors using the latest construction technology would face formidablechallenges if they were commissioned to produce exact replicas of the SphinxTemple and the Valley Temple.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image003.jpg]3. The Great Sphinx and the architectural complex that surrounds it: SphinxTemple, Valley Temple, Causeway (foreshortened and not to scale) and MortuaryTemple.The problems are manifold but stem mainly from the extremely large size of theblocks—which can be envisaged in terms of their dimensions and weight as aseries of diesel locomotive engines stacked one on top of the other. Such loadssimply cannot be hoisted by the typical tower and hydraulic cranes that we arefamiliar with from building sites in our cities. These cranes, which are piecesof advanced technology, can generally ‘pick’ a maximum load of 20 tons at whatis called ‘minimum span’—i.e. at the closest distance to the tower along the‘boom’ or ‘arm’ of the crane. The longer the span the smaller the load and at‘maximum span’ the limit is around 5 tons.Loads exceeding 50 tons require special cranes. Furthermore, there are fewcranes in the world today that would be capable of picking 200-ton blocks ofquarried limestone. Such cranes would normally have to be of the ‘bridge’ or‘gantry’ type, often seen in factories and at major industrial ports where theyare used to move large pieces of equipment and machinery such as bulldozers,military tanks, or steel shipping containers. Built with structural steelmembers and powered with massive electric motors, the majority of these craneshave a load limit of under 100 tons. In short, a commission to put together atemple out of 200-ton blocks would be a most unusual and very taxing job, evenfor modern heavy-load and crane specialists.In the United States there are presently only two land-based cranes of the‘counterweight and boom’ type able to handle loads in the 200-ton range.Recently one was brought in to a Long Island construction site to lift a 200-tonboiler into a factory. The crane has a boom 220 feet long (at one end of whichis 160-ton concrete counterweight which keeps it from tipping over). A crew of20 men had to work for six weeks to prepare the ground before the boiler couldbe lifted.[65] [index_split_036.html#filepos777016]The biggest technical challenge of building a replica of the Valley Temple wouldbe the need to lift hundreds of such weights and to do so within the physicallimitations of the Giza site. In order to overcome that challenge the idealcrane would have to be of the gantry or bridge type, made mobile by beingmounted on steel tracks—which would have to be set up within, or around, theconfined area of the temple structure itself.Not surprisingly, when the crane engineer responsible for lifting the 200-tonboiler on Long Island was shown photographs and given technical detailsconcerning the blocks of the Valley Temple—and asked whether he thought that hecould hoist similar blocks into place with his crane—he replied:I’m looking at what you’re showing me here, and looking at the distancesinvolved. I don’t know if we would be able to pick the 200-ton blocks from thepositions that I see available to us ... In my business we pick heavy loads, andwe look to see how heavy loads were picked by other people before us. And seeinghow they moved these heavy blocks, 200-ton blocks, thousands and thousands ofyears ago, I have no idea how they did this job. It’s a mystery and it’llprobably always be a mystery to me, and maybe to everybody.[66][index_split_036.html#filepos777134]How, why, when?Mystery or not, the Valley Temple and the Sphinx Temple stand at Giza as mutetestimony to the fact that certain builders in antiquity did know how to pick200-ton loads, and did have the technical wherewithal to do the job.Furthermore, although it is reasonably certain that they did not do it withgantry or any other such cranes, we are in darkness as to how they did do it.Confronted by such questions Egyptologists tend to speak in vague and generalterms of ‘earth ramps’ and ‘unlimited manpower’.[67][index_split_036.html#filepos777234] Engineers, however are required to be morespecific and to address themselves to the issues of the precise kinds of rampsthat would have been required—up which such big blocks could have beendragged—and the precise numbers of men that would have been needed to drag them.No detailed technical studies have ever been undertaken at Giza concerning thelogistics of building the Sphinx and Valley Temples. The Pyramids, however—whichEgyptologists also believe were built with ramps—have been studied quite closelyby a number of highly qualified architects and engineers.[68][index_split_036.html#filepos777486] What these studies have indicated is thatthe maximum feasible gradient for a construction ramp up which heavy loads couldbe hauled by men on foot is 1 in 10.[69] [index_split_036.html#filepos777695] Inthe case of the Great Pyramid, which originally reached a height of 481 feet,this would have called for a ramp 4800 feet long and almost three times asmassive as the Pyramid itself.[70] [index_split_036.html#filepos777788]Of course, such a problem does not apply where the Sphinx Temple and the ValleyTemple are concerned because their original constructed height was much lowerthan that of the Pyramids and they therefore could have been approached byrelatively short 1-in-10 ramps. The fearsome mass and weight of the many 200-tonblocks found in these temples, however, rules out the use of any ramp made ofmaterials less stable than the limestone ashlars of the temples themselves.[71][index_split_036.html#filepos777885]Let us assume, then, that solid stone ramps were used and then later dismantledand cleared away. The question now becomes: how many men would be required tohaul hundreds of 200-ton blocks up such ramps? To get this problem intoperspective it is helpful to realize that a block of 200 tons represents a loadroughly equivalent to 300 family-sized automobiles (each with an average weightof three-quarters of a ton).Again, we do not have a technical study on the Sphinx and Valley Temples torefer to. Fortunately, however, a relevant study has been undertaken at theGreat Pyramid where the French master engineer Jean Leherou Kerisel, aconsultant for the building of the Cairo Metro, worked out the logistics ofhauling into place the 70-ton blocks that were used in the construction of theso-called King’s Chamber. According to his calculations the job could just abouthave been done—although with enormous difficulty—with teams of 600 men arrangedin ranks across a very wide ramp buttressed against one face of the Pyramid.[72][index_split_036.html#filepos777978] From this it follows that teams 1800 menstrong would have been required to haul the Valley Temple blocks. But could 1800men have been effectively harnessed to such dense and relatively compact loads(the maximum dimensions of each block are 30 feet by 10 feet by 12 feet)? Andmore to the point, since the temple walls do not exceed 130 feet along eachside, how likely is it that such large teams could have been organized to workefficiently—or at all—in the limited space available? Assuming a minimum ofthree feet of horizontal space per man, each rank of haulers could not havecontained more than fifty men. To make up the total of 1800 men needed to move a200-ton block, therefore, would have called for no less than thirty-six ranks ofmen pulling in unison, to be harnessed to each block.The potential complications that might have arisen are mind-boggling. Evenassuming they could all have been overcome, however, the next question thatpresents itself is perhaps the most intriguing of all.Why?Why bother?Why specify temples built out of unwieldy 200-ton blocks when it would have beenmuch easier, much more feasible and just as aesthetically pleasing, to usesmaller blocks of say two or three tons each?There are really only two answers. Either the people who designed these hulkingedifices had knowledge of some technique that made it easy for them to quarry,manipulate and position enormous pieces of stone, or their way of thinking wasutterly different from our own—in which case their motives and priorities areunlikely to be fathomable in terms of normal cross-cultural comparisons.We also need to ask when the work was done.As noted earlier, the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple are both anonymousmonuments. And although it is certain that use was made of the latter forKhafre’s funerary rituals, there is no proof that he built it. On the contrary,if Professor Robert Schoch’s geological evidence is correct, then it is quitecertain that Khafre did not build either of these structures. This is so becausethe Sphinx itself was made by hewing a deep horseshoe-shaped trench out of thebedrock of the Giza plateau, leaving a central core which was then carved intoshape, and because geologists have been able to prove that the limestonemegaliths used in both temples came from the trench and were thus quarried atthe same time as the Sphinx.[73] [index_split_036.html#filepos779636] Ittherefore follows, if the Sphinx is indeed thousands of years older thanEgyptologists think it is, that the temples must also be thousands of yearsolder.What we may be looking at here are the fingerprints of highly sophisticated andperhaps even technological people capable of awe-inspiring architectural andengineering feats at a time when no civilization of any kind is supposed to haveexisted anywhere on earth.Supportive of this possibility is the fact that the megaliths of the templesdemonstrate precisely the same apparent precipitation-induced weatheringfeatures as the Sphinx itself. And it is of interest to note that the survivinggranite casing blocks seem to have been carved on their inner faces to fit overthe limestone core-blocks at a time when these were already heavily marked byerosion. Since the granite casing has the look of other Old Kingdom Egyptianarchitecture (while the limestone core-blocks do not) this may be taken asfurther evidence of the theory that an ancient, revered and much-erodedstructure was restored and renovated by the Old Kingdom Pharaohs. Robert Schochcertainly favours this view. ‘I remain convinced,’ comments the BostonUniversity geology professor, ‘that the backs of the Old Kingdom granite facingstones were carved to match or complement the earlier weathering features seenon the surfaces of the core limestone blocks of the temples.’[74][index_split_036.html#filepos779794]Memorials mightyThe famous black diorite statue of Khafre that now stands in the Cairo Museumwas found upside down in a twenty-foot deep pit in the floor of the antechamberthat leads into the Valley Temple’s T-shaped central hall. Walking through thishall, hemmed in by immensely strong and thick limestone and granite walls, thevisitor will eventually come to a high, narrow passageway on the north-westernside of the structure. This passage leads out of the rear of the temple, alongthe southern side of the Sphinx trench—where it overlooks the Sphinx—and thencejoins with the massive ‘causeway’ that runs for more than 1000 feet up the slopeof the Giza plateau linking the Valley Temple to the Mortuary Temple and thenceto the eastern face of the second Pyramid.The causeways—one for each of the three Pyramids—are important features of theGiza necropolis, though all have fallen into an advanced state of disrepair.Some 20 feet wide, and varying in length from quarter of a mile up to half amile, they each originally linked a Mortuary Temple to a Valley Temple. Today,however, the only relatively intact complex is that attributed to Khafredescribed above. In the case of the third Pyramid, the Valley Temple is nowcompletely gone but the megalithic ruins of the Mortuary Temple are still inplace. In the case of the Great Pyramid the only remaining part of the MortuaryTemple is its basalt floor, while the ruins of the Valley Temple—if anysurvive—are buried under the village of Nazlet-el-Sammam.The three causeways, like the Mortuary and Valley Temples, are fashioned out ofhuge blocks of limestone. Indeed all of these prodigious structures are clearly‘of a piece’ from a design point of view and seem to have been the work ofbuilders who thought like gods or giants. There is about them an overwhelming,weary, aching sense of antiquity and it is certainly not hard to imagine thatthey might be the leavings of a lost civilization. In this regard we arereminded of The Sacred Sermon, a ‘Hermetic’ text of Egyptian origin that speakswith awe of lordly men ‘devoted to the growth of wisdom’ who lived ‘before theFlood’ and whose civilization was destroyed: ‘And there shall be memorialsmighty of their handiworks upon the earth, leaving dim trace behind when cyclesare renewed ...’[75] [index_split_036.html#filepos779908][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image004.jpg]4. The artificial ‘Horizon of Giza’.There is another feature of the causeways, of intense interest to us, which weshall explore in detail in Parts III and IV—their orientation. The causeway ofthe Third Pyramid, like the gaze of the Sphinx, is targeted due east. Thecauseway of the second Pyramid points 14 degrees south of due east. The causewayof the Great Pyramid points 14 degrees north of due east. The arrangement isprecise, geometrical, obviously deliberate, with each significant structurebearing a designed relationship to every other structure—and the whole containedwithin a large, circular artificial ‘horizon’ that is apparently centred on theapex of the second Pyramid with its rim lying just to the west of the rump ofthe Sphinx.Orthodox Egyptological opinion concerning the causeways is that they wereceremonial roads. Notwithstanding the fact that they are technologicalmasterpieces which could only have been built with an enormous expense ofingenuity and effort at the direction of skilled surveyors and architects, theassumption is that they were used just once for the funerary journey of thePharaoh’s corpse from Valley Temple to Mortuary Temple where his final embalmingrituals took place.Perhaps so. As we shall show in Parts III and IV, however, there are features ofthese causeways which suggest that they may have been used many times by manydifferent Pharaohs and that they have their technical and symbolic origins inevents that occurred long before the dawn of the historical civilization ofEgypt.Not purely symbolic boatsIn the 1850s Sir Richard Francis Burton, the British explorer and adventurer,visited Egypt and the Pyramids of Giza. He noted some odd ‘rhomboidaldepressions’ lying parallel to the eastern side of the Great Pyramid, close tothe end of its causeway, and made sketches of them which are now kept in theBritish Museum.[76] [index_split_036.html#filepos780212] Some years later, in1881, Sir William Flinders Petrie, the ‘Father of British Egyptology’, also sawthese strange depressions but simply referred to them as ‘trenches’ and did notbother to have them cleared.[77] [index_split_036.html#filepos780337]In 1893, buried in pits near a relatively obscure pyramid on another site, thefamous French Egyptologist de Morgan discovered six large wooden boats, butlittle was made of this. In 1901 another French Egyptologist, Chassinat,discovered a ‘rhomboidal pit’ near the pyramid of Djedefra at Abu Roash. Afternoting that it very much resembled the pits at Giza near the Great Pyramid, hewrote: ‘their purpose is unknown, as is the case here.’[78][index_split_036.html#filepos780542]Ancient Egyptian funerary texts are strewn with references to boats—notably thevarious solar and divine vessels on which the deceased hoped to voyage in thecosmic afterlife (the ‘boat of millions of years’ for example, the ‘bark ofOsiris’, and the ‘bark of Ra’). Carvings, drawings and paintings of such ‘boats’and ‘barks’, with their characteristic high prows and sterns, adorn the walls ofmany an ancient tomb in Egypt and their symbolic and religious functions wereunderstood well before the close of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless it wasonly when the German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt excavated an obvious andunmistakable boat made of bricks near the sun-temple and pyramids at Abusir,that it was recognized that the mysterious ‘rhomboidal pits’ were in factboats—or at any rate representations of boats, or graves for boats.Since Borchardt’s time, several other boat pits have been found—by Selim Hassanin 1933, for example, and by Walter Emery in 1937. Finally, in 1954, Kamalel-Mallakh discovered something quite breathtaking—a partially disassembledcedarwood boat, more than 143 feet long, buried in a pit on the south side ofthe Great Pyramid. Much more recently another vessel of similar dimensions hasbeen located in an adjacent pit. As yet unexcavated, it is apparently to bestudied by a Japanese consortium.The fact that Egyptologists took a long time to notice that there were largeboats buried at Giza does not necessarily mean that their analysis of thefunction of these boats is completely wrong. The idea is that the majesticvessels were intended in some ‘primitive’, ‘magical’, ‘superstitious’,‘half-savage’ way to serve as symbolic vehicles on which the souls of deadPharaohs could sail into Heaven. This interpretation is consistent with theancient Egyptian funerary texts and there can be little doubt that theboats—‘solar boats’ as the Egyptologists call them—were indeed intended to playa part in symbolic celestial journeys. As we shall see in Parts III and IV,however, it is possible that the precise nature and purpose of those journeysmay have been much more complex and significant than has hitherto beenrecognized.Meanwhile, standing in front of the ‘solar boat’ excavated from beside the southface of the Great Pyramid in 1954 it is hard not to note the marks of wear andtear on the keel and gangplank and the numerous other clear signs that thiselegant cedarwood vessel, with its high curving prow and stern, was sailed manytimes on water.[79] [index_split_036.html#filepos780698]If it was purely symbolic, why was it used?And why was it necessary to have such an elaborate and technicallyaccomplished[80] [index_split_036.html#filepos780863] craft for symbolicpurposes? Wouldn’t a symbolic vessel—such as the brick boats and boat ‘graves’found at other Pyramids—have done just as well?The PyramidsThe dominant features of the Giza necropolis are, of course, its three greatPyramids—those conventionally attributed to Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure. In asense they are what the entire, vast enterprise proclaims itself to be allabout, what the causeways lead towards, what the ‘solar boats’ are buriedbeside. Sprawling diagonally across the meridian axis of the site, it is they,above all else, that the geometrical ‘Horizon of Giza’ appears to have beendesigned to circumscribe. Nothing about them is accidental: their originalconstructed heights, their angles of slope, the measurement of their perimeters,even the pattern in which they are carefully laid out on the ground—all of thesethings are purposive and laden with meaning.Because we have described the Pyramids in such detail in other publications[81][index_split_036.html#filepos780960]—where we have also looked in depth intomany of their technical and engineering puzzles—we will not trouble the readerwith superfluous details here. Some basic statistics and a few points ofanalysis are, however, unavoidable at this stage.The Great Pyramid was originally 481.3949 feet in height (now reduced to just alittle over 450 feet) and its four sides each measure some 755 feet in length atthe base. The second Pyramid was originally slightly lower—with a designedheight of 471 feet—and has sides measuring just under 708 feet in length. Thethird Pyramid stands some 215 feet tall and has a side length at the base of 356feet.When they were built the second Pyramid and the Great Pyramid were both entirelycovered in limestone facing blocks, several courses of which still adhere to theupper levels of the former. The Great Pyramid, by contrast, is today almostcompletely bereft of its casing. We know from historical accounts, however, thatit was once clad from bottom to top with smoothly-polished Tura limestone whichwas shaken loose by a powerful earthquake that devastated the Cairo area in AD1301. The newly exposed core masonry was then used for some years as a crudelocal quarry to rebuild the shattered mosques and palaces of Cairo.All the Arab commentators prior to the fourteenth century tell us that the GreatPyramid’s casing was a marvel of architecture that caused the edifice to glowbrilliantly under the Egyptian sun. It consisted of an estimated 22 acres of8-foot-thick blocks, each weighing in the region of 16 tons, ‘so subtly jointedthat one would have said that it was a single slab from top to bottom’.[82][index_split_036.html#filepos781195] A few surviving sections can still be seentoday at the base of the monument. When they were studied in 1881 by Sir W. M.Flinders Petrie, he noted with astonishment that ‘the mean thickness of thejoints is 0.020 of an inch; and, therefore, the mean variation of the cutting ofthe stone from a straight line and from a true square is but 0.01 of an inch ona length of 75 inches up the face, an amount of accuracy equal to the mostmodern opticians’ straight-edges of such a length.’Another detail that Petrie found very difficult to explain was that the blockshad been carefully and precisely cemented together: ‘To merely place such stonesin exact contact at the sides would be careful work, but to do so with cement inthe joint seems almost impossible ...’[83] [index_split_036.html#filepos781530]Also ‘almost impossible’, since the mathematical value pi (3.14) is not supposedto have been calculated by any civilization until the Greeks stumbled upon it inthe third century BC,[84] [index_split_036.html#filepos781678] is the fact thedesigned height of the Great Pyramid—481.3949 feet—bears the same relationshipto its base perimeter (3023.16 feet) as does the circumference of any circle toits radius. This relationship is 2pi (i.e. 481.3949 feet x 2 x 3.14 = 3023.16feet).Equally ‘impossible’—at any rate for a people like the ancient Egyptians who aresupposed to have known nothing about the true shape and size of our planet—isthe relationship, in a scale of 1:43,200, that exists between the dimensions ofthe Pyramid and the dimensions of the earth. Setting aside for the moment thequestion of whether we are dealing with coincidence here, it is a simple fact,verifiable on any pocket calculator, that if you take the monument’s originalheight (481.3949 feet) and multiply it by 43,200 you get a quotient of 3938.685miles. This is an underestimate by just 11 miles of the true figure for thepolar radius of the earth (3949 miles) worked out by the best modern methods.Likewise, if you take the monument’s perimeter at the base (3023.16 feet) andmultiply this figure by 43,200 then you get 24,734.94 miles—a result that iswithin 170 miles of the true equatorial circumference of the earth (24,902miles). Moreover, although 170 miles sounds quite a lot, it amounts, in relationto the earth’s total circumference, to a minus-error of only three quarters of asingle per cent.High precisionSuch fine errors are within the general margins of tolerance found at the GreatPyramid. Indeed, although it has a footprint of over 13 acres, and consists ofsome six and a half million tons of limestone and granite blocks, the sheer massand size of this monster of monuments are not its most impressivecharacteristics. More astounding by far is the incredible high-tech precisionthat is built into every aspect of its design.Before going into the details, let us consider the implications of very fineprecision in very large monuments.An analogy with the simple wrist-watch helps. If you are after an accuracy of,say, a few seconds per week, then an ordinary quartz watch costing fifty dollarsor less will do the trick. If you want accuracy to within a fraction of a secondper year, however, then the quartz watch will no longer serve and you will haveto turn to something of the order of an atomic clock.A similar situation applies in the construction industry. If you are building abrick wall that is to appear straight within plus or minus 1 degree per 100metres and the whole roughly directed due north, then any good bricklayer shouldbe able to meet your specification. However, if your requirement is for a wallthat is straight within 1 arc minute per 100 metres and directed exactly duenorth, then you are going to need a laser theodolite, an ordnance survey mapaccurate to 10 metres, and a highly qualified team of professionals including anexpert setting-out engineer, an astronomer, a surveyor, several master-masonsand a week or so to ensure that the precision you are aiming for has in factbeen achieved.Such ‘atomic clock’ precision was achieved by the builders of the Great Pyramidmore than 4500 years ago. This is not a matter of historical speculation, or oftheory, but of plain, measurable facts.For example the earth’s equatorial circumference of 24,902 miles works out ataround 132 million feet, with the result that a degree of latitude at theequator is equivalent to approximately 366,600 feet (i.e. 132 million feetdivided by 360 degrees). Each degree is divided into 60 arc minutes, which meansthat 1 arc minute represents just over 6100 feet on the earth’s surface, andeach arc minute is then further subdivided into 60 arc seconds—with the resultthat 1 arc second is equivalent to a distance of about 101 feet. This system ofmeasuring by degrees is not a modern convention but rather an inheritance ofscientific thinking, connected to ‘base 60’ mathematics, that dates back to theremotest antiquity.[85] [index_split_036.html#filepos781797] Nobody knows where,or when, it originated.[86] [index_split_036.html#filepos781958] It seems,however, to have been employed in the geodetic and astronomical calculationsthat were used to locate the Great Pyramid—for the monument is positioned barelya mile to the south of latitude 30, i.e. almost exactly one third of the waybetween the equator and the north pole.[87] [index_split_036.html#filepos782043][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image005.jpg]5. Geodetic location of the Great Pyramid of Giza on latitude 30 degrees north(one third of the way between the equator and the north pole) and at the centreof the world’s habitable landmasses.It is unlikely that this choice of location could have come about by chance.Moreover, because no suitable site for such a massive structure exists a mile orso to the north, it would be inadvisable to assume that the fractional offsetfrom the thirtieth parallel could have been caused by a surveying error on thepart of the Pyramid builders.This offset amounts to 1 arc minute and 9 arc seconds—since the Pyramid’s truelatitude is 29 degrees 58’ 51”. Interestingly, however, as a former AstronomerRoyal of Scotland has observed:‘If the original designer had wished that men should see with their bodily,rather than their mental eyes, the pole of the sky from the foot of the GreatPyramid, at an altitude before them of 30 degrees, he would have had to takeaccount of the refraction of the atmosphere; and that would have necessitatedthe building standing not at latitude 30 degrees, but at latitude 29 degrees 58’22”.’[88] [index_split_036.html#filepos782210]In other words the monument turns out to be situated less than half an arcminute to the north of astronomical latitude 30 degrees, uncorrected foratmospheric refraction. Any ‘error’ involved is thus reduced to less than halfof one-sixtieth of one degree—a hair’s breadth in terms of the earth’scircumference as a whole.The same obsessive concern with accuracy is found in the orderly evenness of thePyramid’s base:[89] [index_split_036.html#filepos782303]Length of West side: 755 feet 9.1551 inches Length of North side: 755 feet 4.9818 inches Length of East side: 755 feet 10.4937 inches Length of South side: 756 feet 0.9739 inches The variation between the longest and shortest sides is therefore less than 8inches—about one tenth of 1 per cent—quite an amazing feat when we consider thatwe are measuring a distance of over 9000 inches carpeted with thousands of hugelimestone blocks weighing several tons each.There is no sign that the ancient Pyramid builders were in any way daunted bythe task of maintaining such fastidious standards of symmetry on such a grandscale. On the contrary, as though willingly seeking out additional technicalchallenges, they went on to equip the monument with corners set at almostperfect right-angles. The variation from 90 degrees is just 0 degrees 00’ 02” atthe north-west corner, 0 degrees 03’ 02” at the north-east corner, 0 degrees 03’33” at the south-east corner, and 0 degrees 00’ 33” at the south-westcorner.[90] [index_split_036.html#filepos782607]This, it must be conceded, is not just ‘atomic clock’ accuracy but the Rolex,BMW, Mercedes Benz, Rolls-Royce and IBM of building engineering all rolled intoone.And there is more.It is fairly well known that the Pyramid was aligned by its architects to thecardinal points (with its north face directed north, its east face directedeast, etc., etc.). Less well known is just how eerily exact is the precision ofthese alignments—with the average deviation from true being only a little over 3arc minutes (i.e. about 5 per cent of a single degree).[91][index_split_036.html#filepos782692]Why such meticulousness?Why such rigour?Why should even the most megalomaniacal of Pharaohs have cared whether hismassive ‘tomb’ was aligned within 3 arc minutes of true north—or indeed within awhole degree of true north? To the naked-eye observer it is virtually impossibleto determine such a deviation. Indeed most of us could not spot a misalignmentwithin 3 whole degrees (180 arc minutes), let alone within 3 arc minutes (andsome people have trouble telling the general direction of north at all). So thequestion has to be asked: what was all this incredible precision for? Why didthe builders burden themselves with so much extra work and difficulty when theeffects of their additional labours would not be visible to the naked eyeanyway?They must, one assumes, have had a powerful motive to create what is truly amiracle of the surveyor’s art.And what makes this miracle all the more remarkable is the fact that it was notperformed on a perfectly flat area of ground, as one might expect, but with amassive natural mound, or hill, left exactly in the middle of the site on whichthe Great Pyramid was being erected. Estimated to be almost 30 feet high—as tallas a two-storey house—and positioned dead centre over the base area (of which itoccupies approximately 70 per cent), this primeval mound was skilfullyincorporated into the lower courses of the growing edifice. No doubt itspresence has contributed down the epochs to the structure’s legendary stability.It is extremely difficult, however, to understand how the ancient surveyors wereable to square the base of the Pyramid in its early and most important stageswith the mound so solidly in the way (squaring the base normally involves takingrepeated diagonal measurements across the corners).[92][index_split_036.html#filepos782837] All that we can say for sure is that thebase is square and that the monument is locked into the cardinal axes of ourplanet with great care and precision.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image006.jpg]6. Cross-section of the Great Pyramid of Egypt showing the natural mound ofbedrock that is known to be built into its lower courses.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image007.jpg]7. Internal corridors and passageways of the three Pyramids of Giza.Chambers and passagewaysThe second and third Pyramids have relatively simple internal chambers andpassageway systems—the former having one principal chamber just below groundlevel, positioned centrally under the apex of the monument, the latter havingthree main chambers, cut a little more deeply into the bedrock but againpositioned centrally under the apex of the monument. The entrances to bothPyramids are in their north faces and take the form of cramped passagewayssloping downwards at an angle of 26 degrees, before levelling off to joinhorizontal corridors under the monument.The internal structure of the Great Pyramid, by contrast, is much more complex,with an elaborate arrangement of passageways and galleries—sloping up and downagain at 26 degrees—and with three principal internal chambers. Of these latteronly one, the ‘Subterranean Chamber’, is below ground level. The other two—theso-called ‘Queen’s Chamber’ and ‘King’s Chamber’—are both located in the heartof the monument’s superstructure at substantial altitudes above the ground.The layout of these internal features is best appreciated from the diagramprinted on page 45. Chief amongst them, surmounted only by Davison’s Chamber(and above that by the four so-called ‘relieving chambers’ which contain the‘quarry marks’ mentioned earlier) is the—rectangular red-granite room, nowfamous as the ‘King’s Chamber’. It proved to be completely devoid of eithertreasures or inscriptions, or the body of a king, when it was first entered byCalif Al Mamoun in the ninth century AD. Measuring 34 feet 4 inches in length,17 feet 2 inches in width, and 19 feet 1 inch in height it is located about 150feet vertically above the base of the Pyramid. Its many mysteries are too wellknown to require further elucidation here (and, besides, have been described insome detail in our earlier publications[93][index_split_036.html#filepos782999]).[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image008.jpg]8. Principal internal features of the Great Pyramid. The entrance in the northface known as ‘Mamoun’s Hole’ was forced by Arab explorers in the ninth centuryAD. At this time the exterior facing blocks of the Pyramid were still intact,hiding the true entrance from sight.Connecting the King’s Chamber to the lower levels of the monument is the GrandGallery, one of ‘the most celebrated architectural works which have survivedfrom the Old Kingdom’.[94] [index_split_036.html#filepos783182] Slopingdownwards at an angle of 26 degrees, it is an astonishing corbel-vaulted hallfully 153 feet in length and 7 feet in width at floor level. Its lofty ceiling,28 feet above the visitor’s head, is just visible in the electric lighting withwhich the Pyramid has been equipped in modern times.At the base of the Grand Gallery a horizontal passage, 3 feet 9 inches high and127 feet long, runs due south into the ‘Queen’s Chamber’. Again found empty byMamoun, this is a smaller room than the King’s Chamber, measuring 18 feet 10inches from east to west and 17 feet 2 inches from north to south. Reaching aheight of 20 feet 5 inches, the ceiling is gabled (whereas it is flat in theKing’s Chamber) and there is a large corbelled niche of unknown function justsouth of the centre line in the east wall.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image009.jpg]9. Detail of the corridors, chambers and shafts of the Great Pyramid.Returning along the horizontal passageway to its junction with the base of theGrand Gallery the visitor will note, behind a modern iron grille, the narrow anduninviting mouth of the ‘Well-Shaft’—a near vertical tunnel, often less than 3feet in diameter, that eventually joins up with the Descending Corridor, almost100 feet below ground level. How the tunnelers, encysted in solid rock, wereable to home in so accurately on their target remains a mystery. Mysterious,too, is the true function of all these odd systems of interconnecting ‘ducts’which lead busily hither and thither inside the body of the monument, like thecircuits of some great machine.Sloping downwards from the Grand Gallery, and extending it in the direction ofthe ground at the continuing angle of 26 degrees, is another corridor. Known(from the point of view of those entering the Pyramid) as the AscendingCorridor, it measures 3 feet 11 inches high by 3 feet 5 inches wide and has atotal length of just under 129 feet. Leaving the Pyramid, the visitor is obligedto ape-walk uncomfortably down the Ascending Corridor until the point where itjoins up with ‘Mamoun’s Hole’—the tunnel that the Arabs cut for their forcedentry in the ninth century—on the western side of two hulking red-granite‘plugging blocks’ which mask the junction with the Descending Corridor. At thebottom of this 350-foot-long corridor, off limits to all but bona fideEgyptologists (and those willing to bribe the increasingly hard-pressed anddemoralized Inspectors and ghafirs responsible for the day-to-day administrationof Giza) is a truly remarkable feature—the Subterranean Chamber that nestles insolid bedrock more than 100 feet below the surface of the plateau (and almost600 feet below the Pyramid’s lofty summit platform).Inner spaceThe first thing that the intrepid visitor should do, after gaining access to theDescending Corridor, is to climb up it a few feet in the direction of thePyramid’s true entrance. Now covered with an iron grille, this entrance islocated in the monument’s north face, nine courses above and 24 feet to the eastof ‘Mamoun’s Hole’ (through which all members of the public enter the Pyramidtoday).Here, at the point in the ceiling of the Descending Corridor where the mouth ofthe Ascending Corridor was hewn upwards, it is possible to inspect the bottomend of the lowermost of the two plugging blocks. It is as firmly jammed in placetoday as it was when Mamoun’s diggers first encountered it in the ninth century,and it is easy to understand why its presence there encouraged them to tunnelround it into the softer limestone, seeking a way past the obstacle and into theupper reaches of whatever lay beyond.Perhaps this was exactly what the Pyramid builders had ‘programmed’ those earlyexplorers to do. After all, if you see that a huge chunk of granite has beenhauled into place to block what is obviously an upwards-sloping corridor, thenit is only human nature to try to get into that corridor—which Mamoun’s men did.More than a thousand years later, tourists and archaeologists still follow thetrail that those pioneering Arabs blazed around the plugging blocks into themain north-south axis of the Pyramid’s system of passageways. And though therehave been all manner of hackings and tunnellings in search of furtherpassageways (in the floors and walls of the King’s and Queen’s Chambers, forexample), the plugs at the base of the Ascending Corridor have neversubsequently been disturbed.This is an understandable oversight if one is satisfied that the sole functionof these plugs was to block the Ascending Corridor in a north-south direction.Why, however, has no one ever tried to find out if anything lies behind theireastern aspect?[95] [index_split_036.html#filepos783326] As well as having thesame height and width as the Ascending Corridor, thus filling it completely,each of the plugs is about four feet in length—and thus easily long enough toconceal the entrance to a second and completely separate passageway systembranching off at right angles towards the east.There is certainly room for such a second system inside the Great Pyramid—andfor much else besides. Indeed it has been calculated that as many as 3700 fullyconstructed chambers, each the size of the existing King’s Chamber could beaccommodated within the monument’s vast ‘inner space’ of 8.5 million cubicfeet.[96] [index_split_036.html#filepos783460]The stones of darkness and the shadow of deathHaving examined the plugging blocks, the visitor is faced by a long climb downthe full 350-foot length of the Descending Corridor, initially through masonryand thence into bedrock. As the journey proceeds, the rays of sunlightpenetrating the barred entrance to the north grow progressively weaker and onehas the sense of dropping like a deep-sea diver into the dark depths of amidnight-black ocean.The corridor, which every intuition proclaims to be a remotely ancient,prehistoric feature, is 3 feet 11 inches high by 3 feet 6 inches wide and mayoriginally have been cut into the 30-foot-tall rocky mound that occupied thissite millennia before the Pyramid was built. It is unsettling, therefore, todiscover that it is machine-age straight from top to bottom. According toFlinders Petrie, the variation along the whole passage ‘is under 1/4 inch in thesides and 3/10 inch on the roof’.[97] [index_split_036.html#filepos783697] Inaddition there is one segment of the corridor, 150 feet in length, where ‘theaverage error of straightness is only one fiftieth of an inch, an amazinglyminute amount.’[98] [index_split_036.html#filepos783839]With hunched back, the visitor continues down this long, straight corridorsloping due south into the bedrock of the Giza plateau at the now familiar angleof 26 degrees. As ever greater depths are plumbed it is hard not to growincreasingly conscious of the tremendous mass of limestone that is piled aboveand of the heavy, dusty, unfresh fug of the subterranean air—like the exhalationof some cyclopean beast. Looking back apprehensively towards the entrance, onenotices that the penetrating light has been reduced to a glimmering star-burst,high up and far away. And it is normal, at this point, to feel a concomitantglimmer of apprehension, a slight tug of anxiety at the extent of one’sseparation from the world above.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image010.jpg]10. The complex internal design of the Great Pyramid. It is possible that manyother passageways and chambers remain to be discovered within the giganticmonument.On the west side of the corridor, quite near the bottom, is an alcove, againcovered by an iron grille, that gives access to the vertical Well-Shaft andthence to the Grand Gallery and the upper chambers. Soon afterwards the20-degree descending slope levels off into a low horizontal passageway, running29 feet from north to south, through which the visitor is obliged to crawl onall fours. Near the end of this passageway, again on the west side, is anotheralcove, 6 feet long and 3 feet deep, that has been roughly hewn out of thebedrock and that ends in a blind, unfinished wall. Then, after a further 4 feetof crawling, the horizontal passageway opens at a height of about 2 feet abovefloor level into the Subterranean Chamber.Were it not for a single low-wattage electric bulb installed in modern times,the visitor would now be in complete darkness. The light that the bulb casts hasa greenish, sepulchral hue, and what it reveals is a most peculiar room,considerably larger than the King’s Chamber, measuring 46 feet along itseast-west axis, and 27 feet 1 inch from north to south, but with a maximumheight of just 11 feet 6 inches.[99] [index_split_036.html#filepos783924] In theapproximate centre of the floor, on the east side, is a railing surrounding asquare pit reaching a depth of about 10 feet, and beyond that, penetrating thesouth wall, is a second horizontal corridor, 2 feet 4 inches square, running duesouth into the bedrock for a further 53 feet and terminating in a blank wall.Looking to the right, one notes that the floor of the western side of theChamber rises up into a kind of chest-high platform. This has been irregularlytrenched, creating four parallel ‘fins’ of limestone running east to west,almost touching the relatively flat roof at some points but with a clearance ofup to six feet in others.All these strange features conspire to create an oppressive, claustrophobicatmosphere in the room that reminds the visitor of how far beneath the ground hehas burrowed, and of how inescapably he could be entombed here if there were tobe any serious collapse of the millions of tons of limestone above his head.Very interesting developmentsEgyptological opinion concerning the Subterranean Chamber may be summarized asfollows: (1) it is not a prehistoric feature, but was built at the same time asthe Pyramid (i.e. around 2500 BC); (2) it was initially intended to be theburial place of Khufu; (3) then the Pharaoh and his architects changed theirminds, stopped work on it, and turned their attentions to the main body of thePyramid—where they built first the Queen’s Chamber (also later ‘abandoned’according to this theory) and then finally the King’s Chamber.[100][index_split_036.html#filepos784095]If the Egyptologists are right then the excavation and removal of more than 2000tons of solid rock in order to create the Descending Corridor—rock that firsthad to be mined and then hauled to the surface from increasingly greater depthsthrough that cramped, unventilated, 26-degree channel—would all have beenundertaken in vain. Vain, too, would have been the hewing out of theSubterranean Chamber itself, and also of its further shafts and pits. Indeed thewhole enterprise would, in retrospect, have been entirely pointless if the endresult had merely been to leave, at a depth of more than 100 feet below the Gizaplateau, an unfinished, rough-walled, low-ceilinged crypt—‘resembling aquarry’[101] [index_split_036.html#filepos784193]—for which nobody would everhave any use.This obviously defies common sense. An alternative scenario does exist, however,which has stimulated the curiosity of a number of investigators during the lasttwo centuries. According to this scenario the Chamber was deliberately leftunfinished so as to hoodwink treasure hunters into believing that it had beenabandoned and thus convince them of the pointlessness of further explorationsthere—a pretty effective means of keeping casual intruders away from any othercavities or concealed passageways that might be connected to it.With such suspicions in mind, the Italian explorer Giovanni Battista Cavigliaand the British adventurer Colonel Howard Vyse both felt inspired (between 1830and 1837) to drill holes into the bottom of the pit at the centre of theSubterranean Chamber. They extended its original depth of 10 feet by a further35 feet (now largely filled in).More recently the French archaeologist, André Pochan, has drawn attention to acurious passage from the Greek historian Herodotus who visited Egypt in thefifth century BC and spent much time interviewing priests and other learned menthere. Herodotus reports that he was told quite specifically of the existence of‘underground chambers on the hill on which the Pyramids stand ... These chambersKing Cheops [Khufu] made as burial chambers for himself in a kind of island,bringing in a channel from the Nile ....’[102][index_split_036.html#filepos784287]Pochan has calculated that if there really is a chamber fed by Nile water underthe Pyramid, then it would have to be at a great depth—at least 90 feet belowthe pit. Likewise the Danish architect Hubert Paulsen has argued on the basis ofgeometry that the most probable place for any further chamber to be found in theGreat Pyramid is underneath the pit[103] [index_split_036.html#filepos784471]—aview that is also supported by the calculations of the British geometer RobinCook.[104] [index_split_036.html#filepos784619]It is a French engineer, however, Professor Jean Kerisel, who has mostvigorously pursued the quest for concealed subterranean chambers. The currentPresident of the Association France-Egypte, he was in the pit with hisassistants on 12 October 1992 when a major earthquake occurred, demolishinglarge parts of Cairo. This experience, he stated later, gave the researchers ‘afew very unpleasant moments some 35 metres under the plateau’.[105][index_split_036.html#filepos784778]Happily, the Subterranean Chamber did not collapse and Kerisel and his team wereable to finish their work. This involved the use of two nondestructivetechniques: ground-penetrating radar and microgravimetry. The results wereinconclusive in the chamber itself but extremely promising in the horizontalpassageway that connects it to the end of the Descending Corridor. In Kerisel’sown words: ‘a structure was detected under the floor of the passageway, whichcould be a corridor oriented SSE-NNW whose ceiling is at the depth that theDescending Corridor would have reached had it been prolonged.’[106][index_split_036.html#filepos785030]Nor was this all. A second very clear anomaly, a ‘mass defect’ as Kerisel callsit, ‘was detected on the western side of the passageway six metres before thechamber entrance. According to our calculations, this anomaly corresponds to avertical shaft at least five metres deep with a section of about 1.40 x 1.40metres very close to the western wall of the passageway.[107][index_split_036.html#filepos785122]In short, what Kerisel believes he has identified off the Subterranean Chamber’sentrance corridor is something that looks very much like a completely separatepassageway system, terminating in a vertical shaft. His instruments may havemisled him, or, as he himself admits, he may merely have picked up the traces of‘a large volume of limestone dissolved by the action of underground water—inother words a deep cave’.[108] [index_split_036.html#filepos785208]Alternatively, however, if the ‘mass defect’ turns out to be a man-made feature,as he strongly suspects, then ‘it may lead to very interestingdevelopments’.[109] [index_split_036.html#filepos785300]LabyrinthIt should be obvious that a civilization that could build up to the height ofthe Great Pyramid’s summit platform, that could create giant stone statues morethan 240 feet long, and that could lift the 200-ton blocks of the Valley andMortuary Temples into place (forming intricate jigsaw-puzzle patterns at heightsof 40 feet and more above the ground) would not have experienced anyinsurmountable difficulty in building down as well. On the contrary, such acivilization could, if it had so wished, have hewn out underground complexes ofimmense size, connected to one another by labyrinths of tunnels.The possibility therefore cannot be ruled out that the Subterranean Chamberunder the Great Pyramid could be just one of many such deeply buried features.Indeed, as the reader will recall, the seismological work carried out at Giza inthe early 1990s by the American geophysicist Thomas Dobecki did indicate thepresence of a large and apparently man-made hypogeum in the bedrock beneath theSphinx. Ultimately only further excavations and research can shed further lighton these matters. Meanwhile, however, there is a great deal of evidence from allparts of the necropolis which suggests that the creation of ambitious rock-hewnstructures—both above and below the ground—was, indeed, part of the standardrepertoire of the Pyramid builders. They also quite frequently chose to minglerock-hewn and built-up structures—as in the case of the tomb of Khent-Khawes, asupposed Queen of Menkaure, which consists of a natural outcropping sculpted inpyramidial form surmounted by a curious sarcophagus-shaped temple.A more spectacular and conspicuous mixture of rock-hewn and built-up featuresoccurs at the Pyramid of Khafre. It stands on an artificially levelled 12-acreplatform cut bodily out of the plateau—which slopes steeply from north-west tosouth-east at this point (i.e. it is higher in the west and lower in the east).In consequence the north and west sides of the Pyramid are enclosed within atrench that decreases steadily in height from about 20 feet at the north-westcorner to about 10 feet at the southwest corner—and to zero at the north-eastand south-east corners. The lower courses of the Pyramid itself on the north andwest sides are contoured out of the central mound of bedrock that the buildersleft in place after hollowing out the trench. On the east and south sides,however, the slope of the plateau falls below the level chosen for the base ofthe Pyramid. The builders solved this problem by bringing thousands of enormousfilling blocks to the site—average weight about 100 tons each—to create anunshakable horizontal foundation. They then went on to lay the first few coursesof the monument on the eastern and southern sides using the same unwieldymegaliths. Thereafter they reverted to smaller blocks and in consequence a cleardemarcation line is visible between the two types of construction. Like some ofthe characteristics of the Sphinx and Valley Temples referred to earlier, thisdemarcation gives the impression not just of different building techniques butactually of two distinctly different stages of building separated by an unknowninterval of time.The mystery of the shaftsThere is one other anomalous feature of the Giza necropolis which we have notyet mentioned but with which we shall close this chapter as it leads us on tothe next stage of our investigation. This feature is confined to the GreatPyramid and is unique in ancient Egyptian architecture. It takes the form offour narrow shafts—usually described by Egyptologists as ‘ventilationchannels’—two of which emanate respectively from the northern and southern wallsof the King’s Chamber and the other two from the northern and southern walls ofthe Queen’s Chamber.The four shafts have an average cross-section of 23 x 22 cm. and lengths thatvary from about 24 metres (northern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber) to about 65metres (northern shaft of the King’s Chamber). They are all inclined to thehorizontal plane of the Pyramid and their angles of slope vary from 32 degrees28 minutes (northern shaft of the King’s Chamber) to 45 degrees 14 minutes(southern shaft of the King’s Chamber). The shafts were constructed in astep-by-step manner as the Pyramid rose in height (i.e. they were not drilledthrough the masonry as some have supposed) and they reveal the use of verycomplex and sophisticated engineering and levelling techniques.It has been suggested that the reason for their inclination was to find the‘shortest route’ to the outside of the Pyramid and this has been taken to implythat the ancient builders wanted to ‘save’ work and time. However, suchgeometrical logic goes very much against engineering logic—for the simple reasonthat building shafts on an incline would not save time or work at all. Quite thecontrary: no construction engineer or builder could possibly agree that the‘shortest route’ is the best route in this case—even though it may seem so tothose looking only at the geometry. The truth, as Egyptian architect Dr.Alexander Badawy first noted in the 1960s, is that to build inclined shaftsrather than to have simple horizontal channels leading to the outside of thePyramid would create many difficulties—and especially so when we consider thehigh precision and rigid consistency of the inclinations.[110][index_split_036.html#filepos785404][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image011.jpg]11. The King’s and Queen’s Chambers and their four shafts. Note that the shaftsof the Queen’s Chamber were not originally cut through into the chamber butstopped short several inches from the inner walls. The shafts were opened in1872 by the British engineer Waynman Dixon.To build inclined shafts rather than horizontal ones entails five tediousoperations. First, the base course must be prepared; this calls for the shapingof special blocks with their upper faces sloping to serve as the ‘floor’ of eachshaft. Secondly, more special blocks have to be prepared with U-shaped innerfaces to form the profile, i.e., the ‘walls’ and ‘ceilings’ of the shafts.Thirdly, yet more special blocks have to be cut with their undersides inclinedin order to cover the sides of the shafts. Fourthly, the tops of the shafts mustbe covered with other special blocks with sloping undersides. Fifthly, the mainmasonry courses of the Pyramid have to be integrated with these special designfeatures along the entire lengths of the shafts.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image012.jpg]12. Details of the Queen’s Chamber and its shafts.If ventilation was really the objective then the question that must be asked isthis: why opt for such complications and difficulties when an effective flow ofair could have been provided for the chambers in a much simpler way? From anengineer’s point of view the obvious solution would have been to leave a masonryjoint open—say 20 cm.—running horizontally from the top of each chamber right tothe outside of the monument. In this case no special cutting of blocks wouldhave been necessary, nor indeed any tedious alignments or levelling work.In other words the ‘shortest route’ is not by any means the best route for thepractical purposes of ventilation and, besides, it should be obvious that thePyramid builders were not interested in time/energy-saving schemes—otherwisethey would not have favoured such gigantic, multimillion-ton monuments in thefirst place. It therefore follows that we are unlikely to be rewarded in seekingan explanation for the precise north-south alignments of these steeply inclinedshafts in terms of a time/energy-saving rationale based on quaint geometricalfigures.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image013.jpg]13. Queen’s Chamber wall and shaft mouth.Any doubt over this issue can be resolved by a close study of the shafts of theQueen’s Chamber. Unlike the King’s Chamber shafts, those in the Queen’s Chamber(a) do not exit on the outside of the monument and (b) were not originally cutthrough the Chamber’s limestone walls. Instead the builders left the last fiveinches intact in the last block over the mouth of each of the shafts—thusrendering them invisible and inaccessible to any casual intruder. With the helpof a steel chisel, they were finally discovered in 1872 by the British engineerWaynman Dixon, a Freemason whose curiosity had been aroused by the shafts in theKing’s Chamber and who decided to look for similar features in the Queen’sChamber.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image014.jpg]14. Construction details of the Great Pyramid’s shafts. At least four differentkinds of blocks (A, B, C and D), continuing the full length of the shafts, wererequired for the successful completion of these mysterious features of thePyramid. The engineering problems would have been immense. The notion that theprimary purpose of the shafts was for ventilation is disproved by the fact thatthe Queen’s Chamber shafts were originally closed at both ends and by thecomplexity of the design—which would not have been necessary if simpleventilation had been the objective.In later chapters we will be considering the implications of Dixon’s 1872discovery, and the follow-up to it. The point that we wish to make here,however, is the obvious one that shafts which were originally closed at bothends could not possibly have been used, or intended, for ventilation. They must,therefore, have had some higher purpose—one that was thought by the builders tojustify the enormous care, skill and effort involved in constructing them.As we shall see, that ‘higher purpose’ can now be identified with certainty."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4> > Stars and Time‘The various apparent movements of the heavenly bodies which are produced by therotation and revolution of the earth, and the effects of precession, werefamiliar to the Egyptians ... They carefully studied what they saw, and puttheir knowledge together in the most convenient fashion, associating it withtheir strange imaginings and their system of worship ...’J. Norman Lockyer, The Dawn Of Astronomy, 1894It is humbling and awe-inspiring to stand at dawn between the paws of the GreatSphinx of Egypt and to look up as the rising sun illuminates its face. Thecolossal statue seems ancient—almost as old, one might imagine, as time itself.And, as we saw in Chapter 2, a mounting body of geological evidence suggeststhat it is ancient—vastly older than the 4500 years allocated to it byEgyptologists and perhaps dating back as far as the last Ice Age when nocivilization capable of fashioning such a monument is supposed to have existed.Such notions are of course controversial and hotly disputed. Moreover, as shouldbe obvious by now, geology is incapable of providing us with a precisechronology and is particularly limited by the present state of our knowledge ofpalaeo-climatology. Indeed, the most we can say, on the sole basis of themonument’s erosion patterns, is that it does appear to have been carved at amuch earlier date than Egyptologists believe but that its antiquity could rangeanywhere between 15,000 BC and 5000 BC.There is, however, another science which, provided one essential precondition isfulfilled, can provide a much more accurate dating—to within a few decades—ofuninscribed ancient stone monuments. This is the science of archaeoastronomy.The precondition upon which it depends for its successful functioning is thatthe monuments studied should have been accurately aligned to the stars or to therising points of the sun by their builders.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image015.jpg]15. On the summer solstice at the latitude of Giza the sun rises 28 degreesnorth of east, on the winter solstice it rises 28 degrees south of east and onthe equinoxes it rises due east. The Great Sphinx of Giza is an astronomicalmonument orientated perfectly towards due east and thus serves as a superbequinoctial marker or ‘pointer’.The Great Sphinx fulfils this precondition. It lies exactly along the east-westaxis of the Giza necropolis with its patient and eternal gaze set perfectlytowards due east. It is, therefore, a superb ‘equinoctial marker’: its eyestarget the exact position of sunrise at dawn on the spring equinox.To clarify matters a little, astronomers speak of four ‘cardinal moments’ in theyear: the summer solstice—the longest day in the northern hemisphere—when theearth’s north pole points most directly at the sun, the winter solstice, theshortest day, when the pole points most directly away from the sun, and thespring and autumn equinoxes when the earth lies broadside-on to the sun and whennight and day are of equal length.On the summer solstice at the latitude of Giza, the sun rises about 28 degreesnorth of east. On the winter solstice it rises about 28 degrees south of east.By contrast, the main characteristic of the equinoxes (here and everywhere elsearound the globe) is that the sun always rises due east providing a sure andaccurate geodetic reference to one of the cardinal directions.It is towards this reference point, with high precision, that the gaze of theSphinx is set—not by accident, but by design, and as part of a vast, archaicastronomical plan of uncanny accuracy and intelligence.ObservatoryThousands of years ago, under the clear skies of a younger world, Egypt’s Gizaplateau must have been the ultimate observatory. From the high ground half amile to the west of the Sphinx on which the three principal Pyramids stand,there would have been a faultless 360-degree view around an enormous circularhorizon—a prospect that would have invited observations of the rising andsetting points of the sun throughout the year, and also of the rising andsetting points of the stars. It is certain, furthermore, whatever the otherfunctions of the necropolis, that it was indeed used for practical and preciseobservational astronomy of the kind developed by navigators to pinpoint thepositions of ships on the open ocean. Like the ability to keep strictly to achosen course, the fabulous accuracy with which the principal monuments of Gizaare aligned to true north, south, east and west could not have been achieved byany other science.[111] [index_split_036.html#filepos785653]Details of these alignments have already been given in Chapter 3. It istherefore sufficient here to remind ourselves that the Great Pyramid stands at apoint on the earth’s surface exactly one third of the way between the equatorand the north pole (i.e. astride latitude 30) and that its ‘meridional’ (i.e.north-south) axis is aligned to within three-sixtieths of a single degree oftrue north-south. It is a small but significant point that this alignment ismore accurate than that of the Meridian Building at the Greenwich Observatory inLondon—which is offset by an error of nine-sixtieths of a degree. In ouropinion, such precision constitutes a ‘fact’ which archaeologists andEgyptologists have never seriously considered, i.e. that the Great Pyramid, withits 13-acre footprint and six million tons of mass, could only have beensurveyed and set out by master astronomers.[112][index_split_036.html#filepos785820][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image016.jpg]16.

The trajectory of the sun on the winter solstice.It is our conviction that this ‘astronomical factor’ deserves to be given muchgreater prominence than it has hitherto been accorded by Egyptologists.Moreover, thanks to the recent development of sophisticated star-mappingcomputer programs, it is possible for us to simulate the skies over Giza in anyepoch during the past 30,000 years and thus to recreate the celestialenvironment in which the Pyramid builders worked.Standing as it were beneath those ancient skies, initiated by microchip into thecosmic secret of the changing positions of the stars, certain features of thekey monuments—features that are of no significance from the purelyarchaeological or Egyptological perspective—begin to take on a peculiar meaning.Targeting StarsLet us begin with the four mysterious shafts emanating from the King’s andQueen’s Chambers of the Great Pyramid, the engineering aspects of which weconsidered at the end of the previous chapter. As we have seen, two of theseshafts are aligned perfectly to due north and the other two perfectly to duesouth. They thus target, at varying altitudes, what astronomers refer to as the‘meridian’—an imaginary line ‘dividing the sky’ that is best envisaged as a hoopconnecting the north and south poles and passing directly over the observer’shead. It is as they cross this imaginary line (‘transit the meridian’) that thestars (and also the sun, moon and planets) are said to ‘culminate’—that is,reach their maximum altitude above the horizon.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image019.jpg]19.

Culmination (meridian-transit) of Orion’s belt circa 2500 BC.

For the ancient Egyptians the constellation of Orion, and particularly itsthree prominent belt stars, were strongly associated with Osiris, the god ofresurrection and rebirth.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image022.jpg]22. The stellar alignments of the Great Pyramid’s four shafts in the epoch of2500 BC.The Great Pyramid has numerous features which leave us without any doubt thatits designers paid careful attention to the stars and tracked their transit atthe meridian. The mouth of the original entrance corridor, for example, targetsthe meridian with the precision of the barrel of an artillery piece. All theinternal passageways, too, run perfectly north-south, thus making the wholemonument, as many astronomers have noted, an obvious ‘meridionalinstrument’.[113] [index_split_036.html#filepos785962] Most conclusive of all,however, is the fine accuracy of the four shafts. Recent investigations haveestablished beyond any shadow of doubt that in circa 2500 BC—the era recognizedby Egyptologists as the ‘Pyramid Age’—each one of these shafts targeted aspecial star as it culminated at the meridian:From the Queen’s Chamber, the northern shaft is angled at 39 degrees and wasaimed at the star Kochab (Beta Ursa Minor) in the constellation of the LittleBear—a star associated by the ancients with ‘cosmic regeneration’ and theimmortality of the soul. The southern shaft, on the other hand, which is angledat 39 degrees 30’, was aimed at the bright star Sirius (Alpha Canis Major) inthe constellation of the Great Dog. This star the ancients associated with thegoddess Isis, cosmic mother of the kings of Egypt.[114][index_split_036.html#filepos786131]From the King’s Chamber, the northern shaft is angled at 32 degrees 28’ and wasaimed at the ancient Pole star, Thuban (Alpha Draconis) in the constellation ofthe Dragon—associated by the Pharaohs with notions of ‘cosmic pregnancy andgestation’. The southern shaft, which is angled at 45 degrees 14’, was aimed atAl Nitak (Zeta Orionis), the brightest (and also the lowest) of the three starsof Orion’s belt—which the ancient Egyptians identified with Osiris, their highgod of resurrection and rebirth and the legendary bringer of civilization to theNile Valley in a remote epoch referred to as Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’.[115][index_split_036.html#filepos786263]Because we can reconstruct the ancient skies over Giza with modern computers wecan demonstrate the spot-on alignments of the four shafts to the four starscirca 2500 BC. What the same computers also show us is that these alignmentswere rare and fleeting, only valid for a century or so, before the continuousgradual change effected in stellar altitudes by the passage of time altered thepositions at which the stars transited the meridian.This phenomenon, the result of a slow and stately wobble in the axis of theearth, is known technically as precession. Over a cycle of 25,920 years itcauses the infinitely-extended north pole of our planet’s spin axis to trace outa great circle in the heavens. The main astronomical effects of this motion are:1. an equally slow and stately change in the celestial north pole—whichsometimes coincides with a ‘pole star’ (and sometimes with empty space) as itprogresses eternally around its 25,920-year cycle;2. changes in the altitude of all stars above the horizon as they crossthe observer’s meridian at any given latitude;3. changes in the constellations against the background of which the sunrises due east at dawn on the spring equinox (naturally precession also changesthe constellations that mark the autumnal equinox—and the winter and summersolstices as well).The rate of precessional change is constant and predictable for each of thesekey astronomical effects and can be calculated backwards and forwards in timeacross the entire star-field. This means, for example, that if we were toobserve a specific bright star—say Al Nitak in Orion’s belt—from a given placetoday, and if we were to record its altitude at the meridian, then provided sucha record was to be found and understood thousands of years hence it could beused to determine the epoch or ‘time’ when the original observation was made.The same logic can be applied to the four meridional shafts emanating from theKing’s and Queen’s Chambers. Their alignments at 2500 BC—on four stars that wereof ritual importance within the ‘Osiris cycle’ of beliefs—cannot possibly havebeen accidental. On the contrary, it is obvious that we are confronted here bythe products of a conscious and careful design. This in turn makes it equallyobvious that the Great Pyramid must have some extremely strong connection withthe epoch of 2500 BC—the approximate date at which all orthodox Egyptologistsand archaeologists in fact believe it to have been built.In short, the four star-shafts serve as precise time-markers by which, in theoryat least, we should be able once and for all to confirm the date for theconstruction of the last-surviving wonder of the ancient world. This would behighly desirable since, in the absence of other objective means of dating themonument, controversy continues to linger over its exact age. However, thearchaeoastronomical picture is rather more complicated than it seems.The Companions of OsirisThe complication arises from the strong correlation, first demonstrated in TheOrion Mystery, between the three belt stars of the Orion constellation and theground-plan of the three Pyramids of Giza. An overhead view shows that the GreatPyramid and the second Pyramid stretch out along a diagonal running 45 degreesto the south and west of the former’s eastern face. The third Pyramid, however,is offset somewhat to the east of this line. The resulting pattern mimics thesky where the three stars of Orion’s belt also stretch out along a ‘faulty’diagonal. The first two stars (AI Nitak and Al Nilam) are in direct alignment,like the first and second Pyramids, and the third star (Mintaka) lies offsetsomewhat to the east of the axis formed by the other two.[116][index_split_036.html#filepos786349]The visual correlation, once observed, is obvious and striking on its own.Additional confirmation of its symbolic significance, however, is provided bythe Milky Way, which the ancient Egyptians regarded as a kind of ‘CelestialNile’ and which was spoken of in archaic funerary texts as the ‘WindingWaterway’.[117] [index_split_036.html#filepos786450] In the heavenly vault thebelt stars of Orion lie to the west of the Milky Way, as though overlooking itsbanks; on the ground the Pyramids stand perched above the west bank of theNile.[118] [index_split_036.html#filepos786536]Faced by such symmetry, and by such a complex pattern of interlockingarchitectural and religious ideas, it is hard to resist the conclusion that thePyramids of Giza represent a successful attempt to build Orion’s belt on theground. This makes all the more sense when we recall the firm identification ofthe Orion constellation with the high god Osiris.But bearing in mind the changes induced by the phenomenon of precession we mustalso ask: ‘Orion’s belt when?’ ‘Orion’s belt in what epoch?’A perfect matchFrom the evidence of the shafts we have seen how the Great Pyramid is‘precessionally anchored’ to Orion’s belt in 2500 BC (because in this epoch thesouthern shaft of the King’s Chamber targeted the meridian-transit of Al Nitak,the Great Pyramid’s celestial counterpart). If we set our precessional computerto reconstruct the ancient skies over Giza, however, turn our attention to thepattern formed on the ground by all three of the Pyramids in 2500 BC, simulatethe nightly passage of the belt stars across the roof of the celestial sphereand bring them to rest at the point of Al Nitak’s meridian-transit (45 degreesabove the southern horizon, where it is targeted by the King’s Chamber shaft),it becomes apparent that something is not quite right.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image023.jpg]23. Orion’s belt crossing the meridian of the Great Pyramid in 2500 BC with thestar Al Nitak, the Great Pyramid’s celestial counterpart, in perfect alignmentwith the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber at an altitude of 45 degrees.However, note how the belt stars and the Milky Way appear out of kilter andaskew in relation to the ground plan of the three Pyramids and the Nile. Thesky-ground images are, of course, similar, but there is a sense that the skyimage needs somehow to be ‘twisted’ in an anti-clockwise direction to get theperfect match. This can only be achieved by going back in time—by looking at thesky above Giza in a far earlier epoch ...[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image024.jpg]24. The perfect match of sky-ground images is achieved in 10,500 BC when thepattern of the Milky Way and of the three stars of Orion’s belt at meridiantransit is precisely matched by the course of the Nile and the pattern of thethree great Pyramids on the ground.We should expect to see a perfect meridian-to-meridian alignment at this point.Instead we notice that the dominant axis of the three stars and the Milky Waylies tilted conspicuously askew relative to the dominant axis of the threePyramids and the Nile. These latter, of course, are fixed in their places. Whatis required, therefore, in order to achieve the ‘ideal’ sky-ground arrangement,is somehow to ‘rotate’ the heavens in an anticlockwise direction.The vast cosmic engine of the earth’s axial wobble offers us a mechanism bywhich this can be done: we need only instruct our computer to track theprecessionally induced movements of the stars backwards in time.As it does so, millennium by millennium, we observe that the orientation ofOrion’s belt at culmination is slowly rotating anti-clockwise and thusapproaching ever closer to our desired meridian-to-meridian match. It is notuntil 10,500 BC, however—8000 years before the ‘Pyramid Age’—that the perfectcorrelation is finally achieved with the Nile mirroring the Milky Way and withthe three Pyramids and the belt stars identically disposed in relation to themeridian.[119] [index_split_036.html#filepos786622]Rising starsThere is a feature of this 10,500 BC correlation which suggests strongly thatcoincidence is not involved. The pattern that is frozen into monumentalarchitecture in the form of the Pyramids marks a very significant moment in the25,920-year precessional cycle of the three stars of Orion’s belt—one that isunlikely to have been randomly selected by the Pyramid builders.To get a clear grasp of what is involved here let us call up a computersimulation of the skies over Giza in our own epoch, circa AD 2000. Looking duesouth we note that Al Nitak crosses the meridian at an altitude of 58 degrees06’ above the horizon. This, as it happens, is within 8 minutes of the highestaltitude that this star will attain in its precessional cycle, i.e. 58 degrees14’ (to be reached at around AD 2500).[120] [index_split_036.html#filepos786721]Let us now project our simulation backwards in time and recreate the sky as wewould see it if we were standing in the same position at around 10,500 BC—i.e.just under 13,000 years, or half a precessional cycle, earlier. In this remoteepoch we discover that Al Nitak crosses the meridian at an altitude of only 9degrees 20’ above the horizon.[121] [index_split_036.html#filepos786849][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image025.jpg]25. By mimicking the sky pattern of Orion’s belt in 10,500 BC the three greatPyramids of Giza mark a very significant moment in the 20,000-year precessionalcycle of these stars—the lowest point in their slide up and down the meridian,when (as seen from the latitude of Giza) they culminated at an altitude of 9degrees 20 minutes above the horizon (C). In 2500 BC they culminated at altitude45 degrees (B). In our own epoch, 2000 AD (A) they are approaching the highestaltitude that they will attain in their precessional cycle—58 degrees 06 minutesabove the horizon at meridian transit.It will never fall lower, the epoch of 10,500 BC marks the nadir of the star’sprecessionally induced slide up and down the meridian (just as the epoch of AD2500 marks its zenith). Like a slowly moving lever in a narrow vertical slot, ittakes 12,960 years to descend from top to bottom, and a further 12,960 years toascend from bottom to top again.[122] [index_split_036.html#filepos787270]By exactly mimicking the disposition of the belt stars in the sky in 10,500 BCthe layout of the Pyramids on the ground thus not only signifies a specificepoch but also rather precisely and surgically marks the beginning of aprecessional half-cycle.Lion on the ground, lion in the skyAs was pointed out in Fingerprints, of the Gods, the same role is played by theGreat Sphinx—which gazes directly at the equinoctial rising point of the sun inany and every epoch, past, present and future, for ever.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image026.jpg]26.

The rising points and trajectory of Orion’s belt in (A) 2000 AD, (B) 2500BC, (C) 10,500 BC.This orientation provides us with an astronomical basis for dating the monumentbecause it is known that the attention of astronomers in ancient times wasparticularly focused on the zodiacal constellation—considered to define theastrological ‘Age’—that rose just ahead of the sun in the eastern sky at dawn onthe spring equinox.[123] [index_split_036.html#filepos787400] The samephenomenon of the earth’s axial precession that affects the altitude of stars atthe meridian also affects these famous constellations—Leo, Cancer, Gemini,Taurus, Aries, Pisces, Aquarius, etc., etc—the co-ordinates of which, inrelation to the rising point of the equinoctial sun, undergo slow but continuousprecessionally induced changes. The result is a hard-to-observe astronomicalphenomenon, known as the precession of the equinoxes, which manifests as agradual circulation of the equinoctial point around all twelve ‘houses’ of thezodiac. In the words of historians of science Giorgio de Santillana and Herthavon Dechend, whose essay Hamlet’s Mill is a ground-breaking study of archaicprecessional mythology:The constellation that rose in the east just before the sun (that is, roseheliacally) marked the ‘place’ where the sun rested ... It was known as thesun’s ‘carrier’, and as the main ‘pillar’ of the sky. ... The sun’s positionamong the constellations at the vernal [spring] equinox was the pointer thatindicated the ‘hours’ of the precessional cycle—very long hours indeed, theequinoctial sun occupying each zodiacal constellation for just under 2200years.[124] [index_split_036.html#filepos787602]In our own epoch the sun on the spring equinox rises against the stellarbackground of the constellation of Pisces, as it has done for approximately thelast 2000 years. The ‘Age of Pisces’, however, is now approaching its end andthe vernal sun will soon pass out of the sector of the Fishes and begin to riseagainst the new background of Aquarius. To be precise, it takes exactly 2160years for the equinoctial point to pass completely through one constellation or‘house’ of the zodiac.With this process in mind, let us now reverse Santillana and von Dechend’s‘precessional clock’. Passing back through the Age of Pisces (and the Age ofAries that preceded it) we find that in the epoch of 2500 BC, when the Sphinx isconventionally assumed to have been built, it was the constellation of Taurusthat housed the sun on the spring equinox.It is here that the crux of the problem lies. To state the case briefly:1. The Sphinx, as we have seen, is an equinoctial marker—or ‘pointer’.2. On a site that is as profoundly astronomical as Giza one wouldnaturally expect an equinoctial monument dating from the ‘Age of Taurus’ eitherto have been built in the shape of a bull, or at any rate to symbolize a bull.The Sphinx, however, is emphatically leonine in form.3. It is a simple fact of precession that one must go back to the ‘Age ofLeo’ beginning at around 10,500 BC, in order to obtain the ‘correct’ sky-groundsymbolism. This, as it turns out, is the only epoch in which the due-east-facingSphinx would have manifested exactly the right symbolic alignment on exactly theright day—watching the vernal sun rising in the dawn sky against the backgroundof his own celestial counterpart.[125] [index_split_036.html#filepos787696]To clarify this latter notion, let us return to our computer simulation of theskies over Giza in 10,500 BC, instructing the program to recreate the positionsof the sun and stars just before dawn on the spring equinox in that epoch. Andlet us set our direction of view due east in line with the gaze of the Sphinx.Indeed, with the aid of a little virtual reality and poetic license, let usimagine that we are standing between the paws of the Sphinx itself at thatdate—a date that we already know accords rather well with the geology of themonument.What we would see, occupying the portion of the sky into which the sun is aboutto rise, would be the splendid zodiacal constellation of Leo—a constellationthat very strongly resembles its namesake the lion and thus also the leonineSphinx.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image028.jpg]28. In the pre-dawn on the vernal equinox in 10,500 BC, with the sun some 12degrees below the horizon, the Great Sphinx would have gazed directly at his owncelestial counterpart, the constellation of Leo—which experienced whatastronomers call its heliacal rising at this moment.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image029.jpg]29. Superimposed images of the rising of Leo in 2500 BC, when the Great Sphinxis presumed by archaeologists to have been built, and in 10,500 BC. It is onlyin this latter epoch that the perfect sky-ground correlation is attained, at theheliacal rising of Leo, when the Sphinx would have gazed directly at his owncelestial counterpart in the pre-dawn.The minutes pass. The sky begins to lighten. Then, at the exact moment at whichthe top of the solar disc breaks over the horizon directly ahead of us we make a90-degree right turn—so that we are now looking due south. There, culminating atthe meridian at altitude 9 degrees 20’, we observe the three stars of Orion’sbelt forming a pattern in the sky that is identical to the ground plan of theGiza Pyramids.The question reduces to this: is it a coincidence, or more than a coincidence,that the Giza necropolis as it has reached us today out of the darkness ofantiquity is still dominated by a huge equinoctial lion statue at the east ofits ‘horizon’ and by three gigantic Pyramids disposed about its meridian in thedistinctive manner of the three stars of Orion’s belt in 10,500 BC?[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image030.jpg]30. The moment of sunrise on the vernal equinox in 10,500 BC. At the exactmoment that the top of the solar disc broke over the horizon due east in directalignment with the gaze of the Sphinx the three stars of Orion’s belt culminatedat the meridian in the pattern that is mimicked on the ground by the three greatPyramids. Sphinx and Pyramids thus appear to ‘work together’ as an architecturalrepresentation of this unique celestial conjunction.And is it also a coincidence that the monuments in this amazing astronomicaltheme park manage to work together—almost as though geared like the cog-wheelsof a clock—to tell the same ‘time’?Throughout the ancient world the moment of sunrise, and its conjunction withother celestial events, was always considered to be of great importance.[126][index_split_036.html#filepos787834] At the spring equinox in 10,500 BC, asshould by now be obvious, a particularly spectacular and statisticallyimprobable conjunction took place—a conjunction involving the moment of sunrise,the constellation of Leo and the meridian transit of the three stars of Orion’sbelt. It is this unique celestial conjunction (which furthermore marks thebeginning of the ‘Age of Leo’ and the beginning of the upwards precessionalcycle of the belt stars) that the Great Sphinx and the three Pyramids of Gizaappear to model.But why should the ancients have sought to create a simulacrum of the skies onthe ground at Giza?Or, to put the question another way, why should they have sought to bring downto earth an image of the heavens?Motive in the textsThere exists an ancient body of writings, compiled in Greek in the Egyptian cityof Alexandria in the early centuries of the Christian era, in which sky-grounddualisms form a predominant theme, linked in numerous convoluted ways to theissue of the resurrection and immortality of the soul. These writings, the‘Hermetic Texts’, were believed to have been the work of the ancient Egyptianwisdom god Thoth (known to the Greeks as Hermes), who in one representativepassage makes the following remarks to his disciple Asclepius: ‘Do you not know,Asclepius, that Egypt is an image of heaven? Or, so to speak more exactly, inEgypt all the operations of the powers which rule and work in heaven have beentransferred down to earth below?’[127] [index_split_036.html#filepos788013] Thepurpose to which these powers were harnessed, in the Hermetic view, was tofacilitate the initiate’s quest for immortality.Curiously, precisely such a quest for precisely such a goal—‘a life of millionsof years’—is spelled out in ancient Egyptian funerary texts which supposedlypre-date the Hermetic writings by thousands of years. In one of these texts,Shat Ent Am Duat—the Book of What is in the Duat—we find what appears to be anexplicit instruction to the initiate to build a replica on the ground of aspecial area of the sky known as the ‘hidden circle of the Duat’: ‘Whosoevershall make an exact copy of these forms ... and shall know it, shall be a spiritand well equipped both in heaven and earth, unfailingly, and regularly andeternally.’[128] [index_split_036.html#filepos788200]Elsewhere in the same text we hear again of ‘the hidden Circle in the Duat ...in the body of Nut [the sky]’: ‘Whosoever shall make a copy thereof ... it shallact as a magical protector for him both in heaven and upon earth.’[129][index_split_036.html#filepos788489]We suspect that the ideas expressed in such utterances may hint at the truemotive for the construction of the huge astronomical monuments of the Gizanecropolis and may help us to find a coherent explanation for their precisealignments to the cardinal directions of the sky, their unique ‘star shafts’,and their intense celestial symbolism. At any rate, as we shall demonstrate inParts III and IV, it is a fact that the Duat sky-region described in the ancientEgyptian texts was dominated by the constellations of Orion and Leo—both ofwhich appear to have been ‘imaged’ on the ground at Giza (with the formeradditionally targeted by the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber in the GreatPyramid)—and by the star Sirius, which was targeted by the southern shaft of theQueen’s Chamber. We also note in passing that the internal corridor, passagewayand chamber systems of the Pyramids very closely resemble surviving vignettes(painted on Eighteenth Dynasty tomb walls) of various regions of the Duat. Ofparticular interest in this regard is the mysterious ‘Kingdom of Sokar’ in the‘Fifth Division of the Duat in which ‘travellers upon the way of the holycountry ... enter into the hidden place of the Duat.’[130][index_split_036.html#filepos788625]As we shall also see in Parts III and IV, there are the repeated references inthe Book of What is in the Duat, and in numerous other funerary and rebirthtexts, to Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’—the remote epoch when the gods werebelieved to have come to earth and established their kingdom in Egypt.[131][index_split_036.html#filepos788719] Those gods included Thoth-Hermes, the‘Thrice-Great’ master of wisdom, the goddess Isis whose celestial counterpartwas the star Sirius, and Osiris, the ‘once and future king’, who was killed,revenged by his son Horus, and then reborn to live for ever as the ‘Lord of theDuat’.[132] [index_split_036.html#filepos788921][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image031.jpg]31.

The celestial counterpart of Osiris was Orion, a constellation that theancient Egyptians knew as Sah, the ‘Far Strider’, and depicted (as in thecentral register of this vignette from the tomb of an ancient Egyptian architectnamed Senmut) by means of the three characteristic belt stars.The celestial counterpart of Osiris was Orion—a constellation that the ancientEgyptians knew as Sah, the ‘Far-Strider’ and most frequently depicted by meansof the three characterstic belt stars. And since Osiris was said to have ruledin the ‘First Time’ we wonder whether this could be the reason why the threegreat Pyramids of Giza depict the three stars of Orion’s belt as they looked12,500 years ago at what might reasonably be defined as their astronomical‘First Time’—i.e. at the beginning of their current upwards precessional cycle?An even bigger question, upon which much of our investigation hinges, concernsthe identification of the Sphinx with the constellation of Leo—and specificallywith the constellation of Leo when it marked the spring equinox in 10,500 BC. InParts III and IV we will follow astronomical clues, laid out in the ancientEgyptian texts, which strongly support this identification and which offerintriguing hints as to its implications.Fundamental questionsIf the monuments of the Giza necropolis were of no significance in the humanstory then problems in the study and interpretation of these monuments would beof no significance either. But this site could hardly be more significant.Indeed, there is a sense in which it has always been with us. It is a marker ofour history—a memorial to the genesis of our civilization—and it may still havevital information to give us about ourselves. More than any other ancient place,in other words, Giza raises, and might possibly answer, all the old, fundamentalquestions: who we are, where we came from, perhaps even where we are going. Forthese reasons we can hardly afford to be indifferent to the Great Sphinx and thethree great Pyramids. For these reasons the quality of research that has beencarried out around them—and that has defined and explained them—really doesmatter.As we shall see in Part II this research has become strangely tangled up with anancient tradition of quest for hidden chambers and lost records at Giza ..."},{"pageContent":"Part IISeekers"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5> > The Case of the Psychic,> > the Scholar and the Sphinx‘There has been one systematic search, a sort of direct shot at finding the Hallof Records, when the Edgar Cayce Foundation funded SRI International ...’Dr. Mark Lehner, Edgar Cayce Foundation and ARE Magazine Venture Inward, 1985There is a tradition which asserts that the Giza monuments stand as a last andgrand memorial to a highly advanced antediluvian civilization that was destroyedby a ‘Great Flood’. This tradition also holds that somewhere at Giza, eitherbeneath the Great Sphinx or within the Great Pyramid itself, is concealed a‘Hall of Records’ in which is preserved the entire knowledge and wisdom of thelost civilization.Such ideas may be of very archaic origin[133][index_split_036.html#filepos789111] and have continued throughout history toinspire investigations at Giza. In the fourth century AD, for example, the RomanAmmianus Marcellinus directed treasure-hunters to search for ‘certainunderground galleries in the Pyramids’, constructed as repositories for scrollsand books of past ages and intended ‘to prevent the ancient wisdom from beinglost in the Flood.’[134] [index_split_036.html#filepos790293]Likewise, many of the Arab chroniclers from about the ninth century AD onwardsseem to have had access to a common source of information which caused them toagree that the Great Pyramid was built ‘before the Flood’ as a repository forscientific knowledge. Caliph Al Mamoun, who forced a tunnel into the northernface of the monument in AD 820, did so out of a conviction that he was enteringa relic from antediluvian times which had been charged by its maker with thesecrets of ‘all profound science’, which could ‘convey knowledge of both historyand astronomy’,[135] [index_split_036.html#filepos790458] and which would befound to contain ‘a secret chamber with maps and terrestrial spheres’.[136][index_split_036.html#filepos790802]In a similar vein, a number of ancient Egyptian inscriptions and papyri maketantalizing statements about hidden chambers—the Chamber of Archives, the Hallof Records, etc., etc.—which have been interpreted as references to a hypogeumbeneath or close by the Sphinx.[137] [index_split_036.html#filepos790959] AndCoptic legends report that ‘there exists a single subterranean chamber under theSphinx with entrances to all three Pyramids ... Each entrance is guarded bystatues of amazing abilities.’[138] [index_split_036.html#filepos791701]In modern times, ideas such as these have been kept very much alive in thedoctrines of speculative Freemasonry[139] [index_split_036.html#filepos791944]and in the teachings of esoteric schools like the AMORC Rosicrucians ofCalifornia and the Theosophical Society of London and Madras. In addition, fromthe 1920s to the 1940s, almost identical notions were expressed with curiousvehemence by the American psychic Edgar Cayce, known to some as the ‘SleepingProphet’.Since an examination of ‘psychic intuitions’ would take us far beyond theintended scope of this book we shall offer no opinions on the merits or thesources of Cayce’s information. What we do find relevant to our investigation,however, is that his pronouncements concerning a supposed Atlantean ‘Hall ofRecords’ at Giza have quietly spawned a multimillion-dollar New Age industrythat has embroiled itself deeply with mainstream Egyptological research into thePyramids and the Sphinx.We first learned about this unexpected involvement—unexpected because psychicsand Egyptologists are normally about as hard to mix as chickens andpolecats—when reviewing the numerous studies and excavations undertaken at Gizaby the American Egyptologist, Mark Lehner. As the reader will recall from PartI, Professor Lehner has gone on record several times during the 1990s to opposethe theory of a 12,500-year-old Sphinx—and any notion of a Hall of Recordsbeneath it. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, he was directly involved withthe followers of Edgar Cayce and with their distinctive beliefs about thesecrets and mysteries of Giza.Trancing the Hall of RecordsThe management of the Edgar Cayce ‘industry’ is largely entrusted to acorporation known as the Edgar Cayce Foundation (ECF), and to the affiliatedAssociation for Research and Enlightenment (ARE), both of which areheadquartered in the US coastal town of Virginia Beach. The first impressionthat most visitors get on arrival here is of a sort of medical clinic orretirement home located with a calming view of the ocean in mind. The windows ofthe principal building, which are made of opaque glass, are a littledisconcerting. But reassurance is provided by a large black-and-white sign,visible from the parking lot, which reads:A.R.E.EDGAR CAYCE FOUNDATIONAtlantic University Visitor CenterSchool of MassageBookstoreEdgar Cayce was born in Hopkinsville in Kentucky in 1877. At the age of twentyhe suffered from a speech impediment. After fruitless attempts to have itdiagnosed by local doctors, he discovered that he could put himself into a deeptrance and somehow diagnose the disorder and dictate a remedy. Cayce was urgedto try his technique on others—with results that were so spectacularlysuccessful that within months he had gained an immense reputation as a ‘healer’with the gift of inner vision. All sorts of desperate people flocked to VirginiaBeach to be diagnosed by the ‘Sleeping Prophet’.In his trances Cayce would also give psychic ‘readings’ to his enthusiasticfollowers—readings that were taken down in shorthand by a secretary.[140][index_split_036.html#filepos792873] Cayce would always claim to have absolutelyno recollection of what happened during these trances, but the ‘readings’ showthat he frequently spoke to his followers about their ‘past lives’ in a remoteepoch—the epoch of ‘Atlantis’, before and after the terrible deluge whichsupposedly destroyed that fabled continent. Altogether some 700 of Cayce’s ‘lifereadings’—now available on CD-ROM—expound in one way or another on the so-called‘Atlantean’ story which begins with ‘humankind’s arrival on earth some tenmillion years ago, and ends with the sinking of the last remnants of Atlantis[prior to] 10,000 BC’.[141] [index_split_036.html#filepos793252]The essential message of these readings is that a number of ‘Atlanteans’ escapedthe destruction of their continent and somehow reached the Nile Valley in Egyptin the eleventh millennium BC. Cayce himself claimed to be the reincarnation oftheir high priest Ra-Ta. According to Dr. Douglas G. Richards, director andresearcher at the Atlantic University (which is part of the Edgar CayceFoundation): ‘many who received life readings [from Cayce] were said to havebeen associated with him in this past life’ in prehistoric Egypt.[142][index_split_036.html#filepos793525]One of the most persistent accounts given by Edgar Cayce during his deep trancesconcerned:References and clues [which] indicate Egypt as a repository for records—recordsof Atlantis and ancient Egypt during the time of Ra-Ta, which may some day befound. They also mention again and again tombs and pyramids yet to be uncoveredin Egypt, and give specific dates for the building of the Great Pyramid.[143][index_split_036.html#filepos793755]The chronology that Cayce gave for this latter enterprise was ‘10,490 to 10,390BC’.[144] [index_split_036.html#filepos793849] He also stated: ‘... some 10,500[years] before the coming of the Christ ... there was first that attempt torestore and add to that which had been begun and what is called the Sphinx ...’Also at around 10,500 BC the Cayce readings state that a vast undergroundrepository was established containing a library of wisdom from the lostcivilization of Atlantis: ‘This in position lies, as the sun rises from thewaters, the line of shadow (or light) falls between the paws of the Sphinx ...Between, then, the Sphinx and the river ...’[145][index_split_036.html#filepos794103] In another reading Cayce gave even morespecific directions: ‘There is a chamber or passage from the right forepaw [ofthe Sphinx] to this entrance of the record chamber ...’[146][index_split_036.html#filepos794329]According to the readings, the Hall of Records is to be rediscovered andre-entered when ‘the time has been fulfilled’—which, Cayce suggested, would beat or just before the close of the twentieth century, perhaps in 1998.[147][index_split_036.html#filepos794483] The readings allude frequently to the Oldand New Testaments of the Bible, contain numerous references to Jesus, anddepict the rediscovery of the Hall of Records as being linked in some way to aseries of events that will prelude the ‘Second Coming’ of Christ.[148][index_split_036.html#filepos794781]The ScholarThe corporate history of the Association for Research and Enlightenment (ARE)begins in 1931, when the management of the newly founded institute was entrustedto Edgar Cayce’s eldest son, Hugh Lynn Cayce—who had just majored in psychology.His first task was to provide a repository for his father’s growing library ofpsychic ‘readings’, a sort of modern ‘Hall of Records’ in Virginia Beach. Thistask was eventually completed after Edgar Cayce’s death in 1945. Meanwhile theARE continued to expand and today has flourished into a multimillion-dollarorganization with over 40,000 members world-wide. Unsurprisingly, however,despite a diversity of interests, its major thrust continues to be to prove thevalidity of the Edgar Cayce readings. What this involves in practice is aconcerted attempt to find the so-called ‘Hall of Records’ of Atlantis which, aswe have seen, is believed to have been preserved at Giza since 10,500 BC underthe Sphinx and which, as the prophet said, would be opened before the year 2000.As two of Cayce’s own children recently confirmed:Over twenty years ago the ECF began to lay the groundwork for what would laterbecome actual field work in Egypt. The specific areas of interest were theSphinx, the Great Pyramid, and the immediate surrounding area known as the Gizaplateau. The driving force for this research was Hugh Lynn Cayce. Motivated byhis father’s psychic readings, as well as a personal interest in archaeology, heturned his energies and enthusiasm to initiating solid archaeological researchthat might validate them ...[149] [index_split_036.html#filepos794998]In 1973 Hugh Lynn managed to round up a group of sponsors who were ready tofinance a long-term strategy in Egypt. First and foremost this entailedproviding an ‘academic scholarship ... plus a small stipend’ to a ‘giftedindividual’ who could become a respected Egyptologist and gain the confidence ofthe leading lights of this stern profession.[150][index_split_036.html#filepos795151]The ‘gifted individual’ chosen to receive the stipend was Mark Lehner,[151][index_split_036.html#filepos795245] until 1995 a Professor of Egyptology at theUniversity of Chicago’s world-famous Oriental Institute. Often referred to inEdgar Cayce literature as ‘the scholar’, it appears that some time in 1973Lehner was earmarked by Hugh Lynn Cayce for a mission in Egypt which wasenvisaged as follows:The scholar could complete a degree in Cairo and gain first-hand experience andmake contacts in his field. For the ECF [Edgar Cayce Foundation], such supportcould create a realistic perspective on research efforts in Egypt, producecontacts, and lead eventually to research involvement in this area. Although thescholar would be independent of the ECF, his presence in Egypt would serve as aneffective liaison or channel for the ECF to develop long-term involvementthere.[152] [index_split_036.html#filepos796204]Lehner arrived in Cairo in the fall of 1973 and studied at the AmericanUniversity near Al Tahrir Square—from whence he graduated in 1975 with highhonours:After graduation the Edgar Cayce Foundation supported him as a research fellowfor several years in the department of anthropology. During this time, thestudent not only continued his academic studies, but also made contacts withpeople and organizations well known for their research. These contacts made itpossible for the ECF to sponsor—directly in some cases, and partially inothers—actual field research.[153] [index_split_036.html#filepos796682]Proof under the pawsIn 1974 Lehner published a book, The Egyptian Heritage, which is copyrighted tothe Edgar Cayce Foundation and which bears the subtitle ‘Based on the EdgarCayce Readings’. Its prime objective is to substantiate Cayce’s statements aboutthe supposed ‘Atlantean connection’ in the prehistory of Egypt and the ‘Hall ofRecords’ established at Giza in 10,500 BC:According to the [Edgar Cayce} readings, it is a legacy which will soon berediscovered, and will bear profound determinations—not only for the history ofdynastic Egypt, but for the entire physical and spiritual epic of our evolutionon this planet, and for the years yet to pass.[154][index_split_036.html#filepos796823]In The Egyptian Heritage Lehner also informs us that:There are 1159 Edgar Cayce readings which contain references and information onthe Ra-Ta period in Egypt. The story presented here has been culled fromapproximately 300 of these readings ... In presenting correlative Egyptologicaldata I will attempt to demonstrate that there are good empirical reasons forbelieving that the Ra-Ta story is, in fact, rooted in truth. Of course, thefinal confirmation lies beneath the paws of the Sphinx at Giza ...[155][index_split_036.html#filepos796973]AnomaliesNaturally the prime area of interest of the ECF/ARE in terms of ‘actual fieldresearch’ was—and remains—scanning, drilling and excavation in the vicinity ofthe Sphinx where the Cayce readings say that the ‘Hall of Records’ is located.In 1973-4, while Mark Lehner was still a student at the American University inCairo, the first in a series of serious pioneering projects was launched, usingground-penetrating radar and other high-tech remote sensing equipment to locate‘anomalies’ under the bedrock beneath the Sphinx. These projects were channelledthrough well-established academic institutions—the Ain Shams University in Cairoand the prestigious Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the USA.[156][index_split_036.html#filepos797066]In 1977 the US National Science Foundation funded a project at Giza againinvolving the SRI. This time use was made of several new techniques such asresistivity measurements (from metal rods driven into the rock across which anelectric current was passed), magnetometry, and also the latest aerialphotography and thermal infrared image-enhancing techniques. According to theSRI team’s official report: ‘Several anomalies were observed as a result of ourresistivity survey at the Sphinx ... Behind the rear paws (north-west end) weran two traverses. Both traverses indicate an anomaly that could possibly be dueto a tunnel aligned north-west to south-east ...’[157][index_split_036.html#filepos797815]Two other ‘anomalies’ were noted, deep in the bedrock ‘in front of the paws ofthe Sphinx’.[158] [index_split_036.html#filepos798046]According to ECF/ARE historians the 1973-4 and 1977 projects ‘paved the way forwork ... that would succeed in discovering hidden chambers’.[159][index_split_036.html#filepos798299] Exactly how and where is not made clear. Atany rate in 1978 the ECF/ARE collaborated with the SRI and provided funds (tothe tune of about US$50,000[160] [index_split_036.html#filepos798440]) for amore detailed survey of the Sphinx enclosure and the nearby Sphinx Temple. Thesurvey was recorded in the SRI’s own records as ‘The Sphinx ExplorationProject’. It entailed an extensive resistivity scan of the entire floor of theSphinx and Sphinx Temple enclosures. Should any ‘anomalies’ be found, it wasagreed that the SRI was to confirm them with acoustic sounding techniques. Thenext step was to have holes cut into the bedrock with precision drills throughwhich borescope cameras could then be inserted.Several anomalies beneath the bedrock were indeed identified and inspected inthis way but proved to be just natural cavities.A falling outAlso in 1978, US drilling experts from a company called Recovery SystemsInternational (RSI) arrived at Giza with a telescopic diesel-powered drill andofficial permits, under the direction of an American named Kent Wakefield, tobore a number of holes deep beneath the Sphinx.[161][index_split_036.html#filepos798575] There was more of a connection between theSRI and the RSI than the anagram formed by their initials. Recovery SystemsInternational, like the Edgar Cayce Foundation, apparently funded some of theSRI’s programme at Giza, and made use of the SRI’s resistivity readings to guidethe placement of their drill holes. According to Mark Lehner, who was there atthe time, Recovery Systems International was probably organized ‘just for thisproject’.[162] [index_split_036.html#filepos798889]The equipment for RSI’s work was air-freighted to Egypt and brought to the sitewhere it was positioned in the Sphinx Temple, directly in front of the paws ofthe Sphinx itself. One hole was bored, uneventfully. A second hole was thendrilled. Mark Lehner and Kent Wakefield examined this hole with a borescope andsaw only ‘Swiss-cheese-like solution cavities’ which form naturally inlimestone. The solid bottom of the hole was tapped with a plumb-bob by Lehnerwho concluded that there was nothing unusual about it.[163][index_split_036.html#filepos799022]Immediately afterwards the project was stopped. According to Mark Lehner thisabrupt halt was ‘due to lack of time [and] funds’.[164][index_split_036.html#filepos799108] Also it seems that Recovery SystemsInternational ‘did not appreciate at all the Cayce component of the project’ andthat this eventually led to a ‘serious falling out between RSI and SRI’.[165][index_split_036.html#filepos799194]Granite structuresShortly after this episode, in 1979, as we shall see in further detail below,Mark Lehner got involved with the American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE forshort)—which is the officially registered American Egyptological mission inEgypt.[166] [index_split_036.html#filepos799280] At about the same time, ZahiHawass, today the Director-General of the Giza Pyramids, was supervisingexcavations 165 feet to the east of the Sphinx Temple and hit bedrock at a depthof only six feet. A few months later, however—in 1980—Egyptian irrigationspecialists checking for groundwater drilled in the same area, less than 100feet away from the Hawass dig, and were able to go down more than 50 feetwithout impediment before their drill-bit suddenly collided with something hardand massive. After freeing the drill, much to their surprise, they found thatthey had brought to the surface a large lump of Aswan granite.[167][index_split_036.html#filepos799463]No granite occurs naturally anywhere in the Nile Delta area where Giza islocated, and Aswan—the source of all the granite used by the ancients at Giza—islocated 500 miles to the south. The discovery of what appears to be asubstantial granite obstacle—or perhaps several obstacles—50 feet below groundlevel in the vicinity of the Sphinx is therefore intriguing to say the least.Adding to the intrigue were further discoveries that the SRI made around theSphinx in 1982 as a result of yet another project financed by the Edgar CayceFoundation.[168] [index_split_036.html#filepos799707] Mark Lehner, who was onceagain present throughout, described what the SRI did as follows:They brought a very powerful acoustical sounder, which is a long pencil-shapedthing. They put it down a drill hole. This is called Immersion DownholeAcoustics. You have to be in water. So they put it down into the water table andit sent out sound waves in all directions. Then they put down a listener, like astethoscope, and you get a signal on an oscilloscope if sound waves are comingthrough; if they’re not, you don’t. You discover fissures this way—on one sideof the fissure there’s no signal and on the other side there is.They put the sounder underneath the paw [of the Sphinx] and always got a good,clear signal—there’s no underground cavity blocking it. And they put it alongthe paw between the elbow and that box on the side, around the outside of thebox and into the corner, and there was always a good signal.But, at my prompting, they put it on the bedrock floor inside the box—and it wasdead three places where they put it down, as though there is some kind ofopening or empty space underneath that was blocking the signal. That was thevery last day of the SRI project, and they never checked that out.[169][index_split_036.html#filepos799832]Since 1982, we were surprised to learn, almost no further research has beenofficially authorized to investigate the numerous tantalizing hints of deeplyburied structures and chambers in the vicinity of the Sphinx. The singleexception was Thomas Dobecki’s seismic work in the early 1990s. As reported inPart I, this resulted in the discovery of what appears to be a large,rectangular chamber beneath the forepaws of the Sphinx. Dobecki’s investigationswere part of the wider geological survey of the Sphinx led by Professor RobertSchoch of Boston University—a survey, as the reader will recall, that wasbrought abruptly to a halt in 1993 by Dr. Zahi Hawass of the EgyptianAntiquities Organization.The mapping surveysThe American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE) has several times received ECF-AREfinancing for its programme of investigations at Giza.[170][index_split_036.html#filepos799918] In 1979, for example, a proposal was madeto the ARCE for a full-scale mapping survey involving the Great Sphinx and itsenclosure in which use would be made of modern photogrammetric techniques torecord every detail, crack, fissure, contour and outline of the monument. Whenthe survey went ahead, Mark Lehner was appointed as its Field Director. Funderswere the Edgar Cayce Foundation, the Chase National Bank of Egypt and theFranzhein Synergy group.[171] [index_split_036.html#filepos801298]Mark Lehner completed the mapping survey in 1983 and by 1984 his reputation wassealed as America’s leading expert on the Sphinx. He was then appointed Directorof the newly established and much more extensive and ambitious Giza MappingProject, again under the auspices of the ARCE, and with somefunding—again—coming from the Edgar Cayce Foundation and ARE. The majorfinancial contributors were the Yale Endowment for Egyptology, General Dynamics,the multimillionaire David Koch, and a Los Angeles real-estate tycoon namedBruce Ludwig.[172] [index_split_036.html#filepos801439] More recently the GizaMapping Project has been superseded by the Giza Plateau Project which alsonumbers David Koch and Bruce Ludwig amongst its funders and which is alsodirected by Mark Lehner.[173] [index_split_036.html#filepos802260]Pulling awayWhen, exactly, Professor Lehner began to pull away from the influence of theEdgar Cayce Foundation and cross over into the mainstream of professionalEgyptology and its orthodoxy is not especially clear. However, some light may beshed on the matter by an interview that he gave in August 1984 to Robert Smith,editor of the ARE magazine Venture Inward. The interview was published in twoparts in the January-February issues of 1985. Asked about his work at Giza,Lehner explained:The history of my involvement began in 1972 when I went on an ARE tour. Westopped in Egypt for a week and I went out to the Giza plateau with a group, andthen I went out to the Giza Pyramids again by myself and sat for awhile in theKing’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid. I wandered around the cemeteries that areoutside the Pyramid, and something plugged into me about this place. I vowedthat I would be back in a year, and so I was. I went back to study at theAmerican University in Cairo. During that year before returning to Cairo, Ienthusiastically researched the Cayce readings on Egypt and put together thebook, The Egyptian Heritage. The readings describe not only a civilization inEgypt in 10,500 BC, but also, preceding that, the lost civilization of Atlantis,which was in its final days, according to the Cayce information, when the Sphinxand the Pyramids were built ...[174] [index_split_036.html#filepos802392]Lehner then explained how he had come to realize that ‘there’s a great disparitybetween the dating of the monuments by professional scholars and that given inthe Cayce readings’. He added that for him investigating the Sphinx was ‘just afocus of a general metaphysical and spiritual quest’. This had led him to work,he elaborated, ‘with the bedrock realities [and] ground truth’—realities thathad made him bracket all his expectations and ideas and ‘just deal with what thesite has to offer’.[175] [index_split_036.html#filepos802590]In Venture Inward magazine of May-June 1986, Robert Smith published anilluminating report about a meeting that took place at the Edgar CayceFoundation attended by Mark Lehner, Charles Thomas Cayce (President of the ARE),James C. Windsor (President of the Edgar Cayce Foundation), Edgar Evans Cayce,and other ARE officials. On the agenda was the evaluation of future ECF/AREactivities at Giza. Setbacks and mounting scientific evidence against the Cayceprophesies had caused some to question whether it was still worthwhile fundingprojects there. Ironically, much of the adverse evidence was being turned up byLehner’s research.[176] [index_split_036.html#filepos802683] Robert Smithrecounts the discussion that took place:‘What do we do next?’ asked Edgar Evans Cayce, the younger son of Edgar Cayceand a member of the Board of Trustees.‘Should we drill more holes?’ asked Charles Thomas Cayce, president of the ARE,and grandson of Edgar Cayce.Neither has given up the search for Ra-Ta. Lehner, the young archaeologist whohas led the search at Giza for the past decade, wants to press on with it too.‘You are not as optimistic now about the prospects of vindicating some of thethings that were said about this area in the readings,’ noted James C. Windsor,President of the Edgar Cayce Foundation. ‘Do you have any interest in the Hallof Records? Is it worth looking for?’‘Oh, absolutely,’ replied Lehner. ‘I think it is, but not in as tangible a wayas I used to think.’[177] [index_split_036.html#filepos803595]Lehner went on to explain at length why various archaeological and scientifictests had frustrated his hopes that the Cayce readings might be linked to asuitably ‘tangible’ reality. ‘Why then continue the search?’ wondered RobertSmith.‘I have a sort of gut feeling that something is under the Sphinx and thatsomething is out there at the pyramids in the way of a mystery,’ said Lehner. ‘Ilike to think of it as something kind of pulsating.’[178][index_split_036.html#filepos803720]During the meeting at the Edgar Cayce Foundation, Charles Thomas Caycereportedly asked Lehner whether it would be possible to drill holes at regularintervals in order to locate underground passages near the Sphinx, but Lehnerfelt that the Egyptians would ‘balk’ at this idea. He suggested in passing,however, that a certain American oil company official, who at that time wasapparently working for an American museum might be interested in using his‘crack geophysical prospecting team’ for explorations beneath the Sphinx.[179][index_split_036.html#filepos803814]Since making these statements and proposals—because, he says, of what the sitehas taught him—Lehner has veered further and further away from the Edgar Cayceinfluence. Today he repudiates any notion of an earlier civilisation in 10,500BC. Indeed, so complete does his conversion appear to have been that in a recentdenunication of John West’s geological theories concerning the Sphinx he feltcompelled to state: ‘I believe we have a professional responsibility to respondto notions—like those of Cayce and West—that would rob the Egyptians of theirown heritage by assigning the origins and genius of Nile Valley civilization tosome long-lost agent like Atlantis.’[180] [index_split_036.html#filepos803900]Lehner does not attempt to deny his own former involvement with the Edgar CayceFoundation, or with ideas about Atlantis, but seeks instead to find ways toreconcile the origins of his former interests in ‘mystical interpretations ofthe Pyramids and the Sphinx’ with his present hardcore commitment to ‘bedrockrealities’. Lehner compares his situation to that of Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie,who had come to Egypt in the 1880s ‘to test the mystical “pyramid inch” againstthe stone of Khufu’s pyramid’—and found the ‘pyramid inch’ wanting.[181][index_split_036.html#filepos804026] Petrie, as we shall see in the nextchapter, had followed in the footsteps of his father, William, and the notoriousAstronomer Royal of Scotland, Piazzi Smyth—both of whom passionately believedthat the Great Pyramid had been built under divine inspiration by the Israelitesduring their bondage in Egypt.[182] [index_split_036.html#filepos805134]Lunch with Mr. CayceIn May 1994 we flew to New York and made our way by car to Virginia Beach inNorfolk, Virginia, where the headquarters of the Edgar Cayce Foundation, and itspartner organization the Association for Research and Enlightenment, arelocated. We wanted to explore the unexpected connections that this organizationhad at one time enjoyed with Mark Lehner, and were curious to know how—if atall—the Egyptian Antiquities Organization and Zahi Hawass, Lehner’s colleague atGiza, fitted into all this.Mutual friends arranged a meeting for us with the current President of the AREand the Edgar Cayce Foundation, Mr. Charles Thomas Cayce, the grandson of EdgarCayce. We were also to meet two prominent ARE members who, we were informed, hadcontributed to various projects at Giza in the 1970s and 1980s and to the morerecent geological investigations carried out by John West and Robert Schoch.The venue was the Edgar Cayce Foundation and ARE headquarters on AtlanticAvenue. There we were greeted by cheerful and friendly staff. It was a normalbusy day and we saw visitors of all ages browsing in the well-stocked libraryand bookshop and making their way to various lectures and meditation classes.The general atmosphere was a bit like that of the campus of a small universityor college.We were taken for lunch by Mr. Cayce at the nearby Ramada Oceanfront Hotel.There we were joined by the two senior ARE members who had come from New Yorkand Washington to meet us. The discussion at the table ranged widely andincluded what seemed to be a completely open and honest review of the ARE’svarious initiatives at Giza over the previous two decades. Everyone seemed toknow Mark Lehner well, and both the man from Washington and the man from NewYork also spoke of Zahi Hawass in extremely personal and friendly terms.At this point we could not avoid bringing up the matter of John West’s recentsensational NBC television documentary, Mystery of the Sphinx which, as we sawin Part I, Lehner had treated with disfavour and which had also provoked thefollowing vigorous rebuttal from Zahi Hawass:The film indicates an attempt by these pretenders to prove that the age of theSphinx dates back to fifteen thousand years ... [and that] the builders of theSphinx, and consequently the Pyramids and other great antiquities, were not theancient Egyptians but other people of higher culture and education that camefrom the ‘Atlantis’ continent after its destruction and put beneath the Sphinxthe scientific records of the lost continent! It is evident that this John Westrepresents nothing but a continuation of the cultural invasion of Egypt’scivilization. Before him was Edgar Cayce in Virginia who pretended he lived inAtlantis fifteen thousand years ago and then fled to Egypt with the recordswhich he buried near the Sphinx before the destruction of the continent!...[183] [index_split_036.html#filepos806208]Presented late in 1993 by the Hollywood actor Charlton Heston, Mystery of theSphinx had been partially financed by the ECF/ARE and their supporters, and hadvery strongly endorsed the view that the Sphinx, and a number of the othermonuments on the Giza necropolis, must date back to at least the eleventhmillennium BC.[184] [index_split_036.html#filepos806480] As we reported in PartI, it was this same documentary that had also broken the news of ThomasDobecki’s seismic surveys around the Sphinx and his discovery of a largerectangular chamber buried deep in the bedrock beneath its front paws. This, ofcourse, had suggested to the ECF/ARE that there could be a connection withCayce’s ‘Hall of Records’. As Charlton Heston remarked in his commentary: ‘theunexpected cavity detected by the seismograph was located precisely where EdgarCayce said it would be—under the front paws of the Sphinx.’[185][index_split_036.html#filepos806725]We asked Charles Cayce and his two colleagues how they felt about Hawass’s angryand dismissive reaction to the film and his talk of ‘pretenders’.The ARE men simply smiled and shrugged their shoulders. They were veryconfident, they informed us, that everything was working for the best: no matterwhat anybody said or did, the truth about Giza was going to emerge and the ‘Hallof Records’ was going to be discovered, just as Edgar Cayce had prophesied.[186][index_split_036.html#filepos806811] On this note we parted company.CorrespondenceOn 15 October 1995, Mark Lehner wrote us a five-page letter in response to adraft of this chapter that we had asked him to review.[187][index_split_036.html#filepos807062] In the same letter he informed us that hehad recently resigned from Chicago University’s Oriental Institute to ‘devotemore time to research and writing’. He also notified us that he intended topublish a book on ‘New Age beliefs and Ancient Egypt’ which, he said, wouldexpound, in greater detail than we have done here, on his involvement with workfunded by the Edgar Cayce Foundation.[188] [index_split_036.html#filepos807304]Our correspondence with Lehner was care of the Harvard Semitic Museum in thestate of Massachusetts. As we write these words his colleague in Egypt, Dr. ZahiHawass, is supervising the excavation of a newly discovered ‘Old Kingdom’ templecomplex with underground tunnels immediately to the south-east of the GreatSphinx of Giza.[189] [index_split_036.html#filepos807424] Interviewed inDecember 1995 for a possible television documentary concerning the mysteries ofthe Sphinx, Hawass led the film crew into a tunnel beneath the Sphinx itself.‘Really,’ he said, ‘even Indiana Jones will never dream to be here. Can youbelieve it? We are now inside the Sphinx in this tunnel. This tunnel has beennever opened before. No one really knows what’s inside this tunnel. But we aregoing to open it for the first time.’POSTSCRIPT: Further correspondence with Mark Lehner, giving his comments on thischapter, is reproduced in Appendix 3."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6> > The Case of the Iron Plate, the Freemasons,> > the Relics and the Shafts‘I am more than convinced of the ... existence of a passage and probably achamber (in the Great Pyramid) containing possibly the records of the ancientfounders ...’John Dixon. Letter to Piazzi Smyth dated 25 November 1871, commenting on theQueen’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid‘Deep inside the Great Pyramid lies a dead end [in the southern shaft of theQueen’s Chamber]. Rudolf Gantenbrink could explore beyond it, but no one willlet him.’Sunday Telegraph, London, 1 January 1995Perhaps the most exotic researcher ever to have pronounced on the mysteries ofthe Pyramids was Charles Piazzi Smyth, a nineteenth-century Astronomer Royal ofScotland. Like Edgar Cayce, he believed the Great Pyramid to be somehow linkedto Biblical prophecies concerning the ‘Second Coming’ of Christ. And like EdgarCayce, too, his name turns up most unexpectedly in connection with recentremarkable discoveries at Giza.[190] [index_split_036.html#filepos807796]We will see why, later in this chapter. Meanwhile, as many readers will recallfrom the international news coverage it received at the time, high hopes wereraised in March 1993 of a possible hidden chamber deep within the Great Pyramid.Rudolf Gantenbrink, a Munich-based German engineer, had used a tiny, hi-techrobot camera to explore the long narrow shafts emanating from the northern andsouthern walls of the Queen’s Chamber and, at the end of the southern shaft (theone targeted on the star Sirius) had discovered a small portcullis door completewith copper handles. Immediately after the find was made, Dr. Zahi Hawassenthused to a German television team ‘in my opinion this is THE discovery inEgypt’ and expressed the hope that ‘records’ on papyrus scrolls to do with the‘religion’ of the builders and maybe the ‘stars’, might be stashed away behindthe tantalizing door.[191] [index_split_036.html#filepos808146] Similar hopeswere also raised in The Times of London which, in addition, noted a curious linkwith Edgar Cayce and the ‘Hall of Records’:SECRET PASSAGE POSES PYRAMID MYSTERY: In the 1940s Edgar Cayce, the Americanclairvoyant, prophesied the discovery, in the last quarter of the 20th centuryand somewhere near the Sphinx, of a hidden chamber containing the historicalrecords of Atlantis. Whether recent discoveries in the Great Pyramid of Cheops[Khufu] have anything to do with that is far from certain, but the discovery ofa small door at the end of a long, hitherto unexplored, 8-inch square shaft hasset many speculating about what, if anything, might lie behind it ...’[192][index_split_036.html#filepos808430]As we write these words, more than three years after Rudolf Gantenbrink made hisamazing discovery, no further exploration has been permitted inside the southernshaft of the Queen’s Chamber and the mysterious portcullis door remainsunopened. During this period we note that Dr. Zahi Hawass (rather like hisfriend Mark Lehner over the issue of 10,500 BC) has executed a radicalvolte-face. Gone are the eulogies and the great expectations and he now asserts:‘I think this is not a door and nothing is behind it ...’[193][index_split_036.html#filepos808587]Double standardThe story of the Great Pyramid’s shafts, and the oddly contradictoryEgyptological responses to whatever is discovered in them—or whatever new ideasare proposed concerning them—goes back to the late 1830s when the Britishexplorer Colonel Howard Vyse ‘sat down before the Great Pyramid as at a fortressto be besieged’. This comment, from one of his contemporaries, alludes to Vyse’srenowned use of dynamite to ‘explore’ the Great Pyramid.[194][index_split_036.html#filepos808720] It might have been more appropriate, thoughless polite, to say that he confronted the last surviving wonder of the ancientworld as though it were a woman to be raped. Nevertheless, the fact remains thatduring a hectic season of explorations and intrusive excavations (1836-7), Vyseand his team did manage to make what looked like two extremely importantdiscoveries:1. A section of flat iron plate, about one eighth of an inch thick, afoot long and four inches wide, extracted from the masonry of the southern faceof the Pyramid at the exit point of the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber(the shaft targeted on Orion’s belt).2. ‘Quarry marks’ daubed inside the so-called relieving chambers abovethe King’s Chamber. These hieroglyphs are the first and only ‘inscriptions’ everfound inside the Great Pyramid. They take the form of loosely scrawled graffitiand include the name of Khufu, the Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh whom Egyptologistssuppose to have been the builder of the monument.The second find—the appearance of Khufu’s name—has been repeatedly hailed byEgyptologists during the past 160 years as proof positive that the otherwiseanonymous Pyramid was indeed built by the Pharaoh Khufu. The first—the ironplate—has been dismissed as a fraud and the plate itself now lies in a narrowdrawer in the British Museum, as ignored and forgotten as the skull of PiltdownMan.[195] [index_split_036.html#filepos808870]Suppose, however, that the Egyptologists have got things the wrong way round?Suppose that it is the ‘quarry marks’ that are forged and the iron plate that isgenuine?In this case the tidy and well-worked-out chronology of the evolution ofEgyptian society, which appears in all the standard textbooks, would be shown torest on frighteningly insecure foundations, the attribution of the Great Pyramidto Khufu would revert to undocumented speculation, and the orthodox date of theIron Age in Egypt—placed by Egyptologists as being not earlier than 650 BC[196][index_split_036.html#filepos809035]—would have to be pushed back almost 2000years.We have argued elsewhere, and at length, that the quarry marks inside the GreatPyramid could have been forged—and specifically that Howard Vyse, who had spent£10,000 on his 1836-7 excavations (a princely sum in those days) had both themotive and the opportunity to forge them.[197][index_split_036.html#filepos809366] Briefly:1. It is notable that the marks were only discovered in the four‘relieving chambers’ opened by Vyse himself, and not in the chamber immediatelybelow these (and immediately above the ceiling of the King’s Chamber) which hadbeen opened by a previous explorer, Nathaniel Davison, in 1765. It is alsonotable that Vyse’s diary entry for the day on which he first opened andaccessed the lowest of ‘his’ four chambers (i.e. the one above Davison’sChamber) reports a thorough examination but makes no mention whatsoever of anyhieroglyphs prominently daubed on the walls in red paint. On the very next day,however, when Vyse returned to the chamber with witnesses, the hieroglyphs weresuddenly there—almost as though they had been painted overnight.[198][index_split_036.html#filepos809577]2. As one of Vyse’s critics has perceptively pointed out, ‘theperspective and angles at which the inscriptions were made shows that they werepainted not by the quarry masons before the blocks were moved, but rather bysomeone working in the cramped quarters of the [relieving] chambers after theblocks had been placed in the Pyramid. Instructions for locating blocks in aconstruction project [which is what the quarry marks purport to be] serve nopurpose after the fact has been accomplished. Clearly they were added by someoneelse and not by the builders themselves.’[199][index_split_036.html#filepos809726]3. There are horrendous ‘orthographic’ problems with the hieroglyphs.These problems were first pointed out in the nineteenth century by Samuel Birch,a British Museum expert on the ancient Egyptian language. Although nobody eitherthen or now has paid any attention to his comments, he made the importantobservation that the styles of writing expressed in the ‘quarry marks’ are astrange anomalistic hotchpotch of different eras. Some of the cursive forms andtitles used in these supposedly Fourth Dynasty inscriptions are found nowhereelse in Egypt until the Middle Kingdom, about 1000 years later (when they becomeplentiful). Others are unknown until the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (664-525 BC).Perhaps most telling of all, however, is the use of certain words and phrases ina completely unique and zany way that occurs nowhere else in the entiresprawling corpus of writings that has come down to us from ancient Egyptiantimes. To give an example, the hieroglyph for ‘good, gracious’ appears where thenumber 18 is meant.[200] [index_split_036.html#filepos809821]4. There are difficulties with the name Khufu itself as it is given inthe quarry marks. It contains a mistake (a dot surrounded by a circle instead ofa simple filled-in circle) that—like the usage of the ‘good, gracious’hieroglyph—is repeated on no other ancient Egyptian inscription. Interestingly,however, this same mistake in the writing out of the name Khufu occurs in theonly two source books on hieroglyphs that would have been available to Vyse in1837: Leon de Laborde’s Voyage de l’Arabie Petree and Sir John GardnerWilkinson’s Materia Hieroglyphica.[201] [index_split_036.html#filepos809972]5. Last but not least, even if the quarry marks were not forged by Vyse,what do they really prove? Isn’t attributing the Great Pyramid to Khufu on thebasis of a few lines of graffiti a bit like handing over the keys of the EmpireState building to a man named ‘Kilroy’ just because his name was foundspray-painted on the walls of the lift?We are frankly puzzled that such questions are never asked and, in general, thatEgyptologists are so ready to accept the quarry marks as ‘proof of Khufu’sownership of the Pyramid. Their own credulity on such matters is of course theirbusiness. Nevertheless we think that it verges on intellectual chicanery for thesame dubious attribution to be regurgitated again and again, in all the standardtexts, without any cautionary notes about the many problems, anachronisms andinconsistencies that cast doubt on the authenticity and significance of Vyse’s‘discovery’.[202] [index_split_036.html#filepos810080]Strangely, however, his other ‘discovery’, which Egyptologists todayunhesitatingly write off as a forgery, gives every indication of beinggenuine—and highly significant. This was the discovery of a flat iron plateembedded in the masonry of the Pyramid’s southern face.The iron plate affairAs we have seen, the two main chambers in the superstructure of the GreatPyramid—the King’s Chamber and the Queen’s Chamber—are each equipped with twolong, narrow shafts which bore deep into the solid masonry, one directednorthward and the other to the south. Those emanating from the King’s Chambercut right through to the outside. Those emanating from the Queen’s Chamber stopsomewhere within the core of the monument.The existence of the King’s Chamber shafts was first recorded by Dr. JohnGreaves, a British astronomer, in 1636. It was not until 1837, however, thatthey were investigated thoroughly—by Colonel Howard Vyse with the assistance oftwo civil engineers, John Perring and James Mash. Another member of Vyse’s teamwas Mr. J. R. Hill, an obscure Englishman living in Cairo, who in May of 1837was put in charge of clearing the mouth of the southern shaft (which emerges atthe 102nd course of masonry on the south face of the Pyramid). In accord withVyse’s methods elsewhere, Hill was instructed to use explosives and was thusresponsible for the ugly vertical scar which may be seen to this day running upthe centre of the south side of the Great Pyramid.On Friday, 26 May 1837, after a couple of days of blasting and clearing, Hilldiscovered the flat iron plate mentioned above. Vyse was soon afterwards totrumpet it in his monumental opus, Operations Carried on at the Pyramids ofGizeh as ‘the oldest piece of wrought iron known’,[203][index_split_036.html#filepos810247] but Hill at the time was content to writeup the discovery in the proper, sober manner:This is to certify that the piece of iron found by me near the mouth of theair-passage [shaft], in the southern side of the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, onFriday, May 20th, was taken out by me from an inner joint, after having removedby blasting the two outer tiers of the stones of the present surface of thePyramid; and that no joint or opening of any sort was connected with the abovementioned joint, by which the iron could have been placed in it after theoriginal building of the Pyramid. I also shewed the exact spot to Mr. Perring,on Saturday, June 24th.[204] [index_split_036.html#filepos810523]John Perring, a civil engineer, thus examined the exact spot of the find. Withhim was James Mash, also a civil engineer, and both were ‘of the opinion thatthe iron must have been left in the joint during the building of the Pyramid,and that it could not have been inserted afterwards’.[205][index_split_036.html#filepos810618] Ultimately Vyse sent the mysteriousartefact, together with the certifications of Hill, Perring and Mash, to theBritish Museum. There, from the outset, the general feeling was that it couldnot be a genuine piece, because wrought iron was unknown in the Pyramid Age, andthat it must therefore have been ‘introduced’ in much more recent times.In 1881 the plate was re-examined by Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie who found itdifficult, for a variety of cogent reasons, to agree with this analysis:Though some doubt has been thrown on the piece, merely from its rarity, [henoted] yet the vouchers for it are very precise; and it has a cast of anummulite [fossilized marine protozoa] on the rust of it, proving it to havebeen buried for ages beside a block of nummulitic limestone, and therefore to becertainly ancient. No reasonable doubt can therefore exist about its being areally genuine piece ...[206] [index_split_036.html#filepos810704]Despite this forceful opinion from one of the oddball giants of Egyptology inthe late Victorian Age, the profession as a whole has been unable to cope withthe idea of a piece of wrought iron being contemporary with the Great Pyramid.Such a notion goes completely against the grain of every preconception thatEgyptologists internalize throughout their careers concerning the ways in whichcivilizations evolve and develop.Scientific analysisBecause of these preoccupations, no further investigations of any significancewere undertaken into the iron plate for another 108 years and it was not until1989 that a fragment from it was at last subjected to rigorous optical andchemical tests. The scientists responsible for the work were Dr. M. P. Jones,Senior Tutor in the Mineral Resources Engineering Department at ImperialCollege, London, and his colleague Dr. Sayed El Gayer, a lecturer in the Facultyof Petroleum and Mining at Egypt’s Suez University, who gained his Ph.D. inextraction metallurgy at the University of Aston in Birmingham.[207][index_split_036.html#filepos810904]They began their study by checking on the nickel content of the iron plate.Their reason for doing this was to exclude the faint possibility that it mighthave been manufactured from meteoritic iron (i.e. iron from fallen meteorites—amaterial that is known, very rarely, to have been used during the Pyramid Age).Ready-made meteoritic iron of this sort, however, is always extremely easy toidentify because it invariably contains a significant proportion ofnickel—typically seven per cent or more.[208][index_split_036.html#filepos811195] On the basis of their first test Jones andEl Gayer noted: ‘The iron plate from Giza is clearly not of meteoritic origin,since it contains only a trace of nickel.’ The metal, therefore, was man-made.But how had it been made?Further tests proved that it had been smelted at a temperature between 1000 and1100 degrees centigrade. These tests also picked up the odd fact that there were‘traces of gold on one face of the iron plate’.[209][index_split_036.html#filepos811451] Perhaps, Jones and El Gayer speculated, itmight originally have been ‘gold-plated, and this gold may be an indication thatthis artefact ... was held in great esteem when it was produced’.[210][index_split_036.html#filepos811583]Finally, when was it produced?After completing an extremely careful and detailed study, the two metallurgistsreported as follows: ‘It is concluded, on the basis of the presentinvestigation, that the iron plate is very ancient. Furthermore, themetallurgical evidence supports the archaeological evidence which suggests thatthe plate was incorporated within the Pyramid at the time that structure wasbeing built.’[211] [index_split_036.html#filepos811669]When Jones and El Gayer submitted their findings to the British Museum, theywere in for quite a surprise. Instead of being excited, officials fobbed themoff: ‘The structure of the iron plate is unusual,’ conceded Paul Craddock andJanet Lang. ‘We are not sure of the significance or origin of this structure butit is not necessarily indicative of great age.’[212][index_split_036.html#filepos811755]The British Museum’s viewBecause the iron plate appeared to have been removed originally from within ornear the mouth of the King’s Chamber’s ‘Orion’ shaft it was of great interest tous. We decided to take a look at it. Through Dr. A. J. Spencer, AssistantCurator of the Egyptian Antiquities Department at the British Museum, wearranged a viewing on 7 November 1993. We were permitted to handle the plate andwere intrigued by its unusual weight and texture. We could also hardly fail tonotice that under its surface patina the internal metal possessed a brilliantshine—which was revealed at the point where the fragment had been cleanly slicedoff for El Gayer’s and Jones’s analysis. Dr. Spencer repeated the BritishMuseum’s official line—that the plate was not old but had been introduced,probably deliberately, in Vyse’s time—and that El Gayer and Jones’s conclusionswere ‘highly dubious’.[213] [index_split_036.html#filepos811937]How and why could the conclusions of such eminent metallurgists be deemed‘highly dubious’, we asked?Dr. Spencer had no answer and Dr. Craddock, whom we spoke to on the phone, didnot wish to elaborate.A few days later we called Dr. M. P. Jones and heard from him how he and Dr. ElGayer had examined the plate in the laboratories at Imperial College London in1989. Dr. Jones is now retired and lives in Wales. When we asked him what hethought of the British Museum’s view of his conclusions he was, understandably,rather irritated. He insisted that the iron plate was ‘very old’ and, like us,he felt—since there were two opposing views—that the best way to resolve thismatter would be further testing in an independent laboratory.After all, the implications of man-made iron in 2500 BC are tremendous. And thisisn’t just a matter of redating the so-called Iron Age. Perhaps in a way moreintriguing are the questions raised as to the function that an iron plate mighthave had, inside the southern shaft of the main chamber in the Great Pyramid,many thousands of years ago. Could there be a relationship between this plateand the stone portcullis door with copper ‘handles’ that Rudolf Gantenbrink hadso recently discovered at the end of the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber—ashaft directed to ‘Sirius-Isis’, the consort of ‘Orion-Osiris’?In their 1989 report, El Gayer and Jones noted that the plate was probably afragment coming from a larger piece which might originally have composed asquare plate that would have fitted, like a sort of ‘gate’, neatly over themouth of the shaft.StargateIn later chapters we will make detailed reference to the so-called ‘PyramidTexts’ of ancient Egypt. These texts take the form of extensive funerary andrebirth inscriptions carved on the tomb walls of certain Fifth—and Sixth-Dynastypyramids at Saqqara, about ten miles south of Giza. Egyptologists agree thatmuch if not all of the content of the inscriptions predates the PyramidAge.[214] [index_split_036.html#filepos812081] It is thus unsettling to discoverin these ancient scriptures, supposedly the work of neolithic farmers who hadhardly even begun to master copper, that there are abundant references to iron.The name given to it is B’ja—‘the divine metal’—and we always encounter it indistinctive contexts related in one way or another to astronomy, to the starsand to the gods.[215] [index_split_036.html#filepos812207] For example B’ja isfrequently mentioned in the texts in connection with the ‘four sons ofHorus’—presumably related in some way to strange beings called the Shemsu Hor,the ‘Followers of Horus’ and ‘Transfigured Ones’, whom we shall also bediscussing in later chapters. At any rate, these very mysterious ‘sons of Horus’seem to have been made of iron or to have had iron fingers: ‘Your children’schildren together have raised you up, namely [the four sons of Horus] ... yourmouth is split open with their iron fingers ...’[216][index_split_036.html#filepos812511]Iron is also mentioned in the texts as being necessary for the construction of abizarre instrument called a Meshtyw. Very much resembling a carpenter’s adze orcutting tool, this was a ceremonial device which was used to ‘strike open themouth’ of the deceased Pharaoh’s mummified and embalmed corpse—an indispensableritual if the Pharaoh’s soul were to be re-awakened to eternal life amidst thecycles of the stars.In the Pyramid Texts we thus find a high priest making this cryptic statement:Your mouth is in good order for I split open your mouth for you ... O king, Iopen your mouth for you with the adze of iron of Upuaut, I split open your mouthfor you with the adze of iron which split open the mouths of the gods ... Horushas split open the mouth of this king with that wherewith he split open themouth of his father, with that wherewith he split open the mouth of Osiris...[217] [index_split_036.html#filepos812702]From such utterances, and many more like them, it is clear that iron was somehowseen by the composers of the Pyramid Texts as being imperative in the ritualsaimed at ensuring new life—cosmic and stellar life—to the dead king. Moreimportantly the above verse also connects the metal and its uses to the ancientprototype of all such rituals by means of which Osiris himself, Egypt’s ‘Onceand Future King’, died and was then restored to immortal life as Lord of thesky-region of Orion. This region, as we shall see in Part III, was known as theDuat. In it all the Pharaohs of Egypt hoped that they would reside eternallyafter their own deaths:The gate of the earth is open for you ... may a stairway to the Duat be set upfor you to the place where Orion is ...[218][index_split_036.html#filepos812802]O king ... the sky conceives you with Orion ... the sky has borne you with Orion...[219] [index_split_036.html#filepos812904]O king, be a soul like a living star ...[220][index_split_036.html#filepos813004]The gate of the earth-god is open ... may you remove yourself to the sky and situpon your iron throne ...[221] [index_split_036.html#filepos813101]The aperture of the sky window is opened for you ...[222][index_split_036.html#filepos813203]The doors of iron which are in the starry sky are thrown open for me, and I gothrough them ...[223] [index_split_036.html#filepos813300]What seems to be envisaged here, taken literally and reduced to the basic commondenominators running through all the above utterances, appears to be nothingless than an iron ‘stargate’ intended to admit Osiris, and all the dynasties ofdead kings after him, into the celestial realms of the belt of Orion. But if thePyramid Texts are describing a stargate then they are also describing atimegate—for they express no doubt that by passing through the iron-dooredportals of the sky the soul of the deceased will attain a life of millions ofyears, navigating eternity in the vessels of the gods. Naturally, therefore, byvirtue of its original position at or near the end of the southern shaft of theKing’s Chamber, we are tempted to wonder whether the neglected iron plate in theBritish Museum might have been connected with such amazingly sophisticatedconcepts and beliefs about immortality and about the ability of ‘the equippedspirit’ to gain a complete mastery over death and time.We wonder, too, what might have been the function of other mysterious objectsthat were discovered in the shafts of the Queen’s Chamber when these were firstopened in 1872 by Waynman Dixon, an enterprising engineer fromNewcastle-upon-Tyne.Unknown dark distanceUnlike the King’s Chamber shafts, those in the Queen’s Chamber (a) do not exiton the outside of the monument and (b) were not originally cut through thechamber’s limestone walls. Instead the builders left the last five inches intactin the last block over the mouth of each of the shafts—thus rendering theminvisible and inaccessible to any casual intruder.The reader will recall the mention of Charles Piazzi Smyth and his prophetictheories about the Great Pyramid at the start of this chapter. In the early1860s, when he was formulating these theories, he befriended a certain WilliamPetrie, an engineer, whose son, W. M. Flinders Petrie, was later to beuniversally acclaimed as the founder of the academic discipline ofEgyptology.[224] [index_split_036.html#filepos813397]William Petrie was amongst the first ‘Pyramidologists’ of the Victorian Age togive strong support to Piazzi Smyth’s notion that the Great Pyramid might besome sort of prophetic monument to Mankind encoding a Messianic blueprintdesigned to serve as an advance-warning mechanism for the ‘Second Coming’ ofChrist.[225] [index_split_036.html#filepos813923] ‘There had been a time’, wroteProfessor Hermann Bruck and Dr. Mary Bruck in their authoritative biography ofthe Astronomer Royal, ‘when Flinders Petrie and his father had wholeheartedlyconcurred with most of Piazzi Smyth’s ideas.’[226][index_split_036.html#filepos814093] Indeed as these two eminent astronomers andauthors point out, the young Flinders Petrie set out to Egypt in 1880 on hisfamous study of the Great Pyramid precisely because he wanted to ‘continuePiazzi Smyth’s work’.[227] [index_split_036.html#filepos814254]Returning now to the shafts in the Queen’s Chamber, we were interested to learnthat their discoverer, the engineer Waynman Dixon—together with his brotherJohn—had also maintained very close ties with Piazzi Smyth. Indeed, it had beenthrough the Astronomer Royal’s direct influence that the Dixons were able toexplore the Great Pyramid in 1872 and discover the previously concealedentrances to the northern and southern star-shafts in the Queen’s Chamber.[228][index_split_036.html#filepos814348]Waynman Dixon’s curiosity had been aroused by the shafts in the King’s Chamberwhich provoked him to look for similar features in the Queen’s Chamber. Thissearch, which took place some time early in 1872, was undertaken with the fullknowledge of Piazzi Smyth, who later described the whole matter in his book. Thestory goes that after noticing a crack in the southern wall of the Queen’sChamber—roughly where he thought that he might find shafts—Waynman Dixon set his‘carpenter and man-of-all-work’, a certain Bill Grundy ‘to jump a hole with ahammer and steel chisel at that place. So to work the faithful fellow went, andwith a will which soon began to make a way into the soft stone at this pointwhen lo! after a comparatively very few strokes, flop went the chisel rightthrough into something or other.’[229] [index_split_036.html#filepos814576]The ‘something or other’ Bill Grundy’s chisel had reached turned out to be ‘arectangular, horizontal, tubular channel, about 9 inches by 8 inches intransverse breadth and height, going back 7 feet into the wall, and then risingat an angle into an unknown dark distance ...’[230][index_split_036.html#filepos814724]This was the southern shaft.Next, measuring off a similar position on the north wall, Waynman Dixon ‘set theinvaluable Bill Grundy to work there with his hammer and steel chisel; andagain, after a very little labour, flop went the said chisel through intosomewhere; which somewhere was presently found to be a horizontal pipe orchannel of transverse proportions like the other, and, at a distance within themasonry of 7 feet, rising at a similar angle, but in the opposite direction, andtrending indefinitely far ...’[231] [index_split_036.html#filepos814810]Together with his brother John, Waynman Dixon made efforts to probe both thenorthern and southern shafts—using a jointed rod, something like achimney-sweep’s rod, for this purpose.[232] [index_split_036.html#filepos814896]Late-nineteenth-century technology was not up to the job and a segment of therod became wedged in the northern shaft, where it still remains.[233][index_split_036.html#filepos815556] Before this happened, however, the Dixonsfound three small relics in the shafts.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image033.jpg]33. Detail of Queen’s Chamber shaft.These objects—a rough stone sphere, a small two-pronged hook made out of someform of metal, and a fine piece of cedar wood some 12 centimetres long withstrange notches cut into it[234] [index_split_036.html#filepos816037]—wereexported from Egypt in the summer of 1872 and arrived safely in England a fewweeks later.[235] [index_split_036.html#filepos816158] During the next year orso they were commented upon in books, and even illustrated in scientific andpopular magazines such as Nature and the London Graphic.[236][index_split_036.html#filepos816301] Before the turn of the century, however,they had disappeared.[237] [index_split_036.html#filepos816714]LinksA curious series of links exists involving all of the following:· the discovery of the Queen’s Chamber shafts with their constituentrelics;· the formation of the Egyptian Exploration Society (the EES, BritishEgyptology’s most prestigious organization);· the foundation, at University College, London, of Egyptology’s mostprestigious Chair;· British Freemasonry.In 1872, whilst the Dixon brothers were exploring the Great Pyramid, awell-known Freemason and parliamentarian, Sir James Alexander, proposed a motionto bring to Britain the incorrectly named ‘Cleopatra’s Needle’—a 200-ton obeliskof Pharaoh Thutmosis III which had originally been erected some 3500 years agoin the sacred city of Heliopolis.[238] [index_split_036.html#filepos817071]Funding for the project came from the personal fortune of another Freemason, theeminent British dermatologist, Sir Erasmus Wilson,[239][index_split_036.html#filepos817247] and Sir James Alexander recommended thatthe civil engineer John Dixon—also a Freemason—should be engaged to collect theobelisk from Egypt. On this basis Sir Erasmus Wilson promptly recruited JohnDixon—and also his brother, Waynman, who was then living in Egypt.[240][index_split_036.html#filepos817344]A few years later the same Erasmus Wilson was responsible for the creation ofthe Egyptian Exploration Society (the EES) and served as its firstpresident.[241] [index_split_036.html#filepos817529] Then in 1883, Wilson andthe Victorian author Amelia Edwards co-founded the important Chair in Egyptologyat University College London—and it was through Wilson’s personal recommendationthat the young Flinders Petrie became the first scholar to occupy it.[242][index_split_036.html#filepos817745]Perhaps all such connections are nothing more than quaint coincidences. If so,then it is probably also a coincidence that in the seventeenth century thefounder of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, one of the most prestigious oftoday’s Egyptological research centres (which holds the coveted ‘Petrie Chair’),was none other than Elias Ashmole—the first man ever, according to Masonichistorians, to be openly initiated on British soil into the hitherto secretsociety of Freemasonry.[243] [index_split_036.html#filepos817840]We have no evidence that the Brotherhood is still a significant influence inEgyptology today. Our researches into the pedigree of this insular discipline,however, did, in a rather oblique way, lead to the rediscovery of two of thethree missing ‘Dixon’ relics.The British Museum and the missing cigar boxThese three items are the only relics ever to have been found inside the GreatPyramid. Moreover the place in which they were found, i.e. the star-shafts ofthe Queen’s Chamber, links them directly to one of the key aspects of our ownresearch. In the summer of 1993, therefore, 121 years after they had beendiscovered, we resolved to try to find out what had happened to them.Going back through press reports, and the private diaries of the figuresinvolved, we found out that John and Waynman Dixon had brought the relics toEngland in a cigar box. We also learned, as noted earlier, that the Dixons hadbeen involved in bringing to England Cleopatra’s Needle. The obelisk was erectedon the Thames Embankment, where it stands to this day. John Dixon was at theinauguration ceremony and was on record as having buried ‘a large cigar box,contents unknown’ beneath the pedestal of the monument.[244][index_split_036.html#filepos818109]The logic looked persuasive. John Dixon brought the relics to England in a cigarbox. John Dixon brought Cleopatra’s Needle to England. And John Dixon buried acigar box beneath Cleopatra’s Needle. Around that time the relics disappeared.The strong Masonic link in this affair called to mind a well-known practice inoperative and speculative Freemasonry which involves certain rituals whenplacing the corner-stones of Masonic monuments and edifices. This practicesuggested the possibility that the relics from the Great Pyramid could have beenhidden under Cleopatra’s Needle along with the other Masonic paraphernalia andmemorabilia known to have been installed there.[245][index_split_036.html#filepos818248]At any rate, the relics did genuinely seem to have disappeared and the expertswhom we consulted at the British Museum said they had no idea where they couldhave gone to. We also consulted Professor I. E. S. Edwards, the Museum’s formerKeeper of Egyptian Antiquities (1954-74) and a former vice-president of the EES.Edwards is Britain’s foremost authority on Giza and the author of a definitivetext, The Pyramids of Egypt, first published in 1946 and reprinted virtuallyevery year since then. In all editions of this book we found that he hadmentioned Waynman Dixon and reported how the shafts in the Queen’s Chamber werediscovered, but had made absolutely no reference to the relics. This, he toldus, was because he had no recollection of them and therefore, of course, no ideaconcerning what their ultimate fate might have been.Like ourselves, however, Professor Edwards knew of the link between FlindersPetrie, Piazzi Smyth and the Dixons, and knew that Petrie’s exploration of theGreat Pyramid had immediately followed that of the Dixons.Oddly enough, Petrie, too, makes no mention of the relics in his own famous bookPyramids and Temples of Gizeh—though he does speak of the Dixons and the shafts.But could he have referred to them elsewhere in his voluminous publications?Edwards suggested that we ask Petrie’s biographer, the Egyptologist Mrs.Margaret Hackford-Jones, to research the matter in Petrie’s diaries and privatepapers. If he had made any mention of the Dixon relics then she would definitelybe able to find it. But a thorough search by Mrs. Hackford-Jones brought noresults.[246] [index_split_036.html#filepos818445]In the absence of viable alternatives, therefore, we wondered whether it mightnot be worth looking to see whether the three curious objects might not still bein Dixon’s cigar box underneath Cleopatra’s Needle.The story was picked up by the Independent, a British national newspaper, on 6December 1993. Interviewed in the report, Professor Edwards stated categoricallythat neither he nor anyone else he knew had heard of these relics before.[247][index_split_036.html#filepos818572] We were therefore taken by surprise on 13December 1993—only a week after the article containing Edwards’s quote waspublished—when Dr. Vivian Davies, the Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities at theBritish Museum, casually announced in a letter to the Independent that therelics, still in the cigar box, were in his Department’s keep.[248][index_split_036.html#filepos818695]So why had his Department not admitted to having them before?‘I think there has been a lot of misunderstanding about this whole business,’soothed a Museum PR spokesman a few days later. ‘We didn’t say we did not havethem, we said we were not aware of having them.’[249][index_split_036.html#filepos818813]After doing some more digging we discovered what had happened. The relics (orrather two of them because the only carbon-datable item, the piece of wood, wasmissing) had not been placed under Cleopatra’s Needle as we had at firstconjectured. Instead they had remained in the hands of the Dixon family forexactly a hundred years. Then, in 1972, Dixon’s great-granddaughter had takenthem along to the British Museum and had generously donated them to the EgyptianAntiquities Department. Their receipt was recorded in the meticulous hand of theKeeper himself—Dr. I. E. S. Edwards.[250] [index_split_036.html#filepos818992]Thereafter the relics seemed simply to have been forgotten and only resurfacedin December 1993 because an Egyptologist named Dr. Peter Shore happened to readthe Independent’s story about our search for them. Now retired in Liverpool,Shore had been Edwards’s assistant in 1972. He remembered the arrival of therelics at the British Museum and now promptly notified the relevant authoritiesthat they had a potentially embarrassing incident on their hands.We naturally wondered how it was possible that mysterious relics recovered fromunexplored shafts inside the Great Pyramid of Egypt could have been treated withsuch indifference by professional Egyptologists. To be completely honest wefound it very difficult to accept that they really could just have beenforgotten for twenty-one years by the British Museum’s Egyptian AntiquitiesDepartment. What we could not understand at all, however, was how they couldhave stayed forgotten during most of 1993 after a robot had explored the verysame shafts and found a much publicized closed ‘door’ deep within one of them.Indeed more than two weeks before the article in the Independent came out,Rudolf Gantenbrink, the discoverer of the ‘door’, had visited London and given afull lecture at the British Museum to a large group of Egyptologists—includingProfessor Edwards, Dr. Vivian Davies and many others who knew of our search forthe ‘Dixon’ relics. During the lecture, Gantenbrink showed and explaineddetailed video footage, taken by his robot, of the interior of the Queen’sChamber shafts—i.e. the shafts in which the relics had been found. As well asthe ‘door’ at the end of the southern shaft, the footage also clearly showed,still lying on the floor of the northern shaft, but at higher levels than theDixons had been able to reach, at least two distinct objects—a metallic hook,and an apparent baton of wood.[251] [index_split_036.html#filepos819122]In the next chapter we shall take a look at Gantenbrink’s exploration, and atthe events that led up to and followed it."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7> > The Case of the Robot,> > the Germans and the Door‘Upuaut, a wolf deity ... He was chiefly revered for his role as Opener of theWays to the Underworld, showing the dead souls the path through that dark realm...’Veronica Ions, Egyptian Mythology, 1982The introduction of a robot-camera into the narrow mouth of the southern shaftof the Queen’s Chamber in March 1993, and the subsequent spectacular discoveryof a closed portcullis ‘door’ 200 feet along that shaft, are not events thatoccurred in a vacuum. On the contrary, although mainstream Egyptologists professlittle interest in the Queen’s Chamber (which they generally regard as an‘unfinished’, ‘abandoned’ and unimportant feature of the Great Pyramid), quite alot of activity had taken place around it during the previous decade.In 1986, for example, two French architects, Gilles Dormion and Jean-PatriceGoidin, somehow managed to obtain a scientific licence to conduct a spectacularexploration inside the Great Pyramid. Dormion and Goidin had persuaded certainsenior officials at the Egyptian Antiquities Organization that a ‘hiddenchamber’ could lie behind the west wall of the horizontal corridor leading tothe Queen’s Chamber. In a rare move, the EAO gave permission for the drilling ofa series of small holes to test the theory. Apparently some evidence was foundof a large ‘cavity’ which was filled with unusually fine sand—nothing more—butthis was enough to send the world media into a frenzy and to turn Dormion andGoidin into hot media properties for a while. Egyptologists fumed on the quiet.The project was eventually stopped and Dormion and Goidin were never to resumetheir work in the Great Pyramid.[252] [index_split_036.html#filepos819360]The same thing happened again in 1988 when a Japanese scientific team fromWaseda University took up the challenge. They were led by Professor SakujiYoshimura. This time the Japanese used ‘non-destructive techniques’ based on ahigh-tech system of electromagnetic waves and radar equipment. They, too,detected the existence of a ‘cavity’ off the Queen’s Chamber passageway, somethree metres under the floor and, as it turned out, very close to where theFrench had drilled. They also detected a large cavity behind the north-west wallof the Queen’s Chamber itself, and a ‘tunnel’ outside and to the south of thePyramid which appeared to run underneath the monument. Before any furtherexploration or drilling could be done, the Egyptian authorities intervened andhalted the project. Yoshimura and his team were never to return to completetheir work in the Queen’s Chamber.[253] [index_split_036.html#filepos819639]It seems odd, despite all the buzz concerning hidden chambers in the vicinity ofthe Queen’s Chamber, that nobody should have taken a closer look into theQueen’s Chamber’s mysterious and hitherto unexplored shafts. Disappearing asthey do, one northwards and the other southwards, into the bowels of themonument, one would have thought that somebody would have had the gumption toinvestigate them (using video-camera reconnaissance instead of all theseunsatisfactory and inconclusive drillings and radar scanning probes). Indeed, aswe have argued elsewhere, there is much about their construction and design thatcould almost have been deliberately contrived to stimulate and invite suchinvestigations.[254] [index_split_036.html#filepos819745] Throughout the 1980s,however, the consensus of senior Egyptologists was that the shafts, like theQueen’s Chamber itself, were ‘abandoned’ features of the Great Pyramid. No doubtit was the power of this consensus, and the built-in reluctance to challenge it,that discouraged individual Egyptologists from interesting themselves in theshafts. After all, what would be the point of exploring obscure parts of thePyramid that everyone knew had been ‘abandoned’ during construction.As a non-Egyptologist, the German robotics engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink did notsuffer from such inhibitions. Early in 1991 he submitted a proposal for thevideoscopic examination of the shafts to the German Archaeological Institute inCairo.Planning an adventureGantenbrink’s story, as he reported it to us in many hours of documentedconversations, goes back to August 1990 when the Egyptian AntiquitiesOrganization commissioned the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo toinstall a ventilation system inside the Great Pyramid. This project would mainlyinvolve the ‘cleaning’ of the two shafts of the King’s Chamber which (unlikethose in the Queen’s Chamber) emerge on the outside faces of the pyramid andthus could be of some conceivable use for ventilation. After cleaning, powerfulelectric fans would be installed in their mouths to boost the natural air-flowthrough them.A few months after accepting the EAO’s commission for the ventilation projectRainer Stadelmann, the Director of the German Archaeological Institute, receivedRudolf Gantenbrink’s proposal for the exploration of the Queen’s Chamber shaftsusing a high-tech miniature robot. This proposal, a copy of which Gantenbrinkhas kindly supplied to us, is entitled Videoscopische Untersuchung der sog.Luftkanale der Cheopspyramide (Videoscopic Investigation of the so-called AirShafts in the Pyramid of Cheops).[255] [index_split_036.html#filepos820498]The proposal outlines Gantenbrink’s plans to build a special robot equipped withtwo powerful lamps and a ‘CCD Farbvideokamera’ with a special fixed-focus lensgiving a full go-degrees angle of vision. The specifications of the robot wouldinclude a powerful electric motor in order for it to be able to tackle the steepslopes of the shafts. The video camera and the motor would be controlled from aconsole and monitor unit stationed inside the chamber and linked to the robot byelectric cables. Caterpillar tracks would be fixed above and below the robot’schassis and adjusted with two sets of powerful hydrolic-suspension units inorder to ensure a good grip on the ceiling and floor of the shafts.There is nothing in the Videoscopische study about ventilation. What itdescribes is unambiguously an exploration into the uncharted regions of theGreat Pyramid, an adventure in the Queen’s Chamber shafts—a ‘robot’s journeyinto the past’.[256] [index_split_036.html#filepos820658] Nevertheless the nextmove was logical enough: Stadelmann passed over the EAO’s ‘ventilation’ schemeto Rudolf Gantenbrink.Nor did Gantenbrink object. He had intended, in any case, to examine the King’sChamber shafts at some point during his project and saw no difficulty in fittingthese shafts with the electric fans called for by the ventilation scheme. Indeedthe idea of getting involved in ventilating the Pyramid as well as exploring itrather appealed to him since it added a ‘conservation and restoration’ elementto his work.Diversion and delayAs planned, however, Gantenbrink began with the exploration of the Queen’sChamber shafts. Assigned by the German Archaeological Institute to assistGantenbrink, and to serve as the Institute’s official representative on site,was Uli Kapp (who, coincidentally, had also assisted Mark Lehner on the ARCESphinx Project in 1979-80).[257] [index_split_036.html#filepos821011] The startdate was February 1992 and the decision was made to tackle the southern shaftfirst[258] [index_split_036.html#filepos821248]—the very shaft in which, inMarch 1993, the ‘door’ would be discovered.The initial exploration of the shaft was not as simple as Gantenbrink hadsupposed. He had to adapt to the rather oppressive conditions within the Queen’sChamber and found that manoeuvring the sturdy little robot inside the confinedspace of the narrow and steeply sloping shaft was difficult and extremely slowwork. By mid-May 1992, however, he had made considerable progress, penetratingto a depth of 70 feet. Furthermore, as he peered curiously into his monitorscreen, he could see the shaft disappearing into the deep, dark distance beyond.Where did it lead to? Was it really ‘abandoned’ as the majority of Egyptologistsmaintained,[259] [index_split_036.html#filepos821372] or did it serve some yetunknown and greater function? Hitherto Egyptologists had theorized that thisshaft would not be more than 30 feet long but now Gantenbrink had proved themwrong. What could possibly lie ahead?The desire to continue was irresistible. But at this nail-biting stage he wascalled to attend to the secondary ingredient of his project—the ‘ventilation’ ofthe Great Pyramid using the shafts of the King’s Chamber.Since these extend from the Chamber’s northern and southern walls right throughto the outside of the Pyramid, Gantenbrink was able to investigate them with amuch simpler device than that required for the Queen’s Chamber shafts. Thisdevice he named Upuaut I. Resembling a crude, miniature sledge, and mounted witha video camera, it could be hauled up and down the shafts by means of cableswith pulleys at both ends.Upuaut I could only look at the King’s Chamber shafts—where it found little ofinterest. The cleaning job was done in a quainter manner. Gantenbrink made useof an old axle from the wreck of an abandoned truck in the nearby village ofNazlet-el-Sammam, which he attached to a cable and yanked up and down the shaftsto push out the debris and sand that had piled up inside them. This done hearranged for sponsors to supply and install electric fans and then informed theGerman Archaeological Institute that he would now prepare for the continuationof his exploration of the much more promising and mysterious ‘blind-ended’shafts of the Queen’s Chamber.Upuant IIGantenbrink enthusiastically proposed to Stadelmann that he would develop aneven more powerful robot, to be named Upuaut II, in order to launch the finalassault on the cramped and inaccessible shafts. This new machine would bespecially designed to overcome the difficulties encountered by its predecessor(the prototype robot, used in early 1992, now discarded and jocularly named ‘thefather of Upuaut’) in the first attempt to explore these shafts. Upuaut II,Gantenbrink had decided, would be smaller, smarter, and much stronger. He optedto design it from scratch and to this end brought together a team of engineeringand electronic experts, mostly volunteers, in a special laboratory in Munich.What they were to come up with during the course of the next year was a marvelof the space age. The body of the robot was made of a particularly light butrobust aluminum used in aircraft components. A sophisticated laser was includedwhich could probe any small and inaccessible regions within the shaft. Hundredsof electronic components were used to form the electronic ‘brain’ and guidancesystem of the robot. Specially designed motors and gears were fitted to thefront and rear of the main body, and steel struts were added for extrastability. Even hydraulic high-pressure pistons were included, capable ofgenerating a thrust of 200 kilograms to ensure that the robot could brace itselftightly within the shaft. A new camera unit was also designed that could swivelnot only horizontally but also vertically to catch every conceivable angle ofview. Two powerful high-intensity bulbs, fitted on each side of the camera,would illuminate the way ahead. Finally a special eight-wheel drive system—fourgripping the floor and four gripping the roof of the shaft—would ensure that therobot could reach its final destination.Problems with permitsDuring the latter part of 1992 and the early part of 1993, while Upuaut II wasbeing designed and built in Munich, Rudolf Gantenbrink arranged for a televisioncrew to come with him to Egypt to film his forthcoming exploration of theQueen’s Chamber shafts. When he and the crew (including the film-maker JochenBreitenstein and an assistant, Dirk Brakebusch) arrived in Cairo on 6 March1993, however, the exploration and filming were delayed by something that atfirst appeared to be only a minor administrative problem: the GermanArchaeological Institute had not yet obtained the necessary filming permits fromthe Egyptian Antiquities Organization. When no permits were forthcoming,Gantenbrink reports that first Dr. Stadelmann and then he himself approachedZahi Hawass, the EAO’s Director-General of the Giza Pyramids, who granted‘verbal permission’ for the filming to go ahead.[260][index_split_036.html#filepos821518]Accordingly, the exploration began.DiscoveryMid-March 1993 was a crucial period for Rudolf Gantenbrink in his work insidethe Great Pyramid—all the more crucial because: (a) the whole operation had costhim a great deal of money (including $250,000 in research-and-development costsfor the robot alone); (b) it was being filmed at personal expense for acommercial documentary and (c) a deadline for the completion of the film hadbeen set for the last week of March.It was at around this time, says Gantenbrink, that Stadelmann recalled Uli Kappand withdrew the official support that the German Archaeological Institute hadpreviously accorded to the exploration of the shafts.Perhaps other men would have stopped and gone meekly home at this point.Gantenbrink is far from meek. Feeling that he was on the verge of abreakthrough, he decided that he was going to forge on—with or withoutStadelmann’s support.The crucial figure was now Zahi Hawass, whose personal authority on the siteprovided the whole ‘official’ sanction and backing for Gantenbrink’s work.However, Hawass’s undocumented ‘verbal permission’ actually counted for a greatdeal on the Giza plateau. Indeed it was as good as a signed and sealed mandateto the lowly ghafirs guarding the entrance to the Great Pyramid and was taken atface value not only by Gantenbrink and his team but also by a young inspectorfrom the EAO, Muhammad Shahy, who had been assigned to work with theGermans.[261] [index_split_036.html#filepos821642]So Gantenbrink reasoned that he would still be able to go in and out and workundisturbed in the Queen’s Chamber. This he successfully did, making rapidprogress with the robot in the exploration of both the northern and the southernshafts.Early on the morning of 21 March 1993, just before starting the day’s work asusual, he paid a visit to Zahi Hawass at his office on the Giza plateau. There,to his consternation, he learned that the Director of the Giza Pyramids had beensuspended from his post on account of an unrelated scandal concerning a missingFourth-Dynasty statue.[262] [index_split_036.html#filepos822244] (Hawass was notto be reinstated as Director of the Giza Pyramids until April 1994.)This unexpected turn of events could not have come at a more vital moment—for by21 March 1993 Upuaut II was deep inside the southern shaft of the Queen’sChamber and was, in Gantenbrink’s opinion, very close to whatever lay at theend. The exploration, however, was to go on. Destiny had fixed an amazingrendezvous for Gantenbrink on the next day, 22 March, coincidentally the springequinox.With him in the Queen’s Chamber on that fateful day were Jochen Breitenstein,Dirk Brakebusch and Muhammad Shahy.[263] [index_split_036.html#filepos822651] By10 a.m. Gantenbrink had managed to manoeuvre Upuaut II a distance of 170 feet upthe shaft. At about 180 feet a sharp settlement in the floor of the shaftcreated a dangerous obstacle that threatened to halt progress but that waseventually surmounted. Then, barely an hour later, at 11:05 a.m., after crawlinga total distance of 200 feet into the shaft, the floor and walls became smoothand polished and the robot suddenly—and one might almost say ‘in the nick oftime’—reached the end of its journey.As the first images of the ‘door’ with its peculiar metal fittings appeared onthe small television monitor in the Queen’s Chamber, Rudolf Gantenbrinkimmediately realised the massive implications of his find. This wasarchaeological history in the making[264][index_split_036.html#filepos822799]—an exciting and significant new discoveryinside the world’s most famous and most mysterious ancient monument. And it wasinteresting to note that under the lower western corner of the ‘door’ there wasa little gap beneath which the red laser spot projected by Upuaut was seen todisappear. The urge to look under the ‘door’ and see whatever might lie beyondit must have been almost unbearable. The gap, however, was far too small forUpuaut’s camera to be able to peer into. A fibre-optic lens would need to beadded if that was to be done, but rigging it would take days, perhaps evenweeks, to organize.After the initial excitement had died down, Gantenbrink’s first instinct was tomake doubly certain that the unique video images that he had been looking at onthe screen had been properly recorded. Once he was satisfied that the recordingswere excellent, he and his team packed the tapes, together with the rest oftheir gear, and returned to their base at the Movenpick Hotel.For several days after 22 March nothing happened, with no official announcementof any kind being made to the press by the German Archaeological Institute. Thereason, it seems, was that Dr. Stadelmann could not make up his mind as to whatform, exactly, such an announcement should take. During this hiatus, Gantenbrinkand the film crew decided to return to Munich. They naturally took along alltheir equipment, including the twenty-eight videotapes shot during theexploration. A few days later, at the beginning of April 1993, Gantenbrink sentus a copy of the tape showing the discovery of the ‘door’.We passed this tape on to the British media.Much ado, then nothingThe first major story appeared on the front page of the London Independent on 16April 1993:Archaeologists have discovered the entrance to a previously unknown chamberwithin the largest of Egypt’s Pyramids. Some evidence suggests it might containthe royal treasures of the Pharaoh Cheops [Khufu], for whom the Great Pyramidwas built 4500 years ago. The contents of the chamber are almost certainlyintact. The entrance is at the end of a sloping passage 65 metres long but onlyeight inches (20 cm.) wide and eight inches high ... According to the BelgianEgyptologist Robert Bauval, the passage points directly at the Dog star Sirius,held by the ancient Egyptians to be the incarnation of the goddess Isis. Othersmall passages in the Pyramid appear to point to other heavenly bodies—the Beltof Orion and the star Alpha Draconis, which at the time was in the area nowoccupied by the Pole Star ...The reaction to the Independent’s front-page splash was electrifying. Dozens ofreporters from all over the world wanted to interview Gantenbrink within hoursand that same evening Britain’s Channel 4 TV News covered the story in depth.Dr. I. E. S. Edwards made a rare appearance in this report and created somethingof a sensation by telling millions of excited viewers that ‘a statue of the kinggazing towards the constellation of Orion’ might be found behind the mysterious‘door’. ‘But it’s a wild guess—we have no precedents,’ he was quick to add.But wild guess or not, and still with no clear statement emanating from Cairo,the international media had a field day:‘PYRAMID MAY HOLD PHARAOH’S SECRETS’ ran the front page of The Age in Melbourne;‘SECRET CHAMBER MAY SOLVE PYRAMID RIDDLE’ shouted The Times in London; ‘NOUVEAUMYSTERE DANS LA PYRAMIDE’ Le Monde announced excitedly in Paris; ‘PYRAMIDMYSTERY’ reported the Los Angeles Times; ‘VIVE LA TECHNIQUE: PORTE POUR KHEOPS!’cried Le Matin in Switzerland.[265] [index_split_036.html#filepos823260]It was almost as though the cult of the Pyramid had suddenly come to life again.At any rate the story continued to run for many more weeks in dozens of regionalnewspapers and several international magazines.[266][index_split_036.html#filepos823392] Everyone, it seemed, wanted to know whatwas behind the little ‘door’, and why the Pyramid’s shafts were directed towardsthe stars ...The first official riposte came from the German Archaeological Institute,through Reuters in Germany, on 16 April 1993. Mrs. Christine Egorov,Stadelmann’s secretary—here presented as the Institutsprecherin—firmlypronounced that the very idea of a possible chamber at the end of the shaft wasnonsense. The Queen’s Chamber’s ‘air-channels’, she explained, did not head inthe direction of anything at all and the purpose of Gantenbrink’s robot had beensolely ‘to measure the humidity of the Pyramid’.[267][index_split_036.html#filepos823583]Soon afterwards, a second report went out on the Reuters wire, this time quotingDr. Stadelmann: ‘I don’t know how this story happened but I can tell you this isvery annoying,’ he fumed. ‘There is surely no other chamber ... there is no roombehind the stone.’[268] [index_split_036.html#filepos823769]Political gamesIn the years that followed Gantenbrink made repeated efforts to get hisexploration of the Queen’s Chamber shafts restarted, arguing that there was noneed to speculate as to whether or not the ‘door’ was really a door, or whetherthere might or might not be a chamber concealed behind it:I take an absolutely neutral position. It is a scientific process, and there isno need whatsoever to answer questions with speculation when questions could beanswered much more easily by continuing the research ... We have a device(ultrasonic) that would discover if there is a cavity behind the slab. It’snonsensical to make theories when we have the tools to discover the facts.’[269][index_split_036.html#filepos823884]One of the main problems that Gantenbrink faced was that he did not belong tothe Egyptological profession but was regarded by the leading academics at Gizaas a hired technician—which meant, by definition, that his views were assumed tohave no merit. He explained how, after discovering the slab-door in March 1993,he had been all but ignored and the find handled with indifference: ‘I wasscheduled to meet the Minister of Culture about the discovery, but it neverhappened. A press conference was scheduled. It never happened.’[270][index_split_036.html#filepos824005]In late 1994, Gantenbrink announced in Paris that he was willing to supply therobot to the Egyptians and even train an Egyptian technician at his own expenseso that the exploration could resume, but a few weeks later he was politelyrebuffed by the EAO’s Chairman, Dr. Nur El Din: ‘Thank you for your offer totrain the Egyptian technician [Nur El Din had written] ... unfortunately we arevery busy for the time being, therefore we will postpone the matter.’[271][index_split_036.html#filepos824091]‘The search for truth’, Gantenbrink commented in January 1995, ‘is too importantto be ruined by a silly political game. My only hope is that they will soonreach the same conclusions.’[272] [index_split_036.html#filepos824177]Breakfast with GantenbrinkOn 19 February 1995 we arrived in Egypt and the next morning had breakfast withRudolf Gantenbrink at the Movenpick Hotel in Giza.He had been in Egypt for most of the previous week, still trying to obtainpermission to resume his exploration of the Queen’s Chamber shafts, and wasreturning to Munich later that morning. During his visit, he told us, he hadfinally managed to have a face-to-face meeting with Dr. Nur El Din.‘What was the response?’ we asked.Gantenbrink shrugged his shoulders: ‘Encouraging.’ But he looked less thanencouraged.We then asked if he had been back inside the Queen’s Chamber on this visit.‘No,’ he replied, ‘I prefer not to go there.’He could not bear the thought, he told us, of returning to the site of his greatdiscovery without his robot, purposelessly, like a tourist. ‘I will go back inthe Queen’s Chamber with Upuaut and complete the exploration of the shafts,’ hesaid proudly, ‘or I won’t go back there at all.’Select groupsThat same month—February 1995—one of the most prosperous and active members ofthe Association for Research and Enlightenment spoke to us by telephone from theUnited States about plans that were in hand for furthering the quest for theHall of Records at the Giza necropolis:The next three years are going to be super years ... We sort of have ‘96 set upfor our little expedition to the Sphinx—with underground radar. 1996 was whenZahi said we’d be able to go. We’ll do more ground-scanning and most of allwe’re going to get to love and understand the people around us, and the variousgroups, and work with them ... and I figure that by ’98 we’ll hitsomething.[273] [index_split_036.html#filepos824263]We learnt in the same conversation that the same individual had been keeping aclose watch on events surrounding the hidden door in the Great Pyramid duringthe two years since Rudolf Gantenbrink’s project had ground to a halt. Heclaimed to have been informed that the Egyptian authorities would soon make anattempt to reach the door with their own robot in order to insert a fibre-opticcamera beneath it and to see whatever lies beyond. Our informant also said thathe had been invited by ‘Zahi’ to be amongst the select group of witnessespresent inside the Pyramid when this moment eventually comes: ‘He promised me aone-month’s advance notice before they do anything ... Something’s definitelygoing to happen. He’s not sure when. He had delays—I think with the robot—butthey’ll get it done ...’[274] [index_split_036.html#filepos824385]But what exactly will get done? By whom? With what motive? How certain is itthat the public will be properly informed about any further discoveries thatmight be made? And how reliable and comprehensive are the orthodox Egyptologicalinterpretations of such discoveries likely to be?One thing at any rate seems certain: Rudolf Gantenbrink, whose inventiveness anddaring led to the original discovery of the door at the end of the Queen’sChamber’s mysterious southern shaft, is unlikely to be present. In September1995 it was reported to us that the Egyptian Antiquities Organization had issuednotification to the German authorities advising that they did not wish to pursuethe exploration in the Great Pyramid.[275] [index_split_036.html#filepos824471]BurialAfter reviewing the scholarly goings on concerning the possible geologicalantiquity of the Sphinx and the ‘anomalies’ located in the bedrock beneath it,the case of the iron plate in the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber, and thecase of the relics found in the shafts of the Queen’s Chamber, we are franklynot surprised by the case of Gantenbrink’s ‘door’. Here, too, orthodox academicshave participated in the burial of research that promises new insights into theGiza monuments and—more than three years after the discovery—the ‘door’ stillremained unopened.We have no opinion as to whether or not it might lead to a ‘Hall ofRecords’—‘records’ on papyrus scrolls to do with the ‘religion’ of the buildersas Zahi Hawass speculated in 1993 during his year of absence from his post asDirector of the Giza Pyramids.[276] [index_split_036.html#filepos824603] Our ownresearch has convinced us, however, that the shaft in which Rudolf Gantenbrinkmade his remarkable discovery is linked to an archaic system of beliefs andrituals that envisaged the monuments of the Giza necropolis as an ‘image ofheaven’.In Parts III and IV we will attempt to decode this image and learn its meaning."},{"pageContent":"Part IIIDuality"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8> > The Clues of Duality‘Newton ... was the last of the magicians ... Why do I call him a magician?Because he looked at the whole universe and all that is in it as a riddle, as asecret that could be read by applying pure thought to certain evidence, certainmystic clues which God had laid about the world to allow a sort of philosopher’streasure hunt to the esoteric brotherhood. He believed that these clues were tobe found partly in the heavens ... partly in certain papers and traditionshanded down by the bretheren ... By pure thought, by concentration of mind, theriddle, he believed, would be revealed to the initiate ...’John Maynard Keynes, The Royal Society, Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 1947We saw in Parts I and II how the astronomical character of the architecture ofthe Sphinx and of the Giza Pyramids has failed to interest Egyptologists and hasnot been taken into account in their analysis of the function and significanceof the monuments. This, in our view, has resulted in a number of seriousmisinterpretations of the available evidence—perhaps the most flagrant examplesof which, at the level of physical exploration and research, have been thechronic neglect of the four astronomically aligned shafts of the Great Pyramidand the long and shocking period of inactivity over the matter of the ‘door’ inthe southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber.We hinted at the end of Part I that the logic of all these shafts, and of theground-plan and symbolism of the Pyramids and the Sphinx, appears to beconnected to certain very powerful religious and cosmological ideas set out inancient Egyptian funerary and rebirth texts and in the so-called ‘Hermetic’writings. These express the philosophy ‘as above, so below’ and advocate thedrawing down to earth of cosmic powers as an essential step in Mankind’s questfor knowledge of the divine and immortality of the soul: ‘And I, said Hermes,will make Mankind intelligent, I will confer wisdom on them, and make known tothem the truth. I will never cease to benefit thereby the life of mortal men;and then will I benefit each one of them, when the force of nature working inhim is in accord with the movement of the stars above.’[277][index_split_036.html#filepos824777]In the following chapters we will offer evidence to suggest that theextraordinary monuments of the Giza necropolis are part of a grand andlong-forgotten scheme to initiate certain select individuals, the most recent ofwhom were the Pharaohs of Egypt, into an esoteric cosmic wisdom linking earth toheaven by means of which they sincerely expected to transcend the limits ofdeath:All the world which lies below has been set in order and filled with contents bythe things which are placed above; for the things below have not the power toset in order the world above. The weaker mysteries must yield to the stronger;and the system of things on high is stronger than the things below.[278][index_split_036.html#filepos824933]Thy protector is the Star-God ... thy soul passeth on ... thy body is equippedwith power ... The doors of the hidden land are opened before thee ... Osiris,conqueror of millions of years, cometh unto thee ...[279][index_split_036.html#filepos825027]Cosmic environmentThe world view of the ancient Egyptians, which they appear to have inheritedintact and fully formed at the very beginning of their historical civilizationsome 5000 years ago, was profoundly dualistic and cosmological. The foundationof Pharaonic theocracy, the unification of the ‘Two Lands’ of Upper and LowerEgypt into one kingdom, the notions that they had of their own past andancestry, their laws and calendrical measures, the architecture of their templesand pyramid complexes, and even the land of Egypt itself and the Nile—all thesewere cosmological concepts to them. Indeed, they saw their cosmic environment(the sky, the Milky Way, the sun and the stars, the moon and the planets, andall their cycles) as being bound together in perfect duality with their earthlyenvironment (their land and the Nile, their living king and his ancestors, andthe cycles of the seasons and epochs).We suspect that the history of ancient Egypt, to the extent that it was writtendown at all in papyri and tablets and inscriptions, was frequently expressed ina kind of ‘cosmic code’ ritualistically and symbolically linked—like thePyramids themselves—to the ever-changing patterns of the sky. From this itfollows that we must look to the sky, just as the Egyptians did, if we wish tounderstand the ideas that they were trying to communicate in their (on the faceof things) extremely strange and problematic religious writings. These writingsinclude mysterious and archaic texts aimed at guiding the afterlife journey ofthe deceased, such as the Book of the Dead (which the ancient Egyptians knew asPer-Ém-Hru, the Book of ‘Coming Forth By Day’), the Book of Two Ways, the Bookof Gates, the Book of What is in the Duat and the Coffin Texts. Oldest and mostenigmatic of all these funerary and rebirth documents however, are the so-calledPyramid Texts which began to be copied and compiled from older sources in thesecond half of the third millennium BC. These remarkable records have come downto us in the form of lavish hieroglyphic inscriptions on the tomb walls of anumber of Fifth—and Sixth-Dynasty pyramids at Saqqara, some ten miles to thesouth of the Giza necropolis, and offer us a hitherto neglected key by means ofwhich the secrets of the great Pyramids and the Sphinx can be unlocked.Astronomical essenceAll the above-named documents, and many more, have been translated into modernlanguages during the past hundred years, and all have been studied byscholars—the majority of whom would not dispute that they incorporate a complexnetwork of astronomical references, symbols, allegories and allusions.[280][index_split_036.html#filepos825342] Only a handful of researchers, however,have considered the possibility that these astronomical characteristics couldconstitute the essence of the texts. In this group the late Giorgio deSantillana and Hertha von Dechend, whose study, Hamlet’s Mill, we encountered inChapter 4, have commented on the manner in which the soul of the deceasedPharaoh was thought of as having travelled through the skies:... well-equipped ... with his Pyramid Text or Coffin Text, which representedhis indispensable timetable and contained the ordained addresses of everycelestial individual he was expected to meet. The Pharaoh relied upon hisparticular text as the less distinguished dead relied upon his copy of chaptersfrom the Book of the Dead, and he was prepared to change shape into the ...semblance of whatever celestial ‘station’ must be passed, and to recite thefitting formulae to overcome hostile beings ...[281][index_split_036.html#filepos826103]Santillana and von Dechend also comment, somewhat witheringly, on the hopelessinadequacy of many of the translations that scholars work withtoday—translations which treat the astronomical aspects of the texts as thoughthey are of no particular relevance:So the elaborate instructions in the Book of the Dead, referring to the soul’scelestial voyage, translate into ‘mystical’ talk, and must be treated as holymumbo jumbo. But then, modern translators believe so firmly in their owninvention, according to which the underworld has to be looked for in theinterior of our globe—instead of in the sky—that even 370 specific astronomicalterms would not cause them to stumble.[282] [index_split_036.html#filepos826271]The problem identified here is, we will demonstrate, a large and multi-facetedone which has led scholarly analysis of the texts into a blind alley through acomplete and conspicuous neglect of: (a) the most important religious concept ofthe ancient Egyptians; (b) the most vital feature of their land and sky and (c)the most fundamental element of their spiritual and cosmological beliefs.OtherworldIn the earliest religious writings that have survived from ancient Egypt apowerful symbolic terminology is used to describe the cosmic ‘world of the dead’and its features. This world is referred to as the Duat[283][index_split_036.html#filepos826365]—a concept that is routinely translated bymodern Egyptologists as ‘the Underworld’ (or sometimes as the‘Netherworld’).[284] [index_split_036.html#filepos826571] In the Pyramid Texts,however, the Duat is clearly a location in the starry sky—as many distinguishedEgyptologists of earlier generations such as Selim Hassan, Sir E. A. WallisBudge and Kurt Sethe were undoubtedly aware.[285][index_split_036.html#filepos827004] Yet even these pioneers failed to get togrips with the full implications and characteristics of the concept because theylacked familiarity with astronomy.For example, in his analysis of the various ways in which the word Duat wasinscribed in hieroglyphic characters throughout the whole span of Egyptianhistory, Selim Hassan makes the following comment: ‘If we consider the evidenceafforded by the meaning of its name during the Old Kingdom [the Pyramid Age], weshall see that the original Duat, the future Underworld, was localized in thesky.’[286] [index_split_036.html#filepos827196] He then cites the view of KurtSethe that ‘the Duat could be either the red glow of twilight which precedes thedawn (i.e. the “false dawn”) or the spacious region in the east of the sky wherethis glow appears ...’[287] [index_split_036.html#filepos827322]Hassan goes on to quote from line 151 of the Pyramid Texts: ‘Orion has beenenveloped by the Duat; while he who lives in the Horizon (i.e. Re [the sun-god])purifies himself; Sothis [Sirius] has been enveloped by the Duat ... in theembrace of [their] father Atum.’In Hassan’s opinion: ‘This clearly shows how, as the sun rises and purifieshimself in the Horizon, the stars Orion and Sothis [Sirius], with whom the Kingis identified, are enveloped by the Duat. This is a true observation of nature,and it really appears as though the stars are swallowed up each morning in theincreasing glow of the dawn. Perhaps the determinative of the word Duat, thestar within a circle, illustrates the idea of this enveloping of the star. Whenon his way to join the stars, the dead king must first pass by (or through) theDuat which will serve to guide him in the right direction. Thus we see inUtterance 610 [of the Pyramid Texts]: “The Duat guides your feet to theDwelling-place of Orion ... The Duat guides your hand to the Dwelling-place ofOrion.” ...’[288] [index_split_036.html#filepos827420]Stars rising with the sunHassan’s assessment of the celestial landscape of the Duat is only accurate inas much as he realizes that it is in the east, that the moment of observation isthe pre-dawn (which he calls ‘false dawn’, and that the constellation of Orion(Osiris), the star Sirius (Isis), the sun (Re), and some other cosmic featurerepresenting ‘Atum’ (the ‘Father’ of the Gods), are all to be found in the Duat.Because he is not conversant with basic celestial mechanics, however, andbecause he fails to set the relevant lines from the Pyramid Texts in the contextof their time and their place, he then goes on to make a serious error ofinterpretation which has subsequently been compounded by numerous otherastronomically illiterate scholars:1. The time the Pyramid Texts were compiled was the epoch of 2800 BC to2300 BC approximately.[289] [index_split_036.html#filepos827514]2. The place of observation of the sky was just south of modern Cairo inthe so-called ‘Memphite necropolis’ (named after Men-nefer, later ‘Memphis’, thefirst historically recognized capital of ancient Egypt), where stand the greatPyramids of Giza (and also lesser Old Kingdom pyramids such as those at AbuRoash, Abusir, Saqqara, Dahshur and Meidum).[290][index_split_036.html#filepos827722]3. The error that Hassan makes is his assumption that the stars inquestion—i.e. Orion and Sirius—are swallowed up ‘each morning’ in the‘increasing glow of the dawn.’[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image034.jpg]34.

In the epoch of 2500 BC—the ‘Pyramid Age’—the Duat wasobserved and considered to be active only at the time of the summer solsticewhen the stars of Orion and Sirius rose heliacally (i.e. just ahead of the sun)at dawn.In fact there is only one time of the year when this ‘swallowing-up’ occurs—atime that slowly alters down the epochs because of the earth’s precessionalmotion. The long and the short of it is that in the Pyramid Age the specificphenomena described in the texts, and addressed by Hassan (phenomena knowntechnically as the ‘heliacal risings’ of Orion and Sirius, i.e. the risings ofthese stars just ahead of the sun at dawn) could only have been observed ataround midsummer—i.e. at the summer solstice.[291][index_split_036.html#filepos828044] The Duat, in other words, was considered bythe ancient Egyptians to be active only at the time of the summer solstice whenOrion and Sirius rose heliacally and not, as Hassan suggests, throughout theyear.With these facts in mind, let us attempt to reinterpret the cosmic Duat, thistime placing it in its proper astronomical context.Cosmic riverOne of the most salient features of the Duat, as it is described in the ancientEgyptian texts, is its relationship to a great cosmic ‘river’ called the‘Winding Waterway’. Several studies have confirmed beyond any serious doubt thatthe ‘Winding Waterway’ was the magical band of light meandering across the skythat we know as the ‘Milky Way’.[292] [index_split_036.html#filepos828327] It isalso evident that the ancient priest-astronomers who compiled the Pyramid Textsidentified the terrestrial counterpart of this ‘Winding Waterway’ in the sky asthe River Nile and its yearly flood, the ‘Great Inundation’, which also happenedto coincide with the summer solstice:[293] [index_split_036.html#filepos828455]The Winding Waterway is flooded, the Fields of Rushes are filled with water, andI am ferried over thereon to yonder eastern side of the Sky, the place where thegods fashioned me ... [Orion’s] sister is Sothis [Sirius] ...[294][index_split_036.html#filepos828662]I have come to my waterways which are in the bank of the Flood of the GreatInundation, to the place of contentment ... which is in the Horizon ...[295][index_split_036.html#filepos828788]May you lift me and raise me to the Winding Waterway, may you set me among thegods, the Imperishable stars ...[296] [index_split_036.html#filepos828903]As Sir E. A. Wallis Budge rightly observed: ‘the Egyptians ... from the earliesttimes ... depicted to themselves a material heaven [the Duat] ... on the banksof a Heavenly Nile, whereon they built cities.’[297][index_split_036.html#filepos829001] And similarly the philologist RaymondFaulkner, who translated the Pyramid Texts and much of the other religiousliterature of ancient Egypt into English, could not avoid making the obviouscorrelations between the ‘celestial river’, the ‘Winding Waterway’ and the MilkyWay.[298] [index_split_036.html#filepos829191]Kingdom of Osiris in the skyThe stars of Orion and Sirius are located on the right bank of the Milky Way,which—at the summer solstice in the Pyramid Age—would have appeared as avertical ‘cosmic river’ in the pre-dawn in the east.To the ancient Egyptians, therefore, the Duat could not possibly have been seenmerely as some vague, blank, rose-tinted region somewhere over the easternhorizon. On the contrary, it clearly had an extremely specific address in thesky—the ‘Dwelling Place’ of ‘Orion and Sirius’ on the banks of the ‘celestialNile’:Be firm O Osiris-King [Orion] on the underside of the sky with the BeautifulStar [Sirius] upon the bend of the Winding Waterway ...[299][index_split_036.html#filepos829886]Betake yourself to the Waterway ... May a stairway to the Duat be set for you tothe place where Orion is ...[300] [index_split_036.html#filepos830009]O King, you are this Great Star, the companion of Orion, who traverses the skywith Orion, who navigates [in] the Duat with Osiris ...’[301][index_split_036.html#filepos830107][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image036.jpg]36. The sky region of the Duat with the stars of Orion and Sirius risingheliacally just ahead of the sun at dawn on the summer solstice. It was at thistime of the year, and at this moment only, that the Duat was considered to be‘active’. Note that the Milky Way at this same moment appeared as a vertical‘cosmic river’ in the east. Also shown is the trajectory of the Orion starsafter their dawn rising until their culmination at the meridian.With this starry landscape in mind, we can begin to conjure up a fairly detailedimage of the Duat, the ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ in the sky—a distinct pattern ofstars, at a specific celestial location, that comes complete with its own‘cosmic Nile’.But when was this cosmic kingdom ‘founded’?‘First Time’In their most profound and beautiful religious texts, as we noted in Part I, theancient Egyptians spoke of ‘the time of the gods’, Zep Tepi (literally the‘First Time’) with the unshakeable conviction that there had indeed been such anepoch. In other words, they believed that Zep Tepi had been an actual,historical event. In line with their prevailing dualism they also believed thatit had been projected and ‘recorded’ in the catalogue of the starry sky. Indeedit was a story that was re-enacted endlessly in the cosmic setting by thecyclical displays of the celestial orbs and the constellations.What they had in mind, in other words, was a kind of cosmic ‘passion play’,expressed in the language of allegorical astronomy, in which each main characterwas identified with a specific celestial body. Re was the sun, Osiris was Orion,Isis was the star Sirius, Thoth was the moon—and so on and so forth. Nor was thedrama only confined to the celestial realms; on the contrary, as one mightexpect in dualistic ancient Egypt, it was also re-enacted on the ground, amidstthe cosmic ambiance of the astronomical Pyramids of Giza, where the events ofthe ‘First Time’ were commemorated for millennia in secret rituals andliturgies.[302] [index_split_036.html#filepos830204]Very little is known about these liturgies, or about the myths they expressed.As the Egyptologist R. T. Rundle Clark explains:The creation of the myths was founded on certain principles. These are strangeand, as yet, only partially understood. The most important element seems to havebeen as follows:(a) The basic principles of life, nature and society were determined by the godslong ago, before the establishment of kingship. This epoch—Zep Tepi—‘the FirstTime’—stretched from the first stirring of the High God in the Primeval Watersto the settling of Horus upon the throne and the redemption of Osiris. Allproper myths relate events or manifestations of this epoch.(b) Anything whose existence or authority had to be justified or explained mustbe referred to the ‘First Time’. This was true for natural phenomena, rituals,royal insignia, the plans of temples, magical or medical formulae, thehieroglyphic system of writing, the calendar—the whole paraphernalia of thecivilization ...[303] [index_split_036.html#filepos830572]Rundle Clark has also recognized that Egyptian art ‘is nearly all symbolism’,that ‘the architectural arrangements and decoration were a kind of mythicallandscape’ worked down to the last detail, and that everything had a meaning:The shrine [tomb or pyramid complex] of the god [the king], for instance, wasthe ‘Horizon’, the land of glorious light beyond the dawn horizon where the godsdwelt. The Temple was an image of the universe as it now existed and, at thesame time, the land on which it stood was the Primeval Mound which arose fromthe waters of the Primeval Ocean at Creation ... At the close of the dailytemple service, the priests raised a small figure of Maat (the goddess of Lawand Order) in front of the divine image. This act was meant to assert thatTightness and order had been re-established, but it was also a repetition of anevent that took place at the beginning of the world ... of some mythicalhappening in the time of the gods ...[304] [index_split_036.html#filepos830658]Golden Age and the entry of evilIn later chapters we shall be returning to take a closer look at this ‘FirstTime’ of the gods. Here, however, it is sufficient to note that Zep Tepi wasregarded as a mysterious and wonderful golden age that had immediately followedCreation. Furthermore, in the minds of the ancient Egyptians at least, thisgolden age had not occurred in some hard-to-find never-never land like theBiblical ‘Garden of Eden’ but in a familiar and unmistakably real physical andhistorical setting. Indeed it was their emphatic belief that the huge triangularregion just south of the apex of the Nile Delta encompassing Heliopolis, Memphisand Giza was the actual geographical location of the events of the ‘FirstTime’—a real ‘Garden of Eden’, in short, with real geographical features andplaces. It was here, amidst this sacred landscape, that the gods of the ‘FirstTime’ were said in the texts to have established their earthly kingdom.[305][index_split_036.html#filepos830750]And what was the cultural character of that Kingdom? Rundle Clark gives the bestsummary:... all that was good or efficacious was established on the principles laid downin the ‘First Time’—which was, therefore, a golden age of absoluteperfection—‘before rage or clamour or strife or uproar had come about’. Nodeath, disease or disaster occurred in this blissful epoch, known variously as‘the time of Re’, ‘the time of Osiris’, or ‘the time of Horus’ ...[306][index_split_036.html#filepos830991][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image037.jpg]37. The huge triangular region just south of the apex of the Nile Deltaencompassing Heliopolis, Memphis and Giza was regarded by the ancient Egyptiansas the actual geographical location of the events of the ‘First Time’—a sort ofgeodetic ‘Garden of Eden’ focused on astronomical latitude 30 degrees north.The gods Osiris and Horus, together with Re (in his composite form as Re-Atum,the ‘Father’ of the gods) were regarded by the ancient Egyptians as the supremeexpressions and exemplars of the ‘blissful epoch of the “First Time” ’.[307][index_split_036.html#filepos831135]Osiris they remembered in particular for having been the first to sit on thethrone of this divine Kingdom, which he ruled jointly with his consortIsis.[308] [index_split_036.html#filepos831221] The golden age of plenty overwhich the royal couple presided (during which agriculture and animal husbandrywere taught to humans and laws and religious doctrines were set for them) washowever brought to an abrupt and violent halt when Osiris was murdered by hisbrother, Seth. Left without child, Isis brought the dead Osiris back to life forlong enough to receive his seed. As a result of this union she, in due course,gave birth to Horus whose destiny it was to wrangle back the ‘kingdom of Osiris’from the clutches of his evil uncle Seth.Shabaka textsIn all its essential elements this is, of course, the story that we know asHamlet (which has a far older pedigree than the Shakespeare play[309][index_split_036.html#filepos831398]), and it is also, in its most recentHollywood manifestation, the story of the Lion King (brother murders brother,bereaved son of the murder victim takes revenge on his uncle and sets theKingdom to rights).The original Egyptian version of the story—the so-called ‘Memphite Theology’—isfound in texts inscribed on a monument known as the ‘Shabaka Stone’, now in theBritish Museum.[310] [index_split_036.html#filepos831522] Here we read how,after a great quarrel between Horus and Seth (in which Horus lost an eye andSeth a testicle) Geb, the earth-god (the father of Osiris and Isis), summonedthe Great Council of the Gods—the nine-member ‘Ennead’ of Heliopolis—and withthem passed judgement between Horus and Seth:Geb, lord of the gods, commanded the Nine Gods to gather to him. He judgedbetween Horus and Seth; he ended their quarrel. He made Seth king of UpperEgypt, up to the place in which he was born, which is Su. And Geb made Horusking of Lower Egypt, up to the place in which his father [Osiris] wasdrowned[311] [index_split_036.html#filepos832238] which is‘Division-of-the-Two-Lands’. Thus Horus stood over one region, and Seth stoodover one region. They made peace over the Two Lands at Ayan. That was thedivision of the Two Lands ...[312] [index_split_036.html#filepos832512]Let us note in passing that Ayan is not a mythical place but was an actual,physical location in ancient Egypt immediately to the north of Memphis, theEarly Dynastic capital city.[313] [index_split_036.html#filepos832744] Thejudgement that was made here was later changed, as the Shabaka Texts go on totell us:Then it seemed wrong to Geb that the portion of Horus was like the portion ofSeth. So Geb gave to Horus his [Seth’s] inheritance, for he [Horus] is the sonof his first born [Osiris] ...Then Horus stood over the two lands. He is the uniter of the Two Lands,proclaimed in the great name: Ta-tenen, ‘South-of-his-Wall’, ‘Lord ofEternity’... He is Horus, who arose as King of Upper and Lower Egypt, who unitedthe Two Lands in the [District] of the Wall [Memphis], the place where the TwoLands were united ...[314] [index_split_036.html#filepos833282]Treasure trailWhat we have in this amazing story is a sort of treasure trail of clues as tohow the ancient Egyptians themselves saw the mythical-historical transfer of the‘deeds’ or keys of the ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ to Horus by the Great Ennead and Geb.It seems clear, for example, that this momentous event was thought to have takenplace at Ayan, immediately to the north of Memphis, i.e. about 10 miles or sosouth of modern Cairo.[315] [index_split_036.html#filepos833441]And as for the dead Osiris, the Shabaka Texts tell us how the god was taken andburied ‘in the land of Sokar’:This is the land ... the burial [place] of Osiris in the House of Sokar ...Horus speaks to Isis and [her sister] Nepthys: ‘Hurry, grasp him ...’ Isis andNepthys speak to Osiris: ‘We come, we take you ...’ They heeded in time andbrought him to land. He entered the hidden portals in the glory of the Lords ofEternity. Thus Osiris came into the Earth, at the Royal Fortress, to the northof the land to which he had come. And his son Horus as king of Upper Egypt,arose as king of Lower Egypt in the embrace of his father Osiris ...[316][index_split_036.html#filepos833595]Where, what, and whose was the ‘land of Sokar’?It turns out to have been an epithet used by the ancient Egyptians to describethe extensive ‘Memphite necropolis’ incorporating the Pyramid-field of Giza.According to Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, for example: ‘The dominions of Sokar weresituated in the deserts round about Memphis and were supposed to cover a largeextent of territory.’[317] [index_split_036.html#filepos833754] I. E. S. Edwardstells us that the name ‘Sokar’ was that of ‘the god of the Memphitenecropolis’—a predynastic deity of the dead—and that ‘by Pyramid times Osirishad become identified with Sokar’.[318] [index_split_036.html#filepos833919] R.T. Rundle Clark then further complicates the picture by speaking of ‘Rostau, themodern Giza, the burial place of Memphis and the home of a form of Osiris knownas Sokar’.[319] [index_split_036.html#filepos834078]What confronts us, therefore, appears to be a linked sequence of ideas involvingOsiris, Sokar, the ‘land of Sokar’ (identified with the Memphite necropolis),and now ‘Rostau’, the ancient Egyptian name for the Pyramid-field at Giza—a namethat is in fact carved in hieroglyphs on the granite stela, which we encounteredin Part I, that stands to this day between the paws of the Great Sphinx.[320][index_split_036.html#filepos834220] That same stela also describes Giza in moregeneral terms as ‘the Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’ and speaks of theSphinx as standing beside ‘the House of Sokar’.[321][index_split_036.html#filepos834425]So the clues on the treasure trail, as well as Osiris, Sokar, the land of Sokarand Rostau-Giza, now also include the ‘House of Sokar’ and lead us back towardsZep Tepi, the ‘First Time’.Bearing all this in mind, let us return for a final look at the Memphitetheology as it is expressed in the Shabaka Texts.We find Horus firmly in possession of the earthly ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ (which hadof course been founded in the ‘First Time’) and we find the body of Osirishimself safely installed in ‘the House of Sokar’.[322][index_split_036.html#filepos834544] Under these ideal conditions, according tothe texts, the spiritualized form of Osiris was freed to depart to the sky—andto a specific location in the sky that we have already identified: ‘the placewhere Orion is’.[323] [index_split_036.html#filepos834703] There it was heldthat he had established the Duat—the cosmic ‘Otherworld’ on the right bank ofthe Milky Way—as a sort of celestial ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ for the Dead.[324][index_split_036.html#filepos834826]Sphinx godSelim Hassan actually calls the Duat ‘the Kingdom of Osiris’ and shows how‘Osiris is styled “Lord of the Duat” and the Osiris-King [i.e. the deceasedPharaoh] “a companion of Orion” ...’[325] [index_split_036.html#filepos834963]He then provides a piece of incidental information which adds to our trail ofclues when he points out, on the basis of careful textual analysis, that theDuat appears in some way to be linked to Rostau.[326][index_split_036.html#filepos835109][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image038.jpg]38. The passageways, chambers and corridors of the ‘land of Sokar’ in the FifthDivision of the Duat as depicted on tomb walls bear a close resemblance to thepassageways, chambers and corridors of the Great Pyramid. Could one of thefunctions of the Pyramid have been to serve as a kind of ‘model’ or simulationof the afterworld in which initiates underwent trials and ordeals?Like other commentators, Hassan acknowledges that ‘the name of Rostau is appliedto the Giza necropolis’.[327] [index_split_036.html#filepos835204] But he also,at various points, defines Rostau as ‘the Kingdom of Osiris in the tomb’,[328][index_split_036.html#filepos835290] and as ‘the Memphite Underworld’—i.e. theMemphite Duat.[329] [index_split_036.html#filepos835391] In this context heexamines the so-called twelve ‘Divisions’ (or ‘Hours’) of the Book of What is inthe Duat and shows that references to the ‘land of Sokar’ appear in this text.Indeed, to be a little more specific, he draws our attention to a mostintriguing fact. The land of Sokar occupies the Fifth Division of the Duat[330][index_split_036.html#filepos835486] and: ‘The centre of the Fifth Division [is]called Rostau.’[331] [index_split_036.html#filepos835581]So Egyptologists do not dispute that we have a Rostau on the ground in the formof the Pyramid-field at Giza and a Rostau in the sky in the form of the FifthDivision of the Duat—a place, as the reader will recall, that was not seen as an‘Underworld’ by the ancient Egyptians but rather as a specific celestiallocation in Orion.Furthermore, as we noted in passing in Part I, the passageways, chambers andcorridors of the land of Sokar—amply portrayed on tomb walls in survivingdepictions of the Fifth Division of the Duat—uncannily resemble the passageways,chambers and corridors of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Indeed the resemblance isso close that it is permissible to wonder whether one of the functions of thePyramid may have been to serve as a kind of model or ‘simulation’ of theafterworld in which initiates underwent trials and ordeals intended to preparethem intellectually and spiritually for the terrifying experiences andjudgements that the soul was believed to confront after death.Here, perhaps, was the testing ground for the ancient Egyptian ‘science ofimmortality’ elaborated in every utterance and vignette of the principalfunerary and rebirth texts—the purpose of which was to facilitate the journey ofthe soul through the daunting traps and pitfalls of the Duat.Additional food for thought in this regard is provided by Selim Hassan who doesnot neglect to mention that one of the distinguishing features of the FifthDivision of the Duat is the presence there of a giant ‘double-lion’ Sphinx-godnamed Aker, who seemingly protects the ‘Kingdom of Sokar’.[332][index_split_036.html#filepos835667] Hassan also points out that ‘above Aker inthis scene is a large Pyramid’.[333] [index_split_036.html#filepos835762] Hesays that this symbolism, when put in ‘conjunction with Aker in Sphinx form andthe name of Rostau’, suggests that ‘the Fifth Division was originally a[complete] version of the Duat and had its geographical counterpart in the Gizanecropolis’.[334] [index_split_036.html#filepos835857][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image039.jpg]39. The Fifth Division of the Duat features a gigantic ‘double-lion’ Sphinx-godand a large Pyramid. Compare this symbolic imagery with the Great Sphinx andGreat Pyramid seen in profile from the south-east.In support of this idea, Hassan then refers us to another of the ancientEgyptian funerary texts, the so-called Book of Two Ways, where mention is madeof ‘the Highland of Aker, which is the Dwelling Place of Osiris’ and also of‘Osiris who is in the Highland of Aker’.[335][index_split_036.html#filepos835943] Hassan suggests that ‘highland of Aker’ maybe a reference to the Giza plateau, ‘where is the earthly Rostau’.[336][index_split_036.html#filepos836029] Exactly the same idea occurred to theAmerican Egyptologist Mark Lehner in his 1974 pamphlet, The EgyptianHeritage.[337] [index_split_036.html#filepos836115] Here, after completing astudy of Rostau, he wrote: ‘it is tempting to see the lion figures of Aker as arepresentation of the Sphinx at Giza.’[338] [index_split_036.html#filepos836247]Roads of RostauThe Book of Two Ways is a text that was copied onto the floors and sides ofcoffins over a 250-year span (2050-1800 BC) during the Middle Kingdom. Accordingto the archaeo-astronomer Jane B. Sellers it was designed ‘to aid the soul ofthe deceased to pass along the roads to Rostau, the Gate in the necropolis whichgives access to the “Passages of the Netherworld” ...’[339][index_split_036.html#filepos836341]The related Coffin Texts (2134-1783 BC) shed further light on the matter whenthey state:I have passed over the paths of Rostau, whether on water or on land, and theseare the paths of Osiris, they are [also] in the limit of the sky ...[340][index_split_036.html#filepos836497]I am Osiris; I have come to Rostau to know the secrets of the Duat ...[341][index_split_036.html#filepos836702]I shall not be turned back at the gates of the Duat; I ascend to the sky withOrion ... I am one who collects his efflux in front of Rostau ...[342][index_split_036.html#filepos836815]As Sellers points out, many ancient Egyptian texts insist ‘that the topographyof Rostau, though in the sky, is on water and on land.’[343][index_split_036.html#filepos836928] She also proposes that ‘the paths by way ofwater’ could have been in that area of the sky that ‘we know as the MilkyWay’.[344] [index_split_036.html#filepos837070] This idea seems highly plausiblewhen we remember that the ‘cosmic address’ of the Duat is the ‘Kingdom of Osirisin Orion’ on the right bank of the Milky Way. The logic of ancient Egyptianduality therefore suggests that ‘the paths by way of land’ should be found atthe earthly Rostau.The earthly Rostau is the Giza necropolis,[345][index_split_036.html#filepos837156] site of the three Pyramids and theSphinx—so with all this talk of sky-ground dualities it would be almost perverseto ignore the four narrow ‘star-shafts’ which emanate skywards from the King’sand Queen’s Chambers inside the Great Pyramid.The reader will recall that the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber wasdirected at around 2500 BC to the centre of the constellation of Orion—i.e. toOrion’s belt at its ‘culmination’ or ‘meridian transit’ 45 degrees above thehorizon. Strangely, at the crucial observational moment in the predawn on thesummer solstice—crucial, at any rate, to the ancient Egyptians of the PyramidAge—computer simulations indicate that Orion was seen not at the meridian but inthe south-east, i.e. far to the left of the point in the sky targeted by thesouthern shaft of the King’s Chamber.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image040.jpg]40. Summer solstice in the epoch of 2500 BC: the Duat region. Note that Orion’sbelt at this crucial observational moment was nut at the meridian but in thesouth-east and thus far to the left of the point in the sky targeted by thesouthern shaft of the King’s Chamber. The sky seems somehow out of kilter andone has the uncomfortable feeling that the belt stars need to be drawn round tothe south, and specifically to the meridian, so that they can interlock with theshaft that targets them.Looking at the simulation, everything seems out of kilter—dislocated—and one hasthe uncomfortable feeling that the stars of Orion’s belt need somehow to bedrawn round to the south, and specifically to the meridian, so that they caninterlock with the shaft that targets them.We suspect that for the ancient Egyptians this curious and unsettling‘dislocation’ of the sky served as the stimulus for an esoteric journey whichwas undertaken on the ground by the Pharaohs themselves following celestialclues.As we shall see in subsequent chapters their quest may have been for somethingof immense importance. But in order to understand why, we must first find outwho the Sphinx is."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9> > The Sphinx and its Horizons‘The Sphinx has a Genesis, and that was the lion ...’Egyptologist Selim Hassan, The Sphinx, Cairo 1949‘[The constellation of] Leo resembles the animal after which it is named. Aright triangle of stars outline the back legs ... the front of theconstellation, like a giant backward question mark, defines the head, mane, andfront legs. At the base of the question mark is Regulus, the heart of the lion...’Nancy Hathaway, Friendly Guide to the Universe, NY 1994Even a casual review of the religious texts of the ancient Egyptians leaves nodoubt that they regarded their earthly environment as a sacred landscape whichthey had inherited from the gods. It was their absolute conviction that in theremote golden age called the ‘First Time’ Osiris had established a sort of‘cosmic kingdom’ in the Memphite region which had been passed on to his sonHorus and thence through him, down the cycles of the epochs, to subsequentgenerations of human ‘Horus-Kings’—i.e. to the living Pharaohs of Egypt.We have seen that the essence of this sacred ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ was thepeculiar dualism with which it was connected to an area of the sky known as theDuat, close to Orion and Sirius on the western side of the Milky Way. We havealso seen how the centre of the Duat was called Rostau and how Rostau, too,existed in both cosmic and terrestrial realms: in the heavens it wascharacterized by the three stars of Orion’s belt and on earth by the three greatPyramids of Giza. Last but not least, we have seen how the ancient Egyptians ofthe Pyramid Age particularly observed the Duat as it lay along the easternhorizon in the pre-dawn at the time of the summer solstice.The important word here is ‘horizon’. It will prove to be the key to the mysteryof who—or what—the Great Sphinx really represents.Celestial reflectionsWith the aid of computer simulations, and a little imagination, let us journeyto the epoch of 2500 BC, when the Pyramid Texts were compiled, and set ourlocation at Heliopolis on the observatory platform of the astronomer priests.The time of year is the summer solstice, the moment of observation is thepre-dawn, and we are looking in the general direction of the eastern horizon.This means that we have our backs turned to the Giza Pyramids which lie acrossthe Nile some twelve miles to our west.Looking east also means that we are looking at the Duat. And as our computerreconstructs the skies our eyes are drawn to that region of the Duat known asRostau which manifests the celestial counterparts of the three greatPyramids—the three stars of Orion’s belt glimmering in the pre-dawn.Having registered this image we set our direction towards the west, towards thePyramids. The bodies of the distant monuments are still cloaked in darkness butthe first hint of the rising sun lights up their capstones with an astralglimmer ...So we can see that there is a sense in which the Giza necropolis is itself akind of ‘horizon’—i.e. that its three pyramids form a reflection in the west ofthe three ‘stars of Rostau’ that observers in 2500 BC would have seen on theeastern horizon of Heliopolis in the pre-dawn at the summer solstice. Perhapsthis is precisely what was meant by an otherwise cryptic inscription on thegranite stela between the paws of the Sphinx which speaks of Giza not only asthe ‘Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’ as we have seen, but also as the‘Horizon of Heliopolis in the West’.[346] [index_split_036.html#filepos837297]Astronomer-priestsWhen the Pyramid Texts were compiled in the epoch of 2500 BC, the religiouscentre of the Pharaonic state was at Heliopolis—the ‘City of the Sun’, called Onor Innu by the ancients, which now lies completely buried under the Al Matareyasuburb of modern Cairo.[347] [index_split_036.html#filepos837450] Heliopolis wasthe earliest cult centre of the sun-god Re in his form as Atum, the ‘Father ofthe Gods’. The Heliopolitan priests were high initiates in the mysteries of theheavens and their dominant occupation was the observation and recording of thevarious motions of the sun and the moon, the planets and the stars.[348][index_split_036.html#filepos837755]Much leads us to conclude that they benefited from a vast heritage of experiencebased on such observations, accumulated over enormously long periods of time. Atany rate, the ancient Greek and Roman scholars—who were at least two millenniacloser to the ancient Egyptians than we are today—were constantly in awe at thehigh knowledge and wisdom of the Heliopolitan and Memphite priests andespecially of their astronomical science.For example, as early as the fifth century BC, Herodotus (the so-called ‘Fatherof History’) displayed great reverence for the priests of Egypt and attributedto them the discovery of the solar year and the invention of the twelve signs ofthe zodiac—which he says the Greeks later borrowed. ‘In my opinion,’ he wrote,‘their method of calculation is better than that of the Greeks.’[349][index_split_036.html#filepos837918]In the fourth century BC the learned Aristotle—who was tutor to Alexander theGreat—similarly recognized that the Egyptians were advanced astronomers ‘whoseobservations have been kept for very many years past, and from whom much of ourevidence about particular stars is derived’.[350][index_split_036.html#filepos838093]Plato, too, relates how the Egyptian priests observed the stars ‘for 10,000years or, so to speak, for an infinite time’.[351][index_split_036.html#filepos838339] Likewise Diodorus of Sicily, who visitedEgypt in 60 BC, insisted that ‘the disposition of the stars as well as theirmovements have always been the subject of careful observations among theEgyptians’ and that ‘they have preserved to this day records concerning each ofthese stars over an incredible number of years ...[352][index_split_036.html#filepos838492]Perhaps most significantly of all, the Lycian Neoplatonist, Proclus, who studiedat Alexandria in the fifth century AD, confirmed that it was not the Greeks butthe Egyptians who discovered the phenomenon of Precession: ‘Let those, whobelieve in observations, cause the stars to move around the poles of the zodiacby one degree in one hundred years [meaning the Precession rate] towards theeast, as Ptolemy and Hipparchus did before him know ... that the Egyptians hadalready taught Plato about the movement of the fixed stars ...’[353][index_split_036.html#filepos838650]Modern historians and Egyptologists, who are unanimous in the view that theEgyptians were poor astronomers,[354] [index_split_036.html#filepos838876]choose to discount such statements as frivolous outcries by misinformed Greeksand Romans. These same scholars all do accept, however, that the priestly centreat Heliopolis was already remotely ancient at the dawn of the Pyramid Age andthat it had been sacred since time immemorial to the supreme deity named Atum,the ‘Self-Created’.[355] [index_split_036.html#filepos839015]So who or what exactly was Atum?Living image of AtumAddressing the first annual meeting of the prestigious Egypt Exploration Fund on3 July 1883, the eminent Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville had this to sayabout Atum: ‘there can be no doubt that the lion or the sphinx is a form of Atum...’[356] [index_split_036.html#filepos839176]Naville went on to cite what he considered as sufficient evidence for such aconclusion:I will cite only one proof, this is the deity Nefer-Atum. This deity can berepresented with the head of a lion ... normally he has a human form, and wearson his head a lotus from which emerge two straight plumes. Sometimes the twoemblems [lion and human] are united and between the head of the lion and theplume there is the bird [hawk] of Horus.[357][index_split_036.html#filepos839359]Though initially a confusing element, we shall see that the hawk symbolism ofHorus crops up frequently in connection with this mystery and gradually beginsto take its place in the overall pattern that will emerge. Meanwhile, much elseconfirms that Atum, the primordial creator god, was regarded by the ancientEgyptians as being primarily leonine or sphinx-like in form.In the Pyramid Texts, for example, we frequently encounter the designation Rwty,normally translated as the ‘double-lion’[358][index_split_036.html#filepos839514] because the hieroglyphic sign shows twolions either side by side or one above the other.[359][index_split_036.html#filepos839608] It is generally accepted, however, that afiner meaning for the term is ‘the creature who has the form of a lion’ or ‘hewho resembles the lion’, and that the significance of the double-lion hieroglyphis that it emphasizes the dual and cosmic nature of Rwty.[360][index_split_036.html#filepos839694] The Egyptologist Le Page Renouf wrote thatRwty represents ‘a single god with a lion’s face or form’.[361][index_split_036.html#filepos839780] And for Selim Hassan ‘Rwty was a god in theform of a lion’. In Hassan’s view the choice of the double-lion hieroglyph wasvery probably linked in some way to the fact that: ‘sphinxes are always found inpairs when guarding temple door-ways, and the function of Rwty is also that of aguardian.’[362] [index_split_036.html#filepos839943]Moreover, in line 2032 of the Pyramid Texts, as Hassan points out: ‘it is saidof the King: “He is taken to Rwty and presented to Atum” ... [and] in theso-called Book of the Dead ... it says (Ch. 3, line 1): “O Atum, who appears asmaster of the lake, who shines as Rwty” ...’[363][index_split_036.html#filepos840143]Indeed, there are many such places in the texts where Rwty and Atum are linked.One typical passage states: ‘O Atum, spiritualize me in the presence of Rwty...’[364] [index_split_036.html#filepos840229] And elsewhere we read: ‘Lift upthis king’s double to the god, lead him to Rwty, cause him to mount up to Atum... The King’s rank is high in the Mansion of Rwty.’[365][index_split_036.html#filepos840377]Such syncretism with Rwty strongly supports a ‘lion-like’ or ‘sphinx-like’appearance for Atum. We should therefore not be surprised to discover that inancient Egyptian religious art Atum is often depicted as a sphinx wearing thecharacteristic headgear of this god—a tall crown with a plume and lotus.[366][index_split_036.html#filepos840503] From such depictions many leadingEgyptologists have concluded that the Great Sphinx at Giza, though allegedlybearing the face of Khafre, may also have been regarded as an image ofAtum.[367] [index_split_036.html#filepos840700] Indeed, as we saw in Part I, oneof the most enduring of the many titles by which the Sphinx was known to theancient Egyptians was Sheshep-ankh Atum (literally ‘living image of Atum’)[368][index_split_036.html#filepos840903]—so we need be in little doubt about thisidentification.Atum, Re and HorakhtiDespite all of Atum’s well-known Lion-Sphinx characteristics, modernEgyptologists have a tendency to ignore his intense leonine symbolism whendiscussing his cosmic attributes. More often than not they confine themselves todishing out certain vague generalities to the effect that Atum was the ‘sun-godand creator of the universe’, and that his name: ‘... carries the idea of“totality” in the sense of an ultimate and unalterable state of perfection. Atumis frequently called “The Lord of Heliopolis”, the major centre of sun worship.The presence of another solar deity on this site, Re, leads to a coalescence ofthe two gods into Re-Atum ...’[369] [index_split_036.html#filepos840989]Egyptologist Rosalie David informs us that at the opening of the Pyramid Age‘the god Re [or Ra] had taken over the cult of an earlier god Atum ... [thus]Re-Atum was now worshipped as the creator of the world according to theHeliopolitan theology, and his priests sought to distinguish his variouscharacteristics’.[370] [index_split_036.html#filepos841183]One of these important characteristics, Davies adds, was Re’s manifestation as‘Re-Horakhti’.[371] [index_split_036.html#filepos841384] Since the literalmeaning of Horakhti is “Horus-of-the-Horizon”,[372][index_split_036.html#filepos841470] it would seem that what we are to envisagein this latest piece of ancient Egyptian syncretism is a coalescence of thesun’s disc with such a deity. Furthermore, as astronomers and astrologers arewell aware, the disc of the sun does, in fact, ‘coalesce’ with (or ‘enter thehouse’ of) certain star groups—the twelve constellations of the zodiac—atregular intervals throughout the year. So it is reasonable to wonder whether‘Horus-of-the-Horizon’ i.e. Horakhti, could in fact be one of these zodiacalconstellations.The Egyptologist Hermann Kees also gave consideration to the subjects ofHeliopolis and Horakhti. In the light of what is about to follow, his remarksare extremely relevant: ‘The particular worship peculiar to Heliopolis was thatof the stars. From the worship of the stars evolved the worship of Re in theform of ‘Horus-of-the-Horizon ...’[373] [index_split_036.html#filepos841870]We suggest that this conclusion is in the main correct, though not quite in themanner Kees saw it. We believe that it was not merely from a general ‘worship ofthe stars’ but rather from an ancient stellar image—that of a specific zodiacalconstellation—that the composite deity Re-Horakhti was derived.Horakhti is represented in ancient Egyptian reliefs as a man with a hawk’s head,on top of which rests the solar disc.[374] [index_split_036.html#filepos842140]In this way both the god Horus (symbolized by the hawk) and the sun in the‘horizon’ are identified with the Pharaoh-King—regarded as the living embodimentof Horus.[375] [index_split_036.html#filepos842277] The Orientalist Lewis Spencenoted additionally that the lion ‘was identified to the solar deities, with thesun-god Horus [and] Re’.[376] [index_split_036.html#filepos842406] Frequently,too, we find composite lion-hawk representations of the King in ancientdepictions. For example, there is a relief from the sun-temple of Pharaoh Sahureat Abusir (Fifth Dynasty, circa 2350 BC) which shows the King as a winged lionand also as a lion with a hawk’s head.[377] [index_split_036.html#filepos842578][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image041.jpg]41. The path of the sun (the ecliptic) passing through the twelve zodiacalconstellations as they are depicted in the famous Denderah Zodiac from UpperEgypt. The sun’s disc ‘coalesces’ with (and is said to be ‘housed by’) each ofthese constellations, one after the other, month by month, during the course ofthe solar year.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image042.jpg]42. Horakhti, ‘Horus-of-the-Horizon’, was frequently depicted in ancientEgyptian reliefs as a man with a hawk’s head on top of which rests the solardisc.In summary, therefore, we seem to be looking at the various symbolic expressionsof a lengthy process: in prehistoric times a primordial god, Atum, whose formwas the lion or the Sphinx, was worshipped by the Heliopolitan priests; then, inthe Pyramid Age, Atum was ‘coalesced’ with Re, whose form was the sun’s disc,and finally with Hawk-headed Horakhti—Horus-of-the-Horizon—symbolizing theHorus-King.The result was the syncretized deity Atum-Re-Horakhti whose combined symbolismoriginated from the leonine or Sphinx-like image of Atum. Somehow this compositeor ‘coalesced’ image was then made manifest in the ‘Horizon’ in the earlyPyramid Age.In that epoch, as the reader will recall, the focus of the astronomer-priestswas on the summer solstice, when the Duat was active in the eastern sky. In whatzodiacal sign, seen on the eastern horizon, did this all important ‘coalescence’take place?Horus, Dweller-in-the-HorizonWhen Edouard Naville was excavating certain New Kingdom remains in Egypt’s deltaregion north of Cairo in 1882-3, he was struck by the fact that a large numberof the monuments he uncovered were dedicated to a composite deity he called‘Atum-Harmarchis’. Associated with these monuments there would always be a naos,or sanctuary, containing ‘a sphinx with a human head’ which Naville states was‘a well-known form of the god Harmarchis’.[378][index_split_036.html#filepos842708]We are by now familiar with Atum. But who is this ‘Harmarchis’? Naville notedthat in addition to his Sphinx form he was often represented as ‘a god with ahawk’s head, or as a hawk with a solar disc’—symbols with which we are alsofamiliar—and that ‘Atum-Harmarchis was the god of Heliopolis, the most ancientcity of Egypt’.[379] [index_split_036.html#filepos842857]‘Harmarchis’ is a Graecianized rendering of the ancient Egyptian name,Hor-em-Akhet, which means ‘Horus-in-the-Horizon’ or‘Horus-Dweller-in-the-Horizon’.[380] [index_split_036.html#filepos842943] Inother words, as should be obvious by now, it is a concept that is extremelyclose to Horakhti, or ‘Horus-of-the Horizon’—as close, at any rate, as thenuance between ‘of on the one hand and ‘in’ on the other ...Both deities are called horizon-dwellers. Both are sometimes depicted as a manwith the head of a hawk. Both have a solar disc on their heads.[381][index_split_036.html#filepos843285] Indeed there is no real difference betweenthem at all except, as we shall see, in the nature of the ‘Horizon’ in whichthey are said to dwell.There is one other thing about Hor-em-Akhet and Horakhti, however, that we needto take account of first. The names of these curiously composite and syncretizedlion-hawk-solar deities were both frequently, directly and interchangeablyapplied to the Great Sphinx at Giza.The ‘Two Horizons’ of HeliopolisThe earliest surviving references to Hor-em-Akhet date from the New Kingdom,circa 1440 BC, and are found on a limestone stela of Pharaoh Amenhotep II, thebuilder of a small temple that can still be seen on the north side of the Sphinxenclosure. On the stela Amenhotep makes reference to the ‘Pyramids ofHor-em-Akhet’ which Selim Hassan takes as a sign, ‘that he considered the Sphinxto be older than the Pyramids’.[382] [index_split_036.html#filepos843447] Hassanalso notes that the stela specifically names the Great Sphinx both asHor-em-Akhet and as Horakhti.[383] [index_split_036.html#filepos843577][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image043.jpg]43. Artist’s impression of ‘reconstructed’ Sphinx showing south profile.In a similar vein, in line 9 of its inscription, the granite stela of ThutmosisIV—which stands between the paws of the Sphinx—refers to the Sphinx itself as‘Hor-em-Akhet-Khepri-Re-Atum’ and subsequently, in line 13, as‘Atum-Hor-em-Akhet’,[384] [index_split_036.html#filepos843663] but also refersto Thutmosis as the ‘Protector of Horakhti’.[385][index_split_036.html#filepos843816] And it is on this same stela, as the readerwill recall, that Giza is described as ‘the “Horizon” [Akhet] of Heliopolis inthe West’—i.e. as a ‘reflection’ in the West of what viewers in Heliopolis wouldhave seen on their eastern horizon in the pre-dawn of the summer solstice.It may also be of relevance that the son of Thutmosis IV, Amenhotep III, isremembered in ancient Egyptian annals as having built a temple in honour ofRe-Horakhti, and that Amenhotep’s son, the notorious and enigmatic PharaohAkhenaten, raised a great obelisk at Luxor in honour of Re-Hor-em-Akhet.[386][index_split_036.html#filepos843902] Akhenaten was also to name his famoussolar-city Akhet Aten, the ‘Horizon of the sun disc’.[387][index_split_036.html#filepos844028] And as Selim Hassan points out the Aten orsun disc was frequently identified by the ancient Egyptians with the image ofthe Sphinx.[388] [index_split_036.html#filepos844114] Last but not least, whenAkhenaten ascended the throne of Egypt he chose as his most prominent epithetthe impressive title of ‘High priest of Re-Horakhti’.[389][index_split_036.html#filepos844245]It is therefore legitimate to inquire into what exactly is meant by the term‘Horizon’ (Akhet) in the names Hor-em-Akhet and Horakhti. Are these twin beingsknown as Horus-in-the-Horizon and Horus-of-the-Horizon to be associated with thecelestial horizon—where sky meets land? Or are they to be associated with the‘Horizon’ of Heliopolis in the West, i.e. the Giza necropolis?Or is it not more likely that the texts are prompting us to consider two‘horizons’ at the same time?Interestingly, Egyptologists often translate the names Hor-em-Akhet and Horakhtias meaning ‘Horus-of-the-Two-Horizons’. Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, for example,identifies Re-Horakhti to Re-Harmarchis [Hor-em-Akhet] and translates both namesas ‘Ra + Horus-of-the-Two-Horizons’.[390] [index_split_036.html#filepos844371]Likewise the orientalist Lewis Spence writes: ‘Horus-of-the-Two-Horizons, theHarmarchis [Hor-em-Akhet] of the Greeks, was one of chief forms of the sun-god... thus we find Harmarchis worshipped principally at Heliopolis ... hisbest-known monument is the famous Sphinx, near the Pyramids of Giza.’[391][index_split_036.html#filepos844555]So if Hor-em-Akhet is the Great Sphinx in the western ‘Horizon of Giza’, thenshould we not look for Horakhti, his ‘twin’, in the eastern horizon of the sky?These are questions that we shall continue to pursue. Meanwhile, as EgyptologistAhmed Fakhry confirms, the various stelae that we have reviewed, and numerousother inscriptions, leave no doubt that the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt knew andworshipped the Sphinx (and obviously, too, his celestial counterpart) under thenames Hor-em-Akhet and Horakhti.[392] [index_split_036.html#filepos844680]Fakhry also points out something else of relevance: both names are ‘appropriate’since ‘the ancient necropolis [of Giza] was called Akhet Khufu, the “Horizon” ofKhufu’.[393] [index_split_036.html#filepos844813]Strange silenceBecause the earliest surviving texts containing the term Hor-em-Akhet date fromthe New Kingdom, it is the present consensus of scholars that the ancientEgyptians of the Old Kingdom never spoke of the Sphinx. According to JaromirMalek of Oxford University, for example: ‘Old Kingdom sources are strangely andsurprisingly silent about the Great Sphinx of Giza. It was only some 1000 yearsafter the Sphinx had been made ... that it was mentioned ...’[394][index_split_036.html#filepos844899]Could this really be so? How could the Old Kingdom Egyptians, having taken thetrouble to construct the huge Giza necropolis and the rest of the Memphitemonuments, fail to make any mention of the Great Sphinx?One possibility which deserves to be taken seriously is that they did notmention it because they did not build it—but rather inherited it from a farearlier epoch. Even on this scenario, however, it strains credulity to suppose,in all their prolific texts, carved on the walls of nine royal Pyramids of theFifth and Sixth Dynasties, that they would not make a single reference to somagnificent a statue occupying so crucial a site.The other possibility which has to be considered, therefore, is thatEgyptologists could somehow have failed to recognize the name given to theSphinx in the Pyramid Texts.There is one very obvious contender.As we have seen, the Sphinx in the New Kingdom was known not only asHor-em-Akhet but also as Horakhti. And although the name Hor-em-Akhet definitelydoes not appear in the Pyramid Texts it is a simple fact that the name Horakhtidoes, many times over. Indeed these archaic scriptures contain hundreds ofdirect mentions of Horakhti, ‘Horus-of-the-Horizon’,[395][index_split_036.html#filepos845054] all of which refer, as scholars agree, ‘tothe god rising in the east at dawn’.[396] [index_split_036.html#filepos845174]What they have never suspected is the possibility that they may be confrontedhere by the ancient Egyptian dualistic way of referring to an earthlycounterpart by means of its celestial twin.Searching for Horakhti‘The doors of the sky are thrown open for Horakhti,’ states one typical passagein the Pyramid Texts, ‘the doors of the sky are thrown open at dawn for Horus ofthe East ...’[397] [index_split_036.html#filepos845334] Elsewhere, in line 928,we read: ‘go to ... Horakhti at the horizon ... I go up on this eastern side ofthe sky ...’[398] [index_split_036.html#filepos845459]Virtually unnoticed by Egyptologists, who write off all such utterances as‘mystical mumbo-jumbo’, the Pyramid Texts also provide us with some extremelyimportant astronomical clues when they tell us, again and again, that the dawnrising of Horakhti in the east coincides with the time and place ‘where the godswere born’. For example:The Winding Waterway is flooded, the Fields of Rushes are filled, that I may beferried over to the eastern side of the sky, to the place where the gods wereborn, and I was born there with them, as Horus, as the Horizon Dweller[Horakhti] ...[399] [index_split_036.html#filepos845559]... go to ... Horakhti at the horizon ... on the eastern side of the sky wherethe gods are born.[400] [index_split_036.html#filepos845659]... the birth of the gods before you [Horus] in the five epagomenal days...[401] [index_split_036.html#filepos845759]Making use of the proper astronomical key, let us try to decode this alleged‘mystical mumbo-jumbo’:1. The ‘place where the gods [i.e. the stars] are born’ is a specificdirection as to where we are to observe Horakhti: the eastern horizon—where allheavenly bodies rise.2. The time of year at which we are to make our observations is alsoclearly specified: the so-called ‘five epagomenal days’, or five ‘days upon theyear’. To understand this reference we need only remember that the ancientEgyptian calendar was based on 360 days plus five extra or intercalcary dayswhich they called ‘the days upon the year’ (epagomenae in Greek). During thesefive days five Neters or gods were said to have been born, two of whom—Osirisand Isis—were identified by the ancient Egyptians with the constellation ofOrion and the star Sirius (also called Sothis).3. Last but not least the Pyramid Texts also specify the time of day atwhich the sky is to be observed—clearly dawn, since this was when the birth ofthe gods was said to have occurred:Behold Osiris has come as Orion ... the dawn-light bears you with Orion ... yourthird is Sothis [Sirius] ...’[402] [index_split_036.html#filepos845857]Sothis [Sirius] is swallowed up [i.e. fades in the dawn] by the Duat, pure andliving in the Horizon.[403] [index_split_036.html#filepos845954]The reed-floats of the sky are brought down to me ... that I may go up on themto Horakhti at the horizon. I go up on this eastern side of the sky where thegods are born, and I am born as Horus, as ‘Him of the Horizon’ ... Sothis is my[companion] ...[404] [index_split_036.html#filepos846051]The sky is clear [is lighting up], Sothis lives ...[405][index_split_036.html#filepos846152]It is Sothis ... who prepares yearly sustenance for you in her name of ‘Year’...[406] [index_split_036.html#filepos846249]Geographical and cosmological contextThe day on which Sothis-Sirius, after a period of invisibility, was first seenrising with the sun at dawn (i.e. the event referred to by astronomers as the‘heliacal rising’ of this star) was taken by the ancient Egyptians as the cosmicmarker for the beginning of their New Year.Furthermore it is certain from the passages quoted above, and from many otherreferences in the Pyramid Texts, that the dawn rising of Sothis-Sirius coincidedwith the rising of ‘Horakhti’. This is an important piece of astronomicalinformation which helps us to identify who Horakhti is—or rather which celestialfigure he represents.We also know from historical records and from computer reconstructions that twomajor events—one celestial and the other terrestrial—coincided with the heliacalrising of Sirius during the Pyramid Age (circa 2500 BC). The celestial event wasthe summer solstice. And the terrestrial event, as the reader will recall fromthe previous chapter, was the start of the Nile’s annual flood—the ‘GreatInundation’ that brought fertility to the land.[407][index_split_036.html#filepos846346]Once this geographical and cosmological context is fully taken into account wecan see exactly what it is that the compilers of the Pyramid Texts weretransposing from the ground to the sky when they tell us that the appearance ofHorakhti at dawn coincided in their epoch with the start of the ‘great flood’:The Winding Waterway is flooded, that I may be ferried thereon to the horizon,to Horakhti ... Re has taken me to himself, to the sky, to the eastern side ofthe sky, as this Horus, as the Dweller in the Duat, as this star which illuminesthe sky [which] is my sister Sothis ...[408][index_split_036.html#filepos847074]This is Horus who came forth from the Nile ...[409][index_split_036.html#filepos847189]They row Horus, they row Horus in the procession of Horus on the Great Flood.The doors of the sky are opened, the doors of the firmament are thrown open forHorus of the East at dawn ...[410] [index_split_036.html#filepos847287]Also passage 1172 speaks of ‘the Great Flood which is in the sky’ in the regionof the Duat.So, to summarize, far from being ‘mumbo-jumbo’, the Pyramid Texts go to greatlengths to make it clear that during the epoch of their compilation, circa 2500BC, the rising of Horakhti at dawn coincided with the summer solstice, and withthe season of the inundation, at the moment when the Duat—the celestial Kingdomof Osiris-Orion—occupied the eastern portion of the sky. We can also deduce fromthe texts that Re, i.e. the sun’s disc, was seen somehow to merge or to unite—or‘coalesce’—with Horakhti at the same time. This is made amply clear by thefollowing reading: ‘Re has taken me to himself to the eastern side of the sky asthis Horus, as the “Dweller in the Duat”.’[411][index_split_036.html#filepos847388]In other words, what we need to look for in order to identify Horakhti withcertainty is an astronomical conjunction during the summer solstice in thePyramid Age when both the sun and some other significant celestial body wouldhave been seen to occupy the same specific place on the eastern horizon.As we shall see in the next chapter, computer simulations provide us with themeans to search for such a conjunction. They also enable us to relive the dramaof the Horus-Kings of ancient Egypt as they participated in an extraordinaryritual, physically re-enacting celestial events observed by the astronomerpriests of Heliopolis on their eastern horizon and reflected in the artificialwestern ‘Horizon’ of Heliopolis, i.e. amongst the vast and eternal monuments ofthe Giza necropolis."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10> > The Quest of the Horus-King‘Egypt ... considered life to be everlasting and denied the reality of death ...Pharaoh was not mortal but a god.

These gods are the late kingand his successor; these kings are those gods ...’Henri Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, 1948The whole force, the impetus and the very raison d’être of the Pharaonic statewas to provide all the required ceremonial settings that would enable theHorus-King to undertake a sort of supernatural quest—a journey back in time intothe earthly and cosmic realms of his ‘father’ Osiris. Indeed this was thesupreme quest in a Pharaoh’s lifetime and at its end lay the ultimate Holy Grailin the form of the astral body of Osiris which the king could encounter onlyafter overcoming many dangers, difficulties and ordeals and after passingthrough many miracles and terrors. Once in the presence of Osiris the questorwould beseech him to ‘rise again’ and bestow immortality not only on himself,but on the whole land of Egypt. This great ritual had to be performed by eachsuccessive Horus-King, (perhaps even each year) at a specific time preluding the‘rising of Orion’.Child of the Sun, son of OsirisIn his brilliant study on the Osirian cosmic myth,[412][index_split_036.html#filepos847485] the late professor of Egyptology atManchester University, R. T. Rundle Clark, wrote that: ‘The king was themediator between the community and the source of divine power, obtaining itthrough the ritual and regularizing it through his government. In Egypt therewere two sources of power—in the sky and in the tomb with the ancestors. Thefirst location made the king the child of the Sun God; the second location madehim Horus, the son of Osiris ...’[413] [index_split_036.html#filepos847635]Let us reiterate this important dualistic quality of the Horus-King—’the childof the Sun God and the son of Osiris’—for in it lies the true mystery of thegreat Osirian and Horian rituals of the Pyramid Age. The potential powers ofnature within the ‘dead’ Osiris remained ‘inert, asleep or listless, andcompletely passive’ until the Horus-King was able to undertake a ‘journey’ tothe Duat and ‘visit his father’ and ‘open his mouth’, i.e. bring him back tolife.[414] [index_split_036.html#filepos847730] This final and supreme act offilial devotion would then release all the forces of nature which would in turnbring forth the flooding of the Nile and the growth of vegetation—the forces, inshort, that would fertilize and regenerate Egypt. In Rundle Clark’s words:‘Theologically, the result of Horus’s ministration is that Osiris can “send outhis soul” or “set himself in motion” ... The time of Orion in the southern skyafter the time of its invisibility is the sign for the beginning of a new seasonof growth, the revival of nature in all aspects. Osiris has been transformedinto a “living soul” ...’[415] [index_split_036.html#filepos847828]Sir E. A. Wallis Budge also explains how, from its earliest beginnings, thePharaonic state was entirely committed to provide the correct ceremonial settingfor each successive Horus-King to be able to perform the ‘journey’ into the Duatto visit the twofold realm of Osiris in the ‘horizon’:[The Egyptians] spared no pains in performing the works which they thought wouldhelp themselves and their dead to put on immortality and to arrive in thedominions of him who was ‘the King of eternity and the lord of everlastingness’.Every tradition which existed concerning the ceremonies that were performed onbehalf of the dead Osiris by Horus and his ‘sons’ and ‘followers’, at someperiod which even so far back as the IVth Dynasty ... was extremely remote, wascarefully preserved and faithfully imitated under succeeding dynasties ... Theformulae which were declared to have been recited during the performance of suchceremonies were written down and copied for scores of generations ...’[416][index_split_036.html#filepos847923]The whole emphasis on the King’s person, therefore, was that he was seen as thelink between the two Duals, one in the sky and the other on land, both meant tocontain the ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ as it was in the original ‘First Time’. Thegreat ‘journeys’ of Horus thus took place both in the sky and on the ground andran, as it were, in parallel. This is how the drama seems to have beenconceived:1. In the sky the Horus-King was the ‘son of the Sun’ and had to followthe path of the sun disc, cross the ‘cosmic river’ on the Solar-bark and reachthe Gateway that lead into the sky-Duat of his ‘father Osiris’ in the easternhorizon.[417] [index_split_036.html#filepos848104] He then had to travel on oneof the ‘roads’ to Rostau, the centre of the Duat, where (then and now) are to befound the three stars of Orion’s belt.2. On the ground the Horus-King was the bodily ‘son of Osiris’ and had tofollow the earthly path, cross the Nile on the solar boat and reach the Gateway(the great Sphinx) that led into the earth-Duat of his ‘father Osiris’ in thewestern ‘horizon’, i.e. the necropolis of Giza. He then had to travel on one ofthe ‘roads’ to Rostau, the centre of the Duat, where (then and now) are to befound the three great Pyramids of Giza.In both these ‘journeys’ the Horus-King somehow had to be able to pass through asort of ‘time gateway’ which permitted him to enter the twofold Duat realms ofOsiris—i.e. Rostau-Giza—as they were remembered from the mythical golden age ofthe gods:[The council says to Horus]: Indeed this journey of yours ... is as when [thefirst] Horus went to his father Osiris so that he might be a spirit thereby,that he might be a soul thereby ...[418] [index_split_036.html#filepos848237]Indeed this journey of yours, indeed these journeys of yours [sky and land] arethe journeys of [the first] Horus in search of his father Osiris ...[419][index_split_036.html#filepos848335]From such references it is quite obvious that the events catalogued in the skyand on the land in the ‘twofold funeral regions of Osiris’ are somehow set or‘frozen’ far back in the past in ‘the time of the gods’, the time of Osiris andHorus—i.e. Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’.Also obvious, as we have seen in previous chapters, is the way in which thetwofold funeral regions of Osiris are said to reflect each other at the time ofthe heliacal rising of Sirius, the ‘star of Isis’, the sister-wife of Osiris andmother of Horus—an astronomical event which we know coincided in the earlyPyramid Age with the appearance of the rising sun at the summer solstice (knownas the ‘birth of Re’).[420] [index_split_036.html#filepos848433] It was at thispropitious moment that the Horus-King set out on his quest for the regenerationof Egypt by participating in a grand rebirth ritual simultaneously as the ‘sonof Osiris’ and the ‘son of Re’.As the ‘son of Osiris’ he emerged from ‘the womb of Isis’, i.e. the starSirius,[421] [index_split_036.html#filepos848581] at dawn on the summersolstice, i.e. the day of the ‘Birth of Re’. It was then—and there—both at thesky-horizon and on the earth ‘horizon’ that the Horus-King was meant to findhimself in front of the Gateway to Rostau. Guarding that Gateway on theearth-horizon’ (i.e. at Giza) he would encounter the gigantic figure of alion—the Great Sphinx. And guarding that Gateway in the sky-horizon hiscelestial counterpart would find ... what?As usual, once we understand their profoundly astronomical nature, the PyramidTexts provide us with all the necessary co-ordinates to answer this question. Itis simply a matter of realizing that the ‘weird’ symbolic language used in thetexts—far from being mumbo-jumbo—is in fact a precise scientific terminologydressed up in the liturgical clothing of a cosmic drama.[422][index_split_036.html#filepos848762]Seventy days from HorakhtiIt is well known, and not a matter of controversy even amongstEgyptologists,[423] [index_split_036.html#filepos848889] that the whole emphasisof the ancient Egyptian rebirth cult was on the seventy days of ‘invisibility’which Sirius, the star of Isis, endured each year. These seventy days were seenas a cosmic preparation for astral rebirth and, not surprisingly, they werematched to the period of embalming in the mummification rituals of thedead.[424] [index_split_036.html#filepos849183] The culmination and crescendo ofthis seventy-day period came with the first dawn reappearance, or rising, ofSirius which, as the reader will recall, occurred at around the time of thesummer solstice during the Pyramid Age. This was when the astronomer-priests ofHeliopolis observed what is technically known as the heliacal rising of Siriusin the east.[425] [index_split_036.html#filepos849269]Since it was believed that all the potential powers of nature needed to causethe ‘rebirth’ of the cosmic Horus-King were building up in the ‘womb’ of thegoddess Isis during these crucial seventy days, we can suppose that thebeginning of the period marked the beginning of the ‘journey’ of Horus into the‘underworld’—when the Duat was locked, as it were, below the horizon and thusdirectly ‘underneath’ the Giza necropolis.From this it follows that we are invited to find out where the Horus-King’scelestial counterpart—i.e. the disc of the sun—stood in the sky some seventydays prior to the heliacal rising of Sirius. The Pyramid Texts again give us theclue. They specify that at this time the Horus-solar-King was to be found on thebanks of the Milky Way just about to board the solar bark.[426][index_split_036.html#filepos849742] Remembering that the astronomicalobservations in the texts were made during the middle of the third millenniumBC, let us try to decode this imagery using computer simulations.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image044.jpg]44. Position of the Duat sky-region at dawn at various times of the year in theepoch of 2500 BC, the Pyramid Age. The Duat was considered to become active onlyat the summer solstice in mid-June when the stars of Orion and Sirius roseheliacally. Some 70 days prior to this crucial observational moment the Duat was‘locked’ below the horizon and thus, in a sense, directly ‘underneath’ the Gizanecropolis.We know, of course, that the ‘path’ of the sun (which astronomers call theecliptic) passes through twelve distinct constellations in the course of acomplete year—the constellations of the zodiac. Circa 2500 BC, therefore, let ussee where the sun would have been along the ecliptic path some seventy daysbefore the heliacal rising of Sirius. It would, we discover, have been near thehead of Taurus (the Hyades) and poised on the right bank of the Milky Way.[427][index_split_036.html#filepos849875]In the ritual or drama performed by the king, is it not possible that thiscelestial event was the source of the imagery of the cosmic Horus about to‘board’ a cosmic ‘bark’ with the sun-god in order to cross a waterway (the‘Winding Waterway’, i.e. the Milky Way):[428][index_split_036.html#filepos850174]The king embarks with Re on this great bark of his, he navigates in it to thehorizon with him ...[429] [index_split_036.html#filepos850474]The king shall go aboard the bark like Re on the banks of the Winding Waterway...[430] [index_split_036.html#filepos850597]The Winding Waterway is flooded ... you cross thereon to the horizon, to theplace where the gods were born ... your sister [companion] is Sothis ...[431][index_split_036.html#filepos850695]May you cross the Winding Waterway ... may you fall in the eastern side of thesky, may you sit in the ... horizon ...[432][index_split_036.html#filepos850796]He [Horus] goes aboard the bark like Re at the banks of the Winding Waterway...[433] [index_split_036.html#filepos850894]As we wind the ancient skies a little forward in time on our computer wediscover that twenty-five days after being stationed near the Hyades-Taurus onthe right bank of the cosmic river the sun has indeed ‘crossed’ the Milky Wayand is now ‘sailing’ eastwards along the ecliptic path in the direction of thegreat zodiacal constellation of Leo—seen as a huge ‘crouching lion’ in the sky.We are now just a little over six weeks away from the summer solstice:The reed-floats of the sky are set down for me that I may cross on them to thehorizon, to Horakhti ... to yonder eastern side of the sky ... Summons is madeto me by Re ... as Horus, as the Horizon Dweller ...[434][index_split_036.html#filepos850992]The doors of the sky are thrown open for Horakhti ... the doors ‘of the sky arethrown open at dawn for Horus of the East ...[435][index_split_036.html#filepos851092]... go to ... Horakhti at the horizon ... on the eastern side of the sky wherethe gods are born.[436] [index_split_036.html#filepos851192]Following this extremely clear and specific instruction to ‘go to Horakhti’ atthe horizon (there to meet the sunrise) we continue our eastward journey alongthe ecliptic path with a sense that we are rapidly converging upon a vital‘station’ in the quest of the Horus-King.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image045.jpg]45. Epoch of 2500 BC, the Pyramid Age, seventy days before the summer solstice:an initiate tracking the journey of the ‘solar’ Horus, the disc of the sun, fromits station on the right ‘bank’ of the Milky Way.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image046.jpg]46. Epoch of 2500 BC, the Pyramid Age: an initiate tracking the journey of the‘solar’ Horus, the disc of the sun, to its conjunction with Regulus, theheart-star of Leo, at dawn on the summer solstice. The ritual leaves no room fordoubt that the enigmatic figure of Horakhti, so frequently referred to in thePyramid Texts, is none other than the constellation of Leo.The weeks pass in seconds on our computer screen and when we at last ‘reach theeastern side of the sky’—at the horizon, at the highly significant moment when‘the gods are born’, i.e. at the exact time of rising of the star Sirius—we seethat a very powerful celestial conjunction has occurred: the sun (which is nowat the summer solstice point) stands exactly between the ‘paws’ of Leo.[437][index_split_036.html#filepos851292] The solar disc is positioned near thebreast of the cosmic lion where it seems to merge with the bright starRegulus—the ‘star of Kings’.[438] [index_split_036.html#filepos853582]The great celestial ‘journey’ performed by the cosmic Horus-King along theecliptic path therefore turns out to lead quite unambiguously to one veryspecific place in the heavenly landscape: between the ‘paws’ of Leo and right infront of its ‘breast’.The implications are obvious.The enigmatic figure of Horakhti, whose identity we have been attempting toestablish, can be none other than the constellation of Leo—the giant cosmiclion, or sphinx, who stands at the gates of the sky-Duat and who assumes thename of ‘Horus-of-the-Horizon’.Let us now transpose the Horus-King to the land and follow his journey to theearthly ‘Horus-in-the-Horizon’—by whom, of course, we mean Hor-em-Akhet, theGreat Sphinx in the ‘horizon’ of Giza.The High Road and the Low RoadThe Horus-King stands on the east bank of the Nile, near the royalresidence.[439] [index_split_036.html#filepos854087] After completing certainrituals he boards a great ‘solar boat’[440][index_split_036.html#filepos854176]—perhaps the very boat that was found in1954 buried in a pit near the south face of the Great Pyramid—and is taken tothe west bank of the river in the valley beneath the Giza plateau. Hedisembarks, makes his way up to the Temple of the Sphinx, and walks between thepaws of the great statue to stand in front of its breast.He is now at the Gateway to Rostau[441] [index_split_036.html#filepos854652] andabout to enter the Fifth Division of the Duat—the holy of holies of the Osirianafterworld Kingdom. Moreover, he is presented with a choice of ‘two ways’ or‘roads’ to reach Rostau: one which is on ‘land’ and the other in ‘water’.[442][index_split_036.html#filepos855117][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image047.jpg]47. The ‘astral’ Kingdom of Osiris in Rostau. Artist’s impression of thecorrelation of the three Giza Pyramids and the three stars of Orion’s belt inZep Tepi, the ‘First Time’.The eminent German philologist, Adolf Erman, explains:Whoever enters the realms of the dead by the sacred place of Rostau has, as welearn from a map of the Hereafter, two routes open to him, which would lead himto the land of the blessed, one by water, the other by land. Both are zigzag,and a traveller cannot change from one to the other, for between them lies a seaof fire ... Also before entering upon either of these routes there is a gate offire to be passed ...[443] [index_split_036.html#filepos855295]Having made his choice, the Horus-King demands to be taken to see ‘his father’Osiris in his astral form. A mediator or priest reports to Osiris and states:It is not I who asks that he may see you in this form of yours which has comeinto being for you; O Osiris, someone asks that he may see you in this form ofyours which has come into being for you; it is your son who asks ... it is Horuswho asks that he may see you in this form ... a loving son ...[444][index_split_036.html#filepos855390][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image048.jpg]48.

At this vital juncture, the questor’s role is to bidhis ‘father Osiris’ to awake and be reborn—i.e., in dualistic astronomicalterms, to rise anew in the east at dawn as Orion: ‘Awake for Horus! ... Raiseyourself! ... The gates of the Duat are opened for you ... Spiritualize yourself... May a stairway to the Duat be set up for you to the place where Orion is...’[450] [index_split_036.html#filepos856171]Where, then, near or under the Sphinx can we find the ‘two ways’ or the ‘tworoads’ of Rostau?And why should the Horus-King be made to choose between them?Subterranean worldOne of the ancient names of the Giza necropolis, as we have seen, was AkhetKhufu—Kherit-Neter-Akhet-Khufu in full, usually rendered into English as ‘thenecropolis of the Horizon of Khufu’. In his dictionary of ancient Egyptianhieroglyphs, Sir E. A. Wallis Budge translates the word Kherit-Neter as‘cemetery, necropolis’.[451] [index_split_036.html#filepos856298] Selim Hassan,however, points out that Kherit-Neter can have the alternative meaning of‘under, or belonging to a God’.[452] [index_split_036.html#filepos856469] AndBudge adds that Kherit can also mean ‘estate’ and that the root of the word,i.e. Kher, can mean ‘under something’, ‘the lower part’ or ‘downwards’.[453][index_split_036.html#filepos856609]In addition, as Hassan also reminds us, Kherit ‘may be applied to the Underworld[Duat], perhaps as a lingering memory of the conception of Rostau as the Kingdomof Osiris in the tomb’.[454] [index_split_036.html#filepos856755] Could suchnuances imply more than a lingering memory? In other words, is it not possible,as we have already suggested in Part I, that under the necropolis-‘horizon’ ofGiza there could be an ‘estate’ of some kind—perhaps a network of subterraneanchambers and passageways?In his Handbook of Egyptian Religion, the German Egyptologist Adolf Erman wrotethat: ‘the celebrated shrine Rostau, the gates of the ways, led directly to theunderworld. It is possible that part of this shrine has survived in theso-called Temple of the Sphinx ...’[455] [index_split_036.html#filepos856895]Furthermore, commenting on the word ‘Rostau’, R. O. Faulkner, the translator ofthe Pyramid Texts, says that this is also ‘the term for a ramp or slide formoving the sarcophagus into a tomb, transferred to a region of the beyond’.[456][index_split_036.html#filepos857058] Dr. I. E. S. Edwards, on the other hand,says that the causeway which links a pyramid complex with its valley temple ‘wascalled “place of the haul” or “entrance of the haul” (Rostau) because it was theway along which sledges bearing the body of the dead king and his personalpossessions would be hauled at his funeral’.[457][index_split_036.html#filepos857187]Linking the Valley Temple near the Sphinx with the central Pyramid on the Gizaplateau, as the reader will recall, are the remains of an enormous causeway.Might not this causeway or ‘road’ be one of the ‘ways’ to the heartland ofRostau described in the ancient texts? Such causeways—though now in all casesfallen into ruin—were originally rectangular tunnels roofed over with limestoneslabs and decorated with star-spangled ceilings.[458][index_split_036.html#filepos857347] It is easy to see how symbolism of thiskind would have been be appropriate in the context of the Horus-King’s cosmicquest to find the astral form of Osiris.The causeway of the Sphinx runs to the immediate south of the monument at aboutthe level of its shoulder and thence slopes gently upwards in a westerlydirection towards the great ‘Mortuary Temple’ that stands outside the east faceof the central Pyramid of Giza. Being in every sense ‘dry’, it makes sense toconsider this causeway as being the ‘road by land’ to Rostau.But where might the other ‘road’ be located—the ‘way through water’? There maybe an important clue in the Book of What is in the Duat. In this eerie textthere is a depiction of the hermetically sealed chamber of the ‘Kingdom ofSokar’—Sokar-Osiris—which is also the Fifth Division of the Duat. The depictionshows a tunnel filled with water passing under the paws of a large Sphinx (seepage 148). The tunnel slopes gently upwards leading, finally, to the SixthDivision.Interestingly enough, as we saw in Part I, geologists working around the GreatSphinx in the early 1990s identified a large rectangular chamber and other‘anomalies’ in the bedrock directly beneath the monument’s paws. Interestingly,too, it is well known that far below the Sphinx is an underground watertablewhich has been constantly replenished since times immemorial by capillary actionfrom the Nile.[459] [index_split_036.html#filepos857635]TunnelDr. Jean Kerisel, the eminent French engineer whose work in the SubterraneanChamber of the Great Pyramid we are already familiar with,[460][index_split_036.html#filepos857921] has recently taken the geological evidencefurther by suggesting that the Sphinx may stand over the entrance to a700-metre-long tunnel leading to the Great Pyramid—a tunnel that was once filledor partially filled with water.[461] [index_split_036.html#filepos858116]Could such a tunnel be the other ‘way’ that the Horus-King had to take to ‘seethe astral form of his Father’, i.e. Orion? The fact that inside the King’sChamber of the Great Pyramid is, indeed, a star-shaft pointed directly atOrion’s belt—the ‘Rostau’ in the sky—adds cogency to notions of some sort ofunderground access route that might have been used by initiates to journey insecret from the Sphinx to the inner passages and chambers of the Pyramid.Furthermore, in the Pyramid Texts we often hear of a ‘Causeway of Happiness’which is in the ‘North of the Field of Offerings’. And in the following passagethe Horus-King seems to be standing at the entrance of such a ‘causeway’ atexactly the time Sirius is performing its heliacal rising, i.e. ‘Heralding theNew Year’ 70 days after the sun’s crossing of the Milky Way:I am the herald of the Year, O Osiris, I have come on business of your fatherGeb [the earth-god] ... I speak to you, I have made you enduring. ‘Causeway ofHappiness’ is the name of this causeway north of the Field of Offerings. StandUp, Osiris, and commend me to those who are in charge of the ‘Causeway ofHappiness’ north of the Field of Offerings just as you commended Horus to Isison that day on which you made her pregnant ...[462][index_split_036.html#filepos858258]The ‘Field of Offerings’ had a celestial location in the Duat somewhere nearOrion.[463] [index_split_036.html#filepos858384] Dualistic logic thereforesuggests that its earthly counterpart must have been a place where ‘offerings’were made by the Horus-King when he was about to enter the Giza necropolis. Withthis in mind, it is surely of relevance that many of the New Kingdom sphinxstelae found at Giza, including the granite stela of Thutmosis IV that standsbetween the paws of the Sphinx itself, do in fact show the Horus-Kings makingofferings in a temple in front of the monument.[464][index_split_036.html#filepos858645] Furthermore, as the text quoted above makesclear, the ‘Causeway of Happiness’ ran to the north of the ‘Field of Offerings’.An underground ‘causeway’ running north-west from the temple of the Sphinx wouldlead to the Great Pyramid.So could Kerisel’s bold hypothesis be right?[465][index_split_036.html#filepos858924] Could such an underground system exist atGiza?StargateThese are questions that we shall return to in Part IV. Meanwhile what are we tomake of the mention of Isis and her pregnancy that also appears in the abovetext?In The Orion Mystery it has been shown that the Great Pyramid’s so-calledQueen’s Chamber could have been used for a symbolic ‘copulation’ or ‘seeding’ritual involving the person of the Horus-King on the one hand and the goddessIsis in her astral form (i.e. the star Sirius) on the other. In terms ofsky-ground dualism the two might have been thought of as being ‘connected’through the Chamber’s southern star-shaft, which was targeted on themeridian-transit of Sirius in the Pyramid Age.[466][index_split_036.html#filepos859526] This hypothesis is strengthened by the factthat such a copulation ritual is found clearly depicted in the Pyramid Texts andthat the moment when Osiris supposedly made Isis ‘pregnant’ is specified asbeing when Sirius crossed the meridian at dawn.[467][index_split_036.html#filepos859766] The texts also state of Osiris-Orion: ‘Yoursister Isis comes to you rejoicing for love of you.

Or toexpress the problem the right way round, and in the correct dualisticterminology, why is Hor-em-Akhet, Horus-in-the-Horizon—i.e. the Great Sphinx—notin alignment with Horakhti, Horus-of-the-Horizon, i.e. the constellation of Leo?Why, too, is the causeway of the Sphinx not directed to the rising sun so as to‘link-up’ the Horus-King with his cosmic solar counterpart?There is, it seems, a curious ‘dislocation’ between the ground and the sky atthe summer solstice in the epoch of 2500 BC. Moreover, as the reader will recallfrom Chapter 8, this sense of the entire arrangement being out of kilter is notconfined to the Sphinx and Leo in that epoch but involves the three greatPyramids of Giza as well.It may be the case that the solution to the riddle has all along been staring usin the face. Inscribed on the granite stela that the Sphinx holds between itsown heavily eroded paws—a stela that was placed there in honour of Thutmosis IV,a mighty Horus-King of Egypt—we read the following impressive royal titulary:The Majesty of Horus, Mighty Bull Begetting Radiance, Favourite of the TwoGoddesses, Enduring in Kingship like Atum, Golden Horus, Mighty of Sword,Repelling the Nine Bows, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Son of Re, Thutmosis ...given life, stability, satisfaction ... for ever.

He wassucceeded by a dynasty of semi-divine beings known as the “followers of Horus”,who, in turn, gave place to the historical kings of Egypt.’Selim Hassan, The Sphinx, Cairo, 1949When was the ‘genesis’ of civilization in Egypt? When did ‘history’ begin?According to T. G. H. James, formerly Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities at theBritish Museum, and a representative voice of orthodox opinion on these matters:‘The first truly historical period is that which begins with the invention ofwriting and it is generally known as the Dynastic Period. It is a periodextending from about 3100 BC to 332 BC and it derives its name from thethirty-one dynasties into which the successive kings of Egypt were divided in ascheme preserved in the work of Manetho, a priestly historian who lived duringthe [third century BC]. The unlettered cultures which flourished in Egypt beforethe beginning of the Dynastic Period, and which exhibit some of thecharacteristics which mark the earliest phases of Egyptian culture in theDynastic Period, are known as Predynastic ... Such traces of human life as arefound in the Nile Valley dating from before the Predynastic Period are usuallydescribed in the terms used for European Prehistory—Palaeolithic, Mesolithic andNeolithic.’[474] [index_split_036.html#filepos861714]So there we have it. Egyptian history—and civilization with it—began at around3100 BC. Before that there were merely ‘unlettered cultures’ (admittedly withsome ‘civilized’ characteristics), which were in turn preceded by ‘Stone Age’savages (‘Palaeolithic’ means literally ‘Old Stone Age’).The way James puts it, the whole picture seems very clear-cut, orderly andprecise. He really makes it sound as though all the facts are now in handconcerning the Predynastic Egyptians and their forebears, and that nothing moreremains to be discovered about any of them.Such anodyne notions of the past are widespread amongst Egyptologists who againand again in their textbooks, and also in mass-market publications like NationalGeographic and Time-Life’s misleadingly named Lost Civilizations series, conveythe comforting impression that the prehistory of Egypt is well understood,organized, categorized and safely put in its place (James even refers us to onespecific place in the British Museum where particular enlightenment apparentlyawaits us: the ‘Sixth Egyptian Room’ with its definitive display of ‘primitivetools made by the Palaeolithic inhabitants of Egypt’).[475][index_split_036.html#filepos861898] Likewise, on the other side of the Atlanticas we saw in Part I, Dr. Peter Lecovara, Curator of the Museum of Fine Arts inBoston, assures us that ‘thousands of Egyptologists working for hundreds ofyears have studied this problem [the prehistory of Egypt] and the chronology ispretty much worked out. There is no big surprise in store for us.’[476][index_split_036.html#filepos861992]But is everything really as orderly and as well worked out as the ‘experts’ say?And can we really be so sure that there is ‘no big surprise in store for us’?In our view Lecovara, James, and the many other scholars who share theiropinions, would do well to remember the advice of the late Labib Habachi,formerly the Egyptian government’s Chief Inspector of Antiquities, who warned in1984 that ‘Egyptology is a field in which chance discovery may disprove anestablished theory’.[477] [index_split_036.html#filepos862120] In the light ofthis possibility, Habachi’s suggestion was that Egyptologists should avoidmaking ‘unqualified statements’ and be honest enough to ‘salt their commentswith “probably” and “perhaps”.’[478] [index_split_036.html#filepos862296]Certainly a little more ‘probably’ and ‘perhaps’ would be in order where thePredynastic and earlier periods of Egyptian history are concerned. Far from theimpression conveyed to the public, the truth, as some scholars are prepared toadmit, is that ‘The state of knowledge of Egyptian prehistory in the latetwentieth century is still fragmentary’.[479][index_split_036.html#filepos862382]These are the words of Nicholas Grimal, Professor of Egyptology at the SorbonneUniversity in Paris, who also concedes:It has been clear since the Second World War not only that ‘prehistory’ beforethe Pharaohs was expanding on a hitherto unsuspected scale, but also that itappeared to be so diverse and self-contained that it was difficult to regard itsimply as a ‘preparatory’ stage for the Dynastic Period ...[480][index_split_036.html#filepos862546]The prevailing Egyptological consensus (to which Grimal in this respect at leastis an exception) is unable to offer any coherent theory which explains these‘diverse’ and ‘self-contained’ characteristics of Egyptian prehistory, or thataccount for the very serious problems of apparent non-continuity between thePredynastic and the Dynastic Periods. The ancient Egyptians themselves, however,passed down records to us which may contain the answer to the whole mystery.These records provide detailed information concerning a period that extends backmany thousands of years before the sudden emergence of the Pharaonic state inthe epoch of 3000 BC.The only problem is that no one is prepared to take these records seriously.Could this be because they conflict with the modern scholarly consensus onEgyptian chronology? Readers must make up their own minds but, as we shall seebelow, elements of the same records which do conform to the current theory areaccepted and taken seriously by Egyptologists.Three erasAs T. G. H. James tells us in his remarks quoted earlier, modern study ofancient Egyptian chronology is largely based on Manetho’s History of Egypt. Therespected Professor Walter Emery puts things much the same way when he reportsthat the writings of Manetho are of ‘immense importance and form the frameworkon which Egyptian history has been built’.[481][index_split_036.html#filepos862632]One of the reasons that Manetho’s system is so durable and remains in use byEgyptologists today is that it has again and again proved itself to be accurate.He is known to have based it on ‘much older documents, or king-lists, to which,as a learned priest he had access’.[482] [index_split_036.html#filepos862777]Furthermore a number of documents in this category—notably the Palermo Stone,the Turin Papyrus and the Abydos King-List—have been found and translated. Inthe words of the late Professor Michael Hoffman, a leading expert on Egyptbefore the Pharaohs: ‘Archaeologists and Egyptologists have discovered five suchlists which, despite some discrepancies, support Manetho in general.’[483][index_split_036.html#filepos862961]Looking at all the surviving sources, it is clear that three distinct eras ofkingship were remembered:· The first era was when the Neteru, (‘Neters’ or ‘Gods’) ruled the land ofEgypt—an epoch that culminated with the kingship of Horus, the son of Osiris andIsis.· Then came the era of the ‘Followers of Horus’, the Shemsu Hor, (alsoknown by numerous other titles and epithets) which took the divine Horianlineage across the ages and up to a human Pharaoh named Menes (also known asNarmer or ‘King Scorpion’), the legendary ‘Unifier of the Two Lands of Upper andLower Egypt’.· After Menes came the so-called ‘Dynastic’ Kings, whose names areindividually catalogued in the king-lists.Egyptologists place the reign of Menes in circa 3000 BC and regard him as thefirst ‘historical’ king of ‘Dynastic’ Egypt.[484][index_split_036.html#filepos863047] They concede that a few Predynastic‘chieftains’ must have preceded him in both the north and south of the countrybut they emphatically reject any suggestion that the ‘Neters’ and the ‘Followersof Horus’ catalogued in the king-lists (and referred to with some prominence byManetho) could have been historical individuals. On the contrary, the consensusview is that the Neters, being ‘Gods’, are obvious religious fictions and thatthe Shemsu Hor are to be regarded as nothing more than ‘mythical kings’ whoruled in an equally ‘mythical kingdom’.So, scholars accept as history only the bits of Manetho and the survivingking-lists that fit their theory—i.e. the records of the Dynastic Period fromMenes on—and devalue all references in those same records to earlier and moremysterious times.Writing in the Cambridge Ancient History, for example, Professor T. E. Peetgroups together all the ancient Egyptian sources concerning the chronology ofthe ‘Gods’ and the ‘Followers of Horus’ and then dismisses the entire corpus ofmaterial with the following throwaway remark: ‘From the historical point of viewthere is little to be made of this.’[485] [index_split_036.html#filepos863181]Likewise, in Kingship and the Gods, his detailed study of the Pharaonic state,the eminent Henri Frankfort, Professor of Preclassical Antiquity at theUniversity of London, had this to say about the ‘Followers of Horus’:... it appears that ‘Followers of Horus’ is a vague designation for the kings ofa distant past ... but it would seem unwise to treat the term as primarily of ahistorical nature. For each king became at death one of the corporation of‘transfigured spirits’ ... [and] merged with that nebulous spiritual force whichhad supported the living rulers and descendents of the Throne of Horus sincetime immemorial.[486] [index_split_036.html#filepos863313]High initiatesWe feel obliged to point out that this was not at all how the ancient Egyptiansviewed their own history. For them there was never any question of mythicalepochs or ‘nebulous spiritual forces’ lurking in the distant past. For them, tostate matters plainly, the ‘Followers of Horus’, and the geographical landscapein which they had ‘ruled’, were unquestionable realities to which they weredirectly and inseverably connected. Indeed, if one takes the Egyptian accountsand traditions seriously what the ‘Followers of Horus’ begin to sound like is alineage of real, although ‘unnamed’ individuals whose function and duty, asHenri Frankfort himself suggested, was to provide the ‘spiritual force’ behindthe monarchy (though by no means in a ‘vague’ or ‘nebulous’ manner). TheEgyptians’ own accounts also invite the conclusion that the role of these‘Followers’ may have been to carry down the ages a body of extraordinaryknowledge harking back to the even more mysterious ‘time of the Neteru’—i.e. the‘Gods’.From available primary sources, in other words, the overall picture that emergesis that the ‘Followers of Horus’ may not have been ‘kings’ in the usual sense ofthe word but rather immensely powerful and enlightened individuals—highinitiates who were carefully selected by an élite academy that establisheditself at the sacred site of Heliopolis-Giza thousands of years before historybegan. There is much to suggest, too, that the ancient Egyptian texts are rightand that Pharaonic civilization may indeed have owed its unique spark of geniusto just such a ‘brotherhood’ linked to just such an archaic and élite academy.So who might the Shemsu Hor really have been? And what were they ‘following’?Following the Way of HorusHeliopolis—ancient On or Innu—was the oldest organized religious centre in Egyptand most probably in the world. Situated some 12 miles northeast of the Gizaplateau, and already hoary with age at the dawn of the Pharaonic epoch, it isidentified by tradition as the source of the secrets of astral immortality whichthe Pyramid builders claimed to have inherited. Indeed the title of the HighPriest of Heliopolis, as Professor I. E. S. Edwards has recently demonstrated,was ‘Chief of the Astronomers’, and the regalia of this notable was a ceremonialrobe spangled with five-pointed stars.[487] [index_split_036.html#filepos863482][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image053.jpg]53. Osiris-Orion showing the way to his ‘Followers’, the Horus-Kings, who arethe custodians of his dual kingdom in the Duat.As we have already hinted in Part III, the dominant concerns of the elitist,‘scientific’ priests of Heliopolis were with recording the motions of the stars,measuring and commemorating the passage of time, and peering into the mysteriesof the epochs. It has long been known, too, that they carefully studied thecycle of the sun in its perceived yearly circuit along the zodiacal path. Andmore recently, compelling evidence has emerged that they also followed the farlonger cosmic cycle of the ‘Great Year’—namely the precessional ‘drift’ of thestars caused by the earth’s axial ‘wobble’. The reader will recall that thisvast cycle of 25,920 years was measured by the slow rotation of the twelvezodiacal constellations in relation to the point of sunrise on the vernalequinox—in short, the ‘precession of the equinoxes’ in which a succession ofastrological ‘Ages’, each 2160 years in duration, was believed to have begun tounfold after a kind of spiritual and cultural ‘Big Bang’ known as Zep Tepi—the‘First Time’ of the Gods.To observe and accurately measure the rate of the precession of the equinoxes isa feat that could only have been achieved by scientifically minded,intellectually advanced and highly organized people with a long tradition ofprecise observational astronomy. Similarly, the building of the three greatPyramids of Giza was not the work of technological primitives only recentlyemerged from the Stone Age. On the contrary, as historians of science Giorgio deSantillana and Hertha von Dechend have pointed out, such accomplishments ‘shouldbe a cogent reason for concluding that serious and intelligent men were at workbehind the stage, men who were bound to have used a technical terminology’.[488][index_split_036.html#filepos863811]We shall argue that ‘serious and intelligent men’—and apparently women too—wereindeed at work behind the stage of prehistory in Egypt and propose that one ofthe many names by which they were known was the ‘Followers of Horus’. Wepropose, too, that their purpose, to which their generations adhered forthousands of years with the rigour of a messianic cult, may have been to bringto fruition a great cosmic blueprint. And we have evidence that the slowunfolding and implementation of this plan somehow entailed tracking twoobservable ‘ways’ taken by the celestial bodies across the ages—‘ways’ which areboth consequences of the earth’s axial precession:· First the ‘way’ of the stars: these appear to ‘drift’ in the sense thattheir place and day of rising at the horizon changes, accompanied bycorresponding changes in their altitude at the meridian.· Secondly the ‘way’ of the sun, which also appears to ‘drift’—in this case‘westwards’ along the ecliptic path so that the ‘pointer’ of the vernal equinoxappears to ‘sweep’ slowly through each one of the twelve zodiacal signs every2160 years.In the coded astronomical language of the ancients of Heliopolis, we will arguethat the notion of following the sun’s westward drift through the zodiactranslates as ‘Following the Way of Horus (the sun) across the ages’. And wewill show that the ‘Followers of Horus’ are most likely to have acquired theirenigmatic title because it described precisely what they did and stood for. Theywere, we suspect, astrologers and astronomers par excellence who had beenfollowing and recording the position of the vernal point across the ages fromthe epoch of the ‘First Time’ to the epoch of the historical kings of Egypt.Last but not least, we also propose as a hypothesis for further testing that ata well-defined and predetermined historical moment ‘written in the stars’ the‘Followers of Horus’ may have taken steps to mobilize the native inhabitants ofEgypt, unite them into a theocratic state and harness their energies to thefurther fulfilment of a cosmic blueprint in which the great Pyramids on the westbank of the Nile were to play a pivotal role ..."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12> > Sages and ‘Followers’‘The introduction to the first Edfu cosmological record discloses the traditionthat the contents of these records were the “words of the Sages”. We are toldthat this sacred book was believed to be a “Copy of the writings which Thothmade according to the words of the Sages” ...’E. A. E. Reymond, The Mythical Origin of the Egyptian Temple, 1969It is a convention amongst modern scholars that myths do not count as historicalevidence—and, as we saw in the last chapter, this convention is particularlystrongly adhered to by Egyptologists.Yet there are several well-known cases in archaeology where myths that have beendismissed as ‘unhistorical’ were later proved to have been entirely accurate.One example concerns the world-famous Troy of Homer’s Iliad (a great prose-poemcompiled from earlier oral sources circa 800 BC). Until not long ago mostscholars were convinced that Troy was a ‘mythical city’—i.e. entirely a figmentof Homer’s fertile imagination. In 1871, however, the ‘buccaneer’ Germanexplorer Heinrich Schliemann proved orthodox opinion wrong when he followedgeographical clues contained in the Iliad and discovered Troy in western Turkeynear the Dardanelles (the ancient Hellespont)—exactly where Homer had said itwas located. Schliemann and two other intrepid researchers, the Greek scholarKalokairinos and the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans, then went on to capthis achievement by following up myths concerning the great ‘Minoan’civilization that was said to have existed on the island of Crete. These myths,too, were dismissed as unhistorical by orthodox opinion but were vindicated whenSchliemann and his team excavated the remains of a highly advanced culture nowfirmly identified as that of the ‘Minoans’.[489][index_split_036.html#filepos863978]Similarly, in the Indian subcontinent, the great body of ancient Sanskritscriptures known as the Rig-Veda contains repeated references to a highcivilization, living in fortified cities, that had preceded the Aryan invasionsmore than 4000 years ago. Again these references were universally dismissed as‘mythical’—until, that is, the ruins of the great ‘Indus Valley’ cities such asHarappa and Moenjodaro began to be unearthed in the twentieth century and provedto date back as far as 2500 BC.[490] [index_split_036.html#filepos864166]In short, the record shows that whole cities and civilizations which were onceclassified as mythical (and therefore of no historical interest) have a habitagain and again of suddenly materializing from the mists of obscurity andbecoming historical realities.Could the same thing be about to happen in Egypt?Guardians of recordsAmongst other peoples such as the Romans and the Greeks, who were considerablycloser to ancient Egypt than we are, it was held to be axiomatic that thePharaohs and their priests were the guardians of accurate records concerningcertain highly significant events that had taken place long, long ago. Indeedthese records were actually seen and studied, at the sacred city of Heliopolis,by such distinguished visitors as Herodotus (fifth century BC), the Greeklawmaker Solon (640-560 BC) and his fellow countryman the scientist Pythagoras(sixth century BC).[491] [index_split_036.html#filepos864342] From their reportsderived the Greek impression of Egypt reported by Plato:[492][index_split_036.html#filepos864484]We Greeks are in reality children compared with this people with traditions tentimes older. And as nothing of precious remembrance of the past would longsurvive in our country, Egypt has recorded and kept eternally the wisdom of theold times. The walls of its temples are covered with inscriptions and thepriests have always under their own eyes that divine heritage ... Thegenerations continue to transmit to successive generations these sacred thingsunchanged: songs, dances, rhythms, rituals, music, paintings, all coming fromtime immemorial when gods governed the earth in the dawn of civilization.[493][index_split_036.html#filepos864570]We have already made frequent mention of Zep Tepi, the supposedly mythical‘First Time’ of the Gods—a remote epoch with which the ancient Egyptiansassociated the origins of their civilization. And in the last chapter we notedthat Manetho’s fabled History, and a number of inscriptions known as king-lists,also refer back to distant golden ages when the gods, and then subsequently themysterious ‘Followers of Horus’, ruled in the Nile Valley. Before immersingourselves in the next chapter in the truly immense chronology of which all thelists speak, our objective here, as Plato prompts, is to take a look at the‘walls of temples’—specifically at the so-called ‘Building Texts’ (circa 200 BC)inscribed on the walls of the Temple of Edfu that stands in Upper Egypt midwaybetween Luxor and Aswan. These texts, which contain a series of extraordinaryreferences to the ‘First Time’, are accepted by scholars as the only survivingfragments of a much more ancient, much larger, and much more coherent body ofcosmogonical literature—now long lost—that once incorporated a complete‘mythical history’ of Egypt, of its gods and of the temples built to honourthem.[494] [index_split_036.html#filepos864677] In the texts, the ‘Followers ofHorus’ are equated and merged with other ‘mythical’ beings, sometimes seeminglydivine, sometimes human, who are always portrayed as the bringers and preserversof knowledge down the ages—as an élite brotherhood dedicated to the transmissionof wisdom and to the quest for resurrection and rebirth ...Memories of the dawnThe Temple of Edfu in its present form was erected over a two hundred-yearperiod between 237 BC and 57 BC but incorporates parts of much earlierstructures dating back to the Pyramid Age (for example portions of the inner andouter western enclosure wall). Moreover, like all major temples, it was built‘on hallowed ground’ and there attaches to it a recollection of vast antiquityand of momentous antecedents.[495] [index_split_036.html#filepos864924]Thus, on the face of things, the Building Texts appear to be nothing more than ahistory of the Edfu Temple itself, together with descriptions of its rooms andhalls and of their ritual purpose and significance.[496][index_split_036.html#filepos865084] A closer look, however, as E. A. E. Reymondof Manchester University has demonstrated, reveals a subtext which hints:at the existence of certain mythological events ... where the foundation,building and bringing to life of the historical temple [of Edfu] is interpretedas happening in a mythical age. The historical temple is interpreted as the workof the gods themselves, and as an entity of a mythical nature. This ... seems toindicate a belief in a historical temple that was a direct continuation,projection, and reflexion of a mythical temple that came into existence at thebeginning of the world ...[497] [index_split_036.html#filepos865245]Needless to say the ‘beginning of the world’ is a synonym in the Edfu Texts forthe ‘First Time’, also known as the ‘Early Primeval Age’. In this epoch, welearn, the ‘words of the Sages’ were copied down by the wisdom-god Thoth into abook that codified the locations of certain ‘sacred mounds’ along the Nile. Thetitle of this lost book, according to the texts, was Specifications of theMounds of the Early Primaeval Age, and it was believed to have contained recordsnot only of all the lesser ‘Mounds’, or temples, but also of the Great PrimevalMound itself, the place where time had supposedly begun.[498][index_split_036.html#filepos865331]Several points of interest arise:1. The ‘Great Primeval Mound’ has recently been associated by ProfessorI. E. S. Edwards with the natural outcropping of rock that is known to lie underthe Great Pyramid of Egypt and to have been incorporated into its lower coursesof masonry.[499] [index_split_036.html#filepos865426] This analysis appears toreinforce the connections that we have already established in Part I between theGiza necropolis and the ‘First Time’.2. The ‘Sages’ referred to in the Edfu Building Texts were seven innumber. Their special role was as ‘the only divine beings who knew how thetemples and sacred places were to be created’. And it was they who initiatedconstruction work at the Great Primeval Mound. This work, in which Thoth alsoparticipated, involved the setting out and erection of the original ‘mythical’temple of the ‘First Time’.[500] [index_split_036.html#filepos865646]3. Also constructed under the direction of the ‘Seven Sages’ was anedifice specified as hwt-ntr, ‘the mansion of the god’: ‘ “Speedy ofconstruction”, men called it by name. The sanctuary is within it, “Great Seat”by name, and all its chapels are according to the norm.’[501][index_split_036.html#filepos865832]4. When all these works were complete ‘the magical protection (swr mdw)of that site was made by the Sages’.[502] [index_split_036.html#filepos865926]5. In the whole corpus of ancient Egyptian writings, the Edfu BuildingTexts preserve the only references to the ‘Seven Sages’ that have survived tothe present day. Egyptologists have therefore paid little attention to theidentity of these beings beyond conceding that that they appear to have played apart in ‘a much wider and more general theory concerning the origin of sacreddomains and their temples’.[503] [index_split_036.html#filepos866020] In ouropinion, however, there is something notable about the context in which theTexts describe the Sages. This context is marked by a preponderance of ‘Flood’imagery in which the ‘primeval waters’ (out of which the Great Primeval Moundemerged) are depicted as gradually receding.[504][index_split_036.html#filepos866114] We are reminded of Noah’s mountain-top onwhich the Ark settled after the Biblical Deluge, and of the ‘Seven Sages’(Apkallu) of ancient Babylonian tradition who were said to have ‘lived beforethe Flood’ and to have built the walls of the sacred city of Uruk.[505][index_split_036.html#filepos866216] Likewise is it an accident that in Indiantradition ‘Seven Sages’ (Rishis) are remembered to have survived the Flood,their purpose being to preserve and pass down to future generations the wisdomof the antediluvian world?[506] [index_split_036.html#filepos866431]In all cases the Sages appear as the enlightened survivors of a cataclysm thatwiped the earth clean, who then set about making a fresh start at the dawn of anew age—which, in ancient Egypt, was referred to as the ‘First Time’. As Reymondconfirms in her masterly study of the Edfu Texts:the first era known by our principal sources was a period which started fromwhat existed in the past. The general tone of the record seems to convey theview that an ancient world, after having been constituted, was destroyed, and asa dead world it came to be the basis of a new period of creation which at firstwas the re-creation and resurrection of what once had existed in the past.[507][index_split_036.html#filepos866682]Wisdom and knowledgeAccording to the Edfu Texts the Seven Sages and the other gods came originallyfrom an island,[508] [index_split_036.html#filepos866848] the ‘Homeland of thePrimeval Ones’.[509] [index_split_036.html#filepos866942] As noted above, thetexts are adamant that the agency that destroyed this island was a flood. Theyalso tell us that it came to its end suddenly[510][index_split_036.html#filepos867036] and that the majority of its ‘divineinhabitants’ were drowned.[511] [index_split_036.html#filepos867131] Arriving inEgypt, those few who survived then became ‘the Builder Gods, who fashioned inthe primeval time, the Lords of Light ... the Ghosts, the Ancestors ... whoraised the seed for gods and men ... the Senior Ones who came into being at thebeginning, who illumined this land when they came forth unitedly ...’[512][index_split_036.html#filepos867235]It was not believed that these remarkable beings were immortal. On the contrary,after they had completed their tasks they died and their children took theirplaces and performed funerary rites on their behalf.[513][index_split_036.html#filepos867329] In this way, just like the ‘Followers ofHorus’, the generations of the ‘Builder Gods’, or ‘Sages’, or ‘Ghosts’ or ‘Lordsof Light’ described in the Edfu Texts could constantly renew themselves—thuspassing down to the future traditions and wisdoms stemming from a previous epochof the earth. Indeed, the similarities between the ‘Senior Ones’ of Edfu and theShemsu Hor of Heliopolitan tradition are so marked it is hard to escape theconclusion that both epithets, and the numerous others that exist, are alldescriptions of the same shadowy brotherhood.This impression is strengthened by the constant references in the Edfu Texts tothe ‘wisdom of the Sages’ (wisdom being one of the defining characteristics ofthe ‘Followers of Horus’) and the repeated emphasis that their special gift wasknowledge—including, but not limited to, the knowledge of architecture.[514][index_split_036.html#filepos867424] Likewise it is noteworthy that the Sagesare said to have specified the plans and designs that were to be used for allfuture temples—a role frequently accorded in other contexts to the ‘Followers ofHorus’. For example, the temple of Dendera (a little to the north of Edfu) isinscribed with Building Texts of its own which state that the ‘great plan’followed by its architects was ‘recorded in ancient writings handed down fromthe “Followers of Horus” ’.[515] [index_split_036.html#filepos867519]Heliopolitan originsThe earliest-surviving references to the ‘Followers of Horus’ occur in thePyramid Texts. It is therefore unlikely to be an accident that the notion in theEdfu Texts of the Great Primeval Mound emerging from the waters of a universaldeluge coincides exactly with imagery that has also been preserved in thePyramid Texts in which, as E. A. E. Reymond summarizes: ‘The Earth in itsearliest shape was pictured as a mound which emerged from the primeval water.This mound itself was then considered as a divine being, and as the originalterrestrial configuration on which the creator, Atum, dwelt.’[516][index_split_036.html#filepos867752]As is well known, the compilation of the Pyramid Texts was undertaken by thepriests of Heliopolis.[517] [index_split_036.html#filepos867914] It maytherefore be of relevance that ancient Egyptian traditions attribute thefounding of Heliopolis to the ‘Followers of Horus’—in a period long before thebeginning of Dynastic times—and that there is an Egyptian papyrus, now in theBerlin Museum, which clearly suggests that Heliopolis in some way ‘existedbefore the earth was created’.[518] [index_split_036.html#filepos868072] Onceagain, this interlinks closely with a central proposition of the Edfu Texts,namely that the ‘new world’ created by the Sages after the Flood was conceivedof and designed by its makers as ‘the resurrection of the former world of thegods.’[519] [index_split_036.html#filepos868356]There are other links too. For example what Reymond calls ‘the manifestation ofthe resurrection of the first holy world’ took the form in the Edfu Texts of anupright column or rod, ‘the Perch’ on which a great bird, the Divine Falcon,rested.[520] [index_split_036.html#filepos868519] In Heliopolis there stood apillar (indeed Innu, the Egyptian name for Heliopolis, actually means‘pillar’[521] [index_split_036.html#filepos868617]) on which it was believedthat another ‘Divine’ bird—the Bennu, or phoenix—periodically rested.[522][index_split_036.html#filepos868789] And interestingly the hieroglyph forHeliopolis—a column surmounted by a cross above (or beside) a circle dividedinto eight parts[523] [index_split_036.html#filepos868883]—is virtuallyidentical to a hieroglyph depicting the Edfu ‘Perch’ that is reproduced byFlinders Petrie in his Royal Tombs of the Earliest Dynasties.[524][index_split_036.html#filepos869054]For all these reasons, and many others, Reymond concludes that ‘the Edfudocumentary sources offer ... one argument more in favour of the theory that theritual of the Egyptian temple was Heliopolitan in origin ... We are of theopinion that the Edfu records preserve the memory of a Predynastic religiouscentre which once existed near to Memphis, which the Egyptians looked on as thehomeland of the Egyptian temple.’[525] [index_split_036.html#filepos869263]What better candidate is there for that ‘Predynastic religious centre near toMemphis’—that ‘homeland’ of the Egyptian temple—than the sacred city ofHeliopolis and its associated Pyramids and other structures on the Giza plateau?Moreover, as the reader will recall, the Giza/Heliopolis complex lies to thenorth of ancient Memphis. In this light a well-known text on the inner face ofthe enclosure wall of the temple at Edfu takes on a special meaning, for ittells us that the temple was built ‘at the dictates of the Ancestors’ accordingto what was written in a certain ‘book’ which had ‘descended from the sky to thenorth of Memphis’.[526] [index_split_036.html#filepos869443]There is of course a sense in which the cosmic monuments of Giza couldthemselves be said to be a kind of ‘book’ written in stone and ‘descended fromthe sky’—for, as we now know, the three great Pyramids are the terrestrialcounterparts of the three stars of Orion’s belt and the Sphinx draws down toearth the regal image of Leo, the celestial lion.Cycle of the phoenixThe Primeval Mound, identified with the Great Pyramid and with the natural moundof rock that is incorporated into the foundations of that monument, is envisagedin the Pyramid Texts as a place at once of birth and death, and also as a placeof rebirth.[527] [index_split_036.html#filepos869538] These ideas fit well withthe ancient Egyptian rituals for ‘awakening Osiris’ and attaining astralimmortality—and with the quest of the Horus-King—that we have described inearlier chapters. They also accord with the sense that the texts convey of acyclical rhythm at work in the universe as the vast ‘Mill’ of the zodiac grindsout the destiny of world ages.In Heliopolitan theology, all these processes were grouped together, summarizedand expressed in a single image—the Bennu bird, the legendary Phoenix which atcertain widely separated intervals ‘fashioned a nest of aromatic boughs andspices, set it on fire and was consumed in the flames. From the pyremiraculously sprang a new phoenix, which, after embalming its father’s ashes inan egg of myrrh, flew with the ashes to Heliopolis where it deposited them inthe altar of the Egyptian sun-god, Re. A variant of the story made the dyingphoenix fly to Heliopolis and immolate itself in the altar fire, from which theyoung phoenix then rose ... The Egyptians associated the phoenix withimmortality.’[528] [index_split_036.html#filepos869705]Sources vary as to the period of the Bennu’s return, but in his authoritativestudy on the subject R. T. Rundle Clark mentions the figure of 12,954years.[529] [index_split_036.html#filepos869825] Let us note that this figureaccords very closely with a half-cycle of precession (where the full cycle, aswe have seen, is 25,920 years). As such, ‘the return of the phoenix’ could beexpressed in astronomical terms either as a slow ‘sweep’ of the vernal pointthrough six houses of the zodiac—for example from the beginning of Leo to thebeginning of Aquarius—or, at the meridian, as the number of years required for astar to move between its minimum and maximum altitudes above the horizon.When considering such co-ordinates in the sky, we are immediately reminded ofthe Giza necropolis—of how the gaze of the Great Sphinx targets the vernal pointon the eastern horizon, and of how the star-shafts of the Great Pyramid lock into the meridian with machine-age accuracy. Moreover it can hardly be an accidentthat the capstone or pyramidion placed on top of all pyramids was known in theancient Egyptian language as the Benben and was considered to be a symbol of theBennu bird (and thus also of rebirth and immortality).[530][index_split_036.html#filepos869949] These capstones were replicas of theoriginal Benben stone—perhaps a conical, ‘orientated’ meteorite[531][index_split_036.html#filepos870043]—which was said to have ‘fallen from heaven’and which was kept in Heliopolis, perched atop a pillar in a Temple called the‘Mansion of the Phoenix’.[532] [index_split_036.html#filepos870141]Is it not apparent, therefore, that we are confronted here by a tightly knitcomplex of interwoven ideas, all additionally complicated by masses of Egyptiandualism, in which stone stands for bird, and bird for stone,[533][index_split_036.html#filepos870235] and both together speak of rebirth and ofthe ‘eternal return’?The capstone is of course missing from the summit of the Great Pyramid at Giza.And the Benben of Heliopolis was already long lost to history by the time of theGreeks ...[534] [index_split_036.html#filepos870414]Will these treasures, too, sooner or later ‘return’?[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image054.jpg]54. Artist’s impression of the ‘Mansion of the Phoenix’ in Heliopolis with itsoriginal pillar and pyramid-shaped Benben stone.Ancestor gods‘Underlying all Egyptian speculation’, as R. T. Rundle Clark has observed, ‘isthe belief that time is composed of recurrent cycles which are divinelyappointed ...’[535] [index_split_036.html#filepos870540] There is furthermore agoverning moment amongst all these cycles and epochs—the ‘genesis event’ thatthe Egyptians called Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’.Zep means ‘Time’, Tepi means ‘First’.But Tepi also has other connotations. For example, it is the word for ‘theforemost point of a ship’ and it can likewise be interpreted as ‘the first dayof a period of time’. Moreover, according to the astute analysis of Robert K. G.Temple: ‘The basic meaning of the word Tep is “mouth” ... and even morefundamentally the “beginning or commencement of anything”.’[536][index_split_036.html#filepos870682]Perhaps because of this persistent connection with the beginning of things, Tepican also mean ‘ancestors’. And the Tepi-aui-qerr-en-pet were ‘the ancestor-godsof the circle of the sky’.[537] [index_split_036.html#filepos870855] Also in thePyramid Texts Tepi-aui is one of the many titles by which the ancestral deitiesof the ‘early primeval age’ were known—the gods and Sages, or ‘Followers ofHorus’, who were supposedly there, at the dawn of civilization, when the phoenixalighted atop the pillar at Heliopolis, uttering a great cry and setting inmotion the ‘time’ of our present epoch of the world ...Curiously, the hieroglyphic sign used to determine the Tepi-aui is the body of alarge, slouching lion, with only the paws, breast and head shown. And we find asimilar device being used as the determinative for a very similar class ofbeings called the Akeru, described in Wallis Budge’s Hieroglyphic Dictionary asa group of gods said to be the ancestors of Re.[538][index_split_036.html#filepos871018]The reader will recall from earlier chapters that one of the distinguishingfeatures of the Fifth Division of the Duat is the presence there of a giantdouble-lion Sphinx-god named Aker whom Egyptologist Mark Lehner suggests may be‘a representation of the Sphinx at Giza’.[539][index_split_036.html#filepos871121] Since it is from Aker that the Akeru derivetheir name, it is natural that the hieroglyphs should depict them either in theform of slouching lions, or of two lions back to back, or of a double-headedlion.[540] [index_split_036.html#filepos871262]So the texts seem to invite us to attach leonine characteristics to the ‘men orgods of olden times’, to the ‘Ancestors’, and to the Sages. But they also invitesomething else when, as we shall see in the next chapter, they link the wholeconcept of ancestral dynasties of gods and spirits with another closely relatedword, Akhu, meaning, variously, the ‘Shining Ones’, the ‘Star People’ or the‘Venerables’. In this way they will lead us back to the trail of the ‘Followersof Horus’ and to the notion that for thousands of years—spanning both theprehistoric and the historic periods—the members of a hidden academy may havebeen at work behind the scenes in Egypt, observing the stars with scientificrigour and manipulating men and events according to a celestial timetable ..."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13> > Following the Stars‘The disposition of the stars as well as their movements have always been thesubject of careful observation among the Egyptians ... they have preserved tothis day records concerning each of these stars over an incredible number ofyears, this study having been zealously preserved among them from ancienttimes.’Diodorus Siculus, Book V, first century BCIt should be clear by now that the ancient Egyptians had very distinct ideasabout the length and scope of their history, and that they set the ‘First Time’,the ‘genesis event’ for their civilization, far back in what the Edfu BuildingTexts call the ‘Early Primeval Age’. Just how long ago that event actually tookplace is not an issue that will be easily resolved because the survivingtexts—the king-lists, the very few fragments of Manetho’s History that have beenpreserved, and certain travellers’ tales—are mostly incomplete and at timesmutually contradictory. Moreover we are obliged to cut our way through aluxuriant jungle of diverse terminologies—Sages, Ancestors, Spirits of the Dead,the ‘Followers of Horus’, etc., etc.—which further complicates the problem oftrying to arrive at a coherent picture. Nevertheless, let us see what we canglean from these ancient sources. Let us try to put the jigsaw puzzle together...Shining onesAmongst the very few king-lists that have survived to the present day, theso-called ‘Turin Papyrus’ reaches particularly deeply into the dark abyss of thepast. Regrettably, more than half of the contents of this fragile document fromthe second millennium BC have been lost because of the gross incompetence withwhich it was handled by scholars when it was transferred (in a biscuit tin) fromthe collection of the King of Sardinia to its present home in the Museum ofTurin.[541] [index_split_036.html#filepos871412] The remaining fragments,however, offer occasional tantalising glimpses of an astonishing chronology.Of the greatest importance amongst these fragments is a badly damaged verticalregister in which the names and reigns of ten Neteru or ‘Gods’ were originallygiven. Although in most cases the durations of these reigns are now illegible orcompletely broken away, it is possible to read the figure of 3126 years ascribedto the rule of the wisdom-god Thoth and the figure of 300 years ascribed toHorus, the last fully ‘divine’ king of Egypt.[542][index_split_036.html#filepos871560] Immediately afterwards comes a secondvertical register devoted to the ‘Followers of Horus’—the Shemsu Hor—the mostprominent of that general class of beings variously called ‘Ancestors’, or‘Sages’ or ‘Ghosts’ or ‘Spirits’ whom the Egyptians remembered as having bridgedthe gap between the time of the gods and the time of Menes (the supposed firstking of the first historical Dynasty circa 3000 BC).[543][index_split_036.html#filepos871717] Again much of the register is missing, butits last two lines, which seem to represent a summing-up, are of particularinterest: ‘The Akhu, Shemsu Hor, 13,420 years; Reigns before the Shemsu Hor,23,200 years; Total 36,620 years.’[544] [index_split_036.html#filepos872024]The plural word ‘Akhu’ is normally translated as ‘Venerables’.[545][index_split_036.html#filepos872144] Yet, as we hinted at the end of the lastchapter, a close examination of the full range of meanings that the ancientEgyptians attached to it suggests that another and far more intriguingpossibility exists—one that is concealed by so generalized an epithet. To bespecific, the hieroglyphs for Akhu can also mean ‘Transfigured Beings’, ‘ShiningOnes’, ‘Shining Beings’ or ‘Astral Spirits’—understandably identified by somelinguists with the stars.[546] [index_split_036.html#filepos872230] And thereare other shades of meaning, too, that cry out to be taken into account. Forexample in Sir E. A. Wallis Budge’s authoritative Hieroglyphic Dictionary thefollowing additional definitions are provided for Akhu: ‘to be bright’, ‘to beexcellent’, or ‘to be wise’ and ‘instructed’.[547][index_split_036.html#filepos872370] And Budge further informs us that the wordwas frequently associated with ‘those who recite formulae’.[548][index_split_036.html#filepos872530]Such data, we suggest, calls for a rethink of the title ‘Venerables’ as appliedto the ‘Followers of Horus’ in the Turin Papyrus.[549][index_split_036.html#filepos872616] Rather than merely being ‘venerable’, is itnot possible that what was meant to be conveyed by the word Akhu in this contextwas a picture of vastly enlightened and learned people, apparently with someconnection to or interest in the stars—in short an élite of highly initiatedastronomer-philosophers?In support of this notion is the fact that the ‘Followers of Horus’ werefrequently linked in the ancient texts to another equally enlightened and‘shining’ class of ancestral beings called the ‘Souls of Pe’ and the ‘Souls ofNekhen’.[550] [index_split_036.html#filepos872728] Now Pe and Nekhen were actualgeographical locations in Egypt—the former in the north and the latter in thesouth.[551] [index_split_036.html#filepos872872] Interestingly enough, however,as Professor Henri Frankfort has confirmed, the ‘Souls’ of both these placeswere also frequently grouped collectively under yet another title, the ‘Souls ofHeliopolis’,[552] [index_split_036.html#filepos873004] who were said ‘to assistthe King’s ascent to heaven, a function commonly performed by the Souls ofNekhen and Pe ... A relief depicting this function shows the Souls of Pe andNekhen in the act, while the text calls them the “Souls of Heliopolis”.’[553][index_split_036.html#filepos873129]It is generally accepted that the term ‘Soul’—Ba—as used by the ancientEgyptians had stellar attributes connected to the notion of eternal life in theDuat to which all the historical Pharaohs aspired. Moreover, as Frankfortrightly points out, the Pyramid Texts do indeed define the dominant role of the‘Souls’ of Pe and Nekhen—and thus the ‘Souls’ of Heliopolis—as being to ensurethat when a Pharaoh died he would be ‘equipped’ to ascend to the sky and findhis way into the cosmic Kingdom of Osiris.[554][index_split_036.html#filepos873215] This in turn coincides with what we know ofthe Sages of Edfu and the ‘Followers of Horus’, both of whom, as we have seen,may be identified with a single and originally Heliopolitan ‘brotherhood’ oftemple-makers whose function was to prepare and initiate the generations of theHorus-Kings in order to bring about the ‘resurrection’ of what was remembered as‘the former world of the gods’.[555] [index_split_036.html#filepos873534]LegacyThe notion that some form of invisible college could have established itself atHeliopolis thousands of years before the Pharaohs, and could have been theinitiating force behind the creation and unfolding of ancient Egyptiancivilization, helps to explain one of the greatest mysteries confronted byEgyptology—namely the extremely sudden, indeed dramatic, manner in whichPharaonic culture ‘took off’ in the early third millennium BC. The independentresearcher John Anthony West, whose breakthrough work on the geology of theSphinx we reported in Part I, formulates the problem especially well:Every aspect of Egyptian knowledge seems to have been complete at the verybeginning. The sciences, artistic and architectural techniques and thehieroglyphic system show virtually no signs of a period of ‘development’;indeed, many of the achievements of the earliest dynasties were never surpassedor even equalled later on. This astonishing fact is readily admitted by orthodoxEgyptologists, but the magnitude of the mystery it poses is skilfullyunderstated, while its many implications go unmentioned.How does a complex civilization spring full-blown into being? Look at a 1905automobile and compare it to a modern one. There is no mistaking the process of‘development’. But in Egypt there are no parallels. Everything is right there atthe start.The answer to the mystery is of course obvious, but because it is repellent tothe prevailing cast of modern thinking, it is seldom seriously considered.Egyptian civilization was not a ‘development’, it was a legacy.[556][index_split_036.html#filepos873697]Might not the preservers of that legacy, who eventually bequeathed it to thePharaohs at the beginning of the Dynastic Period, have been those revered andsecretive individuals—the ‘Followers of Horus’, the Sages, the Senior Ones—whosememory haunts the most archaic traditions of Egypt like a persistent ghost?Gods and heroesIn addition to the Turin Papyrus other chronological records support the notionof an immensely ancient ‘academy’ at work behind the scenes in Egypt. Amongstthese, the most influential were compiled, as we saw earlier, by Manetho(literally, ‘Truth of Thoth’), who lived in the third century BC and who ‘roseto be high priest in the temple at Heliopolis’.[557][index_split_036.html#filepos873839] There he wrote his now lost History ofEgypt which later commentators tell us was divided up into three volumesdealing, respectively, with ‘the Gods, the Demigods, the Spirits of the Dead andthe mortal Kings who ruled Egypt’.[558] [index_split_036.html#filepos873952]The ‘Gods’ it seems, ruled for 13,900 years. After them ‘the Demigods andSpirits of the Dead’—epithets for the ‘Followers of Horus’—ruled for a further11,025 years.[559] [index_split_036.html#filepos874044] Then began the reign ofthe mortal kings, which Manetho divided into the thirty-one dynasties still usedand accepted by scholars today.Other fragments from Manetho’s History also suggest that important and powerfulbeings were present in Egypt long before the dawn of its historical period underthe rule of Menes. For example Fragment 3, preserved in the works of GeorgeSyncellus, speaks of ‘six dynasties or six gods who ... reigned for 11,985years’.[560] [index_split_036.html#filepos874136] And in a number of sourcesManetho is said to have given the figure of 36,525 years for the entire durationof the civilization of Egypt from the time of the gods down to the end of thelast dynasty of mortal kings.[561] [index_split_036.html#filepos874229]A rather different total of around 23,000 years has been handed down to us bythe Greek historian Diodorus Siculus who visited Egypt in the first century BCand spoke there with priests and chroniclers. According to the stories he wastold: ‘At first Gods and Heroes ruled Egypt for a little less than 18,000 years... Mortals have been kings of their country, they say, for a little less than5000 years.’[562] [index_split_036.html#filepos874323]Time bridgeAn overview of all the available chronologies in context of other relateddocuments such as the Pyramid Texts and the Edfu Building Texts leaves twodistinct impressions. Despite the conflicts and confusions over the precisenumbers of years involved, and despite the endless proliferation of names andtitles and honorifics and epithets:· It is clear that the ancient Egyptians thought in terms of very longperiods of time and would never have accepted the Egyptological view that theircivilization ‘began’ with the First Dynasty of Pharaohs.· It is clear that they were aware of an ‘influence’ at work in theirhistory—a continuous, unbroken influence that had extended over many thousandsof years and that was wielded by an élite group of divine and semi-divinebeings, often associated with leonine symbolism, who were called variously ‘Godsand Heroes’, the ‘Spirits of the Dead’, the ‘Souls’, the ‘Sages’, the ‘ShiningOnes’, the ‘Ancestors’, the ‘Ancestor-Gods of the Circle of the Sky’, the‘Followers of Horus’, etc., etc.It is clear, in other words, that the ancient Egyptians envisaged a kind of‘time bridge’, linking the world of men to the world of the gods, today toyesterday and ‘now’ to the ‘First Time’. It is clear, too that responsibilityfor maintaining this ‘bridge’ was attributed to the ‘Followers of Horus’ (bythis and many other names). And it is clear that the ‘Followers’ were rememberedas having carried down intact the traditions and secrets of the gods—alwayspreserving them, permitting not a single change—until finally sharing them withthe first dynasties of Egypt’s mortal kings.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image055.jpg]55. It is clear that the ancient Egyptians were aware of an ‘influence’ at workin their history—a continuous, unbroken influence that extended over manythousands of years and that was wielded by an élite group of divine andsemi-divine beings.Following the vernal pointThe etymology of the ancient Egyptian term Shemsu Hor, ‘Followers of Horus’, wasstudied by the Alsatian scholar R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz who concluded: ‘Theterm Shemsu Hor ... literally means ... “those who follow the path of Horus”,that is, the “Horian way”, also called the solar way ... These Followers ofHorus bear with them a knowledge of “divine origin” and unify the country withit ...’[563] [index_split_036.html#filepos874499]The ‘solar way’ or ‘path of Horus’ is, of course, the ecliptic—that imaginaryway or path in the sky on which the sun appears to travel through the twelvesigns of the zodiac. As we saw in earlier chapters, the direction of the sun’s‘journey’ during the course of the solar year is Aquariusà Piscesà AriesàTaurusà Geminià Cancerà Leo, etc., etc. The reader will recall, however, thatthere is also another, more ponderous motion, the precession of the earth’saxis, which gradually rotates the ‘ruling’ constellation against the backgroundof which the sun is seen to rise at dawn on the vernal equinox. This greatcycle, or ‘Great Year’, takes 25,920 solar years to complete, with the vernalpoint spending 2,160 years in each of the twelve zodiacal constellations. Thedirection of motion is Leoà Cancerà Geminià Taurusà Ariesà Piscesà Aquarius,etc., etc., i.e. the reverse of the route pursued by the sun during the courseof the solar year.We suggest that the ‘Followers of Horus’ followed—in a very precise,astronomical sense—not only the annual path of the sun, eastwards through thezodiac, but also, for thousands of years, the vernal point’s relentlessprecessional drift westwards through the same twelve constellations. We alsosuggest that this shadowy brotherhood, whose members were said to have carriedthe ‘knowledge of divine origin’ (which they would later use to ‘unify thecountry’), may have interrelated on an extremely selective basis with the moreprimitive inhabitants of the Nile Valley in the prehistoric and Predynasticperiods, interbreeding with chosen women and recruiting new generations fromamongst the brightest and the best of their offspring—but leaving little or notrace of their presence in the archaeological record. We suggest, too, thataround the beginning of the third millennium BC something happened in the cosmicorder of the night sky—something long preordained and expected by theirastronomers—that caused the ‘Followers’ to launch their grand attempt toinitiate and ‘unify’ the historical civilization of Egypt. Last but not least,we suggest that whoever they really may have been, it was the ‘Followers’—theSages, the Builder Gods—who provided this nascent civilization with theinjection of advanced technical knowledge, engineering, architectural andorganizing skills necessary for the completion of the vast celestial ‘temple’that we know today as the Giza necropolis ...In the next chapters we will test some of these hypotheses."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14> > Space-Time Co-ordinates‘The mind has lost its cutting edge, we hardly understand the ancients.’Gregoire de Tours, sixth century ADIn astronomical terms the ‘vernal point’ is the ‘address’ that the sun occupieson the spring equinox—its particular position on that particular day against thebackground of the zodiacal constellations that encircle the ecliptic (i.e. theperceived ‘path’ of the sun). As a result of a cosmic coincidence these twelveprominent constellations are distributed in the heavens in the plane of theecliptic (i.e. in the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun) and,furthermore, are spaced out more or less evenly around it. The vernal point,however, is not fixed. Because of the phenomenon of precession, as we have seenin earlier chapters, it gradually sweeps around the whole ‘dial’ of the zodiacat a precise and predictable rate.Between 3000 BC and 2500 BC, the epoch in which Egypt appears to have receivedthe sudden spark of genius that initiated the most brilliant achievements of thePyramid Age, the vernal point was stationed on the immediate right (i.e. ‘west’)bank of the Milky Way, drifting almost imperceptibly slowly past the small groupof stars, known as the Hyades, which form the head of Taurus[564][index_split_036.html#filepos874647]—the Bull of the Sky.What this means is that the vernal point had arrived in that region of the skydominated by the adjacent constellations of Taurus and Orion, and particularlyby the three stars of Orion’s belt. Moreover, as we have seen in Part I, thethree great Pyramids of Giza—which stand on the west bank of the Nile—weredesigned to serve as terrestrial models, or ‘doubles’ of those three stars.Now here is the interesting thing. If we regard the Giza Pyramids (in relationto the Nile) as part of a scaled-down ‘map’ of the right bank of the Milky Way,then we would need to extend that ‘map’ some 20 miles to the south in order toarrive at the point on the ground where the Hyades-Taurus should be represented.How likely is it to be an accident that two enormous Pyramids—the so-called‘Bent’ and ‘Red’ Pyramids of Dahshur—are found at this spot? And how likely isit to be an accident, as was demonstrated in The Orion Mystery, that the siteplan of these monuments, i.e. their pattern on the ground, correlates veryprecisely with the pattern in the sky of the two most prominent stars in theHyades?[565] [index_split_036.html#filepos874741]We suggest none of this is accidental, that the ‘celestial signal’ which‘sparked off the incredible Pyramid-building programme of Egypt’s Fourth Dynastywas provided by the precessional drift of the vernal point into theHyades-Taurus region, and that the ‘Hyades Pyramids’ of Dahshur were thereforenaturally built first.Such a theory provides a motive for the vast enterprise of Fourth-DynastyPyramid construction (involving some 25 million tons of stone blocks—more than75 per cent of all the stone that was quarried and shaped into Pyramids duringthe Pyramid Age).[566] [index_split_036.html#filepos874866] In addition, itaccords fully with archaeological evidence which suggests that the two superbPyramids at Dahshur were built by Sneferu (2572-2551 BC), the founder of theFourth Dynasty and the father of Khufu. In other words the Bent and the RedPyramids were indeed built before any of the great Pyramids of Giza[567][index_split_036.html#filepos875324]—which is exactly what one would expect ifthe drift of the vernal point into the Hyades-Taurus was the trigger that setthe whole enterprise in motion.And there is something else.Journey in timeThe Hyades-Taurus region, together with its terrestrial analogue, is identifiedin the Pyramid Texts as the starting point for the Horus-King’s ‘quest’—i.e.that great dualistic journey, enacted both in the sky and on the ground, that wedescribed in Part III. As the reader will recall, the texts specifically andunambiguously instruct Horus in his solar form, i.e. the sun’s disc, to positionhimself at this starting point and thence to ‘go to Horakhti’, i.e. to voyageeastwards towards the constellation of Leo. And we have seen how the sunactually does this, sailing along the ecliptic path during the solar year in thedirection Taurusà Geminià Cancerà Leo.This order of the constellations therefore appears to define ‘forward’ movementin time and, at one level, the identifiable astronomical events described in thetexts do indeed unfold in the ‘normal’ forward direction of the solar year(after being stationed near Taurus, and then crossing the Milky Way, the sunreaches Leo later in the year—i.e. later in time). Moreover this same ‘normal’forward motion also appears to be mirrored in the ritual performed by theHorus-King on the ground: i.e. after crossing the river Nile it is inevitablethat the initiate will arrive at the breast of the Great Sphinx somewhat laterin time.But in the Pyramid Texts, and in the arrangement of the Giza monuments—as in somuch else that has come down to us from ancient Egypt—everything may not bequite what it seems. An awareness of the effects of precession on the part ofthe ‘Followers of Horus’ (and the later priests of Heliopolis) would haveincluded an intense focus on the stellar background at the vernal equinox and anunderstanding that the sun’s ‘journey’ towards Horakhti-Leo, as calibrated atthis ‘governing moment ‘ of the year, would by definition have been a journeybackwards in time through a succession of ‘world-ages’—i.e. from the Age ofTaurus, circa 3000 BC (when the sun on the vernal equinox rose against thestellar background of the constellation of Taurus) to the Age of Leo, circa10,500 BC, when the sun on the vernal equinox rose against the background of thecelestial lion.So when we read in the Pyramid Texts that the ‘Followers of Horus’ are urgingthe Horus-King to travel from Taurus to Leo it is possible that they may havehad in mind something rather complex and clever. It is possible, in other words,that as well as offering the sun’s annual path through the constellations as akind of ‘treasure trail’ for the initiate to follow on his way to the breast ofthe Sphinx, they may also have offered him knowledge of its slow reverse motionat the vernal equinox—perhaps as his cue to embark on a different kind ofjourney, against the flow of precession and back to the ‘First Time’.This is more than speculation. As we saw at the end of Part III, theHorus-King’s journey to the breast of the Sphinx was undertaken at the summersolstice during the Pyramid Age (because in that epoch it was at the summersolstice that the great conjunction of the sun with Horakhti-Leo occurred). Wealso saw, however, that the initiate who had correctly followed the ‘treasuretrail’ set out in the texts, and who had reached the Sphinx in the pre-dawn onthe summer solstice, would immediately have become aware of a curious‘dislocation’ between sky and ground. He would have noticed, in particular, thatthe Sphinx gazed due east but that his celestial counterpart—Horakhti-Leo—wasrising at a point on the horizon located some 28 degrees north of due east. Hewould also have noticed that the three great Pyramids of Giza preciselystraddled the meridian but that their terrestrial counterparts, the three starsof Orion’s belt, hung low in the south-eastern portion of the pre-dawn sky, farto the left of the meridian.Given the profoundly astronomical character of his religious frame of referencehe might well have felt a numinous urge to ‘put sky and ground togetheragain’—i.e., so to arrange matters that the Sphinx would be gazing directly atLeo in the pre-dawn, whilst, at the same moment, the three stars of Orion’s beltwould straddle the meridian in the precise pattern ‘specified’ by the meridionallayout of the Pyramids. If that could somehow be brought about then themonuments would truly represent ‘an image of heaven’[568][index_split_036.html#filepos875464]—as the old Hermetic doctrines teach—and theland of Egypt ‘which once was holy, a land which loved the gods and whereinalone the gods deigned to sojourn on earth’, might once again become, as it wasbefore, ‘the teacher of Mankind’.[569] [index_split_036.html#filepos875606]But how could the Horus-King hope to unite sky and ground?The only way would be if he were equipped to use precession—presumably just asan intellectual tool—to travel backwards in time.For as the reader will recall there was a time when a unique celestialconjunction involving the moment of sunrise, the constellation of Leo, and themeridian-transit of the three stars of Orion’s belt, did indeed occur. Thattime, of course, was near the beginning of the Age of Leo, at around 10,500BC,[570] [index_split_036.html#filepos875704] some 8000 years prior to thePyramid Age.Becoming equippedThe Utterances conventionally numbered 471, 472 and 473 in the ancient EgyptianPyramid Texts contain information of an extraordinary nature. In view of theimportance of this information, we set it out in full below:I am the essence of a god, the son of a god, the messenger of a god, [says theHorus-King]. The Followers of Horus cleanse me, they bathe me, they dry me, theyrecite for me the Spell [formula] for Him who is on the Right Way, they recitefor me the Spell of Him who Ascends, and I ascend to the sky.I will go aboard this Bark of Re [the Solar Bark]... Every god will rejoice atmeeting me as they rejoice at meeting Re [the sun] when he ascends from theeastern side of the sky in peace, in peace.The sky quivers, the earth quakes before me, for I am a magician, I possessmagic ... I have come that I may glorify Orion, that I may set Osiris at thehead, that I may set the gods upon their thrones.O Mahaf, Bull of the gods [Taurus-Hyades], bring me this [solar bark] and set meon yonder side ... The reed-floats of the sky are set down for me by theday-bark that I [the solar Horus-King] may go up on them to Re at the Horizon.The reed floats of the sky are brought down to me by the night bark that I maygo up on them to Horakhti at the horizon. I go up on the eastern side of the skywhere the gods are born, and I am born as Horus, as Him of the Horizon ... Ihave found the Akhus with their mouths equipped ...‘Who are you?’ say they [the Akhus], with their mouths equipped.‘I am an Akhu with my mouth equipped.’‘How has this happened to you,’ say they, the Akhus with their mouths equipped,‘that you have come to this place more noble than any place?’‘I have come to this place more noble than any place because: The reed-floats ofthe sky were set down for Re [the sun disc and the emblem of the Horus-King]that Re might cross [the Milky Way] on them to Horakhti at the Horizon ...’[571][index_split_036.html#filepos875813][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image056.jpg]56. Artist’s impression of the unique celestial conjunction that occurred atsunrise on the vernal equinox in the epoch of 10,500 BC.These Utterances appear to describe an important part of the Horus-King’sinitiatory journey—an ordeal of questions and answers based on astronomicalscience wrapped up in esoteric symbols. The inquisitors are the ‘Followers ofHorus’, also known as the Akhus (the ‘Venerables’, the ‘Shining Ones’, the‘Transfigured Spirits’, etc., etc.). Moreover, as we would expect, theHorus-King’s cosmic journey begins in the Taurus-Hyades region of the sky, onthe right bank of the Milky Way. and proceeds along the ecliptic path to end atLeo i.e. ‘Horakhti’, at the horizon. Here, at ‘this place more noble than anyplace’, the Akhus greet him—indeed he claims to have become an Akhu himself—andgive him the final instructions or directions that he will need to complete hisquest.What we have to consider is the possibility that these final instructions mightsomehow have ‘equipped’ the Horus-King to make the necessary journey back intime, to the ‘First Time’, and into the cosmic Kingdom of Osiris when sky andground were united in perfect harmony.UnificationAs the reader will recall from the previous chapter, the ‘Followers of Horus’were said to have possessed ‘a knowledge of divine origin’ that was to be usedto ‘unify the country’. It is therefore presumably of relevance that largenumbers of ancient Egyptian inscriptions and papyri make reference to an eventknown as ‘the Uniting of the Two Lands’—an event that is eloquently related inthe so-called Shabaka Texts (the ‘Memphite Theology’) which we have reviewed inPart III.It is the scholarly consensus that the ‘Unification of the Two Lands’ was apolitical and economic ‘federation’ between southern and northern Egypt,resulting from the military conquest of the latter by the former, whichsupposedly occurred at around the year 3000 BC.[572][index_split_036.html#filepos875953] This conquest, as T. G. H. James informsus, ‘was effected by a King known to history as Menes. No contemporary monumentbears a royal name that can with certainty be read as Menes, but he is generallyidentified with King Narmer who is shown wearing both the red and white crowns[respectively of northern and southern Egypt] on a great palette [now in theCairo Museum]. With the unification of the Kingdoms begins the historic periodof Egypt.’[573] [index_split_036.html#filepos876103]Also sometimes referred to as ‘King Scorpion’ (after a symbol that appears on anarchaic mace-head) we have already met Menes-Narmer.[574][index_split_036.html#filepos876189] We have noted, too, the strangeEgyptological double standard by which he is accorded the status of a genuinehistorical figure whilst his predecessors—mentioned with equal prominence in theking-lists and Manetho—are dismissed as ‘mythical beings’.Indeed, Egyptologists speak with such immense confidence of ‘the politicalconsolidation of Egypt around 3000 BC’ and of the ‘unification underNarmer’[575] [index_split_036.html#filepos876340] that one would suppose theywere in possession of bundles upon bundles of ancient treaties, land deeds andhistorical records. The truth, however, as James half admits, is that nothing isknown for sure about the supposed first Pharaoh of the First Dynasty. On thecontrary, the whole of what we read about him, including his identification with‘Narmer’, is scholarly speculation based on idiosyncratic interpretations ofcertain scenes—some of which depict battles—that are carved on the so-called‘Narmer Palette’ and on certain votive mace-heads from Hierakonpolis (an ancientreligious capital in southern Egypt).[576] [index_split_036.html#filepos876479]In short, Egyptology’s case that ‘the Unification of the Two Lands’ refers tothe political unification of northern and southern Egypt under Menes rests onthree completely uninscribed artefacts which are carved with scenes that mightbear such an interpretation—but that could also be interpreted in many otherways. These curious artefacts tell us precious little about Menes-Narmerhimself,[577] [index_split_036.html#filepos876630] let alone what his politicaland territorial aspirations—or those of anybody else—might have been circa 3000BC in Egypt. Semi-legendary or semi-historical, Narmer (or Menes or ‘KingScorpion’—take your pick) is thus the quintessential ‘King Arthur’ ofEgyptology. And so, too, is his supposed ‘Unification of Egypt’—which is alsoveiled in semi-mythical, semi-historical confusion, very much like theconfederation of King Arthur’s Round Table.[578][index_split_036.html#filepos878045]Moreover the conclusion that Menes-Narmer was the first ruler to have beeninvolved in the ‘Unification of the Two Lands’ clashes rudely with the beliefsof the ancient Egyptians themselves. Their records and traditions make it clearthat there had been earlier ‘Unifications’ in the ‘Time of the Gods’—all goingback to the original Kingdom of Osiris, the ‘Kingdom of the “First Time” ’ whichwas torn asunder by Seth and then unified once again by Horus.We do not think that this talk of ‘Unification’ was ever entirely to do withevents that happened on the ground. Although we do not dispute that some form ofpolitical unification did indeed take place at around 3000 BC, we suspect thatin dualistic Egypt a wider understanding of the whole issue will not be possibleunless events in the sky are taken into account as well. Building on earlierwork done by Egyptologist and archaeoastronomer Jane B. Sellers,[579][index_split_036.html#filepos878275] we suggest that the original notion of‘Unification’—to which all later attempts to ‘Unify the Two Lands’ were directlyrelated—had something to do with the precessional drift of the stars ...High and far-off timesIn her landmark study The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt Sellers sets outpersuasive astronomical and textual evidence to show that the prehistoricEgyptians—at least as far back as 7300 BC—had observed and tracked the slowprecessionally induced changes that constantly relocate the cosmic ‘address’ ofthe constellation of Orion. And she argues that, although political unity wascredited to Menes, there was a much older notion of the ‘Unification’ based noton events on earth but those observed in the sky ...[580][index_split_036.html#filepos878435] Indeed, she goes so far as to claim thatMenes merely brought to fruition a very ancient and archetypal vision of cosmicduality which so perfectly harmonized with the mentality of the ancientEgyptians ‘as to appear both inevitable and perennial’: ‘A dual monarchy unitedunder the rule of one was a form that came from the mists of distant antiquity.It was a form that had been created for gods in the heavens, and how inevitableit was that an imitation of the cosmic order should prevail for men onearth.’[581] [index_split_036.html#filepos878529]Sellers supports her case by drawing on the late Henri Frankfort’s studies ofancient Egyptian kingship. Like her, the former Professor of PreclassicalAntiquity at the University of London was firmly of the opinion that it was‘possible to view the unification of Egypt, not as the ephemeral outcome ofconflicting ambitions, but as the revelation of a predestined order’.[582][index_split_036.html#filepos878623] And he was further convinced that ‘the dualmonarchy centred round Memphis realized a divine plan’, that the social andstate order established by Menes-Narmer was presented ‘as part of the cosmicorder’,[583] [index_split_036.html#filepos878771] and that Menes-Narmer, inestablishing himself as sole ruler of Upper and Lower Egypt, was performing ‘anact in harmony with the Egyptian tendency to understand the world in dualisticterms, “a series of pairs of contrasts balanced in unchanging equilibrium”...’[584] [index_split_036.html#filepos878865]What Sellers was able to add to this, as a result of her own powerful insightsinto ancient Egyptian cosmology and observational astronomy, was the notion thatevents taking place on the ground were somehow directly conditioned byobservations of the sky—and also that what was observed in the sky was describedmore or less accurately in certain ‘myths’:I am postulating the creation of specific myths to deal with distressingalterations in the sky, followed by an artificial duality, or symmetry, imposed,not just on the deities, but on geographical centres of worship, and thisduality remained a constant in Egyptian affairs throughout its history. It washarking back to a wonderful Golden Age, now lost, an age when the skies had hada magnificent balance, and the religion had been fresh and new ...’[585][index_split_036.html#filepos878959]The Golden Age to which Sellers is referring is, of course, Zep Tepi, the ‘FirstTime’. And the ‘distressing alterations in the sky’ which she believes thatcertain myths were created to explain were caused by the phenomenon ofprecession—specifically the precessional drift of the great constellation ofOrion away from the station that it had occupied at the ‘First Time’.[586][index_split_036.html#filepos879087]These are daring and dangerous steps for an otherwise orthodox Egyptologist tohave taken. Nevertheless, as we shall see in the next chapters, Sellers could bewrong in understanding the myths—by which she means principally the PyramidTexts and the Memphite Theology—merely as accounts fabricated by superstitiouspriests to ‘explain’ precessional drift. The possibility needs to be confrontedsquare on that elements of these ancient traditions, and the monuments andrituals that are so inextricably linked to them, could have been deliberatelycontrived as vehicles to carry an elaborate and ingenious ‘message’ from a pastepoch otherwise long forgotten to a specific epoch in the future—from the ‘FirstTime’ to an astronomically defined ‘Last Time’[587][index_split_036.html#filepos880700]—perhaps even to the very epoch in which weourselves live today. Perhaps both epochs thus linked together are susceptibleto accurate dating and decoding if only the right key can be found. And perhapswe may yet be able to read and understand the great cosmic blueprint that the‘Followers of Horus’ sought to implement ...Who knows what might result?There might even come, to quote the words of Giorgio de Santillana, ‘some kindof “Renaissance” out of the hopelessly condemned and trampled past, when certainideas come to life again ... We should not deprive our grandchildren of a lastchance at the heritage of the highest and farthest-off times.’[588][index_split_036.html#filepos881008]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15> > When the Sky Joined the Earth‘My Kingdom is not of this world. ...’John 18:36‘Great is the Cosmic Order, for it has not changed since the time of Osiris, whoput it there ...’Ptahotep, a high priest of the Pyramid AgeAccording to the Creation narrative of the ancient Egyptians, Nut, theSky-goddess, and Geb, the earth-god, joined in sexual union, but were thenrudely separated by the intervention of Shu, the god of air, atmosphere anddryness. Nevertheless the union did produce offspring in the form of Isis andOsiris, Nepthys and Seth. And in due course, as we have seen, Osiris became theruler of the idealized ‘Kingdom of the “First Time” ’, was murdered by Seth,experienced resurrection, and then finally ascended into the heavens where heestablished the cosmic ‘Kingdom’ of the Duat. The reader will remember that acrucial role in effecting his ‘astral rebirth’ was played by Horus, his son bythe widow Isis, the archetype for all the historical Horus-Kings of ancientEgypt—who revenged himself on Seth and later reunified the divided Kingdom.It can thus be said that a kind of cosmic blueprint to establish—orreestablish—a unified ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ on earth had been devised from theoutset by the ‘gods’ and thus long before the advent of ‘historical’ kingship byMenes-Narmer at the beginning of the third millennium BC.SeparationIn the Shabaka Texts (which express the Memphite Theology) we read that thedefeat of Seth by Horus was followed by a convocation of the gods, under theleadership of Geb, who sat in judgement over the two ‘contenders’. Initiallyeach one was given authority to rule over his own area: ‘These are the words ofGeb to Horus [of the north] and Seth [of the south]: “I have separatedyou”—Lower and Upper Egypt ... Then Horus stood over one region and Seth stoodover one region ...’[589] [index_split_036.html#filepos881175]Later, however, as the reader will recall from Part III, Geb ‘gave to Horus[Seth’s] inheritance’: ‘Then Horus stood over the land. He is the uniter of thisland ... He is Horus who arose as king of Upper and Lower Egypt, who united theTwo Lands in [the region of Memphis],—the “place” where the Two Lands wereunited ...’[590] [index_split_036.html#filepos881353]The curious phrase ‘I have separated you’ which Geb uttered, is symbolic of the‘separation’ that he, too, had endured from his consort the sky-goddess, Nut.With this in mind, should we not consider the possibility that the notions of‘Upper Egypt’ and ‘Lower Egypt’—though obviously relating at one level to thegeographical south and north of the earthly country—might also at another levelhave been intended to suggest ground and sky?DoublesThere is much in the Memphite Theology which supports the proposition that theareas which were traditionally regarded as the southern and northern sacredregions of Osiris—Abydos and Memphis—were not only meant to be considered interrestrial terms but also in cosmic terms.In particular, a metaphor is relayed around the imagery of the huge ‘body’ ofOsiris ‘drifting’ with the waters of the Nile from his southern shrine at Abydosto reach his northern shrine in the ‘land of Sokar’—i.e. the Memphite necropolisin general and in particular the Giza plateau where, in the form of the threegreat Pyramids, we suspect that the ‘body’ of Osiris lies outstretched upon thesand to the present day ...At any rate, this same basic imagery of Osiris lying on the western bank of theNile near Memphis also crops up in the Pyramid Texts, which add a further clue:‘They [Isis and Nepthys] have found Osiris ... “when his name became Sokar”...’[591] [index_split_036.html#filepos881450] The term ‘when his name becameSokar’ does clearly seem to imply that the ‘body’ of Osiris merged with the landof Sokar i.e. the Memphite necropolis, and that his image—i.e. the ‘astral’image of the Orion region of the sky—was somehow grafted onto it. The impressionthat this ‘image’ must have something to do with the Pyramids of Giza is thenconfirmed elsewhere in the Pyramid Texts. In the following passage, for example,the Horus-King addresses the ‘Lower Sky’ to which he ‘will descend to the placewhere the gods are’ and utters this powerful and cryptic declaration:If I come with my ka [double], open your arms to me; the mouths of the gods willbe opened and will request that I ascend to the sky, and I will ascend.A boon which Geb (earth) and Atum grant: that this Pyramid and Temple beinstalled for me and for my double, and that this Pyramid and Temple be enclosedfor me and for my double ...As for anyone who shall lay a finger on this Pyramid and this Temple whichbelong to me and to my double, he will have laid a finger on the Mansion[Kingdom]... which is in the sky ...[592] [index_split_036.html#filepos881584]It is beyond the scope of this book to present a detailed treatise on theconcept of the ka—the ‘double’, the astral or spiritual essence of a person orthing—and of its role in ancient Egyptian funerary beliefs. Much confusion hasbeen generated around this important subject.[593][index_split_036.html#filepos881685] At the very least, however, it is certainthat what confronts us in the ka is yet another example of the prevailingdualism in Egyptian thought. Moreover its use in context of the utterance quotedabove reminds us that the ‘image’ of Osiris ‘when his name became Sokar’—i.e.the Memphite Pyramid necropolis—should at all times be considered as having acosmic or celestial ‘double’. And it should be obvious, too, that this ‘double’can only be the Osirian Kingdom in the Duat—which the Pyramid Texts declare tobe ‘the Place Where Orion Is’. Indeed as Margaret Bunson notes in herEncyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt: ‘Kas ... served as guardians of places ...Osiris was always called the ka of the Pyramids ...’[594][index_split_036.html#filepos881857]Other passages from the Pyramid Texts support this general analysis:O Horus, this King is Osiris, this Pyramid of the king is Osiris, thisconstruction of his is Osiris, betake yourself to it ...[595][index_split_036.html#filepos881943]Awake [Osiris] for Horus ... spiritualize yourself [i.e. become an astral being]...

Sellers[599][index_split_036.html#filepos882396] has ever given serious consideration to thepossibility that references to the ‘Unification’ of the ‘Upper’ and ‘Lower’Kingdoms of Osiris might have something to do with astronomy. Indeed the onlyEgyptologist even to get close to such an unorthodox way of thinking was SelimHassan when he observed: ‘the Egyptians held the idea of the existence of morethan one sky, possibly superimposed ... Certain lines in the Pyramid Textsstrongly suggest that “Upper” and “Lower” Egypt each had its own particular sky... i.e. the two skies in opposition to the Two Lands of Upper and LowerEgypt.’[600] [index_split_036.html#filepos882527]In his monumental study of ancient Egyptian cosmology, Hassan also drewattention to an intriguing papyrus, now kept at the Louvre Museum in Paris,[601][index_split_036.html#filepos882670] which suggests that the ‘Two Skies’ inquestion were considered as being ‘one for the earth and the other for theDuat’.[602] [index_split_036.html#filepos882768] ‘These plural skies’, wroteHassan, ‘were superimposed one above the other.’[603][index_split_036.html#filepos882909]Pursuing such lines of thought, we were to discover that similar ideas aredepicted in the Coffin Texts. There reference is made to the ‘Upper’ and ‘Lower’landscapes which are said to be bound to the ‘Two Horizons’—one in the east (thesky) and one in the west (the earth i.e. the Memphite necropolis[604][index_split_036.html#filepos883035]): ‘Open! O Sky and Earth, O eastern andwestern Horizons, open you chapels of Upper and Lower Egypt ...’[605][index_split_036.html#filepos883692]The language of all these texts is exotic, laden with the dualistic thinkingthat lay at the heart of ancient Egyptian society and that may have been theengine of its greatest achievements. In the Pyramid Age, as we have seen, thegigantic ‘image’ of Osiris appears to have been physically defined on the groundwith the creation of the ‘Lower’ landscape of the Memphite Pyramids—adevelopment referred to in the Pyramid Texts by means of the obvious metaphor‘When his name became Sokar’. Likewise, it should come as no surprise that thegigantic celestial ‘image’ of Osiris in the sky is referred to in the same textsby means of the same metaphorical device, i.e. ‘When his name became Orion’:‘Horus comes, Thoth appears ... They raise Osiris from upon his side and makehim stand up ... when there came into being this his name of Orion, long of legand lengthy of stride, who presides over “Upper” Egypt ... Raise yourself, OOsiris ... the sky is given to you, the earth is given to you ...’[606][index_split_036.html#filepos883892] Selim Hassan, again almost but not quitegetting the point, comments as follows: ‘this line shows that Osiris was giventhe dominion of heaven and earth.’[607] [index_split_036.html#filepos884027][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image057.jpg]57. (Left) The sky-Duat of Osiris ‘in his name of Orion’. (Right) Theground-Duat of Osiris ‘in his name of Sokar’.Yet clearly there is more to say. These ‘dominions’ were by no means vague andgeneral but were defined in the sky by the pattern of Orion’s stars, and weredefined on the ground—in the land of ‘Sokar’ (i.e. the Memphite necropolis)—bythe pattern of the Pyramids.We wonder whether the first major ‘station’ of the quest-journey of theHorus-King, reached after he had been prompted to ‘find the astral body ofOsiris’, might not have been the initiate’s dawning awareness that the body inquestion was a duality that could only be approached by linking Orion with thepattern of the Great Pyramids in the Memphite necropolis.Riding the vernal pointThe reader will remember that the starting point of the Horus-King’s ‘journey inthe sky’ was when the sun’s position along the zodiac (during the solar year)was close to the Hyades, at the ‘head’ of the constellation of Taurus, standing,as it were, on the banks of the Milky Way.If we now transpose this sky image to the ground then the Horus-King would haveto place himself near the ‘Bent’ and the ‘Red’ Pyramids of Dahshur some 20 milessouth of Giza (but nevertheless still very much part of the extensive Memphitenecropolis). As we saw in the last chapter, the trigger for the construction ofthese two Fourth-Dynasty monuments appears to have been the slow precessionaldrift of the vernal point into the Hyades-Taurus region of the sky in the thirdmillennium BC. Indeed it is more than possible that by building those Pyramids(which map the two brightest stars in the Hyades) Pharaoh Sneferu (2575-2551 BC)was deliberately laying down a marker for the position of the vernal point inhis epoch.If he was doing that, as all the evidence seems to suggest, then it is probablethat such a highly initiated Horus-King would also have known that bymetaphorically ‘boarding’ the solar bark at the spring equinox, and crossing theMilky Way, he would effectively be ‘sailing back in time’—against the flow ofprecession—riding the vernal point towards the distant constellation of Leo.But why, then, all this parallel emphasis in the texts on Orion-Osiris movingfrom somewhere in the distant ‘south’ to his final resting place in the Memphitenecropolis?Secret spellWe suspect that for thousands of years before the Pyramid Age, hundreds ofgenerations of Heliopolitan astronomer-priests had kept the constellation ofOrion continuously under observation, paying particular attention to its placeof meridian-transit—i.e. the altitude above the horizon at which it crossed thecelestial meridian. We think that careful records were kept, perhaps written,perhaps orally encoded in the ancient ‘mythological’ language of precessionalastronomy.[608] [index_split_036.html#filepos884161] And we suppose that notewas taken of Orion’s slow precessional drift—the effect of which was that theconstellation would have seemed to be slowly drifting northwards along the west‘bank’ of the Milky Way.It is our hypothesis that the mythical image of the vast body of Osiris slowlybeing carried to the north, i.e. ‘drifting’ on the waters of the Nile, is aspecific piece of astronomical terminology coined to describe the long-termchanges being effected by precession in Orion’s celestial ‘address’. In theMemphite Theology, as the reader will recall, this drift was depicted as havingcommenced in the south, symbolically called Abydos (in archaeological terms themost southerly ‘shrine’ of Osiris), and to have carried the ‘body’ of the deadgod to a point in the north symbolically called Sokar, i.e. the Memphitenecropolis (the most northerly ‘shrine’ of Osiris). As we saw in Part III, theShabaka Texts tell us that when he reached this point:Osiris was drowned in his water. Isis and Nepthys looked out, beheld him, andattended to him. Horus quickly commanded Isis and Nepthys to grasp Osiris andprevent his [submerging]. They heeded in time and brought him to land. [. Heentered the hidden portals in the glory of the Lords of Eternity. Thus Osiriscame into the earth at the Royal Fortress [Memphis], to the north of the land towhich he had come [Abydos].[609] [index_split_036.html#filepos884446][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image058.jpg]58. The effect of Orion’s slow precessional slide up the meridian between 10,500BC and 2500 BC is that the constellation would literally have appeared to be‘drifting’ very slowly northwards along the course of the Milky Way.In the light of what we now know it is hard to imagine that the reference toOsiris coming ‘into the earth’ (or down to earth?) could signify anything otherthan the physical construction of the ‘body of Osiris on the ground’ on the westbanks of the Nile—in the form of the great Pyramid-fields of the sprawlingMemphite necropolis. Since Osiris is Orion the desire to achieve such an effectwould more than adequately explain why the three Pyramids of Giza should havebeen arranged in the pattern of the three stars of Orion’s belt. Moreover, sincewe know that the stated goal of the Horus-King’s quest was not only to find theastral ‘body’ of Osiris but to find it as it was in the ‘First Time’, we shouldnot be surprised by the fact that the Pyramids, as we saw in Part I, are set outon the ground in the pattern that they made at the beginning (i.e. ‘southernmostpoint’) of that constellation’s upward (i.e. ‘northerly’) precessionalhalf-cycle.So we wonder whether it is possible that the quest of the Horus-King might havehad as its ultimate objective the acquisition of knowledge concerning the ‘FirstTime’—perhaps even the acquisition of specific knowledge from that remote epochwhen the gods had walked the earth?Several passages in the Pyramid Texts invite such speculation. For example, weare told that the Horus-King must ‘travel upstream’—i.e. must push against thenatural drift of ‘time’—in order to reach Orion-Osiris in his proper ‘FirstTime’ setting:Betake yourself to the Waterway, fare upstream [south], travel about Abydos inthis spirit-form of yours which the gods command to belong to you; may astairway [road] to the Duat be set up for you to the Place Where Orion Is...[610] [index_split_036.html#filepos884601]They have found Osiris ... ‘When his name became Sokar’ [Memphite necropolis]... Wake up [Osiris] for Horus ... raise yourself ... fare southward [upstream]to the lake, cross over the sea [sky], for you are he who stands untiring in themidst of Abydos ...[611] [index_split_036.html#filepos884736]Betake yourself to the Waterway, fare upstream ... traverse Abydos. Thecelestial portal to the Horizon is open to you ... may you remove yourself tothe sky, for the roads of the celestial expanses which lead up to Horus arecleaned for you ... for you have traversed the Winding Waterway [Milky Way]which is in the north of the sky as a star crossing the sea which is beneath thesky. The Duat has grasped your hand at the Place Where Orion Is ...[612][index_split_036.html#filepos884846]Likewise there is a striking passage in the Coffin Texts which refers to somesecret ‘spell’ or formula to allow the deceased to use the ‘path of Rostau’ onthe land and in the sky (i.e. the path to the Giza necropolis on land and toOrion’s belt in the sky) in order to ‘go down to any sky he wishes to go downto’:I have passed on the path of Rostau, whether on water or on land, and these arethe paths of Osiris [Orion], they are in the limit of the sky. As for him whoknows the spell [formula] for going down into them, he himself is a god in thesuite of Thoth [meaning he is as wise as Thoth, ‘the controller of thestars’[613] [index_split_036.html#filepos884950]] [and] he will go down to anysky he wishes to go down to ...[614] [index_split_036.html#filepos885149]Special numbersWe suspect that the phrase to ‘go down to any sky’ suggests an awareness—andrecording—of precessionally induced changes in the positions of the stars overlong periods of time. And we also note its implication that if the choseninitiate was equipped with the correct numerical spell then he would be able towork out—and visualize—the correct positions of the stars in any epoch of hischoosing, past or future.Once again Sellers stands out amongst Egyptologists for being the first to haveentertained such apparently outlandish notions. ‘It is possible’, she writes,‘that early man encoded in his myths special numbers; numbers that seemed toreveal to initiates an amazing knowledge of the movement of the celestialspheres.’[615] [index_split_036.html#filepos885582]Such numbers, she argues, appear to have been derived from a sustained,scientific study of the cycle of precession and a measurement of its rate and,puzzlingly, turn out to be extremely ‘close to the calculations made withtoday’s sophisticated procedures’. Intriguingly, too, there is evidence not only‘that these calculations were made, and conclusions drawn’, but also that ‘theywere transmitted to others by secret encoding that was accessible only to anélite few’:[616] [index_split_036.html#filepos885711] In short, Sellersconcludes, ‘ancient man calculated a special number that he believed would bringthis threatening cycle [of precession] back to its starting point ...’[617][index_split_036.html#filepos885806]The ‘special number’ to which Sellers is referring to is 25,920 (and multiplesand divisions of it) and thus represents the duration, in solar years, of a fullprecessional cycle or ‘Great Year’.[618] [index_split_036.html#filepos885892]She shows how it can be derived from a variety of simple combinations of othernumbers—5, 12, 36, 72, 360, 432, 2160, etc., etc.—all of which are in turnderived from precise observations of precession. Most crucially of all, sheshows that this peculiar sequence of numbers occurs in the ancient Egyptian mythof Osiris where, notably ‘72 conspirators’ are said to have been involved withSeth in the murder of the God-King.[619] [index_split_036.html#filepos886054]As was shown in Fingerprints of the Gods, the sun’s perceived motion through thesigns of the zodiac at the vernal equinox proceeds at the rate of one degreeevery seventy-two years. From this it follows that a movement of the vernalpoint through 30 degrees will take 2160 years to complete, 60 degrees will take4320 years, and a full 360-degree cycle will require 25,920 years.[620][index_split_036.html#filepos886198]Curiously enough, as the reader will recall from Part I, the Great Pyramiditself incorporates a record of these precessional numbers—since its keydimensions (its height and the perimeter of its base) appear to have beendesigned as a mathematical model of the earth’s polar radius and equatorialcircumference on a scale of 1:43,200. The number 43,200 is, of course, exactly600 times 72. What we have in this remarkable monument, therefore, is not just ascale model of a hemisphere of the earth but also one in which the scaleinvolved incorporates a ‘special number’ derived from one of the key planetarymotions of the earth itself—i.e. the rate of its axial precession.In short it seems that secret knowledge is indeed available in the myth ofOsiris and in the dimensions of the Great Pyramid. With this secret knowledge,if we wanted to fix a specific date—say 1008 years in the future—and communicateit to other initiates, then we could do so with the ‘special number’ 14 (72 x 14= 1008). We would also have to specify the ‘zero point’ from which they were tomake their calculations—i.e. the present epoch—and this might be done with somekind of symbolic or mathematical marker to indicate where the vernal pointpresently is, i.e. moving out of Pisces and into Aquarius.A similar exercise could likewise be carried out in reverse. By following the‘eastwards’ direction along the ecliptic path we can ‘find’ (calculate, workout) where the vernal point was at any epoch in the past. Thus if today wewished to use the precessional code to direct attention towards the Pyramid Agewe would need to confide to other initiates the ‘special number’ of 62.5 (72 x62.5 = 4500 years ago = approximately 2500 BC). Again, we could rule out anyambiguity as to the zero date from which the calculations were to be made if wecould find a way to indicate the present position of the vernal point.We have seen that this is what Sneferu appears to have done with the twoPyramids at Dahshur, which map the two sides of the head of the celestialbull—the ‘address’ of the vernal point in his epoch. And in a sense, though witha great deal more specificity and precision, this could also be exactly what thebuilders of the Great Pyramid were doing when they deliberately targeted thesouthern shafts of the King’s and Queen’s Chambers on the meridian-transits ofsuch significant stars as Orion and Sirius in the epoch of 2500 BC. To be clearabout this, it seems to us well worth investigating the possibility that bysetting up such obvious and precise ‘time markers’ they were trying to providean unambiguous zero point—circa 2500 BC—for calculations that could only beundertaken by initiates steeped in the mysteries of precession, who wereequipped by their training to draw out the hidden portents concealed in certain‘special numbers’.We note in passing that if the Horus-King could have been provided with the‘special number’ 111.111, and had used it in the way described above, it wouldhave led him back to (72 x 111.111 years =) 7,999.99 years before the specified‘ground zero’, i.e. to almost exactly 8000 years before 2500 BC—in short, to10,500 BC.We know this seems like wishful numerology of the worst sort—i.e. ‘factoring in’an arbitrary value to a set of calculations so as to procure spurious‘corroboration’ for a specific desired date (in this case the date of 10,500 BC,twelve and a half thousand years before the present, that we have alreadyhighlighted in Chapter 3 in connection with the Sphinx and the Pyramids ofGiza). The problem, however, is that the number 111.111 may well not be anarbitrary value. At any rate, it has long been recognized that the mainnumerical factor in the design of the Great Pyramid, and indeed of the Gizanecropolis as a whole, is the prime number 11—a prime number being one that isonly divisible by itself to produce the whole number 1. Thus 11 divided by 11,i.e. the ratio 11:11, produces the whole number 1 (while 11 divided by anythingelse, i.e. any other ratio, would, of necessity, generate a fraction).What is intriguing is the way that the architecture of the Great Pyramidresponds to the number 11 when it is divided, or multiplied, by other wholenumbers. The reader will recall, for example, that its side length of just over755 feet is equivalent to 440 Egyptian royal cubits—i.e. 11 times 40cubits.[621] [index_split_036.html#filepos886347] In addition, itsheight-to-base ratio is 7:11.[622] [index_split_036.html#filepos886504] Theslope ratio of its sides is 14:11 (tan 51 degrees 50’).[623][index_split_036.html#filepos886729] And the slope ratio of the southern shaftof the King’s Chamber—the shaft that was targeted on Orion’s belt in 2500 BC—is11:11 (tan 45 degrees).[624] [index_split_036.html#filepos886824]Arguably, therefore, the ratio 11:11, which integrates with our ‘special number’111.111, could be considered as a sort of mathematical key, or ‘stargate’ toOrion’s belt. Moreover, as we shall see, a movement of 111.111 degrees‘backwards along the ecliptic from ‘ground-zero’ at the Hyades-Taurus, the headof the celestial bull, would place the vernal point ‘underneath’ the cosmiclion.Is it not precisely such a location, underneath the Great Sphinx, that theHorus-King is urged to investigate as he stands between its paws ‘with his mouthequipped’ and faces the questions of the Akhus whose initiations have led himthis far? Indeed, does it not seem probable that the ‘quest-journey’ devised bythe ‘Followers of Horus’ was carefully structured so as to sharpen the mind ofthe initiate by requiring him to piece together all the clues himself until hefinally arrived at the realization that somewhere underneath the Great Sphinx ofGiza was something (written or pictorial records, artefacts, maps, astronomicalcharts) that touched on ‘the knowledge of a divine origin’, that was of immenseimportance, and that had been concealed there since the ‘First Time’?In considering such questions, we are reminded of the Hermetic doctrines whichtransmit a tradition of the wisdom god Thoth who was said to have ‘succeeded inunderstanding the mysteries of the heavens [and to have] revealed them byinscribing them in sacred books which he then hid here on earth, intending thatthey should be searched for by future generations but found only by the fullyworthy’.[625] [index_split_036.html#filepos886919] Do the ‘sacred books ofThoth’, or their equivalent, still lie in the bedrock beneath the Great Sphinxof Giza, and do the ‘fully worthy’ still seek them there?Seekers after truthOther questions, too, have been raised implicitly and explicitly in theforegoing chapters:1. Were the Great Sphinx and the great Pyramids of Giza designed to serveas parts of an immense three-dimensional ‘model’ of the sky of the ‘First Time’?2. Could other features of the necropolis also be part of this model?3. If so, then has enough survived for us to compare the model withcomputer simulations of the skies above Giza in previous epochs and thus arriveat an accurate archaeoastronomical dating for the ‘First Time’, i.e. for thetrue ‘genesis’ of the extraordinary civilization of Egypt?4. By looking at simulations of the ancient skies would we not, to usethe language of the Egyptian funerary texts, be ‘going down to any sky we wishedto go down to’?5. Is it an accident that so many of these texts have survived forthousands of years, or could their compilers have intended them to survive andcarefully designed them in such a way that human nature would ensure theircopying and recopying down the ages (a process that has been promiscuouslyresumed in the last century and a half, since the decipherment of the ancientEgyptian hieroglyphs, with the Coffin Texts, the Pyramid Texts, the Book of theDead, etc., etc., now translated and reprinted in dozens of modern languages andeditions—and even available on CD-ROM)?6. In other words, is it not possible in our readings of the texts, andin our analysis of the rituals to which they were linked, that we have stumbledupon a message of primordial antiquity that was composed not just for thePyramid Age, and not just for the Horus-Kings of ancient Egypt, but for all‘seekers after the truth’—from any culture, in any epoch—who might be ‘equipped’to put texts and monuments together and to view the skies of former times?"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16> > Message in a Bottle?‘We have reached this fascinating point in our evolution ... we have reached thetime when we know we can talk to each other across the distances between thestars ...’Dr. John Billingham, NASA Ames Research Center, 1995Together with the ancient texts and rituals that are linked to them, could thevast monuments of the Giza necropolis have been designed to transmit a messagefrom one culture to another—a message not across space, but across time?Egyptologists reply to such questions by rolling their eyes and hootingderisively. Indeed they would not be ‘Egyptologists’ (or at any rate they couldnot long remain within that profession) if they reacted with anything other thanscorn and disbelief to suggestions that the necropolis might be more than acemetery, that the Great Sphinx might significantly predate the epoch of 2500BC, and that the Pyramids might not be just ‘royal tombs’. By the same token, noself-respecting Egyptologist would be prepared to consider, even for a moment,the outlandish possibility that some sort of mysterious ‘message’ might havebeen encoded into the monuments.So whom should we turn to for advice when confronted by what we suspect may be amessage from a civilization so far distant from us in time as to be almostunknowable?Anti-cipherThe only scientists actively working on such problems today are those involvedin the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence—SETI for short. They endlesslysweep the heavens for messages from distant civilizations and they havetherefore naturally had to give some thought to what might happen if they everdid identify such a message. According to Dr. Philip Morisson of theMassachusetts Institute of Technology:To begin with we would know very little about it. If we received it we would notunderstand what we’re getting. But we would have an unmistakable signal, full ofstructure, full of challenge. The best people would try to decode it, and itwill be easy to do because those who have constructed it would have made it easyto decode, otherwise there’s no point. This is anti-cryptography: ‘I want tomake a message for you, who never got in touch with any symbols of mine, no keyno clue, nevertheless you’ll be able to read it ...’ I would have to fill itfull of clues and unmistakable clever devices ...[626][index_split_036.html#filepos887178]In his book, Cosmos, Professor Carl Sagan of Cornell University makes much thesame point—and does so, curiously enough, with reference to the ancient Egyptianhieroglyphic system. He explains that the ‘Egyptian hieroglyphics are, insignificant part, a simple substitution cipher. But not every hieroglyph is aletter or syllable. Some are pictographs ...’ When it came to translation, this‘mix of letters and pictographs caused some grief for interpreters ...’ In theearly nineteenth century, however, a breakthrough was made by the French scholarChampollion who deciphered the famous ‘Rosetta Stone’, a slab of black basaltbearing identical inscriptions in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in Greek. SinceChampollion could read the Greek, all he needed was some kind of ‘key’ to relatespecific hieroglyphs to specific Greek words or letters. This key was providedby the constant repetition in the Greek text of the name of Pharaoh Ptolemy Vand an equal number of repetitions in the Egyptian text of a distinctive oblongenclosure—known as a cartouche—containing a repeated group of hieroglyphs. AsSagan comments:The cartouches were the key ... almost as though the Pharaohs of Egypt hadcircled their own names to make the going easier for Egyptologists two thousandyears in the future ... What a joy it must have been [for Champollion] to openthis one-way communication channel with another civilization, to permit aculture that had been mute for millennia to speak of its history, magic,medicine, religion, politics and philosophy.[627][index_split_036.html#filepos887342]Professor Sagan then offers a comparison that is highly apposite to our presentinquiry. ‘Today,’ he says:we are again seeking messages from an ancient and exotic civilization, this timehidden from us not only in time, but in space. If we should receive a radiomessage from an extraterrestrial civilization, how could it possibly beunderstood? Extraterrestrial intelligence will be elegant, complex, internallyconsistent and utterly alien. Extraterrestrials would, of course, wish to make amessage sent to us as comprehensible as possible. But how could they? Is therein any sense an interstellar Rosetta Stone? We believe there is a commonlanguage that all technical civilizations, no matter how different, must have.That common language is science and mathematics. The laws of Nature are the sameeverywhere.[628] [index_split_036.html#filepos887493]It seems to us that if there is indeed a very ancient ‘message’ at Giza then itis likely to be expressed in the language of science and mathematics that Saganidentifies—and for the same reason. Moreover, given its need to continue‘transmitting’ coherently across thousands of years (and chasms of culturalchange), we think that the composer of such a message would be likely to makeuse of the Precession of the Equinoxes, the one particular ‘law of Nature’ thatcan be said to govern, and measure—and identify—long periods of terrestrialtime.Durable vehiclesThe Pyramids and the Great Sphinx at Giza are, above all else, as elegant, ascomplex, as internally consistent and as utterly ‘alien’ as the extraterrestrialintelligence that Sagan envisages (alien in the sense of the tremendous, almostsuperhuman scale of these structures and of their uncanny—and in our termsapparently unnecessary—precision).Moreover, returning briefly to Dr. Philip Morisson’s remarks quoted earlier, wethink that the Giza necropolis also qualifies rather well for the description‘packed full of clues and unmistakable clever devices’.[629][index_split_036.html#filepos887579] Indeed, it seems to us that a trulyastonishing quantum of ingenuity was invested by the Pyramid builders to ensurethat the four fundamental aspects of an ‘unmistakable’ message were thoroughlyelaborated here:1. the creation of durable, unequivocal markers which could serve asbeacons to inflame the curiosity and engage the intelligence of futuregenerations of seekers;2. the use of the ‘common language’ of precessional astronomy;3. the use of precessional co-ordinates to signal specific time-referentslinking past to present and present to future;4. Cunningly concealed store-rooms, or ‘Halls of Records’ that could onlybe found and entered by those who were fully initiated in the ‘silent language’and thus could read and follow its clues.In addition, though the monuments are enabled to ‘speak’ from the moment thattheir astronomical context is understood, we have also to consider the amazingprofusion of funerary texts that have come down to us from all periods ofEgyptian history—all apparently emanating from the same very few commonsources.[630] [index_split_036.html#filepos887785] As we have seen, these textsoperate like ‘software’ to the monuments’ ‘hardware’, charting the route thatthe Horus-King (and all other future seekers) must follow.We recall a remark made by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend inHamlet’s Mill to the effect that the great strength of myths as vehicles forspecific technical information is that they are capable of transmitting thatinformation independently of the knowledge of individual story-tellers.[631][index_split_036.html#filepos889032] In other words as long as a myth continuesto be told true, it will also continue to transmit any higher message that maybe concealed within its structure—even if neither the teller nor the hearerunderstands that message.So, too, we suspect, with the ancient Egyptian funerary texts. We would besurprised if the owners of many of the coffins and tomb walls onto which theywere copied had even the faintest inkling that specific astronomicalobservations and directions were being duplicated at their expense. Whatmotivated them was precisely what the texts offered—the lure of immortal life.Yet by taking that lure did they not in fact guarantee a kind of immortality forthe texts themselves? Did they not ensure that so many faithful copies would bemade that some at least would be bound to survive for many thousands of years?We think that there were always people who understood the true ‘science ofimmortality’ connected to the texts, and who were able to read the astronomicalallegories in which deeper secrets, not granted to the common herd, layconcealed. We presume that these people were once called the ‘Followers ofHorus’, that they operated as an invisible college behind the scenes in Egyptianprehistory and history, that their primary cult centre was at Giza-Heliopolis,and that they were responsible for the initiation of kings and the realizationof blueprints. We also think that the timetables they worked to—and almosteverything of significance that they did—was in one way or another written inthe stars.Hints and memoriesThe powerfully astronomical character of the Giza necropolis, although ignoredby Egyptologists, has been recognized by open-minded and intuitive researchersthroughout history. The Hermetic Neoplatonists of Alexandria, for example,appear to have been acutely sensitive to the possibility of a ‘message’ and werequick to discern the strong astral qualities of the textual material and themonuments.[632] [index_split_036.html#filepos889154] The scholar Proclus (fifthcentury AD) also acknowledged that the Great Pyramid was astronomicallydesigned—and with certain specific stars in mind. Indeed, in his commentary onPlato’s Timaeus (which deals with the story of the lost civilization of‘Atlantis’), Proclus reported strangely that ‘the Great Pyramid was used as anobservation for Sirius’.[633] [index_split_036.html#filepos889800]Vague memories of an astronomically constructed ‘message’ at Giza appear to havefiltered down to the Middle Ages. At any rate the Arab chroniclers in thisperiod spoke of the Great Pyramid as ‘a temple to the stars’ and frequentlyconnected it to the Biblical ‘Flood’ which they dated to circa 10,300 BC.[634][index_split_036.html#filepos889957] Also of relevance is a report written bythe Arab geographer Yakut al Hamawi (eleventh century AD) to the effect that thestar-worshippers of Harran, the Sabians (whose ‘holy books’ were supposedly thewritings of Thoth-Hermes) came at that time on special pilgrimages to thePyramids at Giza.[635] [index_split_036.html#filepos890216] It has also beenpointed out that the very name of the Sabians—in Arabic Sa’Ba—almost certainlyderived from the ancient Egyptian word for star, i.e. Sba.[636][index_split_036.html#filepos890416] And the reader will recall from Part I thatas far back as the early second millennium BC—i.e. almost three thousand yearsbefore Yakut al Hamawi left us his report connecting the Sabians to thePyramids—pilgrims from Harran are known to have visited the Sphinx which theyworshipped as a god under the name Hwl.[637][index_split_036.html#filepos890502]In the seventeenth century, the British mathematician Sir Isaac Newton becamedeeply interested in the Great Pyramid and wrote a dissertation on itsmathematical and geodetic qualities based on data that had been gathered at Gizaby Dr. John Greaves, the Savillian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford.[638][index_split_036.html#filepos890715] Later, in 1865 the Astronomer Royal ofScotland, Charles Piazzi Smyth, launched an investigation into the Great Pyramidwhich he was convinced was an instrument of prophecy that incorporated aMessianic ‘message’. It was Piazzi Smyth who first accurately measured anddemonstrated the intense polar and meridional alignments of the monument, theprecision of which he assigned to sightings of the ancient Pole star, AlphaDraconis.[639] [index_split_036.html#filepos890872]In the first half of the twentieth century, a succession of eminentastronomers—such as Richard Proctor, Eugene Antoniadi, Jean Baptiste Biot andNorman Lockyer—made persistent attempts to draw attention to the astronomicalqualities of the Giza monuments. Their efforts, however, had little impact onprofessional Egyptologists who by this time felt that they had got the wholeintellectual business of the necropolis ‘wrapped up’ (it was a cemetery), didnot understand astronomy at all (and claimed that the ancient Egyptians didn’teither), and routinely ganged up to debunk, deride or simply ignore anyastronomical ‘theories’ which diverged from their consensus.Despite this hostile intellectual climate, we are of the opinion at the end ofour own research that the big question is no longer whether the monuments ofGiza were designed to express key astronomical and mathematical principles, butwhy.Once again, the clue may lie in the narrow star-shafts of the Great Pyramid.The language of the starsThe first major breakthrough in understanding the function of the GreatPyramid’s shafts was made in the summer of 1963 by the American astronomerVirginia Trimble and the Egyptologist-architect, Dr. Alexander Badawy. It cameabout because they decided to follow up Badawy’s ‘hunch’ that the shafts mightnot be ‘ventilation channels’ as Egyptologists supposed,[640][index_split_036.html#filepos891014] but might instead prove to have a symbolicfunction related to the astral rituals of the Pyramid builders. Virginia Trimblewas able to buttress her colleague’s intuition by showing that the shafts fromthe King’s Chamber had pointed, in the epoch of 2500 BC, to major star systemsthat were of crucial importance to the Pyramid builders. As readers will recallfrom Part I, the northern shaft had been targeted on Alpha Draconis—the PoleStar in the Pyramid Age—and the southern shaft had been targeted on Orion’sbelt.[641] [index_split_036.html#filepos891331]Today Virginia Trimble is a senior professor of astronomy at UCLA and theUniversity of Maryland and is also the Vice-President of the AmericanAstronomical Society. Her views, as well as being enlightened by a comprehensivegrasp of astronomy, accord fully with common sense:Which constellations the Egyptians saw in the sky is still something of amystery ... but they had one constellation that was an erect standing man,Osiris, the god. And the one constellation that looks like a standing man toeveryone is Orion, and the identification between a deceased Pharaoh and the godOsiris made Orion immediately a candidate for a shaft whose sole purpose was toenable the soul of the Pharaoh to communicate between earth and sky ...[642][index_split_036.html#filepos891454]When we met Virginia Trimble we immediately realized we were in the presence ofan acute and formidable thinker. Alexander Badawy had passed away in the late1980s yet she remained undaunted. She had concluded that the shafts wereastronomically aligned, she said, and that they had an astronomical function,because logic and evidence dictated that this was the case.Trimble’s views have won general acceptance amongst senior astronomers. To giveone recent example, Dr. Mary Bruck of Edinburgh, writing in the Journal of theBritish Astronomical Association in 1995, had this to say about the shafts:‘Their alignments are ... compatible with the hypothesis that they indicate theculmination of certain important stars around the 25th century BC ... Theaddition of a Sirius shaft [southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber] to the Orionone strongly supports the claim that they have an astronomicalsignificance.’[643] [index_split_036.html#filepos891597]Thought-toolsWe suggest that one of the major objectives of the unseen academy, whose memberswere known as the ‘Followers of Horus’, was to ‘fix’ the epoch of 2500 BC (i.e.4500 years before the present) by using the Great Pyramid, its precisely angledshafts, and the stars of Orion’s belt. We suggest that they envisaged thosestars rather like the gauge of a gigantic sliding scale set across the southmeridian. Once this ‘thought-tool’ was in place all they needed to do in orderto determine a date either in the past or in the future was mentally to ‘slide’the belt up or down the meridian from the ‘zero point’ targeted by the southernshaft of the King’s Chamber.We also suggest that a second and somewhat similar ‘thought-tool’ was attachedto the ecliptic (the apparent annual path of the sun through the twelveconstellations of the zodiac). Here the gauge was the vernal point. By mentallysliding it to the left (east) or to the right (west) of a ‘fixed’ marker on theecliptic the ‘Followers of Horus’ would once again have been able to determineand denominate either a past date or a date in the future ...In our own epoch, circa AD 2000, the vernal point is poised to enter the sign or‘Age’ of Aquarius. For a little over 2000 years it has been passing throughPisces (160 BC to AD 2000) and before that it was in Aries (2320 BC to 160 BC).In the Pyramid Age the vernal point slowly swept through Taurus (4480 BC to 2320BC). Going further back we reach the ‘Ages’ of Gemini (6640 BC to 4480 BC) andthen Cancer (8800 BC to 6640 BC). After six ‘Great Months’ we reach the Age ofLeo (10,960 BC to 8800 BC).Now imagine that we find an ancient document at Giza which states that it wascomposed when the vernal point was in the sign of the Ram—i.e. when the sun onthe spring equinox rose against the stellar background of the constellation ofAries. Armed with this information all that we can do is roughly bracket thedocument’s date as being somewhere between 2320 BC and 160 BC, What we need inorder to arrive at a more precise chronology is some means to ‘fine-tune’ thevernal point. It is here that the specific utility of the sliding scale at themeridian becomes apparent because if the ancient document not only stated whichzodiacal sign housed the vernal point but also advised that the lowest star ofOrion’s belt crossed the meridian at an altitude of 50 degrees above the horizonthen we would be able, using precession, to calculate with great accuracy thatthe date in question must be very near 1400 BC.[644][index_split_036.html#filepos891770]The Pyramid Age occurred when the vernal point was in Taurus and, as we haveseen, the fine-tuning permitted by the 45-degree angle of the Great Pyramid’s‘Orion shaft’ draws particular attention to the date of 2500 BC. With this date,4500 years before the present, we can use precession to calculate the exactposition of the vernal point—which, as the reader will recall, was near the headof the Hyades-Taurus at that time, close to the right (i.e. west) bank of theMilky Way.The reader will also not have forgotten that this is the ‘address’ given in thePyramid Texts as the starting point for the cosmic journey of the solarHorus-King. It is here that he receives his instructions to board the solar-barkand ‘sail’ across the Milky Way towards the ‘horizon’ to meet up with Horakhti.His direction of travel is, therefore, eastwards, i.e. to the left of the vernalpoint. In terms of the chronology of the ‘Great Year’ of precession (as distinctfrom the solar year), this means that the Horus-King is now poised to travelback in time towards the age of Leo-Horakhti and to a specific spot on theecliptic path—‘The Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’ ... ‘the place morenoble than any place’.[645] [index_split_036.html#filepos891864]But where is that place? How is the Horus-King (initiate, seeker) to find it inthe 2160-year, 30-degree swathe that the constellation of Leo occupies on theecliptic?The answer is that he would have to use the gauge of Orion’s belt at themeridian to fine-tune the exact place of the vernal point and hence also toarrive at an exact date. In his mind’s eye he would have to slide the belt‘down’ the meridian to its ‘First Time’ and then see how far to the east thatoperation had ‘pushed’ the vernal point along the ecliptic.Wherever that place was would be the celestial destination that the ‘Followersof Horus’ were urging him to reach.And it would, of course, have its counterpart on the ground at Giza, in thevicinity of the lion-bodied Sphinx."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17> > The Place of the ‘First Time’‘Know that we would be universal scientists if it were given to us to inhabitthe sacred land of Egypt ...’Manetho, Egyptian high priest, third century BC‘I have come to this place more noble than any place ...’Pyramid TextsThe epoch of the ‘First Time’, Zep Tepi, was frequently referred to as the‘First Time of Horus’, the ‘First Time of Re’ and the ‘First Time ofOsiris’.[646] [index_split_036.html#filepos891994] The implication of thisterminology is that the position of the (vernal) sun along the ecliptic path,which denoted the ‘First Time’, was also seen to be marked—perhaps ‘controlled’would be a better word—by the position of Osiris-Orion at the meridian.As we have seen, the ancient brotherhood of astronomer-priests who designed theGreat Pyramid, and who were later responsible for the compilation of the PyramidTexts, were well aware of Orion’s slow precessional drift ‘upwards’—‘northwards’in the allegorical language of the texts—when the constellation was sighted atthe meridian over long periods of time. They also knew that they were ‘fixing’ aspecific location to which the ‘body of the god’ had drifted (and a specificdate in time—2500 BC in our calendar) when they targeted the meridian at 45degrees with the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber. They knew, in otherwords, that the belt stars would rise to higher altitudes above the horizon(i.e. drift further ‘north’) in future epochs and, conversely, that they hadbeen at lower altitudes (i.e. ‘further south’) in previous epochs. The readerwill recall from Chapter 1 that the lowest (‘southernmost’) point in the entireprecessional cycle of Orion’s belt—the ‘First Time of Osiris’ in allegoricalterms—occurred in 10,500 BC. Most mysteriously, it is the precise disposition ofthese stars in the sky at that date that is frozen on the ground in the form ofthe three great Pyramids of Giza.It was the mystery of this perfect meridian-to-meridian match, together with theequinoctial alignment of the lion-bodied Sphinx (and the vast antiquity of thatmonument as indicated by geology) that provoked us to undertake the presentinvestigation. For while we did not dispute the orthodox Egyptological dating ofthe Pyramids to the epoch of 2500 BC, we had a strong intuition that theirlayout in the image of Orion’s belt some 8000 years earlier was most unlikely tohave come about by chance.We are now satisfied that chance was not involved. After factoring-in the datapreserved in the vast storehouses of ancient Egyptian funerary ‘software’, itseems to us obvious that what was created—or rather completed—at Giza in 2500 BCwas an entirely deliberate work of sky-ground dualism. It was a model (on alavish scale intended to do justice to its cosmic original) of the ‘kingdom’established by Osiris in the sky-Duat in the remote epoch ‘when his name becameOrion’—i.e. in his ‘First Time’. It was also, for all time, the ‘Kingdom ofOsiris’ on the ground—‘when his name became Sokar’ (in the lower Duat, i.e. theMemphite necropolis).It may have been the case that the ground-plan of the three great Pyramids wasphysically established in 10,500 BC—perhaps in the form of low platforms. Or itmay have been that precise astronomical records from that epoch were preservedand handed down to the astronomer-priests of Heliopolis by the ‘Followers ofHorus’. Either way, we are still reasonably certain that the Pyramids themselveswere largely built in 2500 BC when Egyptologists say they were. We are alsosure, however, that the site was already vastly ancient by then and had been thedomain of the ‘Followers’—the Sages, the ‘Senior Ones’—for the previous 8000years.We think the evidence suggests a continuous transmission of advanced scientificand engineering knowledge over that huge gulf of time, and thus the continuouspresence in Egypt, from the Palaeolithic into the Dynastic Period, of highlyenlightened and sophisticated individuals—those shadowy Akhus said in the textsto have possessed ‘a knowledge of divine origin’.Fine-tuning LeoThe basis for this conjecture, above and beyond the astronomical alignments ofthe Giza necropolis, is the geological condition of the Sphinx which we havedescribed in Part I. To state matters briefly: the signs of intenseprecipitation-induced weathering visible to this day on the great monumentitself, and on the rock-hewn trench surrounding it, are consistent with an ageof more than 12,000 years.The genesis date indicated by astronomy for the site as a whole is 10,500 BC.That is what the layout of the Pyramids says, even if they themselves areyounger. And that, too, as we saw in Chapter 3, is what is proclaimed by thedue-east orientation of the Sphinx. Its astronomical and leonine symbolism doesnot make any sense unless it was built as an equinoctial marker for the Age ofLeo.But when, exactly, in the Age of Leo? The constellation spans 30 degrees alongthe ecliptic and housed the sun on the vernal equinox from 10,960 BC to 8800BC—a period of 2160 years. So when in that period?There is no way to answer this question on the basis of the alignments of theSphinx alone, or on the basis of what one may deduce from its alignments and itsgeology viewed together. What is needed is precisely what the ‘Followers ofHorus’ provided us with—a thought-tool with which to fine-tune the date. Thatthought-tool is the sliding scale of Orion’s belt and the date that itfine-tunes for the Great Sphinx is 10,500 BC.But it also does something else. As the scale ‘slides’ down the meridian it also‘pushes’ the vernal point steadily eastwards along the ecliptic, bringing it torest in 10,500 BC (the ‘bottom of the scale’) at a specific stellar address thatcan be identified by precessional calculations.In terms of the sky-ground dualism of the initiatory quest of the Horus-King, itis obvious that the vernal point’s ‘stellar address’ in 10,500 BC—i.e. itsprecise whereabouts on the ecliptic within the constellation of Leo—is likely tohave a terrestrial analogue. Once we know what’s what with the sky, in otherwords, we should know where to look on the ground.And would it be entirely unreasonable to suppose that what we would find there,if we had calculated exactly where to look, might turn out to be a physicalentrance into that mythical ‘place more noble than any place’, the ‘SplendidPlace of the “First Time” ’?Setting starsAs though to reward such conjectures, like a one-armed bandit coughing up thejackpot, all the bells and lights of the Giza necropolis start ringing andflashing at once when the sliding scale of Orion’s belt is pushed down to its‘First Time’ in 10,500 BC.We already know from Chapter 3 that what the principal monuments seem to modelis an unusual astronomical conjunction that occurred at the spring equinox inthat distant epoch. Not only did the Great Sphinx gaze at his own celestialcounterpart in the sky but also the moment of sunrise (at the point on thehorizon targeted by the Sphinx’s gaze) coincided, to the second, with themeridian-transit of Orion’s belt (which is what the three Pyramids model).If these were the only correspondences they would already be too detailed to beattributed to coincidence. But there is a great deal more. For example,immediately south of the third and smallest of the three great Pyramids is agroup of three ‘satellite’ pyramids. Egyptologists generally refer to them asthe ‘tombs’ of queens of the Pharaoh Menkaure. Since they contain noinscriptions, nor the slightest trace of human remains or funerary equipment,such an attribution can never be anything more than a matter of opinion. Howeverthese ‘satellite’ pyramids do have an unambiguous astronomical alignment: theyform a row running east-west—the equinox sunrise-sunset direction.The British geometrician and pyramid researcher, Robin Cook, has recently shownthat these three satellite pyramids bear a designed relationship to the Gizanecropolis as a whole.[647] [index_split_036.html#filepos892153] They appear tobe located on the boundary of a circle, or artificial ‘horizon’, the focus ofwhich is the Pyramid of Khafre and the circumference of which envelops the wholenecropolis. An angle of 27 degrees west of south[648][index_split_036.html#filepos892291]—corresponding to an azimuth of 207degrees[649] [index_split_036.html#filepos892395]—seems to be defined by astraight line extending from the meridian axis of the Pyramid of Khafre to thesethree ‘satellite’ pyramids of Menkaure.[650][index_split_036.html#filepos892499] In general the satellites give theimpression of being ‘reduced models’ of the three Great Pyramids. What isnotably different however, is that the latter lie at an angle of 45 degrees tothe meridian, while the former run from east to west at right-angles to themeridian. This apparent architectural anomaly, together with their curiouslocation at azimuth 207 degrees on the artificial ‘horizon’ of Giza, begs anobvious question: are we again looking at datable sky event frozen inarchitecture?[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image059.jpg]59. Epoch of 10,500 BC: setting of the three stars of Orion’s belt in line withthe three satellite Pyramids on the southern rim of the Horizon of Giza.The computer confirms that we are. In 10,500 BC, on the real horizon of Giza,the lowest of the three stars of Orion’s belt, Al Nitak, set at 27 degrees westof south—i.e. at azimuth 207 degrees. Moreover, the belt stars at that momentwould have formed an axis running east-west—the alignment that is mimicked bythe three satellite pyramids.SiriusAnother bit of the 10,500 BC ‘jackpot of correspondences’ concerns the starSirius, which symbolizes the very heart of the ancient Egyptian mystery.All stars, including our own sun (and our solar system with it) move throughspace. Because of the vast distances involved, however (hundreds and oftenthousands of light-years), this ‘proper motion’ registers barely perceptibleeffects on the positions in the sky of the majority of stars as viewed fromearth. Where these stars are concerned the only significant factor is precession(which, as we know, is a perceived ‘motion’ that is actually caused by a wobbleon the axis of the earth).Sirius is one of the major exceptions to this rule. As many readers will beaware, it is the brightest star in the sky. It is also one of the nearest starsto earth, being only 8.4 light-years away. Because of this proximity itregisters a very large ‘proper motion’ in space relative to our own solarsystem—large enough to bring about observable changes in its celestial address,over and above those caused by precession, within just a few thousand years.To be specific about this, the proper motion of Sirius is estimated to be in therange of 1.21 arc-seconds per year (about 1 degree every 3000 years). This meansthat for an epoch as far back as 10,500 BC, the change in its celestialco-ordinates resulting from proper motion could exceed 3 full degrees of arc,i.e. about six times the apparent diameter of the moon.[651][index_split_036.html#filepos892627]Once this rapid and noticeable rate of movement is taken into account alongsidethe effects of precession, computer simulations indicate a rather intriguingstate of affairs. Calculations show that when Sirius reached its ‘FirstTime’—i.e. its lowest altitude above the horizon—viewers at the latitude of Giza(30 degrees north) would have seen it resting exactly on the horizon. Moreoverit was from this latitude, and this latitude only, that such a conjunction ofstar and horizon could be witnessed. The implication is that a specialco-relationship exists between the latitude of Giza and the star Sirius at its‘First Time’.[652] [index_split_036.html#filepos892911][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image060.jpg]60. Artist’s impression of the ‘First Time’ of Sirius, in the epoch of 10,500BC, when the bright star of Isis would have been seen to be resting exactly onthe horizon.Because of its large proper motion there is uncertainty over when exactly the‘First Time’ of Sirius would have occurred. There is no doubt, however, that itwould have been somewhere between 11,500 and 10,500 BC.[653][index_split_036.html#filepos893538] We wonder, therefore, whether the decisionto establish the sacred site of Giza at 30 degrees north latitude could havebeen connected to this ‘First Time’ of Sirius? And we recall that in 1993 RudolfGantenbrink’s robot camera discovered a mysterious ‘door’ inside the GreatPyramid, more than 200 feet along the narrow southern shaft of the Queen’sChamber.[654] [index_split_036.html#filepos893624] The shaft in which the ‘door’was found was, of course, targeted on the meridian-transit of Sirius in 2500 BC.Cross-quarter causewaysAmongst the strangest and most unaccountable features of the Giza necropolis arethe massive causeways that link each of the three great Pyramids with the NileValley below. Today only fragments of their floorings remain, but as late as thefifth century BC at least one causeway, that of the Great Pyramid, was stillalmost intact. We know this because it was seen and described by the Greekhistorian Herodotus (484-420 BC)—who reflected that its construction almostmatched, in engineering prowess and architectural splendour, that of the GreatPyramid itself.[655] [index_split_036.html#filepos893754]Recent archaeological research has confirmed that the information provided byHerodotus is correct. Moreover, we now know that the roofs of the causeways werespangled on their undersides with patterns of stars[656][index_split_036.html#filepos893980]—highly appropriate symbolism if, as webelieve is the case, these grand and curious corridors were designed to serve asViae Sacrae—ceremonial ‘roadways’ which initiates would follow on their way tothe ‘Pyramid-stars’ of Rostau-Giza.[657] [index_split_036.html#filepos894177]The causeway from the Third Pyramid (the Pyramid of Menkaure) is directeddue-east,[658] [index_split_036.html#filepos894682] like the gaze of the Sphinx,and thus conforms to the general north-south and east-west grid structure of theGiza necropolis. By contrast the two causeways linked to the other two Pyramidsdefinitely do not conform to that grid structure. As a result of the work ofgeometrician John Legon, who has undertaken a detailed analysis of thesite-plans and grids provided by modern Egyptologists (such as Selim Hassan,Reisner, Holscher, Ricke and Lauer), we now know that this anomalousnonconformity nevertheless incorporates its own strict symmetry: ‘while thecauseway of the Third Pyramid is aligned due east-west, the causeways of theSecond and Great Pyramids both have a bearing of 14 degrees—the former to thesouth and the latter to the north of due east.’[659][index_split_036.html#filepos894865][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image061.jpg]61. The course of the sun throughout the year as viewed from the latitude ofGiza. A full range of 56 degrees is defined between summer solstice at 28degrees north of east and winter solstice at 28 degrees south of east (with theequinox, of course, at due east). The ‘cross-quarter’ sunrises therefore occurat 14 degrees north of east and 14 degrees south of east respectively, thusdividing the sun’s range along the horizon into four equal parts.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image062.jpg]62.

The Khafre causeway runs 14 degrees south of east in perfect alignment withthe cross-quarter sunrise that falls between the winter solstice and the springequinox (and thus also, on the sun’s ‘return journey’, between the autumnequinox and the winter solstice).Legon has also provided conclusive evidence that the design of the Khufu andKhafre causeways is in fact integrated with the geometry of the Giza complex asa whole—and not merely with that of the individual Pyramids themselves.Furthermore, far from being conditioned by the topography of the site (as hadpreviously been supposed) the direction of these causeways (14 degrees north andsouth of east respectively) shows every sign of being part of a ‘unified plan’whose ‘hidden purpose’ and impetus ‘possibly resided with the priests ofHeliopolis’.[660] [index_split_036.html#filepos896162]But what ‘hidden purpose’ could dictate the decision to direct one causeway dueeast, another 14 degrees south of due east, and a third 14 degrees north of dueeast?When sunrise is observed conscientiously throughout the course of the year fromthe latitude of Giza, the answer to this question becomes obvious. Here, aseverywhere else on the planet, the sun rises due east—in line with the Menkaurecauseway (and the gaze of the Sphinx)—on the spring equinox. What is uniqueabout the latitude of Giza, as we have noted several times previously, is thaton the summer solstice (the longest day of the year) the sun rises 28 degrees tothe north of due east whilst on the winter solstice (the shortest day) it rises28 degrees to the south of due east. This gives a full variation of 56 degreesand it is a simple matter of fact that what astronomers refer to as the‘cross-quarters’ of this variation, i.e. the sunrise-points located exactly halfway between each equinox and solstice, are at 14 degrees north of due east and14 degrees south of due east respectively. In short the three causeways signaland bracket the equinox with two gigantic ‘arrows’ pointed at the cross-quartersunrises and a third arrow (the Menkaure causeway) pointed at the equinoxsunrise itself. In this fashion the sun’s range throughout the year along theeastern horizon is architecturally divided into four equal segments each with arange of 14 degrees—i.e. into its astronomical ‘cross-quarters’.Now a focus on the cross-quarter days, together with the equinoxes andsolstices, is an extremely well-documented phenomenon amongst many ancientastronomically minded peoples (dictating the alignment of their temples and thedates of their most important festivals).[661][index_split_036.html#filepos896300] It is therefore not surprising to find sucha focus expressed in the architecture of the Giza necropolis. Neither should webe surprised by the accuracy with which the causeways define the cross-quarterssince all the other alignments of the necropolis were achieved with equally highprecision.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image065.jpg]65.

The Great Sphinx in the ‘ground-horizon’ of Giza, with only its massivehead, back and shoulders protruding into view above ground level. Once again theimages in the sky and on the ground ‘lock’ at 10,500 BC.There is one feature of the layout, however, that is truly exceptional andremarkable.Computer reconstructions of the ancient skies reveal that if we could travelback in time to the cross-quarter day that fell between the winter solstice andthe vernal equinox in 10,500 BC, and position ourselves at the ‘top’, i.e. thewestern end, of the Khafre causeway gazing along it towards the edge of the‘Horizon’ of Giza, then we would witness the following celestial events at dawn:1. The sun would rise at 14 degrees south of east in direct alignmentwith the causeway;[662] [index_split_036.html#filepos896503]2. Immediately to the left of this point would be the great constellationof Leo-Horakhti, with only its massive head and shoulders protruding above thehorizon line (it would, in other words, appear to be partially sunk, or ‘buried’in the ‘Horizon of the Sky’).Now let us look down from the sky to the ground. Following the southeasterlydirection of the causeway from the same viewpoint we note that it sinks downwith the general slope of the Giza plateau and passes just to the south of thesouthern edge of the Sphinx enclosure. The Sphinx itself—Hor-em-Akhet—standspartially sunk, or ‘buried’ in that enclosure (and thus in the ‘Horizon ofGiza’) with only its massive head and shoulders protruding out of thegroundline.Once again the images of sky and ground match perfectly at 10,500 BC and in noother epoch ...Treasure mapWe said earlier that in the architectural-astronomical system of the Pyramidbuilders the position of the vernal point along the ecliptic which denoted the‘Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’ was considered to be ‘controlled’ by theposition of Osiris-Orion at the meridian: ‘slide’ Orion’s belt up from itslocation at 2500 BC and the vernal point is ‘pushed’ westwards around theecliptic (and forward in time) in the direction Taurusà Ariesà Piscesà Aquarius;‘slide’ it down and the vernal point is pushed ‘east’, i.e. back in time, in thedirection Taurusà Geminià Cancerà Leo. So in 10,500 BC, with the belt starsfully ‘slid down’ to their lowest possible altitude above the horizon, how fararound the ecliptic has the vernal point been ‘pushed? We know it is in Leo. Butwhere in Leo?Computer simulations show that it lay exactly 111.111 degrees east of thestation that it had occupied at 2500 BC. Then it had been at the head of theHyades-Taurus close to the right bank of the Milky Way; 8000 years earlier itlay directly under the rear paws of the constellation of Leo.As we have hinted, this is a location that is likely to have a terrestrial‘double’. The three stars of Orion’s belt have their terrestrial doubles in theform of the three Great Pyramids. The constellation of Leo-Horakhti has itsterrestrial double in the form of Hor-em-Akhet, i.e. the Great Sphinx. The‘Horizon of the Sky’ has its terrestrial double in the form of the ‘Horizon ofGiza’. And the Great Sphinx crouches literally within this ‘Horizon’.It was to the breast of the Great Sphinx, at the summer solstice in the PyramidAge, that the quest of the Horus-King led. There he encountered the Akhus:‘How has this happened to you’, say they, the Akhus with their mouths equipped,‘that you have come to this place more noble than any place?’‘I have come ... because the reed floats of the sky were set down for Re [thesun-disc and cosmic ‘double’ of the Horus-King] that Re might cross [the MilkyWay] on them to Horakhti at the Horizon’ ...[663][index_split_036.html#filepos897261]In other words, the Horus-King has successfully understood and used the cluesprovided in the ritual. He has noted and followed the path of the sun during thesolar year from its starting point—designated in the texts as being beside theHyades-Taurus, i.e. the ‘Bull of the Sky’—and thence across the Milky Way untilthe moment of its conjunction with Regulus, the heart-star of Leo. He has thentaken this celestial treasure map, transposed its co-ordinates to the ground,made his way across the River Nile and ascended to the Giza plateau, comingeventually to the breast of the Sphinx.We think that he received there the necessary clues or instructions to find theentrance to the terrestrial Duat, to the ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ on the ground—inshort to the ‘Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’ where he would have to go inorder to complete his quest. And we suggest that these clues were designed toencourage him to track the vernal point, just as we have done, to the locationthat it would have occupied in 10,500 BC when Orion’s belt had reached thelowest point in its precessional cycle.In other words it is our hypothesis that the Giza monuments, the past, presentand future skies that lie above them, and the ancient funerary texts thatinterlink them, convey the lineaments of a message. In attempting to read thismessage we have done no more than follow the initiation ‘journey’ of theHorus-Kings of Egypt. And like the ancient Horus-Kings we, too, have arrived ata most intriguing crossroad. The trail of initiation has guided us, directed usand finally lured us to stand in front of the Great Sphinx and, like Oedipus, toconfront the ultimate riddles: ‘Where did we come from?’ ‘Where are we to goto?’The gaze of the Sphinx urges us to see through the shadowy veil and seek the‘First Time’. But, having done that, it also provokes us to ask whether theremight not in fact be something at Giza, something physical, that would give formto the site’s strange aura of vast and exceptional antiquity.We remember a passage from the Coffin Texts which invites us to consider thepossibility that some great ‘secret’ of Osiris may remain hidden within orbeneath the monuments of Rostau-Giza in a ‘sealed’ container: ‘This is thesealed thing, which is in darkness, with fire about it, which contains theefflux of Osiris, and it is put in Rostau. It has been hidden since it fell fromhim, and it is what came down from him onto the desert of sand; it means thatwhat belonged to him was put in Rostau ...’[664][index_split_036.html#filepos897402]What can it be that was put in Rostau?What hidden thing with fire about it?And where in darkness does it lie?If we look at our computer simulation of the skies over Giza in 10,500 BC theanswer appears to be staring us in the face. In that year, in the predawn on thespring equinox, the constellation of Leo could be seen rising slowly in theeast. By around 5 a.m. it was fully risen, exactly straddling due east—a lion inthe sky, with its belly resting on the horizon. At the same moment, thesun—marking the vernal point—lay some 12 degrees beneath its rear paws.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image068.jpg]68. The Horus-King’s treasure map: the heliacal rising of Leo on the springequinox in 10,500 BC. The sun, marking the vernal point, lies below the horizon,some 12 degrees beneath the constellation’s rear paws. When this image istransposed to the ground, the logic of the Horus-King’s quest suggests thepossibility of a hidden chamber deep in the bedrock of the Giza plateau,approximately too feet beneath the rear paws of the Sphinx.When we translate this sky-image onto the ground, in the form of a colossal,leonine, equinoctial monument with its belly resting on the bedrock of the realphysical environment of the ‘Horizon of Giza’, we do indeed find ourselveslooking at the Horus-King’s treasure map. It is a map, not buried in the earthbut cunningly concealed in time, where ‘X’ almost literally ‘marks a spot’directly under the rear paws of the Great Sphinx of Egypt at a depth, we wouldguess, of about 100 feet.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image069.jpg]69. Possible locations of an underground system of passageways and chambersbeneath the Great Sphinx suggested by astronomical correlations and byseismographic tests (see Part I of the present work).If we have read the message of the ‘Followers of Horus’ right, then there issomething of momentous importance there, waiting to be found—by seismic surveys,by drilling and excavations, in short by a rediscovery and exploration of thehidden corridors and chambers of the earthly ‘Kingdom of Osiris’.It could be the ultimate prize."},{"pageContent":"Conclusion> > Return to the Beginning‘I stand before the masters who witnessed the genesis, who were the authors oftheir own forms, who walked the dark, circuitous passages of their own becoming...

And they are Isis and Osiris, the divineintelligences. And when the story is written and the end is good and the soul ofa man is perfected, with a shout they lift him into heaven ...’Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead (Normandi Ellis translation)The dictionary tells us that, separately from its modern usage, the word‘glamour’ has a traditional meaning roughly equivalent to ‘magic spell’ or‘charm’, and is the Old Scottish variant of: ‘grammar ... hence a magic spell,because occult practices were popularly associated with learning.’Is it possible that men and women of great wisdom and learning cast a ‘glamour’over the Giza necropolis at some point in the distant past? Were they thepossessors of as yet unguessed-at secrets that they wished to hide here? And didthey succeed in concealing those secrets almost in plain view? For thousands ofyears, in other words, has the ancient Egyptian royal cemetery at Giza veiledthe presence of something else—something of vastly greater significance for thestory of Mankind?One thing we are sure of is that unlike the hundreds of Fourth-Dynasty mastabatombs to the west of the Sphinx and clustered around the three great Pyramids,the Pyramids themselves were never designed to serve primarily as burial places.We do not rule out the possibility that the Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Menkauremay at one time have been buried within them—although there is no evidence forthis—but we are now satisfied that the transcendent effort and skill that wentinto the construction of these awe-inspiring monuments was motivated by a higherpurpose.We think that purpose was connected to the quest for eternal life wrapped up ina complete religious and spiritual system that the ancient Egyptians inheritedfrom unknown predecessors and that they later codified in their eerie andother-worldly funerary and rebirth texts. We suggest, in short, that it was thegoal of immortality, not just for one Pharaoh but for many, that the corridorsand passages and hidden chambers and concealed gates and doorways of the Gizacomplex were ultimately designed to serve. Depicted in the Book of What is inthe Duat as being filled with monsters, these narrow, claustrophobic, terrifyingplaces, hemmed in on all sides by sheer stone walls, were in our view conceivedas the ultimate testing ground for initiates. Here they would be forced to faceand overcome their most horrible and debilitating fears. Here they would passthrough unimaginable ordeals of the spirit and the mind. Here they would learnesoteric wisdom through acts of concentrated intelligence and will. Here theywould be prepared, through practice and experience, for the moment of physicaldeath and for the nightmares that would follow it, so that these transitionswould not confuse or paralyse them—as they might other, unprepared, souls—and sothat they might become ‘equipped spirits’ able to move as they wished throughheaven and earth, ‘unfailingly, and regularly and eternally’.[665][index_split_036.html#filepos897543]Such was the lofty goal of the Horus-King’s quest and the ancient Egyptiansclearly believed that in order to attain it the initiate would have toparticipate in the discovery, the unveiling, the revelation, of something ofmomentous importance—something that would bestow wisdom, and knowledge of the‘First Time’, and of the mysteries of the cosmos, and of Osiris, the Once andFuture King.We are therefore reminded of a Hermetic Text, written in Greek but compiled inAlexandria in Egypt some 2000 years ago, that is known as the Kore Kosmu (orVirgin of the World).[666] [index_split_036.html#filepos897801] Like other suchwritings, this text speaks of Thoth, the ancient Egyptian wisdom-god, but refersto him by his Greek name, Hermes:Such was all-knowing Hermes, who saw all things, and seeing understood, andunderstanding had the power both to disclose and to give explanation. For whathe knew, he graved on stone; yet though he graved them onto stone he hid themmostly ... The sacred symbols of the cosmic elements [he] hid away hard by thesecrets of Osiris ... keeping sure silence, that every younger age of cosmictime might seek for them.[667] [index_split_036.html#filepos898144]The text then tells us that before he ‘returned to Heaven’ Hermes invoked aspell on the secret writings and knowledge that he had hidden:O holy books, who have been made by my immortal hands, by incorruption’s magicspells ... free from decay throughout eternity remain, and incorrupt from time.Become unseeable, unfindable, for every one whose foot shall tread the plains ofthis land, until Old Heaven doth bring forth meet instruments for you ...[668][index_split_036.html#filepos898287]What instruments might lead to the recovery of ‘unseeable and unfindable’secrets concealed at Giza?Our research has persuaded us that a scientific language of precessional timeand allegorical astronomy was deliberately expressed in the principal monumentsthere and in the texts that relate to them. From quite an early stage in ourinvestigation, we hoped that this language might shed new light on the enigmaticcivilization of Egypt. We did not at first suspect, however, that it would alsoturn out to encode specific celestial coordinates or that these would transposeonto the ground in the form of an arcane ‘treasure map’, directing the attentionof seekers to a precise location in the bedrock deep beneath the Sphinx.Nor did we suspect, until we met them, that others such as the Edgar CayceFoundation and the Stanford Research Institute—see Part II—might already belooking there.Osiris breathesThroughout this investigation we have tried to stick to the facts, even when thefacts have been very strange.When we say that the Sphinx, the three Great Pyramids, the causeways and otherassociated monuments of the Giza necropolis form a huge astronomical diagram weare simply reporting a fact. When we say that this diagram depicts the skiesabove Giza in 10,500 BC we are reporting a fact. When we say that the Sphinxbears erosion marks which indicate that it was carved before the Sahara became adesert we are reporting a fact. When we say that the ancient Egyptiansattributed their civilization to ‘the gods’ and to the ‘Followers of Horus’ weare reporting facts. When we say that these divine and human civilizers wereremembered as having come to the Nile Valley in Zep Tepi—the ‘First Time’—we arereporting a fact. When we say that the ancient Egyptian records tell us this‘First Time’ was an epoch in the remote past, thousands of years before the eraof the Pharaohs, we are reporting a fact.Our civilization has had the scientific wherewithal to get to grips with themany problems of the Giza necropolis for less than two centuries, and it is onlyin the last two decades that computer technology has made it possible for us toreconstruct the ancient skies and see the patterns and conjunctions thatunfolded there. During this period access to the site, and knowledge about it,has been monopolized by members of the archaeological and Egyptologicalprofessions who have agreed amongst themselves as to the origin, and age, andfunction of the monuments. New evidence which does not support this scholarlyconsensus, and which might actively undermine it, has again and again beenoverlooked, or sidelined, and sometimes even deliberately concealed from thepublic. This, we assume, is why everything to do with the shafts of the GreatPyramid—their stellar alignments, the iron plate, the relics, and the discoveryof the ‘door’—has met with such peculiar and inappropriate responses fromEgyptologists and archaeologists. And we assume that it explains, too, why thesame scholars have paid such scant attention to the solid case that geologistshave made for the vast antiquity of the Sphinx.[669][index_split_036.html#filepos898381]The Giza monuments are a legacy for Mankind, preserved almost intact overthousands of years, and, outside the privileged circles of Egyptology andarchaeology, there is today a broad-based expectation that they might be aboutto reveal a remarkable secret. That expectation may or may not prove to becorrect. Nevertheless in an intellectual culture polarized by publicanticipation and orthodox reaction, we feel it is only wise that futureexplorations at the necropolis should be conducted with complete ‘transparency’and accountability. In particular the opening of the ‘door’ inside the southernshaft of the Queen’s Chamber, the videoscopic examination of the northern shaft,and any further remote-sensing and drilling surveys conducted around the Sphinx,should be carried out under the scrutiny of the international mass media andshould not again be subjected to bizarre and inexplicable delays.We cannot predict what new discoveries will be made by such research, or evenwhether any new discoveries will be made. However, after completing our ownarchaeoastronomical investigation, and following the quest of the Horus-King, weare left with an enhanced sense of the tremendous mystery of this amazing site—asense that its true story has only just begun to be told. Looking at theawe-inspiring scale and precision of the monuments we feel, too, that thepurpose of the ancient master-builders was sublime, and that they did indeedfind a way to initiate those who would come after—thousands of years in thefuture—by making use of the universal language of the stars.They found a way to send a message across the ages in a code so simple and soself-explanatory that it might rightly be described as an anti-cipher.Perhaps the time has come to listen to that clear, compelling signal thatbeckons to us out of the darkness of prehistory. Perhaps the time has come toseek the buried treasure of our forgotten genesis and destiny:Stars fade like memory the instant before dawn. Low in the east the sun appears,golden as an opening eye. That which can be named must exist. That which isnamed can be written. That which is written shall be remembered. That which isremembered lives.

Sellers observes that Spell 17 of the Book of the Dead, which is drawnfrom extremely ancient sources, alludes in cosmic terms to the ‘unification’ orjoining of the ‘Two Lands’:[671] [index_split_036.html#filepos898836] ‘Horus,son of Osiris and Isis ... was made ruler in the place of his father, Osiris, onthat day the Two Lands were united. It means the union of the Two Lands at theburial of Osiris ...’[672] [index_split_036.html#filepos898994]Following this statement, Spell 17 also makes specific reference to the‘sun-god’ and how he was not obstructed by the celestial river but rather‘passed on, having bathed in the Winding Waterway’.[673][index_split_036.html#filepos899136]Sellers notes the conclusion of Yale astronomer-Egyptologist Virginia Lee Davisthat the ‘Winding Waterway’ of the Pyramid Texts is to be equated with the MilkyWay and that this feature of the sky ‘divides’ the cosmic landscape into twohalves.[674] [index_split_036.html#filepos899222] She then adds: ‘I havecontended that the joining of the two lands is a joining of sky to earth.’[675][index_split_036.html#filepos899360]In fact, both Sellers and Davis arrive at the same conclusion, namely that the‘divider’ of the celestial landscape is the Milky Way, and that which crosses itfrom one side to the other is the sun. Sellers also observes that the point of‘crossing’ of the ecliptic path is near the V-shaped Hyades-Taurusconstellation.[676] [index_split_036.html#filepos899455]If we seek to be precise about these matters we will discover that the point ofcrossing is in fact a little further east along the ecliptic path, marking aspot on the western shore of the Milky Way where today is found the M1 nebula,also known as the Crab Nebula.[677] [index_split_036.html#filepos899549]Sellers, oddly, does not pursue the logical sequence of events in Spell 17,namely that the sun continues along its journey, reaches the ‘other side’ (i.e.the eastern side) of the Milky Way, and thence heads towards the constellationof Leo. Indeed, Spell 17 bids the solar ‘Horus’, i.e. the sun-disc, to ‘run, runto this’ location: ‘How well built is your House, O Atum, how well founded isyour mansion, O Double Lion ...’Atum or Atum-Re, as was shown in The Orion Mystery, was originally venerated asa ‘pillar’ in Heliopolis which, as many researchers have concluded, was alsoseen as his ‘phallus’.[678] [index_split_036.html#filepos900209] A somewhatsimilar ‘pillar’, the so-called Djed pillar, was also associated withOsiris.[679] [index_split_036.html#filepos900503] Bearing this in mind, Spell 17makes a most telling statement: ‘As for the Lion whose mouth is bright and whosehead is shining, he is the Phallus of Osiris. Otherwise said, he is the Phallusof Re ...’[680] [index_split_036.html#filepos900662]Earlier in Spell 17 we are specifically informed that Atum is:... in his sun-disc. Otherwise said he is Re when he rises in the easternhorizon of the sky.To me belongs yesterday, I know tomorrow.What does it mean? As for yesterday, that is Osiris. As for tomorrow, that is Rein which the foes of the Lord Of All were destroyed and Horus was made to rule.Otherwise said: That is the day of the ‘We remain’ festival, when the burial ofOsiris was ordered by his father Re.The Battle-Ground of the gods was made in accordance with my command.What does it mean? It is the West. It was made for the souls of the gods inaccordance with the command of Osiris, Lord of the Western Desert. Otherwisesaid: It means that this is the West, to which Re made every god descend and hefought for the Two [Lands] for it.I know that Great God who is in it.Who is he? It is Osiris ...[681] [index_split_036.html#filepos900807]From this text we can see that a special ‘land of the gods’ was envisaged ashaving been established in the Western Desert at the time of the burial ofOsiris—that is in the far-off epoch of the First Time. This was also the day onwhich Horus united the Two Lands and inherited this ‘battle ground’ or ‘land ofthe gods’.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image070.jpg]70. The Djed pillar of Osiris, flanked by Isis and Nepthys. Above it is thesymbol of” the Horian sun-god, probably marking the meridian-transit of thesolar disc.We have seen in earlier chapters how the Memphite Theology in the Shabaka Textsnominates the area in which these ‘unification’ events took place as Ayan nearMemphis.[682] [index_split_036.html#filepos900893] Oddly, the process of ‘theUnification of the Two Lands’ is also referred to in these same sources as ‘theBalance of the Two Lands, in which Upper and Lower Egypt have been weighed...’[683] [index_split_036.html#filepos901061]In the present work we have brought forward additional evidence in support ofSellers’s contention that the ‘Two Lands’ in question were indeed ‘sky’ and‘earth’ and we have also shown that very specific parts of the sky and earthwere meant—i.e. the ‘Orion-Leo-Taurus’ sky-region and the‘Giza-Heliopolis-Memphis’ earth-region.But how could these two sky-to-earth regions be ‘balanced’ and ‘weighed’?A state of perfect orderThe point of ‘balance’ is defined on the ground as: ‘... Ayan, that was thedivision of the Two Lands ... in the name of the “White Wall” [Memphis]...’[684] [index_split_036.html#filepos901147]We have seen how this terrestrial location corresponds to a point in the skyalong the ecliptic path marking the spot on the western shore of the Milky Waywhere the M1 Crab Nebula is located.A closer look at the Memphite Theology, however, reveals that while Ayan isenvisaged as the pivot or ‘balance point’ of the Two Lands, the actual processof ‘weighing’ is described as taking place somewhere else—specifically in ‘theland ... [of the] burial of Osiris in the House of Sokar ...’[685][index_split_036.html#filepos901352]Since we have already demonstrated that ‘the land of the House of Sokar’ wasRostau, i.e. the Giza necropolis, we can conclude—by a simple transposition ofsky-ground terminology—that the ‘weighing’ or ‘balancing’ of the land wassomehow done at Giza, and most likely beside or within the Great Pyramid, theoriginal ‘House’ of Sokar-Osiris.[686] [index_split_036.html#filepos901446]But why should the Great Pyramid have been seen as an ‘instrument’ by which the‘Two Lands’—sky and ground—could be ‘balanced’ at a specific spot, i.e. atAyan-Memphis?[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image071.jpg]71. Sun-boat on the back of the double-lion hieroglyph for Aker. [Top] is ascene of revivification, showing the solar path from east to west. Note thehawk’s head beneath the solar disk at the meridian.We must remind ourselves that the chronology and context of the ‘unification’events was set way back in the cosmic landscape of the ‘First Time’. Let us,therefore, transfer the imagery that now confronts us back to the epoch 10,500BC, and see how the supposed ‘perfect balance’ was achieved at the cosmic‘Ayan’, i.e. at the location, marked by the M1 Crab Nebula that we have alreadyidentified on the ecliptic path.The three great Pyramids of Giza, of course, become Orion’s belt at themeridian—with the Great Pyramid itself being represented by its specificcelestial counterpart, Al Nitak, the lowest of the three belt stars.The diagram reproduced on page 283 [#74] shows Orion’s belt with Al Nitak at themeridian in 10,500 BC. At this precise moment, as we saw in Chapter 17, thevernal-equinox point lay due east, just below Leo. Meanwhile the ‘opposed’autumnal equinox point lay precisely due west (just below Aquarius). In short,this was a time when the ‘Two Skies’—one on each side of the Milky Way—were inperfect balance, perfectly divided, just as the texts describe.Much suggests that the ‘Followers of Horus’ envisaged the ecliptic path of thesun arching like the huge beam of a scale across the visible sky. One end ofthis beam was marked by Leo at the vernal-equinox point, and the other byAquarius at the autumnal-equinox point. So, when Al Nitak came to rest at thecelestial meridian on the vernal equinox in 10,500 BC the sky could rightly besaid to have been in a state of perfect order.MaatCosmic Order, in the symbolic terminology of the ancient Egyptians, was known asMaat. The same word also means ‘justice’ and ‘law’—for example the justice thatwas exercised by the ‘council of gods’ of Heliopolis when they judged in favourof Horus, after his conflict with Seth, and passed on to him the legacy of theOsirian throne.The ancient Egyptian religious texts transmit details of one of the high ritualsof the Osirian liturgy—the ‘weighing of the soul’ of the dead in the GreatJudgement Hall of Osiris. This is a sort of archetypal ‘Judgement of Solomon’,with the weighing being done on the Great Scales of Maat.The Papyrus of Ani in the British Museum provides us with a particularly vividdepiction of the Great Judgement Hall, and also of the Great Scales of Maat.These latter have a name—Mekhaat[687] [index_split_036.html#filepos902209]—whichmeans in other contexts ‘the balance of the Earth’.[688][index_split_036.html#filepos902380][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image072.jpg]72. The Scales of Maat. (Source: British Museum papyrus 9901-3).The hieroglyphic determinative sign for the verb ‘to weigh’ shows a triangle, orbuilder’s ‘square’, with a plumb-bob suspended from the apex[689][index_split_036.html#filepos902466]—a sign which can also mean to ‘balance theearth’.[690] [index_split_036.html#filepos902584] The triangle distinctlyrecalls the profile or cross-section of a pyramid.As we have seen in Part II of this book, a curious stone sphere, a length ofwooden rod, and a bronze hook were found inside the Great Pyramid in 1872,sealed since the time of the construction of the monument in the shafts of theQueen’s Chamber. Mr. Henry Williams Chisholm, the Head of the StandardsDepartment of the Board of Trade in London, carefully examined these relics inthe year of their discovery and concluded that the sphere was most probably astandard weight and that the rod and hook might also have had functionsconnected with weighing and measuring. He published these conclusions in theprestigious journal, Nature, on 26 December 1872.Similar views were held by the Astronomer Royal of Scotland, Charles PiazziSmyth, who also examined the relics in 1872.[691][index_split_036.html#filepos902680]And a certain Mr. E. H. Pringle suggested in a letter to Nature that the stonesphere could have been a ‘mason’s plumb-bob’ and that the ‘bronze hook and thecedar rod may have formed part of the same tool’.[692][index_split_036.html#filepos902855]A ‘plumb-bob’ of some sort must have been used to align the slopes of theshafts. And we have also seen how a ‘plumb-bob’ was used in the hieroglyphicsign meaning ‘weighing’ and, by extension, ‘the balance’.Perhaps the Great Pyramid—the terrestrial counterpart of the star Al Nitak—wasseen as a weighing device or ‘instrument’ playing its part in some as yetunexplained attempt to restore the ‘balance’ or cosmic order of the world, i.e.Maat, as it was in the ‘First Time’. Let us consider this possibility.Juggling for balanceWe saw in Chapter 3 that the Great Pyramid functions as a mathematical scalemodel of the northern hemisphere of the earth on a scale of 1:43,200.[693][index_split_036.html#filepos902964] By transposition and extension, therefore,it should be obvious that the monument can also serve as an architectural andmathematical representation of the northern hemisphere of the sky.[694][index_split_036.html#filepos903199]Now if we look at a cross-section of the Great Pyramid, we notice that each ofits two sets of ‘star-shafts’—i.e. the northern and the southern in the King’sand Queen’s Chambers respectively—are theoretically intended to emerge at thesame heights on the north and south faces of the monument. They appear to hangout like gigantic arms balancing, as it were, the whole geometrical scheme ofthe Pyramid. But there is something curious about the position of the twochambers from which these shafts emanate. The Queen’s Chamber lies along thecentre-line of the Pyramid. The King’s Chamber, on the other hand, is offsetsomewhat to the south of the centre-line—almost as though the ‘counterweight’ ona huge set of scales had been slid to the left in order to achieve ‘balance’.The consequences of this curious architectural anomaly are as follows:1. Queen’s Chamber: the ‘designed’ average angle of the two shafts is 38degrees 08’, thus forming a right angle with the faces of the pyramid (51degrees 52’ + 38 degrees 08’ = 90 degrees).[695][index_split_036.html#filepos903507]2. King’s Chamber: the ‘designed’ angle of the southern shaft is 45degrees 00’ and that of the northern shaft is 32 degrees 30’. This counteractsthe effects of the offset of the chamber and restores the ‘balance’ of thegeneral geometrical design.[c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image073.jpg]73. Cross-sections of the Great Pyramid showing the ‘balancing’ of the monumentwith the star-shafts.The altitude of Al Nitak at the meridian in 2500 BC was 45 degrees—in line withthe southern shaft of the King’s Chamber. The reader will recall that the vernalpoint in this epoch was just over the Hyades-Taurus, whose terrestrialcounterpart we have identified as the region of the Dahshur Pyramids.[696][index_split_036.html#filepos904138]But let us see in what epoch Al Nitak would have crossed the meridian at 38degrees 08’ altitude—i.e. in alignment with the southern shaft of the Queen’sChamber?Precessional calculations show that such an alignment would have occurred incirca 3850 BC—a date that is extremely close to that favoured by many earlierEgyptologists for the epoch of the ‘Unification’ which was supposedly sealed atAyan-Memphis.[697] [index_split_036.html#filepos904265] It is therefore surelyof interest to note that in 3850 BC the vernal point was positioned near the M1Crab Nebula, the spot on the celestial landscape—and along the eclipticpath—that we have identified as the sky-counterpart of Ayan-Memphis.Three Wise MenIn 10,500 BC the star Al Nitak in the belt of Orion was at the lowest altitudeof its precessional cycle and Leo housed the vernal-equinox point. In our ownepoch—the epoch of AD 2000—the other extreme of the curious ‘balancingmechanism’ of Giza is about to be reached: Al Nitak today stands within a fewarc seconds of the highest altitude that it will attain in its precessionalcycle and the vernal point is about to drift into the constellation of Aquarius.Between the ‘First Time’ and the ‘Last Time’, in other words, the skies havereversed themselves—literally flipped left to right—with Aquarius now markingthe vernal equinox and Leo marking the autumnal equinox.We wonder whether it is possible that the sages of Heliopolis, working at thedawn of history, could somehow have created an archetypal ‘device’, a devicedesigned to trigger off messianic events across the ‘Ages’—the Pyramid Age whenthe vernal point was in Taurus, for example, the Christic Age in Pisces,[698][index_split_036.html#filepos904359] and perhaps even a ‘New Age’ in Aquarius?We note in this connection that in circa 330 BC, when the vernal point wasbeginning its precessional drift into the ‘Age of Pisces’, the altitude of AlNitak (viewed from the latitude of Giza) was 51 degrees 52’—the angle of slopeof the Great Pyramid. At this time the conquests of Alexander the Great (356-323BC), and the resulting merger of the Eastern and Western worlds, triggered greatexpectations of a messianic ‘Return’ in the East. First at Alexandria, thenacross the Levant, a general agitation began, as if triggered by some prophetic‘device’, which culminated in the great messianic events of Christianity.[699][index_split_036.html#filepos904645][c:/DOCUME~1/AARONJ~1.AAR/Desktop/New%20Books/HANCOCK%2c%20Graham%20%26amp%3b%20BAUVAL%2c%20Robert%20-%20The%20Message%20of%20the%20Sphinx_files/image074.jpg]74a.

His comments and corrections were takeninto account, and the draft was rewritten in the form that is publishedherewith. When Dr. Lehner was sent the revised draft he wrote us the followingletter making further comments which we agreed to reproduce in full as anAppendix. Our own reply to Dr. Lehner’s letter is also appended.From: Mark LehnerTo: Mr. Robert G. Bauval and Mr. Graham HancockNovember 16, 1995Dear Graham and Robert,Thank you for your letter of 12 November 1995 and for the second draft of yourChapter 5, ‘The Case of the Psychic, the Scholar And the Sphinx’(!). It appearsto be much more accurate than the first draft concerning the events of which Iwas a part.I have the following observations to make and corrections to suggest (again opento the public):p. 86: ‘his pronouncements ... spawned multi-million dollar industry ...embroiled ... with mainstream Egyptological research ... first learned about ...when reviewing ... Mark Lehner.’Do you mean to convey that Cayce alone (without theosophy, anthroposophy,freemasonry, astrology, sacred metrology, channeling, UFO aficionados, andShirley MacClaine) spawned a multi-million dollar industry that fed directlyinto my involvement with Egyptology? That would be a little absurd.p. 92: ‘The equipment for RSI’s work ... Immediately afterwards the project wasstopped.’This is still not quite right. The drilling equipment was tested and usedelsewhere, for example, west of the Second Pyramid, before it was brought downfor the two holes in the Sphinx Temple. The project was not stopped immediatelyafterwards. RSI/SRI drilled two more holes in the southeast corner of the floorof the Sphinx and under the south forepaw of the Sphinx. Then the project kindof fizzled to an end because of the falling out between RSI and SRI and, as Iremember, because the SRI team had been in Egypt for a couple of months or moreand had other work.p. 92: ‘did not appreciate ... led to ... falling out between RSI and SRI.’As I recall, although RSI did not appreciate particularly the Cayce involvement,the falling out between RSI and SRI was over fiduciary issues. Why don’t youcontact SRI and ask them?p. 93: ‘Adding to the intrigue ... yet another project financed by the EdgarCayce Foundation.’You do want to hang on to that intrigue! No, this was not yet another project.The down-hole immersion acoustical sounding was done in the last days of SRI’sfieldwork at the Sphinx in 1978, not 1982, not another project. I do not have,at present, a copy of this Venture Inward but if it says this is another projectin 1982, it is wrong. All that I describe in the quote you excerpted happenedthe last few days of the 1978 project.p. 93: ‘a survey, as the reader will recall, ... abrupt halt ... AntiquitiesOrganization.’You seem inclined to see ‘abrupt halts’. You should not cite me to verify thispoint because I was not at these events, but my impression is that Schoch, West,and Dobecki were not thwarted in their first season of work at the Sphinx.Permission for such work is granted or denied by a large committee of theSupreme Council for Antiquities (formerly Egyptian Antiquities Organization).p. 94: ‘Pulling Away. When, exactly, Professor Lehner began to pull away fromthe influence of the Edgar Cayce Foundation and crossed over into the mainstreamof professional Egyptology and its orthodoxy is not especially clear.’Are you suggesting, based on your own understanding of how belief systemsoperate, that there are definite lines where ‘now you believe’ and ‘now youdon’t’? You seem particularly interested in this question. The way you frame itreminds me of the US Congressional hearings on the Watergate cover-upconspiracy: ‘What did the President know, and when did he know it?’ ‘What didLehner believe, and when did he not believe it?!’Let me offer some biography to use if you so choose.I already had doubts when I went to Egypt in 1973, since Cayce’s ancient historydid not agree much with anthropology courses I took at the University of NorthDakota. But as I indicated in my last letter, I did indeed have hopes thatevidence could be found of past events bearing some agreement with Cayce’sstory.During my two years at the American University in Cairo I majored inanthropology, and took my first courses in Egyptian archaeology and prehistory.I also spent most of my free time at Giza, and I visited other ancient sites andarchaeological projects. I did not find ‘footprints of the gods’. By becomingacquainted with a vast amount of previous archaeological research with which theCayce community and like-minded Egypt-enthusiasts are only minimally familiar, Ifound the ‘footprints’ of people—their tool marks, names, family relationships,skeletons, and material culture.In 1974 I read social psychologist Leon Festinger’s work on ‘cognitivedissonance’, in particular his book, When Prophecy Fails. Festinger deals withpeople reacting to conflict between a revealed belief system and empiricallyderived information, that is, physical evidence. In his work, I recognized manyattributes of the Cayce worldview, my own belief, and my growing doubts.When I returned to Virginia Beach I would outline in lectures and conversationsthe real achaeological evidence surrounding the Sphinx and the Pyramids and itsconflict with the Cayce picture of Egypt. I spoke to my good friends andsupporters, like Hugh Lynn and Joseph Jahoda (are your two unnamed ARE mensupposed to remain as mysterious as ‘The Scholar’?), about my doubts, and howthe Cayce community and belief system fits many aspects discussed by Festingerand other social scientists.In these talks I began to suggest to the Cayce community that they look at theEgypt/Atlantis story as a myth in the sense that Joseph Campbell popularized, orthat Carl Jung drew upon in his psychology of archetypes. Although the myth isnot literally true, it may in some way be literarily true. The Cayce ‘readings’themselves say, in their own way, that the inner world of symbols and archetypesis more ‘real’ than the particulars of the physical world. I compared Cayce’sHall of Records to the Wizard of Oz. Yes, we all want the ‘sound and fury’ andpowerful wizardry to be real, without having to pay attention to the little manbehind the curtain (ourselves). In archaeology, many dilettantes and New Agerswant to be on the trail of a lost civilization, aliens, yes, ‘the gods’, withouthaving to pay attention to the real people behind time’s curtain and withouthaving to deal with the difficult subject matter upon which so-called ‘orthodox’scholars base their views.(An aside: So a John West can blast Egyptologists for suppressing the sacredscience inherent in Egyptian culture without being able to read Egyptianlanguage—a little like saying one knows Shakespeare’s real meaning withoutreading English. Another pyramid theorist said, in an animated dinnerconversation, ‘Where’s the evidence? The pyramid stands out there with noevidence of how the ancient Egyptians could have built it.’ I ticked off fourEgyptological titles—all in English—devoted to ancient Egyptian tools,technology, stone building, and materials and industries. Although he hadpublished a widely acclaimed book with a new theory on the pyramids, he admittedto not having read a single one of these basic works. It would be so much morefun and challenging if such theorists did actually read and absorb such primarysources, and then launched the dialogue.)These ideas were on my mind as I joined my first ‘mainstream’ excavation in1976. They are reflected in my statement that the Hall of Records is worthlooking for, but not in a tangible way. You know, like the Holy Grail.In 1977-78 I had the opportunity not only to work with the SRI project at Giza,but also to work with Zahi Hawass in excavations of ancient deposits neglectedby earlier archaeologists in the northeast corner of the Sphinx floor—justbeside the north forepaw, and on the floor of the Sphinx Temple. We recoveredpottery, parts of stone tools, and other material directly on the floor, fillingdeep crevasses and nooks and crannies—material in contexts that only make senseas left by the Old Kingdom Sphinx and pyramid builders.Such findings, and the negative results of the SRI project, sealed it for me.That is, I knew there was an extremely low probability that Cayce’s story ofEgypt and the Giza monuments (and his ancient ‘history’ involving Atlantis,etc.) reflected real events.My interest in the Cayce-like genre of literature as having anything to do withthe archaeological record was gone, although I am still interested in this genreas a social and literary phenomenon. My encounters with bedrock reality were farmore fascinating. I was excited by the process of reconstructing the past fromempirical evidence. I put aside my interest in the dynamics of beliefs, and ingeneral questions of philosophy and religion, as I spent the next decade doingarchaeological fieldwork for projects at various places in Egypt. At Giza, myinterest and research was no longer premised on Cayce or any similar point ofview. In 1982 I carried out the research and writing for an Egyptologicalmonograph on the tomb of Hetepheres (published in 1985 by the GermanArchaeological Institute). Cayce ideas had nothing to do with this work.Meanwhile Hugh Lynn Cayce (until he died), Charles Thomas Cayce and othermembers of the Cayce community remained very close friends. Some (but not all)were still interested in contributing to research at Giza. Their support of thePyramids Radiocarbon Dating Project was a way to do something useful for thearchaeology of the pyramids, as well as to test their ideas about the origin anddate of the Great Pyramid and Sphinx.I remember a very personal moment in 1983 when I was working for an expeditionat Abydos, the cult center of Osiris in Upper Egypt. The tombs of Egypt’searliest pharaohs were sunk into a spur of low desert far to the west of thecultivation, near the base of the great cleft in the high cliffs, probably seenby the ancients as symbolizing the entrance to the Netherworld. Many centurieslater, one of the tombs of a real man who ruled as one of the First Dynastykings was outfitted as the Tomb of Osiris. Over subsequent centuries hundreds ofpilgrims left pottery offerings, resulting in mounds of millions of shards thatmasked the site, prompting its Arabic name, Umm el-Qa-ab, ‘Mother of Pots’. Oneevening near sunset I walked from the dig house to Umm el-Qa-ab. I stood on themounds above these tombs and wondered if the ancient pilgrims really believedthe god Osiris himself was buried here, and if ‘those who sit near the temple’(as a Zen proverb would say)—the local priests—knew they had simply outfittedone of the First Dynasty tombs of a pharaoh to ‘symbolize’ the burial of Osiris.I thought of my own pilgrimage that brought me to Egypt in the first place, andthe myth of the Hall of Records. I realized that this was part of a world viewthat had moved far away from me, like a chunk of ice that had separated from acontinent and was now melting in a distant sea.Sorry to be so long-winded. But Graham, I agree with your statement in your lastletter that readers should be in possession of the facts to evaluate theopinions of academic authorities.Sincerely,Mark LehnerPS Details: It probably does not matter much for a popular readership, but thedifference between an Assistant Professor—my title at the Oriental Institute—andProfessor is significant in the tenure-track world. I resigned my fulltime post,but I am still a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago andOriental Institute, I return every other year to teach.cc: Bruce LudwigDouglas RawlsTo: Mark LehnerFrom: Graham Hancock8 December 1995Dear Mark,Thank you for your further letter of 16 November 1995 in response to our reviseddraft of Chapter 5. We greatly appreciate your openness.If you have no objections, we propose to publish the revised draft of Chapter 5as you have seen it and to publish your 16 November 1995 letter in full as anappendix to our book. We consider this to be a fair and reasonable way topresent the whole matter to the public. If we don’t hear back from you in thenext couple of weeks we will assume this is OK with you.Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!Warm best wishes,Graham HancockPS We remember one Egyptological title (not four) that you ‘ticked off’ during acertain ‘animated dinner conversation’. The one title was Clarke and Engelbach’sAncient Egyptian Construction and Architecture. We’ve both read it since andweren’t overly impressed. Robert Bauval, as you know, is a construction engineerby training and spent twenty years actually building enormous buildings in theMiddle East. In my opinion—Clarke and Engelbach notwithstanding—this gives him arather good basis from which to engage in ‘fun and challenging’ dialogue aboutthe construction logistics of the Great Pyramid. There’s no substitute for realexperience no matter how many ‘primary sources’ we ‘read and absorb’. (And bythe way, in what sense are Clarke and Engelbach a primary source? Were theypresent when the Pyramid was built? Did they build it?)"},{"pageContent":"Appendix 3> > Harnessing Time with the Stars:> > The Hermetic Axiom ‘As Above So Below’> > and the Horizon of GizaAn observer at Giza, as anywhere else on the globe where the horizontal view isnot obstructed, will perceive the landscape as a huge circle whose edge is thehorizon with himself at the centre—hence the term ‘Horizon’ used by the ancientswhen referring to the Giza necropolis. Making apparent contact with the horizonis the celestial landscape, the latter perceived as a huge circular dome orhemisphere.The ‘below’, earth-landscape, is steadfast. The ‘above’, sky-landscape, however,appears to rotate in perpetual motion around an imaginary axis which passesthrough the two poles of the earth and extends to the ‘celestial poles’ in thesky. The apparent rotation of the sky makes the celestial orbs—the stars, thesun, the moon and the planets—rise in the east, culminate at the meridian (animaginary loop running due north-south directly over the observer’s head) andset in the west.Observations of sunrise through the year will fix four distinct points,sometimes called the colures, on the ecliptic path of the sun around the twelvezodiacal constellations. These are the two equinoxes (spring and autumn), andthe two solstices (summer and winter). Today these take place in the followingzodiacal signs:1. Spring equinox (21 March) with the sun in Pisces.2. Summer solstice (21 June) with the sun in Taurus.3. Autumn equinox (22 September) with the sun in Virgo.4. Winter solstice (21 December) with the sun in Sagittarius.The table below shows in which zodiacal signs the four ‘colures’ fell for avariety of different epochs:EPOCH10,000 BC5000 BC3000 BC1000 BC2500 ADS. EquinoxLeoGeminiTaurusAriesAquariusS. SolsticeScorpioVirgoLeoCancerTaurusA. EquinoxAquariusSagittariusScorpioLibraLeoW. SolsticeTaurusPiscesAquariusCapricornScorpioStrictly speaking, the term ‘colures’ denotes the two great circles of thecelestial sphere which are at right angles to each other, pass through the polesand intersect the two equinox points and the two solstice points respectively.The diurnal or daily apparent motion of the sun is from east to west. The annualor yearly apparent motion is much slower from west to east against thebackground of the starry landscape through a path known as the ecliptic, orzodiacal circle (containing the twelve zodiacal signs). Also because of thephenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes, the four points on the colures(the two equinoxes and the two solstices) will appear to drift westwards at thevery slow rate of 50.3 arc-seconds per year (a full circuit in approximately 25,920 years).These apparent cyclical motions of the sky are, of course, caused not by the skyitself moving but by the earth’s own spin on its axis in one day, its orbitalrevolution around the sun in one year, and its slow wobble-like motion in oneGreat Year (of 25,920 ‘solar’ years). As we have already said, the mostnoticeable effect of the latter is that the four points on the colures whichmark the two equinoxes and the two solstices on the ecliptic, will drift inclockwise direction along the great ecliptic or ‘zodiacal’ circle.Every day there is a moment when these four points on the colures findthemselves in precise alignment with the four cardinal points of the terrestrialglobe defined by the directions due east, due south, due west and due north onthe circle of the horizon. This is when it can be said that the sky and earthare a ‘reflection’ of each other. In archaic terminology, this is when the‘Hermetic’ axiom of ‘as above so below’ can be most faithfully expressed.At this exact moment the colure containing the two solstice points will belooping above the head of the observer from north to south, and thus becomes theprime meridian of the observer. The colure which contains the two equinox pointswill loop from east to west and will intersect the horizon at due east to duewest, and thus define the parallel of the observer. Again, using archaicterminology, this is when the observer is at the ‘centre of the visibleuniverse’.A simple yet quite precise way of knowing when this idealistic ‘as above sobelow’ conjunction takes place is to make use of a bright star that sits on thecolure containing the two solstice points. The choice of a bright star on thecolure as near to the winter solstice point as possible, will permit theobserver to lock the sky in the most favourable condition possible: the precisemoment of the rising of the vernal (spring) point in the east. This is simplyachieved by waiting for the star in question to transit the south meridian. Whenthis happens, the winter solstice point is due south, and all the other colureslock to the remaining cardinal directions.The effect of the precession of the vernal point, however, will cause the chosenstar to change position with time. After a century or so the star can no longerbe used.The Great Pyramid is often said to be perfectly set to the four cardinal points.What seems more likely, as we shall see, is that it is set perfectly to the fourcolure points when they transit the cardinal directions. The setting-out of thePyramid, therefore, is not merely directional but also, and perhaps moreespecially, dependent on ‘time’.In 1934 the French astronomer E.M. Antoniadi correctly noted that the‘astronomical character of the pyramids (of Giza) is established by thefollowing facts:1. They are almost exactly, and intentionally, on the thirtieth parallelof the latitude North.2. They are marvellously orientated on the cardinal points.3. Their inclined passageways were, with their closing, colossal meridianinstruments, by far the largest ever constructed.’[703][index_split_036.html#filepos908308]These confirmed facts, and also the fact that the Great Pyramid is anear-perfect mathematical model of the celestial dome or hemisphere, make thismonument a material and earthly representation of the sky-landscape. When linkedto a specific star, however, the element of ‘time’ is introduced into theequation.We recall that the ancient builders fixed the main north-south axis of the GreatPyramid to the south meridian transit of the bright star Alnitak, the lowest ofthe three stars in Orion’s belt. We also recall that the general layout of thethree Pyramids of Giza is at 45 degrees to the meridian axis and that thispeculiarity, in turn, is reflected in the sky-image of the three stars inOrion’s belt as they appeared in c. 10,500 BC. This was no arbitrary date,however, because it denoted the lowest point or ‘First Time’ in the precessionalcycle of Orion. To the ancients, Orion was ‘Osiris’, and the latter, too, had a‘First Time’ or genesis.Computer reconstructions of the ancient skies of 10,500 BC show that the starAlnitak was located precisely on the colure containing the two solstice points,and nearer to the winter solstice. If an observer was there to ‘lock’ theperfect ‘as above so below’ condition in 10,500 BC, the image of the skycontaining the star Alnitak would convert into a ‘hologram’ on the groundprecisely in the manner we find at Giza today. That such a perfect sky-to-earthcorrelation cannot be the result of some incredible ‘coincidence’ is confirmedby the equinoctial rising of Leo, which took place in precisely the same epochof 10,500 BC and precisely when the star Alnitak transited the south meridian.This brought the vernal (spring) equinox point in perfect alignment with theGreat Sphinx, the terrestrial counterpart of the image of Leo. The conclusionthus seems inevitable: the ancients appear to have established a globalprime-meridian at Giza locked into the time frame of 10,500 BC.All this implies, however, that the ancients were somehow attempting to‘navigate’ not only in distance (‘space’) but also in ‘time’. What did they havein mind? How can ‘time’ be navigated?Hypothetically at least, a time-related apparatus locked into the colures of10,500 BC would present the ‘reincarnated’ Horus-King with a subliminallandscape or ‘magical theatre’, at the height of his extensive initiation, towork out intuitively how far in time his ‘soul’ had travelled from its point ofgenesis. In Parts III and IV of this book we have shown how the Horus-King mayhave used the phenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes to perform such atask by inducing his mind to undertake a journey or quest to find his‘ancestors’ using the subliminal architectural setting or ‘cosmic ambiance’ ofGiza as some sort of ‘star-memory’ device. Today we use a computer to re-createthe ancient skies on a television monitor. We are suggesting that the Horus-Kinginitiate could perform this task intuitively with the ‘computer’ of his mind andthe ‘monitor’ of his inner perception. This conclusion does not present aproblem to us. We have found that by fully familiarizing ourselves with theapparent motions of the skies and by constantly reconstructing ancient skieswith the aid of computers, images, coordinates and epochs subliminally enter themind and become logged in the memory. We have discovered for ourselves thatthese ‘files’ are easily retrieved at will without the mechanistic aid of thecomputer. Hypothetically then, with such ‘star-memory’ logged in the mind,should we suddenly find ourselves flung into a future ‘time zone’, say AD 6000,we could relatively easily ‘work out’ how far ahead in time we had moved.By extension of such rhetoric, therefore, it could be said that the function ofthe Giza blueprint is to provide a virtually indestructible ‘holographic’apparatus for the use of ‘reincarnated’ or ‘reborn’ entities of the Horianlineage in order to induce ‘remembrance’ of a ‘divine’ genetic origin in Egyptin the time-frame of 10,500 BC. The ultimate function, however, appears to havebeen to perpetuate the ‘immortality’ of their souls into ‘time’—in short, theultimate gnostic experience entailing the release of the spiritual part of theliving entity from its material, inert, part. To put it in other terms, ‘living’man is the result of a holographic union between matter and spirit. It wouldvery much appear that the ‘Followers of Horus’ understood the cosmic mechanismto somehow re-separate the two.Such questions, we are well aware, lead us into the misty realm of metaphysics,extrasensory perception and psychic thinking from which we have tried to steerclear. Nonetheless, we must respond to our intuitive feeling that a form ofmetaphysical thinking very much like this was used by those mysterious‘Followers of Horus’ who set their initiatory and ‘astronomical’ academy atHeliopolis—and whose genius resulted in the construction of the amazing‘holographic’ star/stone (spirit/matter) apparatus of Giza. All references inthe ancient texts to this mysterious brotherhood suggest that we are dealing notwith ‘priests’ but with high adepts who fully understood the working of thehuman psyche and the subliminal techniques needed to evoke ‘remote memory’through deep-felt inner perceptions of ‘time’. The esoteric teachings andinitiations into such cosmic mysteries using the skies are certainly not prosaicones, as Egyptologists maintain, to develop and refine calendrical systems for‘land irrigation’ and ‘religious ceremonies’, but far more subtle: somehow toreach and harness the extrasensory capabilities of the human mind in order tolink up to the invisible and immaterial, yet very perceptible, ‘flux of time’.The questions, for those looking for ‘scientific’ explanations, can beformulated in another way: Do we humans carry ‘remote memory files’ locked inour genes? And if so, can it not be possible that such ‘files’ could beretrieved by using the correct subliminal keys?More provocative still: is our ‘consciousness’ umbilically linked to ‘time’ suchthat it merely passes through biological matter, ourselves, like a threadpassing through pearls and stones?It has long been appreciated by students of intellectual history that monumentalarchitecture and archetypal images can serve as powerful subliminal devices toevoke dormant ‘memory’ in the minds of those who are made receptive throughinitiation. The murals and panels of gothic cathedrals or the painted ceilingssuch as those in the Sistine Chapel are but obvious examples of such powerfulmind-games—aptly called ‘silent poetry’ by the fourth-century BC poet, Simonidesof Ceos. These ancient memory-aids, and the techniques refined for using them,which are loosely termed ‘mnemotechnics’ today, were the subject of a majorthesis by Dame Frances A. Yates in 1966 entitled The Art of Memory. In this bookYates shows that powerful cerebral techniques were taught in ancient Greecewhich were rooted in the so-called ‘Egyptian hermetic tradition’.[704][index_split_036.html#filepos908459] Recently, the author Murry Hope, in athesis entitled Time the Ultimate Energy, tackled the complex subject of ‘timetravel’ as a form of energy, and suggested that pre-dynastic Egyptian adepts mayhave understood and harnessed ‘time’ through a yet-to-be discovered ability tobreak away from the confines of biological ‘time’ and into another mental realmof time-perception. Murry Hope termed this realm ‘Outer Time’. Likewise, inanother recent study, From Atlantis to the Sphinx, the author and philosopherColin Wilson boldly proposes that the ancients may have cultivated powerfulextrasensory capabilities through ‘a different knowledge system’ based onintuitive thinking (as opposed to rationalistic or ‘solar’ thinking) in order toenter higher states of consciousness. Such higher consciousness might have beenthe key into altered perceptions of ‘time’.That such untapped abilities to perceive dilated time-fields might be anintrinsic part of human mental machinery was very seriously investigated by oneof America’s most prestigious scientific foundations, the Stanford ResearchInstitute in California—better known as SRI International. In 1972 SRIInternational was recruited as main consultant for the so-called remote viewingprogrammes run by the CIA and other government agencies including the US navy,the US army and the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). These programmes weremanaged by a highly respected physicist, Dr. Hal Puthoff, who sought out andemployed renowned psychics (called ‘remote viewers’ in SRI jargon) to ‘locate’enemy military targets and installations using extrasensory capabilities.The reader will recall that SRI International (which has been described as‘America’s second largest think-tank’) was also, in 1973, involved in high-techarchaeological projects in Egypt and, at least on one occasion, worked inparticipation with the Edgar Cayce Foundation (ECF) in a series of remotesensing projects at Giza (see Chapter 5).Many ‘remote viewers’ involved in the remote viewing programmes, such as thepsychic Ingo Swann and Nel Riley, the latter a sergeant in the US army, openlyclaimed to have the inner abilities to undertake a form of ‘time travel’ intoany remote locations on the globe. Such claims are in many ways reminiscent ofthose made by the Edgar Cayce adepts who maintain that, when in an altered stateof consciousness such as deep trance or hypnosis, they can ‘remember’ pastlives, i.e. ‘time travel’ mentally to remote locations. Cayce himself, who isdubbed America’s best-known medium and psychic, claimed to have had a previouslife in Egypt in 10,500 BC—a claim which at one time, as we have seen in Chapter5, was considered worthy of investigation by Egyptologist Mark Lehner in theearly 1970s within the framework of his scientific research at Giza."},{"pageContent":"Appendix 4> > Carbon-dating the Great Pyramid:> > Implications of a little-known StudyThe evidence presented in this book concerning the origins and antiquity of themonuments of the Giza necropolis suggests that the genesis and original planningand layout of the site may be dated, using the tools of modern computer-aidedarchaeoastronomy, to the epoch of 10,500 BC. We have also argued, on the basisof a combination of geological, architectural and archaeoastronomicalindicators, that the Great Sphinx, its associated megalithic ‘temples’, and atleast the lower courses of the so-called ‘Pyramid of Khafre’, may in fact havebeen built at that exceedingly remote date.It is important to note that we do not date the construction of the GreatPyramid to 10,500 BC. On the contrary, we point out that its internalastronomical alignments—the star-shafts of the King’s and Queen’s Chambers—areconsistent with a completion date during ancient Egypt’s ‘Old Kingdom’,somewhere around 2500 BC. Such a date should, in itself, be uncontroversialsince it in no way contradicts the scholarly consensus that the monument wasbuilt by Khufu, the second Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty, who ruled from2551-2528 BC.[705] [index_split_036.html#filepos908618] What places our theoryin sharp contradiction to the orthodox view, however, is our suggestion that themysterious structures of the Giza necropolis may all be the result of anenormously long-drawn-out period of architectural elaboration and development—aperiod that had its genesis in 10,500 BC, that came to an end with thecompletion of the Great Pyramid come 8000 years later in 2500 BC, and that wasguided throughout by a unified master-plan.According to orthodox Egyptologists, the Great Pyramid is the result of onlyjust over 100 years of architectural development, beginning with theconstruction of the step-pyramid of Zoser at Saqqara not earlier than 2630 BC,passing through a number of ‘experimental’ models of true Pyramids (one atMeidum and at two Dashour, all attributed to Khufu’s father Sneferu) and leadinginexorably to the technological mastery of the Great Pyramid not earlier than2551 BC (the date of Khufu’s own ascension to the throne). An evolutionary‘sequence’ in pyramid-construction thus lies at the heart of the orthodoxEgyptological theory—a sequence in which the Great Pyramid is seen as havingevolved from (and thus having been preceded by) the four earlier pyramids.[706][index_split_036.html#filepos908802]But suppose those four pyramids were proved to be not earlier but laterstructures? Suppose, for example, that objective and unambiguous archaeologicalevidence were to emerge—say, reliable carbon-dated samples—which indicated thatwork on the Great Pyramid had in fact begun some 1300 years before the birth ofKhufu and that the monument had stood substantially complete some 300 yearsbefore his accession to the throne? Such evidence, if it existed, would renderobsolete the orthodox Egyptological theory about the origins, function anddating of the Great Pyramid since it would destroy the Saqqaraà Meidumà DashouràGiza ‘sequence’ by making the technologically-advanced Great Pyramid far olderthan its supposed oldest ‘ancestor’, the far more rudimentary step-pyramid ofZoser. With the sequence no longer valid, it would then be even more difficultthan it, is at present for scholars to explain the immense architecturalcompetence and precision of the Great Pyramid (since it defies reason to supposethat such advanced and sophisticated work could have been undertaken by builderswith no prior knowledge of monumental architecture).Curiously, objective evidence does exist which casts serious doubt on theorthodox archaeological sequence. This evidence was procured and published in1986 by the Pyramids Carbon-dating Project, directed by Mark Lehner (andreferred to in passing in his correspondence with us, see Appendix III above).With funding from the Edgar Cayce Foundation, Lehner collected fifteen samplesof ancient mortar from the masonry of the Great Pyramid. These samples of mortarwere chosen because they contained fragments of organic material which, unlikenatural stone, would be susceptible to carbon-dating. Two of the samples weretested in the Radiocarbon Laboratory of the Southern Methodist University inDallas Texas and the other thirteen were taken to laboratories in Zurich,Switzerland, for dating by the more sophisticated accelerator method. Accordingto proper procedure, the results were then calibrated and confirmed with respectto tree-ring samples.[707] [index_split_036.html#filepos909056]The outcome was surprising. As Mark Lehner commented at the time:The dates run from 3809 BC to 2869 BC. So generally the dates are ...significantly earlier than the best Egyptological date for Khufu ... In short,the radiocarbon dates, depending on which sample you note, suggest that theEgyptological chronology is anything from 200 to 1200 years off. You can look atthis almost like a bell curve, and when you cut it down the middle you cansummarize the results by saying our dates are 400 to 450 years too early for theOld Kingdom Pyramids, especially those of the Fourth Dynasty ... Now this isreally radical ... I mean it’ll make a big stink. The Giza pyramid is 400 yearsolder than Egyptologists believe.[708] [index_split_036.html#filepos909197]Despite Lehner’s insistence that the carbon-dating was conducted according torigorous scientific procedures[709] [index_split_036.html#filepos909283](enough, normally, to qualify these dates for full acceptance by scholars) it isa strange fact that almost no ‘stink’ at all has been caused by his study. Onthe contrary, its implications have been and continue to be universally ignoredby Egyptologists and have not been widely published or considered in either theacademic or the popular press. We are at a loss to explain this apparent failureof scholarship and are equally unable to understand why there has been no moveto extract and carbon-date further samples of the Great Pyramid’s mortar inorder to test Lehner’s potentially revolutionary results.What has to be considered, however, is the unsettling possibility that some kindof pattern may underlie these strange oversights.As we reported in Chapter 6, a piece of wood that had been sealed inside theshafts of the Queen’s Chamber since completion of construction work on thatroom, was amongst the unique collection of relics brought out of the GreatPyramid in 1872 by the British engineer Waynman Dixon. The other two ‘Dixonrelics’—the small metal hook and the stone sphere—have been located after havingbeen ‘misplaced’ by the British Museum for a very long while. The whereabouts ofthe piece of wood, however, is today unknown.[710][index_split_036.html#filepos909380]This is very frustrating. Being organic, wood can be accurately carbon-dated.Since this particular piece of wood is known to have been sealed inside thePyramid at the time of construction of the monument, radiocarbon results from itcould, theoretically, confirm the date when that construction took place.A missing piece of wood cannot be tested. Fortunately, however, as we alsoreported in Chapter 6, it is probable that another such piece of wood is stillin situ at some depth inside the northern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber. Thispiece was clearly visible in film, taken by Rudolf Gantenbrink’s robot-cameraUpuaut, that was shown to a gathering of senior Egyptologists at the BritishMuseum on 22 November 1993.[711] [index_split_036.html#filepos909522]We are informed that it would be a relatively simple and inexpensive task toextract the piece of wood from the northern shaft. More than two and a halfyears after that screening at the British Museum, however, no attempt has beenmade to take advantage of this opportunity. The piece of wood still sits there,its age unknown, and Rudolf Gantenbrink, as we saw in Chapter 6, has not beenpermitted to complete his exploration of the shafts."},{"pageContent":"Appendix 5> > The Door Inside the Great Pyramid;> > Tunnels and Chambers> > Under the Great SphinxFurther developmentsSince the first English-language edition of this book went to press in February1996 there have been a number of significant developments concerning the openingof the door in the Great Pyramid at the end of the southern shaft of the Queen’sChamber (see in particular Chapter 7) and the search for tunnels and chambersunder the Great Sphinx (see in particular Chapter 2 and Chapter 5). Weanticipate that there will be further developments—quite possibly of majorhistorical significance—which we will cover in a future book. It is ourintention, meanwhile, to monitor this ‘running story’ and to update our readersin a series of appendices that will be published in future editions of TheMessage of the Sphinx.The update presented herewith covers the period from March to end-August 1996.The Great PyramidAt the end of 1995, as reported in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, the position of theEgyptian Antiquities Organization regarding the ‘door’ at the end of thesouthern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber was apparently one of officialdisinterest. The reader will recall that Dr. Nur El Din, Chairman of the EAO(now renamed the Supreme Council of Antiquities) had declined RudolfGantenbrink’s offer to donate the robot to the Egyptian government and to trainan Egyptian technician to operate it: ‘Thank you for your offer to train theEgyptian technician ... Unfortunately we are very busy for the time being,therefore we will postpone the matter ...[712][index_split_036.html#filepos909782] Similarly Dr. Zahi Hawass had declared: ‘Ido not think this is a door and nothing is behind it.’[713][index_split_036.html#filepos909903]In March 1996, however, Dr. Hawass changed his mind, declaring in the EgyptianGazette that Gantenbrink’s find was of huge interest and that the door would beopened in September 1996 by a multinational team led by the Egyptian geologist(and NASA consultant) Dr. Farouk El Baz. Rudolf Gantenbrink would not beinvolved and ‘another robot’—not Upuaut—would be used to explore the shaft.Participating in the exploration would be a ‘Canadian’ contingent.[714][index_split_036.html#filepos910025]The Canadian element, ‘Amtex’, is headed by Peter Zuuring, a wealthyDutch-Canadian businessman, who told us that he had shown the Egyptians how thedoor could be opened ‘relatively inexpensively ... We’re working with SparAerospace to design a miniature arm with tools that could first tap the door,knock it and try to lever things a little bit to see if there’s anything loose.But I think ultimately we’ll go straight through.’In two conversations, Souring told us that he thought it unlikely that theproject could start as early as September 1996: the following year, he said,1997, was far more likely. The objective, which might take some time, was toraise the huge sum of ten million dollars to promote a staged ‘live opening’ ofthe door on international television networks. ‘I’m working with a private guywho is a personal friend of Hawass and we are absolutely going to drum thisthing to death. Whatever the event we are going to stage, it will be televisedlive.’[715] [index_split_036.html#filepos910145]The Great SphinxIn 1993-4 (see Chapter 2 and Chapter 5) Dr. Zahi Hawass appeared to be adamantlyopposed to the notion that the Sphinx might be far older than ancient Egypt—andthus the work of a lost civilization. The reader will recall that the EAOofficial was particularly incensed by the NBC television film, The Mystery ofthe Sphinx, that was made about the work of John Anthony West. In additionHawass had been personally responsible for expelling John West and his researchteam from the Sphinx enclosure. The team included the geologist Robert Schoch, aProfessor at Boston University, and the seismologist Thomas Dobecki (who was toidentify a large rectangular chamber concealed in the bedrock at a depth ofabout twenty feet beneath the front paws of the Sphinx).The NBC documentary linked the Sphinx to Atlantis and suggested that the chamberthat Thomas Dobecki’s seismograph had detected beneath its paws might containsome sort of ‘time capsule’ of Atlantean wisdom and history. Hawass called theseclaims: ‘American hallucinations. West is an amateur. There is absolutely noscientific base for any of this. We have older monuments in the same area. Theydefinitely weren’t built by men from Atlantis. It’s nonsense and we won’t allowour monuments to be exploited for personal enrichment. The Sphinx is the soul ofEgypt.’[716] [index_split_036.html#filepos910270]An article in the Egyptian press responding to the NBC film quoted Dr. Hawass onhis further reasons for expelling John West and his team from the Sphinxenclosure: ‘I have found that their work is carried out by installing endoscopesin the Sphinx’s body and shooting films for all phases of the work in apropaganda ... but not in a scientific manner. I therefore suspended the work ofthis unscientific mission and made a report which was presented to the permanentcommission who rejected the mission’s work in the future.’[717][index_split_036.html#filepos910384]The NBC film was produced by Boris Said (see Chapter 2) and partially financedby investments from members of the Association for Research and Enlightenment(ARE). Headquartered in Virginia Beach in the United States (see Chapter 5), theARE is a multimillion dollar organization that exists to promulgate theteachings and prophecies of the American psychic Edgar Cayce, who died in 1945.Prominent amongst Cayce’s pronouncements were many statements—some of which werereported in the NBC film—to the effect that the Sphinx had been built in 10,500BC by the survivors of Atlantis who had concealed beneath it a ‘Hall of Records’containing all the wisdom of their lost civilization and the true history of thehuman race. Cayce prophesied that this Hall of Records would be rediscovered andopened between 1996 and 1998. He connected the opening to the second coming ofChrist and asserted that the contents of the Hall would not be shared with thegeneral public until many years after it had first been entered by ‘three whowould make of the perfect way of life.’[718][index_split_036.html#filepos910505]In 1995 John West and Professor Robert Schoch of Boston University (incooperation with the prestigious Princeton Engineering Anomalies ResearchLaboratory, better known as PEAR) put in an application to the Egyptianauthorities to resume their research. Their application was ignored.At the end of March 1996 the Egyptian authorities granted a one-year license toa new team to conduct surveys around the Sphinx and the Giza necropolis usingseismic equipment and ground-penetrating radar. This team, which claimedacademic sponsorship from Florida State University (and reportedly involved theparticipation of four geologists from that university), was largely financed,through the Schor Foundation of New York, by Dr. Joseph Schor, an Americanmultimillionaire. Dr. Schor is a life-member of the ARE and was one of the twoARE members who met us at Virginia Beach with Charles Thomas Cayce in May 1994(see Chapter 5). Later that month he wrote to us of his great personal interestin corroborating ‘the Cayce records which indicated that the culture which ledto the building of the Pyramids dates from 10,500 BC.’ He also stated his wish‘to further delineate that civilization.’[719][index_split_036.html#filepos910695]On 11 April 1996, when we informed Joseph Schor that we intended to write aboutthese matters in the London Daily Mail, he threatened us with a libel action andstated: ‘We do not work for the Edgar Cayce group ... The major purpose of theSchor Foundation and the Florida State University is to aid in the preservationand restoration of the Pyramids and Sphinx. In addition we are surveying theunderground of the Giza Plateau to find faults and chasms that might collapse.This will increase the safety of the plateau because chasms and faults can becollapsed or roped off for the protection of tourists and plateaupersonnel.’[720] [index_split_036.html#filepos910800]On 14 April 1996 Dr. Zahi Hawass gave a rather different account, mentioninghidden tunnels around the Pyramids and the Sphinx. He made no mention of thequestion of public safety but hinted that ‘excavation of the tunnels wouldreveal many clues regarding the establishment of the Giza pyramids.’[721][index_split_036.html#filepos910929]Nor did that question appear to be the main thrust of a short video, SecretChamber, in which Dr. Hawass took part. Filmed on location in Cairo in Novemberand December 1995, the video was produced and written by Boris Said and,according to him, financed to the tune of one hundred thousand dollars by JosephSchor. In this video, as we reported at the end of Chapter 5, Dr. Hawass isshown scrambling into a tunnel under the Sphinx. When he reaches the bottom heturns to face the camera and whispers to the viewer: ‘Even Indiana Jones willnever dream to be here. Can you believe it? We are now inside the Sphinx, inthis tunnel. This tunnel has never been opened before. No one really knowswhat’s inside this tunnel but we are going to open it for the first time.’[722][index_split_036.html#filepos911049]The narrator of the video drives home an interesting point: ‘Edgar Cayce,America’s famous “Sleeping Prophet”, predicted that a chamber would bediscovered beneath the Sphinx—a chamber containing the recorded history of humancivilization. For the first time ever we’ll show you what lies beneath thisgreat statue—a chamber which will be opened, live, for our televisioncameras.’[723] [index_split_036.html#filepos911183]In July 1996, after worldwide protest over the activities of the SchorFoundation and Florida State University at the Sphinx, Dr. Hawass claimed onSouth African radio that he had halted the project: ‘I found that their work isnot following the correct steps ... I wrote a letter to them saying that theycannot do work again because they are not really following the correctwork.’[724] [index_split_036.html#filepos911269]That same month, however, rumors began to circulate that the team had identifiednine further tunnels or chambers under the Giza Plateau. In all of them,apparently, their remote-sensing equipment had identified objects made of metal.By the end of August 1996, despite Hawass’s statement, team members stillappeared confident that their project would go ahead and Boris Said was reputedto be negotiating with major television networks in the United States for anexclusive documentary on the Sphinx.The Edgar Cayce legacyAs we saw in Chapter 5, Edgar Cayce (known in America as the ‘Sleeping Prophet’because he gave his psychic ‘readings’ in a trance-like state) believed himselfto be a reincarnated priest called Ra-Ta, a survivor of Atlantis who had settledin Egypt in 10,500 BC. Throughout the 1930s, until his death in 1945, he usedthe contacts made through his ‘readings’ to ‘pick up players’—artists, bankers,businessmen, university professors and even politicians—who were all convincedthat in their ‘past lives’ they too had played a role in the unfolding drama ofAtlantis.[725] [index_split_036.html#filepos911385]One of these players, perhaps the most active the ARE would know, was Cayce’seldest son, Hugh Lynn (1907-1983), a graduate of Harvard University who tookover the management of the newly founded ARE in 1931 when he was justtwenty-four years old. With youthful enthusiasm, he vowed that one day an ‘AREsponsored expedition’ to Giza would vindicate his father’s prophecies concerningthe Hall of Records.[726] [index_split_036.html#filepos911568]Perhaps Hugh Lynn had been inspired by the so-called ‘Baraize Expedition’ to theSphinx which was already well underway in 1930 when the ARE was founded. Led bythe then Director of the Egyptian Antiquities Department, a French archaeologistnamed Emile Baraize, this expedition stripped off the ancient skin of ‘repairblocks’ from the lower parts of the body of the Sphinx. While removing some ofthe blocks from the rump of the statue, Baraize came across the entrance to atunnel. Then, for some extraordinary reason, he resealed the mouth of the tunnelwith rock and cement and never reported the matter. With Baraize at the time wasa young Arab boy called Mohamad Abdel Mawgud—whose descendants still live atGiza.[727] [index_split_036.html#filepos911735]The Baraize expedition ran from 1926 to 1936. But it was not until 1972 thatHugh Lynn Cayce, by then in his sixties, finally set in motion the plan that hehad long ago conceived for getting the ARE into mainstream archaeology at Giza.His first move was to recruit a ‘college dropout named Mark Lehner’ (the AREPresident thought he recognized the young man from a past life), and thenarrange for him to take a post-graduate degree at the American University inCairo. Today the Visiting Professor of Egyptology at the University of Chicago’sprestigious Oriental Institute, we saw in Chapter 5 how Lehner became the ARE’s‘man’ at Giza, participating during the 1970s and 1980s in almost everyimportant project undertaken around the Pyramids and the Sphinx.Despite a number of setbacks experienced by the ARE as a result of theseprojects, an official biography reports that Hugh Lynn Cayce ‘had no sense ofdefeat ... He would stay with the search as long as it took, building allianceswith other groups and individuals. One of the latter was the Egyptian ChiefInspector at Giza, Hawass, who he had met through Lehner in 1975. In 1980,Hawass accommodated the ARE by conducting an excavation in front of the Sphinxtemple ...’[728] [index_split_036.html#filepos911866]In October 1980 Mark Lehner made contact with Mohamad Abdel Mawgud, the ‘youngArab boy’ (by now in his sixties) who had seen Emile Baraize seal up the tunnelunder the Sphinx in 1926. Together with Ahmed Al Fayed, Abdel Mawgud’s son,Lehner was permitted by Zahi Hawass to remove the seal and enter the tunnel. Butagain, apparently, nothing was found. The tunnel reached a ‘dead end’ in thebedrock underneath the Sphinx.[729] [index_split_036.html#filepos912059]Soon afterwards Ahmed Al Fayed went to settle in Virginia Beach and in duecourse joined the staff of the ARE. Hawass also traveled to the United States atabout this time to expand his formal education in Egyptology. As Hugh LynnCayce’s biographer reports: ‘If Zahi Hawass was to advance within the [Egyptian]government to further his own career and open doors for Hugh Lynn’s project, hecould do it best on the wings of higher education at an American Ivy Leaguecollege.’ Just before he died Hugh Lynn Cayce was to explain how: ‘I got him[Zahi Hawass] a scholarship at the University of Pennsylvania in Egyptology, toget his Ph.D. I got the scholarship through an ARE person who happens to be onthe Fulbright scholarship board. He [Hawass] had aided Mark [Lehner] to work onthe Sphinx and I am very appreciative.’[730][index_split_036.html#filepos912171]Interviewed on South African radio in July 1996 Hawass responded to an earlierinterview given by ourselves in which we had mentioned his apparent connectionswith the Edgar Cayce Foundation. He accused us of lying, stated that we weremerely claiming these things to make ourselves famous, and insisted that hediscredited Edgar Cayce, adding emphatically: ‘The Edgar Cayce theory is wrong.’The interviewer (John Robbie of Radio 702, Johannesburg) then read out on theair the passage quoted above from Hugh Lynn Cayce’s biography in which theformer ARE President claims to have been instrumental in obtaining a Fulbrightscholarship for Hawass. Hawass replied: ‘That’s not true. I met him, I lecturedto the Edgar Cayce Foundation many times. He was such a nice man. I neverbelieved his theories. He never supported a fellowship for me to study outsideat all. He just once attended a dinner that I invited him to in Cairo with oneof the Fulbrights ... but he did not support any study. The Egyptian governmentsupported my studies for five years and the Fulbright supported my studies atthe University of Pennsylvania for two years. It had no support from such anorganization like that.’Hawass was then asked about Secret Chamber, the short video referred to abovemade by Boris Said in November and December 1995 and financed by Joseph Schor.The interviewer pointed out that this video makes positive reference to EdgarCayce and his prophecies and includes an appearance by Zahi Hawass in which theEgyptian official stated that a tunnel under the Sphinx is about to be opened.‘How come you’re involved with that?’ asked the interviewer.Hawass: This is not true! I’m a public figure and I get interviews every day!Every day if you come to my office you will see almost three TVs from all overthe world. I ... my interviews always explain my discoveries. This video istalking about the tunnel that I found inside the Sphinx based on my work. It isnot by the work that is done here, it’s by Florida University. It is not byCayce or anything! And we found even that Florida University are not followingthe scientist’s steps therefore I wrote a letter two months ago that those type... even the universities, the universities are not following the exact stepsthat they supposed to do.Interviewer: It seems a coincidence ... it seems a coincidence, Dr. Zahi, thatthe Cayce prophecy talks about tunnels under the Sphinx. You’ve discredited it.You’ve banned various researchers according to The Message of the Sphinx—peoplelike John West who are trying to do work on this theory—and now you seem to betaking it over yourself. Is that true?Hawass: No! I’m not taking over myself.. . If there is evidence, actual evidencefrom an institution, to tell us there is something under the Sphinx we’llexcavate it. But all of it is just hallucination! We cannot run afterhallucinations at all.Interviewer: But in that video, where you are actually filmed in a tunnel underthe Sphinx, you indicated that this might lead to something very, very exciting... I saw that myself, Zahi!Hawass: If I did found ... I told you! I excavated this tunnel. And I didexcavate it and I’m excavating it. If it leads to something important, we’llannounce it. You know what I’m saying? I’m not denying that ... Maybe it willlead to something exciting.The interviewer asked Dr. Hawass why he had not taken legal action against us,the authors of The Message of the Sphinx, ‘because they make some seriousaccusations against you.’ Hawass replied: ‘You know, if I make legal actionagainst them I will make them famous. But I will never, err, make themfamous.’[731] [index_split_036.html#filepos912282]On 15 August 1996, in an interview with the Egyptian Gazette in Cairo, Dr.Hawass made an oddly similar remark concerning the Japanese team from WasedaUniversity, led by Professor Sakuji Yoshimura, who in 1988 had used advancedtechnology to identify a hidden chamber inside the Great Pyramid and anotherbeneath the left forepaw of the Great Sphinx. ‘I believe these teams were notserious enough,’ stated Dr. Hawass, ‘and their equipment was not well tooled.The members of these teams were merely interested in acquiring fame.’[732][index_split_036.html#filepos912418]Mars and Giza:Strange connections and synchronicityIn our research we have stumbled across a tangled web of clues, connections andoverlapping interests appearing to suggest that American scientists with linksto NASA may have quietly involved themselves, since at least the 1970s, incovert ‘expeditions’ to unveil the secrets of the great pyramids and the GreatSphinx of Giza. The story, oddly enough, appears to be running in parallel withresearch stemming from the existence of curious pyramidial structures (and agigantic Sphinx-like ‘Face’) that were photographed on Mars by NASA spacecraftduring the 1970s.In 1971 NASA’s Mariner 9 probe took the first ever photographs of strange‘pyramid’ structures on Mars on a region of the planet known to astronomers asElysium. Dr. James Hurtak, a graduate in remote sensing technology (and anacquaintance of Mark Lehner’s) was one of the earliest researchers to showinterest in the Elysium ‘pyramids’—which were officially dismissed by NASA as‘tricks of light’. In 1975, despite NASA’s apparent indifference, Hurtakpredicted that further finds of similar structures, including a Sphinx-likemonument, would be made on Mars and that they would all prove to be connected ina great cosmic blueprint to the Giza monuments in Egypt.[733][index_split_036.html#filepos912546]Hurtak is an active campaigner against the secrecy of the United States militaryand related agencies with regard to UFO ‘cover-ups’ and other similar issues. Healso claims to have had close links with researchers at California’s prestigiousStanford Research Institute, America’s second largest scientific think-tank(which has an annual budget from the United States government of over threehundred million dollars). The SRI’s projects have included the ‘Remote ViewingProgram’ (started in 1972), funded by the CIA as an intelligence-gatheringexercise, which recruited top psychics to ‘remote view’ enemy militaryinstallations and other sites.In 1973, as we saw in Chapter 5, the Egyptian Antiquities Organization (EAO)granted an official license to the SRI, permitting it to conduct surveys aroundthe Great Sphinx at Giza using ground-penetrating radar and seismographs. Thelocal sponsor of this project was Cairo’s Ain Shams University. We recall thatin the same year Hugh Lynn Cayce sent Mark Lehner to the American University inCairo with funds raised by ARE members.In 1976 a second NASA probe, Viking I, went into Mars orbit. In the region knownas Cydonia it photographed several more pyramidial structures (including thefive-sided ‘D&M Pyramid’) and the famous ‘Face’. Complete with its distinctiveSphinx-like headdress, this latter feature has been calculated from the NASAimages to be 1.6 miles in length from crown to chin, 1.2 miles wide, and justunder 2,600 feet high. NASA has argued officially that it is nothing more than asmall mountain, naturally weathered. But how many mountains have their left andright sides so intricately similar? Image analysts say that the ‘bilateralsymmetry’ of the Face, mimicking a natural, almost human appearance, is mostunlikely to have come about by chance. And this impression is confirmed by othercharacteristics that have subsequently been identified under computerenhancement. These include ‘teeth’ in the mouth, bilaterally crossed lines abovethe eyes, and regular lateral stripes in the headpiece—suggestive, to someresearchers at least, of the nemes headdress of ancient Egyptian pharaohs.[734][index_split_036.html#filepos912792]Back in Egypt in 1977, a year after the Viking images had first reached theEarth, Mark Lehner made contact with NASA’s Dr. Lambert T. Dolphin, leader ofthe Stanford Research Institute project at the Sphinx. The reader will recallfrom Chapter 5 that Lehner was by then already well acquainted with Zahi Hawass.Later in 1977 Lambert Dolphin traveled to Virginia Beach to negotiate fundingfrom the Edgar Cayce organization for a proposed new SRI project at Giza. Thepurpose of this project was to use the latest remote sensing technology tosearch for hidden chambers around and under the Sphinx—with Lehner again‘participating as the Edgar Cayce Foundation’s “man in Cairo”.’ Severalunderground ‘cavities’ were detected by this Sphinx Exploration Project.In 1978 Mark Lehner proposed a project on the Sphinx to the American ResearchCentre in Egypt. The project, again partially financed by the Edgar Cayce group,was approved and went ahead with Lehner as its Field Director. Soon afterwards aUnited States registered company called Recovery Systems International (RSI)appeared on the scene. As we saw in Chapter 5, it undertook core drillings infront of the Sphinx to investigate the promising underground cavities previouslypinpointed by SRI.In 1983 Hugh Lynn Cayce died and the management of the Edgar Cayce group washanded to his son, Charles Thomas Cayce. In the same year ‘The Independent MarsProject’ was set up in the United States by Richard Hoagland, a former NASAconsultant, and Lambert Dolphin. Meanwhile in 1987 Dr. Zahi Hawass completed hiseducation in the United States and returned to Egypt to be appointed as theEAO’s Director-General of the Giza Plateau.In March 1996 Dr. Hawass announced that the Egyptian scientist Farouk El Baz(whose name, meaning Hawk, translates into ancient Egyptian as Horus) had beenchosen to lead a team to open the secret door inside the Great Pyramid at theend of the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber. The reader will recall thatAmtex, the Canadian company participating in the project, claim to be ‘workingwith Spar Aerospace’ to devise a tool to open or ‘go straight through’ the door.Spar Aerospace are better known for manufacturing hydraulic arms used in NASASpace Shuttles. As we noted at the beginning of this appendix, Dr. El Baz, agraduate of Cairo’s Ain Shams university, is a NASA consultant. He has beeninvolved for many years with studies of geological formations on the Moon and onMars and he is a one-time personal friend of astronauts Buzz Aldrin and NeilArmstrong. It was El Baz, nicknamed the King by his NASA colleagues, who in 1969chose the spot for the Apollo 11 Moon landing. El Baz is the founder of theCentre of Remote Sensing at Boston University and presently serves as itsDirector.[735] [index_split_036.html#filepos913008]Also in March 1996 the EAO granted a one-year renewable license for the projectat die Sphinx—see above—financed by Joseph Schor.

Kerisel kindly made this study—Lu Grande Pyramide et ses DerniersSecrets—available to us prior to its publication (due 1996). The basis of hiscalculation is that the pressure on the soil cannot exceed 1.5 tons/sq.m. forramps made of compacted soil (probably covered with stone slabs) with slopes notexceeding 8 per cent. The friction coefficient has been calculated at 15 percent using soaked lime as the lubricant. Kerisel noted that a greater pressurethan 1.5 tons would cause the lubricant to seep away and thus the frictioncoefficient would increase, making hauling even more difficult. The averagespeed has been worked out to be 0.3 metres/second with a 13-kilogram tractionforce produced by each man. Thus the hauling of a 70-ton block would require(70,000 X 0.15 X 1/13=) 807 men and would take some 9.25 hours for a ramp of onekilometre. Kerisel worked out that if the traction was much higher than 13kg/man—even for a short period of time—the result would be serious backinjuries. Thus, assuming at least 1 clear metre distance between each standingman, 807 men in 6 rows would need a ramp space of 134.5 metres long and 6 metreswide. The problem, of course, is greatly increased for blocks of 200 tons withinthe confined working conditions of the Sphinx and Valley Temples—a task almostimpossible to imagine with such primitive techniques.[73] [index_split_012.html#filepos106821] Robert Schoch’s evidence presented inMystery of the Sphinx, op. cit.[74] [index_split_012.html#filepos108106] KMT Vol. V, op. cit., p. 7.[75] [index_split_012.html#filepos110893] The Sacred Sermon (Hermetica, LibellusIII), translated by G.

It is found, for example, in The Book ofSothis (commented upon by the Byzantine historian Georgios Synecellus who livedin the ninth century AD) and which some scholars attribute to the Egyptianscribe, Manetho (See Garth Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes, Princeton UniversityPress, New Jersey 1993, pp. 29-33). The idea is also planted in the Kore Kosmou(Excerpt XXIII of the Hermetic writings) of the first and second century AD (SeeHermetica, op. cit., p. 461). In the Kore Kosmou (section 8) the goddess Isisclaims that Thoth deposited in a secret place the ‘sacred books’ which contained‘the secret things of Osiris ... these holy symbols of the cosmic elements’ andthen cast a spell that these books shall remain ‘unseen and undiscovered by allmen who shall go to and fro on the plains of this land until the time whenHeaven, grown old, shall beget organisms [i.e. humans] worthy of you ...’[134] [index_split_015.html#filepos212398] 2 Andrew Tomas, From Atlantis toDiscovery, Robert Hale, London 1972, p. 109.[135] [index_split_015.html#filepos212927] Ibn Abd Alhokim and the ArabManuscripts of Ibn Khurradhbih and Lohfat, cited by Joseph R.

The term ‘Horizon’, however, couldmean either the Great Pyramid itself or the whole necropolis of Giza, thusincluding the Sphinx. Spell 1080 of the Coffin Texts (c. 2000 BC) speaks of asecret ‘sealed thing’ belonging to Osiris of Rostau (Giza) and spell 1087suggests that it was ‘writing material’ linked to Heliopolis (Djedu, the ‘PillarCity’), and hidden somewhere in the desert sands.[138] [index_split_015.html#filepos213711] These Coptic traditions were recordedby the Arab chroniclers Al Qodai, Al Masudi and Al Maqrizi, cited in Jochmans,The Hall of Records, op. cit., p. 210.[139] [index_split_015.html#filepos214288] The so-called ‘Old Charges’ ofFreemasonry speak of a certain Hermenes (obviously Hermes, i.e. Thoth) whopreserved the ‘crafts’ by carving their knowledge on sacred pillars or obelisks(see Fred L.

It is generally accepted that muchof the ‘Egyptian’ esoteric strain in Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism and, to acertain extent, the Theosophists, comes from the so-called Hermetic Traditionthat developed in Europe in the late Italian Renaissance but drew its sourcefrom the Greek and Coptic texts known as the Hermetic writings (see Frances A.Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, University of Chicago Press,Chicago 1991; also The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, Ark Paperbacks, London 1986,p. 212).[140] [index_split_015.html#filepos217810] Harmon Hartzell Bro, Edgar Cayce: ASeer Out Of Season, Signet Books, New York 1990, pp. 43-4.

Apparently small charcoal samples wereextracted from the ancient mortar in the core’s joints. The results gave a widerange of dates for the Great Pyramid—between 3809 BC to 2853 BC—which is a fewcenturies earlier than the c. 2600 BC date assigned by Egyptologists, but veryfar from the 10,500 BC date given in the Cayce Readings. Although many doubtshave been raised concerning the validity of the results (see Venture Inwardissues May-June 1986 and November-December 1986), this, and other archaeologicalevidence Mark Lehner came across at Giza, appears to have undermined his beliefsin Cayce’s readings.

In his letter to us, op. cit.,p. 5, Lehner elaborated: ‘I am happy that my professional work developed out ofa more personal quest—call it what you will, philosophical, spiritual, ethical.Rather than look only for agreement with notions I had already conceived beforecoming to Giza—that is, what I wanted to be true—I looked for ways to test theseand, later, other ideas about ancient Egyptian cultural development. I found fewresemblances between the physical evidence and Cayce-derived ideas of an earliercivilization at Giza. But I did find the pyramids to be very human monuments.Because there is such an abundance of evidence of real people and an Egyptiansociety building the Sphinx and the Pyramids, it seems culturally chauvinisticto ascribe these monuments to a different, conveniently lost, civilization onthe basis of “revealed” information and ambiguous patterns. My work is stillpart of a lifelong quest for meaning.

The rod still lies there, inside the shaft, at about 8metres from the entrance and runs to the ‘corner’, some 24 metres up the shaft.Gantenbrink could not take his robot round the corner but he managed to see,with the video camera, that it runs for a further two metres or so and thenturns sharply back on track. What lies at the end is still unknown.[233] [index_split_016.html#filepos283929] The Dixons, who were iron structuralcontractors from Newcastle, were building a bridge across the Nile near Cairo.The iron rod they used seems to have been purpose made to probe the shaft. Itwas cut in lengths of approximately 12 feet then assembled together withsleeve-joints as the rod was pushed within the shaft. It seems to have beenstuck at the upper end, forcing the Dixons to abandon it.[234] [index_split_016.html#filepos284800] Nature, 26 December 1872, p. 147.[235] [index_split_016.html#filepos284800] Letter from John Dixon to PiazziSmyth dated 23 November 1872.[236] [index_split_016.html#filepos284800] The Graphic, 7 December 1872, p. 530.Also Nature, 26 December 1872 p. 146.

The shafts were concealed yet, ina curious manner, their position was obvious once a logical correlation was madewith those in the King’s Chamber above—as Waynman Dixon finally did in 1872 (seeI. E. S. Edwards, The Pyramids of Egypt, op. cit., 1982 edition, p. 123). Oncethe openings were found, then natural curiosity would urge a deeper probe intothe shafts.

There are thousands of references to ‘stars’ ‘star-souls’,‘the sun-god’, ‘the sky’, ‘the Milky Way’ etc., that make the Pyramid Textsobvious candidates for a proper astronomical investigation into their contentand hidden meaning. The intense concept of ‘time’—especially the ‘time’ of the‘sky gods’ and of a cosmic ‘Creation’—that is found in these texts stronglysuggests that the science of precession is also an important factor to apply onsuch an esoteric literature.

Lubicz wrote: ‘It is significant also that tradition had already relatedthe heliacal rising of Sirius with the beginning of the Nile’s flooding and withthe constellation of Leo; indeed since the foundation of the calendar to thebeginning of our era, in Egypt the sun was always situated in the constellationof Leo at the date of the heliacal rising of Leo’ (Sacred Science, op. cit., p.176). The tradition which Schwaller is alluding to is also confirmed by severalGreek and Roman chroniclers who passed through Egypt in ancient times.Harpollon, for example, who visited Egypt in the fifth century, commented that:‘Lions were a symbol of the inundation in consequence of the Nile rising moreabundantly when the sun was in Leo. Those who anciently presided over sacredworks made the waterspouts and passages of fountains in the form of lions ...’(Harpollon Book I, 21). The same is stated by Plutarch, who came to Egypt in thefirst century AD. Plutarch is distinguished for being the only scholar inantiquity to have compiled a full coherent account of the Osiris and Isis myth.He held a high position as a magistrate in Boeotia and also belonged to thepriesthood of Delphi. In about AD 50 he compiled his celebrated De hide etOsiride (On his and Osiris) after consulting Egyptian priests in Egypt, who alsotold him of the astral rituals of the summer solstice: ‘Of the stars, theEgyptians think that Sirius, the Dog Star, is the star of Isis, because it isthe bringer of water [i.e. the Nile’s flood]. They also hold the lion in honour,and they adorn the doorways of their shrines with gaping lions’ heads, becausethe Nile overflows “when for the first time the Sun comes in conjunction with[the constellation] of Leo” ...’ (see quote in R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, SacredScience, op. cit., p. 91).[438] [index_split_021.html#filepos428063] Richard H. Allen, Star Names: TheirLore and Meaning, Dover Publications Inc., New York, 1963, pp. 255-6. It is thebrightest star in Leo, a constellation known as the ‘Domicilium Solis’ (‘Houseof the Sun’). Allen makes this curious comment but gives no reference: ‘Thegreat androsphinx [of Giza] is said to have been sculptured with Leo’s body andthe head of the adjacent Virgo ...’ (ibid., p. 253).[439] [index_split_021.html#filepos429783] Memphis.[440] [index_split_021.html#filepos429783] For a full discussion on the ‘solarboats’ see Selim Hassan, Excavations at Giza, op. cit., pp. 1-156.

Emery,Archaic Egypt, op. cit, p. 42ff.[577] [index_split_026.html#filepos535587] Even his name is put into doubt.According to Dr. Jaromir Malek, for example, the name of Menes ‘could becompletely fictitious and based on a word-play which was misunderstood as aroyal name by the later compilers of king-lists’ (Jaromir Malek, In the Shadowof the Pyramids, Orbis, London, 1986, p. 29). As for his other name, Narmer,this, too, is plagued with confusion and doubt. On the so-called votivemace-heads and palettes found at Hierakonpolis there is shown the image of achieftain or ‘king’ and on the front of his face are shown certain hieroglyphicsigns, in some cases forming the syllables ‘Nar-Mer’ and in others showing ascorpion. This has led Egyptologists to conclude that the Menes of theking-lists is this Narmer or ‘King Scorpion’ (ibid., pp. 28-9). To overcome theobvious confusion of having this presumed ‘last king of Predynastic Egypt’bearing three names, Egyptologists have arrived at the unsatisfactory conclusionthat the name ‘King Scorpion’ on the votive mace-head ‘is almost certainlywrong’ and that it must be regarded as some sort of ‘large ceremonial image’.Consequently ‘if King “Scorpion” is thus refuted,’ proposed Dr. Malek, then ‘thelikeliest candidate for identification with the figure on the mace-head isNarmer’ (ibid., p. 29).[578] [index_split_026.html#filepos535587] W.

This led her to make precessional calculations whichbracketed the ‘Golden Age’ between 7300 BC and 6700 BC, the two epochs markingthe beginning and end of Orion’s heliacal rising with the spring equinox (e.g.pp. 28 and 43). Although the core of her thesis that the key to the ancientmystery is to be found in the tracking of Orion’s precessional drift is spot on,her conclusion that the measurements are to be made at the rising in the east ofOrion at the spring equinox is a curious error of judgement. For what is mostsurprising about Sellers’s analytical approach is that, while she correctly putsall the emphasis of her thesis on Orion and its precessional drift, she makesabsolutely no reference to the most obvious astronomical ‘Orion marker’ inancient Egypt: the ‘Orion’ star-shaft in the Great Pyramid. Indeed, Sellerscompletely ignores the Pyramids or any other structure in Egypt, and insteadcentres her attention only on the textual material. The fact is that the Pyramidbuilders and the compilers of the Pyramid Texts were not tracking Orion in theeastern horizon but high in the southern skies, at the meridian.[587] [index_split_026.html#filepos541550] Precessional calculations show thatwe live in the astronomical ‘Last Time’ of Orion, with the belt stars in ourepoch approaching the highest altitude at the meridian that they will everattain in their precessional cycle.[588] [index_split_026.html#filepos542811] Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha vonDechend, Hamlet’s Mill, op. cit., p. 11.[589] [index_split_027.html#filepos545161] Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient EgyptianLiterature, Vol. I: The Old and Middle Kingdoms, p. 52.[590] [index_split_027.html#filepos545735] Ibid., pp. 52-3.[591] [index_split_027.html#filepos547565] Pyramid Texts, op. cit., lines1256-7, p. 200.[592] [index_split_027.html#filepos548958] Ibid., 1278, p. 202.[593] [index_split_027.html#filepos549236] For a brief review see Bunson, TheEncyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt, op. cit., p. 130.[594] [index_split_027.html#filepos549236] Ibid.[595] [index_split_027.html#filepos550527] Pyramid Texts, op. cit., 1657, p.247.[596] [index_split_027.html#filepos550734] Ibid., Utterance 610, p. 253.[597] [index_split_027.html#filepos550974] Ibid., lines 2180-1, p. 305.[598] [index_split_027.html#filepos551110] Ibid., lines 882-3, p. 155.[599] [index_split_027.html#filepos551426] Sellers, Death of Gods, op. cit., pp.90-3.[600] [index_split_027.html#filepos551426] Selim Hassan, Excavations at Giza,op. cit., pp. 194ff.[601] [index_split_027.html#filepos552296] Pap.

Egyptologists accept, however that these textsare themselves transcripts (or translations?) of even earlier texts that are nowlost to history, and that the scribes who initially wrote them down in Egyptianhieroglyphs often did not understand the words they were copying. According toE. A. Wallis Budge, for example: ‘Several passages bear evidence that thescribes—who drafted the copies from which the cutters of the inscriptions workeddid not understand what they were writing ... The general impression is that thepriests who drafted the copies made extracts from several compositions ofdifferent ages and having different contents ...’ In consequence, Budgeconcludes: ‘The Pyramid Texts are full of difficulties of every kind. The exactmeanings of a large number of words found in them are unknown ... theconstruction of the sentence often baffles all attempts to translate it, andwhen it contains wholly unknown words it becomes an unsolved riddle.’ See E.

Proclus’s ideas formed the basis of the nineteenth-century astronomerRichard Proctor’s thesis, The Great Pyramid: Observatory, Tomb and Temple(published by Chatto & Windus, London, 1883), who argued that the Grand Gallerywas used as a sighting device for the stars.[633] [index_split_028.html#filepos587750] James Bonwick, Pyramids: Facts andFancies, Kegan Paul, 1877, p. 169.[634] [index_split_028.html#filepos588639] William R.

For 13,000 years this would give 4.36 degrees of motion.But the motion is oblique to the meridian, giving some 3 degrees decrease indeclination.[652] [index_split_029.html#filepos613544] Calculations using the rigorousformula for precession corrected for nutation, aberration of starlight, propermotion (from the most recent Yale Bright Star Catalogue) and parallax was doneby astronomer Adrian Ashford in August 1995. In circa 11,850 BC Sirius wouldtheoretically be at the lowest point in its cycle, with a declination of -60degrees, thus just on the south horizon. In 10,500 BC it would have had adeclination of nearly -59 degrees, thus shining brightly approximately 1 degreeover the south horizon as seen from Giza.[653] [index_split_029.html#filepos614761] Ibid.[654] [index_split_029.html#filepos614761] See Part II of the present work for adiscussion.[655] [index_split_029.html#filepos615680] Herodotus, The History, op. cit.,II:124, p. 185.

Although the bearing of theKhafre causeway at 14 degrees south of east is not in dispute, there has beensome disagreement amongst scholars over the direction of the Khufu causeway—mosttraces of which have been long ago obliterated. Some authorities believe itproceeded straight on the 14-degree bearing it takes from the Mortuary Temple ofthe Great Pyramid, others believe that it started with this bearing and thenchanged direction, before reaching the Valley Temple of the Great Pyramid. Togive some indication of the range of opinion on this matter see George Goyon, LeSecret des Batisseurs des Grandes Pyramides: Kheops, Pygmalion, Gerard Watelet,Paris, 1990, p. 140: ‘contrary to what some have long believed, the direction[of the Khufu causeway] stays uniform and does not change direction in thevalley below.’ Zahi Hawass in The Pyramids of Ancient Egypt, The Carnegie Serieson Egypt, Pennsylvania, 1990, p. 22, also shows a straight causeway on the14-degree bearing, but points out on page 18: ‘scholars disagree over the exactcourse of the causeway, but it led to Khufu’s Valley Temple, the ruins of whichlie under the present-day village of Nazlet-el-Sammam.’[660] [index_split_029.html#filepos620243] John Legon, The Giza Ground Plan, op.cit., p. 60.[661] [index_split_029.html#filepos622500] For a general discussion, see RichardHeinberg, Celebrate the Solstice, Quest Books, Wheaton, 111, 1993, pp. 11-14.[662] [index_split_029.html#filepos625422] We note with interest that this‘cross-quarter’ alignment appears to have been of major importance atHeliopolis. In The Dawn of Astronomy, op. cit., p. 77, the British astronomer J.Norman Lockyer, who was able to survey the site of ancient Heliopolis before itwas obscured by the modern suburb that now covers it, noted in passing that theprincipal mound on the site had a bearing of 14 degrees south of east—i.e. theidentical bearing to the Khafre causeway. Lockyer also reminds us of ancientEgyptian traditions that Heliopolis was founded by the Shemsu Hor, the‘Followers of Horus’, long before the beginning of Dynastic history (ibid., p.74).[663] [index_split_029.html#filepos628912] Pyramid Texts, op. cit., Utterances471-3, pp. 160-2.[664] [index_split_029.html#filepos631467] Coffin Texts, op. cit., Spell 1080,Vol. III, p. 147.[665] [index_split_030.html#filepos637830] From the Eleventh Division of theDuat, ‘The Book of What is in the Duat’, E.

However, the supernova wasabout 5500 light-years away and its light only started reaching our planet in c.AD 1000. It was recorded by the Chinese and, apparently, by the North AmericanIndians. No one seems to have recorded it in Europe or the Middle East, which isvery odd, since Christians, at that time, fervently awaited a ‘sign’ from heavento announce the ‘Second Coming’ of Christ.[678] [index_split_031.html#filepos651734] The Orion Mystery, op. cit., p. 200.See also Robert G.

An interesting articletouching upon this idea can be read in Steuart Campbell, ‘The Origin and Purposeof the Pyramids’ in the New Humanist, December 1990 issue, pp. 3-4, who wrotethat ‘the Great Pyramid might have been intended as a dwelling place for thespirit of Osiris’. The French Antiquarian and Freemason, Alexandre Lenoir (see‘A dissertation on the Pyramids of Egypt’ in FMR No. 39, 1989) was also to claimthat ‘all considered it [the Great Pyramid] may be the tomb of Osiris’.[687] [index_split_031.html#filepos660259] E.

See Chapter 3 of the present work.[694] [index_split_031.html#filepos663385] This pertinent point was raised veryrecently by the eminent astronomer, Dr. Mary Bruck: ‘Can the Great Pyramid beastronomically dated?’ in The Journal of the British Astronomical Society, 105, 4, 1995, pp. 161-4.[695] [index_split_031.html#filepos664802] 25 See J.

See RobinCook, ‘The stellar geometry of the Great Pyramid’ in Discussions in Egyptology29, 1994, pp. 29-36. Rudolf Gantenbrink, who remeasured the angles of the shaftsrecently, gave a higher ‘adjusted’ value of 39.6 degrees for the southern shaftof the Queen’s Chamber. None the less, the ‘designed’ intention to have theshafts come out at the same level very much seems to be the case for the GreatPyramid.[696] [index_split_031.html#filepos665892] The Orion Mystery, op. cit., pp.222-3.[697] [index_split_031.html#filepos666511] Ibid., p. 34.[698] [index_split_031.html#filepos667948] Hence the ‘Fish’ symbol amongst theearly Christians, denoting the ‘new age’ of Christianity marked by the vernalequinox in Pisces. The vernal point is now poised to enter the new age ofAquarius.[699] [index_split_031.html#filepos668391] When Alexander the Great liberatedEgypt from Persian rule, he was hailed by the Egyptian priests as a divine heroand the returned ‘son of Ammon’—and by his Macedonian followers as ‘son ofZeus’. Both titles stand, of course, for ‘son of god’. After his death a ‘cultof Alexander’ was established in Alexandria which spread with almost messianicfervour across the Fertile Crescent. For the three centuries preluding theChristian era, Alexander (who had died at the age of thirty-three in 323 BC) wasthe archetype of the conquering martyred ‘hero-king’ and ‘son of god’ ofquasi-solar pedigree who had unified the known world on the basis of a divineblueprint or mission. It was thus that, in the closing years of the last centuryBC, the whole Roman world, sickened by the endless civil and foreign wars,placed much hope for the return of a ‘saviour-king’ modelled on Alexander whowould unite the empire and usher in a new golden age. This hope was very muchpinned on Augustus Caesar (Octavian) by the Roman poet Virgil in c. 42 BC in hisfamous Eclogues (‘see how Olympian Caesar’s star has climbed the sky, the starto gladden all our corn with grain ... your children’s children will enjoy thefruits ...’). In 12 BC Augustus Caesar was declared head of the Roman (thus‘world’) religion and given the title of Pontifex Maximus—a title later todenote the Catholic pontiffs or ‘Popes’ of Rome. Ironically, in 4 BC—the assumedyear that Christ was born—Augustus adopted Tiberius (second Emperor of Rome whoruled from AD 14 to AD 37, thus in the ministry of Jesus) and declared him hisheir. Yet by the most unexpected twist of fate Virgil’s prophecy was eventuallyto be fulfilled not by ‘Divine Augustus’ but by a Jewish ‘saviour-king’, theChristos or Christ, fostered four centuries later by Rome itself under the ruleof Constantine the Great (see Ian Wilson, Jesus, the Evidence, Pan Books,London, 1984, pp. 134-44). It may well be that Virgil’s ‘star of Caesar’influenced the unknown author of the gospel of Matthew (‘We have seen his starand come to pay him homage ...’ Matthew 2:1-9) who used the astral prophesy forthe birth of Jesus. Not unexpectedly, many of the great Italian Hermeticphilosophers of the late Renaissance (Bruno, Pico della Mirandola, Campanella,etc.) often presented Virgil as a ‘Gentile prophet’ of Christianity and the‘Egyptian’ Hermes Trismegistos (i.e. the Egyptian god Thoth) in par with the OldTestament prophet Moses (see Frances A. Yates, Giordano Bruno, op. cit.). Manyof these Hermetic ‘Cabala’ philosophers adamantly believed that the ‘Egyptian’astral magic as found in the ancient texts was the agency or ‘device’ for greatworld-changing events (ibid, et al.). It can be thus argued that in the firstcentury of our era the scene was set in the collective subconscious byastrologer-prophets of old to bring about a messianic event. In our next book,we will explore how such powerful ‘Hermetic devices’ were activated throughoutthe ages and also, as the case may be, may be about to be galvanized in presenttimes.[700] [index_split_031.html#filepos669982] Richard H.
