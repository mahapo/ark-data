And lastly I would like to acknowledge author and researcher GrahamHancock, whose approach, insights, and body of work continue to lay thefoundation on which so many of us try to build in the pursuits of our particularpassions. Without Graham, all these articles, which he commissioned for onlinediscussion, would not exist."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONGLENN KREISBERGIn bringing together this collection of articles, building on and complementingthe previous volume, Lost Knowledge of the Ancients, I looked beyond thesensational, beyond the 2012 prophecies and neo–New Age phenomenon that haspeaked since the millennium. Instead, we have not a wild journey of unbridledspeculation but one of careful study, analysis, and contemplation of evidence,using common sense sometimes combined with uncommon intuition. The researcherspresented come from many different walks of life, a wide range of backgrounds,and various regions of the globe, yet all share a common drive and life passionin their fields of endeavor.According to G. I. Gurdjieff, one of the world’s great spiritual teachers, therewas, or is, a secret school or brotherhood (or monastery) that existed inAfghanistan for thousands of years called the Sarmoun Darq. The name of theschool translates roughly to “beehive” or “collectors of honey.” Gurdjieff issaid to have searched the world for many years to find the source of esotericteaching and to have finally found what he was looking for in the Sarmoun Darq.The school existed to gather up and preserve certain kinds of ancient knowledgeregarding the human soul, and it is said many other such schools once existedwith a similar purpose. In times when such knowledge was known to bedissipating, these schools served a most important purpose, for without thepreservation of this knowledge and its continued reintegration into the humanspirit, we would cease to evolve.Stored, sacred knowledge exists around the world today, and those who collectand store these esoteric principles do so in a way not unlike how bees collectnectar; they concentrate and change the nectars so that when the proper timearrives, the receptacles can be reopened and the knowledge accessed. Seekers oftruth and those souls who are deeply curious and find the knowledge, hiddentherein, will then inform others and thereby be of value to humanity.In the process, new bodies of work are created by great teachers seeking torevise old rituals and meditation techniques and bring new meaning to theseancient beliefs. Deep understandings of esoteric secrets are reconfigured andrevealed in new forms. Traditions and methods are borrowed and exchanged betweenone another. Truths that were once obvious but are now obscured awaitrediscovery and are revealed. We are in such a time now.Our very salvation may depend on rediscovering these truths about our world andourselves. The irony of this age, going back over six hundred years and comingnearly full circle in the present, is how the faiths of Western civilizationhave sent out missionaries to save and educate the “savage” tribes and culturesof the world—tribes and cultures that for thousands of years have developedhighly sophisticated belief systems based in the shamanic tradition, a traditionof experiential practice of communing with spirit that’s anything but “faithbased.” And now, through the study of these ancient indigenous practices andshamanic belief systems and their assimilation into our modern lives andculture, we may find the path to a secure and sustainable future, if we’re tohave any future at all.We must pay attention to the profound messages in the scriptures from everyancient culture that have been handed down through the ages, messages that nowoffer cures to the curse of modern life. Cures for the disconnection from natureand cures that offer a true path to a higher human consciousness—the path to anew golden age.While most of the articles are on this topic, a few have nothing to do withseeking a spiritual path and simply deal with mysteries of the ancient past.However, if we consider a wider context for these articles—that they all shareat their heart a search for a deeper truth to the meaning and workings of lifeand our place in the multiverse—then we notice a reality common to the humancondition, that of always thirsting and striving for more and more knowledge.This was the psychology of the ancient mind-set, and it is the common threadthat weaves its way through all the written works in this book."},{"pageContent":"O N EWELCOME TO THE REVOLUTIONTHE RESURGENCE OF ELEMENTAL SHAMANISM IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURYOMAR RO SALESAcross the planet, from the steppes of the Himalayas to the deepest jungles ofGuatemala, a renewed emphasis on ecology, cultural preservation, andspirituality has led to an increased awareness of shamanism as a method toaddress environmental, humanistic, and intrapersonal challenges. With a shift toindigenous healing traditions and a return to old ways of thought, shamans arerapidly becoming the cultural heroes that bridge the gap between the mysticalregions of the upper, middle, and lower worlds, as well as the enigmatic andethereal realms of the collective unconscious, conscious, and superconsciousmind of humanity.THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PLASTIC SHAMANSIn the latter half of the twentieth century, a renewed interest in spirituality,politics, and the occult led many on explorative intrapersonal journeys. Fueledby the counterculture influence of the 1960s, icons such as Timothy Leary,Carlos Castaneda, Jim Morrison, and Hunter S. Thompson glamorized the quest forimmortal truth, as defined by native indigenous healers or shamans. Yet, thetruth would come at a great cost, as facts were oftentimes distorted or entireaccounts of ethnographies fabricated. In fact, some of the most importantfieldwork in anthropology had been done forty years before by BronisławMalinowski, Richard Schultes, and other scholars that few would know outsideuniversity circles.¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3079_0]Through research, it was determined that entire accounts of indigenous spiritualand healing traditions, popularized during the 1960s, had been fabricated.Although many continue to quote Don Juan’s shamanic insight, the Yaqui shamanDon Juan never existed, except in the mind of Carlos Castaneda.²[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3081_0] Popular literature in the 1990s continued theWestern imagining of how shamans think, pray, and work. There was no walkaboutin Australia that yielded a mutant message from Down Under, nor is there asisterhood of the shields that provides shamanic knowledge.³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3083_0] The Western fables continue to this day, withinterpretations of 2012 in the Mayan calendar written by self-professedinternational Mayan elders who are Caucasian and born in Michigan.⁴[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3085_0]With regard to December 21, 2012, in the Mayan calendar, the most importantquestion to ask is, “What is the indigenous Mayan population doing to preparefor 2012?” Do we see villages in the Peten Jungle being razed and moved to saferand higher elevations by Mayan elders? Are entire ethnic subgroups of the Maya,such as the Tz’utujil of Lake Atitlán, selling their worldly possessions andmoving to isolated islands in Micronesia? Of course not. The most importantaspect of the calendar round, which sensationalist books fail to mention, isthat the Mayan calendar never ends. Which brings us back to the wolfsbane of theplastic shamans, that there is no substitute for anthropological research andfieldwork.So, where do we find out about shamans? What is a shaman? What abilities doshamanic practitioners master? Moreover, do any real shamans still exist? Theanswer is, once again, in the field.A RETURN TO SCHOLARSHIPThrough the meticulous fieldwork and studies of Franz Boas, Michael Harner,Martin Prechtel, and Wade Davis, the shared characteristics between shamans ofvarious cultures have been identified.Shamans are not like you or me. A shaman is a native healer, who uses plants andherbs to effectuate change in patients. Moreover, a shaman has the ability toenter altered states of consciousness at will, interact with beings innonordinary realms, and create physical changes in waking reality.⁵[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3087_0] A shaman can change her or his energy field tointeract with the energy fields of other living objects. Perhaps the mostimportant part of a shaman is that the shaman is typically indigenous. That is,they are transmitting centuries-old cultural knowledge through bloodlines andkinship. Without this bloodline, without this legitimacy of sang real (the holyblood, the effervescent teacher) and the enhanced genetic traits from thisbloodline, a practitioner is not a true shaman.One of the most significant roles of the shaman is that of psychopomp.⁶[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3089_0] A psychopomp is an intermediary between theworld of the living and the land of the dead. The psychopomp will transmitmessages, share insight, communicate thoughts, and offer warnings from the landof spirit. Communication occurs through dreams, altered states, and rituals,which allow the shaman to enter a receptive state. The shaman will receive themessage either as a symbol or an auditory message to be passed on to theintended receiver.⁷ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3091_0]Another shamanic ability is divination. Through the use of tools such as bones,cards, entrails, sticks, or runes, a shaman will augur the future. The abilityto communicate through dreams is another shamanic skill, used by shamans to relymessages over great distances. Some of the more esoteric shamanic abilities,demonstrated by shamanic masters of the last two thousand years, include locotempestas (the ability to control the weather), bilocation, levitation, andflight.⁸ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3093_0]Yet, how do we find true shamans in the modern age? How do we discern thetheatrical from the real, the plastic from the authentic? And what is the truthto shamanism and the limits of human potential?It was a search for these truths that led me on a worldwide quest to find thereal among the landscape of illusion. It was this search that brought me to theelemental shamans.CHEROKEE SPIRIT WALKER: EXPERT IN SOUL RETRIEVALIn the Valley of the Sun, at the bottom of an ancient ocean, I had my firstencounter with soul retrieval and a Cherokee spirit walker. The son of aCherokee medicine man, Gary Gent is a Vietnam veteran with an unassuming natureand an important skill, the ability to transverse worlds.Soul retrieval is the ability of a shaman to heal the psychological traumacaused by cognitive disassociation.⁹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3095_0] Shamansbelieve that our soul is made up of individual pieces. During periods of greatstress, fear, or difficulty, soul pieces will fragment and become stuck orattached to a particular place or person.¹⁰ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3097_0]The accompanying psychological effects may include memory loss, unexplainednervousness, and a feeling of disconnection or isolation. It’s the role of theshaman to travel to the upper, middle, and lower worlds to obtain informationabout the soul piece and return it to its owner.Gent follows this traditional method of soul retrieval, but with a twist. Usinga drum as a sonic driver, he can enter an altered state within minutes andretrieve a soul piece. Gent travels to the lower world to obtain guidance fromanimal and plant guides. Having obtained the guidance of spirits from the lowerrealm, the Cherokee spirit walker will then travel to the middle world to locatethe fragmented soul piece. Once found, the reintegration will begin as the soulpiece is returned to the owner. Travel to the upper realms is used forrevelation and guidance from gods, deities, and beings of legend.When the soul piece is found and healed, the shaman uses his breath to blow thepiece back into the patient. What is unique about Gent is his uncanny ability todescribe where the fragmentation occurred and where the soul piece was found.With regard to my own experience, Gent was able to accurately describe a collegedorm room, a military barracks, and a grandparent’s home, all without priorknowledge of these locations.So, how exactly does the Cherokee spirit walker break linear time and glimpseinto the patient’s past? A more enigmatic question remains: What if the upper,middle, and lower worlds do not exist at all, but are just a method for Gent’sconsciousness to describe his mind’s ability to use quantum mechanics and breaklinear time?MYSTERIES IN GUATEMALA: THE CULT OF THE MAXIMONFor over fifteen hundred years, shamans in Mayan communities along the CentralHighlands, coastal areas, and Peten Jungle region of Guatemala and Mexico havepredicted eclipses, created calendars, tracked the movements of Venus, andforecast periods of symbolic creation called baktuns. The end of the currentcycle of creation, the thirteen baktun, falls on December 21, or December 23, of2012 (depending on the Greenwich mean time correlation interpretation of theMayan calendar).¹¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3099_0] So, will the end date ofthe current cycle usher a period of cataclysms, disease, and catastrophe? Orwill life remain the same, relatively unchanged from one day to the next? Moreimportantly, what do the Maya think?If there were ever a city of shamans, it would be Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala.Nestled on the north shores of Lake Atitlán, the grittiness and squalor of thecity is hidden by lush volcanoes. Navigating the ferry or lancha on thethirty-minute trip from Panajachel to Santiago, the boat master must steer pasta cove to uncover the bizarre magnificence of the city. Homes are incoherentlystacked one upon another, like matchboxes organized by drunken hands. Firesburning grass, timber, and tires spin their smoke streams into hazy skies.Landing in Santiago, a traveler’s first instinct is clear: get out.Yet secret brotherhoods called cofradias maintain a relative peace in the cityand the countryside. Old village families have evolved to control the worshipand access to the effigy and saint of the region, the Maximon. It is this lordof the lake, this holy boy, the Maximon (pronounced Mosh-ee-moan) that bestowsfavors, offers protection, seeks vengeance against enemies, and guards theindigenous Tz’utujil Mayan populace.More than just a bundle of sticks, the Maximon represents triumph over tyranny,success over slaughter. The effigy is the last living Mayan god, the onlysurvivor of the cosmological onslaught of the Catholic Church and the Spanishconquest. Worship of the deity is tolerated due to a tenuous understanding withthe local Catholic priests. The Maximon is always displayed next to a glasscoffin containing a statue of Christ. And the Maximon is identified as the sonof Christ.But these interpretations are wrong, as the Maximon is an amalgamation of Mayannature spirits. The Maximon has the flying ability of Kukulkan, the Mayan god ofwind. The statue has the ability to bring rain, like the Mayan god Chac. And theeffigy can conquer disease, like Cit-Bolon-Tum, the Mayan god of healing. Somelegends continue the syncretism fable, saying that Maximon is Saint Simon, asaint petitioned to provide help for clandestine activities, such as traffickingnarcotics and avoiding the law. However, this is also incorrect as there is noSaint Simon in Catholic theology.Crafted by native hands, the Maximon is said to be carved from a palo de pito,or coral tree (Erythrina corallodendron). Looking for a suitable vessel for theMayan deity, two brothers began the search for a tree. The brothers, Juan andDavid Co, were led by dreams and came upon an enigmatic tree in the midst of ajungle clearing. In the flesh of the tree, on the bark amid gnarls and limbs,the brothers began to see the symbols of the Maya: a stalk of corn, a bird, ajaguar, and a two-headed eagle—the symbol of Mayan kings.Carving long into the night, the brothers infused the now-fallen tree with thenature spirits from the forest and the DNA-infused sweat from their brows. Itwas the brother’s DNA that gave life and character to the effigy. It wasshamans’ hands that created their supreme ruler and last Mayan lord. Yet, it wasthe spirit in the brothers’ hearts that held a secret. Once finished, one of thebrothers would become the effigy’s standard-bearer or telinel. The telinel wouldbe responsible for the upkeep and care of the statue. The telinel would be thevillage’s first shaman, with the ability to communicate to the statue of theMaximon via dreams.A series of events would necessitate the first surgery and maiming of theMaximon. The statue was infused with the trickster spirit in nature and in thebrothers’ hearts, but what’s funny for the trickster is not always funny to therecipient of the trick: The Maximon was caught shape-shifting and visiting thebeds of the villagers’ wives. As a consequence, the telinel hatched a plan. Thevillage elders got the statue drunk with alcohol and prayer, and then performeda ceremony and, more importantly, an amputation. This is why the modern statuehas no feet, is restrained by rope, and is missing a finger. Thus the effigywould never again be mistaken for a human male. And now the statue is foreverrestrained, to carry out the will of the shamans.The brotherhoods, or cofradias, manage the upkeep of the statue. With over tencofradias in Santiago Atitlán, the statue is moved from family center to familycenter every year, to maintain a tenuous balance of power between rivalcofradias and families. Whoever has control of the statue has access to thethousands of dollars given in tribute every year to the Maximon. Every shamanicceremony around Lake Atitlán must first be approved by the telinel. Without theblessing of the Maximon, and the approval of the telinel, the Mayan shamanicrituals are destined to fail. This is the belief of the local populace, a strongenough belief that can sometimes distort the supernatural nature ofspellcasting.The power to perform magic rests with the practitioner—the shaman. And the toolthe shaman uses to break linear time and apply quantum physics is the shaman’sown mind and consciousness. The power rests with an individual’s beliefs, andthe additional electrical and quantum energy generated by the human brain andspinal cord. Still, the Maximon is worshipped and revered all over CentralAmerica. So, what other secrets do the Tz’utujil Maya of Santiago Atitlán know?GHOSTS IN THE AIR REALM: FOOTPATHS TO HIMALAYAN GLORYAnother breed of shamanic practitioners not typically discussed are theVajrayana Buddhist masters of Tibet and Bhutan. Bon shamanism predated Buddhismin these mountainous and isolated regions of India, Bhutan, and Tibet. Theintroduction of Buddhism supplanted the beliefs and acceptance of Bon. Yet themost evolved and mystical type of Buddhism, known as Vajrayana, returned to theregional Bon roots. Typified by the recognition of adepts with supernaturalpowers such as loco tempestas, bilocation, and levitation, the Vajrayana mastersuse esoteric texts, long periods of chanting and meditation, and secret ritualsto refine their concepts of consciousness.The hallmark of a Vajrayana Buddhist master is the ability to achievetranscendence, break the cycle of karma, and become a bodhisattva, or saint, inone lifetime. Legends tell that the most powerful Buddhist magicians of our agewere also Vajrayana adepts. Examples of these healer-magicians includePadmasambhava, also known as Guru Rinpoche, who brought Buddhism to Bhutan fromSwat; Milarepa who destroyed an entire village with magic, yet after his remorseand upon his realization, changed his life and became a Buddhist teacher andhealer; and Pema Lingpa, a magician from Bhutan, who leapt into a deep rivergorge and emerged from the water holding lighted lamps and sacred Buddhisttreasures called tertöns.Yet the most startling contradiction along a Vajrayana Buddhist master’s pathwayis the dissolution of self and ego and the ultimate realization that individualsouls do not exist, that power comes from the universe, and that the clear lightof the Buddha mind forms a conscious connection with the thoughts and feelingsof all living beings. The final realization, the ultimate insight for aVajrayana Buddhist master, is that we are one. The final answer is that there isno self, but the All.¹² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3101_0]DON’T IGNORE THE HYDRAThe major concepts of modern theoretical physics are refined every two decades.Old science is cut down and gives way to a new head or school of thought. Thirtyyears ago, concepts such as string theory, time travel, and instantaneousmovement between points of space hundreds of thousands of light years apartwould have been science fiction. But new research into the folding ofspace-time, movement through a circular universe, and D-branes, has madetheoretical science plausible. But haven’t shamans been doing this research formillennia?When we talk about divination and clairvoyance, doesn’t a shaman’s altered stateof consciousness allow his mind to break the linear time of athree-dimensional-plus-time universe? When we examine the fabric and weavings ofthe Tz’utujil Maya of Santiago Atitlán and determine that they perceive theuniverse as a geometric pattern that can be folded to an infinitely small pointsuitable for instantaneous journeys between solar systems, aren’t we describingwormholes and faster-than-light travel? When a Buddhist master says the thoughtsof all sentient beings are connected by Buddha mind, aren’t we describing stringtheory and the convocation of D-branes, black p-branes, and Neveu-Schwarzfive-branes?¹³ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3103_0]The shamanic world is the world of quantum physics. Yet, are we adaptingshamanism and indigenous beliefs to explain science? Or is science evolving tothe point where it can explain and quantify indigenous shamanic beliefs? Withscience, the improbable becomes possible. So, what new breakthroughs will we seein the twenty-first century? And how will shamans continue to teach us?THE ELEMENTAL SHAMANSIndigenous elemental shamans and healers can give us modern and true answers,which counter the fictionalized accounts penned by unreliable authors. Bymeticulous research, we determine that there is no need for culturalmisappropriation or theft of Native insight. There is no necessity to make upaccounts. To learn, all we must do is ask. To discover, we must explore. But theessence will always come back to fieldwork.There is no substitute for spending time in the jungle. There is no facsimile tovisiting Buddhist temples and monasteries in the Himalayas. And there is no fauxjourney that will substitute for the insight and transdimensional knowledge(predicted by string theory) that is gained by the consumption of the vine ofthe souls, ayahuasca, as distilled by the hands of Peruvian shamans.¹⁴[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3105_0]If we desire arcane knowledge, ask. If we want to learn about native traditions,journey. Travel to these indigenous healers and ask questions. Ultimately, thejourney for shamanic knowledge is the quest to understand culture, explore thequantum potential of the human body, and demystify the consciousness of thehuman machine.Evolution is within us, the power is within us, to change our world. It’s in thepalm of our hands. It’s found in the beauty of our speech and thought. Theevolution of humanity is determined by the neuroplasticity of our brains,perhaps even already preencoded in our DNA.¹⁵ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3107_0]But shamans have already been teaching us these profound and holy truths forthousands and thousands of years."},{"pageContent":"T W OHIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS EXPLAINS MANY MYSTERIES OF THE ANCIENT PASTJOSEPH SELBIE AND DAVID STEINMETZThere are many intriguing examples of anomalous knowledge that existed in theancient past: verified knowledge of anatomy and physiology and modernlikemedical treatments in use as early as 2500 BCE in Egypt, China, and India; theprecision construction of the Great Pyramid in 2600 BCE (or perhaps earlier);and accurate knowledge of math and physics, including the size and nature of theatom, embedded in India’s Vedas dating back to the sixth millennium BCE—just toname a few.The field of alternative history has long sought the answer to where thisadvanced knowledge came from—and why it didn’t survive. One theory, familiar tomost of us, is that aliens came to Earth in the distant past and gave knowledgeto humanity that was beyond the comprehension of human beings. As the theorygoes, when the aliens eventually left, the knowledge quickly died out becausehumanity wasn’t yet ready for it.Another theory, sometimes put forward by apologists for mainstream archaeology,is that advanced knowledge may have existed in the ancient past but it was dueonly to chance combinations of primitive technology and individualgenius—serendipitous discovery. As the theory goes, when that particular geniusor serendipitous circumstance was gone, the knowledge quickly died out becausehumanity wasn’t yet ready for it.There is, however, another explanation for advanced knowledge in the past—onethat comes to us from the ancient past itself and does not rely on aliens orserendipity. The explanation is that human beings had more advancedconsciousness in the past than they now possess and that it was this advancedconsciousness, natural to humans, that enabled them to develop advancedknowledge on their own without the need for alien intervention or serendipity.Common to this explanation as it comes to us from the ancient past is the notionthat humanity’s consciousness goes through a cycle of development; humanity’sawareness, perception, and abilities advance and then decline in a recurringcycle. This concept has been a part of the traditional cultural lore of numerouscultures as far back as anyone can determine. Perhaps best known to those of usin the West is the ancient Greek description of descending ages—from the goldenage, through silver and bronze, and finally into the iron age. The tradition ofdescending ages exists throughout the world. In Giorgio de Santillana’s Hamlet’sMill, he explores scores of such traditions.In India, the tradition of descending ages is known as the yugas or the yugacycle. (Yuga simply means “age.”) The yuga cycle, however, stands apart from theother traditional descriptions of the same phenomenon. Modern exponents of theyuga cycle, such as Sri Yukteswar, whose description of the yuga cycle appearsin his book The Holy Science, written in 1894, offer both dates and explanationsfor cycle.Sri Yukteswar provides specific dates for the beginning and end of each age oryuga. Moreover, unlike most traditions of descending ages, in which humanity issaid to still be at the nadir of its development, Sri Yukteswar states thathumanity reached its nadir in 500 CE, but since then people have begun toadvance once more—as you can see in figure 2.1.[../Images/img0070.jpg]Figure 2.1. The yuga cyclePerhaps even more important for explaining the ancient past than the specificityof dates is Sri Yukteswar’s description of humanity’s consciousness in eachyuga. His clear description of ancient humankind’s consciousness and abilitiesmay well allow us to finally understand some of the more enduring mysteries ofthe ancient past.CASE IN POINT: TRETA YUGA AND THE VEDASThe Rig Veda, a collection of over ten thousand Sanskrit verses, is the oldestknown spiritual work in the world and can be dated to as early as 7300 BCE. TheRig Veda is the wellspring of spiritual knowledge for what we know as Hinduismand has remained so for over nine thousand years. It is written in Sanskrit, inall likelihood the oldest language on Earth, and to this day it remains the mostprecise and internally consistent system of communication in the world. Computerprogrammers have studied Sanskrit’s structure and grammar to help them createprogramming languages free of ambiguity.The Vedas were accurately passed down from generation to generation in India byvirtue of an extremely methodical system of oral transmission, which involvedchanting each verse in ten different ways to cross-check for integrity. It isbelieved that only two words have become corrupted in over nine thousand years.Such an effective and elaborate system of oral transmission is amazing initself, but more amazing yet is that there is a large body of astronomical,mathematical, and physical knowledge embedded in the Vedas, knowledge popularlybelieved not to have been discovered in Europe until the Renaissance and later.Contemporary scientists have found the following facts embedded in the Vedas.The sun and planets are spherical.Each of the seven colors of the rainbow carries a different amount of energy.The sun is the source of all energy for life on Earth.Earth rotates around the sun.The sun, Earth, and other planets rotate on their own axes.Earth’s rotation creates night and day.Earth’s orbital path and axial tilt result in the seasons.The poles have six-month-long nights and days.The two tropics and the equator are separated by 24 degrees.Earth has a slightly elliptical orbit.Because of its orbit around the sun, the planet Venus is both the evening starand the morning star.The apparent movement of sunspots is due to the rotation of the sun.As seen from Earth, the full rotation of the sun takes twenty-seven days.Earth’s orbit around the sun creates a plane, and on that plane are the twelvedivisions of the zodiac.The length of a solar year is 365,244 days.The moon’s light is reflected from the sun.The sun’s energy is generated by a continuous process at its core.The sun is gaseous.Seventy percent of Earth’s surface is covered by water.The clouds consist of heat-produced water vapor, which in turn gives rise torain.The stars are “innumerable.”The stars exist in collections (niharikas), or galaxies, which rotate aroundtheir own center points.Earth and sun are part of a galaxy that rotates around a center point.The physical world is made up of atoms.The atoms have an internal structure resembling the solar system.In addition, the following concepts and calculations are embedded in the Vedas.The cause and timing of solar and lunar eclipsesThe precession of the equinoxesThe symbol and concept for zeroThe decimal system of notationThe concept of infinityThe concept of arithmetic progressionThe concept and value of piThe formula for calculating the area of a circleThe concept of a number up to 10¹⁸The theorem of diagonals (the Pythagorean theorem)The means to determine square roots and cube rootsThe concept of negative numbersThe concept of algebraic equations using letter symbols for unknown quantitiesThe conception and expression of quadratic and indeterminate equationsThe geometry of the triangle, parallelogram, rectangle, and circleThe geometry of the sphere, cone, and pyramidHow does one explain this?The Vedas are, after all, spiritual tools, sacred writ. The verses of the Vedasare mantras whose purpose is to raise the consciousness of those who chant them.The verses of the Vedas express an intimate relationship of humanity and theDivine. Yet, at the same time, they contain scientific knowledge—knowledge thatis currently believed to be attainable only through sequentially developedmathematics, scientific instruments such as the telescope, and a rigorouslyapplied methodology of experimentation.According to Sri Yukteswar, in the most recent Treta Yuga (6700 to 3100 BCE),during which the Vedas were composed, people were able to directly comprehendthat everything is made up of ideas or thoughts. The attunement of Treta Yugapeople to thought also made them highly intuitive—able to perceive truthswithout the need for the cumbersome process of experimentation.If human beings once possessed such awareness and comprehension in the ancientpast then they would have had no need to use the tools of science as weunderstand them today. They would have perceived these truths directly throughintuition. The “scientific” truths of the Vedas were perceived right along withspiritual truths as part of the same indivisible reality.If such an explanation seems farfetched, let me offer you an interesting exampleof intuitively derived—and very precise—scientific information that wasdiscovered around the turn of the twentieth century.Annie Besant and Charles Webster Leadbeater, prominent members of theTheosophical Society, conducted intuitive investigations into the nature ofatoms. They compiled a large number of descriptions and drawings of what theyobserved while in deep trances. Their descriptions and drawings were quitedetailed and complex—in fact, more complex than the known facts of the day.Many years after the deaths of Besant and Leadbeater, physicist Dr. Steven M.Phillips began to study their journals. He published his findings in 1980 inExtra-Sensory Perception of Quarks. A thorough examination of their psychicinvestigations led Phillips to conclude that Besant and Leadbeater hadaccurately described the number and nature of quarks—subatomic particles thatmake up the larger structures of the nucleus of the atom, such as protons andneutrons—years ahead of their discovery by modern physics.The yugas, as explained by Sri Yukteswar, require no outside influence toexplain the mysteries of the past. The yugas simply say that as humanity’sconsciousness advances, its knowledge, perception, and abilities advance aswell. Humans don’t merely know more as the yugas advance, they become more.My coauthor, David Steinmetz, and I found an amazingly clear archaeological andhistorical footprint to match the dates and consciousness of each yuga. Nor didwe have to rely on the strange, unusual, or controversial to see the footprint.A clear view of the arc of the yugas can be seen in the broad trends andaccepted facts of the past and present. We believe that the yuga cycle couldserve as a framework for the discoveries and work of many researchers andauthors in the field of alternative history."},{"pageContent":"T H R E ETHE VEDIC LITERATURE OF ANCIENT INDIA AND ITS MANY SECRETSDAVID FRAWLEYSECRETS OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS: THE VEDIC CONNECTIONSSecrets of ancient humanity and lost civilizations can be found all over theworld. Yet they are perhaps most common in India, with its characteristic regardfor the sacred, where even today the spiritual practices of the ancient worldcontinue. The same types of temples with similar forms of ritual worship thatwere known in ancient Egypt, Babylonia, or Greece thousands of years ago stilloccur throughout India today, from Badrinath in the Himalayas to the north toKanyakumari in the south. Indeed, it seems that the ancient world never ended inIndia but has continually maintained and, at times, reinvented itself. Spiritualand occult arts that abounded in the ancient world— including yoga, Vedicastrology, ayurvedic medicine, and the use of rituals (yajnas)—to improve allaspects of our lives remain commonly used and are honored by the culture ofIndia as a whole. Indeed, we could say that India is a living museum of theancient world and its lost civilizations. To understand the ancient world, itmay be better to visit the holy places of India where the ancient traditions arestill unbroken, rather than try to interpret ancient ruins through bricks andpottery shards, which scholars today usually do according to their own modernmind-sets, not recognizing the all-pervasive regard for the sacred that was thebasis of ancient life and culture.Most notably, ancient India presents us with by far the largest survivingliterature from the ancient world. The Vedic literature of India, by allaccounts dating from well before the time of the Buddha (500 BCE) and bytraditional accounts extending back well over five thousand years (3100 BCE),covers several thousand pages. This literature includes the four Vedas (Rig,Yajur, Sama, and Atharva) and their various Brahmanas, Aranyakas, andUpanishads.The Vedas contain many ancient poems, commentaries, dialogues, and teachings, ofwhich the famous Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita—the bedrock of Indian philosophyand yoga—represent only the last layer or a late summation. There is nocomparable ancient literature remaining from any other country, much less anongoing tradition of its interpretation and application through ritual andmeditation.The Vedas are not directly concerned with history or with the mundane aspects ofculture, yet these are mentioned in a peripheral way in the texts. In the Vedas,we can find references to the names of peoples, places, and certain events. Inaddition to deep spiritual knowledge, there are indications of astronomical,mathematical, and medical knowledge of a profound order. Natural disasters andmajor geologic events, such as floods, earthquakes, the melting of glaciers, andthe shifting of rivers, were also recorded, with a sense of the long history ofEarth and how life is based on and has evolved with these changes.Yet, even by way of understanding their spiritual side, it requires a deepervision to appreciate the Vedas. The Vedas are composed in a cryptic mantric codethat cannot be understood without the proper orientation and right keys. Vedicmantras were said to have been understood by great yogis and seers of the cosmicmind. They reflect a different type of language in which the higher truth isdeliberately hidden behind a veil of symbols, sacred sounds, andcorrespondences. A story that is apparently about seeking cows and horses, forexample, can inwardly refer to a development of higher powers of the senses(cows) and pranas or vital energies (horses). In fact, Vedic words have manylayers of meaning, of which the surface appearance can be misleading,particularly to the modern mind, which is not used to such multidimensionallanguage. This is also a phenomenon that we find throughout the ancient world.The Egyptian Book of the Dead, for example, abounds in similar symbols that,unless we can grasp the spiritual meaning, which few may be willing to look for,can appear quite superstitious.The Vedas say, “The Gods prefer the cryptic and dislike the obvious.” The higherpowers speak in symbols, riddles, paradoxes, or conundrums. The Vedas speak offour levels of speech, of which ordinary human beings only know and speak withone (Rig Veda I.164.45). They refer to a divine word or imperishable syllable onwhich they are based (Rig Veda I.164.39). They reflect a pattern of cosmic soundthat underlies all the laws of the universe and has its counterparts on alllevels of both individual and cosmic manifestation. For this reason, the Vedaswere called the shruti, or revelation, behind the Hindu tradition.The Vedas speak of secret meanings to their mantras that were veiled to protectthe teaching from its application by the spiritually immature. To receive thekey to the Vedic mantras required years of ascetic practices, such as recitingmantras, practicing yoga, and meditating, along with special initiations and thefavor of a teacher who knew the tradition and had deeply realized the teachingin his own consciousness. We cannot expect such cryptic mantras to unlock theirsecrets to a casual reading, particularly of limited or bad translations in alanguage and mind-set quite alien to the Vedic or ancient worldview.Modern scholars, particularly from the West, have not been able decipher thisVedic code. Most have not even recognized that it exists. This is not surprisingbecause scholars have largely failed to understand the deeper meaning of thesymbols of ancient Egypt, Sumeria, Mexico, and other ancient cultures. Ancientcultures like India and Egypt were carrying on great traditions of spiritual andoccult knowledge, not just the rudiments of technology and trade or empirebuilding.¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3111_0] Since modern scholars have littlebackground in that spiritual knowledge, with its recognition of higher states ofconsciousness extending into the infinite and eternal, naturally they cannotfind the symbols in which it is specially encrypted.Scholars look upon the Vedas in the same way they perceive the religion of theancient Egyptians—as little more than primitive nature worship. But nature isused to symbolize a vast cosmos. For example, in the Vedas, fire connects to thefire of the breath, the fire of the mind, the fire of consciousness, and thecosmic fire through which the entire universe exists.²[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3113_0]This failure to understand the ancient literature is often related to a failureto understand ancient archaeological ruins and their implications. Ancient sitesabound in artifacts that reflect the same type of spiritual symbolism of theancient literature. These are usually dismissed as fetishes rather than lookingfor any deeper meaning.Once we have decoded the mantric and symbolic nature of the Vedic language,Vedic literature can help us understand the ancient world and the ancientmind—its symbols, rituals, and aspirations, as well as the legacy and heritagethat it has left for us. But it requires that we approach the ancient teachingswith an honoring of the sacred, a respect for our elders and gurus, a regard forour ancient human spiritual heritage, and a devotion to the cosmic powers of thegreater conscious universe.THE LIVING VEDIC TRADITIONThe Vedic tradition remains alive, and many great modern yogis have given theircomments on the Vedas and have revealed some of the Vedic secrets to the modernworld. Sri Aurobindo (1872–1950), perhaps modern India’s greatest philosopher,among his voluminous writings wrote several books on the Vedas and translatedmany Vedic hymns according to an inner yogic meaning.³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3115_0] Many of his disciples, such as Kapali Shastri,M. P. Pandit, and R. L. Kashyap, have expanded this work.Ganapati Muni (1878–1936), the chief disciple of the great Indian guru RamanaMaharshi, left a number of important Sanskrit works on the Vedas, as did hisdisciple Brahmarshi Daivarata.Swami Dayananda (1828–1886), founder of the Arya Samaj, the largest modern Hindusect, based his entire movement on a return to the Vedas and recognition of adeeper spiritual and scientific knowledge in Vedic texts, a task that many ofhis disciples have expanded in a number of books, teachings, research, andschools.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (founder of Transcendental Meditation) based his work onthe Vedic mantras and through them promoted a renaissance of all the Vedicsciences including ayurveda, Vedic astrology, and vaastu shastra.Other great modern yogis, like Paramahansa Yogananda, author of Autobiography ofa Yogi, have written about the greatness of the Vedas, their antiquity, and theVedic culture as one of the main sources for ancient civilization and worldspirituality, though they have not written specifically on the Vedic textsthemselves.The Theosophical Society, particularly the writings of H. P. Blavatsky,similarly affirmed the deeper meaning of the Vedas. She wrote of how the Vedaswere composed by the rishis mainly when they resided by the Manasarovar Lake byMount Kailas in Tibet.Such a view of the Vedas as a spiritual treasure-house of great antiquityremains at odds with dominant academic views, which regard the Vedas as aprimitive product of invading nomads into India around 1500 BCE, the so-calledAryan invasion theory. This theory proposed that the Vedic people, calledAryans, were a light-skinned racial group from Central Asia who invaded anddestroyed the native cultures of India, bringing in the Vedic literature alongwith them. Though this theory has never been proved or linked to any conclusiveevidence on the ground, it has not been abandoned by textbooks either. Thistheory, though it has been reduced from an invasion to a migration and now tolargely a language change, continues to persist.The theory that Vedic culture was originally based outside India was firstproposed by Western scholarship a few centuries ago to explain connectionsbetween the languages of India and Europe, which all belong to the Indo-Europeanfamily of languages and share many similarities in grammar. An equally validtheory, however—and one that agrees more with both the literary andarchaeological data—would have such linguistic influences derive from India andits nearby regions.⁴ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3117_0] But during the colonialera, when the Aryan invasion idea was formed, India as a source of Westernculture or languages was not such an appealing idea.The Vedic tradition, we should note, has its own view of history. While theVedas themselves as religious works do not contain specific or completehistorical accounts, the Puranas, another set of ancient Indian literature, havea list of over a hundred kings going back before the time of Buddha and adelineation of many dynasties from throughout greater India going back to Manu,the primal king at the time of a great flood.More importantly, Vedic and Puranic literature speaks of previous world agescalled yugas and kalpas, extending back many tens of thousands of years andconnected to astronomical cycles of various types going back millions of years.They hold that our current civilization is neither the first, nor the highest.In fact, they regard it as a fallen materialistic culture of low spiritualdevelopment. The Vedas and Puranas also speak of contact with beings of otherworlds, both in subtle realms and other physical planets, regarding true humancivilization as linked to the greater universe. Such ideas of human history asdetermined by cosmic time cycles are shared by many other ancient cultures, suchas Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, and Mexico, and are characteristic of ancientthought as a whole.Sri Yukteswar, guru of Paramahansa Yogananda, in his book Holy Science, relatesthe fifth and last Manu or founder of Indian civilization to a period that endedaround 6700 BCE. This information is similar to what the Greeks found in Indiaat the time of Alexander circa 300 BCE. Megasthenes in his Indika, stillavailable in fragments, recorded a tradition of 153 kings in India going backover 6,400 years, to a date around 6700 BCE. The king lists of Egypt are not aslong as these.This Vedic view of the yugas or world ages, particularly the 24,000 great year,such as Yukteswar describes, is important for understanding Vedic thought andits antiquity, as well as its outlook for the future.⁵[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3119_0] It tells us that we cannot put the Vedas in ahistorical time line of three thousand years as scholars would still like todo.*1 [../Text/ch23.html#anchor_3064_0]MY WORK AS A VEDIC SCHOLAR AND VEDIC PRACTITIONERIn my personal work, I have spent more than thirty years studying, translating,and writing on the Vedas and connected Vedic sciences, including yoga, ayurveda,and Vedic astrology. I have written several books on the Vedic view of ancienthistory, as well as translating over a hundred of the Vedic hymns. This hasresulted in more than thirty books and over a hundred articles on these topics.I learned traditional Vedic Sanskrit and have gone through the Vedic textsrepeatedly in the original language, with recourse to Sanskrit commentaries andthe works of modern yogis like Ganapati Muni. I approached the Vedas accordingto an inner vision born of poetry, study of symbolism, and a practice of yogaand meditation. I received a training in the Vedic tradition itself, studyingwith gurus, pandits, and yogis in India. For this reason, my views of the Vedascan be different than those of scholars writing on the subject, who have nottrained in the Vedic tradition and are usually unaware of its views.My views, therefore, are from inside the tradition. These ancient traditionsstill have their own voices, and hopefully, I can at least provide a goodalternative to the nonspiritual approach to Vedic texts, which is what isusually presented in universities today. Early on in my studies, it was obviousto me that what we find in existing historical accounts and translations onlytouches the surface of the Vedic teachings.VEDAS AND ANCIENT YOGIC AND OCCULT KNOWLEDGEThe Vedas contain spiritual, occult, and cosmic secrets that we are justbeginning to become aware of. The great India-based religions of Hinduism,Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism may represent only later aspects of ancientenlightenment traditions that were probably more common during the Vedic era.The Vedas represent the remains of these early traditions, of which there wereno doubt many more.Vedic literature portrays an ancient solar religion of yoga and enlightenment,such as was once common throughout the entire world. The sun is a symbol of thehigher self, the atman or purusha of yogic thought. This Vedic religion of lightis a religion of consciousness, which is the supreme form of light.⁶[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3121_0]The Vedic teaching centers a worship of the sacred fire, called agni, throughwhich we can connect to the cosmic powers. It details many yajnas, or firesacrifices, that can help attune us to the blessings of the universe and thatremain the foundation of yogic and Hindu rituals to the present day.⁷[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3123_0]The Vedic teaching used special sacred plants called somas. These were powerfulplants used in preparations to promote longevity, counter disease, aid inrejuvenation, and help us access higher states of consciousness. Vedic doctorsare mentioned in Vedic texts along with special herbs, ghees (oils), and somamixtures of great power.Yet soma refers not just to the physical plants but to an inner practice. TheVedic science of soma included ways of accessing our own sacred plant or innerset of energies through the spine, brain, and nervous system. Indeed, theoriginal soma was not a single plant but an entire science of inner and outerhealing, with soma plants corresponding to inner yogic somas of mantra,pranayama, and meditation. Such yogic somas are more important than the plantsomas and more crucial for not only accessing but remaining in higher states ofawareness.⁸ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3125_0]Outer Vedic ritualistic practices mirror inner yoga practices, balancing thefire and water and the agni and soma within us. Vedic literature contains thesecrets of the practice of yoga, including the ascending of the kundalini fireforce and the descent of the soma nectar that opens all the chakras. Thepractice of yoga itself arose from the inner Vedic sacrifice in which speech,mind, and prana were offered to the immortal divine fire present within our ownhearts.⁹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3127_0] Vedic deities reflect a profoundpsychological and spiritual symbolism relative to the practice of yoga andmeditation, not just outer ritualistic concerns.The Vedas may hold in their mantras the keys to the yogic and shamanic secretsof ancient humanity. The Vedic rishis describe in their hymns various higherstates of consciousness, including self-realization, like the great sageVamadeva (Rig Veda IX.26.1), who proclaims “I was Manu and I am the Sun”—astatement quoted in the Upanishads (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad I. 4.10) relativeto the realization of Brahman or the absolute.Vedic mantras have been described as a kind of universal language. ClassicalSanskrit, which evolved out of Vedic Sanskrit, remains the most scientificlanguage in the world. The Vedic language is the oldest of all Indo-Europeanlanguages and the best-preserved language that we have from the ancient world.Since language, itself, is the best repository of culture, the Vedic language isperhaps our best key not only to ancient culture but to the ancient mind, whichis very different in its worldview and orientation than the modern mind.Mathematical secrets of the universe are mentioned in the Vedas, like a timecycle of 4,320,000,000 years and names for numbers from 1 to 10 to 10 followedby twelve zeroes (10,000,000,000,000). The zodiacal number 360 and its divisionsand derivatives are common in Vedic texts. Vedic mantras are said to be inherentin the rays of the sun. Noted Vedic scholar Subhash Kak has found a planetarycode in the numbering of the books of the Rig Veda.¹⁰[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3129_0]Vedic astrology contains an extensive knowledge not only of the planets, signs,and houses but of the twenty-seven nakshatras or lunar constellations going backto the Vedas.¹¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3131_0] The Vedas relate thenakshatras to various deities and rishis and state that after death the soul cantravel to the star it is most connected to in life. The mythology of thenakshatras is quite profound and helps us understand the ancient star lore ofmany cultures.Vedic astrology divides the lunar month of 29.5 solar days into 30 equal lunardays or tithis. This amounts to 371 tithis in a solar year of 365 days. Thenumber of deities in the Rig Veda are 3,339, or 371 times the mystic number 9,reflecting the importance of the influence of the moon. The Vedas were orientedto astronomical influences of a profound order and at perhaps a much earlierdate than that of Babylonia.¹² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3133_0]Vedic vaastu, its architectural and directional science, shows how the greatforces of the universe impact us through the orientation of our rooms andbuildings and the direction that we face. Ayurvedic medicine preserves manyVedic secrets of herbs, foods, subtle physiology, and keys to rejuvenation. Itis still widely practiced in India and becoming recognized worldwide.Vedic mantras themselves have a tremendous power to change the psyche and bringin higher cosmic influences into our minds and hearts. Vedic mantras likeGayatri (Rig Veda III.62.10) to the sun god are still practiced by millions inIndia and are now being taken up by many in the West as well.A few salient points about ancient history and Vedas:Besides the knowledge side of the Vedas, there are also important historicalimplications of the Vedic literature. Vedic literature along with the currentstate of archaeology and genetics suggests a much longer history for the Vedasin India, perhaps extending into the ice age period. It suggests that the Vedicidea of previous cycles of civilization may indeed reflect ice age cultures. Forexample, the Puranas regard agriculture the creation of Manu Chakshusha, thefourth Manu, before the fifth Manu Vivasvan of the flood. We do note thatagriculture began already in the late ice age period more than ten thousandyears ago. Many of these points are mentioned in Underworld: Flooded Kingdoms ofthe Ice Age, by Graham Hancock. Hancock quotes my work and that of other Vedicscholars like N. S. Rajaram on several issues, particularly in his sections onIndia.Ancient India of the third millennium BCE presents us with the largest urbancivilization of the ancient world and the most uniform, with hundreds of sitesfrom Afghanistan in the northwest to across the Ganga in the northeast, to thecoast of Iran in the southwest, and nearly to Mumbai in the southeast. Thiscivilization is usually called the Indus Valley civilization, as the main siteswere found by the Indus River; it is also called the Harappan civilization afterthe city of Harappa, which it was centered around.¹³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3135_0]Mohenjodaro and Harappa are the two most famous and best excavated of theHarappan sites. Today, there are five sites larger in size than Mohenjodaro andHarappa, though not as well excavated, and over two thousand smaller sites, thelargest being Rakhigari in the Kurukshetra region west of Delhi. This Harappanor Indus civilization is the largest in size and the greatest in uniformity ofall ancient civilizations, and India at the time, as India today, hosted a muchlarger population than the arid regions of the Near East.However, modern scholars portray this Harappan culture as a civilization withouta literature, a mysterious civilization that arose and disappeared with littleconnection to the later history and peoples of India. Meanwhile, the Vedas,which, as we have already noted, represent the largest literature from theancient world, are portrayed by scholars as a literature without a civilization.In other words, the largest urban civilization of the ancient world is portrayedas civilization without a literary record, while the largest literary record ofthe ancient world is regarded as a literature without a civilization, thoughboth come from the same part of the world and are traditionally linked together.Yet if we simply combine these two, the Harappan ruins and the Vedic literature,we can end the mystery on both sides. Both the Harappan ruins and Vedicliterature speak of the same region and reflect many of the same artifacts andpractices. For example, the most common symbol found in the Harappan ruins isthe swastika, which is the most sacred symbol of Hindu and Buddhist thought.Indus sites also contain fire altars, sacred water tanks, and images of figuresseated in meditation (proto-Shiva) or performing yoga postures, such as Vedicand Hindu thought has always given prominence to.Moreover, the so-called Indus Valley civilization is not located on the banks ofthe Indus River. The great majority of ancient urban ruins in India have beendiscovered on the dried banks of the river traditionally called the Sarasvati,which flowed to the east of the Indus. Landsat satellite photography hasrevealed that the Sarasvati was once a huge river system, up to five miles widein northwest India, east of the Yamuna River, that dried up around 2000 BCE.Vedic literature also mentions the Sarasvati River, the most revered of all theVedic rivers and the great mother of the Vedic people. The Vedas and laterliterature locate the Sarasvati east of the Yamuna. The Vedic river hymn startswith the Ganga, Yamuna, and Sarasvati rivers and then identifies other rivers tothe west. The sacred land of the Vedic people in Vedic literature (Rig VedaIII.23.4) and Manu Samhita is situated between the two divine rivers, Sarasvatiand Drishadvati, in the Kurukshetra region west of Delhi, where the MahabharataWar was fought at the time of Krishna. Both Sarasvati and Drishadvati were greatrivers in ancient times before largely disappearing around four thousand yearsago except as occasional run-off streams. That the Vedas speak of these riversas their immemorial homeland is a strong evidence of their antiquity.Moreover, the Rig Veda speaks of the Sarasvati as the largest river of theregion, pure in its course from the mountains to the sea (Rig Veda VII.95.2).Later texts, like the Mahabharata, speak of the Sarasvati as a broken streamdrying up into a series of lakes in what are now Rajasthan and Haryana.¹⁴[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3137_0] Disasters along nearby rivers like theShutudri (Sutlej) are mentioned in the Mahabharata, with the river breaking intoa hundred streams, reflecting the changing of rivers in the region.The Vedas as a lost civilization rest upon these lost rivers. After the ice ageended, the melting of glaciers kept the river flows in north India much higher,until the bulk of the glaciers melted. Most notably, to date there is noarchaeological evidence of any Aryan invasion or migration into India. No onehas ever been able to locate the so-called Aryans in the archaeological records.The attempts to do so, like that of Mortimer Wheeler and his proposed massacreat Mohenjodaro, have proven erroneous and are no longer accepted. There are noAryan skeletons, no Aryan horses or chariot remains, no Aryan encampments or anyidentifiable special Aryan artifacts, no remains of cities destroyed by theAryans, and no memory or literary records of any such invasion in the history ofIndia, whether in the Vedas, Puranas, or Buddhist and Jain literature. In otherwords, apart from linguistic speculation, which itself has many variantopinions, there is nothing in the archaeological record to show any incomingAryans at all.¹⁵ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3139_0]The whole idea of an Aryan race has been discredited, along with most of thenineteenth-century views it was connected to. The Aryan race idea was a productof European nationalism, not of Vedic thought, for which Aryan was a term ofnobility only, not ethnicity. It is much like the swastika, which is a Hindu andBuddhist symbol of the wheel of dharma, which the German Nazis perverted into aNazi symbol.The Indus or Harappan culture came to an end owing to geological and climatechanges, along with the drying up of the Sarasvati River. The decline of theriver began by 3000 BCE before ending around 1700 BCE. But the same peoplesremained and continued the same types of arts, crafts, and customs until thenext urban phase began on the Ganga a few centuries later.Relative to natural history and genetics, it is now known that the people ofIndia have been continuously occupying their country for more than fiftythousand years. India’s subtropical climate enabled them to remain in Indiathroughout the ice ages, unlike Europe and Central Asia, which became largelyuninhabitable during the ice age glaciations. There is to date no genetic recordof any incoming Aryans. The main genetic markers are of a movement of peoplesoutside Southeast Asia after the ice age ended and displaced the populationsthere. The so-called incoming Aryans have failed to turn up in the geneticrecord as well. Rather, we see the continuity of the same peoples in India goingback into the ice age period.¹⁶ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3141_0]Curiously, the Vedic and Puranic view is that the Vedic people hailed from thesouth of India after a great flood. The Puranas relate that Vedic Manu, a greatyogi, came from Kerala (Malaya) in the south (Matsya Purana I.13–14). Vedicrishis and sages like Vasishta and Agastya are connected to the south. In fact,the Bhrigus, one of the two main families of the Vedic rishis, are descendantsof Varuna, the god of the ocean. The Rig Veda itself has over 150 references tothe ocean (samudra), as well as to ocean travel and crossing oceans and rivers,though Western scholars claim the Rig Veda is a product of landlocked nomadsfrom Central Asia! The Vedic people likely came from the south of India, perhapsconnected to the fabled Kanya Kumari continent, which was said to have existedbefore the waters rose at the end of the ice age and submerged it.IMPLICATIONSIf the Vedas do contain such spiritual and yogic secrets, this affirms the ideafound not only in Vedic literature but throughout the ancient world that inancient times people were more spiritually evolved than today. We find a similarmyth of a primordial spiritual golden age in the Taoist literature of China, inBabylonian ideas of earlier ages, and in Hopi and Mayan literature. In this way,the Vedas are a record of that golden age and provide a direct link to thewisdom of that more evolved era.If Vedic civilization is indigenous to India, then we would need to rewriteworld history, particularly the history of the Europeans. We would find that theIndo-European groups of Europe, which include Greeks, Romans, Celts, Germans,Slavs, and others, must have had a great cultural affinity with India beforetheir connections to the Near East or their dispersal throughout Europe.¹⁷[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3143_0] This would be just one aspect of connectingancient cultures with still older cultures that perhaps extended back into theice ages.Clearly, there are many secrets of lost civilizations, and in seeking these out,we cannot forget the role of India, where the ancient world still lives. Thehistory and literature of India, reflecting a knowledge of lost civilizations,should be given greater attention—not only the Vedas but also the Puranas andvarious yogic texts.CONCLUSIONThe Vedas are not the only ancient culture or the sole repository of wisdom,though they are certainly much more important than our current historicalaccounts indicate. Probably, all the main ancient cultures in the world are mucholder, more evolved, and more spiritually based than what modern historyascribes to them. Similarly, ancient populations and languages may be much olderthan current estimates indicate, such as the Proto-Europeans and Persians, whoare also regarded by modern scholars as products of nomadic invasions from thenorth and east.Our current human history of 5,000 years makes little sense if our species isover 150,000 years old, as current science estimates. The destructive effects ofthe end of the ice age, which saw huge land masses and coastlines submerged, thedestructive influence of long periods of time, and the lack of attention bymodern scholars used to a short historical time line may explain why suchancient and pre–ice age cultures have not been better discovered or recognized,even though in the case of India, they are still alive among us.¹⁸[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3145_0]True, history, not as mere technology but as the development of enlightenedcultures, likely goes back tens of thousands of years on all the continents. Thegreat civilizations of the early ancient world that we find, such as theSumerians, Egyptians, Maya, or ancient Hindus, are more likely the remnants orsurvivors of yet earlier great cultures that our history has so far failed touncover. Indeed, all the great ancient cultures that we have found do notpresent themselves as the founders of something new but as connected to earliercultures going back into the ice age and before.To go forward as a species into a real planetary age, we need to reclaim thisspiritual and yogic heritage of ancient humanity. It provides much of the wisdomwe need to help us deal with our global challenges. Our great gurus, elders, andancestors can still be called on. A few remain. Their voices can be heard. Theirwords have been recorded. But unless we approach them with respect and seek touncover the deeper meanings behind their mantras, symbols, and myths, we willnot be able to access their wisdom or gain their blessings and the blessings ofthe greater universe that they carry.¹⁹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3147_0]In light of such issues, we can discuss both the spiritual and historicalimplications of the Vedic literature. I can hopefully present the reader with aview from inside the Vedic tradition, reflecting the deeper Sanskrit meaningsand Vedic yogic practices that the reader, otherwise, may not find easily."},{"pageContent":"F O U RA COSMOLOGICAL JOURNEYHOW MODERN SCIENTIFIC DATA IS TAKING US BACK TO THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTSDR. MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTONA REALIZATION OF GALACTIC PROPORTIONS“Okay, that’s it! I can’t keep this to myself anymore.”It was early 2004, and I looked up from the report in New Scientist magazine.Antimatter had been found pouring from the heart of our very own Milky Waygalaxy, and astrophysicists did not know why.¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3151_0]But strange though this was, it was totally predictable from the theories I hadpublished in a paper the previous year.² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3153_0] Howwas it that I knew something that the astrophysicists themselves did not? Andwhy me? Why was a female, British Asian, medical general practitioner (GP)without even an A level in physics and barely out of her twenties coming up withall these ideas about the cosmos?It was that moment that prompted me to overcome my reservations about writingthe book that eventually became Punk Science: Inside the Mind of God.³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3155_0] I was in the middle of something big. I didn’tknow why—I just had to go with it and see where this road was leading me. It wasas if I wasn’t in control any more; this theory had begun to take over my life.THE ROAD TO EUREKABelieve me, this is not where I thought I would end up—putting forward a newtheory in physics. I am from a medical family and have trained as a GP like myparents. But after a spontaneous spiritual awakening, which happened in my firstfew weeks of medical school, I added a burgeoning mystical life to my medicalstudies. Pretty soon, I realized that the principles of the universe I wasexperiencing mystically must have their correlation within scientific realms.To start with, I simply wanted to explain these esoteric principles in terms ofmodern physics. Like authors who had published before me, I could see the linksbetween esoteric principles such as distant healing and nonlocality in quantumtheory. So I started learning about ideas in cutting-edge physics and comparingthese with traditional esoteric principles. My aim in the beginning was toprovide better care for my patients. I had a (perhaps naive) belief that ifdoctors simply understood the physics behind energy healing modalities, thenmaybe they would lose their fear of including them in medical practice, andpatients would then benefit from these powerful but nontoxic treatments. Butthis journey took me somewhere quite different.Gradually a different path emerged, and as I firmly stepped onto it, theuniverse moved around me creating extraordinary events leaving me free to studyand write full-time. I started writing a book, even though I had no publisherinitially, highlighting the links between cutting-edge biology and physics andesoteric ideas. But how did I end up going from being a GP wanting to help herpatients to making predictions about the universe that were rapidly being provedright?AT THE HEART OF EVERY GALAXYIt was the autumn of 2003, and I had become captivated by the field ofcosmology, which had been in turmoil since around the turn of the century withmany long-held beliefs becoming obsolete as data came pouring in fromtelescopes. Cosmologists had just faced one of their biggest challenges foryears: the unwelcome arrival of dark energy—a mysterious force that seemed to beblowing the universe apart and accelerating its expansion.Images from Hubble and other telescopes were throwing open some of ourlong-cherished beliefs and making us question our theories and expectationsabout the universe. I became particularly fascinated by black holes. The conceptof black holes started life as a conclusion of Einstein’s theory ofrelativity—that if space and time curved beyond a certain point, they wouldcreate a point of infinite gravity. Initially, it was thought that certain starscollapse at the end of their lives and produce these points of infinite densityand gravity, with a pull so powerful that not even light can escape—hence aso-called black hole.For decades, these objects remained a theoretical concept, and although theysparked the imaginations of science-fiction writers, it was not known if blackholes really existed. It was not until the dawning of the twenty-first century,when our telescopes were picking up black holes everywhere, that we realizedthat not only did back holes exist, but they were actually quite common.⁴[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3157_0] How is a black hole detected if no light canescape it? One of the ways is to look at the material around them, called anaccretion disc, which spins so fast that only the gravity of a black hole couldbe creating it.The amazing thing was that when we turned our telescopes on neighboringgalaxies, we found a supermassive black hole at the heart of each one. We evenfound a black hole at the center of our own galaxy! So instead of being rareexotic creatures, it turned out that black holes are actually quite common. Aswell as appearing in the heart of each galaxy, smaller black holes appearthroughout the galaxies. Sometimes, they are associated with objects such asquasars, which give out bright radiation.Hold on a minute: Why would a quasar, which has a black hole associated with it,give out such bright radiation? Surely the black hole would suck up all thelight so that we can’t see it? In fact, the more we looked, the more the dataindicated surprises that contradicted our current theories.THE GREAT ANNIHILATORSIt was in studying objects called microquasars, which are smaller versions ofquasars, that I started to find some answers. Microquasars also have a blackhole associated with them, but their behavior, again, is peculiar. They, too,are spewing out material very fast, despite the black hole associated with them.Sometimes they give out gamma ray radiation, sometimes electrons at close to thespeed of light, and sometimes the antimatter opposite of electrons—positrons.Because we know that within microquasars, antimatter and matter combine to formlight in the form of gamma rays in a process called annihilation, New Scientistmagazine dubbed them the Great Annihilators.⁵ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3159_0]What was the cause for this strange behavior? Why was this very fast materialbeing spewed out by microquasars? Why aren’t the black holes associated with themicroquasars sucking everything up? Astronomer Sir Martin Rees commented that weshould study microquasars. There was a general agreement that black holes allprobably behave in the same way, just at different scales, so what we find outabout black holes of this size will inform us about larger black holes.⁶[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3161_0][../Images/img0067.jpg]Figure 4.1. Antimatter and matter combine to form lightThe Universe SpeaksI was pondering all these conundrums—black holes, dark matter and dark energy,and microquasars—as I took a walk with my dog in the woods in the autumn of2003. I also wanted to find out how everything fitted together with the notionthat consciousness is fundamental to the universe, which has arisen out of thework of quantum physicists such as Amit Goswami and Fred Alan Wolf.⁷,[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3163_0] ⁸ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3165_0] Radicalscientists such as these have looked at the conclusions of quantum physics,which tell us that a subatomic particle only comes into existence when it ismeasured. They realized that the act of conscious observation has a role increating reality. Some physicists have gone further and concluded that, in fact,consciousness is fundamental to the universe.Mulling this all over in the woods, I decided to take a rest on the branch of anoak tree and remembered something I had seen years ago in a video featuring themathematical cosmologist Brian Swimme.⁹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3167_0] Herecommended that we take time to tune into the rotation of our own planet, andfor some reason, here on this branch of an oak tree, was the first time I triedit.What came next is something I find hard to describe, but it was if I had beenthrown into the very fabric of the universe and caught a glimpse of its secrets.Everything seemed to be made up of the most exquisite geometry and mathematics,which was at the same time both infinitely complex and ever so simple. And Isuddenly understood how black holes work, and it wasn’t at all how we hadpreviously theorized. I had been shown what I now call the black hole principle,and it was a discovery that would profoundly alter the course of my life.DIMENSIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESSTo understand the black hole principle, I need to first discuss a few otherscientific ideas. One is that the universe is made up of many dimensions. Thisconcept started in physics after Einstein had successfully united space andtime. Einstein did the equivalent of climbing up a hill to gain an overview of aseemingly disorganized crowd. From this higher perspective, the scene becomesunified; you can see the big picture instead of just seeing the chaos on theground.This is effectively what Einstein did in mathematical terms, and ever since,people have been trying to find a way to unite all the forces of nature.Sometimes they do this by creating higher dimensions, such as string theory.These higher dimensions are all around us, but we can’t see them because theyhave different geometrical qualities. Physicists used to think that thesedimensions are very small, but changed their minds and started realizing thatthese dimensions could be worlds of their own.¹⁰[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3169_0] So, according to physics, we live in auniverse of many dimensions.Another concept that has come out of academic physics in recent years is thatthe speed of light is not the speed limit of the universe. It sounds crazy, butsome radical thinkers, such as Joao Magueijo, have been postulating that the wayto solve some of the problems we have in cosmology, such as the horizon problemand the flatness problem, is to realize that the speed of light is variable andwas faster in the early universe.¹¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3171_0] Magueijoeven goes on to say that light is infinite and is curled up in higherdimensions.¹² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3173_0] So what we see as the speed oflight is actually a small fraction of its actual speed, which is infinite.Naturally, these ideas have caused a storm in the world of physics, with somepeople branding Magueijo and his colleagues as heretics.These two notions, of multiple dimensions and infinite light, when combined withideas coming from quantum theory present a universe alive with consciousness.And all this has come from physicists themselves in the academic world—not fromNew Age postulations—which makes these ideas all the more remarkable.[../Images/img0099.jpg]Figure 4.2. The perception horizonWhen I started to piece all this together, I realized that what we call darkmatter and dark energy is not actually dark at all—it is superbright!¹³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3175_0] What we have been calling the speed limit ofthe universe is not a speed limit at all; it is simply a reflection of thelimitations of consciousness in what we call our reality—three spatialdimensions and one of time. The speed of light then becomes the perceptionhorizon, beyond which we don’t perceive anything with our normal senses and orour instruments, which are attuned to this dimension alone. However, the areasof the universe that lie beyond this perception horizon are the realms thatmystics have been discussing throughout the ages—the light perceived in deepmeditative states.BLACK HOLES: THE SOURCE OF INFINITE LIGHTSo what does this have to do with black holes? Well, in that insightful instantduring my walk, which only lasted a few seconds but imparted volumes worth ofbooks to me, I realized that black holes are not dark guzzling monsters at all.We have got it all wrong. They are actually the source of infinite light. Thisinfinite light lies at the heart of black holes. It spirals from the center,down through the dimensions to the edge of our perception, where the light thensplits off into a particle of matter such as an electron and a particle ofantimatter—a positron. This is why we see electrons spewing out of black holesat the speed of light because they have only just reached our dimension andtherefore our perception.[../Images/img0072.jpg]Figure 4.3. The black hole principleAnd that is not all. This is a breathing process, and it works both ways.Positrons and electrons recombine to form gamma rays. Black holes are thereforethe source of the gamma ray bursts that we have seen coming from even thefurthest regions of our cosmos and have puzzled scientists for over fifty yearssince they were first discovered. We even have evidence of this breathingprocess happening near our own Milky Way galaxy. High-energy gases close to thecenter of our galaxy have been observed moving in and out, and nobody seems toknow why, but this finding totally fits our theory.¹⁴[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3177_0]BURPING BLACK HOLESWe may also be able to account for the strange patterns we see coming from blackholes. A lot of astrophysicists think that the emissions from black holes arethe result of explosions or black holes guzzling up matter such as stars,causing matter to be ejected in the process. But instead of a steady decay ofemissions, as would be expected after an explosion, the pattern is more erratic,leading to bizarre concepts such as the one that black holes burp up theirfood.¹⁵ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3179_0]Once we understand that a deeper process is occurring in black holes than justan explosion limited to our dimension, then we will no longer need to createbizarre explanations as we will have a simple, elegant theory that can make somepowerful predictions.I also realized that the black hole principle does not just end with black holesin the cosmos; this same signature behavior is present at every level in afractal fashion—from objects as small as atoms and quarks to supermassive blackholes and even structures in between, such as stars and planets. If I am right,we would see the following types of behaviors in structures:Emission of electrons at almost light speedsThe presence of antimatter and matter annihilationEmission of antimatterGamma ray radiation emissionsPatterns that are unpredictable—with hours or maybe days between flaresA bipolar jetlike concentrated pattern of emissions (see color plate 1[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1547_0])THE FRACTAL WORLDAfter publishing my initial ideas in a journal in the winter of 2003, I spentthe next two years researching and verifying this theory, which I called theblack hole principle. Sure enough, a lot of the unexplained behaviors of variousobjects in the cosmos, from red dwarfs to planets, fit this pattern. Even cometswere throwing up surprises for astrophysicists, but not for me—their behaviorfit the black hole principle perfectly.¹⁶ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3181_0]Behavior that we have known about for a long time, like radioactivity and thequantum jumps of an electron within an atom, can now be seen in a newperspective.Even planets and stars show the same pattern of periodic ejections and emissionsof high-energy electrons and light. Just look at the X-ray and gamma rayradiation found around the planets of our solar system, the mysterious plumesgiven off by Jupiter, and solar flares, which remarkably display the samecycling of antimatter and matter that we see in supermassive black holes.¹⁷,[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3183_0] ¹⁸ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3185_0]Our own planet Earth is the site of some astonishing evidence of the black holeprinciple. Now surely, our own planet cannot be full of fractal black holes? Butif you remember, the term black hole is now a misnomer as they are actually thesource of infinite light and are the creative forces in the cosmos. It issomething that cosmologists themselves were forced to announce in 2010 mainlybecause the size of each galaxy has such a direct correlation to the size of thesupermassive black hole at its center that it was no longer possible to deny thecreative role of black holes.¹⁹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3187_0]BOLT UPRIGHTSo let’s look back at some of the criteria for black hole behavior and compareit to our own planet. Where do we see high-energy electrons moving at very fastspeeds? In lightning! We are often given the impression that lightning iscreated by a sort of static electricity that builds up in the clouds, but nobodyhas been able to prove this. The measurements that have been taken actually showthat the power buildup is not nearly enough to cause a bolt of lightning.²⁰[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3189_0]When a lightning bolt hits Earth, it is traveling at one-third the speed oflight. Amazingly, recent discoveries have shown that gamma ray flashes thatexist in Earth’s upper atmosphere are associated with thunderstorms andlightning bolts, and just this year alone (2011), NASA has also found thatantimatter is being emitted too (see plate 2[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1551_0]).²¹, [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3191_0] ²²[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3193_0] So now we have periodic ejections ofelectrons, gamma rays, and antimatter as well as the presence of matter andantimatter annihilation, just as we find in a supermassive black hole at thecenter of a galaxy.²³ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3195_0] But it is happening notin outer space but in our own atmosphere! This same black hole principle ishappening at every single level. There are many more examples given in the bookPunk Science, which includes DNA, quarks, and the long-derided concept ofchakras.²⁴ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3197_0]We live in a fractal black hole universe with the signature of creationhappening at every single level in everything. Every level of the universe isbeing created in every moment via spirals of light from infinity. When theyreach our dimension, delineated at what we are currently calling the speed oflight but is really the limitation of our perceptions in our dimension, theysplit into the antimatter and the matter that make up our universe and a mirroruniverse to ours. The matter universe is the one that we are mostly aware of inour daily lives.BANG GOES THE THEORYThis means that creation is happening at every single level, not just at onesingle point fifteen billion years ago; there was no big bang. Astonishingly,the very evidence that was supposed to support the big bang theory is showing upits deficiencies, and this has prompted a group of cosmologists to form theAlternative Cosmology Group, protesting that unless you work on the big bangtheory, you will not get academic funding.²⁵ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3199_0]However, the more we look at the evidence, the more the big bang theorydisintegrates. For example, when we started looking deeper into the universe, weexpected to find that we would see only younger stars; as it has taken a longertime for the light to reach us, we should be looking into the early universe.But that is not the case. No matter where we look, the universe looks thesame—old stars and young stars appear everywhere.²⁶[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3201_0]The other piece of evidence that was supposed to cement the big bang theory but,instead, derailed it was the measurement of microwave background radiation.Discovered by accident in the 1960s by Penzias and Wilson, this radiation hasbeen interpreted as the remnants of the big bang. We even faintly pick it up asthe snowstorm picture on our television sets.But strange features started to appear in the microwave background. Curiousalignments and axes were seen that relate to current structures.²⁷,[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3203_0] ²⁸ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3205_0] Thismeant that instead of being related to an event that happened billions of yearsago, the microwave background shows alignments to current objects. Withmicrowaves being emitted by our very own Milky Way black hole, it could be thatthe microwave background is aligned to current structures because it is beingemitted by them in the here and now!²⁹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3207_0]Time and time again, findings that were puzzling to astrophysicists wereperfectly fitting the black hole principle. The predictions I have outlinedabove can be applied to structures as small as a quark and as unexpected as abrown dwarf.³⁰, [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3209_0] ³¹[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3211_0]So when I found that antimatter was pouring out of our own Milky Way galaxy in averitable fountain, to the surprise of many but totally predictable by thistheory, I realized that too much evidence was accumulating for me to keep thistheory to myself; it needed to get out there.³²[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3213_0] So I collated the data together and publishedit in the book Punk Science, which provides many references for further reading.Since then, of course, we have discovered massive bipolar gamma ray emissionscoming from our own galaxy, too: another iteration of the theory.³³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3215_0]NOTHING NEW UNDER THE BLACK HOLE SUNIt has been a difficult journey, at times requiring me to leave behind thefamiliar life of a medical doctor and step into uncharted territory. Thediscovery of similar theories from groups around the world has just reiteratedthat we are in the middle of a massive scientific revolution. In fact, manyscientists even a hundred years ago were formulating similar theories but didnot have the astrophysics data that we have acquired in the last few decades toexpress them in this way.Going even further back, we realize that the concept that the centers ofgalaxies are a creative force in the universe has been described by many earliercultures. The Maya described the center of the galaxy as the Great Mother orcosmic womb. The gnostics had a creation myth, possibly inherited from earliercultures, that describes a goddess from the center of a galaxy swirling aroundand falling through some sort of cosmic boundary before creating our world.Maybe this knowledge has something to do with spirals appearing in ancient art,such as at New Grange in Ireland.I get a sense that the time for this theory has come and that we are simplyrediscovering what we used to know. Maybe we had to move away from this ancientknowledge in the cycles of time so that we could rediscover it now with thebenefit of our current technologies, which brings us right back to what ourancestors knew—that everything is a spiral of living breathing creative lightfrom infinity occurring at every level and at the heart of every spiral is thesame infinite oneness that connects every structure in the universe from thevery large to the very small."},{"pageContent":"F I V EMEGALITHS, SHAMANS, AND THE CITY BUILDERSTHE HIDDEN CONNECTIONSLUCY WYATTWe all share certain assumptions about the ancient past. There are many commonlyheld presumptions about megaliths, shamans, and city builders. In this article,I challenge those presumptions, as well as explain what the hidden connectionsare and why they are hidden. I provide a brief overview of civilization thatgoes right back to the end of the ice age and so gives an alternativeinterpretation of how living in cities came about—in particular, by exploringthe links between megaliths, shamans, and city builders. This article is basedon research from my book Approaching Chaos.The first point to make is that we do not normally link megaliths and shamanswith city builders. Indeed, there are no ancient cities associated withwell-known megalithic sites in the United Kingdom, such as Avebury orStonehenge. If you mention megalith to anyone, Avebury or Stonehenge arenormally the images that spring to mind; and if you say shamans, then peoplethink of Peruvian medicine men in the jungle or Mongolians in smoke-filledyurts. When we Westerners talk about our ancient pagan “primitive” past, weusually refer to nature and nature spirits, sacred groves of oak trees, templesand zodiacs in the landscape, energy lines, and rocks and springs. We think ofDruids; we think of Stonehenge. It is all wild, elemental, and powerful. We donot think of pharaohs, nor do we think of places like Washington, D.C.—and yetthey are all linked.One reason why we do not make these associations is because of the Romans. They,along with the Greeks, were the most powerful of all the Indo-European tribes,and they continue to dominate us in the West. So much of what we understandabout the ancient past is mediated through these people: it is filtered throughtheir mind-sets, their way of thinking, because we have inherited theirlanguages. They both provide access to the past—because we can learn about lifetwo thousand years ago by reading the material they left behind—and form abarrier.This may sound bizarre, but the Greeks and Romans themselves did not understandeverything about the times they were living in. In fact, they were quite capableof getting it wrong. More particularly, they did not fully understand the groupof people we call the Egyptians—in spite of living with them for several hundredyears.The Greeks, of all the Indo-European tribes, were the closest to the Egyptians,and it is mostly through the Greeks that we know as much as we do about ancientEgypt. But after the end of the fourth century CE, even that possibilitydisappeared, and we lost all ability to read hieroglyphs. For a long time, Egyptremained mysterious, a closed book.So what are these connections that have remained hidden for so long?THE ICE AGETo answer that question, I want to go right back, back to the beginning as itwere—back to the end of the ice age more than twelve thousand years ago. (Thedashed line in figure 5.1 represents the extent of the ice; the other line, thelower sea levels. You can read about the clans in Approaching Chaos.) We tend tostart the story of how civilization began during the ice age; how we came to bemodern, progressive people with all our urban comforts and sophistication,leaving behind the wild, woolly, elemental stuff.[../Images/img0079.jpg]Figure 5.1. Ice age map, reproduced courtesy of Bryan Sykes, The Seven Daughtersof Eve (London: Corgi, 2001)And the story we tell ourselves is that it all starts with the farmingexperiment. You can read about it in the British Museum: Paleolithic man insteadof sitting in his cave begins to throw seeds around outside; he finds he has acrop surplus, and being clever, he decides to exchange it for something else.Primitive people were then on their way to becoming civilized with towns andcities growing out of early marketplaces. They could leave behind theirhunter-gatherer cave-dwelling past and evolve into modern man, with the help ofthe Greeks and Romans, of course. Lots of people continue to believe thatcivilization only really starts with the Greeks and Romans.THE FARMING EXPERIMENT?But unfortunately, we have been telling ourselves the wrong story. This is notwhat the prehistoric record shows. There was no farming experiment. TheNatufians, for instance, who were around from about 12,500 BCE onward,cultivated wild seeds for three thousand years. During this time, there was nochange from a wild seed to a domesticated seed. Even when the change from wildto domesticated did occur after 9,500 BCE, it is not plausible to suggest thatit was an evolutionary process.The difference between wild and domestic seeds is expressed in a single gene:one that relates not to taste but to convenience; convenience being one of thehallmarks of civilization. Figure 5.2 shows a barley seed head with itsrachis—the little hinges that connect the seed heads to the stalk. Wild seedrachis break when the seed heads are ripe; the domestic version waits to bepicked.[../Images/img0021.jpg]Figure 5.2. Barley seed headThe chances of a rare genetic mutant wild cereal turning into domesticatedcereal have been calculated at once or twice in two to four million seedheads—according to Gordon Hillman who is cited by Steve Mithen (a well-respectedprehistorian academic). For this change to have occurred naturally would take 20to 30 cycles, that is 20 to 30 years.¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3219_0] No oneis realistically going to wait around that long for an “experiment” to work;they would return to trapping and say, “Dad, can you forget your farmingexperiment?” The obvious conclusion is that this change was deliberate: someoneknew how to interfere genetically with cereals.What is also suspicious is the climate and geography of those places where thechange to farming apparently took place. One such place is Machu Picchu, high upon the altiplano in the Andes in South America, shown in color plate 3[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1555_0]; another is the Fertile Crescent near theMediterranean Sea—often referred to as the cradle of humanity because so many“firsts” happened here The first fully morphologically domesticated cerealsoccurred at Halula in the northern Euphrates Valley in about 7000 BCE. The mapof the Fertile Crescent in figure 5.3 shows the Taurus Mountains in the west, inTurkey, and the Zagros Mountains in the east, in Iran, with both the Tigris andEuphrates rivers coming from a mountainous area in the middle of the crescent.[../Images/img0024.jpg]Figure 5.3. The Fertile CrescentIf farming really were the stimulus for the creation of civilization, why werethe earliest examples of it located in such agriculturally difficult places?Jacquetta Hawkes is one of the few to draw attention to this curious situationin her comment that civilization “was not inevitable, for on the one hand menhave lived on well-watered and fertile land without creating civilization, andon the other hand they have created civilizations in apparently poorenvironments.”² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3221_0]Hawkes is not alone in her comments. Diana Kirkbride, a onetime director of theBritish School of Archaeology in Iraq, commented about one site dating to 7500BCE that she excavated in the 1970s in the Mosul-Sinjar region in northeasternIraq (in a place called Umm Dabaghiyah) that it was “singularly uninviting”—evenallowing for change over time and degradation of habitats. Likewise, CharlesMaisels discusses another site dating to 6000 BCE to the east of Mosul at YarimTepe on the Upper Zab, describing it as a zone of rocky limestone hillocks “notreally suitable for farming, yet there is plentiful evidence of it here.”³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3223_0]It is also in the Fertile Crescent that we have the remains of a series ofwell-built settlements dating to between the tenth and eighth millennia BCE—themost famous being the end of the eighth millennium at Çatalhüyük in Anatolia,southern Turkey. Çatalhüyük is another site hailed as an example of humanity onits way to a civilized life.What is significant about Çatalhüyük is that well-constructed storerooms are thecentral feature of the settlement—better built than the human dwellings aroundthem. Çatalhüyük is carefully laid out with a proper street pattern and all thehouses have the same floor plan; yet it did not develop into any kind of city.The diet of the inhabitants is also resolutely Stone Age, consisting of wildanimals, aurochs, and such like. This contradicts the idea that farming leads tosurplus, which leads to markets, towns, and so on. None of this makes sense.Here in the Fertile Crescent, we have the earliest evidence not only of farmingbut of metalwork and pottery—not civilization, as such, but the fingerprints ofthe civilizers. So what were they doing in the mountains? I will return to thisquestion later.BRONZE AGE SECONDARY PRODUCTS REVOLUTIONThen, suddenly, around 5000 BCE, the time of the Bronze Age, the first citiesstarted to appear in Mesopotamia (southern Iraq)—about as far away from themountains as is possible in that part of the world. By 3600 BCE, Uruk, forexample, was a great city with over ten thousand people. We know that these arecities because they have the recognizable infrastructure of a city and evidenceof activities like administration and record keeping. These skills are notinnate. We only have to look at our own modern difficulties with teachingwell-known civilized techniques like writing to know that even after thousandsof years of civilization, these skills have to be retaught.And coincidently, not just cities appeared, but something happened in farmingtoo—what the archaeologists call the secondary products revolution. It is aroundthis time that people milked cows (and made butter and cheese), plowed the soil,rode horses, took wool from sheep, planted vines, and so on—the kind of farmingthat we would all recognize. Before this moment in time, it was not possible totake wool from a sheep: sheep had coats like deer, even though there is evidenceof sheep/goat ovricaprids having been eaten by humans as far back as 10,500 BCE.How odd and how useful that, just when lots of people start to live in cities,the production of food becomes more organized. This shift had to be deliberatebecause no self-respecting hunter-gatherer would give up providing for himselfand his family to live in a city until he could be sure that he could rely onsomeone else for food production and that he had a skill that would be useful ina city.In particular, farming skills had to be taught. Farming is not natural. Anyonewho thinks it is easy should try it. The hunter-gatherer was not used to stayingin one place; he followed the herd. He was more used to killing than keepingstock alive, especially through the winter. Farming is a completely differentskill set that requires knowledge of the soil and the calendar.What is notable is that people did not make the transition from nomadichunter-gatherer to nomadic pastoralist. The shift to farming always involved asettled pattern first, usually identified by the presence of pigs, which cannotbe herded long distance. Take the example of the Ferghana Valley in CentralAsia, which is in the eastern part of Uzbekistan and is famous today for itsKirghiz tribes who herd massive flocks of sheep over long distances. Theevidence of older patterns of Bronze Age farming, the Chust culture—which can beseen in the museum in Tashkent, capital city of Uzbekistan—is still of thesettled pattern first.What this suggests to me is that the early farmers were not necessarilyhunter-gatherers who took up farming because of some environmental change orother external pressure. They were actually a different people with a differentknowledge base. First cereals were genetically interfered with, and thenanimals. This was not a natural evolutionary process. Even Julius Caesar knewthat aurochs could not be domesticated. In any case, how would Neolithic manknow what would make a “good” cow, just from observing them at waterholes?I would argue that this change in farming happened because of cities and not theother way round. The first evidence of a city’s existence isn’t a marketplacebut a shrine. One of the oldest cities in southern Mesopotamia, Eridu, has ashrine dating to 2000 BCE that has seventeen layers underneath it that possiblygo back as far as 5000 BCE. Hawkes has also commented that the key group ofpeople who are involved in cities from the start are not farmers but priests.So, what has this got to do with megaliths and shamans? The connection lies inwhat these cities represent as a total concept of civilization—a concept inwhich megaliths and shamans were an integral part. Cities did not develop out offarming but arrived as pre-planned artificial constructs on the landscape. Theyhave identifiable characteristics that link them to a specific archetype, whichincludes the knowledge of how to move big stones and has shamanic ritual at theheart of it.THE TOTAL CIVILIZATION CONCEPTI refer to this archetype as the Ur concept of civilization. The Egyptianscalled it living in ma’at or truth—the goddess Ma’at having the feather oftruth. But I prefer Ur, which in this context doesn’t just mean the famous citythat Sir Leonard Woolley excavated in the 1920s in southern Iraq (and in myopinion mistakenly identified as the biblical Ur of the Chaldees, as I have goodreason to believe that was another Ur elsewhere); Ur in this context has ameaning of foundation and as such can be found in names like Jerusalem(oru-shalem or foundation of peace).The best way to describe this Ur concept is to imagine a color wheel plus white.The archetype was based on all the usual aspects we attribute to civilized cityliving: straightness, accuracy precision, balance, design, infrastructure,organization.If there is one part of the circle that is more important than any other, it isthe temple at the center, which holds all the other parts in balance. It was thepriesthood that supervised the foundation of cities, the construction of thegreat engineering works and monumental architecture. It was they who sanctionedthe trading exchanges, determined the calendar and predicted the weather,educated the young, kept written records, and healed the sick and helped thedying on their way. They understood the importance of the soul (the psyche) andits role in reincarnation and immortality. Were they also the ones who bred wildanimals into domesticated versions?[../Images/img0089.jpg]Figure 5.4. The Ur concept of civilizationThere are also the relationships across the wheel: all forms of communication(trade, travel, and education), the individual body (the art of cooking, and thelink between food and medicine), agriculture (domestication of animals andorganized arable production), and power. Power in this context refers topolitical power (administration, justice, architecture, and infrastructure) andreligious power (the priesthood). The critical role is the melchizedek orpriest-king.This archetype exists for all time and in all places, which is why the samecharacteristics appear in the Near East as in the Indus Valley, in Phoenicia, inMinoan Crete, and in Central and South America (and possibly the Far East—but Ihaven’t explored that aspect). Egypt, with its pharaohs, became the best exampleof it.PROTO-INDO EUROPEANSBut what is truly extraordinary about the Ur concept is the confirmation ofaspects of it among people who themselves were not civilized and who can befound living a long way away from the civilizers. They did not even live incities. These people are the very early Indo-European tribes long before theycame to Europe, the Proto-Indo-Europeans.The location of the original homeland of the Indo-Europeans before the fourthmillennium BCE is controversial. There is no universal agreement. My ownpersonal view is that it was in the Pontic Caspian in the Ukraine—a long wayaway from the civilizers in Mesopotamia. And yet, there is evidence, based on ananalysis of ProtoIndo-European language, that the civilizers came into contactwith these early Indo-Europeans.It is now a well-established idea that the Indo-European tribes (Celts, Romans,Greeks, and so on) once all lived together. What linguists have worked out isthat Indo-Europeans last lived together over five thousand years ago—a timeframe that relates to the Bronze Age civilizers. This link was discoveredthrough the realization in the nineteenth century that Indian Sanskrit, althoughwritten in a different alphabet, has the same language roots as other Europeanlanguages, such as Latin and Greek.Etymology reveals what kind of environment they knew; what kind of dwellingsthey lived in; what skills they had; and, to a limited extent, what theythought. And, in my opinion, certain concepts that relate to the Ur civilizationarchetype have been embedded in the language for more than 5,000 years—2,500years before they lived in cities.Contact with civilizers is implied in that the Indo-Europeans knew about bronzeand copper but not about tin, which suggests that they did not know how to makebronze but got bronze from elsewhere. They also picked up from the civilizersover five thousand years ago practical farming skills and benefited from thesecondary products revolution. They knew about stock breeding; evidence ofdomesticated sheep and cattle and herding can be reconstructed and attributed toProto-Indo-European, as can the secondary products of butter and cheese.There is a very good reason why the civilizers would want to make contact withthe early Indo-Europeans. There was a certain something thatProto-Indo-Europeans had, which the civilizers were keen to exchange skills andideas for. It was this certain something that I think establishes theProto-Indo-Europeans in a distinct time and place, and that something was thewild horse or the tarpan. The Indo-Europeans lived in the range of the tarpan.[../Images/img0081.jpg]Figure 5.5. The Proto-Indo-European homelandUntil the arrival of the civilizers, who knew how to genetically interfere withwild creatures for the benefit of humans, the tarpan had been of little use tothe Proto-Indo-Europeans. The first domestic horse bones are usually claimed tobe those dating from 4000 BCE, found at the Dereivka site in the Sdreny Stogregion of the Ukraine. The breakthrough in the exploitation of the deep steppedid not happen until about 3500 BCE, and the first wheeled carts did not appearon the steppes north of the Black Sea and Caspian before 3000 BCE.The civilizers would have brought horses down from the Ukraine, and although itwas long before horses made an obvious impact on Mesopotamia, within a certainperiod of time there is evidence of their use. By 2800 BCE, 80 percent ofSumerians lived in cities and had wheeled carts.The shift from wild to domestic horses had such an impact on theProto-Indo-Europeans that they venerated the horse for thousands of years. Theyattributed godlike powers to them. Their attitude to religion was simple andnature based (sky god and earth mother). A term for religion can bereconstructed from creed based on two words, cre dhe, meaning “put into yourheart.”One concept that particularly demonstrates the impact of the civilizers and isinexplicable to linguists is the concept of king (reg), which can bereconstructed to the earliest level of Proto-Indo-European language (rex, raj,reich). This is a remarkable concept as it underpins the rules, regulation, andaccuracy aspect of the archetype. But at the time they learned this word, theIndo-Europeans were wild warlike tribes living in mud huts, where the centralfocus was the hearth. Linguists are forced to give the ridiculous explanation oftwo kings: one for war and one for ruling. Is it possible that theIndo-Europeans picked up a word that they did not understand the full meaningof?GLOBAL CATASTROPHE: FOURTH MILLENNIUM BCEThen, around 3159 BCE, there was an appalling environmental catastrophe, whichresulted in a massive migration of all peoples—the Proto-Indo-Europeans and thecivilizers among them. It is after this catastrophe that ancient Egypt as weknow it begins. At this point, the Proto-Indo-Europeans split up into theirindividual tribes, and the civilizers had no further common impact on them,although bits of knowledge remained with the individual tribes.Celts, for example, went the farthest west, ending up in Ireland, and far to theeast in the Tarim basin on the west of China, where they became Tocharians, tallfour-thousand-year-old ginger-haired mummies wearing tartan have been found inthe Chinese Taklamakhan desert.⁴ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3225_0] The languageof the Celts, who went the farthest, retains the most archaisms, and thereforemore connections with Indians and Sythians, and is possibly the mostinteresting.[../Images/img0100.jpg]Figure 5.6. DiasporaTo give one example, the Celts possibly retained knowledge of the gods of thecivilizers. They continued to refer to Tetates, one of the old names of Thoth,the Egyptian god of writing, when the Greeks and Romans had already changed himto Hermes and Mercury. The implication of this Celtic reference is that Egyptiandeities could have been known to the Proto-Indo-Europeans before the start ofEgypt. The name Hermes is in itself worth noting, as its root is possibly ur-mesmeaning son of Ur (mes or mos are Egyptian words that mean “son of,” as inThutmosis, a pharaoh name that means “son of Thoth”).But in spite of the close proximity of the Proto-Indo-Europeans with thecivilizers, there is no obvious evidence that they knew about shamanism in orderto access the metaphysical secrets of the original archetype—which is perhapswhy they never built cities themselves until much later. Even though theconcepts of shaman and shamanism are well known, how they relate to civilizationis less familiar.SHAMANIC RITUAL AND ROLE OF THE PHARAOHIn essence, a shaman is someone who has an out-of-body experience in which he orshe undergoes a journey as a spirit on behalf of a person or a community inorder to find answers to particular questions. The kind of shamanism that ispracticed these days is more usually on behalf of a sick person or child toidentify remedies that will cure the patient. It is important to understand thatthe information thus obtained is not discoverable through experimentation, as itoften involves the use of poisons that have to be treated in a particular wayfirst, otherwise they would be fatal.These shamanic journeys are trancelike, dangerous, frightening, near-deathexperiences that can result in the actual death of the shaman. They are,therefore, to be avoided by anyone who is not properly trained or prepared (oneof the problems with modern drug taking is that it can result in mental damagefrom ignorant use). The initiation or training of the shaman is thus criticalfrom an early age. In addition, the preparation of the substance that brings onthe trance is key to the whole process.How this applies to the original archetype of civilization is that the king hadthe responsibility of undertaking the special journey on behalf of his people.In the case of Egypt, that person was the pharaoh; this title, interestinglyenough, could be a Greek corruption of the words per ur, the name of the placewhere the pharaoh’s initiation took place (per ur means “house of foundation”),which might have been at Nekhen (or Hierakonopolis, its Greek name), possibly inits mysterious fort, which had no defensive purpose.Every forty years, the pharaoh prepared for a highly important festival,sometimes referred to as the pharaoh’s jubilee, or the Heb Sed Festival. Thefestival incorporated the Osirian rites—a reenactment of the death of the godOsiris and his revival at the hands of Isis, his wife—and took took place in apurpose-built courtyard adjacent to a specially constructed pyramid. There werepublic aspects and secret aspects. Citizens from all over Egypt came to thefestival, and the purpose of it was to rededicate the country to civilization.[../Images/img0012.jpg]Figure 5.7. Pharaoh riding a serpentIn the public aspects, the pharaoh wore a special bull kilt and had to runaround the courtyard. He also participated in a ritual meal called the hotep.After this meal, the pharaoh disappeared into the secret part of the festival,which took place inside the pyramid, where he entered the realm of the deitySokar.Sokar is interesting because of what he represents. Sokar had a more complicatedassociation with death than just being dead. He was part of a triplemanifestation of the gods Ptah-Sokar-Osiris. These gods represented the triplepowers of animation, incarnation, and restoration, and thus were essential tothe Egyptian ideas of cycles of life and death, in terms of the soul beingimmortal and reincarnated in a living body.Writer Rosemary Clark describes Sokar as representing “the latent spiritualprinciple within all living things, the spirit embedded in the deepest regionsof matter that await arousal,” a description that implies the beginning of liferather than the end of it.PYRAMIDS—NOT TOMBSIt is our cultural problem that we think of pyramids as tombs. Very few deadbodies have ever been found in them. The Egyptians buried their dead either inthe royal tombs on the west bank of the Nile opposite Luxor or in mudbrickmastabas. The Egyptian word for pyramid is mr, which has the idea of aninstrument for ascending, according to American Egyptologist Mark Lehner, whotranslates mr as “place of ascension” according to his belief that the pyramidswere tombs for dead kings and where the dead kings souls ascended. A closeexamination of the structure of the Great Pyramid at Giza reveals another clueto their function.First, some statistics: The Great Pyramid covers thirteen acres. It is built of2.3 million blocks of solid rock with an average weight of 2 tons per block;some blocks weigh 50 tons. The four corners are true 90-degree angles to withinone one-hundredth of an inch. It is aligned on the cardinal points and deviatesby only 5 degrees.What is remarkable about this pyramid is that it has clearly been constructedvery carefully and deliberately, and it is devoid of any kind of internaldecoration or ornamentation; whereas the mastaba tombs at Saqqara arebeautifully decorated with the most exquisite bas-reliefs of life scenes thatwould help a pharaoh on his way in the afterlife.Consider the most important chamber in the Great Pyramid: the King’s Chamber. Anenormous effort was made to bring extraordinary granite slabs—megaliths thatweighed up to fifty tons—five hundred miles from the quarry in Aswan. And thenthese slabs were used in the chamber in such a way that their function was notvisually obvious. Furthermore, the chamber is deliberately constructed so thatits walls and its ceiling are not connected. The ceiling is supported by wallsbeyond the internal walls. Above the ceiling are a series of hidden granitebeams with bits taken out of them.[../Images/img0103.jpg]Figure 5.8. Cross-section of the Great PyramidOne plausible explanation for all of this is that the purpose of the chamber wasto create an electrical field using vibration. The quartz in the granite haspiezo-electric properties. The reason for not tying the walls to the ceiling wasso that they could vibrate freely, and the explanation for the gouges in thebeams above the ceiling could have been for fine-tuning the resonances.*2[../Text/ch23.html#anchor_3066_0]By way of reinforcing this idea of vibration in an electrical field, the pharaoheither lay in a sarcophagus of alabaster or granite or on a special Heb SedFestival bed covered in gold leaf (Tut’s golden bed can be seen in the Cairomuseum)—gold being a good conductor of electricity.Before doing this, the pharaoh put on the qeni garment over his chest andparticipated in the Wepwawet Opening of the Mouth Ceremony. Was the point ofusing the qeni garment, which the pharaoh described as the embrace of Osiris, toprotect the pharaoh’s heart from the electrical field? And was the Opening ofthe Mouth Ceremony to stop him from swallowing his tongue during his trance?What confirms my suspicions that this was all part of a shamanic ritual are thePyramid or Coffin texts. These texts were discovered in the nineteenth centuryby Flinders Petrie, the Victorian archaeologist. Again it is our culturalproblem that we think of them as describing the journey of the pharaoh’s soulafter death, whereas it is more likely that they describe his soul’s journey inlife. Dr. Jeremy Naydler, an Oxford academic, is one of the few who has come tothis conclusion.The Pyramid Texts frequently refer to the pharaoh taking the form of a bird andflying up or climbing a ladder. Chapter XX of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, forinstance, talks of the pharaoh rising into the sky like the mighty hawk. TheAntechamber Texts in the Pyramid of Unas at Saqqara refer to “a stairway to thesky [which] is set up for me that I may ascend on it to the sky, and I ascend onthe smoke of the great censing. I fly up as a bird.” Elsewhere, the same textsrefer to the pharaoh flying up in the form of a falcon to the “imperishablenorthern stars”—an important point I shall come back to.⁵[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3227_0]ALCHEMY AND THE SOLAR BREADIf this was a shamanic experience, was the hotep meal the means by which thepharaoh brought on a trance? A significant element of the meal was the solarbread. And there are references to the solar bread in the Pyramid Texts. OnePyramid Text, which Naydler describes as an enigmatic food spell, is anutterance for the offering bread to fly up.So what was the solar bread? This essential ingredient of the Hetep meal clearlyhad special properties. This is where the story gets really interesting. It isat this point that the Greeks, through whom we know as much as we do, gotconfused. They confused a process with an outcome; as a result, we know aboutthe process without being aware of its purpose and that process was what we callalchemy.Have we been misled about alchemy? Maybe alchemy isn’t the changing of anothermetal into gold, or even a spiritual transformation, but the purification ofgold to achieve an even purer gold (the four-thousand-year-old Mesopotamiangolden ram caught in a thicket—now in the British Museum—is an example of verypure gold). There are several methods for achieving purification, and one ofthem is to expose gold to a high electrical charge to remove impurities. It isalso possible to use this process to turn pure gold into a white powder withlevitational properties.[../Images/img0036.jpg]Figure 5.9. The golden ramThe usual source for the word alchemy is khem, which is the description of Egyptas the black land, but this definition doesn’t work in this context. What makesmore sense, to me at least, is that alchemy is derived from khemi, the Egyptianword for the fixed stars, and so alchemy means a journey to the fixed stars orthe imperishable northern stars. The Egyptians possibly used the levitationalproperties of the white powder in the form of solar bread as their means ofentering a trance.Because of the Greeks’ misunderstanding, we use the term to identify only onepart of the process, the means by which the Egyptians made that journey—thepreparation of the gold. The Greeks were ignorant of the outcome, the astralflight to the fixed stars. The circumstantial evidence that confirms myinterpretation that the preparation of the gold was key to the whole operationis the link between the solar bread—the substance consumed during the hotep, thepharaoh’s ritual meal—and the cow goddess Hathor.HATHOR AND GOLDHathor the cow goddess had many roles, mostly to do with nurturing. She issometimes attributed with lending her cow horns to the goddess Isis when tendingthe infant Horus. Hathor is also the one who nurtures the soul of the pharaoh onhis journey.[../Images/img0030.jpg]Figure 5.10. Hathor the cow goddessEven more significantly, it is in her temple at Serabit el-Khadim in the SinaiPeninsula where, in the nineteenth century, Flinders Petrie found vastquantities of a mysterious white powder hidden under slabs in the floor.Furthermore, another of her names is Nub-t, the word for gold, and herconnection with gold is obvious at her temple at Denderah on the Nile, which hasthe hieroglyph of gold on its back wall. It is in the Denderah temple wherethere are the strange “lightbulb” reliefs in the crypt.Mouni Sadhu, who wrote a fundamental work on the tarot in the late 1950s,alludes to the role of electricity in his summary of a typical alchemicalprocess, albeit repeating the widespread deception that gold results from othermetals.Sadhu notes that “[i]n order to transform another metal into silver or gold, wemust first destroy the imperfect combination of its components, that is toseparate the subtle from the gross in that metal, and then to establish a new,perfect combination, passive or active. . . . The Emerald Tablets speak aboutthis separation of the subtle from the gross.” Sadhu goes on to explain in moredetail the stages that an alchemist might follow to create the philosopher’sstone, which he identifies as being a powder.⁶ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3229_0]The first phase is the preparation of the “universal solvent” or mercury using amineral called the “magnesia of the sages.” The second phase is the operation,which produces a “dazzling white color” after slow heating in the athanor (thealchemist’s oven). There are several points to note in his account: his viewthat the philosopher’s stone is a powder; that the universal solvent is calledthe magnesia of the sages, which he later identifies as some kind of electricalcharge; and the specific description of the powder being a dazzling white color.Is this the powder that Flinders Petrie discovered in the Hathor temple atSerabit el-Khadim?[../Images/img0057.jpg]Figure 5.11. Reliefs in the crypt at DenderahWriter Lawrence Gardner also describes the electrical process of purifying gold,which results in a white powder with levitational properties. According toGardner, when the molecular structure of the gold changes, some of its matterturns into energy and becomes pure light. Not only does the powder weigh lessthan the original metal, but it is capable of transferring some loss of weightto the container in which it was originally weighed.SNAKES COMMUNICATING WITH DNASo, now we have all the ingredients. There remains one more piece of the jigsawpuzzle to add: What was it that the pharaoh was communicating with? Who were thenetr, the Egyptian gods? Were they sometimes giant snakes? And is it justcoincidence that netr, the Egyptian word for god, is identical to aProto-Indo-European word for snake, also netr (natrix in Lation; nathir in OldIrish; and naeddre in Old English, where it became adder). Is that the reasonthat Thoth or Hermes is associated with the twin snakes of the caduceus?The modern experience of Jeremy Narby, which he describes in his book The CosmicSerpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge, provides some corroboration.⁷[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3231_0] Narby traveled to the Peruvian Amazon in 1985to study a native community, the Quirishari, as part of his Ph.D. inanthropology from Stanford University. Here he undertook a shamanic experienceusing the ayahuasca vine in which a pair of enormous snakes communicated withhim. What particularly struck Narby was the visual parallel between the image ofentwined snakes, such as in the caduceus, and that of the double helix of DNA.Narby then came to the fascinating conclusion that the parallel was more thanvisual: it was actual. Shamans, he concluded, were communicating at the level ofmolecular biology, of DNA itself. He was surprised to discover in the technicalliterature that the shape of the double helix of DNA is “most often described asa ladder . . . or a spiral staircase,” which compares with the worldwidefrequent references made to climbing a ladder during a shamanic trance.Narby thus discovered how native people acquired their knowledge of medicinalplants. These plants were often highly toxic and required critical specialpreparation before use; otherwise, they would kill you before you had chance toexperiment with them and find out their healing properties. Native people knewprecisely which plants to choose out of eighty thousand Amazonian plant species.And the means by which they knew this nonempirical knowledge, he was told andpersonally experienced, was through shamanism.[../Images/img0065.jpg]Figure 5.12. Thoth as Hermes with caduceusPHARAOHS—SOPHISTICATED SHAMANSWhat the pharaohs of ancient Egypt were doing was much more sophisticated thanthe Peruvian jungle version. And knowing the importance of gold to the wholeprocess also explains why civilization appears to start in mountains—that iswhere the gold is. Çatalhüyük was part of a supply chain of emporia to supportoperations elsewhere in the mountains, and so the storerooms for this emporiawere better constructed than the human dwellings; these storerooms were moreimportant than how the locals lived.Mesopotamia had no gold reserves, and yet its ancient name of kien-gi translatesas “land where gold is king.” Mesopotamian gold came from the Fertile Crescent.The hairs stood on the back of my neck when I realized that the sites where theearliest pottery was found in the Fertile Crescent are near gold mines andimportant routes for gold.The links between megaliths (the ability to move massive stones weighing fiftytons or more over vast distances and hundreds of miles), shaman (wise men whocan take their souls on journeys for the benefit of others at great personalrisk to themselves), and the original cities should now be clear; they are allintegral to each other.We don’t realize any of this because of the barrier the Greeks and Romanscreated for us—a barrier that grew even greater after the Romans came under theinfluence of a monotheistic religion we call Christianity from the fourthcentury CE onward. I would personally argue that it was at that point thatcivilization collapsed, and that we have been living in a dark age ever since,struggling to reconnect with the original archetype that appeared in the BronzeAge over five thousand years ago.ROMANO-CHRISTIAN DESTRUCTIONIt was in the fourth century CE that fanatical Romano-Christians massacred thelast Egyptian priests at the temple of Isis on the Island of Philae in the UpperNile. These same people destroyed the site of the Eleusian mysteries in Greecenear Athens in 396 CE and burnt down the famous library at Alexandria in 415 CE,brutally murdering Hypatia, its last priestess.The Egyptians had realized long before that the writing, as it were, was on thewall and that the end lay ahead. The shift that marked the start of Egypt’s longdecline was the change from Bronze Age to Iron Age in about 1200 BCE,characterized by the fall of Troy. It was at this time that the Hekla volcano inIceland erupted in 1159 BCE, causing twenty years of poor harvests, famine, andappalling social destruction, including a form of child sacrifice.There is a particularly sad prophecy in the Hermetica:If truth were told, our land is the temple of the whole world; . . . a time willcome when . . . . Egypt will be abandoned. The land that was the seat ofreverence will be widowed by the powers and left destitute of their presence.When foreigners occupy the land and territory, not only will reverence fall intoneglect, but . . . a prohibition . . . will be enacted against reverence,fidelity and divine worship. Then this most holy land, seat of shrines andtemples, will be filled completely with tombs and corpses . . . only storieswill survive and they will be incredible to your children. Only words cut instone will survive to tell your faithful works. . . . Whoever survives will berecognized as Egyptian only by his language; in his actions he will seem aforeigner.⁸ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3233_0]Egypt had become increasingly vulnerable to invasion, which happened first withthe Persians in about 600 BCE, followed by the Greeks under Alexander the Greatin 333 BCE. The Romans, who were so desperate to get hold of Egypt, did notsucceed until 30 BCE, at the time of Anthony and Cleopatra. Before the arrivalof Alexander, the Egyptians had decided to open themselves up a little to theGreeks from about 500 BCE onward—which explains why all of a sudden the Greeksknew everything (mathematics, geometry, geography, medicine). Pythagoras, forexample, is reckoned to have spent twenty-five years in Egyptian temples beingtaught. He was not the only Greek to do so.When the Romano-Christians killed the last Egyptian priests at the temple ofIsis in 394 CE, all knowledge of hieroglyphs was lost to be rediscovered fifteenhundred years later in the nineteenth century, with the translation of theRosetta stone by Frenchman Champollion. As a result, one means of accessingEgyptian wisdom and knowledge was soon forgotten. By the end of the fourthcentury CE, the Romano-Christians had symbolically and literally cut us off fromthe ancient past. Not surprising, then, that we knew nothing about the shamanicritual of the pharaohs or the connections between megaliths and cities.The Egyptians were especially keen that their secrets should not fall into Romanhands. The Romans were powerful enough as it was, but they never knew how tomove the big stones. And if anyone still falls for the explanation thatmegaliths are moved by teams of slaves, then they need to consider the pointthat Rome was the ultimate in slave society and still couldn’t move megaliths.The Romans had to invent the pulley and mortar for constructing their largebuildings. Roman building is either smaller dressed stone or many bricks laid ona spectacular scale.ROMAN POWERWe might mistakenly think that the fourth-century massacre on the Island ofPhilae occurred because the Christianized Romans saw the light and realized theneed to eliminate pagan practices. The truth is, however, that the Romans hadbeen attacking pagans for years before they converted to Christianity.The military campaigns that the Romans waged against pagans all had something incommon: Those pagans all knew about aspects of the original archetype ofcivilization. The Romans threw out the Pythagoreans; they banned alchemy; theyinvaded Britain to destroy the Druids; they fought in central Turkey to destroythe Chaldean Magi; and they attacked the Essenes at Qumran on the Dead Sea. Allthis happened long before Christians infiltrated the Roman state.Indeed, Constantine decided to adopt Christianity in the fourth century CEbecause he could see the political advantages of it. The Romans were used touniting behind the glory of Rome, and now they could use religion and the oneGod as another tool of unification. This monotheistic religion then became auseful weapon for attacking those pagan pockets that had metaphysical secretsthat were denied to the Romans. And so it was that the connections betweenmegaliths, shamans, and cities were hidden for such a long time and perhapsneeded to be—given that the knowledge was for peaceful purposes only. Alchemywas the missing link.The secret knowledge did not entirely die out after Egypt collapsed but went upthe trade routes, appropriately to the northern Euphrates to Harran, where itwas kept alive by alchemists and a people known as the Sabians. The story of howwe gradually began to reconnect with that hidden knowledge is explained in moredetail in my book Approaching Chaos. I hope I have managed to give a briefoverview of the connections between megaliths, shamans, and city builders—whythey are hidden and why we have not realized them until now."},{"pageContent":"S I XATLANTIS AND THE CYCLES OF TIMEJOSCELYN GODWINEver since Plato described his Atlantis, many authors have claimed to have foundit. Some say it was in the Atlantic Ocean, with the Azores as its formermountain peaks. Others prefer the Mediterranean: Malta, Crete, Cyprus,Santorini, and Troy all have their champions. British Atlantologists find itslegacy in Cornwall or the Irish Sea; Germans, in the sinking isle of Helgoland;Swedes, in Sweden. Some favor the Arctic, others the Antarctic. Still othersturn to the New World, finding Atlantis in Cuba, San Domingo, Central America,Bolivia, even Wisconsin. All these authors must have finished their books with aserene smile and the certainty that they, and they alone, had put a stakethrough the heart of the matter. The fact that it now looks like a pincushiongives one pause. Since these theories cannot all be right, it is quite probablethat many are wrong.So I search for Atlantis in a different way. To begin, I see a wiser group thattakes a global perspective. Rather than planting the Atlantean flag in a singlelocation, it finds evidence in the worldwide “fingerprints of the gods” for aprehistoric seafaring culture, expert in mathematics and astronomy and given tomoving large stones. Some of the particularists, to give them their due, findtheir place as contributors to this broader vision. Plato aside, each has foundsomething of value and added in some way to knowledge of the distant past.Anyone who keeps abreast of the “new archaeology” is well aware of all this. Heor she may also have noticed that the new archaeology has a New Age aura aboutit. Among its prime movers, Colin Wilson is one of the most popular authors onoccult traditions. John Anthony West has written a defense of astrology and anexposition of the Hermetic adept Schwaller de Lubicz. Graham Hancock writesabout experiences with entheogens. Robert Bauval’s theories touch equally onHermetic doctrines of astral immortality. Robert Schoch is concerned withparapsychological research. However, their prime material is still the monumentsthemselves; their prime intent, to understand why they are as they are. The onlyexplanation that satisfies them is that prehistoric peoples experienced statesof being incomprehensible through the materialist paradigm. The reasonablecourse, then, is to try a different paradigm.Another type of Atlantologist has been doing this all along, by taking asuprarational approach to the question of prehistoric high culture. It is wrongto call them irrational, because they do not reject reason. However, theyconsider other avenues of knowledge supplementary if not superior to it. Thetraditionally minded put their faith in scriptures and sacred authorities, whilethose open to the paranormal rely on intuition, initiation, clairvoyance, ormediumship. One might call them occultists, but only in the sense that they allclaim access to knowledge that is “occulted” or hidden from the rationalists.The occultists’ Atlantis is a colorful and often beautiful tapestry, woven byvisionaries, prophets, and receivers of divine revelation. But I cannot leave itat that. I want to turn the tapestry over to see how the knots are made, thensnoop around in their workrooms.One of the first facts to emerge is that there are distinct national schools.The first Atlantologists of the modern age were two Frenchmen of theEnlightenment—the astronomer Jean-Sylvain Bailly and the theosopher Fabred’Olivet. Together, they launched a particularly French strain, carried onwardby Saint-Yves d’Alveydre, Edouard Schuré, Papus (Gerard Encausse), René Guénon,and Paul le Cour. After World War II, this spawned a more popular genre withLouis Pauwels’s and Jacques Bergier’s Morning of the Magicians, the reviewPlanète, and the books of Robert Charroux, who blended it with the ancientastronaut theory.[../Images/img0058.jpg]Figure 6.1. The heart crest, a representation of the French view of Atlantis,has a map at its center showing the location of the lost continent.The French Atlantologists tend to give information ex cathedra, keeping theirsources to themselves, as though what they have to say about prehistory isobvious to any reasonable person. Reason does not exclude immaterial or evenspiritual realities, but once these are accepted as part of the natural order ofthings, certain consequences follow. From the start, they envisaged prehistoryin a context of the variously colored races (yellow, red, black, white), towhich they attribute separate origins. Each arose on a different continent or,according to some, on a different planet. This is a constant of Frenchoccultism, together with the caution that no race is deemed superior or inferiorto the others. One of the later writers, Jean Phaure, says that we are all ofmixed blood, but “whether we are yellow, white, black, or red, we possess thatfragment of the divine Spirit that makes us humans and not animals.”¹[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3237_0]The Germanic strain of Atlantology is rather different, and its earlierproponents have harmed our subject, and occultism in general, by association.The Ariosophists of the pre-Nazi era were racial supremacists, and theirAtlantean theories conformed to that outlook. In 1904, Lanz von Liebenfels, a“new templar,” set the trend in his Theozoologie, writing of how the tall, whiterace of Atlantis interbred with apes. The result was a hybrid race of “sodomiticapelings” that survived into classical times and left its genetic stain inalmost all of us. Lanz’s solution was a rigid eugenics program that would, intime, breed out the animal element, though he added that purified humanity wouldstill need some subhuman creatures as slaves. Few of the Ariosophists veered sofar toward the lunatic fringe as von Liebenfels, but none of them challenged hisauthority.After the German defeat in World War I, Ariosophical doctrines were in place tocomfort the battered German soul and hold out a glorious future for it. Here isone version of the myth, which I paraphrase from Hermann Wieland’s Atlantis,Edda und Bibel: The Arctic region, where a temperate vegetation flourished, washome to the Aryans, a blond, blue-eyed, brachycephalic race. They lived therehappily until a regularly recurring alteration of the earth’s axis brought on anice age, then were forced to migrate southward. Leaving their polar homeland,the Aryans settled on the island-continent of Atlantis, setting up a twelvefoldnation that would later become the model for the zodiac and the divisions oftime by hours and months. They were forbidden to kill animals and lived wheneverpossible as vegetarians, unlike the lower races who already inhabited the landand were little better than beasts themselves. The Edda and both Testaments ofthe Bible are really chronicles of the Aryans’ history. Whenever the Biblespeaks of Beasts, it refers to lower races, as do all the laws of Moses andinjunctions of Jesus.² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3239_0]Readers of my earlier book Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, andNazi Survival will be familiar with much of this and with later developments.³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3241_0]Germanic Atlantology also included some who were caught against their will inthe maelstrom of events. Herman Wirth, for instance, was busy with his owntheory of a prehistoric Arctic culture that left its symbols in petroglyphsthroughout the circumpolar regions. Anticipating later anthropologists likeMarija Gimbutas, Wirth believed that this was a matriarchal society and that thetrouble began later with patriarchy and its aggressive monotheistic religions.Wirth was co-opted by the Ahnenerbe (the think tank of the Schutzstaffel or SS)because his theories superficially seemed to support the Nordic-Aryan myth, buthe disappointed them. Himmler fired him, and Wirth was forbidden to publish forthe remainder of the Third Reich.One who managed to keep out of trouble was the little-known occultist known asPeryt Shou. His career spanned both world wars, during which he ran a small andsecretive group, teaching methods for regaining one’s spiritual birthrightthrough a mixture of astrology, posture, and mantra. He wrote two books onAtlantis and is probably the first to have seen any significance in the namesPlato gives for the ten Atlantean kings. He analyzes them into their phoneticcontents and tabulates their correspondences with star names, the Egyptiandecans, the Sephiroth of the Kabbalah, the antediluvian patriarchs of Genesis,and the multiples and divisions of the “mother number” 432.⁴[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3243_0][../Images/img0090.jpg]Figure 6.2. German map of the AtlanticShou’s object was to retrieve the spiritual awareness and autonomy that werelost with the fall of Atlantis. In his words, “Man forms himself, createshimself, for he possesses the divine guardian, the angel in his breast, whowatches lest he thereby violate the divine law. . . . In the course of hisdevelopment, man grew ever further from this primordial religion. He believedthat the Godhead was there to care for him, and so he should entrust everythingto it. . . .Through the Fall, man lost the right to free self-determination. Hehad to lean on God for everything and thereby forgot that God burned with itsholiest rays in his own breast.”⁵ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3245_0]After Germany’s second defeat, anything occult was shunned owing to itsassociations, real or attributed, with the Third Reich. Rare exceptions wereRudolf Steiner’s Anthroposophic movement, which was obviously innocent of anycomplicity with Nazism, and the Externsteine circle. This was founded in the1960s by Walther Machalett, a schoolteacher enthralled by the genii loci(spirits of place) and by a theory of prehistoric geodesy (earth measurement).His scheme linked Atlantis and the pyramids with the Externsteine, anawe-inspiring natural formation in northwest Germany. Meeting each year onAscension Day in the shadow of those towering rocks, the Machalett forum bringstogether psychics and engineers, scholars and eccentrics, in a nondogmaticexploration of prehistoric cultures and Earth mysteries.Each of the major strains of occult Atlantology has its own style. The Germansare more indebted to theosophy and its concept of root races (see below), whichthe Ariosophists developed in one direction, the Anthroposophists in another.They almost never claim supersensible powers themselves but believe that suchexisted in ancient times and may be revived in the future. The third majornational strain is the British, which differs from the French and German by itsopenness about its methods and the great variety of them.From Britain, we have accounts of Atlantis from self-trained trance mediums(Dion Fortune, Margaret Lumley Brown); dictation by an inner voice (H. C.Randall-Stevens); visions of the past induced by meditating at an ancient site(Paul Brunton); open-eyed visions onsite by a medium (Olive Pixley); manuscriptsmade available during initiation into an arcane order (Lewis Spence); adiscarnate entity who takes the subject on a tour (Daphne Vigers); the return ofa well-known nineteenth-century medium (Mandasoran); another medium who acts asmouthpiece for his controlling entity (Anthony Neate); a person who has a singleflash of inspired vision from which she develops a system (Katharine Maltwood);an enthusiast for outlandish theories who constructs his own eclectic model(Brinsley Le Poer Trench); and another whose enthusiasms lead to a geometricrevelation of his own (John Michell). The variety of methods is matched by thevariety of Atlantises thus received.Besides these three principal strains, there are undoubtedly RussianAtlantologists, and certainly some scientific interest there and in EasternEurope, but apart from Nicolas Zhirov and Zden k Kukal (who have beentranslated), these await researchers who know the relevant languages. In anycase, to classify modern Atlantology by national schools overlooks the biggestcontributor of all. None of the twentieth-century authorities, whatever theiralleged sources, could avoid the influence of theosophy.Modern theosophy has passed through two distinct eras, often mistaken for asingle one. The earlier one is represented by the writings of H. P. Blavatskyand her contemporaries; the later, by Charles Webster Leadbeater and AnnieBesant. Blavatsky made some remarks on Atlantis and prehistoric cultures in IsisUnveiled (1877), but it was a series of letters signed by the Mahatmas KootHoomi and Morya that outlined the definitive scheme of human evolution from theoccultist point of view. Blavatsky amplified it in The Secret Doctrine (1888),which chronicles five “root races” that have nothing to do with the coloredraces of French Atlantology but are large-scale stages of human evolution. Theybegin with humanity in an ethereal or gaseous state (the first two root races)and devolve through a gradual coagulation and division into sexes (the third,called Lemurian) into full physicality with the fourth root race (Atlantean).With the fifth (Aryan, our current state), we are on the long return journey tospiritualization.[../Images/img0001.jpg]Figure 6.3. Map showing Atlantis and LemuriaIn Blavatsky’s scenario, every root race except the first suffered one or morecataclysms. Continents disappeared, new lands appeared, mountain chains rose.“The face of the Globe was completely changed each time; the survival of thefittest nations and races was secured through timely help; and the unfitones—the failures—were disposed of by being swept off the Earth. Such sortingand shifting does not happen between sunset and sunrise, as one may think, butrequires several thousands of years before the new house is set in order”⁶[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3247_0] (italics in original). The immediate cause ofthese cataclysms was not an outside agency, such as a comet, but changes in theinclination of Earth’s axis (another topic treated at length in Arktos).As to the dating of these events, Blavatsky was aware that the most advancedscientists of her day allowed an age of Earth of 500 million years. Humanity isvirtually coeval with the planet: the first root races appeared in theprimordial and primary periods, the Lemurians in the secondary period (age ofreptiles), and the Atlanteans in the tertiary period (age of mammals). There isno fossil evidence because early human bodies were not fully materialized. Mostof Atlantis was destroyed 850,000 years ago, leaving a fragment that finallyvanished as recorded by Plato. As for him, he was an initiate who was forbiddento tell the whole truth about the human past. “Aiming more to instruct as amoralist than as a geographer and ethnologist or historian, the Greekphilosopher merged the history of Atlantis, which covered several million years,into one event which he located on one comparatively small island.”⁷[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3249_0]After Blavatsky’s death in 1891, the theosophists kept the basic structure ofroot races while seeking to improve on the details. They tended to move theAtlanteans closer to the present day so that they could be made responsible forStonehenge and the pyramids. One such was Alfred Percy Sinnett, to whom theMahatmas Koot Hoomi and Morya addressed their letters. After the correspondenceceased, he started his own private circle in which an entranced medium gave outfurther information. Sinnett’s friend Leadbeater, in contrast, used his ownclairvoyance to penetrate the distant past, the astral plane, past lives, and soon. The most popular book of occult prehistory, Walter Scott-Elliot’s Atlantisand the Lost Lemuria, derives its Egyptian material from Sinnett’s medium (whomScott-Elliot married) and the rest from Leadbeater.Scott-Elliot’s book includes four maps of Atlantis, first published in 1896,which have been reproduced countless times since. Sinnett, in his preface, saysthat these maps come from “records physically preserved,” and Scott-Elliotdescribes them as “a globe, a good bas-relief in terra-cotta, and awell-preserved map on parchment.” From later sources, we learn that they are inTibet, in the Museum of Records of the Great White Brotherhood, and thatLeadbeater was given permission to visit it in his astral body and copy the mapsthere.The Atlantis myth carries a powerful psychic charge and has served many groupsand individuals in its manipulation of people’s belief systems. I am not in thebusiness of debunking, but I like to get to the bottom of tall tales likeScott-Elliot’s maps. Other popular clichés would be James Churchward’s mu; thelast words of Jesus, reputedly spoken in “pure Mayan”; Katharine Maltwood’sGlastonbury zodiac; the Lemurians of Mount Shasta; and the various Atlanteanscenarios put out by Rosicrucian orders. By clearing away such growths, one hasa better chance of tackling the genuine enigmas of human origins and evolution.Whom, then, should we trust? I listen to them all: Rudolf Steiner; Alice Bailey;the ill-matched traditionalist couple of René Guénon and Julius Evola; theAvalonians from Dion Fortune to John Michell; the excruciating Oahspe; wilyGurdjieff’s Beelzebub; Phylos the Tibetan, who starts the Mount Shasta business;Edgar Cayce; the “I AM” folk (see “The I AM Discources” by Guy Ballard); WilliamDudley Pelley of Silver Shirts fame; Maurice Doreal (Claude Doggins) with hisEmerald Tablets; the teasing trio of George Adamski, Richard Shaver, and GeorgeHunt Williamson; wise old Seth; tough old Ramtha (J. Z. Knight); James Merrillwith his Ouija board—and quite a few others.Am I laughing at them, or with them? It depends on the degree to which they weredeliberately putting one over on their disciples or audiences. And having saidthat, who is meant by “they”? The channelers themselves, or whatever iscommunicating through them? Most channelers seem sincere: almost all of themstarted their careers unwillingly after a transcendent irruption into theirlives. But I am suspicious of their sources, which, when they are not totalbores, often seem to be stretching our credulity for their own amusement. Sincethey do not agree with one another, they cannot all be right: for example, theydate the Great Pyramid at anything from 200,000 to 6,000 years ago. Yet eachsource has an amazing consistency and personality and a seemingly inexhaustiblefund of knowledge.In former times, possession by a god, demon, or spirit was the only explanationfor this phenomenon. Once those were eliminated, it seemed that everything hadto come from the channel’s subconscious mind, or conscious fraud. I offer alightly held alternative hypothesis. It combines Buddhist doctrine with theallegory of cyberspace and goes as follows: When sentient beings die, theyrelease mental energies that may form congelations of intelligence, perhapscombining with other free-floating energies in resonance with them (note that inBuddhism no immortal soul exists to keep them together). These act like filescontaining a mishmash of information, memory, dogma, and speculation, ordered asin life by a logical program akin to language. Given a suitable recipient, theydownload into it, blending with the recipient’s own information, beliefs, and soforth. The way it emerges—through trance, automatic writing, and so on—is merelya matter of style. This suggestion somewhat resembles the idea of the“egregore,” a wandering influence that takes on a pseudopersonality and may benourished by attention, belief, and sacrifice. But it does not hold out muchhope for finding the truth about Atlantis.If we are sincere in our desire for this, we have to face the mystery of timeand its connection with human consciousness. To be brief, it is a question ofwhether sequential time exists at all outside our minds. The metaphysicaldoctrines of East and West suggest rather that time, like space, is part of theillusion inherent in human consciousness. We feel caught in its coils andrhythms, but from a higher point of view, past and future coexist. Somechanneled communications do help us understand this and so does (I’m told)quantum physics. There is the further possibility that the Atlantis visitedthrough clairvoyance, astral travel, or entheogens might be not in Earth’s pastbut in a parallel and present universe.Coming down to Earth, there is an idea that time proceeds not in a straight linebut in cycles. There are two main schemes: the four ages or yugas and theastrological ages based on the precession of the equinoxes. The weightiestchapters of Atlantis and the Cycles of Time survey the origins and permutationsof these theories. My object is to give the reader solid information, properlysourced, so that it is clear where the various claims come from and whatassumptions (cosmological, historical, metaphysical) underlie them. Forinstance, Hindu orthodoxy puts us in the Kali Yuga, which began in 3102 BCE andlasts 432,000 years, getting worse all the time. Others reject these figures,especially the French traditionalists who have made time cycles their particularstudy. René Guénon, Alain Daniélou, Gaston Georgel, and Jean Phaure all come upwith a reduced duration for the Kali Yuga of something over 6,000 years. Theircalculations of its end date and the consequent return of the golden age vary:CE 1999, 2000, 2012, 2030, 2160, and 2442 are all mentioned.There are also contrarian theories. Fabre d’Olivet reversed the yugas, convincedthat the Kali Yuga was not the worst period but the best. Some Buddhists, Jains,and the modern guru Sri Yukteswar have them going alternately up and down, likea sine wave. Each of these conflicting theories needs to be examined for itsroots and motives, rather than accepted on anyone’s authority.There is similar disagreement about the end of the age of Pisces and the dawningof the Aquarian age. The earliest date I have found is 1760, one of four datessuggested in Godfrey Higgins’s Anacalypsis. The year 1881 was once a popularchoice, seeming to agree with another cycle: that of the reigns of the sevenarchangels, which was part of the teachings of the Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor.Carl Jung took the trouble to consult astronomy and pointed out that dating theage of Aquarius depends on which star marks the beginning of the constellation.That gives a wide range, from 1997 to 2154, but the actual year does not mattermuch: it was the whole period of transition that interested him.Calculating the Aquarian age also depends on whether you take the traditionalprecessional number, 25,920 years, giving 2,160 years for each age, or whether,like Jung, you follow the current scientific estimate of about 25,770.Furthermore, you may divide it into twelve ages according to the astrologicalconstellations, which are exactly 30 degrees each, or the astronomical ones,which are of unequal length and whose borders may shift along with the propermotion of their component stars.To put the final wrench in the precessional machinery, many traditional textsassert that Earth’s axis used to be perpendicular to the ecliptic, so that informer times there was no precession and no seasons. Some connect this with thegolden age and with human habitation in polar or arctic lands. If precession isa recent phenomenon, large-scale cyclical theories based on its invariance arenull and void.All of this may seem mean-spirited, for it undermines many cherishedassumptions, but that is not the case. There is a positive joy in this kind ofresearch. The material is philosophically challenging, the parade of charactersfascinating. Some of them may be rogues, paranoiacs, deluded and deluding, butwhat else do we find in profane history? This study, like no other, stretchesthe imagination over all of space, from Mediterranean islands through crustalshifts and crashing moons, right up to the center of the galaxy. It ranges overall of time, from the dawn of the historical period back to the birthday of thispresent Earth. And as we reimagine the past, so we help to form our future.[../Images/img0045.jpg]Figure 6.4.

Something would be out of balance. Yet, welive in a culture where most people will have spent more time in their livescontemplating which style of sunglasses to purchase than they will have spentcontemplating the most important thing in those lives, the sun itself. Somethingis out of balance.It was once absolutely common to give the sun a great deal of thought, respect,and appreciation. Many of the greatest monuments that survive from ancientcivilizations were built to honor the sun. Yet we are raised with the built-inassumption that ancient people were primitive and uncivilized savages. As modernresearchers such as Graham Hancock and Michael Cremo have clearly shown, nothingcould be further from the truth. Though in many ways we now enjoy an advancedtechnology to that which existed thousands of years ago, it is not so certainthat our understanding of the cosmos and our spiritual development have advancedat the same pace.Many modern researchers have explored what remains of the civilization ofancient Egypt, recognizing the cosmological alignment of ancient pyramids andcalculating where their shafts would have originally pointed toward in the nightsky. Others have studied the Mayan calendar and been amazed at the understandingit displays of solar and stellar activities taking place tens of thousands ofyears earlier. Tens of thousands make the pilgrimage to Stonehenge every summersolstice to touch and absorb the energy of the hallowed stones of this Celticmonument. We acknowledge our social and scientific debt to the ancient Greeks,whose rediscovered knowledge helped fuel the Renaissance and lift Europe out ofthe Dark Ages.Yet as we explore the history of these cultures, we all too easily overlook theone underlying principle common to the Egyptians, Maya, Celts, and Greeks, notto mention the Sumerians, Chaldeans, Assyrians, gnostics, Khmer, Norse, Inca,Aztecs, natives of South and North America, and countless other culturesthroughout the world, including today’s Hindu and Shinto religions. This is therecognition that our local star is a conscious entity—a celestial being. Itremains one of the most powerful and unspoken taboos of the Western world andone that even modern researchers of the above cultures are often reluctant tobreach.Many of us have finally let go of the biblical mind-set that placed humans onplanet Earth as the be-all and end-all and raison d’etre of God and theuniverse. Since 1975, we have been seeking other intelligences across thegalaxy, looking for telltale radio signals, incorporating technology thatenlists the brainpower of idle computers throughout the world. Though I quietlycame to the realization that there was intelligence in residence at our localstar in 1966, I only really “came out” on the subject when talk about the searchfor extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) came up. I would then feel compelled topoint out that this search was being conducted in complete ignorance of the mostintelligent character in the neighborhood—our local star. And no special toolsor techniques are required to spot this one—just an open mind that has let go ofan old taboo. It should really be called SSLU—the search for something like us.Our culture is infused with the notion that the sun worship once practicedthroughout the world was born out of ignorance. When SETI got me going on thesubject, I would often get “Are you kidding?” and “Who is this crazy man?”looks—just the sort of looks that my brother and I received in the 1960s whenintroducing people in Britain to the radical freaky notion that what we ateaffected our health and wellbeing. This unfounded assumption came up recently ona Sunday morning spiritual radio program when I was asked, “But they wereprimitive then. Don’t we know better now?” That is an interesting question, andI must reply with a question: Is there anything we know today, from the latestin solar science and astronomy, to physics and quantum mechanics, that has anybearing on the issue of solar consciousness?We will return to that question later, but we first must ask what we know aboutour own consciousness that would assist us in the evaluation of whether such aphenomenon could exist elsewhere, whether in bacteria or thousand-year-oldtrees, in volcanoes or stars.What is this stuff that we are forever talking about raising or lowering? Whatis this quality that distinguishes our complex body with being alive and vital?What do we know about this?We know that many scientists actually doubt its existence. Since they have notools with which to weigh it or measure it, and there seems to be no formulathat can express consciousness, this group finds no alternative but to deny itsexistence. They believe consciousness to be an illusion that is constructed byour brain to gain some, as yet undetermined, evolutionary advantage. Some inthis “grand illusion” camp have a corollary to their belief, which is that humanbeings have no free will and that every single thing we do or think (everyrhyme, each wink and stink) is somehow predetermined by the arrangement ofparticles immediately after the big bang.For scientists who do acknowledge the existence of consciousness, it wasassumed, until very recently, that human beings were the only vessel that itcould possibly inhabit. Nothing else was deemed to be aware of its ownexistence, or functioning on anything other than the level of a biologicalmachine driven by nothing more than the need to propagate the species. Descarteshad a lot to do with this, but now a debate is going on, as some scientistsdevise tests for consciousness, such as recognizing yourself in a mirror orplaying for no apparent reason other than to have fun. This camp is arguing thatorangutans and dolphins and a handful of other species, mainly primates, mightjust share this rare facility.But scientists are not getting very far, perhaps not trying very hard, inunderstanding what consciousness is or from whence it arises. And that isn’tsurprising, considering what a tricky word it is to define—right up there withGod and infinity. There is no accepted standard definition for consciousness.Mystics and philosophers have devoted entire books to it or summed it up withthe two words: consciousness is.Without the need for proof or measurement, we know of our own consciousnessbecause we feel its existence. It was enough for ancient civilizations to knowof solar consciousness because they felt its existence. I do not suggest thatbecause we feel something it is true. But when a near universal belief issustained for thousands of years, it merits consideration. It does not matterwhich continent we look at, or which century, or which culture. Ourpre-Christian ancestors believed that their basic intuition was correct,notwithstanding any explanations and baggage that might thereafter have beenadded to the picture by organizing priests.We might well experience this connection to solar consciousness intuitivelywhen, as children, we put smiling faces on drawings of the sun. But by the timewe leave school, there is little hint of it left, as we adopt the “we knowbetter now” attitude. Which brings us back to that question of just what it isthat we now know better. And who were the original “we” that we know betterthan? Is it science that has taught us that sun worship was primitive andirrational?If we could have told a Mayan or Egyptian sun worshipper about the fusionreaction in the core of the sun, described the very different functions of thenext six layers, and explained the corona and the solar wind that spins from it,his or her jaw would have dropped in delighted awe. Our science would give thatworshipper greater cause to revere the character bringing light and the power oflife to our Earth. The knowledge of anatomy does not diminish our living status.Was it the church that told us sun worship was primitive and irrational? Yes.They knew better because the Old Testament told them so. They had it on God’sauthority, written in his own book, that the sun was just a convenient ball oflight placed in the heavens for the benefit of humankind. And since most of thereligions that had been replaced by the new church were big on sun worship, itwas very much not OK to persist with such ideas. Neither philosophers,scientists nor variants of Christianity were excluded from papal control of suchthinking.The Christianity of the Cathars, influenced by Mary Magdalene’s transmission ofChrist’s teachings, incorporated sun gazing and elements of solar appreciationinto its practice. This, and other unauthorized deviations from Catholic creed,prompted the Vatican to organize twenty years of the brutal Albigensian Crusade(1209–1229) and to create the dreaded Inquisition, dedicated to eliminatingevery last trace of the Cathars religion and its followers.Nearly four centuries later, in 1593, they were again alarmed, this time by theteachings of one Giordano Bruno. Copernicus who came before, and Galileo whocame later, recognized that the sun and planets did not revolve around Earth,believing instead that the whole universe revolved around the sun. Unlike them,Bruno also recognized that our sun was but one of countless stars populating aninfinite universe. He also recognized that the sun and stars were all livingbeings—still something of a blind spot for modern astronomers. He was lured backto Italy, arrested by the Inquisition, and imprisoned for seven years, duringwhich time he refused to recant, even under torture. When finally sentenced todeath, he responded to the judges: “Perhaps you, my judges, pronounce thissentence upon me with greater fear than I who receive it.” His tongue was tiedbefore he was tied to the stake, lest he try to spread his inflammatory ideas tothe assembled crowd.The scientific aversion to considering the question of solar consciousnessstems, in essence, not from solar experimentation, technical investigation, orapplication of the scientific method. It stems from little more than habit, anda religious habit at that.Obviously, we are not going to be able to apply our normal consciousness teststo the sun, with mirrors, questionnaires, and analysis of playfulness. But wecan take a look at what solar scientists have been able to find usingtelescopes, helioseismology, spectral analysis, and some pretty brilliantthinking and deduction. I am not in the business of knocking scientists or theirdiscoveries, but I am intolerant of the unfounded taboos that most of themembrace and to which all of them must conform, or face ridicule.Let us take a very cursory look at a few features of the sun’s seven distinctlevels, to see if these are the sorts of features you would expect to find in aninanimate, unintelligent, accidental agglomeration of simple matter. And thesun’s matter, in common with over 99 percent of matter in the universe, is notin the simple states of solid, liquid, or gas with which we are familiar on thisplanet. Most matter does not have an even balance of electrons and protons andis thus highly fluid and conductive to the transmission of electromagneticenergy. Plasma is very active. Those plasma gas balls that are sold for visualhome entertainment almost look like living things.The hot inner core is where the nuclear fusion reaction takes place, convertingfive million tons of the sun’s mass into energy each second. This reaction hasbeen going on steadily for some 4.5 billion years and is estimated to have atleast as long a future. With the equivalent of billions of hydrogen bombs goingoff every second, some containment around this first layer of the sun isobviously necessary. This second level takes the form of the radiation zone, aregion of very dense matter that is twenty-five times as thick as Earth’sdiameter. Traveling at the speed of light, a photon would pass through thislayer of the sun in about one second, but they have to bounce around a bit onthe journey outward, and it takes them more like a million years to make thetransit. Photons enter this zone as deadly gamma rays vibrating at highfrequency and low wavelength and exit it as safe visible light—the stuff thatreaches our planet and sustains all life.[../Images/img0055.jpg]Figure 7.1. The sun’s coreOutside the radiation zone is the third, and relatively thin, interface layer,described as being like giant twisting ropes of electromagnetic energy. It isthought to be here that electromagnetic energy is produced to power the sun’sinvisible outermost seventh layer, the corona—about which more later. Thisenergy is believed to be generated by the differential rotation of theconvection zone, which surrounds the radiation zone and turns at a differentspeed, producing a dynamo-like effect.Huge bubbles of charged matter carry the photons from the core through theconvection zone to the photosphere with a fractal turbulence compared to that ofwater in a fast boiling kettle. While the density of the plasma at the beginningof the radiation zone is that of gold, by the time we reach the convection zone,the density is that of water. It will emerge into the next level in about aweek, where the density of the sun is now far thinner than Earth’s outeratmosphere.At just 100 to 300 kilometers deep, the visible outer surface of the sun isrelatively as thin as an onion skin. The photosphere provides the setting orbase for many of the sun’s most visible, intriguing, and dramatic features, fromsunspots to solar flares, coronal mass ejections to coronal prominences. IsaacNewton was the first to spot sunspots and track their activity. Records havebeen kept ever since of their cyclical, though inconsistent, nature. Solarscientists are still as puzzled as Newton was by their meaning and mechanism,but have noticed enough of a correspondence with coronal activity to believethat they are managed or controlled by the corona. The same is thought to be thecase with flares, coronal mass ejections, and prominences, each of themfascinating and powerful events that defy any straightforward explanation.We have burst forth from the light-producing core and bumbled through thelight-processing radiation zone, twisted through the electrical interface layer,bubbled through the seething convection zone, and shot out of the photosphere,adding another spark to the universe. We have not reached the outer levels ofthe sun, but already it seems curious to believe that such structured, complex,coordinated, and sustained activity is all going on by accident with nary a dropof intelligence involved. Were solar scientists to step outside the bounds oftheir religiously rooted taboo, I strongly suspect that they would recognizethis complex and energy-rich assembly of active plasma to be another life-formand quite probably one higher than us.I have rushed through describing the processes taking place in the five innerlayers of the sun to give more space in this article to explaining the energeticouter level. The temperature of the sun progressively drops as photons travelfrom a 15-million-degree core to the 5,800-degree photosphere. We would expectthe temperature to drop even further as we travel outward from the surface intothe coldness of space. But instead, the temperature rises—one of manyunexplained aspects of solar behavior. The “atmosphere” of the sun is so thin inmatter content that it would be considered a near vacuum by our standards, butit is rich in energy and activity.The lower level of the sun’s atmosphere, the chromosphere, is populated by whatlook like long thin needles or jets of red light shooting upward at high speed.First spotted in 1851, they are called spicules, and there have been varioustheories as to what they are. The big bubbles of the convection zone may besending sound waves into the chromosphere, powering their upward trajectory atsupersonic speeds. One must wonder about the purpose of this activity in thesystem of a living sun. At the top of the irregular chromosphere, thetemperature has jumped from 5,800 to 20,000 degrees, and at the other end of thewafer-thin transition to the outer atmosphere, the heat runs to a milliondegrees.Now we reach the least understood feature of the sun, and perhaps, its crowningglory. The energy-rich and matter-light corona is bigger than the sun’s physical“body,” stretching two or three million kilometers into space. Temperatures havebecome hundreds of times hotter, ranging from 1 to 5 million degrees Kelvin. Whyhasn’t the heat emanating from sun’s surface just dissipated into the coldsurrounding space? Scientists still struggle to understand why this is.The corona is an invisible electromagnetic phenomenon, but the power of itsactivity and associated events are awesome. It only manifests during a totalsolar eclipse, as even 1 percent of sun’s light will completely overwhelm thatof its corona. What we see at this moment is its eponymous crownlike shapeoutlined by light released by free electrons streaming off the sun, excited bythe corona’s powerful magnetic field lines. Its shape is not constant, changingalong with the sunspot cycle on the photosphere. Although solar scientists holdit responsible for many of the sun’s features, they describe the corona as themost mysterious feature of the sun. Interesting.While scientists grapple with the very real difficulties of explaining thenature and existence of the sun’s corona, permit me to hypothesize about thepossible relevance of this fascinating phenomenon. Perhaps the invisible coronais the most important feature of the sun—that to which all else is geared andthat which is responsible for some of its most far-reaching effects. It isdifficult to resist the temptation to compare aspects of a living conscious sunto our own existence, relating its fusion-reactor core to our own heart or itschromosphere full of spicules to our seeing apparatus. But it is, of course, acompletely different nature of being, and in some respects, one might as well belooking for the nose of a cauliflower or the nipples of a trout.It does seem reasonable, though, to look for the mind of a conscious sun, andhere, I suggest, one need look no further than its corona (see plate 4[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1559_0]). Like our own mind, the corona is essentiallyan invisible extension of the sun. As with the force lines of a magnet, all wecan ever see is the effect of the corona on particles that are in its presence.Some scientists will no doubt continue to debate the existence of a human minduntil tools are developed sensitive enough to register and measure it. In theperfect darkness of a total solar eclipse, does it not seem likely that we arewitnessing the image of a mind infinitely more powerful than our own—without theneed for any special tools?We will leave the sun now, hitching a ride out on the solar wind, a rarefiedstream of charged particles that spins from the corona at speeds of 300 to 900kilometers per second. As the sun turns, the solar wind twists into a hugespiraling electromagnetic bubble called the heliosphere, which holds the entiresolar system in its embrace, cushioning its planets from the potentiallydisruptive effects of cosmic rays. Isn’t that thoughtful?Recognition of the sun and other stars as living beings changes the way we lookat everything, not just galaxies and a universe awash with them, but everythingfrom subatomic particles up to light itself. Could there be similarities ondifferent scales between the 100-plus-billion neurons in own brains and the100-plus-billion stars in our galaxy, all of them sending electromagneticsignals in the direction of their neighbors? How do molecules of water become athundercloud hurling bolts of lightning earthward? Can a tree be tickled by theripple of a breeze, an ocean know its currents’ flow, a mountain feel itsmajesty? How could clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms assemble into somethingas complex and finely tuned as a light-producing star?Could energy have been the original raw material of matter? And is it energythat holds it all together? Is it, too, the architect? For us, it is energy thatprovides the spirit of life. Without energy, we do not live or think. Withoutenergy, there is nothing that we call living left. Yet, we are brought up withthe assumption that it is us who brings life to energy, and not the other wayaround.Why do so many of our linguistic expressions for intelligence rely onlight-related words, using phrases and terms as we shed light on the matter,enabling us to see the light, after which we may be illuminated on the subject,in the light of the brilliant new insights gained from the dazzling ideas of thebright author of an article on enlightenment? Isn’t it delightful?Why are there so many questions? Perhaps it is because we are curious. An openand curious mind drove and directed me along the journey of seven years that wasthe writing of Sun of gOd. The solar path led in many directions, illuminatingan unexpectedly coherent whole as the book progressed. Within its pages, thedogma has been stripped from science and the faith removed from religion toreveal the compatibility of ancient beliefs with cutting-edge science.Relieved of its unfounded antispirit prejudice, science can help us to recognizea universe that is designed from the bottom up, not the top down. This universeis intelligent and well designed without needing an intelligent designer pullingall the strings behind the scenes. Sun of gOd underwrites the ancient wisdom of“all is one” in a refreshing and up-to-date manner, neither rejecting sciencenor relying on revelation to make the point.Today’s marvelous technology enables us to probe the far reaches of the universeand to wonder on the mysteries of matter at a quantum level. Yet, we have stillto rediscover the most elemental aspect of our sun, the most important characterin our lives, even though no technology is required. Like us, it is alive. Andthe knowledge of that improves forever our relationship with the universe."},{"pageContent":"E I G H TWAS OUR SOLAR SYSTEM DESIGNED TO PRODUCE HUMANS?CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT AND ALAN BUTLERIt is strange where research can lead you. More than a decade has passed sincewe joined forces to try and find out if there was any reality to a claim thathighly accurate units of length had been in use during the British Neolithic. Wefound that these supposedly primitive people were using a highly developedscience that connected them to the rhythms of Earth.This led us on to realize that the science used by these Neolithic people didnot die out as we first assumed. In our most recent book, Before the Pyramids,we uncovered rock-solid evidence that the powers that be in Washington, D.C.—inthe White House, the U.S. military, and the highest levels of the Scottish Riteof Freemasonry—are aware of and secretly celebrating this ancient system ofscience.But our biggest personal challenge has been to face up to the consequences ofour own findings; because they have brought us to the point where we have foundcompelling evidence that our planet and its environment have been carefullydesigned for us. Stranger still, there appears to be a message built into thevery fabric of the solar system itself.This was not a finding that we had looked for, or even cared for. We are verypragmatic people working in an area of ancient research that is specialized andvery sober. Here was an idea that was apparently outrageous—but apparentlyinescapable.In early 2009, we had decided to revisit all our findings, which had resulted inthree joint books plus one still in manuscript form (now published). We weretroubled because, despite one of us being an agnostic and the other an atheist,we could not escape the conclusion that we were looking at a message from whatwe called the UCA (unknown creative agency) that had designed our solar systemand all life on Earth.Then in late November 2009, we were contacted by David Cumming, an expert in AI(artificial intelligence), who had studied our evidence in great detail andindependently come to the same conclusion. He claimed that it formed an equationwith a very clear message from the creator.That equation has been refined to:[../Images/img0032.jpg]We describe the mathematics at the end of this article, but the important pointis this:Hlf.π is the specification of the SETI (search for extraterrestrialintelligence) communications frequency for extraterrestrial messages based on agalactic aspect of the hydrogen atom. This shouts, “Pay attention—this is amessage.” Omega (Ω) represents the numerals of the base ten counting system. Theequation states “ten-fingered humans I am talking to you.”The left-hand side of the equation equals the right-hand side, which is thespeed of light in a vacuum measured in Thoms per second (harmonic units ofEarth, moon, sun harmonic). This says, “The message is from the creator”—becausethe speed of light is the most significant physical reality in the universe.Is this credible? The facts behind it certainly are. But we thought we should goback to retrace some of our key findings over the years to help you decide.THE ORIGIN OF THE MEGALITHIC YARDThe starting point of our joint research was simply to consider whetherAlexander Thom had been right or wrong in his identification of a prehistoricunit he called the megalithic yard. He was a professor of engineering at OxfordUniversity who surveyed British and French megalithic sites over the course ofhalf a century until he died in 1985. Thom’s approach was entirely different tothat adopted by any archaeologist. Looking at the scale and obvious planninginvolved in megalithic sites, Thom had been forced to conclude that the plannersand builders must have been highly skilled engineers—just like himself. He,therefore, carefully analyzed what remained of each megalithic site and thentried to imagine what it was the builders had set out to achieve. Once he had apicture in his mind of what he thought their plan had been, he went away tocreate his own solution to the assumed problem. Having drawn up his own design,he then returned to compare the site layout to his own blueprint. He deducedthat the builders had all been working to a common set of units based on hismegalithic yard that was 2.722 feet plus or minus 0.002 feet (829.7 mm plus orminus 0.5 mm).Thom was viewed as an unwelcome outsider by nearly all archaeologists, and eventoday most believe, quite erroneously, that he has been proved largely wrong.Our starting hypothesis was that, if the megalithic yard were real, then it ishighly probable that its apparent accuracy can best be explained by it beingderived from nature rather than an invented unit. If we could identify a naturalorigin, then Thom was probably right; if we couldn’t, the debate will continuebecause it is impossible to prove a negative.It did not take too long for us to realize that there is only one aspect ofnature that delivers up a near-perfect means of creating measures, and that isthe revolving of Earth on its axis—something it does every 86,164 seconds. Thisprovides the potential for creating a unit of time, which can then be used tomake units of length, weight, and capacity—and potentially everything else fromfrequency to temperature.The most obvious way to observe the turning of Earth is to watch the stars,which appear to pass overhead once for each rotation. They also move across thesky in an annual rotation due to Earth’s orbit of the sun. Megalithicastronomers could not help but notice that there were 366 daily star movementsto one annual one.To create a repeatable linear unit from the turning of Earth, the only tools oneneeds is a length of rope, a few poles, a ball of clay, and a piece of string.We knew that ancient peoples from all across time have liked to create patternsin which the same values work upward and downward. And we had good reason tobelieve that early peoples had used a 366day calendar and a 366-degree circle.These astronomers knew that there are 366 star rises (any star such as Sirius)over one circle of the sun, so it was logical to divide the horizon into 366parts to measure the time in 1/366 part of a day.They measured time in the same way that all clocks did until recent times—with apendulum. A handheld ball of clay on a string is a perfect instrument. Whenstationary, it is a plumb line to gauge verticals, and when swinging, its beatsmeasure time with great accuracy. The only factors that have any significanteffect on the beat are the length of the pendulum from fulcrum to the centerlineof the weight and the mass of Earth (gravity). The energy put into the swing bythe user has no effect; if the swing is made more vigorous, it just swingsfaster in a wider arc but the rate of beat remains exactly the same.Our first and most obvious assumption was that the megalithic people had dividedthe horizon up into 366 equal parts and then used a pendulum length that beat366 times.This proved to be spot on. A pendulum that beats 366 times during one 366th ofEarth’s turn was, much to our joy and amazement, half a megalithic yard inlength! A circle scribed by such a pendulum would have a diameter of onemegalithic yard. Archie Roy, emeritus professor of astronomy at GlasgowUniversity (and a friend of the late Alexander Thom), joined us to give a publicdemonstration of how the megalithic yard is a product of measured observationalastronomy.[../Images/img0095.jpg]Figure 8.1. A basic pendulum is a very accurate tool to measure time.[../Images/img0078.jpg]Figure 8.2. A frame 1/366th of the horizon angled to time a starWe later refined the timing method, having realized that the megalithicastronomers had improved their own accuracy by using the movement of the planetVenus at certain times rather than a star. Gordon Freeman, a distinguishedprofessor of chemical physics and a much published amateur archaeologistspecializing in megalithic structures was impressed with this saying: “Tying themy [megalithic yard] to Venus path arcsecond is a major discovery. I’m anadmirer of Thom, but was neutral about the my. Now I’m a convert.”Alexander Thom had been right all along because the chances of this techniqueproducing a perfect fit for his unit could not be a coincidence. But there wasmore—much more to this system. Given that the builders of these megalithic sitessome five thousand years ago used a 366-degree circle caused us to look at Earthitself. Taking the polar circumference as the text-book 40,000,000 meters, weturned it into megalithic units and discovered the following:Earth’s polar circumference = 40,000,000 meters1 megalithic degree (1/366) = 109,290 meters1 megalithic minute of arc (1/60) = 1,822 meters1 megalithic second of arc (1/6) = 303.6 metersNow, 303.6 meters for a second of arc may look a little boring, but it is 366megalithic yards. The actual figure is 829.5 mm, which fits nicely withAlexander Thom’s definition of 829.7 plus or minus 0.5 mm.We now call this beautifully geodetic unit from the 366 system a Thom todifferentiate it from the arguably very slightly less accurate megalithic yard.The megalithic second of arc appears to have been adopted by the Minoan cultureof Create some four thousand years ago. The palaces of Crete were carefullysurveyed by Canadian archaeologist J. W. Graham, who identified a standard unithe called the Minoan foot, which was 30.36 cm. It follows that one thousand ofthese feet make precisely one megalithic second of arc—a decimalized version ofwhat was already an ancient measure.Even earlier, the Egyptian culture had adopted units driven by the samethinking. They took the megalithic yard and made it the circumference of acircle. The diameter of that circle was called a royal cubit, and the hypotenuseof a square from that diameter was called a remen.ARTIFACT-BASED EVIDENCEWhen we wrote Civilization One, we stated that the people who created themegalithic yard must have built very large circles and divided the circumferenceinto 366 parts to be sure that they were viewing 1/366 part of the night sky. Wesuggested that they may well have understood a quick method to do this by makinga circle with a diameter of 233 units (any length would do if they didn’talready have a megalithic yard). They then knew that they would have a circle of732 units, which is twice 366; so they could take every other pole on thecircumference. This is a 99.999 percent accurate means of using pi in apractical manner. For all engineering purposes, this means perfect.Several years later, we found that structures even older than the megalithicstructures demonstrated the use of the 233/732 circles—exactly as we hadpredicted. These are henges—large circular mounds such as the group nearThornborough in North Yorkshire, England. They were built around 3500 BCE, wellbefore the megalithic builders began their stonework phase. What is more theywere using the megalithic yard, or the Thom, as we now call the geodeticallyrefined value of the same length. At Thornborough, there are three interlinkedhenges that are 233 Thoms across and 732 Thoms around their outer perimeter.These structures with units and ratios are about 366 megalithic rods between thecenters of the first two and 360 between the second. The trio, which are alsoexactly three megalithic seconds of arc apart by latitude, have also beenidentified as being laid out as a copy of the stars of Orion’s Belt—exactly likethe Giza pyramids (see plate 5 [../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1563_0]). Thedifference is that these are a thousand years older. We also explain in Beforethe Pyramids how Khufu’s pyramid builders came to this location in England toget instructions on how to plan this star pattern on the ground!WEIGHTS AND MEASURESHaving established that the people of the British Neolithic had units of lengthsand time, we wondered if they had other units, such as capacity and weight. Weknew (or so we thought) that the metric system was devised by the French in thelate eighteenth century when they used a pendulum that beat at the rate of onesecond to create a unit they called the meterre (meaning to beat out time). Theylater made a very small adjustment so that their meter was 1/10,000,000 of thedistance from the equator to the North Pole. To create a unit of capacity theytook a 1/10 part of the meter (10 cm) and made a cube. Filled with distilledwater, this cube’s capacity was called a liter, and its weight was designated akilogram.We applied the same logic to the megalithic yard (which Alexander Thom said wasdivided into forty megalithic inches). So we calculated what afour-megalithic-inch cube would contain. The answer is one pint—to an accuracyof one part in five thousand as defined by the British government in 1601. Andwhen carefully filled with any unpolished grain, such as barley, it weighed justone imperial pound.This was odd in the extreme, but it appears that (unknown to history) Imperialunits were indeed based on cubes because doubling the sides of the cube to eightmegalithic inches is equivalent to one imperial gallon and doubling againproduced a unit equivalent to a bushel, which was used as a dry weight untilrecent times.Next, we found some truly bizarre connections. We thought for thoroughness thatwe ought to consider the volumes of spheres with megalithic dimensions inaddition to the cubes, and a 6-megalithic-inch sphere held a liter and a1.5-megalithic-yard-wide sphere of water weighs a metric ton. The level ofaccuracy was not spot on, but at a level of 99 percent fit, we were surprised,to put it mildly.We are used to modern measurements that are ad hoc, but the 366 system works indepth. Take just two examples:1. Earth mass• 1 megalithic degree (1/366) slice of Earth = 360 × 10²⁰ pounds• 1 megalithic minute slice of Earth = 6 × 10²⁰ pounds• 1 megalithic second slice of Earth = 10²⁰ pounds2. Temperature (hypothetical scale)• Water freezes at 0 degrees• Water boils at 366 degrees• Absolute zero at –1,000 degreesTHE SUMERIAN METERIt is well known that the Sumerian culture had a 360-degree circle and a 360-dayyear. They knew perfectly well that this was wrong and that there are 366 starturns in a complete year, but it made their system of numerical notation andthey built in compensation. They also invented the hour, the minute, and thesecond—or at least they are the earliest people to be known to have used it. (Infact we now know that the second of time was in use in the British Isles atleast 2,500 years before the Sumerians adopted it.)The Mesopotamian cultures, at various times, used a range of linearmeasurements, depending on the item being measured, but there is a generalconsensus that a linear unit known as the kush or barley cubit was the main unitof length for during Sumerian times.The kush was made up of 180 se, meaning barley seed, and was equivalent to 49.94cm and the often-used double kush, which Professor Livio Stecchini stated thathe believed should be 99.88 cm. It follows that this double kush was made up of360 se, just as their year had 360 days and their circle 360 degrees. It is nocoincidence that the double kush is almost identical to the modern meter becausethey were both based on a pendulum that swings at the rate of once a second.The Sumerians and later cultures of the region around the Tigris and Euphratesrivers used a sexadecimal counting system of base tens and sixties. Theirdivisions of time were very neat, indeed:Year = 360 daysMonth = 360 hoursDay = 360 gesh (a gesh was 4 minutes or 240 seconds)Each of the Sumerian hours represented 1 degree of the moon’s journey aroundEarth and every degree of the moon’s journey was split again, by 60 to giveminutes of the arc and by 60 again to give seconds of the arc.Today, we use seconds to measure many things, including the speed of light,which is 299,792,458 meters per second. If we change that to kush per second, weget the amazingly round figure of 600,000,000—which is a beautiful sexadecimalvalue (99.95 percent accuracy).THE JEFFERSON PARADOXThomas Jefferson, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, was anamazing polymath. He set out to create a new system of units for his fledglingcountry, which—apart from the dollar—were never adopted. He started by lookingat what means nature provided for producing a repeatable unit, and like us, hequickly identified the spinning of Earth. Furthermore, he used a pendulum thatbeat at the rate of once per second as his starting point, completely unaware ofits ancient origins. He recorded the following statement:A pendulum, vibrating freely, in small and equal arcs, may be so adjusted in itslength, as, by its vibrations, to make this division of the earth’s motion into86,400 equal parts, called seconds of mean time. Such a pendulum, then, becomesitself a measure of determinate length, to which all others may be referred toas a standard.¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3253_0]Jefferson also carefully looked at the units of measure from Europe, and he wassurprised to find that they were not in the least haphazard as generallythought. He wrote:This seems to have been so combined as to render it indifferent whether a thingwere dealt out by weight or measure; for the dry gallon of wheat, and the liquidone of wine, were of the same weight; and the avoirdupois pound of wheat, andthe troy pound of wine, were of the same measure.Another remarkable correspondence is that between weights and measures. For 1000ounces avoirdupois of pure water fill a cubic foot, with mathematicalexactness.² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3255_0]He was bemused by the obvious science that lay hidden behind old measure:What circumstances of the times, or purposes of barter or commerce, called forthis combination of weights and measures, with the subjects to be exchanged orpurchased, are not now to be ascertained. But a triple set of exactproportionals representing weights, measures, and the things to be weighed andmeasured, and a relation so integral between weights and solid measures, musthave been the result of design and scientific calculation, and not a merecoincidence of hazard.³ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3257_0]Jefferson concluded that some very ancient but long-forgotten science was behindthese unexpected correspondences. He concluded: “but the harmony here developedin the system of weights and measures . . . from very high antiquity.”When Thomas Jefferson had finished creating his own new system of measures, hisuse of the pendulum and the second of time had connected him directly back intothe system from prehistory. Though he could not know it, the following is true:1,000 Jefferson feet = 360 megalithic yards366 Jefferson furlongs = 1 megalithic degree of arc of Earth366² Jefferson furlongs = exact circumference of EarthThis is a case-winning piece of evidence.Megalithic yard deniers or those who wish to casually dismiss the 366 system asall being a strange set of coincidences have to explain away the Jeffersonparadox. Why is the ancient measure (still described in textbooks as ad hoc)connected in the way Jefferson described and how could his “new” systemharmonize perfectly with a system employed five thousand years earlier some6,000 kilometers away to the east?THE SUN AND THE MOONHave you ever wondered how marvelous total eclipses are?It is a very strange quirk of fate indeed that the disc of the moon should seem,from an earthly perspective, to be exactly the same size as the sun. While wecasually take it for granted that the two main bodies seen in Earth’s skies lookthe same size, it is actually something of a miracle. Most people are fullyaware that the moon is tiny compared to the sun, but that it is much, muchcloser to us, which causes the two to appear equal in size. To be precise, themoon is 400 times smaller than the star at the center of our solar system, yetit is also just one 400th of the distance between Earth and the sun.The odds against this optical illusion happening at all are simply huge—but howbizarre that both values are the same, perfectly round number. Experts aredeeply puzzled by the phenomenon. Isaac Asimov, the respected scientist andscience-fiction guru, described this perfect visual alignment as being “[t]hemost unlikely coincidence imaginable.”This perfect fit of the lunar and solar discs is a very human perspectivebecause it only works from the viewpoint of someone standing on Earth’s surface.And it only works at this point in time because it was very different in thepast, and it will change again as the moon moves away from Earth.The magic of the moon’s movements above our heads goes to even more astonishinglevels. By some absolutely incomprehensible quirk of nature, the moon alsomanages to very precisely imitate the movements of the sun. It imitates theperceived annual movements of the sun each month.The full moon is at its highest and brightest at midwinter, mirroring the sun atmidsummer, and at its lowest and weakest at midsummer, when the sun is at itshighest and brightest.The strangeness of the Moon continues when one considers its structure. It iseither hollow or made up of extremely low-density material at its center. It hasits great centers of mass distributed in various places at relatively low pointsjust below its surface. This is odd in the extreme.[../Images/img0014.jpg]Figure 8.4. Midwinter and midsummer sunset and moonset; this drawing shows thepeculiar relationship of the sun and moon throughout the year as seen fromEarth. At midsummer in the Northern Hemisphere the sun sets north of west,whereas the full moon sets south of west. At midwinter the situation isreversed, with the sun setting south of west and moon setting north of west.Its origin is also mysterious. The material that forms the moon came from thesurface of Earth, but there is no satisfactory explanation for how thishappened. The so-called double-whack theory seems unlikely in the extreme.Applying the megalithic 366 system of geometry and Thoms to the moon and the sunproduces an astonishing result:Polar circumference of the moon = 13,162,900 Thoms1 megalithic degree (1/366) = 35,964 Thoms1 megalithic minute (1/60) = 600 Thoms1 megalithic second (1/6) = 100 ThomsThe sun produces:Polar circumference of the sun = 5,271,967,000 Thoms1 megalithic degree (1/366) = 14,404,281 Thoms1 megalithic minute (1/60) = 240,071 Thoms1 megalithic second (1/6) = 40,011 ThomsGiven it is impossible to establish an exact circumference for the sun’ssurface, this result can be considered to be 40,000—as one would expect, giventhat the sun is four hundred times the diameter of the moon.How peculiar that the sun and the moon comply with the same system that definesEarth so well? It is almost as though we are looking at the blueprint of thesolar system.THE RHYTHM OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMThe fact that the 366 system worked so perfectly for Earth, the sun, and themoon caused us to look at every other planet and moon in the solar system.Nothing. None of our neighbors come close to fitting the system. We even triedusing each planet’s own spin-to-orbit value rather than Earth’s 366, but thisalso drew a blank. There seems to be something very special about our planet andour moon’s relationship with the sun.We stated to look closely at every aspect we could and the following values fellout:366The number of complete rotations of Earth in a yearThe number of Thoms in a megalithic second of arc on EarthThe percentage size of Earth compared to the moon100The number of Thoms in a lunar megalithic second of arcThe number of times Earth rotates faster than the moon400The number of times the sun is larger than the moonThe number of kilometers the moon turns on its axis in a dayThe number of times the moon is closer to Earth than the sun[../Images/img0007.jpg]Plate 1.

These integer numbers could not possibly fallout of the Earth-moon-sun relationship by accident when every other solar systembody appears to have no rules whatsoever.SETI, originally set up by NASA, spends a vast amount of energy searching forradio messages from a nonhuman origin, based on the belief that we are probablynot alone. SETI has been criticized by a number of physicists who argue thatradio is not a viable means of communicating across the vast amounts of spaceand time involved in the universe. Some have suggested that a message is morelikely to come by means of large physical objects.Consider these words by Professor Christopher Rose and Dr. Gregory Wright:“Rather than transmitting radio messages, extraterrestrial civilizations wouldfind it far more efficient to send us a ‘message in a bottle,’ some kind ofphysical message inscribed on matter. And it could be waiting for us in our ownbackyard.”Could the moon have been constructed as a message by integrating ratios andvalues of both the sun and the moon? The problem is that all these values onlywork now—at this point in time, which means that the message sender intended forit to be discovered right at this point in time. Did they know that humans wouldhave developed the intelligence to read the message at this point?It all sounds very weird; especially to us because we are hard-nosed pragmatistsand certainly not wishful-thinking believers in exotic ideas. Until now that is,because evidence should not be ignored just because it is not what you expectedto see.Could humans have been “seeded” on a planet that would sustain us? It is a factthat the Moon has been a very accurate “incubator” to nurture life at all of itsstages of development. If Earth did not have our unique Moon there would be nohumans. That is certain.Which brings us to David Cumming’s idea that all of this can be expressed as anequation that formally identifies that there is a message:[../Images/img0032.jpg]The equation describes a relationship between the hydrogen fine transition line,the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle, and the speed oflight in a vacuum.Cumming first realized the importance of the equation when he recognized theequation produced the number 361,449—a very accurate value for the speed oflight expressed in the Thom units of an ancient Stone Age measurement system.First, why is the top line of the equation, Hlf.π, significant? SETI searches ona frequency equal to the frequency of the hydrogen line multiplied by pi(Hlf.π). This frequency was suggested by Pyotr Makovetsky, for various reasons,as the best potential transmission frequency that should be searched for signsof extraterrestrial intelligence, and this frequency was adopted by SETI. Thesearch frequency equals 1420.405751 MHz multiplied by 3.141592653 (pi is chosento 10 significant figures to match Hlf) equals 4462.336272. If you check whatfrequencies members of the SETI alliance are listening on currently, you’ll findthat Makovetsky’s frequency features in many of the lists SETI researchers areusing.Second, why is the value of omega significant? This is the number0.0123456789—all the characters of the base 10 number system. Cumming states themessage originator would know that this is a very likely number system for anylife-form to use. At the same time, using all the consecutive characters of anynumber system at all, in a message, is a very direct sign that this is amessage, an ordered intelligent communication and not, he says, a randomoccurrence.Take pi/omega (π/Ω) and work this out. Our value for pi is 3.141592653 (tensignificant figures are used for pi, as this is what we’re using for omega),divided by the omega value of 0.0123456790 (using more significant figures won’taffect the calculation), this gives us the result of 254.4690072. The result ofthe calculation is actually a value in Thoms, namely 254 milli-Thoms, or moreconveniently expressed as 0.2544690049 Thoms.Standard physics says that the frequency of a wave, multiplied by the wavelengthof that wave, is equal to the speed of the wave. In the case of the equation,when you divide out pi/omega, the answer must be equal to the wavelength of thehydrogen line, because the hydrogen line frequency multiplied by the hydrogenline wavelength must equal the speed of light.When we look at the overall equation, we know in advance that the equation willgive the value for the speed of light very accurately because what we’re doingis multiplying the frequency of the hydrogen line by the wavelength of thehydrogen line. But remember, we’ve divided pi (3.141592653) by omega(0.0123456790) to get a result for the hydrogen line wavelength expressed inThoms, so the fact that we get a highly accurate answer appears to be nothingshort of a miracle.The speed of light calculated using the equation is 1420,405,751 cycles per sec(frequency [Hz]) multiplied by 0.2544690072 Thoms (wavelength). This works outat 361,449,241.3 Thoms per sec. This equals 299,804,073.2 meters per sec. Thisresult for the speed of light is 99.996 percent correct.Applying Occam’s razor, Cumming claims that we are left with the simpleconclusion that Earth, the sun, and the moon must have been created to accordwith the equation of creation.ANCIENT KNOWLEDGEOne question that needs to be asked is: How did the people of the BritishNeolithic come to know all about the 366 system and the magic of the sun, moon,and Earth? Presumably, they were told. The Sumerians, who did leave writtenrecords, say they were told by strange outsiders who taught them the secrets ofastronomy and science.But among the many surprises we have endured over the last few years, it is onewe came across in early 2009 that stumped us. As we explain in Before thePyramids, there can be no doubt that the Founding Fathers of the United Statessecretly designed Washington, D.C., using megalithic seconds of arc for everydetail of the city plan. It is still happening. The Pentagon is a perfect andinspirational exposition of Stone Age knowledge—using the 366 system and theThom with as much perfection as Stonehenge or Thornborough.And this was driven by the 33rd Degree of the Ancient Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry. Presidents and people unknown have been driven to build a cityusing God’s own values—a city fit for God’s great purpose.Do the powers that be in the United States already understand this message? Arethey preparing to respond? We believe that something very special is about tohappen, and the world needs to know what it is."},{"pageContent":"N I N ESCIENCE VERSUS RELIGIONFROM GENESIS TO ATLANTIS AND THE MEASUREMENTS OF THE GODSHARRY SIVERTSEN AND STEPHEN REDMANThis article introduces the two intimately related books of over five hundredpages each by Harry Sivertsen and Stephen Redman, which, under the project nameof Megalith, Masonry, Myth and Measure, are individually titled Deluge: FromGenesis to Atlantis and Measurements of the Gods.In 1971, Keith Thomas of St. John’s College Oxford published a fascinating booktitled Religion and the Decline of Magic. In the course of the work, he gaveexamples of commonalities between the two subjects. Today, we have a differentdebate, not religion versus magic but religion versus science. So how are thesetwo seemingly diverse subjects defined? The word science is ultimately derivedfrom the Latin word for knowledge, scientia. Hence, science can be described asknowledge. Of course, given what is generally known as the scientific method, wecan add the words “gained by experiment or experience” or something similar toknowledge for a clearer description. However, knowledge is the dominatingfactor.Religion, on the other hand, as described in 1535 and contained among numerousother similar descriptions in The Oxford English Dictionary, is seen as:Recognition on the part of human beings of some higher unseen power as havingcontrol of his destiny, and as being entitled to obedience, reverence, andworship.Yet such a description, while perhaps being suitable for the commonly acceptedperceptions of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, does not necessarily fit themultitude of beliefs that have blossomed among the world’s cultures. Further tothis, the primary arguments of today revolve around the concept of creation exnihilo, or out of nothing, versus the scientific approach of physics andevolutionary biology. Yet, while the physics concept of the big bang is as wellknown as Darwin’s and Wallace’s ideas regarding evolution, the source for thecreation side of the argument appears in most arguments to be derived solelyfrom the biblical account. But from where did this concept arise? Is this aHebrew construct or can the source be found elsewhere?Ultimately, the creation concept of the primary religions of today is derivedfrom Indic sources, long predating any Hebrew writings. In fact, much of theearly Bible is drawn from such foundations, but this has passed unrecognized bymost.Religious critics claim that religion is based on belief and not knowledge, butcould not knowledge have led to belief in a similar fashion as scientificendeavor has led to beliefs of a whole variety of types of knowledge in themodern world? People had to ask questions to arrive at the conclusion that Earthwas created; they had to have knowledge to raise those questions. This being thecase, religion, as science, is based on knowledge. Perhaps the knowledge was ofa different variety to that today perceived as valid, or possibly there islittle difference, and that lacking the learning that has evolved during thepast century, human beings arrived at the only logical answer they could find,an answer that in fact was a very much simplified version of today’s ideas.Conceivably, as many of the writings of the religious works stem from earlieroral traditions, from a time before writing was developed, the meanings of someof the works have been misunderstood. Possibly, much is allegory for somethingelse. Just maybe, the strange tales in fact make references that originallywould have been understood in a similar fashion as do the science reports oftoday. All it would take is for science fact to be disguised in a story to makethe memorizing of the important elements easier than it otherwise would be. Whatwould result is what we term allegory, and indeed, this was a common ploy beforethe development of writing.The well-known scientist Richard Dawkins is vociferous in his condemnation ofreligion. Dawkins, along with the British Humanism Association, has beeninvolved in a campaign that uses London buses to carry the slogan “ThereProbably Is No God.” We agree, and in fact would go further; we are convincedthat the principles of the major religions sprang out of what today would betermed scientific enquiry. Dawkins, in his much acclaimed work The Selfish Gene,developed the theory of memes, a concept later taken up and popularized by SusanBlackmore in her book The Meme Machine. A meme is an idea, a tune, a conceptthat takes over one’s thinking, in Dawkins’s words, “parasitizes” the mind. Oneexample Dawkins uses is the concept of life after death.Yet, Dawkins, in his blanket negative treatment of religion, has allowed his ownmind to be taken over by the meme of religious condemnation. He has not appliedthe scientific enquiry of his training to make a value assessment of the worksthat influence the believers. In other words, Dawkins’s adamant refutation makeshim equally as guilty of unfounded belief as he asserts applies to religiousbelievers. Both are directed in their thinking by memes of beliefs, thereligious of their faith, and Dawkins in the nonexistence of any value in thereligious works.Let us steer a middle road and reveal what both Dawkins and the religiousbelievers have missed. We shall show where early thinking in fact was based onwhat today would have been accepted as logical deduction and not merely faith ina religious concept; the religious element that embodied such information camelater. Our source is ancient Indic material from which, as becomes apparent inour book Deluge: From Genesis to Atlantis, eventually all the primary religionstook their guide; indeed, there are even commonalities in Egypt. The informationfrom which the following was developed is derived from this book and reveals thetype of analysis contained between its covers.CREATIONThe questions of today also perplexed the minds of the sages of ancient times,the most prominent query being from where did all derive? In humanity’sexperience, all grew or was made, except Earth and what was in the skies.Animals mate to produce offspring, flowers need pollinating insects toreproduce, but the stars did not reproduce, except for comets, in the form ofmeteorites, which were flung away from the parent body. Strange. The stones ofEarth were just there. Like the sun and the moon. The moon has its phases, whichwere reasonably well understood, and the sun moved north and south during thecourse of a year—knowledge, scientia, gained via simple observation. All exceptcomets and meteorites were regular and steady. One knew what was to happen inthe skies; they were predictable, and one could prophesize what was going tohappen generations into the future. The heavens give accurate counts of time—ofdays, months, and years; of numbers; of math. All was confirmed via repeatedobservations, what today would be termed the scientific method, and wasunderstood more than twelve thousand years ago, at the end of the last ice age,which is approximately when our story commences.But while reproduction and heavenly movements were generally understood inprinciple, it was not known for where or what it was all derived. Given that thestellar movements were as steady as a mark on the rim of a wheel, even if thatwheel was a section of a log, which, when rolled, brought the mark regularlyback to its starting point, the whole of the universe must have been created orfashioned to work so accurately; nothing else observed had such symmetry. Sofrom a sequence of logical deductions, it was determined that, lacking anothersatisfactory explanation, the whole of the universe had to have been created;the sun, moon, and stars would not have merely grown as neither did the groundupon which these thinkers stood, but neither could they have emerged fromnothing.Hence, we have knowledge, scientia, determining that all that is known had tohave had a creator. Fine, but from where did the creator’s raw materials derive,from what did this creator fashion not only Earth but the sun, moon, and stars?Taking this further, if there was a creator, who or what created the creator?This line of investigation was getting into a bit of an eddy, so an inventionwas made, a power greater than the creator, a power that was just that, power, apower that willed a creator into being.Here we have the Indic Brahman, the overarching power, that which is ineverything and is everything—from thought to rock, from bird to fish, timber towater, from flame to ice—is the overarching indescribable, omnipotentever-present abstract entity that is in all and is all. Effectively, the onlyword that adequately describes Brahman is energy. Brahman is simply pure energy,and as modern science has shown, it is from energy that all in the universe isderived. However, Brahman could not make the visible, physical elements;something had to happen to turn this energy into an observable universe. Brahmanrequired a creator, a builder, to turn ideas into reality, a catalyst thatturned energy into action. Brahman willed the creator Brahma into being to turnBrahman’s desires into realities—the creative moment, the source of all; fromraw energy came the explosion of creation, from raw energy came the universe andall within.Invention? Yes, it was. Satisfactory explanation? For the available informationat the time—yes. Complies with modern interpretations? Take away the elementsthat describe characteristics that would apply to human personality and yes.Creation based upon logic, effectively an early description of what we think ofas the big bang, an interpretation that suffered only from a lack of thescientific information available today and that made no allowance for the vasttime lapses involved simply because there was no comprehension of this, butnevertheless, a definition that in fact preempted the modern concept. This was atheory based upon logic that in fact has stood the test of time but has beengrossly misunderstood and ignored. Religious? No.THE FLOODDemonstrating close observation of the skies since the end of the last ice age,we here relate a little of what constituted the flood story.It was noticed that the whole of the cosmos appeared to rotate around a specificpoint in the sky, the northern end of the axis of the universe. The closest tothis point was a particular star that (as we know today) got no closer thancirca 4.7 degrees. This was Vega in the northern celestial hemisphere. Oppositethis star in the southern skies, at the other end of the imaginary axis in thecosmos, was a similar situation; however, the star there, Canopus, was fartherfrom the southern imaginary axis endpoint; here we find a bright light in thesky that circles 7 to 8 degrees from the axis end or due south.The northernmost of these stars, when seen in position at the end of theuniversal axis, became the seat of creation, the home of the creator Brahma, asall revolved around the creator. From this north polar position, Brahmacontrolled the strings of all the stars and planets, keeping them in theirallotted positions. Brahma in that polar position was recognized as the polestar.Then, shortly after 12,200 BCE both the north polar star Vega and itscounterpart in the south, Canopus, started moving away from their allottedpositions. Simultaneously, the sea level rose; the farther away from the ends ofthis axis the stars moved, the higher the waters rose. These stars had beendirection-giving entities for hundreds of years, and now they were moving; theheavens were not quite so stable after all. Something was wrong; the creator hadmoved out of position or the whole universe had moved, as surely the creatorwould stay in position? The stars were no longer linked to the central point, asthe guiding star of the extreme northern skies was no longer in place relativeto the remainder of the universe. The invisible strings that held all togetherwere broken. Not only that, but Earth was no longer the stable place it oncewas, as coastal flooding was now the norm. Something must have gone wrong forBrahma to allow this destruction to happen.This flooding, coupled with the loss of pole stars, continued for many years,and records were kept of the movements of the heavens. As time was denoted bythe movements of the sun, moon, and stars, the years were counted. People wereflooded out of their homelands, and one particular group who had observed themovements of both stars from their vantage point on the equator at Sundaland(south Malaysia) eventually found themselves in northwest India in what is nowPakistan at Merhgarh. Other groups from coastal regions adjacent to Sundalandmoved northward to China and adjacent regions.After many years, another star came to replace the closely circling northernlight, although this did not happen to the south. By 8100 BCE, 3,600 years afterthe loss of Vega, the star Tau Hercules of the constellation Hercules was veryclose to the polar position, in fact within 3 degrees or, in terms of time, 500years, and the skies were steady once more.Brahma, although appearing different and not so bright, was back in place,albeit in a different constellation. By 7600 BCE, Tau Hercules was as close asit would get to the polar position, within about 0.75 of a degree, and shortlyafter this, before 7100 BCE, there was a turndown in the climate, and the seasstopped rising. The floods even reversed, and there was a new pole star. Herewas an apparent correlation: lose a pole star, and there is coastal flooding;gain a pole star, and after a while it stops. Once a different pole star is inplace, all is new; the constellation surrounding the star is different—a newcreation of the heavenly realm, the northerly abode of the god of creation.The climate change was not to last, however, and soon the waters started risingagain, just as Tau Hercules was leaving the polar position. This change furthercorrelated loss of the pole star with flooding. Once more the specter ofdestruction put fear into people’s minds. There was destruction, not only onEarth, but devastation in the heavens. Once more people moved away from therising seas, roughly the region of south Malaysia, as applied to the specificpeople of which we write, between Hong Kong and Borneo. There was little oftheir original homeland left. Other refugees from the rising waters of adjacentareas found themselves eventually moving to regions such as China and Japan;others found a new home in the Middle East, and some as far afield as Europe.Calendars were kept, the years counted, and once more, in 3300 BCE, along cameThuban in the Draco constellation as a pole star, after millennia of chaos inthe heavens and ever increasing flooding. Sundaland was now underwater; theplain between Hong Kong and Borneo, where the people who moved to Merhgarh oncelived, was now under many feet of water. This time, however, the floods stoppedcompletely; the sea level had risen about one hundred meters and was nowreasonably stable, and there was a new pole star, a new creation to confirmcessation of flooding. Cause and effect: lose a pole star, and there are floods;gain one, and the floods stop and all goes back to normal. This was pure logic,scientia gained via observation and thought.Here is the basis of the flood story in the religious works. The familiar talestarted in India but later spread across most of the world to China, the MiddleEast, Greece, and eventually even to Europe. Almost certainly there are elementsof native versions telling the same tale hidden in localized myths that have yetto be deciphered. The counts of thousands of years were diligently recorded witha flood period being a canonical 3,600 years and the creation epoch an era of1,000 years. Manu, the Indian Noah, was a manifestation of Brahma the creatorand created all anew after the flood, whereas the Hebrew authors claimed thatGod’s chosen family, that of Noah, carried the essentials of creation in a boat.Maharaja Druva or Druva-loka is the generic Indian term for pole star and isalso an alternative name for Manu. Manu lasts until he is created anew, then hisson (also Manu) takes over. The constellation Hercules is seen as a depiction ofManu conducting austerities standing on one toe (the pole star Tau Hercules) onthe banks of a river. The river is the Milky Way in its most northerly position,similar to the way the Nile was seen in Egypt. Plato based his Atlantis tale onthis description, with the flooding being that which occurred before the onsetof Tau Hercules, before the Pillars of Hercules. He was referring to a time, notan earthly location.So why the tales of boats? There is little invention without good reason. Raincame from the skies, hence the source was a heavenly ocean, as noted in theGenesis account; after all, no one had observed water going upward. Rain fellfrom the skies; the heavens pivoted around the pole star (the seat of creation),and when this moved, the heavenly ocean was disturbed, a heavenly flood ensued.A heavenly ocean meant the gods or lights in the sky needed boats to get around,and they had to move about to organize a new heavenly creation, a newconstellation with its pole star in place. All is astronomical; even the fortydays and nights of rain is, in fact, a reference to the loss of view of thePleiades, as recorded by classical authors, and the date of the flood sodescribed can be ascertained to the day—twenty days before the vernal equinox in2300 BCE. The new year commenced at the first new moon after the wintersolstice, meaning the count of days given in Genesis for this description iscorrect.This flood has had great influence, as Noah’s “boat”—a strange rock formation onMount Nisir in Turkey, precisely where the Chaldean legend states it is to befound (the region is now known as Durupinar after the Turkish flier whophotographed the formation)—was surveyed in antiquity, as well as recently, andit was emulated within the Pyramid of Khufu, albeit in a scaled-down fashion.The funerary boat of Khufu has its length the same as the width or beam of themythical boat of the gods in Turkey, and this is not a coincidence; it is a veryodd measure.So as it was observed that all revolved around the pole star, the pole of theecliptic was not understood when the flood tale was developed; it was a logicalassumption that if the pivoting point was knocked out of place, then all wouldrun amok. As there was a celestial ocean from which came rain, any travel in theheavenly realms would by necessity be by boat. The sun traveled in a boat pulledby fish in Egyptian lore; boats appear in Indian lore where Varuna is afloat inthe vessel in a similar fashion to Ra, although here there is mention of oars,and it is notable that while Ra’s boat is towed by a fish, so also is that ofManu. There is logic in these stories, a logic not even noted by most of thereaders of the works.A different and seemingly unrelated version of the sun’s traveling vehicle fromIndia is the chariot, here pulled by seven horses, in fact the Pleiades. This isseasonal and datable as the Pleiades reference applies loosely to the springperiod circa 3500 BCE, when the Pleiades rose about thirty-eight minutes beforethe sun and hence were seen to be “pulling” the sun over the horizon. Whilehorses are a little imaginative, here we are moving toward an Earth-in-heavenconcept and not as commonly portrayed the other way around, the heavenly sea andboats along with the pivot of the world are logical deductions, given thelimited amount of information available to the seers of the day. That they areillogical to us today is immaterial; they were derived from logical deductionand limited knowledge.By the time of the New Testament, the whole pole star sequence of seven starswas known, and it is replicated in the Book of Revelations under the guise ofkings, some fallen some standing. Of course by this time, religious fervor hadovertaken reason; although some, such as the author of Revelations, obviouslywere aware of the truth behind the tales. It seems certain that a succession ofwise men, a small minority, perhaps a priesthood, handed down the originalinterpretations to successive generations.Hence, we see that a creator, later to become, via the machinations of humanimagination, God, was originally a necessary part of ancient science, definitelynot religion. These people were logical and developed some sound philosophies;in many ways they were very clever. The Indian sages laid the foundations of thescience of today (see Measurements of the Gods).Logically, while many cultures seemingly worshipped their ancestors, theprinciple religious concepts of the modern world were developed primarily forpolitical reasons, laws from God via Moses and the Ten Commandments being atypical example. Lacking further knowledge, the average person would, of course,accept what the elders stated, and their minds would be taken over by the memeof religious faith. One cannot break God’s laws, which is somewhat different tothose of a tribal leader, but he now has God on his side, and miscreants have toanswer to and be punished by God through him. Different cultures developed avariety of laws, but in essence, it was relatively easy to keep the peacethrough fear of God. The Christian message turned this on its head, and one wasnow supposed to love God, as his laws were good. Yet the “love one another”message of the Sermon on the Mount exists in an early Buddhistinterpretation—not as a religious concept or dogma but as a philosophical way topeace. Most ideas have a predecessor, and with Buddhism, we again are headingback toward India.Numerous hints and clues to the astronomical elements of the flood tale can befound in the religious (science?) books. What was initially merely a suspicionof greater knowledge being hidden in the ancient texts has been confirmed byin-depth research, including the results of archaeological investigation. Infact, the familiar measures of premetrication are many thousands of years old,and there is much information regarding these units and their use among thepages of the Bible.Perhaps historians of science should take a long hard look at what are generallydismissed as valueless religious texts; as seen above, these tell a tale ofquestioning and endeavor, a quest to understand the universe, an investigationthat is still ongoing today.THE BOOKSThe two works here are irrevocably linked. The original concept was for a singlebook, but the volume of information unearthed dictated that two books wererequired. Deluge: From Genesis to Atlantis deals primarily with the subjects ofits title, while Measurements of the Gods explores ancient measures and findsmuch that has escaped conventional learning. This latter work reveals a greatdeal that is very easily checked by the reader and shows how the enquiry can be,as we hope it is, extended by others. Both books commence in modern times andhave as their ultimate destination the same place on Earth, Sundaland. It is tothis specific location that the evidence has led the enquiry.Measurement systems, one would think, would be the province of the historian ofmathematics. Yet, the subject has hardly been touched by those who logicallywould understand the subject area. Perhaps as textually much has been shroudedby myth, one could understand this, but again, the work of John Michell, theresearcher who gave the principal author of this work his first insight into theunits in use in the past, has been in the public domain for nearly thirty yearsand academia has not taken it on board. In Measurements of the Gods, we tracethe uses of the measures through Europe, classical Greece, Egypt, andMesopotamia to India, where the development of the systems took place. There arelinks seen between India and China, which again confirm Michell’s Earthdimensions.In the process of this exploratory journey, much is revealed that seemingly hasnot been published elsewhere, including the use of Michell’s interpretation ofthe anciently accepted Earth circumference in the scales of medieval maps andcharts. The development of the unit measures is far older than most wouldimagine, and the proof is in the archaeology of Merhgarh, now in Pakistan, butthe measuring of Earth, an essential prerequisite for the development of thevalues, took place elsewhere—and even earlier than the dates of 7500 to 8000 BCEthat archaeologists have ascribed to the remains at Merhgarh.Effectively, this work reveals a great deal that convention has missed withabundant evidence to reinforce the arguments involved.DELUGE: FROM GENESIS TO ATLANTISIn this book, the flood evaluation seen above is relayed with, of course, farmore detail than presented here in this article. The work commences with a briefoverview, which leads to an examination of the arguments that ensued with theonset of the discipline of geology and the realization that, in fact, Earth isvery old. From there, the book moves to the Mountains of Ararat and eventually,after revealing (and refuting) the ideas of some others, arrives at the objectof the tale in Genesis, the ark of Noah. This is a geological anomaly at what isnow known as Durupinar in Turkey, at the precise location recorded in the Epicof Gilgamesh.But there was a second ark, the ark of the covenant. This is connected to thetale, as much revolves around information hidden by the use of numbers andmeasures, and here it is revealed that the same cubit value applied to Noah’svessel was in use for this ark. A smaller derived unit applied to the tabernacleand moving from there to Solomon’s Temple, it is seen that this smaller unitapplied to all except the temple surrounds and the mysterious oblation to theLord. The measurement values are explained in the text.This oddity, the oblation to the Lord, this allocation of a large tract of land,is, in fact, quite informative, as numerically, as indicated by its dimensions,it is a representation of the ark of Noah. Here we have an explanation for arkrepresentations, paintings, and carvings being of a boat shape with what cannotbe described as anything else but a stone built temple aboard. The oblation, thegrossly oversized ark depiction contained Jerusalem, itself a representation ofEarth and its attendant temple. There are hints in the descriptions of thistemple that much is of an astronomical nature, and as seen above, this iscorrect.The measures seen here were originally developed from biblical texts—purely asan exercise in possibilities. It emerges that they are correct; they link tonumerous other unit values as discovered by Michell and, in fact, were used bythe designers of religious buildings in medieval times in Europe. In fact,surveys of such structures seen in Measurements of the Gods confirmed thevalidity of the assessment.Deluge develops its themes over a number of chapters and includes some Indianastronomy and a completely new and verifiable interpretation of the India yugas;traditionally vast time periods of many millions of years. The concept was basedon a lunar construct. These values then link to the pole star periods seen inearlier chapters. The dating seen here is confirmed via Indian descriptions ofclimatic events that are recorded in ice cores and are well documented. Hencenot only dating, but the whole interpretation of the yugas, is confirmed as wellas the ability to record accurate observational astronomy in the distant past.A number of concepts of creation are included, such as those from China,Mesopotamia, and Egypt, for comparison to the biblical and Indianinterpretations. It is noted that, once more, there are a number of valuesassociated with lunar counts—as indeed can be seen in the Genesis flood talewhere Noah was afloat for a synodic year or lunar period.A chapter dealing primarily with biblical verses from the Books of Daniel andRevelations is quite revealing, as here we see that the whole pole star sequencewas understood, not the timing between all the stars, but nevertheless, whilethis period was a canonical 3,600 years, it is seen that after the demise ofPolaris, a shorter period ensues to the next star. We also show why the conceptof the number of the beast is erroneous. The operative value here is 36, whichis the last to count to reach 666. The punctuation in the King James version ofthe Bible is clear in this respect, and the triple value does not apply to thenumber of the beast. This “beast” is the flood period, devised because the seashad ceased rising and an evil was still required to explain when a pole star wasmisplaced. Much of Revelations, in fact, revolves around the demise andreinstatement of a pole star.Plato’s Atlantis is seen for what it is, a replication of the same story withhis “beyond the pillars of Hercules” being a reference not to a location but toa time, a time before 7600 BCE, a time when Vega had moved out of place and TauHercules had yet to take position as the pole star. Here there is much detailthat irrefutably confirms the evaluation.In essence, this book reveals the truth behind the mysteries of both the floodrecorded in the religious annals and Plato’s tale of Atlantis. The work revealsthat this is a cyclic situation (three floods are mentioned in Genesis), but thesequence and allegory has to be understood before these cycles are comprehended.The imaginative father of Western philosophy, Plato was giving a historicalastronomy lesson in his Atlantis story. A great deal of other directly relatedinformation is revealed via the investigations given in thisfive-hundred-plus-page work, but in a nutshell, this is Deluge: From Genesis toAtlantis.MEASUREMENTS OF THE GODSIt’s clear that observational astronomy was a reality in the distant past, withwritten records of events in the seventh millennium BCE (in the Mahabharata) andcorrelations in myth that show the skies were closely watched around 12,000 to13, 000 BCE. What else is there to be derived from these distant epochs?Deluge takes us from recent centuries back to 12,000 to 13,000 BCE. Measurementsof the Gods commences in the twentieth century and ends just the other side of9000 BCE. The journeys end again at Sundaland. As with Deluge; Measurements ofthe Gods confirms the abilities of the sages of India, long before Egypt becamea coherent nation. What follows is a very brief overview of the contents of thisbook.As the title suggests, the primary subject is measurement, and here we havefurther evidence of the abilities of our distant forebears. This book coversmuch that contradicts conventional thinking; the work brings together disparatebits and pieces and shows them as parts of a coherent whole. Measurements havebeen frequently used symbolically, as is revealed in Deluge; Measurements of theGods gives the history of these measurements. The book reveals the ancientsource of the British imperial system (extended from John Neal’s evaluations)and the numerous other units that were in use up to the onset of the metricsystem in France and their use on ancient buildings, such as in Egypt, and notso ancient, including the American White House and the George WashingtonMonument. Also reviewed is the application of these measurements in maps andcharts used by people such as Piri Reis and Columbus.We relate the confusion that reigned in Greece regarding the size of Earth andsteer a course through that recorded chaos of measurement. Also reviewed is theIndian weights system, the basics of which spread to the rest of the world. Ofcourse, we reveal the most fundamental elements of all: the relationships ofmeasurements to the lights in the sky—the gods—which is the source of allcalculations. Measurements of the Gods, indeed.Sequentially, Measurements of the Gods commences with suggestions of allegoryand calendars, a description of ancient measures and methods, the onset ofmetrication and modern Earth measure (with a comparison to John Michell’sevaluation) and hence to the records from Greece of Earth dimensions.From here, we move to maps and their scales as used by Columbus and Piri Reisfollowed by a more in-depth look at the ancient systems, which in turn isfollowed by a return to Noah’s ark and its representation in the Great Pyramid,a shortened version of the section in Deluge for those who may only read thiswork. There is some repetition of historical material later in the work for thesame reason.In the same chapter is a section on Stonehenge, its measurements and a calendarpreviously missed. The latter supplies a sound reason for the odd sarsen stoneclassified as number 11 and also a periodicity for the occasional wintercelebrations, which have recently been discovered to have taken place there.Silbury Hill is also analyzed in this chapter; our astronomical argumentsupplies a sound reason for the vast effort entailed in building the structure.Note that this does not involve sighting to any other point and accommodatessome other ideas that have recently emerged regarding the Stonehenge environs.The following three chapters deal mainly with measures and alignments across thelandscape in South Gwent, with notes to the effect that our investigations havefound similar situations in Somerset and Fife. These chapters are profuselyillustrated. Once more, little of this nature has been revealed in the past. Oneinteresting facet here is the replication on the ground via two stones and somehilltops of the forty days of rain in the Genesis flood myth, the loss of viewof the Pleiades, here dated via alignments of other sites to 2500 BCE againstthe biblical 2300 BCE. This is followed by an examination of numerous buildings,including the aforementioned famous American structures, and of course, in thiswe reveal the use of the ancient measures once more.Moving slowly back toward India, the following three chapters are of ahistorical nature, albeit with some new explanations, and these then lead us toarchaeology in India, the Maldives, and specifically Merhgarh circa 7000 BCE,with the most informative bricks ever discovered. However, other bricks are alsoinvolved in the evaluation, and there are three sets of sizes from differingregions and times in Indian development to take into consideration; these areamazingly accurate, and all connect metrologically to each other. There arehundreds of thousands of correlating examples from which mean values werederived by others, so we cannot argue with results. This is confirmation byrepetition—the scientific method.The next chapter confirms the calculations via the weights systems, whichinvolves a return to the biblical descriptions of Solomon’s Temple. This chapterreveals so many correlations and interrelationships that we cannot imaginereaders doubting the evaluations and hence confirmation of the statedmeasurement units. We follow this with a discussion revolving around Sundalandas a possible source for the measures, with the penultimate chapter being adescription of the measuring of Earth—in 9070 BCE! Here we describe the methodprobably employed, and once more a specific star is key to the dating. As thepeople of Merhgarh who made bricks complying with this Earth measurement camefrom Sundaland, confirmed via dental morphology, this appears to be aninevitable conclusion. It was here that knowledge of the size of Earth firstemerged. We are then left with a very short concluding chapter and references.In all, there are nineteen chapters and, again, over five hundred pages ofdetailed information, most of which is new and has not been in print previously.We feel that even though the argument and analysis and therefore conclusionscontradict conventional thinking, they are correct. Every effort has been madeto fault the arguments, but these attempts have failed, and as far as we candetermine, the results of the evaluations are accurate.CONCLUSIONBoth Deluge and Measurements of the Gods were twenty-five years in the making.The principal researcher and author initially became interested in the originsof the British imperial system and rejected as unsound the belief that ourmeasurements developed from Roman measuring systems—a theory trotted out inhistory books, in those odd volumes that managed to mention the subject.It was John Michell’s work that initially set the research on its path; althoughadmittedly we did not accept it until we had accrued quite a body of supportingevidence. These two books confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt that Michell’sevaluation of the ancient accepted circumference of Earth, a measurement thatstood until the French metric system was adopted, was correct. Our research intothe flood story revealed that the Bible used different measures to thoseevaluated by Michell. However, eventually a definitive set of measures emergedfrom this tale, and it was here that elements of time began to emerge as beinghighly significant. After a great deal of research and many years, it emergedthat counts of time played an essential role in these matters, an idea confirmedby Indian writings. The work had taken a very different direction to any we haddreamt of at its outset. Much of that which is seen today as being of religiousorigin is ultimately related to calendar counts derived from observationalastronomy or what we can legitimately term science.This lengthy, frequently tedious and frustrating, but absolutely fascinatingjourney eventually came to an end, and the culmination of that long trek is thetwo books described here, which together detail the project Megalith, Masonry,Myth and Measure."},{"pageContent":"T E NTHE ELECTRIC JESUSTHE HEALING JOURNEY OF A CONTEMPORARY GNOSTICJONATHAN TALAT PHILLIPSGNOSIS: THE NOT-SO-SECRET HISTORY OF JESUSIn December 1945, during the tail end of the most devastating war in humanhistory, a peasant named Mohammed Ali of the al-Samman clan stumbled upon anearthenware jar near limestone caves in the deserts of Upper Egypt. He feared anevil djin (genie) resided inside, but hoping for lost riches, he still openedthe jar. To his disappointment, twelve ragged leather-bound codices fell ontothe ground. He didn’t realize these 1,200 weathered pages contained a pricelesstreasure with dozens of lost Christian gospels that had been hidden away for1,600 years. Mohammed carried them home to his mother, who kept herself warmthroughout the night by feeding pages of what we now call the Nag Hammadilibrary to her fireplace.These fifty-two texts, with titles like the Gospel of Thomas, the Secret Book ofJames, the Gospel of Mary, the Origin of the World, the Gospel of Philip, theSecret Book of John, and the Sophia of Jesus, showed that Christianity from thefirst through the fourth centuries was much more varied than previously thought,comprised of diverse sects claiming “secret knowledge” of heavenly realms.Modern scholars now label these texts as gnostic, since they lay out aninitiatory process for candidates to overcome the “forgetfulness, drunkenness,blindness, and sleep” of the illusory world in order to access gnosis, directexperience or personal revelation of a divine reality.The Nag Hammadi library supported the popular theory that Christianity stemmedfrom the ancient mystery school traditions of the Mediterranean, which featureddying and resurrecting godmen. In Egypt, they worshipped Horus; in Greece,Dionysus; in Syria, Adonis; in Asia Minor, Attis; in Persia (and later Rome),Mithras; and in Israel, Jesus (historically the most recent). The similaritiesamong these hierophants were uncanny. Several of them, according to the legends,were born on December 25 around the winter solstice to a virgin in humblesurroundings (a cave or a manger) with a star in the Eastern sky. Some grew upto be spiritual masters with twelve disciples (Horus, Mithras, Jesus),performing miracles, giving baptisms and communions. They all died (Dionysusdismembered by Titans, Attis and Adonis eaten by wild boars, and Horus, Mithras,and Jesus crucified) before experiencing a miraculous resurrection.In The Jesus Mysteries, authors Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy discuss how theVatican sits atop a destroyed Mithraic temple.Where today the gathered faithful revere their Lord Jesus Christ, the ancientsworshipped another godman who, like Jesus, had been miraculously born onDecember 25 before three shepherds. In this ancient sanctuary Pagancongregations once glorified a Pagan redeemer who, like Jesus, was said to haveascended to heaven and to have promised to come again at the end of time tojudge the quick and the dead. On the same spot where the Pope celebrates theCatholic mass, Pagan priests also celebrated a symbolic meal of bread and winein memory of their savor who, just like Jesus had declared: “He who will not eatof my body and drink of my blood, so that he will be made one with me and I withhim, the same shall not know salvation.”¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3261_0]Freke and Gandy argue adamantly that there never was a historical Jesus whowalked the sands of Israel, but rather he is a composite of the earlier godmen.But perhaps that’s too hard of a line to draw, since mythical figures are oftenbased on real people—think of Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, forexample.As the Egyptian god of daytime, Horus battled his jackal-headed enemy Set (as insunset), the bringer of night, in a cosmic battle of light and dark. Jesusplayed a similar role as Horus in being “the light of the world” surrounded bytwelve disciples who represented the twelve months of the year, and the twelvesigns of the zodiac. The sun enters each zodiac sign at 30 degrees (30 times 12equals 360); thus, these “Suns of God” embarked on their ministry at the age ofthirty. The classic zodiac cross bisects the twelve astrological signs within acircle. The sun hangs “crucified” in the center as it passes through theprecession of the equinoxes, something the mystery schools followed closely aseach new sign marked the next world age.Given the astrological significance of the cross, wisdom traditions oftendepicted the crucifixion in their writing and art. A notorioussecond-to-third-century European talisman reveals a human figure that looks likeJesus on the cross (with a crescent moon and seven stars above him), but theinscription reads “Orpheus becomes a Bacchoi.” Orpheus was a prophet in theDionysian mysteries, and Bacchio refers to an enlightened disciple who hadundergone the final stages of initiation. Around the same time as the talismanhad been crafted, a Roman graffiti artist sketched on a pillar the image of acrucified donkey, which symbolized the initiates’ death to their animalisticnature and ascension to the higher self. The first portrayal of Jesus on a crosswouldn’t appear until two hundred years later.Rather than rejoicing in their similarities, “literalist” Christianleaders—those who had not experienced the secret gnosis (direct knowledge) ofthe highest mysteries—created dams and divisions between the diverse spiritualstreams that originally flowed from the same mystical source. As Freke and Gandyexplain, the parallels between Mithras and Jesus threatened the emerging“literalist church.” Roman bishops such as Justin Martyr, Tertullian, andIrenaeus made the ridiculous claim that the devil had engaged in “diabolicalmimicry,” “plagiarizing by anticipation” the story of Jesus before it hadactually happened in order to mislead the weak-minded.The Golden Bough’s Sir James George Frazer noted a similar contention betweenAttis, the mystery god from Asia Minor, and Jesus. “In point of fact it appearsfrom the testimony of an anonymous Christian, who wrote in the fourth century ofour era, that Christians and pagans alike were struck by the remarkablecoincidence between the death and resurrection of their respective deities, andthat the coincidence formed a theme of bitter controversy between the adherentsof the rival religions, the pagans contending that the resurrection of Christwas a spurious imitation of the resurrection of Attis, and the Christiansasserting with equal warmth that the resurrection of Attis was a diabolicalcounterfeit of Christ.”² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3263_0]Literalist Christians refused to accept that the rites of the mystery schoolsform the central narrative of the New Testament. But the similarities are tooplentiful to ignore. Jesus encounters a baptism (spiritual cleansing), aEucharist (communion), an anointing (Christ means “the anointed one”), and thedeath and resurrection ritual. These mystical rites provided a rare alchemicaleducation, unifying spiritual energies (pneuma, as the early Christians calledit) for candidates. In the words of the Gospel of Philip, one of the so-calledgnostic texts, “The Lord did everything in a mystery, a baptism and a chrism,and a eucharist and a redemption and a bridal chamber. . . . he said, ‘I came tomake the things below like the things above, and the things outside like thethings inside. I came to unite them in the place.’”The word mystery appears twenty-seven times in the New Testament with Paultelling fellow Christians, “Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants ofChrist and stewards of God.” Jesus speaks of clandestine teachings for those inthe inner circles when he says to his disciples, “You have been given the secretof God’s imperial rule; but to those outside everything is presented inparables” (Matthew 4:11).As an energy healer, I found myself especially drawn to how early Christiansused pneuma for personal transformation. Jesus baptizes with “fire and spirit,”heals with “power,” and transmits wisdom to his disciples through the “bubblingspring” drawn from a higher source. The purpose of these schools was to createpneumatics, people full of spiritual energy. In the Gospel of Thomas, Jesusannounces to his disciples, “Whoever drinks from my mouth will become like me; Imyself shall become that person, and the hidden things will be revealed to him.”Even common Christian terms reveal clues to this ancient transformationalprocess. I studied the original Greek word for sin, harmatia, which turned outto be an archery term meaning “missing the mark.” It lacked the guilt and shamepastors used to control their flocks and simply indicated when seekers strayedfrom their path and needed to get back on course. Similarly, the Hebrew wordsatan (adversary) highlighted the ego/personality attachment the soul needed toovercome to reach higher states of consciousness.Repent (metanoia) meant to “change one’s mind” or “have a shift inconsciousness,” which can occur when absorbing higher frequencies from someoneclosely connected to source-energy, like Jesus. Most surprisingly, Christ wasnot our Lord and savior but rather our soter, meaning “healer,” “bestower ofhealth,” or “one who makes whole.” Staying connected to universal spirit, Jesustravels through the rift of separation consciousness to heal us and bring usback to our celestial home. “I am the one who comes from what is whole” (Gospelof Thomas). When we finally release our attachments to the material realm, webecome redeemed; we experience apolytrosis, meaning “released.”Of course, I couldn’t help wonder what happened to the original meanings ofthese words, as well as the numerous gnostic churches that had proliferated inthe Middle East. When the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and its Second Temple in 70CE, after the Jewish revolt, they left one-third of the population dead and theChristian mysteries fractured into pieces. Members joined the mass exodus out ofthe country. Those who hadn’t been exposed to the inner mysteries started upliteralist churches. The remaining gnostics called these rigid sects “imitationchurches” as they did not teach the secret gnosis of the Christ within.According to the Apocalypse of Peter, literalist church fathers were “waterlesscanals” bereft of consciousness-expanding pneuma who arrogantly claimed to bethe sole gatekeepers of heaven. “Some who do not understand mystery speak ofthings which they do not understand, but they will boast that the mystery oftruth is theirs alone.” These “empty” churches sprouted up across the RomanEmpire. In a sad touch of historical irony, their leaders, like the infamousIrenaeus, the bishop of Lyon, became heretic hunters attacking those who stillcarried the inner teachings of their religion. “We were hated and persecuted,not only by those who are ignorant, but also by those who think they areadvancing the name of Christ, since they were unknowingly empty, not knowing whothey are” (the Second Treatise of the Great Seth).As the number of Christians multiplied in Roman lands, power-hungry Constantineswitched the state religion to co-opt this growing movement, uniting Rome under“one God, one religion” and, incidentally, one emperor. In 325, he oversaw theCouncil of Nicaea, where the church fathers reduced the vast library ofChristian written knowledge to a few documents that we now call the NewTestament.In 391, Emperor Theodosius passed an edict to close all “pagan” temples and burntheir books. Christian hordes set out on murderous rampages across the empire,smashing all traces of the mystery traditions from which their own religion hadblossomed. They killed off the last of the gnostic circles, including theirlibraries, churches, scrolls, and, most importantly, the flame of gnosis thathad been carefully passed down throughout the ages. By 410 CE, the Roman Empirehad nearly torn itself apart, and the Visigoths strolled in to finish the job.Only eighty-five years after the Council of Nicaea, the Dark Ages had begun.While poring over the lost gnostic texts of the Nag Hammadi library, I wassurprised how many of them focused on reframing the Garden of Eden story. Thesetales, like the Secret Book of John, explained the human origin story quitedifferently than Genesis. They described a complicated cosmology that began witha single being (or parent), who was ineffable, eternal, immeasurable light, andcreated an image or reflection of itself, Barbelo, which in turn begot amultitude of heavenly planes (aeons) that were part of a wider divine realm (thepleroma).Christ was not just a man but a distinct aeon or larger divine being in thepleroma. Those who fully realized the mysteries became one with Christ, carryingthis high vibrational force inside them. Bedazzled by the cosmic palace, Sophia,the aeon of wisdom, created her own world without consent from the über-parentor her male counterpart. This experiment went awry, and Sophia separated fromthe pleroma, creating a sinister Frankenstein ruler called the Demiurge(craftsman or maker), who manufactured our “counterfeit” material world.This was the Old Testament God, who gnostics called Yaldabaoth, Samael (God ofthe blind), and Saklas (a fool), as he believed himself to be the only god inthe universe, ignorant of the pleroma and the omnipresent light of the parent.Breathing life into Adam (and unknowingly the divine spirit of Sophia), theDemiurge ruled over humans with his demonic bully friends, the archons. Theangelic realms of the pleroma embarked on a rescue mission for both Sophia andAdam and Eve. Like an undercover agent, Jesus snuck behind enemy lines into theGarden of Eden, inviting the first humans to eat of the tree of knowledge (“theEpinoia of pure light”) to “awaken them out of the depth of sleep” and their“fallen state.”The gnostics’ description of archons immediately intrigued an activist side inme. These devilish autocrats seemed representative of the oppressive empiresthat dominated Western history books. Today’s Halliburtons and Bechtels, neoconsand Exxons, seemed to follow a long shadowy lineage of hierarchical powersprofiting from human suffering while expanding their empires. Maybe the gnosticsunderstood that we needed mystical agents of transformation smuggling incelestial light to liberate lost souls on the planet.And the Christ story seemed to be the perfect place to help free us from worldlybondage. I don’t think it’s an overstatement to say that millions of peopleliving today have been wounded or misled by literalist Christianity, robbed oftheir own divine spark. For more than a millennia, the Judeo-Christian traditionhas supplied the underlying operating platform for our whole society—ourlanguages, laws, mores, work ethic, sexuality, even our way of perceiving time(with the Gregorian calendar)—shaping our worldview, whether we realize it ornot.Integrating this tradition could prove a powerful tool in coming to terms withourselves, and our history. And that doesn’t necessarily mean plodding throughobscure gnostic texts, making sense of strange Demiurge names. The mysteries lieright there in the New Testament for those with “eyes to see” and “ears tohear.” But we need an upgrade of the Protestant revolution, one thatincorporates the gnosis of Christ consciousness. Imagine already establishedchurches, the ones on your block, enhancing their services with meditation,prayer, breathwork, energy healing, body movement, possibly even late-nightdancing, and, among the more radicalized churches, the ingesting of psychoactivesacraments in a safe and protected space. Why build entirely new systems forconnecting us to pneuma when the institutions have already been created, whetherMethodist, Lutheran, or Baptist? But these “waterless” religions would have togive up their addiction to dominating worshippers, address the evolution of thespirit, and infuse the essence of the mysteries into their hollow edifices.Many of the popular Eastern disciplines of today have us turning away from theworld around us, meditating on our navel. But Christ wasn’t only a yogi; he wasa mystical activist, carrying his message to those who most needed it. In thistime of great transition, our ailing planet needs spiritual warriors, onescapable of standing up to the Western materialist machine, so we can createsustainable societies that care for their citizens, harmonize with the cycles ofnature, and receive and honor the vast healing light that quietly connects usall."},{"pageContent":"E L E V E NMITHRAS AND JESUSTWO SIDES OF THE SAME COINFLAVIO BARBIEROIn 384 CE, Vettius Agorius Praetextatus, the last “papa” (acronym of the wordspater patrum or father’s father) of the so-called cult of Mithras died in Rome.His name and his religious and political appointments are found written in thebasement of St. Peter’s Basilica, together with the names of a long list ofother Roman senators, spanning a period from 305 to 390. The one thing that theyhave in common is that they all are paters of Mithras. As many as nine amongthem have the supreme title of pater patrum, clear evidence that it was here,inside the Vatican, that the supreme leader of the Mithraic organizationresided, at the side of the most sacred basilica of Christianity, erected byConstantine the Great in 320 CE. For at least seventy years, the supreme leadersof two religions that were always supposed to be competitors, if not swornenemies, lived peacefully and in perfect harmony side by side. It was the samePraetextatus, as prefect of the town, who, in 367, defended Damasus against hisopponents and confirmed him as bishop of Rome.Praetextatus often declared that he would willingly be baptized if the see ofSt. Peter was offered to him. Following his death, however, the oppositehappened. The title of pater patrum fell (today we would say by default) uponDamasus’s successor, the bishop Siricius, who was the first, in the Church’shistory, to assume the title of papa (pope). Together with it he also took uponhimself a long series of other prerogatives, titles, symbols, objects, andpossessions, which passed en masse from Mithraism to Christianity.We can only undertand this handover from the Mithraic pope to the Christian onein the light of what had happened in 383 CE, the year before. In that year, thesenate almost unanimously voted for the abolition of paganism and all itssymbols in Rome and throughout the Western empire. This vote has always puzzledthe historians because, in their opinion, the majority of the senators werepagans and represented the last stronghold of paganism against the irresistibleadvance of Christianity. This opinion, however, is utterly in disagreement withwhat during those same years the bishop of Milan, Ambrose, used to declare, thatthe Christians had the majority in the senate. Who is right, Ambrose or modernhistorians?The bishop of Milan was the member of a great senatorial family and closelyfollowed Roman events, so it is unlikely that he could be wrong on a matter ofthat kind. On the other hand, we cannot ignore the historians because writtenand archaeological evidence confirm that the majority of the Roman senators wereat that time paters of the Sol Invictus Mithras (the Invincible Sun Mithras),and therefore, according to common opinion, definitely pagans. What nobody seemsto have understood, however, is that the two cults or religions, Mithraism andChristianity, were all but compatible. And there is no lack of historicalevidence supporting that.The most significant of many possible examples is Emperor Constantine the Great.He was an affiliate of Sol Invictus Mithras and never disowned it, not even whenhe openly embraced Christianity and declared himself to be “God’s servant” and asort of “universal” bishop. His biographer Eusebius hails him as the new Moses,but Constantine was baptized only on his deathbed, and he never stopped mintingcoins with Mithraic symbols on one side and Christian on the opposite; he evenerected in Constantinople a colossal statue of himself wrapped up in Mithraicsymbols.As for the Roman senators, several contemporary sources, starting from St.Jerome, affirm that most of their wives and daughters were Christian. An extantexample is St. Ambrose, himself a pagan and the son of a Mithraic pagan (theprefect of Gaul Ambrose), according to historians, although there is no doubtthat his family was Christian and lived in a profoundly Christian environment.From his childhood, indeed, Ambrose loved to play the part of a bishop, and inthe year 353, at St. Peter’s, his sister Marcellina, still a young girl,received the veil of the consecrated virgins from Pope Liberius in person.Formally, however, he remained a pagan until he was designated bishop of Milan.He was actually baptized only fifteen days before being consecrated bishop. Thefact is that in that period, Christians destined for a public career werebaptized only at the point of death, or else when, for one reason or another,they decided to embrace the ecclesiastic career. This was normal practice. Thesenator Nectarius, who was designated bishop of Antioch by the council ofConstantinople in 381, was forced to postpone the consecration ceremony becausefirst he had to arrange his own baptism.After the abolition of paganism, all Roman senators became Christian overnight,starting with Symmachus who went down in history for his stern defense of“pagan” traditions in front of Emperor Valentinian. A few years later, in fact,Emperor Theodosius, the most fanatic persecutor of heretics and pagans,appointed him as a consul, the highest position in the Roman bureaucracy.How is it possible, one might ask, that people could follow two differentreligions at the same time? This is the essential point. There is an enormousand incredible misunderstanding (that in some way might be deliberate) about theso-called cult of the Sol Invictus Mithras, which is always presented as areligion that rose parallel with Christianity and was in competition with it.Some historians go so far as to maintain that this religion was so popular anddeeply rooted in Roman society that it very nearly won the race withChristianity.Yet there is absolute evidence that the so-called cult of Mithras in Rome wasnot a religion but an esoteric organization with several levels of initiation,which from the oriental religion had borrowed only the name and a few exteriorsymbols. For what concerns contents, scope, and operative procedures, however,the Roman Mithras had nothing in common with the Persian god.The Roman Mithraic institution can in no way be defined as a religion devoted tothe worship of the sun, no more than modern Freemasonry can be defined areligion devoted to the worship of the Great Architect of the Universe. Thecomparison with modern Freemasonry is quite appropriate and very helpful forunderstanding what kind of organization we are talking about. Actually, the twoinstitutions are quite similar in their essential characteristic. Freemasonry’sadepts are not requested to profess any particular creed but only to believe inthe existence of a supreme being, however defined. This entity is represented inall masonic temples as the sun, inserted in a triangle, and with a name—GreatArchitect of the Universe—that is the same given by the Pythagoreans to the sun.In these temples ceremonies of various kind and rituals are performed that neverhave a religious character. Religion is explicitly banned from the masonictemples, but every adept is free to follow whatever creed he likes in hisprivate life.A link between the Mithraic and the Masonic institutions is far from improbable,as there are profound similarities in the architecture and decoration of therespective temples, symbols, rituals, and so on; but it’s a theme outside thescope of this article. The comparison has been made only for the purpose ofstressing the point that Mithraism was not a religion dedicated to the worshipof a specific divinity but a secret association of mutual assistance, whosemembers were free, in their public life, to worship whatever god they liked.And yet all the adepts of Mithras apparently shared a common attitude towardreligion. This is a well-known fact. It is the same Praetextatus who exposes inan exhaustive way the philosophy of his organization in the book Saturnalia,written by Macrobius around 430 CE (well after the abolition of paganism). In along conversation with other great Mithraic senators, like Symmachus andFlavianus, Praetextatus affirms that all the different gods of the paganreligion are only different manifestations (or even different names) of a uniquesupreme entity, represented by the sun. This syncretistic vision has beendefined, with full reason, as monotheistic paganism.Most historians agree that the followers of Mithras were monotheists; what theyfail to underline is the fact that their particular syncretistic vision allowedthem to infiltrate and get hold of the cult (and revenues) of all pagandivinities. In fact, all Mithraic grottos harbored (exactly as the masonictemples of today) a host of pagan gods like Saturn, Athena, Venus, Hercules, andso on, and the adepts of Mithras in their public life were priests at theservice not only of the sun (who was worshipped in public temples, which hadnothing to do with the Mithraic grottos) but also of all the other Roman gods.In fact, all the senators who figure in the inscriptions at the base of St.Peters’ Basilica, alongside the titles of vir clarissimus (senator), pater, orpater patrum in the cult of Sol Invictus Mithras, also held a long series ofother religious positions: sacerdos, hierophanta, archibucolus of Brontes or ofHecate, Isis, and Liberius; maior augur, quindecimvir sacris faciundis, and evenpontifex of various pagan cults. They were also in charge of the college of thevestal virgins and of the sacred fire of Vesta. In the senate, there was nomanifestation of cult connected to the pagan tradition that was not celebratedby a senator adhering to the Sol Invictus Mithras. That same senator most of thetime was backed by a Christian family.So, what were they, pagan or Christian? The available evidence on this point isambiguous. Also the character of Mithras himself, as he is depicted by Christianwriters, is absolutely ambiguous. A long series of analogies exists between himand Jesus. Mithras was born on December 25 in a stable to a virgin, surroundedby shepherds who brought gifts. He was venerated on the day of the sun (Sunday).He bore a halo around his head. He celebrated a last supper with his faithfulfollowers before returning to his father. He was said not to have died but tohave ascended to heaven from where he would return in the last days to raise thedead and judge them, sending the good to paradise and the evil to hell. Heguaranteed his followers immortality after baptism.Furthermore, the followers of Mithras believed in the immortality of the soul,the last judgment, and the resurrection of the dead at the end of the world.They celebrated the atoning death of a savior who had risen on a Sunday. Theycelebrated a ceremony corresponding to the Catholic Mass, during which theyconsumed consecrated bread and wine in memory of the last supper of Mithras, andduring the ceremony they used hymns, bells, candles, and holy water. Indeed,they shared with Christians a long series of other beliefs and ritual practices,to the point that they were practically indistinguishable from each other in theeyes of the pagans and also of many Christians.The existence of a connection between Christianity and the sun cult from theearliest times is recognized by the church fathers, too. Tertullian writes thatthe pagans “. . . believe that the Christian God is the Sun, because it is awell-known fact that we pray turning towards the rising Sun, and that on theSun’s day we give ourselves to jubilation” (Tertullian, Ad Nationes 1, 13). Heattempts to justify this substantial commonality in the eyes of the Christianfaithful, attributing it to Satan’s plagiarism of the most sacred rites andbeliefs of the Christian religion.Constantine believed that Jesus Christ and Sol Invictus Mithras were bothaspects of the same superior divinity. He was certainly not the only one to havethis conviction. Neoplatonism contended that the religion of the sun representeda “bridge” between paganism and Christianity. Jesus was often called by the nameSol Justitiae (Sun of Justice) and was represented by statues that were similarto the young Apollo. Clement of Alexandria describes Jesus driving the chariotof the sun across the sky, and a mosaic of the fourth century shows him on thechariot while he ascends to heaven, represented by the sun. On some coins of thefourth century, the Christian banner at the top reads Sol Invictus. A large partof the Roman population believed that Christianity and the worship of the sunwere closely connected, if not the same.For a very long time, the Romans kept on worshipping both the sun and Christ. On410, Pope Innocentius authorized the resumption of ceremonies in honor of thesun, hoping with that to save Rome from the Visigoths. And in 460, Pope Leo theGreat wrote: “most Christians, before entering the Basilica of St. Peter turntowards the sun and bow in its honour.” The bishop of Troy openly continued toprofess his worship of the sun even during his episcopate. Another importantexample in this sense is that of Synesius of Cyrene, a disciple of the famousNeoplatonic philosopher Apathias, who was killed by the mob in Alexandria in415. Synesius, not yet baptized, was elected bishop of Ptolemais andmetropolitan bishop of Cyrenaica, but he accepted the position only on conditionthat he did not have to retract his Neoplatonic ideas or renounce his worship ofthe sun.In the light of all of this, how should we consider the position of Mithraiststoward Christianity? Competitors or cooperators? Friends or enemies? Perhaps thebest indication is given by the coins minted by Emperor Constantine until 320CE, with Christian symbols on one side, Mithraic symbols on the other.Were Jesus and Mithras two faces of the same coin?THE ORIGINS OF MITHRAISM AND CHRISTIANITYIn order to explain the strict relationship between Christianity and Mithraism,we have to go back to their origins.Christianity, as we know it, by universal recognition, is a creation of St.Paul, the Pharisee who was sent to Rome around 61 CE, where he founded the firstChristian community of the capital. The religion imposed by Paul in Rome wasquite different from that preached by Jesus in Palestine and put into practiceby James the Just, who was subsequently the leader of the Christian community ofJerusalem. Jesus’ preaching was in line with the way of living and thinking ofthe sect known as the Essenes. The doctrinal contents of Christianity as itemerged in Rome at the end of the first century are, instead, extraordinarilyclose to those of the sect of the Pharisees, to which Paul belonged.Paul was executed probably in 67 by Nero, together with most of his followers.The Roman Christian community was virtually wiped out by Nero’s persecution. Wedo not have the slightest information about what happened in this communityduring the following thirty years; a very disturbing blackout of news becausesomething very important happened in Rome at that period. In fact, some of themost eminent citizens of the capital were converted, like the consul FlaviusClemens, cousin of Emperor Domitian; in addition, the Roman Church assumed amonarchic structure and imposed its leadership on all the Christian communitiesof the empire, which had to adjust their structure and their doctrineaccordingly. This is proved by a long letter of Pope Clemens to the Corinthians,written toward the end of Domitian’s reign, where his leadership is clearlystated.This means that during the years of the blackout, somebody who had access to theimperial house had revived the Roman Christian community to such a point that itcould impose its authority upon all the other Christian communities. And it was“somebody” who perfectly knew the doctrine and thinking of Paul, 100 percentPharisaic.The Mithraic organization also was born in that same period and in that sameenvironment. Given the scarcity of written documents on the subject, the originand the spread of the cult of Mithras are known to us almost exclusively fromarchaeological evidence (remains of mithraea, dedicatory inscriptions,iconography and statues of the god, reliefs, paintings, and mosaics) thatsurvived in large quantities throughout the Roman Empire. These archaeologicaltestimonies prove conclusively that, apart from their common name, there was norelationship at all between the Roman cult of Mithras and the oriental religionfrom which it is supposed to derive. In the whole of the Persian world, in fact,there is nothing that can be compared to a Roman mithraeum. Almost all theMithraic monuments can be dated with relative precision and bear dedicatoryinscriptions. As a result, the times and the circumstances of the spread of theSol Invictus Mithras (these three names are indissolubly linked in allinscriptions, so there is no doubt that they refer to the same and onlyinstitution) are known to us with reasonable certainty. Also known are thenames, professions, and responsibilities of a large number of people connectedto it.The first mithraeum discovered was set up in Rome at the time of Domitian, andthere are precise indications that it was attended by people close to theimperial family, in particular Jewish freedmen. The mithraeum, in fact, wasdedicated by a certain Titus Flavius Iginus Ephebianus, a freedman of emperorTitus Flavius, and therefore almost certainly a romanized Jew. From Rome, theMithraic organization spread all over the western empire during the followingcentury.There is a third event, which happened in that same period, connected somehow tothe imperial family and to the Jewish environment, to which no particularattention was ever given by the historians: the arrival in Rome of an importantgroup of persons, fifteen Jewish high priests with their families and relatives.They belonged to a priestly class that had ruled Jerusalem for half amillennium, since the return from the Babylonian exile, when twenty-fourpriestly lines had stipulated a covenant among them and created a secretorganization with the scope of securing the families’ fortunes through theexclusive ownership of the Temple and the exclusive administration of thepriesthood.The Roman domination of Judea had been marked by passionate tensions on thereligious level, which had provoked a series of revolts, the last of which, in66 CE, was fatal for the Jewish nation and for the priestly family. With thedestruction of Jerusalem by Titus Flavius in 70 CE, the Temple, the instrumentof the family’s power, was razed to the ground, never to be rebuilt, and priestswere killed by the thousands.There were survivors, of course, in particular a group of fifteen high priests,who had sided with the Romans, surrendering to Titus the treasure of the Temple.For that reason, they kept their properties and were given Roman citizenship.They then followed Titus to Rome, where they apparently disappeared from thestage of history, never again to play a visible role—apart from JosephusFlavius, the one who undoubtedly was the leader of that group.Josephus was a priest who belonged to the first of the twenty-four priestlyfamily lines. At the time of the revolt against Rome, he had played a leadingrole in the events that tormented Palestine. Sent by the Jerusalem Sanhedrin tobe governor of Galilee, he had been the first to fight against the legions ofthe Roman general Titus Flavius Vespasianus, who had been ordered by Nero toquell the revolt. Barricaded inside the fortress of Jotapata, he bravelywithstood the Roman troops’ siege. When the city finally capitulated, hesurrendered, asking to be granted a personal audience with Vespasian (The JewishWar, III, 8,9; in full, The Jewish War refers to Flavius Josephus’s Books of theHistory of the Jewish War against the Romans, written around 75 CE). Theirmeeting led to an upturn in the fortunes of Vespasian, as well as in those ofJosephus: the former was shortly to become emperor of Rome, while the latter notonly had his life spared but not long afterward he was “adopted” into theemperor’s family and assumed the name Flavius. He then received Romancitizenship, a patrician villa in Rome, a life income, and an enormous estate.The prize of his treason.The priests of this group had one thing in common: They were all traitors oftheir people and therefore certainly banished from the Jewish community. Butthey all belonged to a millenarian family line, bound together by the secretorganization created by Ezra and possessing a unique specialization andexperience in running a religion and a country through it. The scatteredremnants of the Roman Christian community offered them a wonderful opportunityto profit from their millennial experience.We don’t know anything about their activity in Rome, but we have clear hints ofit through the writings of Josephus Flavius. After a few years, he started towrite down the history of the events of which he had been a protagonist, withthe aim, apparently, of justifying his betrayal and that of his companions. Itwas God’s will, he claims, who called him to build a spiritual temple, insteadof the material one destroyed by Titus. These words certainly were not addressedto Jewish ears but to Christian ones. Most historians are skeptical about thefact that Josephus was a Christian, and yet the evidence in his writings iscompelling. In a famous passage (the so called Testimonium Flavianum) in hisbook Jewish Antiquities, he reveals his acceptance of two fundamental points:the resurrection of Jesus and his identification with the messiah of theprophecies, which are necessary and sufficient conditions for a Jew of that timeto be considered a Christian. The Christian sympathies of Josephus also clearlyemanate from other passages of the same work, where he speaks with greatadmiration of John the Baptist as well as of James, the brother of Jesus.JOSEPHUS FLAVIUS AND ST. PAULThe arguments used by Josephus Flavius to justify his own betrayal and that ofhis brethren seem to echo the words of St. Paul. The two seem to be perfectly inagreement with regard to their attitude toward the Roman world. Paul, forexample, considered it his task to free the church of Jesus from the narrownessof Judaism and from the land of Judaea and to make it universal, linking it toRome. They are also in agreement on other significant points: For example, bothof them declare their belief in the doctrines of the Pharisees, which were thosethat were wholly received by the Roman church.There are sufficient historical indications to lead us to consider it certainthat the two knew each other and were linked by a strong friendship. In the Actsof the Apostles, we read that after reaching Jerusalem, Paul was brought beforethe high priests and the Sanhedrin to be judged (Acts 22:30). He defendedhimself:“Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrectionof the dead I am called in question.” And when he had so said, there arose adissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude wasdivided. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, norspirit: but the Pharisees confess both. And there arose a great cry: and thescribes that were of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, “We find noevil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us notfight against God.” And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded thesoldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them.Josephus was a high-ranking priest, he was in Jerusalem at that time, and hecertainly was present at that assembly. He had joined the sect of the Phariseesat the age of nineteen, and so he must have been among those priests who stoodup to defend Paul. The apostle was then handed over to the Roman governor,Felix, who kept him under arrest for some time until he was sent to Rome,together with some other prisoners (Acts 27:1) to be judged by the emperor, towhom, as a Roman citizen, Paul had appealed. In Rome, he spent two years inprison (Acts 28:39) before being set free in 63 or 64 CE.In his autobiography (Life, 3.13), Josephus says:Between the age of twenty-six and twenty-seven I embarked on a journey to Rome,for the following reason. During the period when he was governor of Judaea,Felix had sent some priests to Rome to justify themselves before the emperor; Iknew them to be excellent people, who had been arrested on insignificantcharges. As I desired to devise a plan to save them, . . . I journeyed to Rome.Somehow, Josephus succeeded in reaching Rome, where he made friends withAliturus, a Jewish mime who was appreciated by Nero. Thanks to Aliturus, he wasintroduced to Poppaea, the wife of the emperor, and through her agency, hesucceeded in freeing the priests (Life, 3.16).The correspondence of dates, facts, and people involved is so perfect that it isdifficult to avoid the conclusion that Josephus went to Rome, at his ownpersonal risk and expense, specifically to free Paul and his companions, andthat it was due to his intervention that the apostle was released. Thispresupposes that the relationship between the two was much closer than that of asimple occasional acquaintance. Thus, Josephus must have known much more aboutChristianity than is evident from his works, and his knowledge came directlyfrom the teaching of Paul, of whom, in all likelihood, he was a disciple.When Josepus returned to Rome in 70 CE, his master had been executed, togetherwith most of the Christians he had converted. His fatherland had beenannihilated; the Temple, destroyed; the priestly family, exterminated; hisreputation, tarnished by the stain of treachery. He must have been animated byvery strong desires for redemption and revenge. Besides, he probably feltresponsible for the destinies of the humiliated remnants of one of the greatestfamilies in the world—the fifteen high priests who shared his same condition.There is information about a meeting presided over by Josephus Flavius,unquestionably the strongest and most important character in that group ofpeople, during the course of which the priests examined the situation of thetheir family and decided on a strategy to improve its fortunes. Josephus lucidlyconceived a plan that, in those circumstances, would have appeared to anybodyelse to be the utmost folly. This man, sitting amid the smoking ruins of whathad been his fatherland, surrounded by a few humiliated, disconsolate survivorsrejected by their fellow countrymen, aspired to no less than conquering thatenormous, powerful empire that had defeated him and establishing his descendantsand those of the men around him as the ruling class of that empire.The first step in that strategy was taking control of the newborn Christianreligion and transforming it into a solid basis of power for the priestlyfamily. Having come to Rome in the entourage of Titus, and thus strong in theemperor’s protection and well supplied from an economic point of view, thesepriests could not have encountered great problems in taking over the leadershipof the tiny group of Christians who had survived Nero’s persecution, legitimatedas they were by the relationship of Josephus Flavius with Paul.Only six years had passed since he sought Paul’s freedom from Romanimprisonment. The apostle of the nations must have died at least three yearsbefore. Josephus must have felt a moral obligation to continue the deeds of hisancient master whose doctrine he knew perfectly, and sensing its potential forpropagation in the Roman world, he dedicated himself and his organization ofpriests to its practical implementation. Once he had created a strong Christiancommunity in the capital, it could not have been difficult for the priests toimpose its authority on the other Christian communities scattered around theempire—first of all, on those who had been created or catechized by Paulhimself.JOSEPHUS FLAVIUS AND THE SOL INVICTUS MITHRASJosephus Flavius knew all too well that no religion has a future unless it is anintegral part of a system of political power. This concept that religion andpolitical power should live together in symbiosis, mutually sustaining eachother, was innate in the DNA, so to speak, of the priests of Judah. It isunimaginable that he could think that the new religion would spread throughoutthe empire independently, or even in contrast to political power. His first aimwas, therefore, seizing power. Thanks not only to the millennial experience ofhis family, but also to his own experience of life, Josephus knew all too wellthat political power, especially in an elephantine organism such as the RomanEmpire, was based on military power, and military power was based on economicpower, and economic power on the ability to influence and control the financialleverage of the country. He must have envisaged that the priestly family wouldsooner or later take control of these levers. Then the empire would be in hishands, and the new religion would be the main instrument to maintain control ofit.What was Josephus’s plan to achieve this ambitious project? He didn’t have toinvent anything; the model was there: the secret organization created by Ezra afew centuries earlier, which had assured power and prosperity to the priestlyfamilies for half a millennium. He only had to make a few changes to disguisethis institution in the pagan world as a mystery religion, dedicated to theGreek sun god Helios, a name with undoubted assonance with El Elyon, the Jewishgod. He was represented as invincible, the Sol Invictus, to spur the morale ofhis adepts, and at his side was put, as an inseparable companion, a solardivinity of that same Mesopotamia from where the Jews had originated—Mithras,the sun’s envoy on Earth to redeem humanity. And all around them, in themithraea, were the statues of various divinities: Athena, Hercules, Venus, andso on. This arrangement was a clear reference to God the father and his envoy onEarth, Jesus, surrounded by attributes of wisdom, strength, beauty, and soon—well understood by the Christians but still perfectly pagan to a pagan’s eye.This organization didn’t have any religious purpose: its scope was to preserveunion between the priestly families and assure their security and wealth,through mutual support and a common strategy, aimed at infiltrating all thepositions of power in Roman society.It was secret. In spite of the fact that it lasted for three centuries and ithad thousands of members, most of them very cultured men, there isn’t a singleword written by a member about what was going on during the meetings of theMithraic institution, what decisions were taken, and so on. This means thatabsolute secrecy was always maintained about the works that were held in amithraeum.The access was evidently reserved for the descendants of priestly families, atleast at the operative level, from the third grade up (occasionally people ofdifferent origin could be accepted in the first two grades, as in the case ofEmperor Commodus). This system of recruitment is perfectly in line with thehistorical and archaeological evidence. Even at the peak of its power anddiffusion, the Sol Invictus Mithras appears to be an elitist institution, with avery limited number of members. Most mithraea were very small in size and couldnot harbor more than twenty people. It was definitely not a mass religion but anorganization to which only the top leaders of the army and of the imperialbureaucracy were admitted. Yet, we don’t know anything about the enlistingpolicy of the Sol Invictus Mithras. Did it recruit its members among the highranks of Roman society, or was the opposite true—that it was the members of thisorganization who “infiltrated” all the positions of power of that society?Historical evidence favors the hypothesis that membership in the institution wasreserved on a ethnic basis. Access to it, at least at the operative level, wasmost likely reserved for descendants of the group of the Jewish priests who cameto Rome after the destruction of Jerusalem.THE SOL INVICTUS MITHRAS CONQUERS THE ROMAN EMPIREWritten sources and the archaeological testimonies give evidence that fromDomitian on, Rome always remained the most important center of the Sol InvictusMithras institution, which had become firmly entrenched at the very heart of theimperial administration, both in the palace and among the Praetorian guard. FromRome, the organization soon spread to nearby Ostia, the port with the hightestvolume of trading in the world, as goods and foodstuffs from every part of theempire arrived to delight the insatiable appetite of the capital. In the courseof the second and third centuries, almost forty mithraea were built there, clearevidence that the members of the institution had taken control of tradingactivities, source of incomparable incomes and economic power.Subsequently, it spread to the rest of the empire. The first mithraea to ariseoutside the Roman circle were built, shortly before 110 CE, in Pannonia, atPoetovium, the main customs center of the region, then in the military garrisonof Carnuntum, and soon after in all the Danubian provinces (Rhaetia, Noricum,Pannonia, Mesia, and Dacia). The followers of the cult of Mithras included thecustoms officers, who collected a tax on every kind of transport dispatched fromItaly toward central Europe and vice versa; the imperial functionariescontrolled transport, the post, the administration of finance and mines, and,last, the military troops of the garrisons scattered along the border. Almost inthe same period as in the Danubian region, the cult of Mithras started to appearin the basin of the Rhine, at Bonn and Treves. This was followed by Britannia,Spain, and North Africa, where mithraea appeared in the early decades of thesecond century, always associated with administrative centers and militarygarrisons.Archaeological evidence, therefore, conclusively demonstrates that throughoutthe second century CE, the members of Sol Invictus Mithras occupied the mainpositions in the public administration, becoming the dominant class in theoutlying provinces of the empire—especially in central and northern Europe. Wehave seen that members of Sol Invictus Mithras had also infiltrated the paganreligion, taking control of the cult of the main divinities, starting with thesun.The winning move, however, which made success of the Mithraic institutionirresistible, was seizing control of the army. Josephus Flavius knew, fromdirect experience, that the army could become the arbiter of the imperialthrone. Whoever controlled the army controlled the empire. The main aim fixed byhim for the Mithraic organization, therefore, must have been infiltrating thearmy and taking control of it.Soon, mithraea sprang up in all the places where Roman garrisons were stationed.Within a century, the cult of Mithras had succeeded in controlling all the Romanlegions stationed in the provinces and along the borders, at a point that theworship of Sol Invictus Mithras is often considered by historians to be the“religion” typical of Roman soldiers.Even before the army, however, the attention of Sol Invictus had beenconcentrated on the Praetorian guard, the emperor’s personal guard. It is not bychance that the second known dedicatory inscription of a Mithraic characterregards a commander of the Praetorium, and that the concentration of mithraeawas particularly high in the area surrounding the Praetorian barracks. Theinfiltration of this body must have started under the Flavian emperors. Theycould count on the unconditional loyalty of many Jewish freedmen who owed themeverything—their lives, their safety, and their well-being. The Roman emperorswere somewhat reluctant to entrust their personal safety to officers who camefrom the ranks of the Roman senate, their main political adversary, and so theranks of their personal guard were mainly filled with freedmen and members ofthe equestrian class. This must have favored the Sol Invictus, which made thePraetorium its unchallenged fief from the beginning of the second century on.Once it achieved control of the Praetorium and the army, the Sol InvictusMithras was able to put its hands also on the imperial office. This actuallyhappened on 193 CE, when Septimius Severus was proclaimed emperor by the army.Born in Leptis Magna, in North Africa, to an equestrian family of high-rankingbureaucrats, he was certainly an affiliate of the Mithraic organization, havingmarried Julia Domna, sister of Bassianus, a high priest of Sol Invictus. Fromthen on, the imperial office was the prerogative of the Sol Invictus Mithras, asall emperors were proclaimed and/or removed by the army or by the praetorianguard.As far as we can judge with hindsight, the final objective of the strategydevised by Josephus Flavius was the complete substitution of the ruling class ofthe Roman Empire with members of Sol Invictus Mithras. This result was achievedin less than two centuries, thanks to the policy enforced by the Mitharaicemperors. The backbone of the Roman imperial administration was formed by newfamilies of unknown origin who had emerged at the end of the first century andthe beginning of the second; they were antagonistic to the senatorialaristocracy and traditionally opposed to the imperial power. They formed theso-called equestrian order, which soon became the undisputed fiefdom of the SolInvictus Mithras. For sure, most of the families of the fifteen Jewish priestsof Josephus Flavius’s entourage—rich, well connected and enjoying the imperialfavor—belonged to this order.The Sol Invictus emperors all belonged to the equestrian order and governed inopen opposition to the senate—humiliating it, depriving it of its prerogativesand wealth, and striking it physically with the exile and execution of a greatnumber of its high-profile members. At the same time, they started introducingequestrian families into the senate. This policy had been initiated by SeptimiusSeverus and developed by Gallienus (who, we must remember, was also the authorof the first Edict of Tolerance toward Christianity), who established by decreethat all those who had held the position of provincial governors or prefects ofthe praetorian guard (both appointments reserved for the equestrian order) wouldenter by right into the senatorial ranks. This right was later extended to othercategories of functionary, great bureaucrats and high-ranking army officers (allmembers of the Mithraic institution). As a result, within a few decades,virtually the whole equestrian class passed into the ranks of the senate,outnumbering the families of the original Italic and Roman aristocracy.In the meantime, the spread of Christianity throughout the empire proceeded at asteady pace. Wherever the representatives of Mithras arrived, a Christiancommunity immediately sprang up. By the end of the second century, there werealready at least four bishop’s sees in Britannia, sixteen in Gaul, sixteen inSpain, and one in practically every big city in North Africa and the MiddleEast. In 261, Christianity was recognized as lawful religion by the MithraicGallienus and was proclaimed the official religion of the empire by the MithraicConstantine at the beginning of the fourth century, although it was still in aminority in Roman society. It was then gradually enforced on the population ofthe empire, with a series of measures that culminated at the end of the fourthcentury with the abolition of the pagan religions and the mass “conversion” ofthe Roman senate.The final situation regarding the ruling class of the Western Empire was thefollowing: the ancient nobility of pagan origin had virtually disappeared, andthe new great nobility, which identified itself with the senatorial class of thelandowners, was made up by former members of the Sol Invictus Mitras. On thereligious level, paganism had been eliminated, and Christianity had become thereligion of all the inhabitants of the empire; it was controlled byecclesiastical hierarchies, coming entirely from the senatorial class, endowedwith immense landed properties and quasi-royal powers within their sees.The priestly families had become the absolute master of that same empire thathad destroyed Israel and the Temple of Jerusalem. All its high offices, bothcivil and religious, and all its wealth were in their hands, and supreme powerhad been entrusted in perpetuity, by divine right, to the most illustrious ofthe priestly tribes, the Gens Flavia (starting with Constantine, all Romanemperors bore the name of Flavius), in all likelihood descendants of JosephusFlavius.Three centuries earlier, Josephus had written with pride: “My family is notobscure, on the contrary, it is of priestly descent: as in all peoples there isa different foundation of the nobility, so with us the excellence of the line isconfirmed by its belonging to the priestly order” (Life, 1.1)By the end of the fourth century, his descendants had every right to apply thosesame words to the Roman Empire. At that point the institution of the SolInvictus Mithras was no more necessary to boost the fortunes of the priestlyfamily, and it was disposed of. It had been the instrument of the mostsuccessful conspiracy in history."},{"pageContent":"T W E L V ESTAR BEINGS IN STONE?A ROCK ART SITE IN CENTRAL SOUTH AFRICAGARY A. DAVIDUNDER THE SOUTH AFRICAN SUNAt the southern tip of Africa, equidistant from the Indian Ocean and theAtlantic, lies a high plateau known as the Great Karoo. This arid savannah aptlycalled the thornveld is dotted with camel thorn and umbrella trees. South of thefabled Kalahari Desert, the harsh region is still hot enough in summer fortemperatures to reach well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.The late summer monsoon rains drawn from the Indian Ocean sometimes collect insaltpans spread across the barren plains—then quickly dry up. Rainfall in thenorthern part of the Great Karoo averages only about eight inches annually.Thunderstorms are violent but patchy, with ribbons of rain sometimes evaporatingbefore reaching the ground—much like on the deserts of the American Southwest.However, the rainfall here was once sufficient to support a rich diversity ofwildlife: giraffe, zebra, wildebeest, hartebeest, eland, springbok, buffalo, andostrich. Along riparian areas rhino, hippo, and elephant roamed. Predatorspecies included lion, leopard, hyena, and wild dog.This unforgiving territory is the ancestral homeland of the San, sometimes knownas Bushmen, and the Khoi, the latter formerly called the Hottentots. In fact,the word karoo is a San word that means “land of great thirst.” Diffusionistarchaeologist Cyril A. Hromnik, who was born in Slovakia, educated at SyracuseUniversity, and lives in Cape town, South Africa, claims that the word karu isactually a Tamil term (Dravidian of southern India) meaning “arid country.”¹[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3267_0] Hromnik further believes that the Khoi(Hottentots), whom he calls the Quena, are descendants of Indian fathers andSouth African San mothers.² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3269_0] The San werebasically hunter-gatherers, whereas the later Khoi were pastoralists, herdingsheep and cattle. The San and their famous click language were introduced toWestern popular culture by the humorous movie The Gods Must Be Crazy and themore recent Disney film A Far Off Place.On the distant horizon flat-topped hills (koppies) of sandstone and shale alsoresemble the mesas of my home territory in the southwestern United States. Darkdolerite outcroppings strewn with mineral-stained, igneous boulders were perfectfor carving petroglyphs, or, as they call them in South Africa, rock engravings.In September of 2009, I had the opportunity to travel there to assist my friendand colleague Rob Milne with his rock art research.³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3271_0] He and I, along with his wife, Slava, visiteda site called Driekopseiland, an Afrikaans name meaning “three hills island.” Itis located on a working farm along the Riet River near the city of Kimberley inNorthern Cape Province. Little did I expect to encounter images in stone thatresembled the star beings carved by the ancient Hopi Indians of Arizona.We arrived on the vernal equinox (September 22) at about 5 a.m., when Orion wasjust reaching its meridian. Getting out of the car to open the farm gates, I sawboth Crux (the Southern Cross) and the brilliant Canopus for the first time inmy life—the second brightest star in the night sky after Sirius. The San, by theway, consider Sirius to be the grandmother of Canopus. A few rabbits and asteenbok (antelope) darted across the dirt road, as we made our way to the sitein the predawn chill. (Later in the day, we saw a warthog dash across the roadand a troop of mongooses scampering about and chattering. Surely a cobra musthave been nearby.)[../Images/img0088.jpg]Figure 12.1. The author Rob Miln, and San guide, Adam. Photo by BronislavaMilne.The Riet (Reed) River, a tributary of the mighty Orange River that flows intothe Atlantic, is lined with nonindigenous eucalyptus trees and reeds overfifteen feet high.*3 [../Text/ch23.html#anchor_3068_0] Driekopseiland containsover 3,500 engravings pecked or chiseled into a glaciated andesite “pavement”that parallels the river. The main part of this blue-gray slab is cut by naturalfractures, thin and straight, that divide the horizontal rock expanse intovarious sections or panels. The whole area is at least 150 yards long and 75yards wide (see color plate 6 [../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1567_0]).According to archaeologist David Morris, whom we later met at McGregor Museum inKimberley and who autographed his new book for us (see note 8[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3281_0]), over 90 percent of the petroglyphs aregeometric, abstract, or nonrepresentational: grids, meanders, dots, hatches,zigzags, concentric circles, ovals, spirals, star shapes, sunbursts, nestedfigures, and calendar wheels. Every foot or so we came across some bewilderingdesign deeply carved into a plane of stone so smooth it almost looked polished.Ranging in size from a few inches to a few feet, these perplexing petroglyphswere rarely superimposed—that is, one carved on top of the other.We even found a great number of Celtic crosses, which are equilateral crossesinside circles. South African scholar Brenda Sullivan comments on their meaning:This symbol has many names. It has been called the five-fold bond, the tree oflife enclosed within the circle of eternity, and more commonly, the Celticcross. Well, the Celts may claim pride of name, but this most ancient symbol hasbeen associated with the isangomas [medicine people] of Africa for millennia,and is still one of Africa’s most powerful signs of protection and communicationwith the Creator through the Shades.⁴ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3273_0]On a panel downstream from the main section of the site, we also foundpetroglyphs that represented a number of animals: eland, elephant, rhino,baboon, anteater, and warthog. We encountered a few human-shaped engravings cutinto the horizontal surface as well, which in some cases was as flat as a pavedroadway.Because rock art is difficult to date, the time frame of these images frozen instone is anybody’s educated guess. Estimates range widely—from between the tenthmillennium BCE and the end of the first millennium CE.[../Images/img0013.jpg]Figure 12.2. Dawn along the Riet River, South Africa.

Photo by Bronislava Milne.Whenever the Driekopseiland glyphs were incised, they certainly took a long timeto make. In other words, these labor-intensive markings were no idle doodling towhile away a hot afternoon. Andesite is a fairly hard mineral and is rated 6 onthe Mohs scale. Granite is a bit harder at 6.5 and quartz is only 7. Diamond isthe hardest mineral and rates 10 on the scale. Mined for thousands of years notfar from here, the holy “Stones of the Sun” were most likely used to carve thishard rock. In 1866, these valuable gems were discovered downstream from theconfluence of the Orange and Vaal rivers, and hordes of miners flooded the area.Kimberley, of course, is now home to the world-famous De Beers Corporation,whose “Big Hole” and museum Rob, Slava, and I later visited.But what is the meaning of these enigmatic dream symbols carved into thebedrock? David Lewis-Williams, cognitive archaeologist and specialist in SouthAfrican rock art, says that these engravings were not merely representations ofthe natural world or abstractions of inner space rendered on static stone.Unlike the modern artist’s canvas, they were instead “windows on otherworlds”—veils between the physical world and the spirit world. Like theinteractive screens of a sacred video game, the petroglyphs were in fact“reservoirs of potency” that came alive the moment the San peopletrance-danced*4 [../Text/ch23.html#anchor_3070_0] ⁵[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3275_0] in front of them.⁶[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3277_0]Lewis-Williams is also the major proponent of the theory that the geometricsfound at Driekopseiland were a depiction of the entoptics created by the opticnerve in the initial stages of an altered state. The shaman experienced thesevaried abstract shapes via intense drumming and dancing, sometimes inconjunction with hallucinogens. Just rub your eyes hard to get a mild sense ofthis phenomenon.Even the academic Professor Morris admits to the sacrosanct function of theengravings. “As a powerful portal between spiritual realms, a point ofbreakthrough perhaps second to none in the area, Driekopseiland would have beenthe kind of place where !Khwa was appeased, where protections were sought, sothat ‘the rain comes down gently.’”⁷ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3279_0]Like the Pueblo people of the American Southwest, the San distinguish between(1) “male rain,” or lightning, fierce winds, and thunderstorms that pummelEarth, causing floods, and (2) “female rain,” or gentle rains that slowly soakinto Earth.⁸ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3281_0] Morris believes that the ancientpeople who made these carvings conceptualized the river as the mythic watersnake*5 [../Text/ch23.html#anchor_3072_0] named !Khwa, a figure prominent in Sanmythology.The regular emergence and submergence of images from the waters of the Gama-!ab[San term for Riet River] seems to us a crucial element in the power of theengravings and, arguably, a key to their meaning. Like the body of a large beastliving in the depths of the river, the rock surfaces appear to rise from onemedium to another, glistening, striated and engraved. Using a related analogue,the artist Walter Battiss spoke of “great whales lying in the mud” of DriekopsEiland, their backs “decorated with innumerable designs.”¹⁰[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3285_0]Arching its engraved back, the giant snake breaks the surface of the water—thenplunges back into the stream. This vertical undulation has cosmologicalsignificance due to the fact that “to go under water” is a San trance metaphorfor death or to die.Likewise, the Hopi describe a subterranean water serpent known as Pálulukang,which lives in springs, waterholes, or rivers and controls thunderstorms andfloods (see plate 7 [../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1571_0]). Hopi cosmology alsoidentifies the underworld with a pluvial afterlife where departed spiritsreside.The late epigrapher Barry Fell had interpreted some of the more abstract symbolsat Driekopeiland as Libyan inscriptions written in Ogam script, one translationof which is as follows: “Under constant attack we have quit this place to occupya safe stronghold.” Brenda Sullivan amplifies Fell’s rendition: “‘Peoplesuffering. A time of death and suffering. People were forced to abandon theplace, and seek protection elsewhere’—either because they were attacked, orbecause of violent storms and flooding.”¹¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3287_0][../Images/img0008.jpg]Figure 12.8. Phallic engravings with cupules next to river (dark area to theleft)Although I am not psychic, as I sat in the midday sun at this site, a vaguesense of malaise and subliminal tension pervaded the atmosphere. Even my SouthAfrican friend Rob admitted he would not camp overnight there, due not to thedangerous wildlife but because of the evil spirits that potentially inhabit theplace even today. Maybe we were simply experiencing, to quote the South Africanauthor Laurens van der Post, “the ghosts of Africa which, as we all knew, walkednot at midnight but noon.”¹² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3289_0]Some of the most puzzling engravings that we found depicted humanoids with somesort of bizarre paraphernalia. What Rob has dubbed “the spaceman” is locatedadjacent to “the flying saucer” and “the rocket.” The protrusion from thisfigure’s helmet is somewhat similar to the cone-shaped nose on a Hopi kachina,or spirit messenger (see plates 8 [../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1575_0] and 9[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1579_0]; and plate 10[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1583_0]).[../Images/img0027.jpg]Figure 12.9. Left: Petroglyph of flying saucer ascending (?). Right: Petroglyphof cone-shaped rocket (?).The intimacy that many African tribes have with the celestial realm is presentlyconfirmed by a world-renowned Zulu sangoma (medicine man) and high sanusi(uplifter of the people), whose name is Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa. Unlike mostacademics, who seem to put up barriers between peoples and compartmentalize themfor study, Baba Mutwa continuously shows us the enduring but dynamic connectionsbetween continents. For instance, he sees direct parallels between NativeAmerican and African tribes.There is not a single nation among Native American peoples whom I visited in myjourneys to the United States that does not have cultural and linguistic linkswith Africa. Among the Hopi Indians of the American Southwest, I found a customwhere masked people, who are called Kachinas, come at certain times during theyear and conduct sacred ceremonies and bless the people. In the African countryknown as Zambia, there is a group of people who practice what is calledMackishee. People wearing elaborate masks, which refer to certain spirits, visitvillages at times and listen to confessions of the villagers’ sins. These“spirits” bless the people for the coming period of time and go on their wayagain.¹³ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3291_0]Credo Mutwa claims that creatures from a star in Orion once lived in prehumantimes on Earth and built a huge subterranean metropolis in the heart of Africa.Before human beings were created on this planet, there had existed a very wiserace of people known as the Imanyukela. These people had come from theconstellation known to white people as Orion, and they had inhabited our earthfor thousands and thousands of years. And that before they had left our earth toreturn once more to the sacred Spider constellation, they made a greatevacuation under the earth, beneath the Ruwensory [Rwenzori] Mountains—theMountains of the Moon. And deep in the bowels of Mother Earth, the Imanyukelabuilt a city of copper buildings. A city with a wall of silver all around it. Acity built at the huge mountain of pure crystal. The mountain of knowledge. Themountain from which all knowledge on earth comes. And a mountain to which allknowledge on earth ultimately returns.¹⁴ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3293_0]The Hopi also have a female spider figure named Kokyangwuhti, who usuallyassists people in their quests and was present during the origin of humankind.The Hopi, incidentally, acknowledge four races of people. Spider Grandmothergathered four colors of mud—black, white, yellow, and red—and mixed them withher saliva to create these four races, each with its own basic language. Humanswere, by the way, created in the image of the sky god Sótuknang (see plate 10[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1583_0]). In addition, the Hopi have many legends ofwhat they call “flying shields.”Rob Milne believes that the depiction of the eight legs would be superfluous,because the spider is stationary. Credo Mutwa claims that Orion is the spiderconstellation.[../Images/img0010.jpg]Figure 12.10. Left: Driekopseiland “spaceman” engraving next to trapdoor spiderand burrow. Right: The trapdoor spider, a nocturnal arachnid.One petroglyph that Rob showed me ostensibly looked like a sun symbol, with raysemanating from the circle. Then I flashed on another icon of a very differentsort and thought, “no, that can’t be it,” and put it in the back of my mind.There are seven rays in each hemisphere of the circle, corresponding to thepulsars (see figure 12.11, left). At the upper right is a circle that containstwo lines, corresponding to the hydrogen molecule on the plaque. The outercircle may contain thirty-three rays, but it is impossible to tell because therock surface is flaked to the immediate right of the circle.Later, I got a picture of NASA’s Pioneer plaque and compared it with theengraving with a radial pattern (see figure 12.11, right). Thesix-inch-by-nine-inch gold-anodized aluminum plaque shows the position of thesun with respect to the center of the galaxy and nearby pulsars. Carl Sagan andFrank Drake created it in an attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial lifesomewhere in the far reaches of outer space. Launched in 1972, the Pioneer 10and the Pioneer 11 were the first spacecraft designed to leave the solar system,and both carry duplicates of the plaque. It displays the then nine planets,including Pluto, which, by the way, was discovered at Lowell Observatory inArizona. It also shows the Pioneer spacecraft’s planet of origin, its trajectorypast Mars and Jupiter, and its slingshot past Saturn, outward from ourhelioheart. The radial pattern consists of fourteen lines made up of long binarynumbers that represent the periods of the pulsars. The horizontal line thatextends past the humans represents the sun’s relative distance to the center ofthe galaxy. A silhouette of the spacecraft in scale is juxtaposed to the humansso that relative size can be determined. The two circles at the top representthe fundamental state of the hydrogen atom, which acts as a universal clock. Theregular decrease in the frequency of the pulsars will enable extraterrestrialsto determine the time elapsed since each spacecraft was launched. In about twomillion years, the plaque should arrive at Aldebaran, sixty-eight light-yearsaway. Let’s hope that whatever intelligence retrieving this message in a bottleis not reading an elegy to an extinct civilization.[../Images/img0019.jpg]Figure 12.11. Left: Petroglyph with radial pattern. Photo is rotated so thenatural rock fracture bisecting the circle is horizontal. Right: NASA’s Pioneerplaque.Did the people who made this South African rock engraving, perhaps thousands ofyears ago, actually “remote view” the future and glimpse this image we createdin the late twentieth century, which is now bound for the stars? Were they incontact with an intelligence that knew about the Pioneer plaque from theirjourneys through space-time and wanted to convey its significance to indigenoustribes? Or is this all just a big coincidence?Countless hours were spent carving sacred symbols into obdurate stone. Theseinner visions of the spirit world had been received from both cathartic trancestates and quiescent deep meditation. The veil between the physical andnonphysical universes was extremely thin, and in many cases, the interactionbetween the two occurred right at the rock surface, which appeared as atranslucent and permeable membrane.Beyond the two worlds merging like dual circles of the vesica pis-cis are myriadrealities, world upon world. Some of these are stars with revolving planetsinhabited by entities whose technologies may be millions of years ahead of ours.Other worlds are purely interdimensional, with completely different laws ofphysics and ontological paradigms. As postmodernists thousands of years removedfrom San sensibilities, we must in the end admit that we are nothing butHoratios confronting this “wondrous strange.” At the end of the nineteenthcentury, one San informant reported: “We do not utter a star man’s name.”¹⁵[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3295_0]"},{"pageContent":"T H I R T E E NSERPENT OF THE NORTHTHE OVERLOOK MOUNTAIN–DRACO CONSTELLATION CORRELATIONGLENN M. KREISBERGThe stone constructions discussed in this article represent the discovery of apetroform, that is a purposeful arrangement in rock or stone that may begeometric, animal, or human in shape. Covering an area of several acres on asoutheastern-facing slope of Overlook Mountain in Woodstock, New York, agrouping of very large, carefully constructed lithic formations, when connectedtogether and taken as whole, appear to create a serpent or snake figure oreffigy. The large stone constructions, consisting of six very large stone cairnsalong with two snake effigies or serpent walls, are surrounded by a few dozen,much smaller stone cairns arranged in clusters and rows. Native Americanseasonal habitation sites have been documented nearby dating to 4000 years BCEand the site, in recent years, was visited by a Native American tribalpreservation officer who, along with many other individuals who have visited thesite, felt great awe, wonder, and deep respect for the ancient stone symbolspresent at the site. If the petroform is confirmed as authentic and constructedin antiquity, it can be inferred that the site was at one time (and still shouldbe) considered sacred. Additionally, because of the close correlation betweenthe two representations, it is proposed that the snake symbol petroform createdby the large lithic structure on Overlook Mountain may represent the starconstellation Draco (the dragon).HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SITEOverlook Mountain has long been an iconic image, looming above the Hudson RiverValley, acting as sentry to the easternmost woodland slopes of the CatskillMountains in upstate New York. Drawn to those slopes for thousands of years,humans have worked and roamed there as prehistoric hunter-gatherers, earlyagrarians, colonial lumber cutters and hide tanners, early American glassblowers and quarrymen, and twentieth-century utopians, hikers, and hunters. Withsuch a long and varied past, it’s safe to say Overlook Mountain can berecognized as a serial-use area: an area used by many different groups ofpeople, for many different purposes and reasons, for thousands of years.[../Images/img0006.jpg]Figure 13.1. Overlook MountainBeyond that, Overlook Mountain has inspired, enlightened, and invoked. From thepractical to the artistic and spiritual, the mountain has been the source andsubject of countless paintings, drawings, illustrations, meditations, poetry,and books, all seeking in some way to capture, experience, and ultimatelydocument the essence and nature of the tangible as well as intangible aspectsthe mountain possesses.There is little doubt an aspect of paramount importance to the early indigenousdwellers of Overlook Mountain and the lands surrounding, whose connection to thenatural world was both intimate and profound compared to this day and age, wouldhave been the relationship and connection between the mountain and the sky.[../Images/img0002.jpg]Figure 13.2. Indians historic markerMy interest in the history of Overlook Mountain began in 2004 when a cell towerwas proposed for the California Quarry, a historic bluestone quarry on the lowerslopes of the mountain, which operated from the 1830s to the 1890s. During thatperiod, the California Quarry, along with other, smaller, surrounding quarries,contributed greatly to early American industry and commerce in the region. Whileresearching the quarry property, I was introduced to the many stone mounds thatwere present on the 196-acre quarry property and nearby adjacent parcels. Earlyproperty deeds for the area show “ancient stone monuments” present from thefirst land grants, patents, and subdivisions recorded.[../Images/img0004.jpg]Figure 13.3. Bluestone quarry historic markerIn all, nearly five dozen cairns have been identified on the southeastern slopesof Overlook Mountain between an elevation of 1,100 and 1,500 feet. Most of thecairns are well formed and show deliberate construction techniques andpractices, such as dry stacking and the use of retaining walls. In some cases,it appears quartzite and hematite “donation” stones, which are not structural innature, were left on the piles.[../Images/img0022.jpg]Figure 13.4. Overlook Mountain cairnThe construction of the cell tower caused the destruction of five of the nearlysixty stone cairns present in the vicinity. In 2006 as part of the cell towerapplication review process, Sherry White, tribal preservation officer of theStockbridge Munsee Community Band of Mohican, visited the cairns and expressedthe belief that the larger of the structures could be a memorial or burialcairn. Having toured the entire site, it was her belief the Overlook Mountaincairn complex can likely be seen as a sacred precinct where local groupsconstructed memorial or burial cairns over successive generations, but it mayalso be part of more widely spread spiritual, ritualistic, and ceremonialpractices and beliefs. Due to the presence of cultural resources of historic(and perhaps prehistoric) significance at the site, a National Register ofHistoric Places application for the California Quarry property was prepared,submitted, and is currently in review and pending with the New York State Officeof Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.In 2008, members of the New England Antiquities Research Association (NEARA)visited the site along with researchers from the New York State Museum inAlbany. Museum GIS (geographic information systems) specialist SusanWinchell-Sweeney conducted a GPS site survey documenting the quantity andlocation of the remaining stone constructions. In all, six very large or greatcairns (up to 100 feet in length), forty-six small cairns (up to 10 feet inlength), two walls (90 feet long) in the shape of snakes, and two springs wereidentified and their size and location data recorded.[../Images/img0018.jpg]Figure 13.5. Overlook Mountain great cairnAfter receiving the plotted site data image from Winchell-Sweeney in late 2008(see figure 13.6), I initially made little of the distribution, concentration,or configuration of the several dozen plotted points. There did seem to bedeliberate groupings and clusters of the smaller cairns, while the great cairnsappeared to be spread about more randomly. But nothing really jumped out at me.It wasn’t until about a year later (late 2009), that I revisited the data imagewith the intention of connecting the dots.[../Images/img0020.jpg]Figure 13.6. GPS site survey[../Images/img0053.jpg]Figure 13.7. Image of the plotted GPS data points of the eight large lithicconstructions[../Images/img0017.jpg]Left: Figure 13.8. Northern Hemisphere star chart[../Images/img0046.jpg]Above: Figure 13.9. The constellation DracoMy good friend and fellow NEARA member David Holden, who had first introduced meto the cairns, had suggested that perhaps connecting the points could reveal apattern, which he believed, on a hunch, could depict the Pleiades star cluster.Somewhat skeptical, I decided to conduct the exercise of tracing the dots onto apiece of paper and comparing them to a star chart of the northernconstellations. Winchell-Sweeney’s data revealed there were eight large stoneconstructions seemingly randomly scattered about the mountain-side site, sixgreat cairns, and two snake effigy walls, each separate construction from fiftyto one hundred feet in length. I decided to start by tracing the point of thoseeight locations on a piece of paper. I then connected the dots with straightlines in the only obvious and logical manner possible.[../Images/img0034.jpg]Figures 13.10a and 13.10b. Figure 13.10a shows the original tracing of the cairnconfiguration, and 13.10b shows the flipped or mirrored version.By comparing the tracing to the constellations we see only one match that comesclose. The constellation Draco, known as the serpent or snake constellation, isa close match in shape, configuration, and layout to the positions of the stonemound constructions laid out on the ground. In fact, by mirroring the image ofthe cairn configuration, we see what appears to be an image of the constellationDraco reflected from the sky.[../Images/img0097.jpg]Figure 13.11. The Overlook Mountain–Draco constellation petroformIt should be pointed out that the eight points used to create the snake figurewere not “cherry picked” but were distinguished from the rest of the cairns bysize and the fact that the large construction (50 to 100 feet in size) appearsto be randomly placed as opposed to the smaller cairns (6 to 10 feet in size),which appear in organized rows and clusters. Sorting artifacts by features suchas size and relative position is, I believe, a standard method of classificationand in this case provides the basis for determining the stone mounds thatconstitute the petroform on Overlook Mountain.COMPARATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSISDraco is the eighth largest constellation, occupying over one thousand squaredegrees in the sky as it winds from the Pointers of Ursa Minor nearly to Vega inLyra. Yet it has no bright stars. Gamma Draconis, or Eltanin, the brightest starof Draco, has a magnitude of 2.2 and is one of three or four stars thattypically represent the head of the serpent. It is famous for being the starobserved by the eighteenth-century English astronomer James Bradley when he wastrying to detect parallax and so calculate the distance. Since the star Eltaninis considered the brightest star in the constellation, it is most likely to beseen as the star representing the head of the serpent on the Overlookrepresentation, which appears to be consistent between the two representations.The spacing and angle between the stars of the two representations, while close,is not an exact match, and the angle between Altais and Eltanin would alsosuggest that Eltanin is the single “head” star in the Overlook Mountainrepresentation of Draco, as opposed to Rastaban.The total number of stars that represent the constellation Draco can vary from 9to 14 depending on the culture on which the representation is based. Theconstellation Draco has 7 stars that are less than 10 parsecs (32 light-years)from the sun, has 3 stars brighter than 3.00 magnitude, and 6 that are currentlyknown to have planets. The total number of stars represented in the OverlookMountain–Draco constellation depiction is 8.I thought it might be interesting to compare the magnitude or apparentbrightness of the stars that comprise Draco to the size of the cairns on theground to determine if there is any correlation between size and brightness. Thechart below lists the eight brightest stars in the Draco constellation and theirapparent magnitudes. In the same chart is a list of the corresponding greatcairns and their respective sizes.[../Images/img0077.jpg]A description of the individual component constructions that constitute theOverlook Mountain petroform follows, beginning with the two snake effigy wallslocated at the highest elevation (1,420 feet) of the eight locations involved.The easternmost of these two walls would serve as the head of the larger,component serpent (Draco?) petroform. The two slightly curving stonewalls, eachapproximately 90 feet long, end at a large glacial erratic, which serves as ahead to each individual effigy form. It would appear the area around where thefigure’s mouth would be located on the glacial erratic has been worked toaccentuate the appearance of the mouth. The two walls, whose tails point towardone another, are located approximately 100 yards apart and are visible to andfrom each other when foliage is lacking, if one knows where to look. In fact itwas determined during a recent winter visit to the site that each of the largeconstructions is visible from the next nearest petroform component. The sixgreat cairns making up the remaining, lower portion of the petroform (between1,140 and 1,300 feet in elevation) range from approximately 60 to 90 feet inlength and are elongated and oval or crescent shaped. The three largest of thegreat cairns are curved or horn shaped and employ the use of retaining walls onthe downward slope to allow the high piling up of the stones within, in someplace to a height of 12 feet.[../Images/img0028.jpg]Figure 13.12. An image showing the location of the cairns described in the tableon page 1932. The arrows from GC2, GC3, and GC5 point toward the actualphotograph of these three great cairns.NATIVE STONE CONSTRUCTIONSAccording to Edward Lenik in his book Picture Rock: American Indian Rock Art inthe Northeast Woodlands, “Snakes or serpents are ancient symbols and appear inrock art sites across North America. They are considered to be creatures ofgreat power and craftiness. Among Algonquian speaking peoples, they may haverepresented evil and darkness or the energy of life or regeneration, or servedas vehicles of transition for the soul of the deceased to the spirit world.”Could the Overlook Mountain petroform function as a guardian of the pathwaysouls follow to the heavens? Lenik also associates the Algonquin mythicalthunderbird as a guardian of humans against the Great Serpent of the underworld.If the thunderbird is seen as the symbol of the protection of life, could theSerpent represent protection of the pathway of the dead?Accounts of Native American stone constructions associated with definiteastronomical attributes are not unique. Research in Manitou: The SacredLandscape of New England’s Native Civilization, by James Mavor and Byron Dix,went a long way toward proving that the Native culture of Northeast Americabuilt with stone and that many of these constructions were associated withastronomical alignments and observations. This should not be surprising asexamples of this apparently geographically diverse cultural practice are welldocumented throughout the Americas, and in fact worldwide.Examples of stone serpent effigy mounds (a wavy continuous line with snakelikeconfigurations) exist and have been documented. An apparent stone serpent effigyhas been found in Boyd County, Kentucky. Brisbin (1976) was the first todescribe this serpent effigy. Sanders’s (1991) article includes a nice drawingof the site and notes that it is “unique for its much larger size, well-definedserpent outline, strikingly bifurcated tail, and associated stone ring, whichmay represent an egg” (not dissimilar to the Ohio Serpent Mound). This effigy issaid to have a solar alignment in the configuration of the head and tail.Brisbin notes also that the sandstone forming the serpent was quarried locallyand that “in the head and coil portion, the stones are regularly piled to aheight of 12 feet, but in the area of the body, they are stacked about 4 feethigh and 5 feet wide until they thin out in the tail.” Sanders gives a littlemore up-to-date information on the site. It is owned by Ashland Oil, and thecompany has established a 90-meter buffer between the mound and a nontoxiclandfill, which serves an Ashland Oil refinery. The head of the serpent has beendamaged by both pits excavated into the rock by unknown individuals and by theconstruction of a radio tower access road.Additionally, specific examples of Native American petroforms matching theconstellations exist as well. In his paper “‘Star-Beings’ and Stones: Originsand Legends,” researcher Herman Bender argues convincingly for a petroform inWisconsin, known as the Kolterman petroform effigy, consisting of stone“stickman” formations constructed on the ground, which create human figuresknown as star beings. The effigy figures are said to be associated with theNative American thunderbird tradition and mirror on the ground theconstellations Libra and Scorpio as they appear in the night sky.Further research led to Professor Harry Holstein, of Jacksonville StateUniversity in Alabama, who has discovered apparent serpent effigy stone wallsassociated with archaeological sites he’s excavated in Alabama and Georgia.When researching Earth surface constructions that specifically reflect theconstellation Draco, I discovered there are examples from around the world,including the temples at Ankor Wat, in Cambodia, documented by Graham Hancock.It also turns out the well-documented Great Serpent Mound in Ohio, alreadymentioned as a serpent effigy, also conforms to the constellation Draco. Also, asite discovered and documented by Lee Pennington in Fort Mountain, Georgia, issaid to represent the serpent constellation. Lastly, I discovered that authorand researcher Phillip Callihan documented that the positions of the famousIrish round towers are configured to reflect the the northern constellation,including Draco. That all these sites are believed to be configured to representthe circumpolar constellation Draco is fascinating.In the case of the Overlook Mountain petroform, the comparison to the star groupknown as Draco cannot help but be made. I have consulted with astronomer KennethLeonard, who published “Calendric Keystone (?) The Skidi Pawnee Chart of theHeavens: A New Interpretation” and have confirmed the constellation Draco wouldbe visible rising above the summit of Overlook Mountain directly to the northbefore it reached its zenith overhead during daylight hours. And furtherconfirming the assertion, using Starry Night Pro computer modeling astronomysoftware demonstrates that Draco rose above the mountain on February 1, 2700 BCE(when Thuban was the pole star), just before sunrise. And, the serpentconstellation has continued to rise over Overlook Mountain, throughout the nightfor thousands of years since, occupying a position perpetually spinning aroundthe fixed celestial North Pole.This is significant because to early sky watchers living in the Hudson Valley,occupying lands stretching for miles to the south, east, and west, OverlookMountain would have been the place to look toward to see the serpent of thenorth rising, night after night, to fulfill its duties, protecting and making“precession proof” the heavens. This is important because by “precession proof ”I mean no matter where the celestial pole drifted over time (due to precession),the dutiful dragon would always appear wrapped around that point diligentlyspinning about the celestial pole, marking its location for those watching. Wemust remember that no star ever marks the exact celestial pole, which is thepoint in space where Earth’s axis points and which also draws a slow circle inthe heavens (over 24,000 years) due to the apparent wobble of precession. Whatwe consider the north star now, Polaris, is merely the star that closest marksthe exact, true celestial pole. This star changes over time due toprecession—more on this later.Besides the connection to the sky, the connection of this mountain to theserpent is also undeniable, and I don’t see this likely a coincidence sinceOverlook Mountain has the highest population of eastern rattlesnakes in New Yorkstate according to the Department of Environmental Conservation. It isestimated, based on the wear marks on the bedrock at the den entrances, thatsome of the rattler habitats have existed for centuries—at least. I think thisis significant given the reverence the snake was accorded by the indigenouspeople and helps complete the picture of the sacred nature of the mountain inthe culture of the Native population.[../Images/img0009.jpg]Figure 13.13. Comparing and matching the stars to the petroformSERPENT MOUND CONNECTIONDocumented images of snakes and serpents are not uncommon in the Northeasternwoodlands and elsewhere, and at least one significant Native American example isclaimed to have a connection specifically with the constellation Draco. It issaid the Serpent Mound of Ohio may have been designed in accordance with thepattern of stars composing the constellation Draco. The star pattern of theconstellation Draco fits with fair precision to the Serpent Mound. The fact thatthe body of Serpent Mound follows the pattern of Draco may support varioustheses. Putnam’s 1865 refurbishment of the earthwork was correctly accomplished,and a comparison to Romain’s or Fletcher and Cameron’s maps from the 1980s showhow the margins of the serpent align with great accuracy to a large portion ofDraco.Some researchers date the Ohio Serpent Mound earthwork to around five thousandyears ago, based on the position of the constellation Draco, through thebackward motion of precession, when the star Thuban, also known as AlphaDraconis, was the pole star. Alignment of the effigy to the pole star at thatposition also shows how true north may have been found. This was not known until1987 because lodestone and modern compasses give incorrect readings at the site.Most scholars date the Serpent Mound to the Adena culture, which flourished from1000 to 200 BCE. Though little details are known regarding the religious beliefsand rituals of the Adena, many believe that the Serpent Mound sat at the centerof their religious rituals and may have even served as a pathway forpractitioners to walk, chanting hymns and thanking their gods for the continuedfertility of the land and praying for its continuance.It has been documented that trading territories and routes of the Adena cultureextended along the southeastern shores of the Great Lakes, as well as theHudson, Ohio, and St. Lawrence rivers. So, it is likely some of the religiousand ritualistic aspects of the Adena culture diffused to the tribes of thoseregions and vice versa.DRACO AND MYTHOLOGYFrom antiquity, Draco has long been known as the serpent or snake constellation.For a period in human history, the star Thuban in Draco marked the north pointin the sky, as Polaris does now. This is a significant fact, which I’ll take acloser look at later in this article.Ophiolatreia, the worship of the serpent, next to the adoration of the phallus,is one of the most remarkable and, at first sight, unaccountable forms ofreligion the world has ever known. Until its true source can be determined andunderstood, its nature will remain as mysterious as its universality. It isdifficult to reconcile humanity’s worship of a creature that is generally foundrepulsive. Yet, there is hardly a country of the ancient world where it cannotbe traced, pervading every known system of mythology and leaving proofs of itsexistence and extent in the shape of monuments, temples, and earthworks of themost elaborate and curious character.Babylon, Persia, India, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), China, Japan, Burma, Java, Arabia,Syria, Asia Minor, Egypt, Ethiopia, Greece, Italy, Northern and Western Europe,Mexico, Peru, America—all yield abundant testimony to the same effect and pointto the common origin of “pagan” systems wherever found. Whether the worship wasthe result of fear or respect is a question that naturally enough presentsitself, and in seeking to answer it, we’re confronted with the fact that in someplaces, such as Egypt, the symbol was that of a good deity, while in India,Scandinavia, and Mexico, it was that of an evil one—a paradox that no doubtspeaks to the struggle between good and evil in humans and a duality pervasivein their nature and the nature of the universe.[../Images/img0083.jpg]Figure 13.14. Draco in mythology is most commonly depicted as a coiled snake.Snakes, dragons, and other similar creatures often played a role in creationmyths. In these stories, the gods would often battle such creatures for controlof Earth. When defeated, the serpents were flung up into the skies. To theBabylonians, Draco was Tiamat, a dragon killed by the sun god in the creation ofthe world. To the Greeks, Draco guarded the golden apples of the sun in amagical garden.In many early cultures, the serpent and the sun were strongly connected in theirbelief systems. Native American oral tradition relates how at one time peopleworshipped reptiles but were later compelled to recognize the sun, the moon, andother heavenly bodies as the only object of veneration. It’s said the old godswere secretly entombed in earthworks built to symbolize and represent theheavenly bodies.[../Images/img0025.jpg]Figure 13.15. Left: Serpent wall/snake effigy. One of two that are part of theOverlook Mountain Petroform. Right: Serpent effigy crafted in rock outcroppingon the author’s driveway.Serpents are a common feature in the art of the Late Prehistoric Period (900 CEto 1650 CE). As already mentioned, many Native Americans of the EasternWoodlands in North America believed the great serpent was a powerful spirit ofthe underworld. Serpent mounds and snake effigies may be a representation ofthese beliefs and hold a connection to the cosmos through the constellationDraco.In Reachable Stars: Patterns in the Ethnoastronomy of Eastern North America,author George Lankford’s volume focuses on the ancient North Americans and theways they identified, patterned, ordered, and used the stars to enhance theirculture and illuminate their traditions. They knew them as regions that could bevisited by human spirits, and so the lights for them were not distant points oflight, but “reachable stars.” Guided by the night sky and its constellations,they created oral traditions, or myths, that contained their wisdom and whichthey used to pass on to succeeding generations their particular worldview.However, they did not all tell the same stories or see the same patterns.Lankford uses that fact—patterns of agreement and disagreement—to discoverprehistoric relationships between Native American groups. In his research,Lankford devoted an entire chapter to the serpent in the stars, seen usually bythe Natives as the Scorpio or Draco constellations.The great constellation of Draco was seen and revered by most of the civilizedcultures and tribes of the Northern Hemisphere. The Nordics shaped their greatboats in the form of Draco the cosmic dragon. The Native Americans named theirtribes after it, and performed many dances to represent celestial movements. TheIrish Druids made good use of the symbol on their monuments. During the timethat Draco’s star Thuban was the pole star, it may have appeared to ancient skywatchers that Earth revolved around Draco. E. Valentia Straiton writes about themythology entwined with the serpent and the tree of life.A symbol of sacred knowledge in antiquity was a tree, ever guarded by a serpent,the serpent or dragon of wisdom. The serpent of Hercules was said to guard thegolden apples that hung from the pole, the tree of life, in the midst of thegarden of Hesperides. The serpent that guarded the golden fruit . . . and theserpent of the Garden of Eden . . . are the same.Kennersley Lewis also wrote of the connections between sacred trees, theserpent, and the acquisition of knowledge.[T]he nuptial tree, round which coils the serpent, is connected with time andwith life as a necessary condition; and with knowledge—the knowledge of ascientific priesthood, inheriting records and traditions hoary, perhaps, withthe snows of a glacial epoch.From these quotes we see that serpent worship was at the heart of humans’earliest religious beliefs. But the concepts involved were far from primitive.Consider the mythological serpent as a representation of the constellation Dracoand the tree of life as the pole or axis on which Earth spins. Through theassociation of the serpent and the tree, and the position of the stars relativeto Earth’s axis (precession), the importance placed on the certainty of thisrelationship by the ancients becomes clearer, as well as why any disturbance inthat relationship, metaphorically and perhaps literally, could portend a majorimbalance in the energy and natural cycles of the universe, with the resultsnearly always disastrous.THUBAN, THE ONCE AND FUTURE POLE STARAs mentioned already, due to the precession of the equinox, Thuban, the thirdstar from the tail of Draco, was the star closest to the North Pole, accordingto the naked eye, from 3942 BCE, when it moved farther north than Theta Boötis,until 1793 BCE, when it was superceded by Kappa Draconis. It was closest to thepole in 2787 BCE, when it was less than 2.5 arc minutes away from the pole. Thiswas at the height of the Egyptian dynastic era, and a shaft in the Great Pyramidat Giza points to Thuban as it was the pole star at the time the pyramid wasconstructed. Thuban remained within 1 degree of true north for nearly 200 yearsafterward and even 900 years after its closest approach was just 5 degrees offthe pole. Thuban was considered the pole star until about 1900 BCE, when themuch brighter Kochab began to approach the pole as well.Slowly drifting away from the pole over the last 4,800 years, Thuban now appearsin the night sky at a declination of 64 degrees 20 minutes 45.6 seconds, RA 14h04m 33.58s. After moving nearly 47 degrees off the pole by 10,000 CE, Thubanwill then gradually move back toward the north celestial pole. In 20,346 CE, itwill once again be the pole star.CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER INQUIRYIt can be said the configuration and layout of large stone constructions onOverlook Mountain, consisting of six large stone cairns and two serpentinewalls, when taken as a whole constitute a component petroform that resembles aserpent. Specifically, in form and composition, the Overlook Mountain petroformbears a striking similarity to the star constellation Draco. If the Overlookpetroform is not an intentional construction depicting the serpent constellation(Draco) that has risen over the mountain over the course of time for manycenturies, it is a remarkable coincidence. Either way, it appears the presenceof the cairn and serpent wall constructions are evidence of significant culturalactivity and resources.[../Images/img0048.jpg]Figure 13.17. Sky charts showing the pole star position over the course of time.Careful archaeological and geological inspection and analysis of the cairns andserpent walls could help provide answers as to the age and purpose of thoseconstructions. Studying the settled and compacted soil, particles, and pebblesbetween stones of one cairn and comparing them to others could help determinewhich of the structures is the oldest or the most recent. That, as well ascomparing lichen colony growth rates, from stones on the outer surface of thestructures to those on the interior, could help shed light on when the stoneswere first placed in the cairns and walls. Identifying when could help determinethe context within which they were built and the purpose for which they onceserved, if any.It’s reasonable to wonder: Were a people and culture present at the OverlookMountain site that created ritual and ceremonial constructions of stone,exploiting and manipulating the natural environment and materials found there,to express certain aspects of their belief system? Were landscapes routinelyidentified and modified appropriately to create relationships between the landand the sky, to venerate and preserve symbols and events associated withcelestial observation? Many examples of this have been identified, reported, anddocumented in the Northeast and elsewhere.Could this be more evidence of a diffusion of the Adena, mound-building cultureinto the Northeast region? After all, these are mounds we are talking about,albeit mounds made of stone in the Northeast. But then again, stone would havebeen one of the only materials available in this region for constructing mounds.Mounds made of stone instead of earth makes sense if there is no earth to use,yet mounds are what you wish to build. And, should we consider conversely thatthe megalithic mound-building concept and culture of the Adena may have spreadfrom the Northeast to the Midwest, having first arrived on our eastern shoresfrom Europe, in an early wave of migration? Until the full picture is known,this idea should not be ruled out.As has been suggested with the Serpent mound in Ohio, is the Overlook Mountainserpent petroform a representation on the ground, which is connected to theconstellation Draco in the night sky? The crucial question of whether Dracocurrently or in the past appears in the night sky above the Overlook Mountainhas been answered: it has and does. Now, how does it match up and align with theposition of the large cairns and effigies as laid out on the ground? Are theorientation—that is the direction, position, layout, andconfiguration—consistent with, matching, or close to the position of theconstellation in the sky above? Is there an actual, visual line up and alignmentbased on that orientation, and when does that occur? And, perhaps mostcritically, considering precession of the equinox, what was the position ofDraco above the site, going back hundreds or thousands of years? These are therelevant questions that remain to be answered about the site.Evidence for the veneration of the four directions—north, east, south, andwest—by the Native tribes of America is well documented, dating back to beforethe time of first European contact and as witnessed by many of the firstEuropeans to arrive. In many Native ceremonial practices, offerings are made tothe four directions, relating each to a season and many times a relative. Tothis group, the pre-European Native civilization of Northeast America, there wasno more sacred and important knowledge than in which direction to face to makesuch offerings. Keeping track of and preserving that knowledge would have beenan important task with both practical as well as ritual aspects, and everyopportunity and advantage would have been taken to do so. Knowing the truelocation of celestial north and tracking it over time would have been the key toaccounting for the celestial motion caused by precession, and this may have beenthe single greatest undertaking of the “big thinker” of those ancient days.Until further evidence is found, speaking to the identity and motives of theCatskills stone mound builders, it is hard to make a stronger case for acorrelation between the ground constructions on Overlook Mountain and the starsabove. However, further research into finding out how the constellations wereidentified by Native American northeasterners, particularly theAlgonquin-speaking tribes, and whether the existence and knowledge of theserpent constellation was present in Northeast tribal mythology, or if theyidentified what ancient Europeans called Draco as a serpentlike creature aswell. Such evidence could considerably strengthen the argument for a correlationexisting; a correlation, between Earth and sky, between the lithic constructionson Overlook Mountain and the serpent constellation in the stars above, markingthe position of the eternal, celestial north. Documenting and confirming thiscorrelation, this serpentine connection between the real and mythical, thegrounded and the godly, humanity and heaven would surely attest to the trulysacred nature of the site and provide a crucial clue to this unfoldingmystery—one most deserving of further investigation and serious, scholarlyattention.REFERENCESBender, Herman. “Star Being and Stones: Origins and Legends.” In Indian Stories,Indian Histories: Nova Americana in English.

I’m not going to talk about the famous Step Pyramidof Djoser (3rd dynasty, 2630 BC officially) built by his grand vizier, Imhotep,or of one of many mastaba; no, not this time. Instead I’ll let you discover oneof the most mysterious places in Giza and the whole of Egypt, the Serapeum,these strange catacombs.Look at the view from above. The entrance to the Serapeum is almost in astraight line well above the small pyramid of Userkaf and slightly on a diagonalabove the great Step Pyramid of Djoser (see figure 14.1, and see plates 11[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1587_0] and 12 [../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1591_0]).Figure 14.1 from 1957 clearly shows the entrance; but today, the ground in thisarea is so dug over, excavated by archaeologists’ concessions, that it isdifficult to see where the entrance is.[../Images/img0041.jpg]Figure 14.1. Satellite viewSome people, like Dr. Aidan Dodson, a professor of archaeology at the Universityof Bristol, do not hesitate to regard the Serapeum (in Greek Serapeion, formerlySinopeion) as the most important monument in the history of Egyptology. Thisextraordinary subterranean site was rediscovered first by the indefatigableGreek geographer Strabo, who traveled in Egypt around 24 CE, accompanying hisfriend, the Roman prefect Aelius Gallus, all along the Nile. It was he whoalerted us in his writings to the sandstorms that can dangerously take you bysurprise at the entrance to the site, concealed between two dunes, and bury youbefore you even find the door. He also mentioned the Avenue of the Sphinxes inparticular, which made a 2.7-kilometer-long path through the dunes toward theSerapeum. This was a very important clue that made it possible much later torediscover the site, which had disappeared from view, completely covered bysand.[../Images/img0039.jpg]Figure 14.2. The Greek geographer Strabo(57 BCE–25 CE)Then a great Italian traveler, Giovanni Gemelli Careri, seems to have seen or atleast approached it in 1693. He spoke of “a subterranean labyrinth” that he saw“not far from the pyramids.” But we think he saw other catacombs, not theSerapeum itself, or rather one of its extensions, because he spoke of corridorsrunning “for miles like a city under the ground.” He added that the Egyptians hehad met called this place the labyrinth, not to be confused with the famousaboveground labyrinth at Hawara in the Fayum area.[../Images/img0104.jpg]Figure 14.3. Left: The great Italian traveler Giovanni Gemelli Careri whoinspired Jules Verne and who went to Egypt in 1693. Right: Plan of part of theSerapeum.At roughly the same date, Paul Lucas, a French merchant who bought upantiquities on behalf of Louis XIV, found and visited the site and spoke ofgalleries already collapsed. I think Benoit de Maillet, consul of France inCairo from 1692 to 1708, also saw this place, but it was very difficult at thetime, when nobody could read hieroglyphs, to identify and understand it. Upuntil now, it’s been a great puzzle to researchers, perhaps even more so thanthe Great Pyramid itself. Also the place is closed to the public, and you need aspecial permit to enter. By visiting this site through this article, you’llenter a world of high strangeness; you can judge for yourself (see plates 13[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1595_0] and 14 [../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1599_0]).[../Images/img0061.jpg]Figure 14.4. Benoit de Maillet, French consul in Cairo in 1738Note in passing how the French became interested in Egypt, well before Napoleon.If anyone has given its letters of nobility to the Serapeum, it is our dearAuguste Mariette (1821–1881) who discovered the complex on November 1, 1850. Ifonly a few years earlier, Napoleon had searched frantically for the Serapeum,without success, it is because something special must be there. In fact,Mariette’s discovery, made almost by accident at first, changed his life, andafter this, he decided to devote himself to Egyptology. The discovery must havebeen of great significance to inspire such a vocation—another clue to theimportance of the site.In fact, Mariette had been sent to Cairo in the first place for a quitedifferent reason: He was commissioned on behalf of the Louvre to find andcollect Syrian and Coptic manuscripts from the patriarchs of the monasteriesstill in existence. Only problem was his mission soon became difficult becausethe English were in the process of snapping up everything. Competition wasfierce. It was even said that the English achieved their ends by getting themonks drunk: They then snatched the manuscripts from their precious archives,something that the honest and refined Mariette could never do. And then when youare surrounded by Egyptian monuments half visible above the sand and theexcavations have just started, it is not very appealing to attend to otherthings such as texts that are by definition on quite different subjects.Mariette had read the Greek Strabo, who described some of the Egyptian buildingsfirsthand. His description of the Avenue of the Sphinxes at Saqqara and themysterious Serapeum, to which access was virtually impossible, had arousedMariette’s interest. So he decided to take a look in the dune-covered northernpart of Saqqara. This was the right move because he soon came across a smallsphinx half buried in the sand, a prelude to the famous avenue leading to thefamous Serapeum. Given the competition, there was no time to lose. And so, as heloved to recount: “On 1 November 1850, during one of the most beautiful sunrisesI’ve ever seen in Egypt, with a group of thirty men working under my orders nearthis sphinx,” about a hundred of these small sphinxes on each side of an avenuebegan to take shape. As the days went by, a classic dromos, a sacred way leadingto an important place, formed before his very eyes.He soon came to what he described as a courtyard of the ruins of a small temple.There he found the famous statue of the seated scribe who is now in the Louvreand a statue of the god Bes, whose name means “to be initiated, to be born” andwhose ugliness was believed to repel evil forces. Eventually, on November 12,1851, a year later because of the tons of sand to be moved, he found lower downthe real entrance to the catacombs of the Serapeum. If you look closely atpictures of the site as it is now, the place is still totally buried below thelevel of the dunes. Mariette had to use explosives to break through the rock ofthe sealed entrance. He then entered a long gallery containing niches withvotive stelae and twenty-four side rooms, like alcoves, each containing a hugedark granite sarcophagus. These sarcophagi were nowhere near human scale, as toreach the top one has to climb a ladder of at least eight full steps; I checkedit myself. In addition, each sarcophagus, carved from a single block of granite,measures 4 meters long, 2.30 meters wide, and 3 meters 30 centimeters tall andweighs about 80 tons, proof of a remarkable feat of technology (see plates 16[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1607_0] and 17 [../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1611_0]).[../Images/img0005.jpg]Figure 14.5. Look at the enormous size of the sarcophagus.We are told that these sarcophagi are the tombs of mummified sacred Apis bullsof the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (664–525 BCE) up to the Ptolemaic period. These hugesarcophagi are therefore supposed to have been receptacles for the mummifiedbodies of bulls that in real life would not have been much more than 1 meter 60centimeters high over all and would have weighed as an adult about a ton at themost. The least one can say is that these granite sarcophagi were oversizedcompared to their supposed content. Strange, isn’t it? I will come back to this.We are also told that the granite sarcophagi are empty (it’s true, I was able tocheck on the spot). Supposedly their contents were looted in antiquity. Theywere thus found as they are now; that is to say empty, with no signs of anymummified bulls. Keep that in mind. Marietta also found that most of the lidshad been moved.He continued the excavations, and the following year he found other galleries,dating from Ramses II (1279–1212 BCE, Nineteenth Dynasty) and thus even older.This time they did in fact contain twenty-eight Apis mummies, but in small cavesand in wooden sarcophagi that matched the actual size of a mummified bull.Moreover, the bull mummies were always embalmed in the kneeling position likesphinxes, which took up even less space. The wooden sarcophagus of Apis XIVdating to the forty-fourth year of the reign of Ramses II has come down to usintact. We know from later texts (votive stelae did not exist at the time) thatduring the sixty-seven-year reign of Ramses II, seven Apis bulls were embalmed.Mariette then found a third network of rooms containing other smaller burials,dating from the time of Amenhotep III (1387–1350 BCE, Eighteenth Dynasty). Theonly wooden sarcophagi still intact were those of the Apis VII and the Apis IXdiscovered with ushabtis (funerary figures), canopic jars, and amulets. So theonly record we have is of a few bull mummies enclosed in wooden sarcophagi andseveral stone sarcophagi of normal size. But nothing about the twenty-four hugesarcophagi of granite.[../Images/img0092.jpg]Figure 14.6. Look at the height of the sarcophagus cover.At this point, a lot of questions raise their heads, but before I go into themany deeper, let’s look at something else: Why this worship of bulls? The wordSerapeum comes from Serapis, a composite god Sokar-Osiris-Apis created onpurpose by the late Pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter (305–282 BCE after the Thirty-firstDynasty). The pharaoh had a major problem to solve: he had to reconcile andunify two different cultures mingling in Egypt, Egyptian and Greek. Thus, thenew cult of Serapis was created, combining the ancient Egyptian cult of the Apisbull with the ancient Greek cults of Zeus, Hades, Asclepius, and Dionysus,trying to bring them all together into this composite god who representedfertility and the powers of the underworld.Yes, but before that? The cult of Apis was certainly in existence a very longtime before. According to Manetho, who I have already spoken of a lot, it wentback to the Second Dynasty. But for me and many other Egyptologists andresearchers, it is much older still, because many objects from the earliesttimes that show the importance of the bull in connection with the heavens havebeen found, for example the palette from the predynastic period of Naqada(4000–3000 BCE).So why the deified bulls? To the ancient Egyptians, the bull Apis contained thedivine manifestation of the god Ptah and later of Osiris. The Apis bull was thusthe actual receptacle selected by the soul of Ptah to come and incarnate onEarth. When Osiris later absorbed the identity of Ptah, he symbolized life indeath, that is to say, resurrection. The Osiris living in the underworld is alsothe Osiris of fertile vegetation, he who has conquered evil and death. All theseassociations between similar gods through the centuries, common in Egypt,actually have a very important meaning, a significance that sometimes containsmore than one secret. Thus the Babylonian god Ea was called Serapsi, that is tosay King of the Depths, which also relates to our Egyptian Serapis.But back to the god Ptah, the former Atum, demiurge, creator of the world, theone who shapes, who builds, the Divine Architect of heaven and earth, thepossessor of creative fire. On the Shabaka Stone it is said that Ptah “broughtthe world into existence.” The equivalent of Ptah for the Greeks was Hephaistosand for the Romans, Vulcan, also identified with Zeus. Ptah is representedstanding upright wrapped in the shroud of mummification, like Osiris, which tome clearly indicates that he resides in the underworld. He does not have thefreedom of movement that one has on the surface of Earth. He is a prisoner of aplace and a form that was not his in the beginning.The fact that he is wearing a blue cap (which the blacksmiths adopted later on)shows that he is invisible when on the surface of Earth (see plate 15[../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1603_0]). In ancient Egypt, the color blue indicatedthings and beings that were invisible. Thus Ra was originally depicted in blue,as was Amon. It is the blue of heaven, associated with the creative breath ofthe life. Ptah has mastered all the secrets of manipulation, which gives him thepower to dominate and shape all matter. A chthonic god, he reigns over theminerals in the depths of Earth. Another important link, he is also associatedwith Ta Tenen, the island rising out of the submerged land (which brings us backto the Great Flood, or to several of them). In any case, he is a god who waspresent when the first land appeared above the waters—and who perhaps in orderto manifest on Earth has to enclose himself in a form, so why not choose theform of the bull Apis?His consort was Sekhmet the powerful, great in magic, the feared and untameablelion. She was the guardian of the threshold, protector of the gods, the warriorthat Ra did not hesitate to send to punish the people on earth who no longerwanted any contact with the heavens and were cutting themselves off from thedivine. Some texts even give the impression that she had a part in unleashingthe Flood. Then in the Greek tradition, let us not forget that there is thedisturbing story of the nymph transformed into the cow Io by Zeus (associatedwith Ptah) and who, after an epic journey, ends up arriving in Egypt, where Zeus(Ptah) gives her back her human form and where she gives birth to Epaphus (theEgyptian Apis) and spreads the cult of Isis. The Egyptians associated Io withHathor, and according to some researchers, Epaphus-Apis became king of Egypt andfounded Memphis and was venerated as the god Apis. Strange, aren’t they, allthese interconnections? In any case, from this story we also learn that Zeus waswilling to turn himself into a bull at times. So here we have a divine being,Ptah, linked with the underworld, linked with the creation of the world or itsre-creation needed after the Flood, and his consort Sekhmet, who also has a linkwith the Flood.But what further explanation is there for the Apis bull and the sarcophagi inthe Serapeum? Let’s look at what we know from the texts. This descent of a godinto a body of animal flesh on Earth gave rise to all sorts of very strictrules.The choice of the bull used for the physical manifestation of the god was farfrom being left to chance. Judge for yourself: the bull had to be black with awhite belly, have a white triangular mark on its forehead, an eagle with spreadwings on its back, a crescent moon on its side, a scarab-shaped mark under itstongue, and a tail with long hairs parted in two. So it was a bull that waspredestined for the role.Herodotus even tells us that the Apis is “a calf from a cow that cannot bear anymore offspring. The belief of the Egyptians is that a flash of lightningdescends upon the cow and makes it receive Apis.” Priests scoured the wholecountry to find such a calf. Once he was found, he was carried down the Nile toMemphis by boat, housed in a magnificent golden cabin. There followed a greatcelebration because it meant that the living god had come to incarnate in thecountry; it was a tremendous honor and great joy.A seven-day feast was held to mark his entry into the temple of Serapis, afterwhich he had an easy life, with tasty delicacies and priests in his service, aharem herd available, music, jewelery to adorn him, and great popularity eachtime he was led out in grand style for festivities among the cheering people. Hewas so handsome that Plutarch wrote, strange as it may seem to us today, that“Apis is a beautiful image of the soul of Osiris.”There were further reasons for his popularity. Indeed, it was said that everychild who felt the breath of the Apis then had the ability to predict thefuture.Thus people crowded round him. In fact, Apis himself was consulted as an oracle.[../Images/img0098.jpg]Figure 14.7. A drawing by Paul Lucas, the great collector of antiquities forLouis XIV who traveled to Saqqara in 1700. The upper part gives a good idea ofwhat lies beneath inside the Serapeum.If he accepted the food you handed him, if he extended a particular leg forinstance—everything was matter for interpretation. He was also revered becausein the afterlife, anyone who was under his protection had control over the fourwinds. He was also apotropaic, meaning he was supposed to divert bad fortune.And as soon as one Apis died, the search for another one began.Also, according to my research, the Apis is linked to what is called the sign ofTanit. Tanit, of Phoenician origin, was a moon goddess of fertility, birth, andof the city of Carthage. Her shrine is at Serepta (still close to the wordSerapis) in southern Phoenicia, where she is associated with the goddess Astarte(Ishtar). And brace yourself, in Egyptian Tanith equals Ta Nit, which is to saythe land of Neith. The goddess Neith was another warrior, who also watched overthe mummy of Osiris; thus she is a goddess who fights and is connected with theunderworld and resurrection. There’s always this tangle of deities in differentareas and different eras.[../Images/img0060.jpg]Figure 14.8. One of several blocked-up entrancesBut if you look at the whole picture, it’s always about the same thing! Andeverything takes us back to Egypt. To help you understand why the Apis wasrelated to the sign of Tanit, first look at Apis as he was usually represented,gilded with the solar disc between his horns; then look at the sign of Tanit—thebull seen from the front represents the crescent moon (the horns), the sun (thedisc that he was always adorned with), and the pyramid (his triangular snout).According to the Phoenicians, the whole thing was represented by a personraising his arms in prayer to the heavens. I should add that in the secretlanguage of the Egyptian priests, the symbol of the sun meant look at what isfixed (the divine), and the symbol of the moon meant look at what is changeable,mutable (the incarnation). So we are faced with the notion of the animal beingthe very representation of prayer to the heavens, of the link with the divine,of the ladder to the sky. What other animal could serve so well as a link withthe gods?In addition, the design forms an ankh cross with the central line split in twoat the base, which some believe could be the ankh sign of life in its verydistant original form. A bull, then, as the symbol of life linked with the sky,linked with resurrection, and, better still, with ascension. We’re justbeginning to glimpse why so many important people have been interested in theApis and the Serapeum. The rites surrounding the Apis were considerable. Therewas even a rite of baptism practiced in Rome much later, when the cult of Apisgained much success. This ritual was very similar to the Christian one.What’s even more significant, the word bull is pronounced ka, exactly likeanother ka, the one that, according to the ancient Egyptians, represented aperson’s double and held his or her creative energy. Each living being had itsown ka, and the Egyptians said in the texts that to die is to pass into your ka.It is no coincidence that everything is a deliberate game in Egyptian writing.The ka was represented in hieroglyphics by two arms raised to the sky, a symbolseen also in the hieroglyph of the bull. So in the symbolic role given to thisanimal, the Egyptian priests revealed a favored pathway to the divine and ameans to reach eternity.CONCLUSION TO PART 1We are thus faced with a place that speaks of resurrection, ascension, andeternity, and one that is hiding more than a few secrets. To help you understandeven better the interest certain people have taken in this place, let me tellyou that Mariette’s first reports—the detailed discovery of each sarcophagus,each grave, each new underground passage, all through several years—havecompletely disappeared. Everything significant on the Giza plateau tends eitherto disappear or, if it can’t be moved, to be closed to the public.Among other things, all along the outer walls of the Serapeum there are dozensof openings more or less effectively sealed up, some with electric wires comingout of nowhere, overlooking places that one cannot visit, not even with specialpermission. On the inside, these places are walled off, hidden behind heavywooden panels and inaccessible. Since it was discovered some years ago that theworkmen repairing the corridors of the Serapeum were exposed to breathing inexcessive doses of radon (28.83mSv per year instead of the maximum of 10mSv peryear), the site has been closed to the public. However, I’ve seen the whole aircirculation system, and everything has been working wonderfully well for quite awhile.[../Images/img0056.jpg]Figure 14.9. Another blocked-up entrance with anelectric wire at the bottom[../Images/img0015.jpg]Figure 14.10. Close-up of the black electric wireSo I think the Serapeum will soon be reopened to the public, after the longperiod of repair it has undergone. On the other hand, it is clear that wholesections of it are not on the site map. We also know that in certain placeswhere the corridors have fallen in, it is still obvious that they carry onfarther and that the huge granite sarcophagi are impossible to move or totransport. Someone has already tried it with a big team and heavy equipment, andthe sarcophagus, slightly smaller than the others, is sitting right in themiddle of the return corridor, abandoned there because it could not be draggedany farther. We know also that these sarcophagi are proof of an incredibletechnology, and one wonders how they could have been brought here in thesenarrow underground passageways where cranes cannot go.I discuss this again in detail, but first I must tell you about the mysteriousImhotep, architect of the pyramid of Djoser, and about Prince Khasekhemwy, a sonof Ramses II who was one of the greatest priests and magi of all Egypt, andabout Aesculapius and the snake. Only then will you begin to glimpse what mighthave happened in this incredible place. And if you can, do go and take a look ateverything to do with the Apis bull in the Louvre or the British Museum.PART 2So, I’ve just been telling you about the incredible discovery made by Marietteon November 1, 1850, of the entrance to the Serapeum, this mysterious place atSaqqara on the Giza Plateau, with its complex network of underground tunnelscontaining a number of sarcophagi. These sarcophagi raise many questions, astheir existence represents a technological feat that cannot be explained intoday’s terms. I have also talked about the religious rituals that were carriedout around this place devoted to the Apis bull, which according to the ancientEgyptians represented the form in which the manifestation of the god Ptah/Osirischose to incarnate and which symbolized resurrection, the link with heaven, apathway to eternity.Before returning to the challenge of the sarcophagi, I will focus on anessential topic that usually fails to be addressed in discussions about theSerapeum: Imhotep/Asclepius. Remember the statue of Bes that Mariette found atthe beginning of his exploration of the entrance to the Serapeum? Note that thisbeing, revered for its oracles at Abydos, was also known to be a magician ofdreams; that is he inspired dreams that could then be interpreted. Egyptiansoften placed a statue of Bes in their bedroom. At the time, dreams were seen asan important means of therapy; a fact that is essential for understanding themeaning of the Serapeum. In ancient times, dreams were associated with healingand medicine.Remember that we are near the Step Pyramid of Pharaoh Djoser at Saqqara, builtby the legendary Imhotep some time before 2660 CE. Imhotep, whose name means“the one who comes in peace,” was not only chief minister of Djoser, thearchitect of the kingdom (the first in Egypt according to many scholars), highpriest of Heliopolis and grand magus, and chief of all the priests in northernEgypt, but also a great doctor (probably the first also) with his school ofmedicine and his temple next to the Serapeum. More than 2,200 years before thebirth of Hippocrates in Greece, still known as the father of our medicine,Imhotep in Egypt knew how to diagnose and treat over two hundred diseases, usinganatomical terms and practicing surgery.We can find hints of this in the famous Edwin Smith Papyrus. The greatEgyptologist James Henry Breasted says of Imhotep: “In priestly wisdom, inmagic, in the formulation of wise proverbs; in medicine and architecture; thisremarkable figure of Zoser’s reign left so notable a reputation that his name isnot forgotten to this day.” In the canon of Turin, Imhotep is designated as theson of Ptah. Apart from Amenhotep, he is the only mortal or hybrid Egyptian whomanaged to attain the full position of a god. The Greeks who settled in Egyptequated the Egyptian Imhotep with their god Asclepius, the god of medicine, andcalled Imhotep’s school of medicine the Asklepieion. It is quite possible thatboth Asclepius and Imhotep are one and the same person.But first, who was this Asclepius? Nothing less than the son of Apollo, theancient texts tell us, and of the nymph Koronis-Arsinoe. (Note in passing, thecity of Fayoum in the confines of the Giza Plateau is called Arsinoe.) Yetanother demigod? In any case, we are told that his cult, which had alreadyexisted on the island of Kos for a very long time, was introduced to Rome in 290BCE during an outbreak of plague. His temple was erected on an island in theTiber, and later it was confused with Serapis. You read correctly, Serapis. So,maybe the cult of Serapis is a later disguised version of a cult toImhotep-Asclepius! But what else is said about Asclepius? That he was raised bythe centaur Chiron (the last centaur on Earth according to the ancientGreeks—now that’s an “animal” that would fit quite well into our largesarcophagi) in an underground cave and was taught by him everything aboutmedicine and more besides, because Asclepius was not content just to heal but healso raised the dead. The god Zeus in his heaven, disturbed by Asclepius’senthusiasm for immortalizing earthlings and thus upsetting the natural order ofthings, finally struck him with a thunderbolt. Does this not remind you of howthe cow receives a flash of lightning before conceiving the Apis bull? The factis that Ptah is often connected with Zeus and with lightning.[../Images/img0040.jpg]Figure 14.11. Left: Asclepius. Right: The caduceus.Asclepius appeared in dreams to the priests and revealed to them the remediesfor their patients, or else the patients received them in a dream and werecured. He was shown with a rod with a snake coiled round it, the symbol ofmedicine (not to be confused with the caduceus of Mercury, with two snakessymbolizing commerce and communication). Asclepius had three boys and six girls,including Hygeia, Panacea, and Meditina. Meditina is of particular interest, asyou’ll see a little further on, for she was said to be a snake bearer. When Zeusstruck Asclepius, he was transformed into the constellation Ophiuchus, whichmeans snake bearer, also called Serpentarius—strange, isn’t it? AncientEgyptians taught that the gods when they died were transformed into aconstellation or a star. And as you’ll see, the snake plays a major role in theSerapeum. It is important to emphasize that our Hippocrates (the father ofmedicine, from whom we derive the oath our doctors take) is recognized as adescendant of Asclepius on his paternal side. Even if it is to him we owe thewords chronic, endemic, epidemic, convalescence, paroxysm, and so on, and thoughWestern medicine claims him as parent, in reality his concept of medicine wasvery different from ours. Dr. Houdant for example says that “the Hippocratictreatment is much more of a meditation on death.” In fact, Hippocratic medicinewas a carbon copy of that of Asclepius and was practiced in temples that hadcertain features in common. They had to have a temple-sanatorium at ground leveland subterranean caves with an underground spring. That is what we also havewith the Serapeum of Saqqara. In Athens, you can still see the sanctuary ofAsclepius today on the southern flank of the Acropolis, beneath the Parthenon,with its grotto and its spring. This grotto has since been taken over by theOrthodox Church.It is important for me to explain how Asclepius and his descendant Hippocratestreated their patients because they probably worked in the same way as Imhotepin the vicinity of the Serapeum. Besides their treatments with plant compoundsand apart from dealing with fractures and surgery, the heart of their medicineprimarily consisted of making their patients drink the water from undergroundsprings and bathe in it, because for them it was obvious that the water carriedin it the healing powers of the spirits of Earth. After that, they only dealtwith those who had the courage and determination to undergo the treatment.Patients had to fast and make repeated ablutions in the sacred precincts of whatwas called the Abaton; that is to say, in the temple, the caves, and theunderground passages, which no one else was allowed to enter. Then the patientswere made to sleep in the group dormitories of the Abaton so that they woulddream. There were specific rituals for encouraging dreaming; the deepest wisdomof Mother Earth was supposed to send the patient dreams revealing the reasonsfor his or her illness and how to treat it. The next day, the patient told hisor her dream to the priests who would then prescribe a treatment. It was alsosaid that the first image that came into the dreamer’s mind would become aguardian spirit and would never leave him or her.[../Images/img0082.jpg]Figure 14.12. Asclepius and his daughter HygeiaThe lesson to be drawn from this study of dreams was very sophisticated. Theydid not give a generalized interpretation of the dreams; they considered that adream symbol gave rise to a different meaning depending on the person. Eachperson was considered to have his or her own dream language, and detailed workwas done on the images and emotions of the patient. But Asclepius did not workonly with the priests of his cult; he was assisted by—guess what?—a horde ofsnakes. Nonvenomous snakes slithered all over the floor of the dormitoriesduring the night and were believed to be divinities who mediated betweenAsclepius and the patient. Because of the way snakes shed their skins, they werea symbol of rebirth and resurrection. (Incidentally, I can tell you that theword life in Chaldean is the same as for snake, and in Arabic, it’s the sameexcept for one letter.) Among the ancient Egyptians, the uraeus—the divine cobraon the headdress or forehead of the pharaoh—represented the life force with allits power, as it was supposed to strike with lightning any enemy or any negativeprinciple. However, they did not confuse this snake of highly positive qualitieswith the other—the serpent Apophis who brought chaos and negativity.[../Images/img0066.jpg]Figure 14.13. Hippocrates treating a patientAs a rule, the snake had the reputation of being invigorating and of bringingeternal youth and immortality. Why? Snake venom has powerful properties.Asclepius had a reputation for knowing how to administer doses of poison andantidote, including snake venom, with such skill that he was able to bring thedead back to life. He was known in antiquity to be a master of resurrectionthanks to his snakes. We now understand better why he was transformed into theconstellation of Ophiuchus, the serpent bearer. We can also understand betterwhy the symbol of medicine is a rod with an entwined snake. In the small Imhotepmuseum that has just opened next to the Serapeum and displays objects andstatues from in and around the Serapeum, what do we find? Snakes in all forms.The feet of a statue of Imhotep posed on beautiful painted snakes, carved cobrasthat covered the enclosure walls around the pyramid of Djoser, friezes of snakesin bas-relief found above the Serapeum, and so on—snakes everywhere (see plate19 [../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1619_0]).And what was Imhotep’s genealogy? His mother Kheredu-ankh was a mortal raised tothe rank of semidivine (like the mother of Asclepius) as she claimed that herfather was the god Banebdjedet, a ram god of fertility that the Greeks laternamed Pan.This very strange ram curiously had four heads, two facing backward, two facingforward. It was said that within it was incorporated the essence of the world infour forms representing the four spirits or souls (ba) of the four masters ofthe world Ra-Shu-Geb-Osiris (perhaps at a time when these four deities wereembodied together in a ram?). In any case, in Edfu, Banebdjedet was celebratedas one of the great ancestors. And at Mendes (Tell el Rub’a), there were foundsarcophagi (of normal size) containing mummified sacred rams. His wife was thefish goddess Het-Merit. In ancient Egypt, fish represent the transformation ofthe gods. Don’t you find that all this fits the same theme of metamorphoses andtransformations, of gods producing different frequencies and manifestations? Inshort, there’s a lot of similarity with Asclepius. Let’s not forget that theancient Greeks already disagreed about Asclepius, saying he was much older thanthe official dating was willing to say (even then). Linguists argue that thetrue meaning of the name Asklepios etymologically is “the hero of the mound.”Now all the sacred history of Egypt is based on a primitive mound raised abovethe waters.[../Images/img0063.jpg]Figure 14.14. BanebdjedetFinally, might not Asclepius and Imhotep be the same person? Do they not seemalike because of their semidivine origins, their concept of medicine, and thealmost miraculous power that they had over health, transformation and evenresurrection? In both cases, there is the use of a temple sanatorium (at Saqqaraarchaeologists know there was one next to the Serapeum like that of Alexandria)and of an underground network, all related to snakes. According to the Egyptianhistorian Ahmed Osman, the Serapeum was maintained and served by volunteermonks, who watched over the patients in the complex. “The followers of the cultof Serapis were supposed to be granted the right to eternal life without theneed of mummification if they showed devotion to the deity and went through aninitiation ritual that included baptism with water.” Is it not this sameimmortality that one is supposed to gain in Catholicism through baptism?On the other hand, we have a cult of metamorphosis, that of the sacred bull Apisas Ptah/Zeus/Jupiter honored among the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans.There are a large number of ancient writings on the many transformations ofZeus/Jupiter into a bull; for example, the whole story of Io (her other name isEuropa), who is transformed into a cow by Zeus, then arrives in Egypt, recovershuman form, and gives birth to Apis, who propagated the cult of Isis, foundedMemphis, and was worshipped as a god-pharaoh, as I mentioned in the first partof this article. Io was said to correspond to the goddess Hathor, which would bevery consistent. On the other hand, many Egyptologists equate Imhotep withThoth-Tehuti. The cult of Thoth resulted in a cult of the ibis, his preferredform of transformation, and there are catacombs filled with the mummies of thisbird beside the Serapeum of Saqqara as well as in Abydos.It is time to say something about one of the greatest magicians of all Egypt.More than a thousand years after his death, he was still considered a hero bythe Greeks and the Egyptians. He is the Prince Khaemweset (1290–1224 BCE), sonof the pharaoh Ramses II. Why was this prince so dedicated to the Serapeumduring his life? When Mariette had to use explosives to get through a large rockblocking the first gallery of the Serapeum, and in the rubble found a mummy witha golden mask with human features, he deduced that it could only be PrinceKhaemwaset. Certainly, his seal was everywhere on the objects and jewelery foundwith the mummy. However, a significant doubt remained. First, Mariette couldhave been influenced at the time by late stories attributing to the prince adesire to be buried with the bulls. Furthermore, certain things just didn’t holdtogether. Some Egyptologists think this mummy could very well be that of anunknown man buried in a crypt above the vault. Apparently, the wall of the cryptcollapsed under the impact of the blast. For others, much better informed in myopinion, this mummy, even though it had an anthropomorphic shape and goldfunerary mask with human features, in fact contained the remains of a bull thathad been given human shape, with jewelery and amulets bearing the name ofKhaemwaset.[../Images/img0033.jpg]Figure 14.15. Auguste MarietteWhy is there still a doubt? Well, simply because the mummy has vanished. Yes. Asusual, the really significant objects cannot be found. It is even moreunfortunate because Mariette’s detailed reports on the Serapeum have alsodisappeared, strangely enough. The fact is that Prince Khaemwaset did not onlycontribute to the enlargement of the underground labyrinth and oversee sevenApis burials in the Serapeum, but he showed a genuine devotion to this place.Why? Why did the fourth son of the pharaoh Ramses II undertake throughout hislife to restore the teachings of the great ancestors, those who had arrivedfirst in the land of Egypt? The prince was working to reestablish those aspectsof the tradition that were the most sophisticated, the most secret, and the mostmagical. Why did he, as we are told, at the end of his life live almost all thetime in the underground Serapeum?First of all, who was he? After a period of military honors—he was known to havebeen present at the famous Battle of Kadesh—he became a priest and then governorof Memphis and Grand Sem Priest of Ptah worship in Memphis. He was president ofall the craftsmen. He is often called the first Egyptologist in history becausehe carried out an unprecedented campaign to restore the ancient monuments of hiscountry, such as the Pyramid of Unas and a dozen pyramids and importantmonuments of previous dynasties. His passion for his country’s past made himinscribe on a statue, “I love so much antiquity and the nobility of the earliesttimes.” Very learned, he also had a huge library of documents on sacred andmagical subjects that aroused envy in the ancient world. He founded the libraryof the Ramesseum in Western Thebes, which contained only papyri about magic. Heis said to be, among other things, the author of the “Papyrus that producesterror and respect,” mentioned in the time of Ramses III.This attitude of collecting, of gathering evidence and knowledge of the past, ofrespect and maintenance of the tradition, in itself marks Khaemwaset as aconstant researcher of the hidden principle of divine intelligence and the humancapacity to rediscover it. His approach corresponds to the spirit of the godThoth-Tehuti, whom many experts now dare to think could be an ancestor ofImhotep, if they are not the same person. Much later, the Greeks claimed thatKhaemwaset possessed the famous Emerald Tablet of Thoth-Tehuti-Hermes, and theyalways called him the King of Magicians. Remember that in the third century,Clement of Alexandria considered Egypt to be the Mother of all Mages. Khaemwasetwas known for working against the Nubian magicians to prevent any foreigntakeover of Egypt. He was a great magical protector of the existence of thecountry and of pharaoh. In short, the prince was passionate about the mostsecret mysteries (see plate 18 [../Text/ch13.html#anchor_1615_0]).[../Images/img0069.jpg]Figure 14.16. Left: Prince Khaemwaset when young. Right: Prince Khaemwasetdepicted on the wall of his tomb.What do we learn from this? That one of the projects that he held closest to hisheart was to restore in his lifetime the practice of the Heb Sed Festival. Thiswas a great ritual festival that originally was to be celebrated every thirtyyears of the pharaoh’s reign so as to renew his accession. It was thecelebration of the jubilee. In fact, the prince reintroduced the Heb SedFestival in favor of his father Ramses II, who celebrated it fourteen timesduring his reign. Why? Well, because to initiates, Sed was in truth a greatritual of rejuvenation. No need to wonder at the incredibly long life in fullfitness of his father Ramses II, the pharaoh who lived the longest. In theoriginal form of the Heb Sed Festival, the pharaoh had to run naked in the fullsun and without food or drink, until sundown some say, around places thatsymbolized the different provinces of southern and northern Egypt. If he did notdie of exhaustion, that meant that he was reinstated in office by the approvalof the gods. After that came all sorts of secret rites enacted out of sight inthe holy of holies of the temple, including invigorating rituals ofrejuvenation. It is mentioned sometimes that the pharaoh had to spend a wholenight wrapped in a bull’s hide. If he could not stand the physical effort ofrunning, if he was taken ill, it was said that it was time for him to join hiska; that is, move on to the next world.As you see, being pharaoh was no easy job because the pharoahs carried theresponsibility for the cohesive force of the world on their shoulders—at leastthe earliest pharaohs did—and they absolutely had to be equal to the task. Theywere the bearers of the positive force, of the harmony of life, and had to keepthe upper hand at all times over the forces of chaos that threatened thepositive development of events, of things, and of people in the country. SoPrince Khaemwaset, a great expert on the Sed rituals, with uncommon powers andknowledge, passionate about medicine, rejuvenation, and resurrection, spent mostof his time in the corridors of Serapeum following the example of Imhotep or ofAsclepius. Why? Surely for something closely connected to his passionateresearch, don’t you think? In 1991, a Japanese team from Waseda Universitydiscovered north of the Serapeum a building containing 2,500 items bearing theseal of Khaemwaset.CONCLUSION TO PART 2For one thing, we have Apis bulls buried in small sarcophagi, usually made ofwood, that do not take up much space because the bulls are mummified in thesphinx position. Three have survived intact from the time of Khaemwasetincluding the Apis XIV, witness to the continuing worship of the incarnation ofthe god Ptah in a bull. This cult, dedicated to the metamorphosis of a god who,as the ancient Egyptians believed, took physical form on Earth, thus lasted avery long time. Then there is an underground place that was used to treat, toheal, and even to restore people to life with the help of live snakes. And thenwe have twenty-four huge granite sarcophagi that look nothing like any others.Apart from their exceptional size, each receptacle has a lid that alone weighstwenty-seven tons and fits perfectly. A careful observer will also noticenotches in the walls of the narrow niches where these sarcophagi are placed.These notches allow the 4-meterlong 30-centimeter-wide lid to be rotatedsideways on its central axis and to remain in position on the edge of thesarcophagus. This indicates that the sarcophagi were used open as often asclosed.What was kept inside them? Was there any liquid? Were the sarcophagi used in themetamorphoses of the gods, in their possible changes of frequency, in medicaltreatments with snakes, in a rejuvenation process? Were they the receptacles forgiants or were they used for the resurrection of the dead? We are told that theydate from the Eighteenth Dynasty. Guess what, this dating is based solely onbits of Eighteenth Dynasty pottery found nearby. Who are they kidding? By thattime, the art of stone carving was in rapid decline in Egypt. And there we havethese containers of eighty tons that are found nowhere else in Egypt or in theworld. Imagine the technological precision used to drill to perfection theseenormous thick troughs of granite in one piece, with corners that are perfectinside and out, exactly parallel. It’s just incredible, unequalled to this day,and represents an achievement way beyond the ordinary. In the words of theengineer Christopher Dunn, who went in 1995 to take measurements with properlycalibrated instruments, “Nobody makes such things without having a very goodreason for their design,” and “the tools used to create [these objects] are soprecise that they are incapable of producing anything other than perfectaccuracy.” We are far from the worker with a hammer trying to gouge out a lumpof stone. The surfaces of these huge containers are perfectly smooth withprecise and perfect edges, made from a solid block of granite of an unbelievablethickness. For many experts, this perfection is proof that a very advancedcivilization lived in Egypt for a very long time ago.These containers are completely smooth and devoid of any inscription, except fortwo partially inscribes ones. But when you look at one of the two inscribedcontainters, you see a wobbly and very inaccurate line and poorly drawnhieroglyphs in the design that was very common in the late period of falsedoors—a very clumsy effort. Now genuine inscriptions on sarcophagi are alwaysperfectly accurate; the royal scribes and sculptors had a total mastery ofwriting and of their materials, even in bas-reliefs. Writing that was flawedwould not have been allowed or tolerated on such objects. So at what point werethese writings added—perhaps quite recently? Has someone tried to make usbelieve, misguidedly and without success, that these objects are not so oldafter all? And why try to disguise the glaring truth, namely that these objectswere designed to be mysteriously smooth and without any inscription? Why wouldanyone want to turn them into ordinary items, when their dimensions speak forthemselves?Finally, last question: How were people in the old days able to transport thesevery heavy sarcophagi into these deep and narrow niches? In our time, as Idescribed at the beginning, a serious attempt was made to carry one of them upto ground level but after a few meters, it had to be given up. So, is it notreasonable to think that these sarcophagi were actually already there, longbefore Khaemwaset, as vestiges of a remarkable technology? They were revered forthe extraordinary purposes to which they had been put in the distant past—secretpurposes that a few rare scholars, like Prince Khaemwaset, still jealouslyguard."},{"pageContent":"F I F T E E NTHE CASE FOR THE DAEMONANTHONY PEAKEThe woman had settled down to a quiet evening in, curled up with a book. She wasengrossed in the story and at first was not sure what she had heard. It thenrepeated itself. It was a voice that was somehow inside her head and yet notpart of her thought processes.The voice was absolutely insistent. It had arrived from nowhere and was quiteclear about its purpose. It told her that she had a medical problem but that shewas not to worry because it was there to help her.After a few weeks of these strange communications, some of which whereprecognitive, the woman, known as AB, decided that her only course of action wasto go and see her doctor. The local doctor simply could not understand what washappening but assuming that the problem was psychological referred her to Dr.Ikechukwu Azuonye of the Mental Health Unit at London’s Royal Free Hospital. Inthe winter of 1984, Dr. Azuonye diagnosed a straightforward case ofhallucinatory psychosis. He prescribed a course of the antipsychotic drugthioridazine and expected that would be the end of it. How wrong he was.Initially, the thioridazine seemed to work. Thinking the voice was simply apeculiar psychological interlude, AB and her husband went off on a holiday.However, while out of the country, the voice had found its way through the drugbarrier and was more insistent than before. It pleaded with her to return toEngland as soon as possible, saying that she needed urgent medical treatment.Indeed it even told her an address that she should go to for help.The voice was now becoming quite precise concerning AB’s medical problem. Ittold her that it had two reasons for wanting her to have a scan: first, that shehad a tumor in her brain and, second, that her brain stem was badly inflamed.She convinced her husband that they had to go and find the address the voice hadtold her. Much to her surprise, and concern, the address turned out to be thecomputerized tomography unit of a large London hospital.This scared her so much that she went back to see Dr. Azuonye. The psychiatristwas, not surprisingly, reluctant at first to do as the voice requested. He knewthat the woman had none of the symptoms associated with a brain tumor and forhim to force the issue would reflect badly on his professionalreputation—particularly if he divulged the source of the diagnosis. Against hisbetter judgment, he agreed that he would write to the clinic and see what theysaid.A few months later, and after many letters, the clinic agreed to do the scan.Much to the surprise of all concerned, with the clear exception of the voice,the scan clearly showed an unusual mass in the brain.AB was called in to meet with a neurological consultant. The consultantexplained that the mass was probably a meningioma tumor. As he said this, ABheard the voice agree with this diagnosis. However the voice was concerned thatthere had already been too much delay. It demanded that she be operated onstraight away. Not only this, but the voice wanted the operation done at Queen’sSquare Hospital. This was because it knew that that particular hospitalspecialized in neurological diseases.This time the hospital authorities agreed, but the operation was to take placeat the Royal Free. The voice considered this and decided that it was acceptable.A few days later AB and, presumably, the voice itself were under fullanaesthetic and being wheeled into an operating theater.As AB came to after the operation, the first thing she was aware of was thevoice. All the insistence had gone. It said, “I am pleased to have helped you.Good-bye.”When the surgeon came round to see her, she already knew that her life had beensaved. He explained to her that he had removed a 6.4-cm (2.5-inch) tumor fromher brain. He added that he was sure that, had it not been removed, she wouldhave most certainly died.Over the years, this case continued to fascinate Dr. Azuonye. By 1997, he hadmoved to Lambeth Healthcare NHS Trust and had mentioned the AB case many timesto his associates. He found that the response was always either extremelypositive or extremely negative, and with this in mind, he decided to submit anarticle describing the event to the British Medical Journal. He was pleased whenhe received a positive response, and the article appeared in the Decemberedition.¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3299_0]Many hypothetical suggestions have been made as to what took place in 1984, butnone have been considered satisfactory. However, there is now a possible answerto the question of what was happening to AB.Who or what was this voice and how did it know what was about to take place? Howdid it know that AB was dangerously ill? How did it know exactly what the curecould be? And how did it know who would be of the greatest help? Could it bethat we all have a secret lodger in our brain—a being that has knowledge fargreater than our own?The central concept of my recent book The Daemon: A Guide to Your ExtraordinarySecret Self is exactly this: that all conscious beings consist of not one buttwo semi-independent entities—one of which knows what will happen in the future.In this article, I wish to present the evidence for such an idea. I will firstreview the philosophical, historical, and theological background to such abelief, and then I will apply some astonishing evidence from modern neurologyand consciousness studies that may show that such a belief may, in fact, betrue.THE EVIDENCE FROM THEOLOGYAlthough early civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians had a form of dualitythat implied more than a simple soul-body dichotomy, it was the ancient Greekswho refined this into a coherent philosophy. For the Greeks, human duality wasreflected in two beings: a lower, everyday self called an eidolon and animmortal, transcendental being called a daemon.Through the fascincating etymology of the word daemon (or daimone, as it issometimes written), a good deal is revealed about social and cultural history.The ancient Greek word was daimön, meaning deity or god. As such, the Greeksdefinition of the word was positive, or at least ambivalent. The RomansLatinized the Greek word, turning it into daemon. For the Romans, a daemon wasan inner or attendant spirit that sometimes gave humble man a touch of genius(hence the phrase the demon of creativity that is still used by people who neverseem to see how curious the statement is).The word eidolon also has an interesting philological history. Originally, thisword was used to describe an image or statue of a god. Eventually, it came tomean a copy of something divine; the copy looked like the original but lackedall its qualities. For the pagan sages, this perfectly described the part of thehuman duality trapped in the realm of darkness. This entity thus became known asthe eidolon, which is the embodied self—the physical body and the personality,the person him- or herself. This lower self is mortal and is totally unaware,unless initiated into the mysteries, of its higher self. It is very much part ofthe world of darkness. It is a slave to emotion and all the other ills thatbeset the physical being. The daemon, on the other hand, is the immortal self.This daemon is always with the eidolon and, where possible, tries to assist andguide.The idea of this daemon-eidolon duality fascinated the ancient Greeks, and soona whole philosophy of universal structure was around this relationship. Theearliest known writer on the subject was Empedocles. For him the daemon,although semi-imprisoned in the body, is a divine being exiled from its rightfulplace among the gods. It exists totally independently of its lower self, oreidolon, and has great knowledge and power.² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3301_0]However, our knowledge of this interesting belief really comes from the writingsof Plato and his descriptions of the teachings of his master, the famedSocrates.Plato reports that throughout his life his great teacher had assistance from aguide. Socrates called this discarnate voice his Divine Sign. From childhood,this voice had communicated to him its opinions on what he was doing or intendedto do. According to Plato, this voice forbade Socrates from doing certain thingsand regularly gave prognostications on whether good or bad luck would follow acertain action. It is as if Socrates’s Divine Sign was directly aware of thephilosopher’s potential future. Plato was at great pains to point out that manyof these predictions were marked by extreme triviality—as if this spirit weretied very closely to the minutiae of Socrates’s life. Socrates explained this inthe following speech to the jury who were about to condemn him to death: “I havehad a remarkable experience. In the past the prophetic voice to which I havebecome accustomed has always been my constant companion, opposing me even inquite trivial things if I was going to take the wrong course.”³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3303_0]In this final act of his life, Socrates was to find that his Divine Sign did notoppose him. It was as if his lifelong guide and mentor was resigned to theinevitable; Socrates had to die as decreed both by fate and the jury. Thehemlock goblet could not be avoided. The voice remained silent.However, the idea that all human beings have two independent elements did notremain silent. The theology proposed by Empedocles and refined by Socrates wasto find many followers in the ancient Greek world and was to become a centraltenant of the school of philosophy that was to become known as Stoicism.Epictetus, the major Stoic philosopher, was quite fascinated by this duality. Aswith Socrates and Empedocles, nothing remains of his original writings. However,his pupil Arrian wrote down his teachings, recording them in two works:Discourses and Encheiridian (or manual). In these works, it is clear that he hadtaken the evidence of Socrates’s Divine Sign and the old belief of human dualityand created a cogent philosophy. He wrote:God has placed at every man’s side a guardian, the Daemon of each man, who ischarged to watch over him; a Daemon that cannot sleep, nor be deceived. To whatgreater and more watchful guardian could have been committed to us? So, when youhave shut the doors, and made darkness in the house, remember, never to say thatyou are alone; for you are not alone. But God is there, and your Daemon isthere.⁴ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3305_0]Here we see the ongoing idea that this other entity, the daemon, is more thansimply another facet of human nature. It is an independent being that watchesover its lower self. That it has an ongoing consciousness is stated by thephrase that it cannot sleep. Indeed, the implication is that the daemonperceives even when the eidolon sleeps.This belief, however, was not unique to Epictetus or even the Stoics. Accordingto the noted historian of the late classical and early Christian period, RobinLane Fox, the Romans had an ancient but popular belief that each person had hisor her own attendant spirit who followed that person throughout his or her life.This being, termed the genius, was born with the individual and as such washonored, therefore, by each individual, on his or her birthday.⁵[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3307_0]For many of the early Christians, the idea of such a duality of spirit was adangerous heresy, particularly as it clearly had pagan roots. In order to dealwith this, the early Church Fathers applied simple semantics. They took the worddaemon and consistently used it to designate a disincarnate spirit that has beenspawned by the devil to tempt humanity away from the true God. Over time theletter a was dropped, and the word mutated into one we all know so well, demon.Job done.Well, not exactly. There was another group of Christians who found a good dealof theological justification for the daemon-eidolon duality. These were thelittle known, and quite intriguing, gnostics.According to the gnostics, the universe was under the influence of twoconflicting forces; light and darkness. Human beings are in turn a reflection ofthis duality. Our soul is a spark that comes from the light. It is thereforepart of the positive side. However our bodies are made up of matter. Matter ispart of the darkness. As such, there is this ongoing conflict within the humancondition. Human beings are imprisoned in this body of darkness but a part ofthem retains memories of their divine origin. The part rooted in the darknessequates to the eidolon. This being is made of matter and will cease to be whenthe body dies. However, the part that retains the memory is the daemon.The central tenant of gnosticism was that an eidolon had to reach a state ofgnosis (literally knowledge), and having done so, the eidolon could achieveunion with the daemon and thereby move away from this corrupt world of matter.To do this, the eidolon would need to spend many years being initiated into thesecrets of gnosticism.However, there are times when the daemon chooses to make itself seen or heard byits eidolon without initiation. The eidolon in these circumstances will perceivethe daemon to be some form of guardian angel or spirit guide. Indeed, Platowrites, “We should think of the most authoritative part of the soul as theGuardian Spirit given by God which lifts us to our heavenly home.”⁶[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3309_0]The gnostic sages carried this belief forward in its entirety. Valentinus taughtthat a person receives gnosis from his or her guardian angel, but that inreality that being is simply that person’s own higher self.⁷[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3311_0] This implies that the angels that communicatebetween the world of light and the world of darkness are, in fact, notindependent beings at all; they are daemons from this world. We are our ownteachers!This is all very interesting with regard to the history of religion andmysticism, but it really has no relevance to twenty-first-century psychology andneurology. Or does it?THE EVIDENCE FROM NEUROLOGYThat human consciousness may be dual rather than unitary may fly in the face ofcommon sense, but for those who study the brain, such an idea is not onlypossible but probable. A swift review of brain anatomy cannot but support such aproposition. The most immediate thing that strikes you when you observe a brainfor the first time is that it is not, in fact, a brain at all. It is two,virtually identical brains, joined together by a mass known as the corpuscallosum. Every structure in one side is mirrored in the other, with one,curious exception, the pineal gland. There are two of everything: two limbicsystems, two temporal lobes, two amygdalas—the list goes on. The singularity ofthe pineal gland was noted in ancient times, and because of its unique position,it has been thought of as the location of the soul.Neurologists have long been puzzled by this. Why should the brain be structuredin this way? Indeed, the puzzle has deepened in that it has been shown thatcertain individuals continue as normal people even when one of the hemispheresis damaged or removed. Indeed, in the past fifty years or so, surgery hasadvanced to such an extent that the corpus callosum can be cut, and in doing so,the two hemispheres cease to have a line of communication. When this is done,these patients literally have split brains. They also end up with twoindependent centers of consciousness. The implication of this is both clear andmind-blowing: we have two independent beings sharing our perceptions.It is generally the case that one side of the brain is dominant and one ispassive. The dominant hemisphere (usually, but not always, the left) isrational, objective, and unemotional. The nondominant (right) is understood tobe irrational, subjective, and emotional. However, this does not on its ownimply two foci of consciousness, just simply two aspects of the sameconsciousness. The two elements are simply seen as aspects of a unitaryconsciousness with the left hemisphere being generally in control with theoccasional eruption of emotion from the right. This is why in recent years therehave been so many self-help books suggesting techniques by which people canattune to their intuitive right brain. But the reality is far more complex—andfascinating.Usually, the two hemispheres work in tandem, with the left generating a constantstream of inner dialogue that gives us our sense of self. Meanwhile, the righthemisphere is still actively involved in all cognitive processes, working awayin the background. However, and here comes the surprise, the being known as I orme is generally completely unaware of what its silent partner is up to. Indeed,for most of the time, the I is completely unaware of its partner. Problems arisewhen the two fall out of phase. Suddenly I senses us. However, it is much moredisturbing than that. The dominant hemisphere perceives its nondominant twin asan external presence, a being that is not self but other. To the experiencer,this sensed presence is not him- or herself at all but an outside being.Michael Persinger of the Laurentian University in Sudbury, Canada, has spentmany years studying this peculiar psychological effect. He even has a term forthis perception. He calls it the visitor experience. Indeed, he has been able toreproduce the sensation under laboratory conditions. Persinger believes theexperience shows a linear progression. At its weakest, the subject just feelsthat he or she is not alone; that there is something else in the room that he orshe cannot see. However, at its strongest, the subject perceives an objectivelyexisting being of tangible reality, a being that has great emotionalsignificance to him or her. For some, this being may be an angel or even a god.As the intensity increases, the manifestation may become even more immanent inthe sensual world of the subject. Sensations such as weird buzzing sounds,tingling sensations, and, occasionally, a huge energy release from withinsubject’s body.What was significant to Persinger was that the brain of the subject, whenmeasured with an encephalograph, showed activity in the temporal lobes. As theexperience became more intense, the occipital lobes became activated. When thishappened, there was a sudden externalization of the sensation: The sensedpresence manifested itself as a visual being fully external to the subject. Acommon description is of a cowled figure with just a face and hand visiblethrough the folds.What is very interesting is that if the lower portion of the temporal lobesbecomes activated at this time, then long dormant memories may spontaneouslyenter the subject’s mind. The being will then communicate information that seemsintensely personal. This may be interpreted as telepathy or omnipotentknowledge. However, there is more. According to Persinger, past-life memoriescan be evoked in a panoramic life rerun, similar to those reported during thephenomenon known as the near-death experience.If this is the case, could it be that the other major element of the near-deathexperience—seeing a being in white—is really an external projection of theexperiencer’s nondominant consciousness? If so, it would certainly explain howthis being shows such intimate knowledge of the dying person’s past life.Could it be that this being really is an independent focus of consciousness thathas shared the life of its alter ego? Could the experiments of Persinger showthat the daemon is a very real aspect of every human being’s neurologicalmakeup?CHEATING THE FERRYMAN?In my first book, Is There Life after Death: The Extraordinary Science of WhatHappens When You Die, I present evidence that, during the last few seconds oflife, we all split into the two entities I term the daemon and the eidolon. Upuntil this moment, both entities have been united as one being and do perceivethemselves as two separate entities. The daemon, suddenly discovering its truevocation, is aware that it is responsible for the experience called thepast-life review. It begins the review, while at the same time manifestingitself as an image perceived by its eidolon as a figure. For some, this imagewill be the classic grim reaper figure, whereas to others, the daemon may beseen as a relative, religious figure, or even an animal—anything that fits theeidolon’s preconceptions of who will be there to welcome him or her into thenext life. The daemon then starts the past-life review using the memory storesof the temporal lobes. However, to be a reported near-death experience, actualdeath does not take place. The subject lives to tell the tale. Many of thesesurvivors describe how their life flashed before their eyes. This may be becausethe daemon, suddenly becoming aware that death will be avoided this time,metaphorically presses the fast-forward button and aborts the process.What happens in a real-death experience is that the daemon starts the past-lifereview without the need to fast-forward. The dying eidolon, in the last fewseconds of its life, falls out of time and relives again its whole life in aminute-by-minute three-dimensional re-creation of a life that isindistinguishable from the real thing. However, there is one major difference:this time, the daemon is not only self-aware but remembers what happened lasttime. In this way, the daemon reproduces exactly the role as described by thegnostics, the Stoics, and pagan sages: It becomes a guardian angel looking afterthe life of its lower self, exactly as described by Socrates.Can it be that most of us are living our lives in a three-dimensional illusion?Well, it would help to explain certain ongoing mysteries. Precognition suddenlydoes not defy scientific knowledge because it is simply a memory. Déjà vu can beseen for what it is—a jump in the playback mechanism or simply a flashback. Andwhat about those weird hunches, synchronicities, and intuitions that seem toregularly enter our consciousness? Could they be just messages from our ownhigher self—our daemon?"},{"pageContent":"S I X T E E NTHE INTENTION ECONOMYFROM EGO TO WE GODANIEL PINCHBECKWhile exploring shamanism and nonordinary states, I discovered the power ofintention. According to the artist Ian Lungold, who lectured brilliantly aboutthe Mayan calendar before his untimely death a few years ago, the Maya believethat your intention is as essential to your ability to navigate reality as yourposition in time and space. If you don’t know your intention, or if you areoperating with the wrong intentions, you are always lost and can only get moredissolute.This idea becomes exquisitely clear during psychedelic journeys, when your stateof mind gets intensified and projected kaleidoscopically all around you. As ourcontemporary world becomes more and more psychedelic, we are receiving harshlessons in the power of intention, on a vast scale. Over the last decades, theinternational financial elite manipulated the markets to create obscene rewardsfor themselves at the expense of poor and middle-class people across the world.Using devious derivatives, cunning CDOs (collaterized debt obligations), andother trickery, they siphoned off ever-larger portions of the surplus valuecreated by the producers of real goods and services, contriving a debt-basedeconomy that had to fall apart. Their own greed—such a meager, dull intent—hasnow blown up in their faces, annihilating, in slow motion, the corrupt systembuilt to serve them.Opportunities such as this one don’t come along very often and should be seizedonce they appear. When the edifice of mainstream society suddenly collapses, asis happening now, it is a fantastic time for artists, visionaries, madscientists, and seers to step forward and present a well-defined alternative.What is required, in my opinion, is not some moderate proposal or incrementalchange, but a complete shift in values and goals, making a polar reversal of oursociety’s basic paradigm. If our consumer-based, materialism-driven model ofsociety is dissolving, what can we offer in its place? Why not begin with themost elevated intentions? Why not offer the most imaginatively fabulous systemicredesign?The fall of capitalism and the crisis of the biosphere could induce mass despairand misery, or they could impel the creative adaptation and conscious evolutionof the human species. We could attain a new level of wisdom and build acompassionate global society, in which resources are shared equitably while wedevote ourselves to protecting threatened species and repairing damagedecosystems. Considering the lightning-like speed of global communication and newsocial technologies, this change could happen with extraordinary speed.To a very great extent, the possibilities that we choose to realize in thefuture will be a result of our individual and collective intention. Forinstance, if we maintain a puritanical belief that work is somehow good in andof itself, then we will keep striving to create a society of full employment,even if those jobs become “green collar.” A more radical viewpoint perceivesmost labor as something that could become essentially voluntary in the future.The proper use of technology could allow us to transition to a postscarcityleisure society, where the global populace spends its time growing food,building community, making art, making love, learning new skills, and deepeningself-development through spiritual disciplines such as yoga, tantra, shamanism,and meditation.One common perspective is that the West and Islam are engaged in an intractableconflict of civilizations, where the hatred and terrorism can only get worse.Another viewpoint could envision the Judeo-Christian culture of the West findingcommon ground and reconciling with the esoteric core, the metaphysical purity,of the Islamic faith. It seems—to me anyway—that we could find solutions to allof the seemingly intractable problems of our time once we are ready to apply adifferent mind-set to them. As Einstein and others have noted, we don’t solveproblems through the type of thinking that created them, rather they dissolvewhen we reach a different level of consciousness.We have become so mired in our all-too-human world that we have lost touch withthe other, elder forms of sentience all around us. Along with delegates to theUN, perhaps we could train cadres of diplomats to negotiate with the vegetal,fungal, and microbial entities that sustain life on Earth. The mycologist PaulStamets proposes we create a symbiosis with mushrooms to detoxify ecosystems andimprove human health. The herbalist Morgan Brent believes psychoactive floralike ayahuasca and peyote are “teacher plants,” sentient emissaries fromsuperintelligent nature, trying to help the human species find its niche in thegreater community of life. When we pull back to study the hapless and shamefulactivity of our species across Earth, these ideas do not seem very farfetched.In fact, the breakdown of our financial system has not altered the amount oftangible resources available on our planet. Rather than trying to rejigger anunjust debt-based system that artificially maintains inequitiy and scarcity, wecould make a new start. We could develop a different intention for what we aresupposed to be doing together on this swiftly rotating planet and institute newsocial and economic infrastructures to support that intent.FROM EGO TO WE GOWhen I was in my twenties, literature was my ruling passion, and my heroes werewriters like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jack Kerouac, Virginia Woolf, and HenryMiller. I longed to emulate the passionate intensity of their prose and the“negative capability” that infused their characters with recognizable life. WhenI passed through the crucible of my own transformational process, I lostinterest in novels and discovered a new pantheon of intellectual heroes. Thesedays, I find the same level of electrical engagement that I used to find innovels in the works of thinkers whose central theme is the evolution andpossible extension of human consciousness. This varied group is made up ofmystics, physicists, philosophers, cosmologists, and paleontologists—the rosterincludes Rudolf Steiner, Carl Jung, Edward Edinger, Jean Gebser, Teilhard deChardin, F. David Peat, Sri Aurobindo, and Gerald Heard.For me, personally, most contemporary fiction, like most current film, has anincreasingly retrograde quality. In their efforts to make their audienceidentify with a particular drama or trauma or relationship saga, these productsseem almost nostalgic. We live in a culture that continually seeks to entertainor at least distract us with an endless spew of personal narratives, whetherparaded on low-brow talk shows or parsed in literary novels. If you step outsidethe cultural framing, you suddenly become aware of the mechanism that keeps usaddicted to the spectacle—and, above all, hooked on ego. Our entire culture isdedicated to inciting and then placating the desires and fears of the individualego—what the media critic Thomas de Zengotita calls “the flattered self.”Although they use different languages to define it, the various theorists on theevolution of the psyche all agree that the crux of our current crisis requiresthat we transcend the ego. They suggest that the stage of material progress andscientific discovery we attained in recent centuries is not the end of humandevelopment but the launching pad for another stage in our growth. However, thisnext stage differs from previous phases in one essential way: it requires amutation in consciousness that can only be self-willed and self-directed.According to this paradigm, it is as if physical evolution has done billions ofyears of work on our behalf to get us to this point. Right now, it is our choicewhether we would like to go forward or fall by the wayside like untold millionsof other species who overadapted to one set of conditions and could notre-create themselves as their environment changed.In his influential book, Pain, Sex and Time, the British polymath Gerald Hearddefined three stages in human evolution: physical, technical, and psychical.“The first is unconscious—blind; the second is conscious, unreflective, aware ofits need but not of itself, of how, not why; the third is interconscious,reflective, knowing not merely how to satisfy its needs but what they mean andthe Whole means,” wrote Heard, who believed we were on the cusp of switchingfrom the technical to the psychical level of development. As we enter thepsychic phase, we shift “from indirect to direct expansion of understanding, atthis point man’s own self-consciousness decides and can alone decide whether hewill mutate, and the mutation is instantaneous.” Originally published in 1939,Heard’s book has just been reprinted in the United States; it was James Dean’sfavorite work and inspired Huston Smith to turn to religious studies.Despite its antique provenance, Pain, Sex and Time remains “new news” for ourtime. Heard viewed the immense capacity of human beings to experience pain andsuffering and the extraordinary excess of our sexual drive compared to ouractual reproductive needs as signs of a tremendous surplus of evolutionaryenergy that can be repurposed for the extension and intensification ofconsciousness if we so choose. “Modern man’s incessant sexuality is not bestial:rather it is a psychic hemorrhage,” Heard wrote. “He bleeds himself constantlybecause he fears mental apoplexy if he can find no way of releasing his hugestore of nervous energy.” Heard foresaw the necessity of a new form ofself-discipline, a training in concentrating psychic energy to developextrasensory perception, as the proper way to channel the excess of nervoushypertension that would otherwise lead to our destruction. He thought that wewould either evolve into a “supraindividual” condition, or the uncontrolledenergies would force us back into “preindividuated” identifications, leading tonationalist wars, totalitarian fervors, and species burnout.A sign I saw at last year’s Burning Man put it succinctly: “From Ego to We Go.”As the climate changes and our environment deteriorates, we are being subjectedto tremendous evolutionary pressures that could push us beyond individuationinto a deeply collaborative mind-set and a new threshold of psychic awareness.Seventy years after Heard’s manifesto, whether or not we want to evolve as aspecies remains an open question. But the choice is in our hands.ENLIGHTENMENT REASON OR OCCULT CONSPIRACY?What holds our world together is not only the laws of physics but language,myth, and story. Our narratives create the framework in which our actions andour intentions have meaning, or at least some kind of order. It is very hard forus to live without any coherence at all. It may even be impossible, as our mindsimmediately begin to weave together some type of fable to support whatever it iswe find ourselves doing.Lately, I find myself switching back and forth between divergent models or mythsof reality and seeking to integrate them. One of them is the story of progressand reason, the inheritance of the secular and scientific Enlightenment. Theprogressive believes that a flawed society can be improved by rational policyand political pressure. The world can be made better for more people, inequitiesreduced, and health care guaranteed. Although he has been strategic in hispronouncements, Barack Obama seems the model of a progressive reformer,promoting the type of sensible policies that led to the New Deal and the GreatSociety.The other mythic structure that entices me is occult and conspiratorial.According to this story, there is a hidden agenda beneath the façade of chaoticevents. This agenda is orchestrated by ”them,” a group of elite cabals andsecret societies, an amalgam of Free Masons, Vatican priests, the descendants ofthe Nazi scientists brought to the United States after World War II, and so on.To approach this concealed dimension of world affairs, to separate accurateinsights from disinformation, is extremely difficult and perhaps impossible. Thequest involves long reading lists of small-press and self-published tomes andmany hours on YouTube, watching lectures presented by anxious men in drabconferences. From such unreliable sources, one learns that much alien technologyhas already been recovered and reverse engineered, that a new world order oftotal social control is being orchestrated, that the ark of the covenant is atorsion field generator perhaps hidden in the Pentagon, that shape-shiftingreptilians are controlling everything, and other tidbits.Personally, I don’t reject the possibility that there is an occult element inglobal affairs, a distorting factor that makes true understanding difficult toachieve. During my shamanic work, I encountered spiritual and demonic forcesappearing as visions and voices but also causing effects that seemed to crossthe barrier between the psychic and the physical. According to shamanictraditions, spirits operate across the entire field of our world. Rather than afine-tuned conspiracy of elite cabals, the true story might be far more muddled,with various factions holding pieces of a puzzle, mired in outmoded rituals andincoherent beliefs, lacking shamanic skills. Many of those involved in thesecabals may suffer from guilt and fear the consequences if their shadowy actionsare revealed to the public.Out on the esoteric edge of the cultural imagination, one finds an increasingconvergence of thought streams. The works of Steven Greer, David Wilcock, andRichard Hoagland, as well as Nassim Haramein’s DVD set Crossing the EventHorizon (available at theresonanceproject. org) all suggest that, beyond acertain threshold, technological advances may be linked not just to technicalknowledge but to our level of consciousness, requiring higher awareness as wellas purified intentions to function. As Haramein theorizes, the ark of thecovenant might have been an actual device preserved from antediluviancivilizations, capable of generating extraordinary amounts of energy—enough toopen a passage through the Red Sea but requiring an initiate on the level ofMoses to operate it without causing mayhem. Many of these thinkers offerintriguing scenarios in which alchemical or extraterrestrial possibilities couldmanifest in tangible forms.Can someone pursue Enlightenment ideals while simultaneously exploring occultconspiracies? If we avoid becoming obsessive or dismissive, it seems possible tohold contrasting myths or models of reality in our minds at the same time. Wecan study the Mayan calendar, extraterrestrials, and gnostic cosmology whilefighting for social and environmental justice, campaigning for political reform,and so on. Whether or not our corrupt system can be changed, we could learn agreat deal by joining any valiant effort made in that direction.For Enlightenment thinkers, the sun symbolized the clear light of reason theyadored. The clear light of reason may stream from the sun, but as the Frenchphilosopher Georges Bataille noted, if you turn your gaze upward to look at itssource, you blind yourself. Those who stare at the sun for too long may goinsane. The source of reason in itself produces unreason, blindness, andmadness. Reason appears to have an innate contradiction at its center. Reason,by itself, may not be enough to get us out of our planetary plight. If spiritualforces operate within our world, then meaningful social change requires, alongwith political reform, initiatory processes and shamanic practices that could,perhaps, open our minds to new myths of reality.BUILDING A SCAFFOLD FOR SOCIAL CHANGEFor the most part, the mainstream media and federal government still treat theeconomic collapse as something that can be fixed so that economic growth canresume in a few years. Some commentators are beginning to realize that ourmeltdown represents a deeper and more permanent paradigm shift. The physicalenvironment can no longer withstand the assaults of our industrial culture. Weare experiencing a termination of capitalism as we have known it, a shutdownrecently dubbed the “Great Disruption” by Thomas Friedman, in the New YorkTimes. Until recently, a leading cheerleader for neoliberal globalization,Friedman has come to the late realization “that the whole growth model wecreated over the last 50 years is simply unsustainable economically andecologically and that 2008 was when we hit the wall.” The longer that thegeneral population is allowed to remain in denial about what is happening, themore dire the probable consequences, such as widespread famine, civil unrest,and a disintegration of basic services.The truth is that we need to make a deep and rapid change in our current socialsystems and in the underlying models and ideals of our society. It is highlyunlikely that those who have been part of the power structure, whether withingovernment or the mainstream media, possess the necessary will, vision, orinspiration to make this happen. Also, when we consider their self-servingsupport for a delusional model of infinite growth on a finite planet, ignoringall evidence to the contrary, our mainstream pundits and politicos have clearlyforfeited any claim to authority and should never be trusted again.Many elements of an alternative paradigm, a participatory model in which poweris restored to local communities, have been developed over the last decades. Oneexample is the transition town model in Britain, which serves as a foundation tohelp communities move toward resilience and self-reliance. Extraordinaryinitiatives are presented annually at the Bioneers Conference, and their websitemaintains an archive of these projects, from bioremediation to complementarycurrencies that could be rapidly scaled up if the collective will is mobilized.The nonprofit organization Pro Natura has developed an alfalfa leaf extract thatcan fulfill a person’s annual nutritive needs for a negligible sum—and manyother innovators and activists are holding crucial pieces of the new puzzle weneed to assemble quickly.What blocks real efforts at social transformation is the current level of humanconsciousness. The Italian political philosopher Antonio Negri has noted thatthe most important form of production in our postindustrial culture is theproduction of subjectivity. Our media and education systems have mechanicallyimprinted a certain level of awareness onto the masses, a passive, consumerconsciousness. People have not been encouraged to think or to act forthemselves. Now, their very survival may depend upon learning these unfamiliarskills.Since I comprehended the full depth of the crisis heading our way, I have beenworking with friends and collaborators to envision and enact solutions. We sawthe need for an alternative social network and media that could integrate manyaspects of the new paradigm while providing a scaffold for a large-scale processof social transformation. Facebook and MySpace have shown the extraordinarypower of social networks to reach an enormous audience, but they have mainlyprovided a place for people to display and distract themselves in new ways. Mostpopular social networks are designed to support the flattered self, constantlycraving attention, and the main purpose of these networks is to make a profitfor large corporations.We recently launched Evolver, an independent social network built on open-sourcesoftware that is designed to support collaboration between individuals andgroups and to engage people in the process of transforming their ownconsciousness and their local communities. While we still use many of thestandard social networking tools, we have shifted the focus to members’ missionand projects. We have also created an internal rating system for members to voteon the initiatives presented by other members so that the best ideas in everyarea will rise to the top and gain more attention. We are currently facilitatinga network of local groups, across the United States and eventually globally,that meet in person every month and engage in immediate actions to change theirworld. These groups are called Evolver Spores; you can check evolver.net to seeif there is a spore in your area, or start your own.Years ago, Barbara Marx Hubbard wrote, “If the positive innovations connectexponentially before the massive breakdowns reinforce one another, the systemcan repattern itself to a higher order of consciousness and freedom without thepredicted economic, environmental, or social collapse.” We are quicklyapproaching the critical threshold where breakdown or breakthrough becomesinevitable. I don’t know if Evolver will reach mass popularity as a tool tobring about this repatterning. Of course, I hope this is the case. In the guiseof a for-profit company, we have sought to create something akin to a socialutility. At a turbulent time when nobody knows what is going to happen next, itfeels good, at least, to have launched something into the world that can helpthe process of transformation."},{"pageContent":"S E V E N T E E N2012 AND BEYONDTHE TORTUGUERO PROPHECY UNRAVELEDGEOFF STRAYBefore 2006, many anthropologists, archaeologists, and other Mayan scholarsstated that there was nothing in the Mayan inscriptions about the end of thecurrent 5,125-year era of the long count calendar. They often did this todismiss the increasing discussion about 2012. But in April 2006, epigrapher DaveStuart answered an enquiry on a specialist discussion group announcing thatthere is one known inscription from the classic era that mentions the end of thethirteenth baktun.¹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3315_0] It is on Monument 6 from alittle-known site called Tortuguero, in the state of Tabasco in Mexico. Manymaps don’t even show the site or vary in their positioning of it.Tortuguero was discovered in 1915, but in 1978 and 1980, Berthold Riese, Ph.D.,published studies on the inscriptions found there. The papers are in German.Since then, very little emerged until Sven Gronemeyer’s master thesis of2004—also in German.², [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3317_0] ³[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3319_0] An updated version was published in English in2006.⁴ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3321_0] A cement factory was built on top ofthe site in 1981, but a few ruins remain.TORTUGUERO MONUMENT 6Tortuguero’s most famous artifact is the Tortuguero box—a well-preserved, carvedwooden box inscribed with glyphs that describe, among other things, the burialof the Tortuguero ruler, Bahlam Ajaw (Lord Jaguar). Monument 6 is broken intoseven parts, four of which are in the Villahermosa Museum, not far from theTortuguero site. Another part is in the Metropolitan Museum of New York, and twoother fragments are thought to be in the hands of a private collector. Themonument was originally a T-shaped stela, and one of the wings—the left one thatstarts the narrative—is missing. It is the other wing—the final part of thenarrative—that refers to the end of the thirteenth baktun.[../Images/img0076.jpg]Figure 17.1. The right wing of Monument 6 from Tortuguero, which refers to theend of the thirteenth baktun. Drawing by Sven Gronemeyer.Gronemeyer has split the translation of the monument into six sections. Thefirst section concerns the birth and enthronement of Bahlam Ajaw. The secondsection concerns “star wars” (wars that were timed by the first appearance ofVenus as evening or morning star) and decapitation of prisoners. The thirdsection describes the war against the neighboring town Comalcalco and theconsequent “harvest of white-flower souls.” The fourth section describes unknownevents, since some of the glyphs are damaged. The fifth section describes theritual burning of a house, the setting up of images of Bahlam Ajaw, and aruler-binding ritual.This is the context of the final section that commences three glyphs before theright-hand side wing and continues through the wing. I have renderedGronemeyer’s translation of this section into English:7 days 7 Uinals 0 Tuns and 8 Katuns, previously it happened. On 8 Chuen 9 Mak,it was completed for rebirthing [or nascent becoming], the pibnaah of AhkalK’uk. It was 2 days, 9 Uinals, 3 Tuns, 8 Katuns, and 3 Baktuns before thethirteenth Baktun is completed on 4 Ahau 3 Kankin. Then it will happen—darkness,and Bolon-Yokte will descend to the [?].The monument was set up in 669 CE to commemorate a building known as a pibnaah,which was built around 160 years earlier in 510 CE. A pibnaah is oftentranslated as a steam bath or sweat lodge, and this is how Gronemeyer hastranslated it. The construction of the pibnaah is directly forward referenced tothe end of the thirteen-baktun era in 2012 with its predicted event—darknessaccompanied by the descent of the god Bolon-Yokte. But the prophecy cannot becompleted due to damage to the glyphs.The first question this prompts is: Who is Bolon-Yokte?⁵[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3323_0] The name Bolon-Yokte translates to the god ofnine strides or the god of numerous strides, since bolon means both nine andmany. Sometimes the god is referred to as B’olon Yookte’ K’u or B’olon Okte’K’uh, where K’uh means deity. He has also been called Ah Bolon Yocte of NinePaths in the postconquest books of Chilam Balam. The god has an association withthe underworld, conflict, war, dangerous transition times, social unrest,eclipses, and natural disasters like earthquakes.⁶[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3325_0] He appears at the end of baktuns; he assistedat the creation of the current world and will be present at the next creation in2012. Other translations of the name are God of Nine Steps, the Nine-Footed God,and Jaguar-Foot-Tree, because the word bolon or balan (nine) was used by theMaya as a pun for balam (jaguar). The god was seen alternatively as nineindividuals or as a collective god.THE PIBNAAH AND THE KIVAThere are at least two examples of a pibnaah or steam bath at Chichén Itzá.These sweat lodges are still used by the Maya today and are called tuj, orsometimes chitin or kun (oven). The Aztecs also used a steam bath called atemazcal; in Mexican package holidays, a spell in a temazcal is often included.They were used for ritual purification ceremonies, healing, revitalization,cleansing, and general meetings. It is known today that they are very beneficialto the health. They flush toxic metals from the system a hundred times fasterthan the kidneys; they open clogged pores, removing excess salts; they eliminateuric and lactic acid; they increase blood flow, unclog the respiratory tract,and increase negative ions.Although today’s temazcals are aboveground, they, and the pibnaahs at ChichénItzá were usually dug five feet into the ground and used a direct fire ratherthan hot rocks, similar to the method used by Native Americans in California.The design and alignment was similar to that of a Hopi kiva, or undergroundceremonial room. Though today’s kivas are often aboveground and square, theancient Anasazi (ancestors of the Hopi) examples are round and mostly belowground. According to Frank Waters’s Book of the Hopi, many Hopis regard Aztecsand Maya as renegade Hopi clans that did not finish their migrations, so we mayhave here an insight into the pibnaah.Native American sweat lodges, as well as kivas, are seen as symbolic wombs ofMother Earth, and not only do the Hopi conduct creation myth reenactmentceremonies in kivas, but some tribes design sweat lodges to reflect creationmyths. Not only are temazcals used for pregnancy and birth, but those who haveused them ritually describe feeling their spirit bodies acknowledging the fourelements and experiencing the rebirth and death of parts of the ego that nolonger serve growth.Amazingly, there is an association between kivas and the number nine—perhaps aremnant of the Bolon-Yokte connection, upon which we are seeking to throw light.Every year, there are nine major ceremonies traditionally performed in the kiva.They correspond to the nine universes of the Hopi creation myth. There is oneuniverse for the Creator, Taiowa, one for his nephew, Sótuknang, and seven forcreated life. The Hopi say there are a total of seven worlds, or eras, and thateach one is governed by a psychic center—the same as the top five chakras of theHindu system. We are in the fourth world, known as World Complete. Ourconsciousness descended from the crown chakra in the first era down as far asthe solar plexus in the current era—each era becoming more materialistic thanthe last—but at the next world era transition, it will start to reversedirection. Each transition is called an emergence and is symbolized by alabyrinth symbol—identical the Cretan labyrinth symbol. It is also known as theMother Earth symbol, or mother and child, and the process is seen as a kind ofbirth process.There are also said to be nine prophecies that will be fulfilled before the dayof purification, which precedes the emergence. These are the coming of the whiteman, covered wagons, longhorn cattle, railroad tracks, power lines and telephonelines, concrete roads, oil spills, hippies, and, finally, the blue star kachina.Only the last of these nine remains to be fulfilled. When a blue star is seen inthe sky, and the blue star kachina dancer removes his mask in the plaza, thenthe Hopi ceremonies will cease. Though some have said this was Comet Holmes, thefact is that the Hopi ceremonies were still continuing after Comet Holmes cameand went (according to an eyewitness report of a personal friend).[../Images/img0075.jpg]Figure 17.2. This mother and child symbol is identical to the Cretan labyrinthsymbol and symbolizes a spiritual rebirth from one world to the next. There isalso a square version.NINE GENERATION RITESThe first of the nine ceremonies is called Wúwuchim, which represents birth.This ceremony is a reenactment of the Hopi emergence—their ascent from the thirdworld, represented by the inside of the kiva, to the current fourth world, intowhich they emerge at the height of the ceremony, naked and wet like newbornscoming out of the womb. They then have their hair washed in nine bowls of yuccasuds. This ceremony reaches its height when the Pleiades are overhead atmidnight, at which point the newborns get the signal to emerge. From John MajorJenkins’s discoveries, we know that the Toltec method of tracking precessionalso involved watching for the Pleiades overhead at midnight. In this way, theycould calculate how close they would be to the zenith sun exactly six monthslater. According to Jenkins, this was encoded into the pyramid of Kukulcan atChichén Itzá, which encodes this 360-year-long sun-Pleiades conjunction, whichstarts with a solar eclipse conjunct the Pleiades in the zenith on May 20, 2012.The second of the nine ceremonies is called Soyál and concerns seed germination.The seeds of their sacred crop, corn (maize), plus other crops such as beans andsquash, are taken into the kiva and germinated, with the help of the kachinas ornature spirits, who are manifested in the form of dancers. This is followed byPowamu, which is a ceremony based around planting and sprouting. The first ofthe next group of three ceremonies is Niman Kachina, which concerns growth andmaturing. Then comes the Flute Ceremony, about irrigation and more planting,followed by the Snake-Antelope Ceremony, which governs fruition. The last threeare Lakón, about fertility and planting and harvesting; then Márawu, whichconcerns flirtation and food gifts; and finally, Owaqlt, which governsconception and gifts. In each group, there is one ceremony that includes anEmergence Ceremony. The ceremonies actually work on three levels: plant, human,and species. They not only help seed germination via crop fertility rituals,they also affect human fertility and involve birth rituals; but on a specieslevel, via the Emergence rituals, they perform a rerun and purification—apreparation for the Emergence or birth into the next world, the Fifth.A further insight is allowed by Dave Stuart’s second and more completetranslation⁷ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3327_0] of the final section of Monument6:7 days, 7 Uinals, 0 Tuns and 8 Katuns previously it happened, on the day 8Chuen, the 9th of Mak, the Becoming-Ripe-House was constructed [?]. It was theunderground house [or shrine] of [the god?] Ahkal K’uk’. It was two andnine-score days, three years, eight-score years and 3 x 400 years [before] theThriteenth Pik will end on Four Ajaw, the third of Uniiw, when. . . [?] . . .will happen, the descent . . . [?] . . . of B’olon Yookte’ to the [?].So here, Stuart is providing more information about the pibnaah: it is anunderground house or shrine and also a Becoming-Ripe House. At Palenque, whichis not far from Tortuguero, the three shrines known as the Temple of the Cross,the Temple of the Foliated Cross, and the Temple of the Sun are fairly intact,and in their inscriptions, they are called pibnaahs and associated withBolon-Yokte.⁸ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3329_0] Each shrine at the top of apyramid represents a cave in a mountain—an entrance to Xibalba, the Mayanunderworld—each a path to be taken by the king, Kihnich Kan B’ahlam II (son ofLord Pacal). The Temple of the Sun is the shrine to the Jaguar God (rememberJaguar is a pun for nine), and rites of passage are described, in which the kingat the age of six and again a month before his eighth birthday participated in apreadolescent rite called Okte’ (literally wood column): at the age of sixyears, two months, and eighteen days he was, according to the inscription,“Okte’d,” and on the half-katun date of 9.10.10.0.0, he “descended intoOkte’ship.” The Temple of the Cross is the shrine to the maize god and depictsthe king undergoing a rite of passage at the age of thirteen, in which he was“tied into Okte’-ship” and received Bolon Okte’. He is shown as a boy wearing anine-knotted costume. God L, the cigar-smoking lord of the underworld is alsoshown. At eighteen, there was another rite of passage, in which the kingreceived the K’awill sceptre. The Temple of the Foliated Cross shows the worldtree as a maize plant, with corncobs as human heads. The shrine is dedicated tothe God Kawil, also known as Bolon Tzacab, the God of Nine Generations, andrecords the accession to the throne of the king, at the age of forty-eight.So we have seen that the pibnaah, as well as a steam bath, was a shrineassociated with Bolon-Yokte, plus the jaguar god and K’awill, both of which alsohave associations with the number nine. We have also seen that the ritualsperformed inside were rites of passage including trips to the underworld and thesymbolism of maize. The “becoming-ripe” house was actually a shrine for personalevolutionary development, which has parallels to the kiva with its ceremonies ofplant development, human development, and species evolution at the transitionbetween eras. This may throw some light on the connection between Monument 6 andthe pibnaah at Tortuguero.According to Frank Waters in The Book of the Hopi (1963), the Hopi saw corn as“a living entity with a body similar to man’s in many respects.” Mother Earthalso had an aspect as Corn Mother. When a child was born, he or she was kept inthe dark for thirty days with the child’s Corn Mother (represented as an ear ofperfect corn whose tip ends in four kernels) beside him or her; also, variousrituals were performed involving cornmeal. In a similar way, in the Mayan myth,“The Popol Vuh,” a series of creations are described in which humans evolve. Inthe first creation, humankind starts out as mud people, then becomes wooden dollpeople, who are replaced by monkey people. At the start of the current creation,which is seen as the fourth or fifth by different commentators, Quetzal Snakeand companions grind and mold the maize and form the next race of people—themaize people—who are the ancestors of the Quiche Maya. This includes theninefold blessing of Xmucane, goddess of midwives. According to Martin Prechtel,in the still-surviving mythology of the Tz’utujil Maya, who live in villagessurrounding Lake Atitlán in Guatemala, we are in the fifth creation, which iscalled Earth Fruit World. As we go through the five stages of life, weassimilate the lessons of the five creations, and then at death, we go to thesixth creation.This relationship between humanity and maize is reflected in the sacred Tzolkincalendar. The anthropological evidence provided by Barbara Tedlock in Time andthe Highland Maya (1982) indicates that the Tzolkin’s 260 days are based on theperiod of human gestation. When a woman misses her period, there are 260 daysuntil the birth is due. But a 260-day cycle could also be seen as a gestationperiod of the maize plant. In the highlands of Guatemala, there are 260 daysbetween planting and harvesting of maize.There may be a connection with the results found by John Burke in his study ofancient sites, Seed of Knowledge, Stone of Plenty (2005), particularly Neolithicdolmens, Silbury Hill and Avebury, plus vision-quest sites and stone chambers inNorth America, and the pyramids at Tikal. Burke and his coauthor, Kaj Halberg,found that in all these cases (at Tikal, it was just at the summit of Lost WorldPyramid, and not the later Temples I and II), the sites are positioned on a“conductivity discontinuity” that amplifies Earth currents, and the structureamplifies them even more, particularly just before dawn. The result is a two-to-threefold (even more at the Lost World Pyramid) increase in seed germinationthat can result after just twenty minutes exposure. These same electromagneticfluctuations can affect human consciousness, and the sacred sites, the authorsconclude, thus had a secondary use—the alteration of consciousness.NEW DEVELOPMENTSThere have been some important developments in Mayan studies in the past threeyears that have great significance for the interpretation of Tortuguero Monument6 and the 2012 creation point. The first of these is Michael Grofe’s 2007dissertation, The Serpent Series: Precession in the Maya Dresden Codex.⁹[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3331_0] Grofe found a 15,000-year-plus intervaldepicted in the Serpent Series of the Dresden Codex that is an almost exactmultiple of the sidereal year. This is strong evidence that the Maya weremeasuring and recording the cycle we know as the precession of the equinoxes.[../Images/img0043.jpg]Figure 17.3. The Serpent Series in the Dresden Codex that show a multiple of thesidereal year, according to Grofe. The dates are read vertically between thecoils of the snakes.In the following year, 2008, Barb MacLeod announced the discovery of the3-11-pik formula.¹⁰ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3333_0] In analyzing the glyphs ona bone from Tikal, she found three intervals of 8,660 days that add to 1 degreeof precession, accompanied by a mirrored period of three times eleven baktuns,which is half a precessional period.In 2009, on Tribe 2012, one of the web’s most popular 2012 discussion groups, Istarted a thread about a forthcoming Mayan conference on 2012,¹¹[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3335_0] and in the ensuing discussion, whileresearching a response, I stumbled across Sven Gronemeyer’s 2004 thesis onTortuguero—a document that I had previously thought was only available in anelusive hardcopy version. I made the links available in one of my posts, andJohn Major Jenkins then downloaded the thesis and enlisted the help of MichaelGrofe and MacLeod in translating the Monument 6 text directly from the Mayanglyphs into English.This has led to some important new discoveries, as Jenkins has just revealed inhis The 2012 Story, which is hot off the press.¹²[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3337_0] Grofe discovered that on Bahlam Ajaw’s birthdate, the sun was in the exact same position that it will be at the end of thethirteenth baktun on December 21, 2012 (except that, in 2012, precession willhave moved the sun/galactic equator conjunction to the day of the wintersolstice). Grofe thinks Bahlam Ajaw was claiming a special relationship with theend of the current thirteenth baktun cycle and with Bolon-Yokte, the deity whois connected to that event. Jenkins has also suggested the possibility that LordPacal of Palanque did something similar, possibly inspired by Baham Ajaw, andtried to upstage him by having his coronation day on the same day in the solaryear as the last day in the next higher cycle in the long count—thetwenty-baktun cycle, or Pictun—thus becoming a kind of higher-ranking time lord.Jenkins has suggested in his excellent new book, that the king of Copan, 18Rabbit, also connected himself to a future baktun ending, as well as the katunending 9.14.0.0.0, when the sun was again in the dark rift. This is also thelast date recorded at Tortuguero before 13.0.0.0.0, when Bolon-Yokte descends.Grofe has also discovered that Tortuguero Monument 6 shows evidence that theMaya were measuring precession by recording a lunar eclipse that occurred in thedark rift, when the glare of the moon would have been negated by Earth’s shadowcast on it, allowing the Milky Way shape to be discerned. They were thus able tocalculate the date six months later, when the sun would be in the dark rift.This collaboration between Jenkins, Grofe, and MacLeod is continuing to providemore evidence that Jenkins’s galactic alignment theory is based in fact.Jenkins’s theory, as many readers will know, suggests that the Maya deliberatelytargeted the end date of their thirteen-baktun cycle on the winter solstice of2012, since they viewed it as the point when the solar god One Hunahpu will bereborn in the mouth of the caiman, or sometimes, the jaguar-toad or a snake,represented astronomically by the winter solstice sun appearing to be in thedark rift in the central bulge of the Milky Way. The convergence of the wintersolstice sun with the dark rift is governed by what we call the precession ofthe equinoxes, caused by the slow wobble of Earth’s tilt over approximately26,000 years. The Maya were measuring this movement by the sun’s winter solsticeposition, rather than the spring equinox. Jenkins found constant references tothis as a birth event, where the sun is reborn from the birth canal of the GreatMother, and we have seen that the sweat lodges and kivas were symbolic wombs ofthe Earth mother, and the kivas were used for symbolic rebirth rituals that seethe forthcoming Emergence as a birth.In 2009, Michael Grofe published an essay called “The Name of God L: B’olonYokte’ K’uh?”¹³ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3339_0] in which he pointed out thatthe right sanctuary panel from the Temple of the Cross at Palenque (one of thepibnaahs) shows an image of God L, the cigar-smoking lord of the underworld, inwhich he carries the “skeletal centipede,” and that on it are clearly shown ninefootprints. He concludes that God L and Bolon-Yokte (the God of Nine Steps)could be the same deity, and that Bolon-Yokte could be a group of deities thattogether, are the lords of the Underworld.Grofe says that God L rules the dark half of the year, but the maize godresurrects in spring and defeats God L. One Hunahpu, the solar deity that willbe reborn in 2012, is a form of the maize god, so Grofe concludes thatBolon-Yokte’s “descent” as described on Tortuguero Monument 6, may actually behis “falling to a black place,” as the maize god’s new era begins. He shows aconnection with Maximon, the contemporary equivalent of God L, who, inpostclassic Yucatan, was represented by a wooden idol that was ritually fedduring the Uayeb days, the five fearful days just before the New Year, at theend of which, he was ritually killed and dismembered. This cigarette-smoking godis nowadays killed by hanging at Easter, due to Christian influences.Following my reading of Grofe’s assertion that Bolon-Yokte could be the same asthe nine lords of the Underworld, also known as the Nine Night Lords, or theBolon Ti Ku, I was amazed to discover an essay by Sven Gronemeyer, published in2006, in which he shows that the nine night lord glyphs were actually glyphsrepresenting the nine growth stages of the maize plant.¹⁴[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3341_0] This is clearly evident in the glyph for NightLord Nine, who represents the final completion of the process, and on his head,the ripe ears of corn are easily identified. Gronemeyer shows that thedevelopment proceeds in three main phases, and each phase is split into threemore. He says that there is a Mixtec Codex—the Fejérváry-Mayer—that shows thethreefold development, and that this relates to rites of passage: the transitionfrom a youth to an adult.[../Images/img0003.jpg]Figure 17.4. The three ceremoniesThe three stages mirror the three groups of three ceremonies performed annuallyin a kiva. This seems to confirm the conclusions we reached earlier—that thepibnaah was used for rites of passage and that these rituals, like the annualdefeat of the darkness by the light (God L by the maize god), will be played outon a macroscopic scale in 2012, when the maize god, One Hunahpu, will be rebornin the dark rift. The winter solstice (December 21, 2012) is ruled by the NinthLord of the Night, who shows the completed germination process via the ears ofcorn on his head. In other words, the pibnaah at Tortuguero that was connectedwith 2012 via its commemorative monument was used for the ripening of seeds andhumans—an individual version of the mass rebirth and species ripening that willhappen at the next creation in 2012—and in preparation for which the pibnaah,like the kiva, also probably held species rites of passage.[../Images/img0073.jpg]Figure 17.5. The Night Lord Nine, showing the ripe ears of corn on the headWHO ARE THE NINE GODS?When the Spanish arrived, the Maya had forgotten the 13-baktun cycle, and wereusing a calendar that was twenty times shorter—a 13-katun cycle, that we callthe short count. Each katun consisted of 20 tuns or 360-day years, so a katunwas just under 20 years, and the 13-katun cycle consisted of 260 tuns. Thismeans a complete 13-katun cycle lasted about 256 solar years. The Spanish burnedall the codices, or bark books, they could find, as they were thought to bedevil inspired. There are only four of these codices that have survived—theDresden, Madrid, Paris, and Grolier codices. During the colonial period, varioustowns in the Yucatan possessed copies of a book named after the last greatprophet, the Chilam Balam, or jaguar priest. The books were written in theEuropean script, but in the Yucatec Mayan language, and each town’s copy hadunique variations.The Chilam Balam books contain accounts of historical events and prophecies. Theprophecies are mainly day prophecies and katun prophecies, so commentators have,over the years, presumed these prophecies to be about events that are over anddone with. Some have admitted that, due to the Mayan conception of time ascyclical, these prophecies can repeat when the cycles repeat, though withvariations. One translator, however, has found compelling evidence that some ofthe prophecies were originally prophecies concerning the end of the thirteenthbaktun.Dr. Maud Makemson, a linguist and astronomer, translated the Chilam Balam ofTizimin and found the following prophecy:[I]n the final days of misfortune, in the final days of tying up the bundle ofthe thirteen katuns on 4 Ahau, then the end of the world shall come. . . . Irecount to you the words of the true gods, when they shall come.¹⁵[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3343_0]In the 13-katun cycle, each katun was named after the final day of the katun inthe Tzolkin (260-day) calendar. The cycle started on katun 11 ahau and ended onkatun 13 ahau (see figure 17.6). Makemson realized that this statement didn’tfit with the facts, since it says the bundle of 13 katuns was tied up—meaningthe cycle ended—on 4 ahau. However, she knew that the 13-baktun cycle ended onkatun 4 ahau (the final day is a 4 ahau day). Although Makemson had developedher own correlation, which has since been discounted, this observation remainsvalid, so the prophecy was originally about the end of the 13th baktun in 2012.It seems that when the 13-baktun cycle fell out of use in the early tenthcentury, some of the prophecies were retained and reapplied to the 13-katuncycle.[../Images/img0064.jpg]Figure 17.6. The 13-katun cycles mapped onto the 13-baktun cycle. Each square isa katun; each column is a baktun. Note the 13-katun cycles (that start with an11 ahau katu) end on a 13 ahau katun, while the final katun of the 13-baktuncycle is a 4 ahau katun.Just before the prophecy mentioned above, we find this:The Nine shall arise in sorrow, alas . . . And when over the dark sea I shall belifted up in a chalice of fire, to that generation there will come the day ofwithered fruit. There will be rain. The face of the sun shall be extinguishedbecause of the great tempest. . . . Presently Baktun 13 shall come sailing, . .. Then the god will come to visit his little ones. Perhaps “After Death” will bethe subject of his discourse.¹⁶ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3345_0]Here, Makemson has rendered katun 13 as baktun 13, for the reasons justexplained. As you can see, these prophecies predict climate change, UFOappearances, crop failure, darkness, and a return of the gods—nine gods—for theend of the current era in 2012. They also support the Tortuguero prophecy, whichpredicted darkness and a return of the nine gods. However, it isn’t all badnews, since the prophecy concludes with: “Then finally the ornaments willdescend in heaps. There will be good gifts for one and all, as well as lands,from the Great Spirit, wherever they shall settle down.”As for the phrase “‘After Death’will be the subject of his discourse,” I haveexplained elsewhere that the possibility that a significant excursion of thegeomagnetic field in response to an influx of solar and interstellar plasmacould trigger the pineal magnetite to cause an internal secretion of pinealhallucinogens (at least five—three beta-carboline molecules and two methylatedtrypatamines, including DMT—are manufactured in the pineal gland). In otherwords, since Rick Strassman’s study has shown that internal DMT is produced atbirth, death, and during mystical experiences, it seems possible that oneinterpretation of this phrase is a mass near-death experience for humanity.THE NINE NIGHT LORDSAt Tikal is the nine-leveled Pyramid of the Giant Jaguar, and according to BobMakransky, Tikal was the “home of the Bolontiku” where they have their owntemple (in Complex Q), with nine altars in front of it.¹⁷[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3347_0] At Palenque, in the base of the nine-leveledPyramid of Inscriptions, is the tomb of Lord Pacal, and the walls show ninedeities that are thought to be the Bolon Ti Ku or Nine Night Lords. Thissuggests that the nine levels represent the nine levels of Xibalba. The NineNight Lords were, like God L and Bolon-Yokte, present at the last creation andare associated with the underworld—Xibalba. In the Chilam Balam books, it isstated that the Bolon Ti Ku defeated the Thirteen Heaven Gods. To understand themeaning of this, we can take a trip round the world to find a common threadthroughout ancient mythology, but first we can take a clue from the Popol Vuhmyth.The Popol Vuh says that two gods, Hun Hunahpú (an alias of the maize god andsolar deity) and Vucub Hunahpú, are summoned to the underworld to play a ballgame with the Lords of Death (there are seven of them). They are killed, and HunHunahpú’s head is hung in a tree. Later, Hun Hunahpú’s sons—Hunahpu andXbalanque—descend to Xibalba and are tested in six zones of fear: the bat house,the razor house, the dark house, the jaguar house, the fire house, and the coldhouse. They outwit the Lords of Death and become immortal, ascending to the skyas constellations. In summary, they descended to the underworld, conquered theirfears, and metamorphosed to an immortal state.In Greek myth, Dionysus descended into Hades to rescue his mother, whom heplaced in the stars. In Christianity, Jesus descended into hell and resurrectedafter three days, then ascended into heaven. In Mithraism, Mithras dies at thewinter solstice and is reborn after three days (solar standstill); he waits inheaven for the end of time, when he will return to Earth to awaken the dead andpass judgment.YGGDRASIL AND RAGNAROKIn Norse mythology, the creator, Gothar, gave birth to nine gods, and theirdiagram of the cosmos is called Yggdrasil, which is a version of the worldtree—an interpretation of reality that is common to shamanic cultures all overthe world. These trees usually comprise three realms: an overworld, anunderworld, with an everyday world in the center. Yggdrasil is a giant tree thatis surrounded by nine worlds. The lowest of these is Helheim, the domain of thedead, ruled by Hel. Midgard is the middle-earth realm of humankind, and justabove it is Asgard, the realm of the Aesir, or principal gods, led by Odin. Odinis said to have sacrificed himself by hanging upside down on the world tree fornine days and nights in order to obtain eighteen runes (two times nine) from thewell of wyrd. The other realms are Niflheim, the frosty realm of ice; Jotunheim,the land of giants; Nidavellir, the land of dwarfs; Svartalfheim, the domain ofthe dark elves; Alfheim, the land of the light elves; and Vanaheim, the world ofthe Vanir, or fertility gods. Valhalla, the paradise for heroic warriors is partof Asgard, and the nine Valkyries are goddesses who lead the brave heroes there.Norse mythology also has its end of time—Ragnarok, or the twilight of the gods.Heimdal, born of nine sister-mothers, will blow the Gjallarhorn and the worldwill be engulfed in flame; the giant wolf gods, Fenris and Loki, will breakfree, devour the sun, and kill Odin; and Thor will kill the world serpent butwill die from its poison. There will be some survivors, including nine of thegods.This Norse mythology was, of course, the basis for Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings(as Vincent Bridges has pointed out), which was set at the end of the third age.The nine ringwraiths, or Nazgûl, were nine kings who were corrupted by the ninerings of power and were immortal in the “realm of shadows.” The fourth age beganwith the passing of the one ring that binds the nine, following a battle betweengood and evil, and this was the start of the age of men. A similar battle willoccur at each junction of the ages, and we are now approaching the end of thefourth age. Another fictional manifestation of the underworld and the nine was afilm called The Ninth Gate, starring Johnny Depp, in which he has to locate allthree copies of a seventeenth-century book called The Nine Gates to the Kingdomof Shadows. The book contains nine engravings that are parts of a ritual toraise the devil, but only three engravings from each book are the genuine ones,and these are all signed by Lucifer.[../Images/img0102.jpg]Figure 17.7. Yggdrasil and the nine realmsIn Siberian shamanism, there is an overworld, middleworld, and underworld thatare all explored by the shamans. It is said that the over-world has nine coatsor levels, that they call God’s bodies.¹⁸ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3349_0]During the first days of February, the Clear Tent ritual was held, which lastedfor nine days. Ivan Gornok, one of the two last shamans of Taimir nganasans,described the experience to A. A. Popov, a Soviet ethnographer. During theritual, the shaman travels through all three worlds and, in the underworld,visits the Lake of the Nine Grandads, in which are nine hills with “horns.”These are the bellies of nine brothers who are sleeping. The shaman has totravel down one of the horns (penises), thus emerging in the next coat of thelower world, where he finds nine tents where nine women sit. One of these is the“belly tent” and when inside, they find the woman has nine daughters, who feedthe visitors. This fractal repetition is reminiscent of a Russian nested doll.In the Sierra Nevada, in Columbia, the Kogi people have survived isolated fromthe rest of the world for many generations. Their creation myth says that Aluna,the mother, created a cosmos or womb with nine levels, which are the ninedaughters. Eight of the nine worlds were infertile; Earth was the only fertileworld. Daughter Earth was fertilized by Serankua, one of nine sons. The communalsanctuary is a hut called the Kankurua, which has a nine-level roof structure,in which they can access the nine worlds and the nine states of consciousness.The shamans of the Kogi are called Mamas, and they are chosen at birth and spendtheir first nine years in total darkness, learning to travel in Aluna, which iscomparable to the astral realm of Western esoteric systems.SHAMBHALA AND THE KALACHAKRA PROPHECYIn Tibetan Buddhism, there are traditionally said to be six bardos, ortransitional states, that are experienced between death and rebirth. However,they can apply to any transitional experience in life. These six states ofconsciousness are birth, dreams, meditation, death, clear-light experience, andtransmigration. The bardo clear-light experience starts with profound peace andawareness, but can include karmically created terrifying hallucinationsincluding meetings with forty-two peaceful and fifty-eight wrathful deities.Those who are not spiritually prepared (by meditation and reading the BardoThodol or the Tibetan Book of the Dead, with its exercises) could end uptransmigrating into a less than desirable incarnation. In the Dzogchen teachingof the Nyingma school of Vajrayana Buddhism, it is said that there are ninebardos: the three extra ones are vision, movement, and instantaneousordinariness. The nine bardos are connected with the nine yanas, or paths ofBuddhism, and are symbolized by the nine-pronged dorje and drilbu, ceremonialtools representing compassion and wisdom. Remember that when Bolon-Yokte returnsat the end of the thirteenth baktun, the Chilam Balam indicated, “‘After Death’will be the subject of his discourse.”There is a mythological hidden kingdom in Tibet called Shambhala. Many havesearched in vain for this land of paradise. Edwin Bernbaum’s book, The Way toShambhala, is probably the best overall guide, and he says that there were twodynasties of kings of Shambhala. The eighth king of the first dynasty founded anew dynasty of which he was the first of twenty-five kings who would each rulefor 100 years. The Kalachakra prophecy says there would be a total of thirty-twokings between the time of Buddha’s death and the coming of the golden age, whichwill last at least 1,000 years, when there will be no more toil or conflict andthe human lifespan will expand to 1,800 years. Some lamas say that this king,Rudra Cakrin (the Hindu name is Kalki), is now ruling, since there are disputesover the date of Buddha’s death.[../Images/img0051.jpg]Figure 17.8. A map of the kingdom of Shambhala, with the eight outer regions andthe ninth inner region separated by mountain rangesShambhala is shaped like an eight-petaled lotus flower. There are eight regionssurrounding a ninth. Each of the eight regions has twelve principalities, but inthe center of the heart of the lotus is the central palace, which has ninelevels. This is also referred to as Mount Meru, the axis mundi. Shambhala issaid to be the heart chakra of the world. The heart chakra, or anahata, isusually depicted as a twelve-petaled flower, but sometimes it has eight (thereis an extra chakra in Tibetan tantra called the hrit chakra, which is just belowthe anahata and has eight petals). There are several guidebooks for findingShambhala, but Bernbaum says these have a symbolic meaning:In other words, we can read the guidebooks to Shambhala as instructions totaking an inner journey from the familiar world of the surface consciousnessthrough the wilds of the subconscious to the superconsciousness. From this pointof view, the deities, demons, mountains, rivers and deserts described by thetexts, symbolise the various contents of the unconscious that we have to faceand master—or make use of—on the way to awakening the innermost mind. Thesecontents include a number of inner obstacles or psychological blocks of twogeneral kinds. Some come from repressed parts of the surface consciousness: Theyinclude hidden fears, desires, illusions, and habits that keep us confined toour usual state of limited awareness. Others have their source in elements ofthe deeper levels of the mind that act as barriers to keep the superconsciousfrom being overrun by the impure and chaotic contents of the subconscious.¹⁹[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3351_0]According to Victoria LePage, the eight outer regions of the kingdom ofShambhala represent eight states of consciousness, accompanied by pain andconflict that lead to the ninth, the “radiant mind of enlightenment.”²⁰[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3353_0] In kundalini yoga, it is said that whenkundalini (the evolutionary serpentlike energy that is dormant in the basechakra of unawakened people) ascends the subtle channel of the spine (thesushumna) and reaches the anahata chakra, then the soul awakens. Now recall thatthe Hopis say at the next emergence, consciousness will reverse its direction,back from solar plexus to heart.Rudra Cakrin will ride out and “kill the barbarians,” ending the age of discord,and inaugurating the golden age, when Shambhala will become visible. Bernbaumsays that the killing of barbarians refers to “a decisive inner conflict thatresults in the emergence or awakening of the innermost mind.” So, the Kalachakraprophecy seems to be saying that we are on the verge of a golden age, and justbefore it emerges, people will confront their own inner demons and shadowmaterial, clearing out the closets as a necessary preparation for life in anidealized world. There is also inference that realms that were previouslyinvisible will become accessible to our senses.The Shambhala concept is rooted in the pre-Buddhist shamanic tradition of Tibet,known as Bon. The Bon equivalent of Shambala was called Olmolungring and wasalso a completely pure and spiritual land (usually depicted as a square withmany rectangular regions, but in the center are eight regions surrounding acentral square region). At the center was a nine-leveled mountain calledYungdrung Gutsek, and each level symbolized the nine stages of Bon that lead toenlightenment. Olmolungring was not a physical place and could not be reachedbefore enlightenment was achieved. However, some scholars have identified theMount Kailash area as Olmolungring: it has an obvious layered look, due to theweathering of the geological strata.HEAVEN, HELL, AND PURGATORYIn Christian tradition, there are nine choirs of angels around the throne ofGod: seraphim, cherubim, dominions, thrones, principles, potentates, virtues,archangels, and angels. Twenty-four centuries ago, Plato conceived of ninespheres around Earth that were the “ethereal spheres” of the moon, the sun,Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, then the sphere of the fixed stars,then the sphere of the zodiac. In the second century CE, Ptolemy used the samescheme, but with the sun’s sphere moved to a place between Venus and Mars. Thekabbalistic tree of life showed nine sephiroth or spheres above Earth, orMalkuth. The spheres are connected by 22 paths that are related to the 22letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the 22 trumps of the tarot deck, and the 22chapters of the Book of Revelation. The trumps refer to the trumpets ofRevelation that announce the arrival of judgment day, depicted on trump number22.In the thirteen hundreds, Dante wrote his divine comedy, describing thepilgrimage of the soul up though nine circles of hell via the seven terraces ofMount Purgatory and the nine spheres of the planets, stars, and Primum Mobile,all of which are mobilized by the angels, to paradise. There were later medievalvariations on this theme by Lull, Fludd, Cusanus, Kircher, and otherphilosophers. Each of the nine circles of hell hold those unrepentant sinnerswho are punished for their various crimes, including the seven deadly sins.[../Images/img0026.jpg]Figure 17.9. The nine spheres of Ptolemy and Plato compared with Dante’s ninespheres, sevenfold (really ninefold)[../Images/img0011.jpg]Figure 17.10. Purgatory and the nine circles of hell. This drawing by Cactaniwas not done until 1855, over five hundred years later. Hell has too manycircles.Mount Purgatory is for those who are repentant but need to be purged(cleansed)—hence purgatory. The mountain has seven levels that relate to theseven deadly sins, but there are two extra layers that exist at the base of themountain, making nine layers altogether—these are the late repentants and theexcommunicates. On the first level, which deals with pride, souls carry a heavyburden on their backs, symbolizing the burden of pride. On the second level, theeyes of the envious are sewn shut and they wear clothes that render themvirtually invisible. On the third level, anger is corrected by acrid smoke,showing how anger clouds judgment. On the fourth level, sloth or spiritualapathy is dealt with by running continually. On the fifth level, greed is dealtwith by lying facedown on the ground, immobile, so that external desire turnsinward. On the sixth level, gluttony is treated by abstention from food anddrink, and on the seventh level, lust is corrected by a wall of flame that burnsaway carnal desires. At the top of the mountain is the Garden of Eden, where thesouls return to original innocence. Then the climb through the nine heavenlyspheres starts, with each level peopled by souls with different virtues, untilDante sees God as a point of light surrounded by nine rings of angels. Dantethen goes beyond to a zone called the Empyrean, where the souls of believersform the petals of a rose. There are strange echoes here, of the Shambhala myth.NINE VAULTS OF ENOCHThe 13th degree of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry is called the Royal Arch ofEnoch.²¹, [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3355_0] ²² [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3357_0]Enoch was the great-grandfather of Noah, who is said in the Book of Genesis tohave lived to the age of 365 years. The rite records that Enoch built a columnof granite and a column of brass, engraved with knowledge of the arts andsciences, intended to survive a coming flood (the flood of Noah, Enoch’sgrandson). He dug nine vaults in a vertical sequence, one above the other, eachroofed with an arch, and the lowest was hewn from solid rock. The crown of eacharch had an aperture sealed with a square stone and iron lifting ring, and overthe top was built a roofless temple of unhewn stones, with granite pavingconcealing the top entrance stone. In the lowest vault, he placed a cube ofagate in which was embedded a triangular plate of gold, studded with preciousgems and engraved with “the ineffable name of God.” Many years later, after theflood, when Solomon built his temple, he also built nine vaults, the ninth ofwhich was under the Holy of Holies and which was linked to his palace by atunnel. Workmen building a Temple of Justice on the site of Enoch’s templediscovered the vaults and delivered the agate cube with its triangular goldenplate to Solomon, who put it into his own ninth vault below his temple. Like aMount Purgatory going downward, one has to descend to the ninth and deepestlevel to achieve the prize.In 1119, the nine original Knights Templar went to Jerusalem, set up theirheadquarters in the Al Aqsa mosque on Temple Mount, and spent nine years diggingunder the site of Solomon’s Temple. It is widely thought that they found scrollsand treasure, which ended up in their Paris Temple, before being taken toRosslyn chapel in Scotland. Rosslyn is a replica of Solomon’s Temple and isknown to have at least one secret vault and a tunnel.Several esoteric societies have a nine-level hierarchy of grades. This includesthe Rosicrucians, the Theosophists, the Ordo Templi Orientis (before AleisterCrowley added more grades), and the nine initiations of the Ismaelis and theAssassins. It also includes the nine grades of the Priory of Sion (but theNautonnier, Pierre Plantard, admitted in 1993 that the society was a hoax). Thenine-level hierarchy represents increasing levels of spiritual development.The underworld theme continues in the concept of the labyrinth. In the Cretanmyth, the labyrinth was built by Daedalus to house the Minotaur, a monster thatwas half man and half bull. Every nine years, King Minos sacrificed seven youngAthenian men and seven young Athenian women to the Minotaur. When the Greek heroTheseus volunteered as one of the seven male victims, Ariadne, the daughter ofMinos, fell in love with him and gave him a ball of thread with which he couldfind his way out of the labyrinth, provided he would marry her afterward.Theseus killed the Minotaur, rescuing Athens from its fate. Mythologycommentators tell us that the labyrinth represents the underworld, to which thehero must descend, with the help of the maiden. Replica labyrinths usually haveseven, nine, or eleven rings, representing the levels of the underworld, and thestory symbolizes the killing off of our beast within—repressed violence, anger,and sexual obsessions—before we can be ready to integrate with our higher selves(the overself). Note also that the Cretan labyrinth symbol represents therebirth or emergence into the fifth world of the Hopi.PRECESSION AND THE NINE DOORS OF LOUHIIn Hamlet’s Mill, de Santillana and Von Dechend tell how the Danish myth ofAmleth or Amlodhi concerns a mill that was turned by nine maids on an island offNorway, until the mill was stolen and the ship sank, causing a permanentwhirlpool. In another version, the mill belongs to King Frodhi, an alias ofFreyr, who is one of the Vanir who live in Vanaheim, which is one of the ninerealms of Yggdrasil. The huge mill was worked by two giant maidens and groundout gold, peace, and happiness, making a golden age, but it eventually broke andground out only salt. The Kalavala epic of Finland tells a similar story about asmith called Ilmarinen, who is tricked by Vainamionen, the minstrel, into goingto the frozen land of the North, where he has to forge the Sampo, a magictriangular mill that grinds out flour, salt, and money, in exchange for thedaughter of Louhi, the wicked queen of the frozen land. When it is finished,Louhi entombs it in a cave in the Copper Mountain, behind nine doors of granite,each sealed by nine locks. The Sampo is called the treasure. Ilmarinen does notwin the maiden, however. Eventually, the minstrel and smith go back to thefrozen North, open the nine doors by magic, and steal the Sampo; Louhi chasesthem across the sea, but the mill eventually breaks and falls into the sea.The mill tree was also the world axis, and the golden age comes and goesaccording to the shifting of it, which is the precession of the equinoxes. Nineis connected to the precession cycle, since the precessional numbers 72, 108,216, 432, and 25,920 are all divisable by 9.In the Hindu Mahabharata and Ramayana texts, the churning of the cosmic ocean(the Milky Way) represents precession, according to de Santillana and VonDechend, and is caused by a tug of war between two dynasties of gods, who areturning the pole by pulling on a snake that is wrapped around it. The snakeusually has seven or nine heads—both forms are depicted at the Angkor Wat templecomplex in Cambodia.[../Images/img0037.jpg]Figure 17.11. The churning of the milky ocean from the Mahabharata, using theseven- or nine-headed snake, encodes precessionThe stone circles and other megalithic sites found across Britain are known tohave functioned as Neolithic calendars. Many have alignments to equinoxes andsolstices, or lunar standstills. From some of these observatories, the change inthe rise and set positions of stars caused by precession would have beenobservable. At Avebury, for example, Robin Heath has shown that the line ofhills to the east provided a horizon on which precession of half a degree wouldbe clearly evident after thirty-six years observation, as rising stars movedbetween trees on the skyline. Many stone circles are named after nine maidens;in fact, all the stone circles in Cornwall are locally referred to as the ninemaidens, regardless of the number of stones or other names for the sites. Thereare also the Nine Ladies circle on Stanton Moor and Nine Stones Close, both inDerbyshire, and there are several Wells of Nine Maidens in Scotland.So the number nine is universally associated not only with the underworld, theoverworld, and altered states of consciousness, but also with precession,ancient calendars, and maidens; in fact, nine is the number of the Great Goddessaccording to mythologist Joseph Campbell.²³ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3359_0]NINE GODDESSESThe Great Goddess has a triple aspect: maid, mother, and crone. These relate tothe waxing moon, full moon, and waning moon. The threefold aspect multiplies toa ninefold aspect that relates to the nine months of gestation. One of thebest-known groups of nine goddesses is the nine muses, who were Greek goddessesthat provided inspiration in the arts and sciences and are said to have inspiredPythagoras, who conceived of the tetractys—a triangular arrangement of ninepoints around the bindu, or seed, as well as a diagram that relates to octavesand other ratios in music. The muses were associated with the oracle at Delphi.In Arthurian legend, Arthur was taken to the Isle of Avalon (the otherworld) tohave his wound healed by nine sisters, one of whom was Morgan le Fay. A Romanhistorian records a similar island called Sein (breast) off Brittany, that wasoccupied by nine priestesses, who were healers, could predict the future,control winds and waves, and change into animal shapes. Another island calledAnnwn (the underworld) is described in a Welsh epic on which is Cerridwen’scauldron, tended by nine virgins who “boiled the cauldron with their breath.”The cauldron had a ring of pearls round its rim; it produced an elixir thatconferred inspiration, and oracular speech came out of it. King Arthur enteredthe underworld (Annwn) to steal the cauldron.The archaeologist Bligh Bond was appointed by the Church of England as directorof excavations at Glastonbury Abbey in Glastonbury, the earthly counterpart ofAvalon. Bond enlisted the help of a psychic who brought forth the spirits ofnine dead monks who called themselves the company of nine, or the nine elect.They told him where to find the grave of Arthur and the lost Edgar chapel, and agrave and chapel were duly dug up just where the nine indicated. When the churchauthorities found out, Bond lost his job at the abbey, but the episodereinforces the connection between the underworld (Avalon and the world of thedead) and the number nine.The harmonic vision of Martianus Capella, a fifth-century neo-Pythagorean,assigned the nine spheres around Earth to the nine muses, with a three-headedsnake connecting heaven to Earth, as illustrated in Kircher’s diagram (seefigure 17.12). The mythologist Joseph Campbell says the snake correlates tokundalini, the Hindu fire snake that lies dormant in the base chakra. Campbellsays Earth represents the base chakra, so Earth and the next two spheres areequivalent to the bottom three chakras; the next three muses or spheresrepresent the heart chakra and the top three muses or spheres (excluding heaven)represent the top three chakras. Kundalini’s full title is Kundalini Shakti, theEarth goddess who comes up from the ground and, when awakened, rises up thespine, energizing the chakras until she meets Shiva, her male consort, whodescends from above, and they meet in the crown chakra, annihilating the ego ina trance called samadhi. At the Navatri Festival in India, nine forms of thegoddess Shakti are worshipped for nine days. The first three days are a purge,and the first goddess encountered is Durga, who destroys our impurities anddefects. The second group of three days centers around wealth, and the lastthree on success.[../Images/img0042.jpg]Figure 17.12. Anastasius Kircher’s drawing (Ars magna lucis, Rome, 1665),connecting the nine muses to the nine heavenly spheres, relate to the chakrasconnected by kundaliniIt is now known, due to John Major Jenkins’s discoveries, revealed in his bookPyramid of Fire,²⁴ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3361_0] that the Toltecs, whoworshipped Questzalcoatl, the feathered serpent god (Kukulcan to the Maya)regarded Quetzalcoatl in a similar way to kundalini—a serpentine evolutionaryenergy that climbs up the spine. There is a prophecy from the Chilam Balam ofChumayel that says Kukulcan will return in katun 4 ahau, and the current katunis katun 4 ahau, from 1993 to 2012, so this suggests the descent of Bolon-Yoktecould be associated with a mass kundalini awakening.THE ENNEADS OF HELIOPOLISEgypt had several enneads, or pesedjets (nine-god groups), to use the originalEgyptian term, rather than the Greek. The most important was the ennead ofHeliopolis (or pesedjet of Annu or On), which consisted of Ra-Atum, the creator,who self-begat Shu and Tefnut, the air and moisture gods, respectively. Shu andTefnut were the parents of Geb and Nut, the earth and sky. Geb and Nut were(like the Maori sky and earth gods Rangi and Papa) in a close embrace andproduced children before separating. The offspring were Osiris, Isis, Set, andNephthys. All these gods are associated with the underworld, or the Duat, whichis really the region between the earthly and spiritual worlds, according toJeremy Naydler. Atum-Ra traveled each night through the Duat. Shu was thedivision between the living world and underworld, and he protected Ra on hisjourney through the Duat by using magic spells to ward off Ra’s enemy, thesnake-demon Apep. The Pyramid Texts suggest that Tefnut was the atmosphere ofthe Duat. Geb was sometimes seen as god of the underworld and protector of thedead; Nut contains the Duat as part of her body. Osiris was the god of the dead,resurrection, and judgment, and Isis as his wife, was thus queen of the Duat.Set protected Ra on his nightly journey through the Duat, and Nephthys, thehelper of the dead, also accompanied Ra and Set on the boat.In the Book of Coming Forth by Day (known as the Egyptian Book of the Dead),nine human components are described. They are the khat, or physical body; theka, or double, which is equivalent to the etheric body; the ba, or heart-soul,equivalent to the astral body and symbolized by a bird with a human head; theakh or khu, or spirit-soul, which is a divinized ba; the sahu, or spiritualbody, which carries the akh; the khaibit, or shadow; the sekhem, or vital power;the ren, or name; and the ab, or heart.Jeremy Naydler has done a great job of decoding this Egyptian soul science(psyche-ology).²⁵ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3363_0] The Osirian initiation wascenterd on achieving the experience of the ba, where consciousness isexternalized into the astral body and the physical body can be observed fromanother viewpoint. However, the next stage in the process was to neutralize thekhaibit, symbolized by a dark human silhouette, since it represents “all theuntransformed earthly appetites and obsessions that fetter the ba to thephysical realm and prevent it from moving on.” The divinization of the bacreates the akh or khu (shining one or illuminated one), symbolized by anotherbird, the crested ibis. It is also called the imperishable one, which returns toits source beyond the Duat. In order for the akh to be released from the body, anew spiritual body had to be germinated from the physical body as a vehicle forthe akh. This spiritual body is the sahu. This sounds like the immortal man inTaoist yoga that is gestated in the abdomen and expelled through a psychicopening in the top of the head to appear as a person sitting on a lotus within agolden sphere.When Robert Monroe found himself floating outside his body in the 1950s, hethought he was going mad, until his doctor told him that the experience was notuncommon, but people just didn’t like talking about it. Monroe had beenlistening to subliminal learning tapes while he was asleep at the time he hadthe experience, so he tried to replicate it by experimenting with sound. Hediscovered that the brain could be entrained into producing theta waves whileawake using binaural beats, where the difference between frequencies heard ineach ear is the required frequency—in this case, around 4Hz. He set up theMonroe Institute, a charitable binaural research and education facility inVirginia, to explore the phenomenon.In Far Journeys, Monroe describes the results of thirty years of exploration ofthe astral realms. The first realm experienced by those leaving their bodies isthe physical world, identical to everyday life but with extra inhabitants—thesouls of the recently dead and those who are unaware that they have passed on,plus the dreaming bodies of those who are asleep and dreaming. Next is theinnermost ring; then the waiting ring; then the major ring, which is split intofour quarters—the inner, lower, upper, and outer; then the outermost ring; andbeyond that graduation. This adds up to nine astral realms. Personal developmentallows the soul to climb the rings until it makes it to graduation, after whichno more earthy incarnations are necessary.NINE STEPS TO TRANSFORMATIONIn Mercurius, Patrick Harpur says that the aim of the alchemists was to restoreman’s unity with nature and to heal the rift between heaven and Earth that hadbeen caused by the fall.²⁶ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3365_0] They tried toreinstate the golden age by reproducing the operations taught to humanity byHermes Trismegistus. He explains that in tribal societies “when people areprofoundly subject to physiological processes,” such as puberty or pregnancy,they have to be “cooked” in an oven. This symbolic cooking is a rite of passage,and “some Amerindian tribes place pubescent girls and women who have just givenbirth into ‘ovens’ hollowed out of the ground.” The Hermetic vessel, he says, is“analogous to the ritual tomb, or womb, or oven in which rites of passage takeplace,” and the physical changes inside it “are symbolically correlated with thespiritual changes of the alchemist.” The magnum opus, or great work, of thealchemists incorporates all the rites of passage, according to Harpur:Solution = the birth of Sol; Separation = his initiation at the hands ofhitherto unconscious desires and effects such as occur at puberty; Conjunction =marriage (and death in the forbidden union between Sol and hismother/sister/daughter Luna); Putrefaction = burial (a mixture of cremation andburial, perhaps cooked: rotting: cremation: burial); Congelation = rebirth (thesame configuration as solution/birth but transformed to a new spiritual status);Sublimation (Rubedo) = ? Some state for which nature supplies no equivalent. TheOpus re-enacts one’s whole life in a short (or shorter) space of time in orderto raise it up into consciousness and recreate it.²⁷[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3367_0]There are usually said to be seven stages of alchemy. Harpur gives eight;Michael Maier, a sixteenth-century Rosicrucian alchemist, described nine stagesof “involutive-evolutive transmutation of the threefold body of the human being,the threefold soul, and the threefold spirit.”At the end of the thirteen-baktun cycle, the sun will be reborn as One Hunahpuaccording to Mayan mythology. Perhaps this could be a macroscopic alchemicalinitiation for Earth: the rebirth of sol. Could this be a possible rite ofpassage for sublimation? In chemistry, sublimation is “the transition from asolid to a gas, with no intermediate liquid stage.” Here we may have a clue.In the spiritual alchemical process of Taoist yoga, there are nine impedimentsto the vital breath, which allows restoration and circulation of the generativeforce. These are called the nine unsettled breaths, and they are “caused byanger which lifts and fear which lowers the breath; by joy which slows it down;by grief which disperses it; by terror which throws it out of gear; by thinkingwhich ties it up; by toil which wastes it; by cold which collects and heat whichscatters it.” The generative force is collected in the lower tan t’ ien center(just below the navel), where it is purified. Then it is raised to the middletan t’ ien at the solar plexus, where it is transmuted into vitality. After thisit is sent to the upper tan t’ien (pineal area), where vitality is transmutedinto spirit. Each of these centers is called a cauldron, but when the upper tant’ien takes over, it is called the precious cauldron.²⁸[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3369_0]Charles Musés has described a nine-step ritual movement called the Pace of Yu,which relates to the nine components of hexagram 63 of the I Ching (three yanglines and six yin semi-lines).²⁹ [../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3371_0] Hexagram 63is, surprisingly, the climax of the series, rather than hexagram 64. It meansclimax and the equilibrium achieved afterward. It is an encoded form oftransmitting knowledge of the nine cauldrons of transformation, in which arebrewed nine ingredients for the elixir of immortality. These are called the ninenuminous jewels. The cauldrons are also called the nine cranial palaces, whichresonate to the seven (plus two hidden) stars of Ursa Major. Musés says theprocess is governed by the Great Goddess, so again, we have nine, the Goddess,and the cauldron as a key to transformation to a higher state. The processdescribes a sacred pregnancy—the germination and nurture of an embryonicimmortalized self.[../Images/img0029.jpg]Figure 17.13. Hexagram 63 of the I Ching and its nine parts that correlate tothe Pace of YuMusés says hexagram 63 means “journeying across the great stream of time anddeath into a region of harmony.” This reminds us of what the Bolon-Yokte have instore for us upon their “descent” in 2012—their discourse will be on theafter-death state. Since, like the Taoists, the Egyptians also had a soul-crafttechnology, this idea complex may be associated with the Eye of Horus, as thevarious components of it were hieroglyphs for measuring volume and time. Theyadd to 63/64, and there is one myth in which Horus gave his eye to Osiris tohelp him rule in the netherworld.[../Images/img0059.jpg]Figure 17.14. The Eye of Horus with its fracional components that give 63/64Alberto Villoldo has recently announced that he is giving a series of ninePeruvian initiations or rites called the Munay Ki.³⁰[../Text/ch24.html#anchor_3373_0] They are “nine healing gates” that allow aconquering of fear and a “clearing of psychic sludge left by past traumas” inorder to transform the energy field and communicate with luminous beings and toallow aspirants to start the process of change toward becoming Homo luminous.The rites are said to be in preparation for 2012, when the Andean priests, orPaqos, of the Qero people—direct descendants of the Incas—say that Taripay Pachawill start the Age of Meeting Ourselves Again, according to Juan Nunez delPrado, and when the three worlds hanaq pacha, kay pacha, and ukhu pacha(overworld, middleworld, and underworld) will converge. Villoldo is the onlysource on the Munay Ki, so I don’t know how genuine it is. However, it does seema very good fit for the pattern that we have revealed here.HEALING AND REVEALING THE GOD SELFThe Mayan myths tell of a descent of heroes to an underworld of six houses toconquer the lords of death and to conquer their own fears, but other Mayan mythsmention an underworld of nine levels, that relate to the Nine Lords of theNight. The latest studies by Mayan epigraphers indicate that these night lordsare the same as the God of Nine Steps (Bolon-Yokte) who is set to descend at thenext creation in 2012, and that these nine gods relate to the germination phasesof maize, human individuals, and the human species evolutionary quantum leap. Wehave seen that all across the world, the number nine is associated with theunderworld, trips into the underworld to confront what turn out to be our owndemons, and then trips upward to heaven in a pilgrimage of the soul toward anenlightened state.The various myths around the number nine seem to boil down to three main themes:Healing the wounded king: A descent to the underworld of nine levels; aconfrontation with inner violence, rage, and fear; at the deepest level, adivine connection is regained, leading to healing and rejuvenation.Ascent to the ninth heaven: Consciousness rises through nine spheres; Shiva andShakti unite; the Goddess returns leading to a whole-mind integration of rightand left brains.Cyclic return of the gods: A golden age will return, governed by precession;circa 2012, our inner cauldrons will be activated along with the germinationprocess of a subtle body that can survive in a postmortem state.In other words, to put it in a nutshell, in 2012, or thereabouts, according tothe evidence presented here, something will trigger a confrontation with ourshadow selves at a time of social and environmental upheaval; the kundalinievolutionary energy will be awakened; there will be an integration ofsubpersonalities as we enter an enlightened state, accompanied by expandedperceptions, the generation of a plasma body, and contact beyond the physicalspectrum. Then the golden age will begin."},{"pageContent":"FOOTNOTES*1 [../Text/ch8.html#anchor_624_60] Relative to the Vedic view of the yugas, Iwould agree with the views of Yukteswar, who places us in the early stages of anascending Dwapara (bronze) age of 2,400 years, which has given humanityknowledge of and control over subtle forces of electricity and nuclear energy.According to this view, we will not get out of the darker phase of thisbeginning cycle until around 2100 CE.

One modern commentator, Christopher Dunn,who has a technical background, has worked out that the Egyptians knew aboutultrasound and used it for carving and drilling (that is how he explains theamazing accuracy of Egyptian stonework and the fine carving on very hard stoneslike basalt and granite—exquisite examples of vessels can be seen in the BritishMuseum). See Christopher Dunn, The Giza Power Plant: Technologies of AncientEgypt (Rochester, Vt.: Bear & Co., 1998).*3 [../Text/ch17.html#anchor_2087_28] As I wrote in my book Eye of the Phoenix,the reed is a universal symbol of civilization, high culture, education,writing, and even celestial significance. For instance, the Hopi refer to theMilky Way by the term songwuka, literally “big reed.” They have a legend ofcoming up through a great reed from the previous Third World to the presentFourth Wold. This perhaps suggests an interstellar journey along the galacticaxis.*4 [../Text/ch17.html#anchor_2125_92] The trance dance is a curing ritualwhereby spirits are contacted. Resembling the Native American Ghost Dance of thelate-nineteenth century, it is performed by dancing in a ring, usinghyperventilation in order to create a state of transcendent exhaustion. “The!Kung [San] medicine man gradually works himself up into a state of tremblingand sweating. When he approaches trance, he feels a rising sensation which heascribes to the ‘boiling’ of his medicine (n/om); as he enters deep trance, hefalls to the ground, sometimes executing a somersault.”*5 [../Text/ch17.html#anchor_2131_56] The San used to call out to the mythicalWater Snake: “Your breast gurgles because it is full of water.
