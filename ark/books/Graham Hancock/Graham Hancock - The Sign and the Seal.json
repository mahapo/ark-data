Our marriage did not survive this book. I hope thatour friendship will. Thanks, too, to my children: Sean and Leila, Luke andGabrielle. You’ve paid a heavy price for your dad’s commitment to his quest. Imean to make it up to you. I’m enormously grateful to Donald and Muriel Hancock,to James Macaulay, and to Harold Elborn, for their constant support andinterest, for their many readings of the evolving manuscript, and for the wealthof helpful suggestions and advice that they have offered. I would also like toput on record the appreciation that I feel for the invaluable contributions madeby my friends Colin Skinner, Caroline Lasko, and Claire Lasko. As well asreading the manuscript at various stages, and commenting on it, they offered meconsolation and solidarity in times of trouble and put up patiently with myoften exasperating behaviour. In Ethiopia, Professor Richard Pankhurst was botha friend and a colleague to me. I’m honoured to have worked so closely with him.And in England I benefitted greatly from the input of a series of researchassistants: Sadie Maine, Alex MacIntyre, Claire Wise, David Mestecky and JuliaHallawell. In addition, my Anglophone editors on both sides of the Atlantic, TomWeldon at Heinemann, Jim Wade at Crown, John Pearce at Doubleday Canada, as wellas my literary agents Bill Hamilton and Sara Fisher, have all shown an interestin this project and a commitment to it that has been above and beyond the callof duty.Many other people in many different walks of life have also helped along theway. Some would not want to be mentioned at all and others will, I hope, forgiveme for not setting out here a list that would be too long for the availablespace. I cannot close, however, without expressing my very special thanks andgratitude to one person in particular – Santha, who took most of the photographsin this book and who saved my life.Graham Hancock, March 1992"},{"pageContent":"PART I: ETHIOPIA, 1983LEGEND"},{"pageContent":"[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_m01_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1INITIATION: 1983It was growing dark and the air of the Ethiopian highlands was chill when themonk appeared. Stooped and leaning on a prayer stick he shuffled towards me fromthe doorway of the sanctuary chapel and listened attentively as I was introducedto him. Speaking in Tigrigna, the local language, he then sought clarificationthrough my interpreter about my character and my motives: from which country hadI come, what work did I do there, was I a Christian, what was it that I wantedfrom him?I answered each of these questions fully, squinting through the gloom as Italked, trying to make out the details of my inquisitor’s face. Milky cataractsveiled his small sunken eyes and deep lines furrowed his black skin. He wasbearded and probably toothless – for although his voice was resonant it was alsooddly slurred. All I could be sure of, however, was that he was an old man, asold as the century perhaps, that he had his wits about him, and that he did notseem to be seeking information about me out of idle curiosity. Only when he wassatisfied with everything that I had said did he condescend to shake hands withme. His grip was dry and delicate as papyrus and from the thick robes that hewore, faint but unmistakable, arose the holy odour of frankincense.Now that the formalities were over I got straight to the point. Gesturing in thedirection of the building that loomed in shadowy outline behind us, I said: ‘Ihave heard of an Ethiopian tradition that the Ark of the Covenant is kepthere … in this chapel. I have also heard that you are the guardian of the Ark.Are these things true?’‘They are true.’‘But in other countries nobody believes these stories. Few know about yourtraditions anyway, but those who do say that they are false.’‘People may believe what they wish. People may say what they wish. Neverthelesswe do possess the sacred Tabot, that is to say the Ark of the Covenant, and I amits guardian …’‘Let me be clear about this,’ I interjected. ‘Are you referring to the originalArk of the Covenant – the box made of wood and gold in which the TenCommandments were placed by the prophet Moses?’‘Yes. God Himself inscribed the ten words of the law upon two tablets of stone.Moses then placed these tablets inside the Ark of the Covenant – whichafterwards accompanied the Israelites during their wanderings in the wildernessand their conquest of the Promised Land. It brought them victory wherever theywent and made them a great people. At last, when its work was done, King Solomonplaced it in the Holy of Holies of the Temple that he had built in Jerusalem.And from there, not long afterwards, it was removed and brought to Ethiopia …’‘Tell me how this happened,’ I asked. ‘What I know of your traditions is onlythat the Queen of Sheba is supposed to have been an Ethiopian monarch. Thelegends I have read say that when she made her famous journey to Jerusalem shewas impregnated by King Solomon and bore him a son – a royal prince – who inlater years stole the Ark …’The monk sighed. ‘The name of the prince you are speaking of was Menelik – whichin our language means “the son of the wise man”. Although he was conceived inJerusalem he was born in Ethiopia where the Queen of Sheba had returned afterdiscovering that she was carrying Solomon’s child. When he had reached the ageof twenty, Menelik himself travelled from Ethiopia to Israel and arrived at hisfather’s court. There he was instantly recognized and accorded great honour.After a year had passed, however, the elders of the land became jealous of him.They complained that Solomon showed him too much favour and they insisted thathe must go back to Ethiopia. This the king accepted on the condition that thefirst-born sons of all the elders should also be sent to accompany him. Amongstthese latter was Azarius, son of Zadok the High Priest of Israel, and it wasAzarius, not Menelik, who stole the Ark of the Covenant from its place in theHoly of Holies in the Temple. Indeed the group of young men did not reveal thetheft to Menelik until they were far away from Jerusalem. When at last they toldhim what they had done he understood that they could not have succeeded in sobold a venture unless God had willed it. Therefore he agreed that the Ark shouldremain with them. And it was thus that it was brought to Ethiopia, to thissacred city … and here it has remained ever since.’‘And are you telling me that this legend is literally true?’‘It is not a legend. It is history.’‘How can you be so sure of that?’‘Because I am the guardian. I know the nature of the object that has been placedin my care.’We sat in silence for a few moments while I adjusted my mind to the calm andrational way in which the monk had told me these bizarre and impossible things.Then I asked him how and why he had been appointed to his position. He repliedthat it was a great honour that he should have been chosen, that he had beennominated with the last words of his predecessor, and that when he himself layon his death-bed his turn would come to nominate his own successor.‘What qualities will you look for in that man?’‘Love of God, purity of heart, cleanliness of mind and body.’‘Other than you,’ I asked next, ‘is anyone else allowed to see the Ark?’‘No. I alone may see it.’‘So does that mean that it is never brought out of the sanctuary chapel?’The guardian paused for a long while before answering this question. Then,finally, he told me that in the very distant past the relic had been brought outduring all the most important church festivals. More recently its use inreligious processions had been limited to just one occasion a year. Thatoccasion was the ceremony known as Timkat which took place every January.‘So if I come back next January will I have a chance of seeing the Ark?’The monk looked at me in a way that I found strangely disconcerting and thensaid: ‘You must know that there is turmoil and civil war in the land … Ourgovernment is evil, the people oppose it, and the fighting comes closer everyday. In such circumstances it is unlikely that the true Ark will be used againin the ceremonies. We cannot risk the possibility that any harm might come tosomething so precious … Besides, even in time of peace you would not be able tosee it. It is my responsibility to wrap it entirely in thick cloths before it iscarried in the processions …’‘Why do you wrap it?’‘To protect the laity from it.’I remember asking my interpreter to clarify the translation of this lastpuzzling remark: had the monk really meant ‘to protect the laity from it’? Orhad he meant ‘to protect it from the laity’?It was some time before I got my answer. ‘To protect the laity from it. The Arkis powerful.’A GREAT MYSTERY OF THE BIBLEIn early Old Testament times the Ark of the Covenant was worshipped by theIsraelites as the embodiment of God Himself, as the sign and the seal of Hispresence on earth, as the stronghold of His power, and as the instrument of Hisineffable will.1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts1] Built to containthe tablets of stone upon which the Ten Commandments had been written, it was awooden chest measuring three feet nine inches long by two feet three inches highand wide.2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts2] It was lined inside andout with pure gold and was surmounted by two winged figures of cherubim thatfaced each other across its heavy golden lid.3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts3]Biblical and other archaic sources speak of the Ark blazing with fire and light,inflicting cancerous tumours and severe burns, levelling mountains, stoppingrivers, blasting whole armies and laying waste cities. The same sources alsoleave no doubt that it was, for a very long time, the cornerstone of theevolving Jewish faith: indeed when King Solomon built the First Temple inJerusalem his sole motive was to create ‘an house of rest for the Ark of theCovenant of the Lord’.4 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts4] At someunknown date between the tenth and the sixth century BC, however, this uniquelyprecious and puissant object vanished from its place in the Holy of Holies ofthat Temple, vanished without song or lamentation in the Scriptures – almost asthough it had never existed at all. The evidence suggests that it was alreadylong gone when the armies of Nebuchadnezzar burned Jerusalem in 587 BC.Certainly it was not in the Second Temple which was built over the ruins of theFirst after the Jews had returned from their exile in Babylon in 538 BC. Neitherdoes it seem to have been taken as booty by the Babylonians.Writing in 1987, Richard Elliott Friedman, Professor of Hebrew and ComparativeReligion at the University of California, expressed a view shared by manyscholars when he described the disappearance of the sacred relic as ‘one of thegreat mysteries of the Bible’:There is no report that the Ark was carried away or destroyed or hidden. Thereis not even any comment such as ‘And then the Ark disappeared and we do not knowwhat happened to it’ or ‘And no one knows where it is to this day’. The mostimportant object in the world, in the biblical view, simply ceases to be in thestory.’5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts5]Indeed so. A close reading of the Old Testament reveals more than two hundredseparate references to the Ark of the Covenant up until the time of Solomon(970–931 BC); after the reign of that wise and splendid king it is almost nevermentioned again.6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts6] And this,surely, is the central problem, the real historical enigma: not, human naturebeing what it is, that an immensely valuable golden chest should go missing, but– given its supreme religious significance – that it should go missing amidstsuch a deafening, improbable silence. Like a black hole in space, or a negativephotographic image, it is identifiable in the later books of the Old Testamentonly by what it is not – it is, in short, conspicuous only by its absence.From this it seems reasonable to suggest that some sort of cover-up may havetaken place – a cover-up devised by priests and scribes to ensure that thewhereabouts of the sacred relic would remain forever a secret. If so then it isa secret that many have tried to penetrate – a secret that has inspired severaltreasure-hunting expeditions (all of which have failed) and also one enormouslysuccessful Hollywood fantasy, Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was first releasedin the USA and Europe in 1981 with Harrison Ford in the starring role as IndianaJones.I was living in Kenya at the time and had no opportunity to see the film untilit finally arrived in Nairobi’s cinemas early in 1983. I enjoyed the combinationof action, adventure and archaeology and I remember thinking what a sensation itwould be if someone were really to find the Ark. Then, only a few months later,I made an extended visit to Ethiopia during which I travelled to the north-westof the war-torn province of Tigray. It was there, in Axum – the so-called‘sacred city of the Ethiopians’7 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts7] –that I had my encounter with the guardian monk reported earlier in this chapter.1983: A COUNTRY AT WAROn 28 May 1991, after years of brutal fighting, the government of Ethiopia wasfinally toppled by a formidable coalition of rebel forces in which the TigrayPeople’s Liberation Front had played a leading role. When I went to Axum in1983, however, the TPLF was still a relatively small guerilla force and thesacred city, although besieged, was still in government hands. Other thanmyself, no foreigners had been there since 1974 when a team of Britisharchaeologists had been driven out by the revolution that had overthrown EmperorHaile Selassie and that had installed one of Africa’s bloodiest dictators,Lieutenant-Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, as Head of State.Lamentably the free access that I was granted to Axum did not result from anyspecial enterprise or initiative of my own but from the fact that I was workingfor Mengistu. As a result of a business deal that I was later bitterly to regretI was engaged in 1983 in the production of a coffee-table book about Ethiopia –a book that Mengistu’s government had commissioned in order to proclaim theunderlying unity in the country’s cultural diversity, and to emphasize theancient historical integrity of the political boundaries that the rebels weretrying so hard to redraw. It had been agreed before I began work that therewould be no overt promotion of the government’s cause, and it was written intomy contract that no particular individuals (Mengistu included) would be praisedor vilified. Nevertheless I was under no illusions about how the project wasviewed by senior figures in the regime: they would not have footed the bills, orpermitted me to visit historic sites forbidden to others, if they did not thinkthat what I was doing would be helpful to them.Even so it was by no means easy for me to get to Axum. Intense rebel activityalong the main roads and around the sacred city itself meant that driving wascompletely out of the question. The only option, therefore, was to fly in. Tothis end – together with my wife and researcher Carol and my photographer DuncanWilletts – I travelled first to Asmara (the regional capital of Eritrea) where Ihoped that it might be possible for us to hitch a ride over the battle lines onone of the many military aircraft stationed there.Standing on a high and fertile plateau overlooking the fearsome deserts of theEritrean coastal strip, Asmara is a most attractive place with a markedly Latincharacter – not surprising since it was first occupied by Italian forces in 1889and remained an Italian stronghold until the decolonization of Eritrea (and itsannexation by the Ethiopian state) in the 1950s.8[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts8] Everywhere we looked we sawgardens erupting with the colour of bougainvillaea, flamboyants and jacaranda,while the warm, sunny air that surrounded us had an unmistakable Mediterraneanbouquet. There was also another element that was hard to miss: the presence oflarge numbers of Soviet and Cuban combat ‘advisers’ wearing camouflage fatiguesand carrying Kalashnikov assault rifles as they swaggered up and down thefragrant pastel-shaded boulevards.The advice that these thickset men were giving to the Ethiopian army in itscampaign against Eritrean separatists did not, however, appear to us to be verygood. Asmara’s hospitals were crammed to bursting point with casualties of thewar and the government officials we met exuded an air of pessimism and tension.Our concerns were heightened a few nights later in the bar of Asmara’s rathersplendid Ambasoira Hotel where we met two Zambian pilots who were on temporarysecondment to Ethiopian Airlines. They had thought that they were going to bespending six months expanding their practical experience of commercial flying.What they were actually doing, however, was ferrying injured soldiers from thebattle fronts in Tigray and Eritrea to the hospitals in Asmara. They had triedto get the airline to release them from this hazardous duty; on checking thesmall print of their contracts, however, they had discovered that they werebound to do it.After several weeks of almost continuous sorties in aged DC3 passenger planesconverted to carry wounded troops, the two pilots were shell-shocked, shaky andembittered. They told us that they had both taken to the bottle to drown theirsorrows: ‘I can’t sleep at night unless I’m completely drunk,’ one of themconfided. ‘I keep getting these pictures passing through my mind of the thingsthat I’ve seen.’ He went on to describe the teenage boy who, that morning, hadbeen dragged aboard his aircraft with his left foot blown away by a mine, andanother young soldier who had lost half his skull after a mortar bomb hadexploded nearby. ‘The shrapnel wounds are the worst … people with huge injuriesin their backs, stomachs, faces … it’s horrible … sometimes the whole cabin isjust swilling with blood and guts … we carry as many as forty casualties at atime – way above the operating limits of a DC3, but we have to take the risk, wecan’t just leave those people to die.’They were required to fly three, sometimes four, missions each day, the otherpilot now added. In the past week he had been twice to Axum and on bothoccasions his plane had been hit by machine-gun fire. ‘It’s a very difficultairport – a gravel runway surrounded by hills. The TPLF just sit up there andtake pot-shots at us as we land and take off. They’re not fooled by theEthiopian Airlines livery. They know we’re on military business …’Overjoyed to have found some sympathetic non-Russian and non-Cuban foreigners toshare their woes with, the Zambians had not yet asked us what we were doing inEthiopia. They did so now, and seemed highly amused when we replied that we wereproducing a coffee-table book for the government. We then explained that weneeded to get to Axum ourselves.‘Why?’ they asked, dumbfounded.‘Well, because it’s one of the oldest and most important archaeological sitesand because it was there that Ethiopian Christianity first got started. It wasthe capital for hundreds of years. Our book’s going to look really sick withoutit.’‘We might be able to take you,’ one of the pilots now suggested.‘What – you mean when you next go to pick up wounded?’‘No. You definitely wouldn’t be allowed on those flights. But a delegation ofmilitary top brass are supposed to be going there the day after tomorrow toinspect the garrison. Maybe you could hitch a ride then. It would depend on whatsort of strings you’re able to pull back in Addis. Why don’t you check it out?’INTO AXUMWe spent most of the next day on the telephone to Addis Ababa talking to theminister directly responsible for our project. It was touch and go, but hisinfluence finally did get us seats on the flight that our Zambian friends hadtold us about. In the event, however, they were not to be our pilots; a fullyEthiopian crew was on board the DC3 for the short hop to Axum.During the one-hour delay before our morning take-off from Asmara airport, andduring the turbulent thirty-five-minute journey itself, I completed mybackground reading – reassuring myself in the process that the visit really wasworthwhile.The early historical references painted a picture of an important andcosmopolitan urban centre. In AD 64, for example, the anonymous author of aGreek trading manual known as the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea had referred tothe Axumite ruler as being ‘a prince superior to most and educated with aknowledge of Greek’.9 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts9] Somehundreds of years later a certain Julian, ambassador of the Roman EmperorJustinian, described Axum in glowing terms as ‘the greatest city of allEthiopia’. The king, he added, was almost naked, wearing only a garment of linenembroidered with gold from his waist to his loins and straps set with pearlsover his back and stomach. He wore golden bracelets on his arms, a golden collararound his neck, and on his head a linen turban – also embroidered with gold –from which hung four fillets on either side. When receiving the ambassador’scredentials, this monarch apparently stood on a four-wheeled chariot drawn byfour elephants; the body of the chariot was high and covered with gold plates.10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts10]In the sixth century AD, a much-travelled Christian monk, Cosmas Indicopleustes,added further colour to the impression conveyed by Julian. After his visit tothe city he reported that the ‘four-towered palace of the King of Ethiopia’ wasadorned with ‘four brazen figures’ of a unicorn, as well as the skin of arhinoceros ‘stuffed with chaff’. He also saw several giraffes which had beencaught ‘by command of the King when young and tamed to make a show for hisamusement’.11 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts11]These images of barbaric splendour well befitted the capital of what had by thattime become the most important power between the Roman Empire and Persia – apower that sent its merchant navies as far afield as Egypt, India, Ceylon andChina and that had adopted Christianity as its state religion as early as thefourth century AD.The story of the conversion of Ethiopia is preserved in the writings of thefourth-century Byzantine theologian Rufinius – an authority highly regarded bymodern historians. Apparently a certain Meropius, a Christian merchant describedby Rufinius as a ‘philosopher of Tyre’, once made a voyage to India, taking withhim two Syrian boys whom he was educating in ‘humane studies’. The elder wascalled Frumentius and the younger Aedesius. On their return journey through theRed Sea the ship was seized off the Ethiopian coast in an act of reprisalagainst the Eastern Roman Empire which had broken a treaty with the people ofthe area.Meropius was killed in the fighting. The boys, however, survived and were takento the Axumite King, Ella Amida, who promptly made Aedesius his cup-bearer andFrumentius – the more sagacious and prudent of the two – his treasurer andsecretary. The boys were held in great honour and affection by the king who,however, died shortly afterwards leaving his widow and an infant son – Ezana –as his heir. Before his death, Ella Amida had given the two Syrians theirfreedom but now the widowed queen begged them, with tears in her eyes, to staywith her until her son came of age. She asked in particular for the help ofFrumentius – for Aedesius, though loyal and honest at heart, was simple.During the years that followed, the influence of Frumentius in the Axumitekingdom grew. He sought out such foreign traders who were Christians and urgedthem ‘to establish conventicles in various places to which they might resort forprayer.’ He also provided them with ‘whatever was needed, supplying sites forbuildings and in every way promoting the growth of the seed of Christianity inthe country.’At around the time that Ezana finally ascended the throne, Aedesius returned toTyre. Frumentius for his part journeyed to Alexandria, in Egypt – then a greatcentre of Christianity – where he informed Patriarch Athanasius of the work sofar accomplished for the faith in Ethiopia. The young man begged theecclesiastical leader ‘to look for some worthy man to send as bishop over themany Christians already congregated.’ Athanasius, having carefully weighed andconsidered the words of Frumentius, declared in a council of priests: ‘Whatother man shall we find in whom the spirit of God is as in thee who canaccomplish these things?’ He therefore ‘consecrated him and bade him return inthe Grace of God whence he came.’12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts12]Frumentius accordingly went back to Axum as Ethiopia’s first Christian bishopand there he continued his missionary endeavours – which were rewarded, in theyear AD 331, by the conversion of the king himself. The surviving coins ofEzana’s reign record the transition: the earlier ones bear crescent and diskimages of the new and full moon; later examples are stamped uncompromisinglywith the cross – amongst the earliest coins of any country to carry thisChristian symbol.13 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts13]Important as the seed-bed of Ethiopian Christianity – and as the capital of theEthiopian empire from the first until approximately the tenth century AD –Axum’s interest in terms of our project was nevertheless much broader than this.Here, I read, we would come across many imposing pre-Christian ruins of greatarchaeological merit (including the remains of several immense palaces), andalso – still well preserved – the monuments for which the city was best known:its ancient obelisks, some more than two thousand years old, attesting to a highlevel of advancement in art and architecture at a date far earlier than that ofany other civilization in sub-Saharan Africa. Nor were such physical artefactsthe only witnesses to Axum’s unique stature. To my astonishment, the referenceworks I had with me reported that according to Ethiopian legends the Ark of theCovenant was kept here in a small chapel adjacent to an especially sacredchurch. The legends were connected to Ethiopia’s claim to have been the realm ofthe biblical Queen of Sheba but were generally dismissed by historians aspreposterous fictions.Having only recently seen the first Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of the LostArk, I was naturally intrigued by the possibility – however remote – that themost precious and mystical relic of Old Testament times, a relic believed tohave been lost for almost three thousand years, might actually rest in the cityI was about to visit. I therefore decided that I would not leave withoutlearning more about this strange tradition and I looked down with renewedinterest when the captain announced that Axum was directly beneath us.The DC3’s descent to the narrow runway far below was unorthodox in the extreme –and quite alarming. Instead of the usual long, low and slow approach, the pilotbrought the plane down very fast from a considerable altitude in a tightcorkscrew pattern that kept us at all times directly above the town. This, oneof the military men riding with us explained, was so as to minimize the timethat we would be a target for snipers in the surrounding hills. I rememberedwhat the Zambians had said about regularly getting hit by machine-gun fire whenlanding at Axum and prayed silently that this would not happen to us. It was anunpleasant feeling to be strapped into a flimsy seat in a narrow tube of metalhundreds of feet above the ground and to wonder whether, at any moment, bulletswere going to start plunking through the cabin floor and walls.Fortunately nothing so bad happened that morning and we touched down safely. Iremember the red gravel of the strip, the dust that flew up as the wheels madecontact, and the sight of large numbers of Ethiopian soldiers – all armed to theteeth and dressed in combat fatigues – staring at us intently as we taxied to ahalt. I noticed other things as well: trenches had been dug on both sides of therunway and there were numerous pits, covered with camouflage netting, out ofwhich protruded the barrels of heavy artillery pieces. I recall several armouredpersonnel carriers lined up near the tower and perhaps half-a-dozen Soviettanks. Parked off to one side, on the apron, there were also two Mi-24helicopter gunships with rocket pods visible beneath their stubby stabilizingfins.From the beginning to the end of our visit, Axum never for a second shed thejittery and watchful atmosphere of a city under siege. We were permitted to stayonly one night but we felt as though our time there was drawn-out, protracted,almost infinite.PALACES, CATACOMBS AND OBELISKSOur work began the moment that we arrived. Waiting to greet us as we steppeddown from the plane was an elderly Abyssinian gentleman wearing a slightlythreadbare three-piece suit and a most splendid patriarchal beard. In quaint butexcellent English, he introduced himself as Berhane Meskel Zelelew and explainedthat he had been contacted by radio from Addis Ababa and ordered to guide us andact as our interpreter. He was employed, he said, by the Ministry of Culture ‘tokeep an eye on the antiquities of Axum’. In this capacity he had helped thearchaeologists from the British Institute in Eastern Africa whose excavations ofsome of the city’s most interesting ruins had been interrupted by the revolutionof 1974.14 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts14] ‘It’s so nice to seeother British people here after such a long time,’ he exclaimed as we introducedourselves.We climbed into a vintage Land Rover with a lime-green paint job and two neatbullet holes in the front windscreen. ‘Fortunately no one was killed,’ Zelelewreassured us when we asked him about these. Laughing nervously as we drove awayfrom the airfield, I then explained what we had come to do, listed the historicsites that we wanted to visit, and told him that I was particularly intrigued byAxum’s claim to be the last resting place of the Ark of the Covenant.‘Do you believe that the Ark is here?’ I asked.‘Yes. Certainly.’‘And where is it exactly?’‘It is deposited in a chapel near the centre of the city.’‘Is this chapel very old?’‘No. Its construction was ordered by our late Emperor … in 1965 I think. Beforethat the relic had rested for many hundreds of years within the Holy of Holiesof the nearby church of Saint Mary of Zion …’ Zelelew paused, then added: ‘HaileSelassie had a special interest in this matter, by the way … He was the twohundred and twenty-fifth direct-line descendant of Menelik, son of the Queen ofSheba and King Solomon. It was Menelik who brought the Ark of the Covenant toour country …’I was all for visiting the chapel at once, but Zelelew persuaded me that therewas little point in hurrying: ‘you will not be allowed anywhere near the Ark.Where it rests is holy ground. The monks and the citizens of Axum protect it andthey would not hesitate to kill anyone who tried to break in. Just one man isallowed to enter and he is the monk responsible for guarding the Ark. We willtry to meet him later today, but first let us go and see the Queen of Sheba’spalace.’After we had assented to this attractive proposition we turned on to a bumpy,potholed road that – had we been able to follow it all the way – wouldeventually have led us hundreds of miles south-west, through the gigantic peaksand valleys of the Simien mountains, to the city of Gondar near Lake Tana. Inopen country barely a mile from the centre of Axum, however, we stopped withinsight of an extensively fortified military post which, Zelelew explained, markedthe limit of the government-controlled sector. He waved expressively at thenearby hills: ‘Everything else TPLF, so we cannot go. It’s a pity. There are somany interesting things to see … There, just around that corner in the road, arethe granite quarries where all the stelae were cut. One still remains partiallyunexcavated from the rock. And there is a beautiful carving of a lioness. It isvery ancient. It was put there before the coming of Christianity. Butunfortunately we cannot reach it.’‘How far is it exactly?’ I asked, tantalized.‘Very close, less than three kilometres. But the military will not let us pastthe checkpoint and if they did we would certainly be taken by the guerillas.Even here we should not stand around for too long. Your foreign faces will benoticed by the TPLF snipers. They might think you are Russians and decide toshoot at you …’ He laughed: ‘That would be highly undesirable, would it not?Come, follow me.’He led the way into fields to the north of the road and we quickly began tostumble across the remains of what must, once, have been an imposing building.‘This was the Queen of Sheba’s palace,’ Zelelew announced proudly. ‘According toour traditions her name was Makeda and Axum was her capital. I know thatforeigners do not accept that she was an Ethiopian at all. Nevertheless no othercountry has a stronger claim than ours.’I asked whether any archaeology had ever been done on the site to test thelegends.‘Yes, in the late 1960s the Ethiopian Institute of Archaeology conducted someexcavations here … I helped on the dig.’‘And what was discovered?’Zelelew made a mournful face. ‘The opinion was that the palace was notsufficiently old to have been the residence of the Queen of Sheba.’What the archaeologists had unearthed, and what we now spent some timeexploring, were the ruins of a great and well built edifice with finely mortaredstone walls, deep foundations and an impressive drainage system. We saw astill-intact flagstone floor – which Zelelew claimed was a large throne room –and a number of stair-wells which hinted at the existence of at least one upperstorey. There were also private bathing areas of sophisticated design and awell-preserved kitchen dominated by two brick ovens.Across the road, in a field facing the palace, we then inspected a number ofrough-hewn granite stelae, some standing more than fifteen feet high, somefallen and broken. Most were undecorated but one, the largest, was carved withfour horizontal bands, each band topped by a row of circles in relief – likeprotruding beam ends in a building made of wood and stone. This crude obelisk,Zelelew told us, was thought by the townspeople to mark the grave of the Queenof Sheba. No excavation work had been carried out beneath it, however, and thefield was now entirely given over to farmers who grew crops for the Axumgarrison. Even as we talked we saw two peasant boys approach with an ox, whichthey harnessed to a wooden plough. Oblivious to the history that lay all aroundthem, and apparently indifferent to our presence as well, they began to till thesoil.After we had finished taking pictures and notes we drove back into the centre ofthe city and then out again to the north-east to another palace complex, thisone on a hill-top with commanding views of the whole area. Square in plan, thestructure measured about two hundred feet on each side. The walls, which hadlong since crumbled, showed signs of having originally been projected at thecorners to form four towers – possibly the very towers which, in the sixthcentury, the monk Cosmas had described as being adorned with brass unicorns.Beneath the fortress Zelelew then led us down steep stone stairways into anumber of underground galleries and chambers which were roofed and walled withmassive dressed granite blocks that fitted precisely against one another withoutany mortar in the joints. Local tradition, he said, identified this cool darkwarren as the treasury used by Emperor Kaleb (AD 514–542) and also by his sonGebre-Maskal. With the aid of a flashlight we saw the empty stone coffers whichlay within – coffers believed to have once contained great riches in gold andpearls.15 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts15] Further rooms, as yetunexcavated, extended into the hillside from there, blocked off behind thickgranite walls.Eventually we left the hill-top fortress and made our way down into the centreof Axum on a gravel road. Near the bottom of the gradient, to our left, wepaused to photograph a large, open deep-water reservoir dug down into the redgranite of the hillside and approached by means of rough-hewn stairways. Knownas the Mai Shum, it seemed to us very old – an impression that Zelelew confirmedwhen he remarked that it was originally the Queen of Sheba’s pleasure bath: ‘Atleast so our people believe. Since the beginning of Christian times it has beenused for baptismal ceremonies to celebrate the Holy Epiphany, which we callTimkat. And of course the peasants still come here every day to draw theirwater.’ As though to confirm this last observation he pointed to a group ofwomen carefully descending the time-worn steps bearing gourds on their heads.By now, without any of us really noticing how the time had passed, it wasalready well past the middle of the afternoon. Zelelew urged us to hurry,pointing out that we were scheduled to fly back to Asmara at first light thenext day and that we still had much to see.Our next destination was close by, the so-called ‘Park of the Stelae’ –certainly the focal point of Axum’s archaeological interest. Here we examinedand photographed a remarkable series of giant obelisks carved from slabs ofsolid granite. The most massive of these, a tumbled fractured ruin, was believedto have fallen to the ground more than a thousand years previously. In itsheyday, though, it had stood one hundred and ten feet tall and must havedominated the entire area. I remembered from the reading I had done on theflight that its weight was estimated to exceed five hundred tons. It was thoughtto be the largest single piece of stone ever successfully quarried and erectedin the ancient world.This fallen stele was painstakingly hewn to mimic a high, slender building ofthirteen storeys – each storey complete with elaborate representations ofwindows and other details, and demarcated from the next by a row of symbolicbeam-ends. At the base could be discerned a false door complete with a knockerand lock, all perfectly carved in stone.Another fallen – but much smaller and unbroken – obelisk, Zelelew told us, hadbeen stolen during the Italian occupation of 1935–41, transported with enormousdifficulty to Rome by Mussolini, and re-erected near the Arch of Constantine.Since it, too, was elaborately carved – and therefore of great artistic value –the Ethiopian government was campaigning for its return. In the meantime,however, it was fortunate that a third decorated monolith still remained in situin the stelae park.With a flourish our guide now pointed to this towering stone needle, more thanseventy feet high and topped with a curved headpiece shaped like a half moon. Westrolled over to examine it properly and found that, like its huge neighbour, ithad been carved to resemble a conventional built-up structure – in this case anine-storey building in the fashion of a tower-house. Once again, the maindecoration on the front elevation was provided by the semblance of windows andof beams of timber supposedly inserted horizontally into the walls. Theintervals between each of the floors were defined by rows of symbolic log-ends,and the house-like appearance was further enhanced by the presence of a falsedoor.Several other stelae of varying sizes were ranged around this refined monument –all of them clearly the products of an advanced, well organized and prosperousculture. Nowhere else in sub-Saharan Africa had anything even remotely similarbeen built and, for this reason, Axum was a mystery – its antecedents unknown,the sources of its inspiration unremembered.THE SANCTUARY CHAPELAcross the road, directly opposite the park of the stelae, stood a spaciouswalled compound containing two churches – one old and the other obviously muchmore recent. These, Zelelew told us, were both dedicated to Saint Mary of Zion.The new one, which had a domed roof and a lofty bell-tower in the shape of anobelisk, had been built by Haile Selassie in the 1960s. The other dated back tothe mid-seventeenth century and was the work of Emperor Fasilidas – who, like somany Ethiopian monarchs before and since, had been crowned in Axum and hadvenerated the sacred city despite making his capital elsewhere.We found Haile Selassie’s pretentious modern ‘cathedral’ as unpleasant as it wasuninteresting. We were attracted, however, to the Fasilidas construction which,with its turrets and crenellated battlements, seemed to us ‘half church of God,half castle’ – and thus to belong to a truly ancient Ethiopian tradition inwhich the distinctions between the military and the clergy were often blurred.In the dimly lit interior I was able to study several striking murals includingone depicting the story of the life of Mary, another that of the Crucifixion andResurrection of Christ, and a third the legend of Saint Yared – the supposedinventor of Ethiopia’s eerie church music. Faded with age, this latter workshowed Yared performing before King Gebre-Maskal. The saint’s foot had beenpierced by a spear dropped from the monarch’s hand but both men were soentranced by the music of sistrum and drum that they had not noticed.Not far from the old church were the ruins of a building that must once havebeen very extensive but was now reduced to little more than its deeplyentrenched foundations. These, Zelelew explained, were the remains of theoriginal Saint Mary of Zion – which had been built in the fourth century AD atthe time of the conversion of the Axumite kingdom to Christianity. Some twelvehundred years later, in 1535, it had been razed to the ground by a fanaticalMuslim invader, Ahmed Gragn (‘the left-handed’), whose forces swept across theHorn of Africa from Harar in the east and, at one time, threatened the completeextinction of Ethiopian Christendom.Shortly before its destruction, this ‘first Saint Mary’s’ – as Zelelew called it– was visited by an itinerant Portuguese friar named Francisco Alvarez. I laterlooked up his description of it – the only one that survives:It is very large and has five naves of a good width and of a great length,vaulted above, and all the vaults are covered up, and the ceiling and sides areall painted; it also has a choir after our fashion … This noble church has avery large circuit, paved with flagstones, like gravestones, and it has a largeenclosure, and is surrounded by another large enclosure like the wall of a largetown or city.16 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts16]Zelelew rightly dated the start of construction works on the first Saint Mary’sat AD 37217 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts17] – which meant thatthis was quite possibly the earliest Christian church in sub-Saharan Africa. Agreat five-aisled basilica, it was regarded from its inauguration as the mostsacred place in all Ethiopia. This was so because it was built to house the Arkof the Covenant – which, if there was any truth to the legends, must havearrived in the country long before the birth of Jesus and must then have beenco-opted by the Christian hierarchy at some point after the new religion hadbeen officially adopted by the Axumite state.When Alvarez visited Saint Mary’s in the 1520s – becoming, in the process, thefirst European to document the Ethiopian version of the legend of the Queen ofSheba and the birth of her only son Menelik18[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts18] – the Ark was still in the Holyof Holies of the ancient church. It did not stay there for very much longer,however. In the early 1530s, with the invading armies of Ahmed Gragn drawingever closer, the sacred relic was removed ‘to some other place of safekeeping’(Zelelew did not know where). It thus escaped the destruction and looting thatthe Muslims unleashed upon Axum in 1535.A hundred years later, with peace restored throughout the empire, the Ark wasbrought back in triumph and installed in the second Saint Mary’s – built byFasilidas beside the razed remains of the first. And there apparently it stayeduntil 1965 when Haile Selassie had it moved to the new and more secure chapelput up at the same time as his own grandiose cathedral but annexed to theseventeenth-century church.It was in the grounds of Haile Selassie’s chapel that the guardian monk told mehis astonishing story about the Ark and warned me that it was ‘powerful’.‘How powerful?’ I asked. ‘What do you mean?’The guardian’s posture stiffened and he seemed suddenly to grow more alert.There was a pause. Then he chuckled and put a question to me: ‘Have you seen thestelae?’‘Yes’, I replied, ‘I have seen them.’‘How do you think they were raised up?’I confessed that I did not know.‘The Ark was used,’ whispered the monk darkly, ‘the Ark and the celestial fire.Men alone could never have done such a thing.’On my return to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, I took the opportunity toconduct some research into the historical merits of the legend that the guardianhad related to me. I wanted to find out whether there was any possibility at allthat the Queen of Sheba could have been an Ethiopian monarch. And if there was,then could she really have journeyed to Israel in the time of Solomon – aroundthree thousand years ago? Could she have been impregnated by the Jewish king?Could she have borne him a son named Menelik? Most importantly, could that sonhave made his way to Jerusalem as a young man, spent a year there at hisfather’s court, and then returned to Axum with the Ark of the Covenant?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2DISENCHANTMENTQuestions of the kind that I needed to ask in order to evaluate Axum’s claim tobe the last resting place of the Ark of the Covenant were not entirely welcomein Addis Ababa in 1983. There was still a certain amount of revolutionaryjingoism in the air less than nine years after Haile Selassie had beenoverthrown (and less than eight after he had been smothered with a pillow by theman who had engineered his downfall – Lieutenant-Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam).Mistrust, hatred and rank fear could also be detected everywhere: peopleremembered bitterly the period in the late 1970s when Mengistu’s forces hadunleashed the ‘Red Terror’ against those seeking to restore the monarchy.State-sponsored death squads had roamed the streets rooting out suspects fromtheir homes and executing them on the spot. The families of the victims of thesepurges had then had to reimburse the cost of the bullets used to kill theirrelatives before they were allowed to claim back the bodies for burial.It was in the emotional climate fostered by such atrocities that I was obligedto conduct my preliminary research into a subject that had explicit connectionswith Ethiopia’s last emperor and with the Solomonic dynasty to which he hadbelonged. Just how close these connections in fact were was made clear to mewhen a friend passed me a samizdat copy of a document prepared at the peak ofHaile Selassie’s power and popularity – the 1955 Revised Constitution.Implemented with the intent of encouraging ‘the modern Ethiopian to accustomhimself to take part in the direction of all departments of State’ and ‘to sharein the mighty task which Ethiopian Sovereigns have had to accomplish alone inthe past’, this remarkable piece of legislation nevertheless contained thefollowing unequivocal confirmation of the age-old monarchy’s Divine Right torule:The Imperial dignity shall remain perpetually attached to the line of HaileSelassie I, whose line descends without interruption from the dynasty of MenelikI, son of the Queen of Ethiopia, the Queen of Sheba, and King Solomon ofJerusalem … By virtue of His Imperial Blood, as well as by the anointing whichHe has received, the person of the Emperor is sacred, His Dignity inviolable andHis Power indisputable.1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts1]I quickly established that Zelelew, our guide in Axum, had been correct about atleast one of the things that he had told us: the Emperor had claimed to be thetwo hundred and twenty-fifth direct-line descendant of Menelik. Furthermore,very few of the Ethiopians to whom I talked in Addis Ababa – even the mostrevolutionary amongst them – seriously doubted the sacral pedigree of theSolomonic dynasty. Indeed, it was whispered that President Mengistu himself hadplucked the ring of Solomon from Haile Selassie’s dead hand and now wore it onhis own middle finger – as though, by this device, he could appropriate some ofthe charisma and supposed magical powers of his predecessor.Such whispers and rumours were interesting enough. They did not, however,satisfy my desire for hard information about the Ark of the Covenant and aboutits mystical associations with the deposed ‘line of Haile Selassie I’. Theproblem was that most of my Ethiopian contacts were too terrified to tell mewhat they knew and shut up like clams whenever I mentioned the Ark, the formeremperor, or indeed anything to do with the pre-revolutionary period that mightpossibly be interpreted as seditious. I therefore only managed to make progresswhen a knowledgeable colleague arrived in Addis Ababa from England – ProfessorRichard Pankhurst, whom I had invited to join me as co-author in the book that Iwas preparing for the government.Grandson of the famous English suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, and the son ofSylvia Pankhurst – who had fought heroically alongside the Abyssinian resistanceduring the Italian occupation in the 1930s – Richard was, and remains, theleading historian of Ethiopia. In the time of Emperor Haile Selassie he hadfounded the scholarly and well respected Institute of Ethiopian Studies at AddisAbaba University. Shortly after the revolution in 1974 he had left the countrywith his family, but was now anxious to get reinvolved; our book project,therefore, suited his own requirements well and he had taken a few days off fromhis work at the Royal Asiatic Society in London in order to discuss ourcollaboration on the text.A tall but rather stooped man in his late fifties, he had a diffident, almostapologetic manner which – as I had discovered some time previously – disguisedgreat self-confidence and a wicked sense of humour. His knowledge of Ethiopianhistory was comprehensive and one of the first matters I discussed with him wasthe Ark of the Covenant and the seemingly far-fetched claim that it might nowrest in Axum. Did he think there could be any factual basis at all to thistradition?He replied that the story of Solomon and Sheba that I had heard in the sacredcity had an ancient pedigree in Ethiopia. There were many versions of it, bothoral and written. Amongst the latter the oldest still surviving was contained ina thirteenth-century manuscript known as the Kebra Nagast – which was greatlyrevered and which most Ethiopians believed to tell ‘the truth, the whole truthand nothing but the truth’. As a historian, however, he could not accept this –particularly since the homeland of the Queen of Sheba had almost certainly beenlocated in Arabia and not in Ethiopia at all. Nevertheless he could not entirelydismiss the possibility that the legend might contain ‘some scintilla ofveracity’. There had been well documented contacts between Ethiopia andJerusalem in antiquity (though not as far back as the time of Solomon) and therecould be no doubt that Ethiopian culture did contain a strong ‘flavour’ ofJudaism. This was best illustrated by the presence in the country of a group ofindigenous Jews – known as the Falashas – who lived in the Simien mountains tothe south of Axum and around the shores of Lake Tana. There were also certainwidespread customs (many of which Abyssinian Christians shared with theirFalasha neighbours) which provided at least circumstantial evidence of earlyties with Judaic civilization. These customs included circumcision, thefollowing of food proscriptions very close to those outlined in the book ofLeviticus, and the practice (still adhered to in isolated rural communities) ofcelebrating the Sabbath on Saturdays rather than on Sundays.I was already aware of the existence of the Falashas and had requested (but notyet been granted) official permission to visit and photograph at least one oftheir villages on our next field trip – which would take us to Lake Tana andthence northwards to the city of Gondar and hopefully also to the Simienmountains. I knew next to nothing about the so-called ‘Black Jews of Ethiopia’,however, and asked Richard to tell me more about them.He replied that in physical appearance and in dress they were quiteindistinguishable from other Abyssinian highlanders. Their mother tongue, too,was indigenous, being a dialect of the Agaw language which – although nowrapidly being replaced by Amharic, the national lingua franca – had once beenspoken extensively in the northern provinces. In short, the only really uniquequality that the Falashas possessed was their religion – which was undoubtedlyJewish, though of a very archaic and idiosyncratic kind. Their adherence toancient customs, long abandoned elsewhere, had led a number of romantic andexcitable visitors to proclaim them as ‘the lost tribe of Israel’. And in thelast decade this notion had received the official blessing of the Ashkenazi andSephardi Chief Rabbis in Jerusalem who had defined the Falashas unequivocally asJews – a status that rendered them eligible for Israeli citizenship under theterms of the Law of Return.But, I asked, where had the Falashas come from in the first place? And howexactly had they been marooned in the middle of Ethiopia nearly two thousandmiles from Israel?Richard admitted that there were no easy answers to these questions. The viewaccepted by most scholars was that a number of Jews had migrated to theAbyssinian mainland from south-western Arabia in the first and second centuriesAD and had subsequently converted some sections of the local population to theirfaith; the Falashas were therefore seen as the descendants of these converts. Itwas true, he added, that an important Jewish community had established itself inthe Yemen following persecution by the Roman occupiers of Palestine in the firstcentury AD – so it was theoretically possible that missionaries and traders hadcrossed the narrow Red Sea straits of Bab-el-Mandeb and entered Ethiopia.Nevertheless he knew of no historical evidence which confirmed that this wasreally what had happened.And what did the Falashas themselves say?Richard smiled: ‘That they are descended from King Solomon of course … Theirlegend is basically the same as the Christian one but a bit more elaborate. If Iremember correctly, they claim that Solomon not only made the Queen of Shebapregnant but also her maidservant – thus fathering not only Menelik but also ahalf-brother who founded a dynasty of Falasha kings. All the rest of the Jews inEthiopia today are supposed to be the descendants of the bodyguard made up ofthe first-born sons of the elders of Israel who accompanied Menelik with the Arkof the Covenant.’‘And do you think there’s any possibility that what they say might be true – Imean that the Ark could really have been stolen from Solomon’s Temple inJerusalem and brought to Axum?’Richard made a wry face: ‘Frankly no. No possibility at all. As a matter of factAxum didn’t even exist in the period when this is supposed to have happened. Itsimply wasn’t there … Look, Solomon died – I don’t know exactly when but it musthave been around the 940s or 930s BC. If Menelik was his son then it would havehad to have been around those dates – maybe even ten or fifteen years earlier –that he brought the Ark to Axum. But there’s absolutely no way that he couldhave done that. You see, Axum wasn’t founded until at least the third centuryBC, perhaps not even until the second century BC – in other words about seven oreight hundred years after the supposed theft of the Ark.’‘Well,’ I said, ‘that rather puts paid to the whole story doesn’t it?’‘Yes – although I expect it’s just feasible that the Ark could have been broughtto some other place in Ethiopia which later got mixed up with Axum in thetraditions that have been handed down. There are, however, many other fallacies,anachronisms and inaccuracies in the legend – which is why no historian orarchaeologist worth his salt has ever been prepared to spend time investigatingit … Nevertheless not all the things that the Falashas say about themselves arecomplete fantasies and some aspects of their origins would merit furtherresearch.’‘What, for example?’‘The claim I mentioned that there was once a dynasty of Jewish kings inEthiopia … If we go back to say the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries AD we findquite a lot of evidence to support that view – and it’s probable that they had amonarchic system long before then as well. In fact, by all accounts, the Jewswere once a force to be reckoned with in this country: sometimes they evenfought successful wars with the Christian rulers in order to preserve theirindependence. But over the years they gradually weakened and began to disappear.We know that their numbers were greatly reduced between the fifteenth andeighteenth centuries. And unfortunately they’ve continued to be in steadydecline ever since. There are probably no more than twenty thousand of them leftnow – and most of them are trying to get to Israel.’Richard and I worked together in Addis for the next three days – during whichtime I benefited enormously from the detailed briefings that he gave me aboutEthiopian culture and history. Then he returned to London and Carol, Duncan andI embarked on the field trip that would take us to Lake Tana, Gondar and theSimiens.TABOTS: REPLICAS OF THE ARKDriving out of Addis Ababa in the battered Toyota Landcruiser that thegovernment had provided to facilitate our work we climbed the immenseeucalyptus-covered shoulder of Mount Entoto and then travelled in anorth-westerly direction for many miles across high, bleak moorlands.At Debra Libanos (the name means ‘Mount Lebanon’), we paused to photograph asixteenth-century church where thousands of pilgrims had congregated tocelebrate the life and miracles of Tekla Haimanot, a famous Ethiopian saint. Wesaw normally shy and conservative men and women casting off all their clothes tobathe naked in a spring of holy water. Possessed by the demanding spirit oftheir own religious fervour, they seemed enraptured, entranced, lost to theworld.Further north still we crossed the spectacular Blue Nile gorge before finallyarriving at Bahar Dar, a small town at the southern tip of Lake Tana, Ethiopia’smighty inland sea. Here we spent several days puttering about on thereed-fringed waters in a large diesel-engined launch provided to us by theMaritime Authority. We visited some of the twenty monasteries on the lake’snumerous islands and photographed their wonderful collections of old illuminatedmanuscripts, religious paintings and murals.Because of their literal ‘isolation’, we learned, these monasteries hadfrequently been used during times of trouble as places of safety for arttreasures and for sacred relics from all parts of the country. Their mainpurpose, however, was to provide their inmates with peace and solitude. One monktold me that he had not left his tiny, wooded island for twenty-five years andhad no intention of ever doing so. ‘By cutting myself off like this,’ he said,‘I get real happiness. All my days I have been loyal to God and will remain sountil I die. I have separated myself from the life of the world. I am free fromits distractions.’Every monastic community had its own church – and these buildings, usuallycircular in plan rather than rectangular, were often very old. Typically theywould have an outer walkway, open at the sides but covered by the projectingthatch of the roof, then an inner circuit (the k’ane mahlet) richly decoratedwith paintings, then a second circuit (the keddest, used for communion) which inturn surrounded a walled central enclosure (the mak’das) containing the Holy ofHolies.I had been in many Ethiopian churches before, but those on Lake Tana were thefirst in which I began to get some idea of the significance of the Holy ofHolies. I discovered that each of these inner sanctums – which only the mostsenior priests could enter – contained an object regarded as being immenselysacred. Speaking through our government interpreter at the fourteenth-centurymonastery of Kebran Gabriel, I asked what this sacred object was.‘It is the tabot,’ replied my informant, ninety-year-old Abba Haile Mariam.The word sounded familiar and, after a moment’s reflection, I remembered that Ihad heard it in Axum when I had sat in the grounds of the sanctuary chapeltalking to the guardian monk: it was the Ethiopian name for the Ark of theCovenant.‘What does he mean by tabot?’ I asked our interpreter. ‘Does he mean the Ark ofthe Covenant? We were just in Axum a couple of weeks ago and we were told thatthe Ark was there …’ I paused, genuinely puzzled, then concluded rather lamely:‘I don’t see how it can be here as well.’A lengthy discussion followed, into which several of the other monks were drawn.For a while I despaired of ever learning anything of substance from these peoplewho – quiet and withdrawn until a moment before – were now garrulous, animatedand argumentative. Eventually, however, with further probing from me and muchclarification by the interpreter, a clear picture began to emerge.Every Orthodox church in Ethiopia, it seemed, had its own Holy of Holies, and inevery Holy of Holies was a tabot. No claim was made that any of these objectswere actually the Ark of the Covenant. There was only one true Ark and that,properly known as Tabota Zion, had indeed been brought by Menelik to Ethiopia inthe time of Solomon and now stood in the sanctuary chapel in Axum. All theothers throughout the length and breadth of the land were merely replicas ofthat sacred and inviolable original.These replicas, however, were important. Indeed they were supremely important.Symbolic on several levels, it appeared from what I was told that they fullyembodied the intangible notion of sanctity. As Abba Haile Mariam painstakinglyexplained to me during our interview at Kebran Gabriel: ‘It is the tabots,rather than the churches that they stand in, that are consecrated; without atabot at its heart, in its Holy of Holies, a church is just an empty husk – adead building of no greater or lesser significance than any other.’THE BLACK JEWS OF ETHIOPIAWhen our work at the island monasteries was complete we returned to Bahar Darand then drove north, around the curving eastern shore of Lake Tana, to the cityof Gondar – founded in the seventeenth century by Fasilidas, the same emperorwho had rebuilt the church of Saint Mary of Zion at Axum. During the journey Ihad time to give further consideration to the tabot tradition that I had justlearned about.At the very least, I remember thinking, it was intriguing and odd that theEthiopian Christians should ascribe so much importance to the Ark of theCovenant that they felt the need to place replicas of it in every single one oftheir churches. The Ark, after all, was a pre-Christian relic and had absolutelynothing to do with the teachings of Jesus. So what on earth was going on here?Inevitably I began to wonder again about the validity of the Axumite claimsconcerning the Queen of Sheba, King Solomon and their son Menelik. Perhaps,after all, there was some substance to the legends. The presence of indigenousblack Jews in the country, whose origin seemed to be shrouded in mystery, wasalso intriguing – and could, it seemed to me, quite possibly be connected. Itherefore found myself looking forward with interest to visiting the Falashasettlements which I knew that we would encounter with increasing frequency onthe next stage of our field trip.Before leaving Gondar, however, we were warned by a senior official that weshould on no account try to interview or photograph any Ethiopian Jews. Underthe circumstances I was extremely frustrated by this, and even more frustrated –and annoyed – when our interpreter and official guide explained the reason forthe ban. With an absolutely straight face he told me: ‘This year the position ofour government is that the Falashas don’t exist. And if they don’t exist thenobviously you can’t talk to any of them or take their pictures … It would be acontradiction.’Less than ten minutes’ drive beyond the city limits, however, I spotted a Starof David positioned on top of a hut in a small village by the side of the road.‘Come on, Balcha,’ I said to the interpreter, ‘that’s a Falasha house isn’t it?’Balcha was an intelligent, sensitive and highly educated man who had spentseveral years in the United States. He was vastly over-qualified for thegovernment job he was now doing. He was also quite obviously impatient with themore lunatic edicts of the bureaucrats in Addis Ababa and, indeed, with officialsecrecy in general. Although we had already left the Falasha village behind Itherefore made a determined effort to persuade him to let us turn back.He cast me a discomfited glance out of the corner of his eye: ‘Really it is verydifficult. We never know from one day to the next what line our bosses are goingto take … Late last year I brought a Canadian film crew to that veryvillage … they were interested in the Jews and they had all the officialpermissions and everything. Anyway, they poked around and asked a lot of leadingquestions about religious freedom, political persecution and so on – all ofwhich I had to translate. Afterwards I was arrested by the security police andlocked up for a few weeks accused of facilitating anti-state propaganda. Do youreally want that to happen to me again?’‘No, of course not. But I’m certain there won’t be any problems. I mean we’reactually here working for the government and trying to produce a worthwhile bookabout the peoples and cultures of this country. Surely that makes a bigdifference?’‘Not necessarily. Last year, when I came with the film crew, the Falashasofficially existed – the government wasn’t denying them – but I still ended upin jail. This year there are supposed to be no Jews in Ethiopia, so I think if Itake you to one of their villages I will be in serious trouble.’I had to admit that Balcha’s logic was faultless. As we drove on throughincreasingly mountainous terrain, I asked him to explain the official position –if he could.Part of the problem, he replied, was that most of ‘the bosses’ in Addis Abababelonged to the dominant Amhara ethnic group. The Falashas lived mainly in theprovinces of Gondar and Gojjam – which were both Amhara strongholds – and, as aresult, there was tension between the two peoples. In the past there had beenoccasional massacres as well as sustained economic persecution, and the Jewswere still looked down upon and despised by their Amhara neighbours today. Sincethe revolution some efforts had been made to improve the situation, but membersof the ruling elite continued to suffer from a kind of collective guiltyconscience about the whole matter and did not want any foreigners ‘stickingtheir noses in’. Moreover, since the beginning of the 1980s, official paranoiahad been greatly heightened by the strong anti-government line taken by visitingAmerican and British Jews, who had openly and vociferously expressed concernabout Falasha welfare. ‘This has been seen as meddling in our internal affairs,’Balcha explained.As we talked I learned that there were other more complex considerations too.Instinctively lowering his voice – though our driver spoke no English – Balchapointed out that Addis Ababa was the Headquarters of the Organization of AfricanUnity and that Ethiopia had joined other African states in ending its diplomaticrelationship with Israel after the last Arab—Israeli war. The fact was, however,that clandestine links did still continue between the two countries: indeed theIsraelis were providing a certain amount of military assistance to the regime.In return for this help, some hundreds of Falashas had quietly been permitted toemigrate every year to Israel. The problem was, however, that thousands more hadfled illegally by trekking across the border into refugee camps in the Sudan –from whence, they hoped, they might eventually be airlifted to Tel Aviv.As a result of all this, the entire issue had now become very sensitive. On theone hand the government feared that its covert guns-for-people deal with theIsraelis might at any moment be exposed, thus causing maximum embarrassmentwithin the OAU. On the other hand there was real resentment at the fact thatlarge numbers of Ethiopian citizens were being lured into refugee camps in aneighbouring and not entirely friendly country. This, Balcha said, made ‘thebig-shots in Addis’ look as though they were no longer fully in control – whichwas true but not something that they wanted to publicize.During the next three days I had little time to give further consideration tothe Falasha question. Our journey had brought us into the heart of the Simienmountains – an Afro-Alpine wilderness, all of which lay at more than sixthousand feet above sea level, much at nine thousand feet or more, and a notinsignificant portion at thirteen thousand feet plus. The giant of the range,the snow-capped peak of Mount Ras Dashen, soared up to fourteen thousand ninehundred and ten feet – making it the highest point in Ethiopia and the fourthhighest in the whole continent of Africa.At an altitude of ten thousand feet, the camp that we had established as thebase for our photography and research was freezing cold at night – so cold thatwe had to keep a huge fire stoked and burning. In the mornings, however, as thedawn mists evaporated beneath the rising sun, warmth filled the air andastonishing views unfolded in all directions over a surreal landscape whichancient seismic activity, followed by millions of years of erosion, had leftfolded and fissured, cut through with steep valleys, and dominated by isolated,jutting crags.Our treks frequently took us up above twelve thousand feet on to remote,unpopulated heaths. At lower altitudes, however, we saw frequent signs of humanhabitation: grassy meadows that provided grazing for sheep, goats and cattle,and terraced hillsides divided into allotments and planted with cereals. Viewingthese tidy smallholdings, I had the sense of a very old, long-establishedpattern of agricultural life and of a peasant culture that probably hadexperienced no significant change in the past century – nor even in the pastmillennium.There were a few Falasha communities – which, at Balcha’s insistence, werigorously avoided. The majority of the population, however, were Amharas wholived not in villages but in small hamlets – usually of six houses or less –that tended to be inhabited by single extended families. Typically their homeswere circular structures with walls made of wattle-and-daub or sometimes ofstone, and with conical thatched roofs supported by wooden poles rising throughthe centre.The peasant whom we met and talked to were poor, in some cases very poor indeed,and their lives were clearly ruled by the iron rods of soil and season.Nevertheless they were also dignified and proud and this, Balcha told us, wasbecause they felt – with good reason – that they belonged to a ‘master race’.Over an astonishing period of more than seven hundred years, from AD 1270 untilthe overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, all but one of the rulers ofEthiopia had been Amharas. It was their mother-tongue, furthermore – Amharic –that had been adopted as the country’s official language.Inevitably, therefore, Amhara culture – expressed through an almost universaldedication to the Christian faith – had had an enormous impact. In the past fewcenturies, whole tribes and peoples had become ‘Amharized’, and this process wasstill continuing in many different parts of Ethiopia. In such a context, Balchaconcluded, it was little short of a miracle that subject groups like theFalashas had managed to survive at all, let alone maintain their own distinctidentity.A maverick at heart, Balcha (who some years later defected to the United States)surprised us on our journey back to Gondar by ordering our driver to stop at thesame Falasha village that we had seen on our way out. ‘Go on,’ he said, ‘I’llgive you ten minutes.’ He then folded his arms and pretended to fall asleep.From the moment we climbed down from the Landcruiser we were besieged by womenand children all shouting ‘Shalom, Shalom’ – which, it quickly transpired, wasjust about the only word of Hebrew that they knew. With Balcha steadfastlyrefusing to interpret for us, we at first had some difficulty in communicating;soon, however, we found a young man who spoke some English and, in exchange fora small sum of money, he agreed to show us around.There was not much to see. Sprawled up a slope at the side of the road, thevillage – it was called Weleka – was dirty and seething with flies. Many of thepeople who pressed around us seemed to think that we ourselves must be Jewishand that we had come to take them away to Israel. Others ran towards us witharmloads of souvenirs – for the most part baked clay representations of the Starof David and of the supposed bed-time scene between Solomon and Sheba. Theplaintive earnestness with which these items were touted touched me and I askedour guide how long it had been since there had been any foreigners here to buytheir goods. ‘Not since year before,’ he replied.In the short time we had at our disposal we photographed what we could. Here aloom stood positioned for a weaver above a hole in the ground; there pieces ofiron lay scattered around a fire, in the flickering flames of which a blacksmithwas forging an axe-head; in one hut clay was being baked; in another we found awoman at work fashioning pottery. The Amharas, Balcha told us later, despisedsuch lowly trades – indeed, in their language, the word for ‘manual worker’(tabib) had the same meaning as ‘one with the evil eye’.By the time we left Weleka I felt thoroughly jaded. Partly prompted by whatRichard Pankhurst had told me about the medieval history of the Falashas, andpartly because I was intrigued by the possible connection of this people to theArk of the Covenant story that I had heard in Axum, I had built up some ratherunrealistic and extravagant expectations. A romantic at heart, I had nurtureddreams of encountering a noble and ancient Judaic civilization. The reality,however, seemed to be a degraded and impoverished peasant culture overanxious topander to the enthusiasms of foreigners. Even the place of worship, which theFalashas called a mesgid, turned out to be filled with chintzy gifts fromIsrael: boxes of matsos were stacked in one corner and nobody could read theTorah – which had been printed in Tel Aviv – because it was written in Hebrew.Just before we drove away I bought one of the miniature sculptures of Solomonand Sheba in bed together. I have it still. At the time I remember thinking thatits cheap workmanship and sentimental imagery appropriately symbolized thedeficiencies of the legend itself. Disappointed and disenchanted I glowered outof the window of the Landcruiser as we motored back into Gondar.COUP DE GRÂCEBy the end of 1983 I had entirely lost interest in the Axumite claim to the Arkof the Covenant. The coup de grâce, however, was not delivered by the tawdryFalasha village but by what I saw when I followed up the one issue stilloutstanding after the completion of our field work – the question of the tabots,the replicas of the Ark, which were lodged in every Ethiopian Christian church.This custom had struck me as being of possible relevance and I wanted to findout more about it.I raised the matter in the late autumn of 1983 on a visit that I made to RichardPankhurst’s home in London’s elegant Hampstead district. Over tea and biscuitsthe historian confirmed that tabots were indeed supposed to be replicas of theArk and added: ‘It’s a most curious tradition. As far as I’m aware there’s noprecedent for it in any other brand of Christianity.’I asked if he knew how long tabots had been in use in Ethiopia. He replied thathe honestly had no idea. ‘The first historical mention was probably made byFather Francisco Alvarez who visited the north of the country in the sixteenthcentury. But it’s clear that he was witnessing a tradition that was already veryold at that time.’Richard then pulled down from his bookshelf a slim volume, printed in 1970,entitled The Ethiopian Orthodox Church. ‘This is an official churchpublication,’ he said, ‘let’s have a look and see if it offers any enlightenmenton the subject.’There was no index, but we checked first in a chapter entitled ‘The Consecrationof a Church’. Here I read:The consecration of a church is a solemn and impressive ceremony with ritessymbolic of the sacred uses to which the edifice is dedicated. The various partsof the service are of very ancient date … The Tabot, or Ark, previouslyconsecrated by the Patriarch, is installed with grandeur and is the chieffeature of the ceremony.2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts2]In another chapter, ‘Church Buildings’, I came across this passage: ‘It is theTabot which gives sanctity to the church in which it is placed.’3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts3] Finally, in the glossary, I foundthe word tabot defined simply as ‘Ark of the Covenant’.4[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts4]I next asked Richard if he had any idea what tabots looked like. ‘The Bible saysthat the original Ark of the Covenant was a wood and gold box about the size ofa tea-chest. Do the tabots fit that description?’‘Well, no, I’m afraid they don’t. Of course lay people aren’t supposed to seethem at all. Even when they’re brought out in procession they’re always coveredin cloth wrappings. But they’re certainly much smaller than the biblicaldescription. We needn’t speculate on this though. You can go and see some tabotsfor yourself at the British Museum. They were looted from Ethiopia during theNapier Expedition to Magdala in the nineteenth century and brought back toEngland. I don’t think they’re on public display any more, but you’ll find themin the Ethnographic Store in Hackney.’The next morning, after I had made a few phone calls, I drove over to OrsmanRoad, London NI, where the Ethnographic Store was located. It was a modern andfundamentally unattractive building with quite a high level of security: ‘Peoplesometimes try to break in here and nick our stuff,’ explained the caretaker as Isigned in.He took me in a lift to one of the upper floors and then into an enormouswarehouse of a room completely filled with rows of metal filing racks. Theseextended from floor to ceiling and were separated only by narrow walkways badlylit by overhead fluorescent tubes. The caretaker now consulted a voluminousindex, muttering incomprehensibly to himself as he did so. ‘I think it’s thisway,’ he said finally. ‘Follow me.’As we walked I was reminded irresistibly of the closing scene in Raiders of theLost Ark – the scene in which the sacred relic is sealed in a wooden crate anddumped in a federal depository amidst thousands of other anonymous containers.This parallel continued when, after quite a few false turns in the maze ofshelves, we finally arrived at the right spot. Here, with a certain amount ofceremony, the caretaker pulled out … a large box.I felt a thrill of excitement as he opened it up. Inside, however, there wasnothing that bore even the remotest resemblance to my image of the Ark of theCovenant. Separated by sheets of crêpe paper there were, instead, nine woodenslabs, some square, some rectangular, none exceeding eighteen inches in lengthand width, and none more than three inches thick. The majority were very plainbut all bore writing which I recognized as Ge’ez, the ancient liturgicallanguage of Ethiopia. A few were additionally engraved with crosses and otherdevices.I asked the caretaker to check his index. Could he possibly have made a mistake?Could we be looking at the wrong things?He squinted at the list in his hands, then replied: ‘No. No mistake. These areyour tabots all right. From the Holmes collection. Brought back by the BritishExpedition to Abyssinia in 1867/8. That’s what it says here.’I thanked him for his trouble and left, satisfied that I had finally laid thewhole matter to rest. These pathetic lumps of wood were supposed to be replicasof the sacred relic in the sanctuary chapel at Axum. Whatever that relic mightbe, therefore, one thing was now absolutely clear: it was not the Ark of theCovenant.‘So that’s the end of that,’ I remember thinking as I stepped out on to OrsmanRoad and ran to my car through a dismal shower of rain.I could not have been more wrong."},{"pageContent":"PART II: EUROPE, 1989HOLY ARKAND HOLY GRAIL"},{"pageContent":"[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_m02_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE GRAIL CIPHERIt was in 1983 that I visited Axum and learned at first hand about Ethiopia’saudacious claim to be the last resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. I hadbeen living in Africa at the time. In 1984 I moved to England with my family.Nevertheless in the years that followed I continued to travel regularly to AddisAbaba, producing a number of publications for the government and generallystrengthening my contacts with those in power – including President MengistuHaile Mariam himself. The dictator had a bad reputation for abusing human rightsbut I cultivated him assiduously and won a number of useful privileges as aresult – notably access to many areas that were normally closed to foreigners.If I had wanted to look further into the Ark mystery there is no doubt that Iwould have been strongly placed to do so. I was just not interested, however. Itherefore did not feel even a twinge of regret when, at the end of 1988, theforces of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front launched a massive offensiveagainst Axum and captured it in a single day of bloody hand-to-hand fighting –during which more than two thousand of the governments troops were killed orcaptured. At that stage my involvement with the Mengistu regime had become soclose that the rebels’ success meant the doors of the sacred city were noweffectively closed to me. But I had no particular reason to want to go backthere anyway. Or at least so I thought.THE QUEEN OF SHEBA AT CHARTRESI spent most of the second half of 1988 and the first quarter of 1989 writingthe accompanying commentary for an illustrated book focussing on the historicnorthern regions of Ethiopia and on the religious ceremonies and customs of thepeoples living there. This project was not commissioned by the government butwas the work of two internationally renowned photographers, Angela Fisher andCarol Beckwith1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts1] – both of whomwere close friends of mine.Because of the nature of the subject, I had to do some quite detailed backgroundresearch into several different ethnic groups – amongst them the Falashas, theindigenous black Jews of the Ethiopian highlands whom I had first encountered in1983. At the same time, because of its formative role in Abyssinian religiousculture, I found it necessary to read an ancient text to which Professor RichardPankhurst had long before drawn my attention. Called the Kebra Nagast (‘Glory ofKings’) this text dated from the thirteenth century AD and had originally beenwritten in Ge’ez. It contained the earliest-surviving version of the story toldto me in Axum about the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon, the birth of their sonMenelik, and the eventual abduction of the Ark of the Covenant from the FirstTemple in Jerusalem. An English translation had been made in the 1920s by Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, formerly Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at theBritish Museum. It was out of print, but I managed to obtain a photocopy which Istudied closely and drew on at various stages in the book I was writing.My manuscript was not finalized until the end of March 1989. In April, wanting acomplete break, I went on holiday to France with my family. We hired a car inParis and then, with no particular itinerary in mind, headed south. Our firststop was Versailles where we spent a couple of days looking at the palace and atthe châteaux. Then we went on to Chartres, a lovely old town in the départementof Eure-et-Loire that is famous for its Gothic cathedral – a cathedraldedicated, like the great church at Axum, to Saint Mary the Mother of Christ.Chartres has been an important Christian site since at least the sixth centuryAD and a focal point for the cult of the Madonna since the ninth century whenCharles the Bald, grandson of the famous Charlemagne, presented the town withits most precious religious relic – a veil said to have been worn by Mary whenshe gave birth to Jesus. In the eleventh century the church built by Charles theBald was burnt down and a new, much enlarged, cathedral was erected on itsfoundations. Following classical, ‘Romanesque’ design principles that emphasizedhorizontal solidity, this cathedral, too, was badly damaged by fire.Subsequently, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, its surviving shellwas extensively modified and enlarged in the new, soaring, upward-striving stylethat came to be known as ‘Gothic’. Indeed the high north tower of Chartrescathedral, completed in the year 1134, is thought to be the world’s earliestexample of Gothic architecture.2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts2]The south tower was added over the next two decades, as were further featuressuch as the west-facing Royal Portal. Then, in a concentrated burst of buildingbetween 1194 and 1225 most of the rest of the superb Gothic exterior was put inplace – remaining intact and virtually unaltered ever since.3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts3]When I visited Chartres with my family in April 1989 I was initially much lessinterested in the history of the cathedral than in its spectacular and gloriousbeauty. It was such a vast construction, with so much complex sculpture aroundits walls, that I realized it might take a lifetime to get to know it properly.We had other things to do and see, however, and decided to stay in the town forjust three days before moving on towards the south.I spent the greater part of those three days walking slowly around thecathedral, gradually imbibing its powerful and numinous atmosphere – theremarkable stained glass windows telling biblical stories and illuminating theinner gloom with strange patterns of light, the enigmatic labyrinth mapped outwith paving stones in the centre of the nave, the flying buttresses supportingthe soaring walls, the pointed arches, and the overwhelming sensation of harmonyand proportion conveyed by the grace and agility of the architecture.Guidebooks that I had purchased stressed that nothing was accidental here. Theentire edifice had been carefully and explicitly designed as a key to the deeperreligious mysteries. Thus, for example, the architects and masons had made useof gematria (an ancient Hebrew cipher that substitutes numbers for the lettersof the alphabet) to ‘spell out’ obscure liturgical phrases in many of the keydimensions of the great building.4 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts4]Similarly the sculptors and glaziers – working usually to the instructions ofthe higher clergy – had carefully concealed complex messages about human nature,about the past, and about the prophetic meaning of the Scriptures in thethousands of different devices and designs that they had created. The statuesand windows were in themselves works of art and beauty that were capable, at themost superficial level of understanding, of providing satisfaction, moralguidance and even entertainment to the viewer. The challenge, however, was todelve deeper and to decode the information concealed beneath the more obvioussurface interpretations of this or that set of sculptures, this or thatarrangement of stained glass.5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts5]I was initially rather unconvinced by arguments like these and found it hard toaccept that there could be anything more to the building than its outwardappearance. Gradually, however, as I explored further and joined severalspecialist tours, I began to see that the vast structure was indeed a kind of‘book in stone’ – an intricate and provocative opus that could be approached andunderstood at several different levels.Soon enough, therefore, I too started to play the game – and several timesentertained myself by trying to work out the deeper significance of variouspieces of statuary that caught my eye. When I thought I had found the correctanswer to a particular arrangement or tableau I would then check in theguidebooks to see whether I was right or not.Then something unexpected happened. Opposite the cathedral’s south porch Istopped for a snack in a café called La Reine de Saba. My recent reading of theKebra Nagast containing the Ethiopian legend of the Queen of Sheba was stillfresh in my mind and I asked one of the waiters why this name had been chosen.‘Because there is a sculpture of the Queen of Sheba in the porch over there,’ heexplained.My curiosity aroused, I crossed the road and climbed the seventeen steps to theornate porch – which consisted of a wide central archway sandwiched between twoslightly narrower bays. Here, on almost every available square inch of masonry,were hundreds and hundreds of statuettes and many full-size statues. I couldfind none, however, that seemed obviously to represent the Queen of Sheba. Itherefore checked in the guidebooks I had with me, the most detailed of which,Chartres: Guide of the Cathedral, told me where to look:The inner archivolt of the outer arch has twenty-eight statuettes of kings andqueens of the Old Testament: we recognise David with his harp, Solomon with asceptre, and the Queen of Sheba holding a flower in her left hand. At the top,the four major prophets, bearded, talk with four minor prophets who are cleanshaven.6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts6]The book also informed me that the whole of the south porch had been built inthe first quarter of the thirteenth century – the same century in which theKebra Nagast had been compiled in Ethiopia to tell the story of the Queen ofSheba, Menelik and the theft of the Ark.This struck me as an amusing coincidence and I therefore examined the statuetteof the Queen of Sheba with some considerable interest. I could see absolutelynothing about it, however, that made it special in any way – other than the factthat it seemed to be a little out of place in the august company of a largenumber of Jewish monarchs and prophets. I knew that according to the KebraNagast the queen had been converted to Judaism,7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts7] but I also knew that therelatively short biblical account of her visit to Jerusalem made no mention ofthis. In Chapter 10 of the book of Kings and in Chapter 9 of the book ofChronicles – the only places where she was specifically named in the Scriptures– she arrived at Solomon’s court a heathen and apparently left there a heathenstill.8 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts8] It was her paganism,therefore, that made her the odd one out – unless, of course, the builders ofChartres cathedral had been familiar with the Ethiopian story of her conversion.This, however, seemed most unlikely – indeed the Old Testament did not even hintthat she might have come from Ethiopia at all and the majority of scholarsbelieved her to have been a South Arabian monarch who had hailed quitespecifically from Saba or Sabaea in what is now the Yemen.9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts9]I might very well have left the matter there, as a minor anomaly amongst thesculptures in the south porch of Chartres cathedral, if I had not discovered, byreading further in my guidebook, that there was a second statue of the Queen ofSheba in the north porch. That porch, too, had been built between the years 1200and 1225, and was devoted to an extensive portrayal of Old Testament themes.10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts10]THE ARK AND THE INSCRIPTIONSI suppose, on that first visit, that I spent two hours in the north porch tryingto puzzle out the convoluted stories told by the sculptures.The left bay contained several representations of the Virgin Mary and of theinfant Christ together with Old Testament prophets like Isaiah and Daniel. Therewere also moral tales – notably one which portrayed the triumph of the Virtuesover the Vices, and another which depicted the beatitudes of the body and soulas described by the great twelfth-century cleric Saint Bernard of Clairvaux.The central bay was dominated by a group of Old Testament patriarchs andprophets, notably the figure of Melchizedek – the mysterious priest-king ofSalem described in Chapter 14 of the book of Genesis and in Psalm 110.11[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts11] Abraham, Moses, Samuel and Davidwere there also, as were Elisha and Saint Peter. Other scenes included theGarden of Eden, with its four rivers, and the Virgin Mary crowned and seated onthe heavenly throne beside Jesus.It was in the right bay that I found the Queen of Sheba. This time she was notan obscure statuette on the arch, as had been the case in the south porch, butrather a full-size statue. She was placed next to a figure of Solomon, whichmade sense given the biblical context. What immediately caught my eye, however,was that beneath her feet crouched an African – described in one of myguidebooks as ‘her negroid servant’,12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts12] and in another as ‘her Ethiopianslave’.13 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts13]No further details were given. Nevertheless I had seen enough to be satisfiedthat the sculptors who had worked in the north porch of Chartres in thethirteenth century had wanted to place the queen unmistakably in an Africancontext. This meant that I could no longer so easily dismiss the possibilitythat those sculptors might have been familiar with the Ethiopian traditionsabout her which, in the thirteenth century, had been set down in the KebraNagast. That, at least, would explain why an apparently pagan monarch had beengiven so much importance in the iconography of a Christian cathedral: as notedabove, it had only been in the Kebra Nagast, and not in the Bible, that she hadbeen described as a convert to the true faith of the patriarchs. At the sametime, however, it raised another difficult question: how and by what means couldthe Ethiopian story have filtered into northern France at so early a date?It was with such thoughts passing through my mind that, on a column between thecentral and right-hand bays, I came across a piece of sculpture that was to havean even more powerful impact on me. Miniaturized – no more than a few incheshigh and wide – it depicted a box or chest of some sort being transported on anox-cart. Beneath it, in capital letters, were carved these two words:ARCHA CEDERISMoving on around the column in an anti-clockwise direction I then found aseparate scene, badly damaged and eroded, which seemed to show a man stoopingover the same box or chest. There was an inscription here, too, a littledifficult to make out:HIC AMICITUR ARCHA CEDERIS (or possibly HICAMITTITUR ARCHA CEDERIS, or HICAMITITUR ARCHA CEDERIS, or even HICAMIGITUR ARCHA CEDERIS).The style of the lettering was archaic, jumbled up and obscure. I realized thatit must be Latin, or a form of Latin. However, having been obliged by myschoolmasters to abandon that subject at the age of thirteen (on account of myown linguistic incompetence), I made no attempt at a full translation. It seemedto me, however, that the word ARCHA must mean ‘Ark’ – as in Ark of the Covenant.I could also see that the box or chest depicted in the sculptures was about theright size (scaled against the other figures) to have been the Ark described inthe book of Exodus.14 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts14]If I was correct in this assumption, I reasoned, then the positioning of animage of the Ark within a very few feet of an image of the Queen of Shebastrengthened the hypothesis that the builders of Chartres might, in some as yetunexplained way, have been influenced by the Ethiopian traditions set down inthe Kebra Nagast. Indeed the fact the sculptors had placed the queen sounambiguously in an African context made this hypothesis look much moreplausible than it had seemed when it had first occurred to me in the southporch. I therefore felt that it would be worth my while to establish whether theminiaturized devices on the columns were really images of the Ark and to workout the meaning of the Latin inscriptions.I sat down on the paving of the north porch and pored through my guidebooks.Only two of them made any mention at all of the decorations on the columns I wasinterested in. One offered no translation of the inscriptions but confirmed thatthe scenes depicted did indeed relate to the Ark of the Covenant.15[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts15] The other provided the followingtranslation – which I found interesting, but also rather suspect:ARCHA CEDERIS: ‘You are to work through the Ark.’HIC AMITITUR ARCHA CEDERIS: ‘Here things take their course; you are to workthrough the Ark.’16 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts16]Even my schoolboy Latin was sufficient to suggest that these interpretationswere probably incorrect. I therefore decided that I would have to refer thematter to an expert for clarification and it occurred to me that in just a fewdays I would be passing quite close to the home of a man well qualified to help– Professor Peter Lasko, an art historian and a former director of theUniversity of London’s Courtauld Institute, who now spent six months of everyyear living in southern France. The father of a close friend of mine, Lasko hadmade a lifetime study of the sacred art and architecture of the medieval periodand could probably give me an authoritative opinion – or at any rate point me inthe right direction.Accordingly I carefully copied out the inscriptions and then stood up to try toproduce a sketch of the whole north porch. As I was doing so I noticed somethingelse that was possibly significant: the Ark tableau, though standing to thefront of the porch on the supporting columns, was positioned exactly midwaybetween Melchizedek, the Old Testament priest-king whose statue dominated thecentral bay, and the statue of the Queen of Sheba, which dominated theright-hand bay. Indeed I found that I could draw a neat triangle connecting upall three pieces of sculpture – with Melchizedek and the Queen of Sheba ateither end of the long base and the Ark of the Covenant at the apex of the twoshorter sides.Nor was this all. As I studied the layout of images in the two bays I realizedthat the Ark on its little cart had been depicted as moving away fromMelchizedek and directly towards the Queen of Sheba – along the side of thetriangle I had drawn. Given the cryptic nature of much of the sculpture atChartres, and the way in which different figures were often deliberatelyjuxtaposed in order to tell stories and convey information, it seemed to me thatthis particular arrangement was unlikely to have been accidental. On thecontrary it looked very much like another piece of evidence to support myevolving hypothesis that the builders of Chartres must, somehow, have beenexposed to the Ethiopian legend of the Queen of Sheba as related in the KebraNagast. Though there was far too little to go on here to justify any firmconclusions, it was at least possible that the curious iconography of the northporch did contain echoes of the tradition that the Ark of the Covenant had beentaken away from ancient Israel (represented by the priest-king Melchizedek) andto Ethiopia (represented by the Queen of Sheba).I therefore paid special attention to the statue of Melchizedek before leavingthe north porch. He had caught my eye when I had first arrived, but now, as Isketched him, I began to notice more details. Dangling beneath his right hand,for example, was a censer very similar to those that I had often seen in use inEthiopian church services – where copious quantities of incense were routinelyburned. Meanwhile he held in his left hand a long-stemmed chalice or cupcontaining not liquid but rather some sort of solid cylindrical object.I searched through my guidebooks again, but could find no reference to thecenser and only conflicting explanations of the cup. One source said thatMelchizedek was intended here to be viewed as a precursor of Christ and that thechalice and the object within it were thus meant to represent ‘the bread and thewine, the symbols of the Eucharist’.17[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts17] Another captioned its photographof the statue with these words: ‘Melchizedek bearing the Grail cup out of whichcomes the Stone’, and then added (somewhat puzzlingly):With this we may connect the poem of Wolfram von Eschenbach, who is said to havebeen a Templar – though there is no proof of this – for whom the Grail is aStone.18 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts18]None the wiser, I eventually left the north porch and joined my wife andchildren in the gardens behind the great cathedral. The next day we drove southfrom Chartres in the direction of Bordeaux and Biarritz. And some time afterthat, now heading east towards the Côte d’azur, we arrived in the département ofTarn-et-Garonne near the city of Toulouse. There, with the aid of a good map, Ieventually found the home of the art historian Professor Peter Lasko whom I hadtelephoned from Chartres and who had expressed a willingness to talk to me aboutthe sculptures in the north porch – though, he had modestly added, he could notclaim to be an expert on them.AN ETHIOPIAN CONNECTION?I spent an afternoon with Peter Lasko at his house in the village of Montaigu deQuercy. A distinguished, grey-haired man in his sixties, I had met him severaltimes before and he knew that, as a writer, I specialized in Ethiopia and theHorn of Africa. He therefore began by asking me why I had suddenly taken aninterest in medieval French cathedrals.I replied by outlining my theory that the sculptures I had seen in the northporch of Chartres might in some way have been influenced by the Kebra Nagast:‘Melchizedek with his cup could represent Old Testament Israel,’ I concluded.‘He was priest-king of Salem, after all, which a number of scholars haveidentified with Jerusalem.19 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts19] Thenthe Queen of Sheba with her African servant could represent Ethiopia. And thenwe have the Ark between the two, going in the direction of Ethiopia. So themessage would be that the Ark had gone from Jerusalem to Ethiopia – which isexactly what the Kebra Nagast says. How does that sound to you?’‘To be perfectly honest, Graham, it sounds preposterous.’‘Why?’‘Well … I suppose it’s just possible that Ethiopian traditions could havefiltered into Europe as early as the thirteenth century – in fact, come to thinkof it, there has been at least one scholarly paper which does suggest that thiscould have happened. I rather doubt that view myself. Nevertheless, even if theKebra Nagast story was known in Chartres at the right time I just don’t see whyanyone would have felt motivated to translate it into the iconography of thecathedral. That would have been a most peculiar thing to do – particularly inthe north porch which is mainly about the Old Testament forerunners of Christ.Melchizedek is there for that very reason, by the way. He’s specificallyidentified with Christ in the book of Hebrews.’20[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts20]‘He’s shown holding a cup in the sculpture and there’s also some kind ofcylindrical object in the cup.’‘Probably meant to represent bread – the bread and the wine of the Eucharist.’‘That’s what one of my guidebooks says. But there’s another one which identifiesthe cup with the Holy Grail and which argues that the cylindrical object is astone.’Peter Lasko raised a quizzical eyebrow. ‘I’ve never heard such a thing before.It sounds even more far-fetched than your theory of an Ethiopian connection …’He paused reflectively, then added: ‘There is one thing though. That scholarlypaper which I mentioned – the one that talks about Ethiopian ideas finding theirway into medieval Europe …’‘Yes.’‘Well oddly enough it’s about the Holy Grail. If I remember rightly it arguesthat Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Grail – which was a stone, not a cup – wasinfluenced by some sort of Christian Ethiopian tradition.’I sat forward in my chair: ‘That’s interesting … Wolfram von Eschenbach was alsomentioned in my guidebook. Who was he?’‘One of the earliest of the medieval poets to concern himself with the HolyGrail. He wrote a book-length work on the subject called Parzival.’‘Isn’t that the name of an opera?’‘Yes, by Wagner. He was inspired by Wolfram.’‘And this Wolfram … when did he write?’‘Late twelfth or early thirteenth century.’‘In other words at the same time that the north porch of Chartres cathedral wasbuilt?’‘Yes.’We both remained silent for a while, then I said: ‘The paper that you told meabout which argues that Wolfram’s work was influenced by Ethiopian traditions –I don’t suppose you happen to remember the title of it do you?’‘… Ah. No. I’m afraid not. It must have been at least twenty years ago when Iread it. It was by someone or other Adolf, I think. That name sticks in my mind,anyway. Wolfram was a German so you really need to talk to a specialist inMiddle High German literature to find out more details.’Silently resolving that I would do just that, I then asked Peter if he couldhelp me with a translation of the inscriptions that had so intrigued me atChartres. My guidebook, I told him, had rendered ARCHA CEDERIS as ‘You are towork through the Ark’ and HIC AMITITUR ARCHA CEDERIS as ‘Here things take theircourse; you are to work through the Ark.’ These interpretations, however, werein his view completely wrong. ARCHA certainly meant Ark and CEDERIS was mostprobably a corruption of FOEDERIS – meaning Covenant. On this reading,therefore, ARCHA CEDERIS would translate very simply and logically as ‘Ark ofthe Covenant’. Another alternative, however, was that the word CEDERIS wasintended as a form of the verb cedere – meaning to yield or to give up or to goaway. The tense was unorthodox, but the best translation of ARCHA CEDERIS ifthis was the case would be ‘the Ark that you will yield’ (or ‘give up’ or ‘sendaway’).As to the longer inscription, the problem was the obscurity of the fourth letterof the second word. My guidebook had presumed it to be a single ‘T’. It was muchmore likely to be an abbreviation representing a double ‘T’, however (becausethere was no Latin word spelt AMITITUR with a single ‘T’). If a double ‘T’ hadindeed been intended then the phrase would read HIC AMITTITUR ARCHA CEDERIS,meaning something like ‘Here it is let go, the Ark that you will yield’, orperhaps ‘Here it is let go, Oh Ark, you are yielded’, or alternatively – ifCEDERIS was a corruption of FOEDERIS – ‘Here it is let go, the Ark of theCovenant’.It was also possible, however, that the fourth letter of the second word was a‘C’ of some kind (which was actually what it looked like). If so then therelevant phrase became HIC AMICITUR ARCHA CEDERIS – which would translate eitheras ‘Here is hidden the Ark of the Covenant’, or ‘Here is hidden the Ark that youwill yield’ (or ‘give up’ or ‘send away’).‘Even the word “hidden” isn’t definite,’ concluded Peter as he closed his Latindictionary. ‘Amicitur in this context could equally well mean “covered up” –although that does convey the same sort of idea doesn’t it? I don’t know. Thewhole thing’s a bit of a puzzle really.’I agreed wholeheartedly with him on this point. The whole thing was indeed apuzzle. It was, moreover, a puzzle that I felt challenged, intrigued andtantalized by and that I very much wanted to solve.During the remainder of my holiday in France my thoughts kept wandering back tothe north porch of Chartres where I had seen the little sculptures. What I couldnot forget was the way in which the relic on its ox-cart had appeared to bemoving towards the Queen of Sheba; nor could I dismiss from my mind thepossibility that this suggested movement or a journey towards Ethiopia.I knew that I was indulging in wild speculation for which there was no academicjustification whatsoever and I fully accepted Peter Lasko’s argument that thesculptors of Chartres would not have allowed themselves to be influenced by anEthiopian legend in their choice of subject matter. This, however, left me witha much more exciting possibility to contemplate: perhaps those responsible forthe north porch of the cathedral (which had also been called ‘the door of theinitiates’21 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts21]) had been drawing acryptic map for future generations to follow – a map that hinted at the locationof the most sacred and precious treasure that the world had ever known. Perhapsthey had discovered that the Ark of the Covenant really had been let go, oryielded (or sent away?) from Israel in Old Testament times and that it hadsubsequently been hidden (or covered up?) in Ethiopia. Perhaps this was the truemeaning of the little sculptures with their puzzling inscriptions. If so thenthe implications were truly breathtaking and the Axumite traditions that I hadso readily dismissed in 1983 would, at the very least, merit a close secondlook.MARY, THE GRAIL AND THE ARKWhen I returned from France at the end of April 1989 I set my research assistantto work on the problem of the scholarly paper that Peter Lasko had mentioned tome. I knew that it might have been written by someone named Adolf and I knewthat the subject matter had to do with a possible Ethiopian influence on Wolframvon Eschenbach’s story of the Holy Grail. I did not know where, or when, thepaper had been published, or even in what language, but I advised my researcherto contact the universities to see if there were any specialists on medievalGerman literature who might be able to help.While waiting for an answer on this I went out and bought a number of differentversions of the Grail ‘romance’. These included Chrétien de Troyes’s Conte duGraal, left unfinished by the author in AD 1182,22[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts22] Sir Thomas Malory’s Le MorteD’arthur, a much later epic dated to the mid-fifteenth century,23[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts23] and last but not least Parzival,which Wolfram von Eschenbach was thought to have written between the years 1195and 121024 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts24] – dates that coincidedalmost exactly with the main phase of construction work on the north porch ofChartres cathedral.I began to read these books and initially found Malory’s the most accessible –since it had been the inspiration for a number of stories and films dealing withthe quest for the Holy Grail that I had enjoyed as a child.I quickly discovered, however, that Malory had presented an idealized, sanitizedand above all Christianized account of ‘the only true quest’. Wolfram’s story,by contrast, was more earthy, provided a more accurate portrayal of therealities of human behaviour, and – most important of all – was completelydevoid of New Testament symbolism where the Grail itself was concerned.In Malory the sacred relic was described as a ‘vessel of gold’ carried by a‘perfect clean maiden’ and containing ‘part of the blood of Our Lord JesusChrist’.25 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts25] This, as I was wellaware, was precisely the image that had long been enshrined in popular culture,where the Grail was always portrayed as a cup or a bowl (usually that in whichJoseph of Arimathea caught a few drops of Christ’s blood when the Saviour hungsuffering on the cross).I myself had been so influenced by this conception that I found it difficult tothink of the Grail as anything other than a cup. When I turned to Wolfram’sParzival, however, I found confirmation of what I had learned in France, namelythat the relic – although carried by a maiden just as in Malory – was depictedas a stone:However ill a mortal man may be, from the day on which he sees the Stone hecannot die for that week, nor does he lose his colour. For if anyone, maid orman, were to look at the Gral for two hundred years, you would have to admitthat his colour was as fresh as in his early prime … Such powers does the Stoneconfer on mortal men that their flesh and bones are soon made young again. ThisStone is called ‘The Gral’.26 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts26]I was struck by this odd and compelling imagery, and it raised a naggingquestion in my mind: why should the Morte D’arthur have depicted the Grail as ‘avessel’ when the far earlier Parzival had unambiguously described it as ‘aStone’? What was going on here?I investigated further and learnt from one authority on quest literature thatMalory was ‘merely embroidering a theme, the meaning of which [he] did notunderstand’ when he wrote the Morte D’arthur.27[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts27] That theme had been mostdefinitively spelled out in Wolfram’s Parzival and in Chrétien de Troyes’s Contedu Graal,28 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts28] both of which weremore than two hundred years older than the Morte.Encouraged by this advice I turned to my copy of Chrétien’s unfinished story andthere read the following description of the Grail – the first in literature(and, for that matter, in history). As in both Wolfram and Malory, the preciousobject was carried by a damsel:Once she had entered with this grail that she held, so great a radiance appearedthat the candles lost their brilliance just as the stars do at the rising of thesun and the moon … The grail … was of pure refined gold [and] was set with manykinds of precious stones, the richest and most costly in sea or earth.29[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts29]At no point, I discovered, did Chrétien’s manuscript explicitly state that theGrail was a cup or bowl. It was clear from the context, however, that this wasprecisely what he saw it as. In several places he referred to a centralcharacter – ‘the Fisher King’ – being ‘served from the grail’,30[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts30] and later added: ‘he’s servedwith a single consecrated wafer brought to him in that grail – that supports hislife in full vigour, so holy a thing is the grail’.31[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts31] On checking further I learnedthat the very word ‘grail’ was itself derived from the Old French gradale (Latingradalis) meaning ‘a wide and somewhat hollowed-out vessel in which deliciousfood is served’. In the colloquial parlance of Chrétien’s day gradale was oftenpronounced greal. And even in more recent times grazal, grazau, and grialcontinued to be used in parts of the south of France to denote receptacles ofvarious kinds.32 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts32]Here, therefore, was the origin of Malory’s conception of the sacred object as avessel. Other than the mention of ‘a consecrated wafer’, however, Chrétien’streatment offered no unequivocal connections with Christianity (not even in thenotion of the Grail being a ‘holy thing’ – which could as easily have beeninspired by the Old Testament as by the New33[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts33]). Like Wolfram, the French poetdid not mention Christ’s blood at all and certainly did not suggest that therelic was a container for it.It followed that the ‘sacred blood’ imagery associated with the Grail in popularculture was a gloss added by later authors – a gloss that broadened, but also tosome extent obscured, the original theme. With a little more work on the subjectI was able to satisfy myself that this process of ‘Christianization’ had beensponsored by the Cistercian monastic order.34[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts34] And the Cistercians in their turnhad been profoundly influenced and shaped by one man – Saint Bernard ofClairvaux, who had joined the Order in the year 1112 and who was regarded bymany scholars as the most significant religious figure of his era.35[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts35]This same Saint Bernard, I then discovered, had also played a formative role inthe evolution and dissemination of the Gothic architectural formula in its earlydays (he had been at the height of his powers in 1134 when the soaring northtower of Chartres cathedral had been built, and he had constantly stressed theprinciples of sacred geometry that had been put into practice in that tower andthroughout the whole wonderful building).36[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts36] Moreover, long after his death in1153, his sermons and ideas had continued to serve as prime sources ofinspiration for the further evolution of Gothic architecture and also forstatuary and sculptures like those I had seen in the north porch at Chartres.37[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts37]The principal bridge between the earlier non-Christian versions of the story ofthe Holy Grail and the stylized New Testament tract that it had become byMalory’s time had been formed by the so-called Queste del Saint Graal – compiledby Cistercian monks in the thirteenth century.38[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts38] Moreover, although he was alreadydead when this great anthology was begun, it seemed to me that the strong handof Saint Bernard could also be seen at work here – reaching out from beyond thegrave as it were. I arrived at this conclusion because, in his extensivewritings, this immensely influential cleric had propounded a mystical view ofChrist’s blood, a view that was incorporated by the compilers of the Queste intotheir new concept of the Grail itself.39[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts39] From now on Wolfram’s Stone wascompletely forgotten and Chrétien’s ‘vessel’, although preserved, was filled upwith the blood of Christ.What I found interesting about this notion was the way in which it hadimmediately begun to be interpreted by the church. In hymns, sermons andepistles, I learned, subsequent generations of Christians all over Europe hadgone to great lengths to equate the Grail symbolically with the Blessed VirginMary – to whom, I remembered, Chartres cathedral had been dedicated. Thereasoning underlying this pious allegory was as follows: the Grail (according tothe Queste and other later recensions of the legend) contained the holy blood ofChrist; before she gave birth to him, Mary had contained Christ himself withinher womb; therefore, QED, the Grail was – and always had been – a symbol forMary.40 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts40]According to this logic, Mary Theotokos, the ‘God Bearer’, was the sacred vesselwho had contained the Spirit made flesh. Thus, in the sixteenth-century Litanyof Loretto,41 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts41] she was the vasspirituale (spiritual vessel), the vas honorabile (vessel of honour), and thevas insigne devotionis (singular vessel of devotion).42[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts42]Why did this symbolism attract my attention? Quite simply because the Litany ofLoretto had also referred to the Blessed Virgin as arca foederis43[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts43] – which, as I already knew, wasLatin for ‘the Ark of the Covenant’. I researched this coincidence further anddiscovered that the Litany was not the only place in which it cropped up. In thetwelfth century, the redoubtable Saint Bernard of Clairvaux had also explicitlycompared Mary to the Ark of the Covenant – indeed he had done so in a number ofhis writings.44 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts44] And as early asthe fourth century Saint Ambrose, the Bishop of Milan, had preached a sermon inwhich he had argued that the Ark had been a prophetic allegory for Mary: just asit had contained the Old Law in the form of the Ten Commandments, so she hadcontained the New Law in the form of the body of Christ.45[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts45]I was subsequently to discover that concepts like these had persisted into thetwentieth century and had been woven into the fabric of modern Christianworship. On a trip to Israel, for example, I came across a small and beautifulDominican church built in 1924 and dedicated A la Vièrge Marie Arche d’alliance– in other words ‘To the Virgin Mary Ark of the Covenant’. The church stood atKiriath-Jearim, overlooking the road between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and itsseven-metre steeple was topped off with a full-sized representation of the Ark.There were also several paintings of the sacred relic arranged around theinterior walls of the building itself. During my visit I was given the following(very ‘Ambrosian’) explanation of the dedication – and of the symbolism – by asenior church official, Sister Raphael Mikhail:‘We compare Mary to a living Ark. Mary was the mother of Jesus, who was themaster of the Law and of the Covenant. The tablets of stone with the TenCommandments of the Law were placed inside the Ark by Moses; so also God placedJesus in the womb of Mary. So she is the living Ark.’It seemed to me highly significant that both the Ark and the Grail, apparentlyso different, should nevertheless have been compared repeatedly to the samebiblical personality, and in exactly the same way. If Mary was both a ‘livingArk’ and a ‘living Grail’, I speculated, then surely this suggested that the twosacred objects might not in fact have been so very different – that they might,indeed, have been one and the same thing.This struck me as a truly electrifying possibility. And, farfetched though it atfirst appeared, it did shed interesting light on the choice and juxtaposition ofstatuary in the north porch of Chartres cathedral. If I was correct thenMelchizedek’s ‘Grail’ cup with the ‘Stone’ inside it would at one level haverepresented Mary but could, at another, have been intended to serve as anesoteric symbol for the Ark of the Covenant and for the stone tablets that ithad contained.Such an interpretation, I felt, added considerable weight to the hypothesis thatthe other iconography of the north porch signalled the removal of the sacredrelic to Ethiopia. But I also realized that I had no really firm grounds onwhich to base a conclusion of this magnitude – only coincidence, guesswork and astrong intuition that I might be on to something important.I have always been inclined to follow my intuitions to see where they lead.However, it seemed to me that if I was going to involve myself in a proper,thorough, expensive and time-consuming investigation then I needed somethingrather more solid to go on than a few happy accidents and presentiments.I did not have to wait long. In June 1989 my researcher finally managed tolocate the academic paper that, according to Peter Lasko, had suggested apossible Ethiopian influence on the portrayal of the Holy Grail in Wolfram vonEschenbach’s Parzival. The encouragement given to me by that paper launched meon the quest that was to dominate my life for the next two years.LITERARY INFLUENCE – OR SOMETHING MORE?The paper, entitled ‘New Light on Oriental Sources for Wolfram’s Parzival’, hadappeared in 1947 in the academic journal PMLA (Publications of the ModernLanguages Association of America).46[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts46] The author was Helen Adolf, ahighly regarded medievalist who had taken a special interest in the literarypedigree of the Holy Grail. The thesis that she put forward (for which sheadmitted that she was indebted to two earlier authorities47[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts47]) was that Wolfram – althoughlargely influenced by Chrétien de Troyes – must also ‘have known, besidesChrétien, a Grail story in Oriental setting’.48[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts48]When I began to read Helen Adolf’s paper I was already aware, from thebackground research that I had done, that Chrétien de Troyes had effectively‘invented’ the Grail in 1182. Prior to that date it had existed neither inhistory, nor in myth. Most authorities on the subject agreed that there wereearlier legends – dealing, for example, with magic cauldrons, heroic quests, anddeeds of chivalry done by King Arthur and his Knights – which the courtly poetsand raconteurs had drawn upon to add texture to their Grail stories.49[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts49] These older lays, however, whichhad been handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation, had beentoo well known, too ‘tried and tested’, in short too familiar to all and sundry,to have provided the creative impulse for the distinct cycle of romances thatChrétien initiated in the late twelfth century.The great French poet had never finished his famous Conte du Graal. Within avery few years, however, Wolfram von Eschenbach capitalized on the good startthat had been made, extending and completing his predecessor’s story – while atthe same time rather churlishly accusing Chrétien of ‘doing wrong’ by it andadding that his own German text was the ‘authentic tale’.50[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts50]What made such protestations seem odd was the fact that Wolfram had obviouslylifted many details directly from the Conte du Graal and, by and large, hadremained faithful to its plot and characters.51[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts51] Indeed there was only oneglaringly obvious difference – the bizarre innovation of making the Grail aStone. The motive for this innovation did, therefore, look like a genuinemystery to some scholars. It could not have been a simple mistake on Wolfram’spart – he was much too clever and precise a raconteur to have made an error ofsuch significance. The only reasonable conclusion, therefore, was that he haddescribed the relic in the way he did for some special reason of his own.It was to precisely this question that Helen Adolf addressed herself in hershort paper. And she offered an answer to it that I found most intriguing.Somehow or other, she argued, Wolfram must have gained access to the KebraNagast, enjoyed the story about the Ark of the Covenant being removed fromJerusalem to Axum, and decided to work elements of it into his own Parzival. Theinfluence was only ‘indirect’, she thought; nevertheless the most likelyexplanation for the curious character of Wolfram’s Grail could be traced to theuse, ‘in every Abyssinian church’, of what she described as ‘a so-called Tabot,a slab of wood or stone’.52 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts52]Adolf explained that this practice had its origins in the religious traditionsset down in the Kebra Nagast – an observation that I knew to be correct. In 1983I had learned that Tabot was the local name for the sacred relic – believed tobe the Ark of the Covenant – that Menelik had supposedly brought from Jerusalemand that was now kept in the sanctuary chapel at Axum. Moreover, as the readerwill recall, I had subsequently discovered, as Adolf also affirmed, that eachand every Ethiopian Orthodox church possessed its own tabot. These objects,which were often spoken of as replicas of the original in Axum, were not boxesor chests but took the form of flat slabs. The ones I had seen had all been madeof wood. Researching the matter further, however, I discovered that many wereindeed made of stone.53 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts53]On the basis of several comparisons Adolf asserted that Wolfram, too, had knownthis and had derived his Grail-Stone from the Ethiopian tabot. She also pointedout that not all the characters in Parzival had been borrowed from Chrétien deTroyes; there were a few additional figures whose origins were mysterious andwho might well have been inspired by the Kebra Nagast. She could offer no solidexplanation as to how the German raconteur could have become familiar with theKebra Nagast but suggested rather tentatively that wandering Jews might havebrought it to Europe. In the medieval period, she pointed out, ‘the Jews werenot only the mediators between Arabs and Christians in general. They had aspecial stake in Ethiopia, where they formed, and still form, an important partof the population.’54 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts54]I found Adolf’s arguments persuasive but extremely limited in scope. She hadconfined herself to the specialized field of literary criticism, and accordinglyher concerns had been of an entirely literary nature. Having set out to provethe possibility of a connection between the Kebra Nagast and Parzival (with theformer ‘indirectly influencing’ the latter) she had been quite happy to stopwhen she felt she had achieved this goal. I was enormously grateful to her,however, because she had opened my eyes to something far more exciting –something of infinitely greater significance.On the basis of the comparisons cited earlier between the Ark of the Covenant,the Holy Grail, and Mary the Mother of Christ, I had already begun to wonderwhether the identities of the Ark and the Grail were really as distinct andseparate as they seemed at first sight. Now it occurred to me that if Wolfram’sGrail looked as if it had been influenced by Ethiopian traditions concerning theArk then there was just a chance that there could be more to this – perhaps muchmore – than Helen Adolf had ever guessed. To cut a long story short, I began towonder whether the German poet might not have deliberately constructed hisfictional Grail as a kind of ‘code’ for the real and historical Ark. If so thenthe quest that formed the central theme of Parzival could also be a code thatmight, like some cryptic treasure map, point the way to the last resting placeof the Ark itself.I had already become intrigued by the possibility that a similar code in thenorth porch of Chartres cathedral – though carved in stone rather than writtenin a book – might hint that the relic had been taken to Ethiopia. It wastherefore with real enthusiasm and excitement that I set out to try to ‘decode’Parzival.CELESTIAL WRITING, LAWS AND ORACLESIt seemed to me that my initial task should be to determine whether Wolfram’sGrail could indeed have been designed as a sort of cryptogram for the Ark of theCovenant. To this end I decided that I would temporarily postpone furtherexamination of the Ethiopian connection suggested by Adolf. Instead I would lookfor direct parallels between the characteristics of the Grail and thecharacteristics of the Ark as described in the Old Testament and other ancientJewish sources. Only if those parallels proved persuasive would there be anypoint in going further.The first thing that attracted my attention was the way in which Wolfram hadtransformed Chrétien’s Grail cup – or vessel – into a stone. It occurred to methat the French poet’s description of the Grail had been sufficiently vague andmystical to allow Wolfram to impose an identity on it, to mould hispredecessor’s rather imprecise concept of a sacred receptacle into a shape thatsuited his own purposes – in short to define that receptacle by speaking notdirectly of it but of its contents.The Ark of the Covenant was, after all, a receptacle too, and it did indeedcontain a stone – or rather two stone tablets upon which the Ten Commandmentshad been inscribed by the finger of God. I therefore found it intriguing thatWolfram’s Grail, like the Tablets of the Law, bore – from time to time – theimprint of a celestial script which set out certain rules.55[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts55]There were other such coincidences – for example, the oracular function that theGrail played for the community that depended on it:We fell on our knees before the Gral, where suddenly we saw it written that aknight would come to us and were he heard to ask a Question there, our sorrowswould be at an end; but that if any child, maiden or man were to forewarn him ofthe Question it would fail in its effect, and the injury would be as it was andgive rise to deeper pain. ‘Have you understood?’ asked the Writing. ‘If youalert him it could prove harmful. If he omits the question on the first evening,its power will pass away. But if he asks his Question in season he shall havethe Kingdom.’56 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts56]The Ark, too, frequently served as an oracle, dispensing advice that was crucialto the survival of the Israelites. In the book of Judges, for example, where theidentity of God Himself was often completely fused with that of the Ark, I foundthis passage:And the children of Israel enquired of the Lord, (for the Ark of the Covenant ofGod was there in those days, and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron,stood before it in those days), saying Shall I yet again go out to battleagainst the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?’ And the Lordsaid, Go up: for tomorrow I will deliver them into thine hand.57[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts57]I also came across a much later biblical passage which stated that it had becomerare for the Ark actually to speak and that ‘visions’ were now ‘uncommon’.Nevertheless, as the prophet Samuel lay down ‘in the house of the Lord, wherethe Ark of God was’, a voice issued forth from the sacred relic warning:‘Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone thatheareth it shall tingle.’58 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts58]Neither were utterances and visions the only ways in which the Ark communicatedits oracular messages. Like the Grail, it also used the written word from timeto time – notably to impart to King David the blueprint for the Temple that hisson Solomon was to build.59 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts59]THE WEIGHT OF SIN, THE GOLDEN CALF, AND STONES FROM HEAVENAs my research progressed I discovered many other shared characteristics linkingthe Grail to the Ark – and particularly to the Tablets of Stone. One exampleconcerned the way in which the weight of the relic seemed to be spirituallycontrolled. According to Wolfram: ‘the Gral [while it may be carried by the pureof heart] is so heavy that sinful mortals could not lift it from its place.’60[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts60]In this, I thought there might well be a connection to an ancient Jewish legendwhich described the moment when the prophet Moses descended from Mount Sinaicarrying the Tablets of Stone, then freshly inscribed with the divine words ofthe Ten Commandments. As he came into camp the prophet caught the children ofIsrael in the act of worshipping the golden calf, a sin so unspeakable that:All at once he saw the writing vanish from the tablets, and at the same timebecame aware of their enormous weight; for while the celestial writing was uponthem they carried their own weight and did not burden Moses, but with thedisappearance of the writing all this changed.61[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts61]In Wolfram’s cryptic prose the golden calf, too, made an appearance. It did so,moreover, in a context so crucial that I felt certain that the author was usingit quite deliberately to convey a message – a message further identifying theGrail with the Ark:There was a heathen named Flegetanis [I read in Chapter 9 of Parzival] who washighly renowned for his acquirements. This same physicus was descended fromSolomon, begotten of Israelitish kin all the way down from ancient times … Hewrote of the marvels of the Gral. Flegetanis, who worshipped a calf as though itwere his god, was a heathen by his father … [and] was able to define for us therecession of each planet and its return, and how long each revolves in its orbitbefore it stands at its mark again. All human kind are affected by therevolutions of the planets. With his own eyes the heathen Flegetanis saw – andhe spoke of it reverentially – hidden secrets in the constellations. He declaredthere was a thing called the Gral, whose name he read in the stars without moreado. ‘A troop [of Angels] left it on earth and then rose high above the stars,as if their innocence drew them back again.’62[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts62]To my mind what was really important about this passage was the way in which itused Flegetanis (with his intriguingly Solomonic and Jewish/pagan background) tosignal an astral origin for the Grail.Why important? Simply because some of the most serious biblical scholarship thatI studied argued that the Tablets of Stone contained within the Ark of theCovenant had, in reality, been two pieces of a meteorite.63[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts63] Neither was this merely somelatter-day interpretation that could not have been shared by Moses and by theLevitical priests who attended the Ark. On the contrary, since ancient times,Semitic tribes such as the children of Israel had been known to venerate stonesthat ‘fell from heaven’.64 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts64]The best illustration of this custom, since it had continued into modern times,was the special reverence accorded by Muslims to the sacred Black Stone builtinto a corner of the wall of the Ka’aba in Mecca. Kissed by every pilgrim makingthe Haj to the holy site, this stone was declared by the Prophet Muhammad tohave fallen from heaven to earth where it was first given to Adam to absorb hissins after his expulsion from the Garden of Eden; later it was presented by theangel Gabriel to Abraham, the Hebrew Patriarch; finally it became thecornerstone of the Ka’aba – the ‘beating heart’ of the Islamic world.65[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts65]Geologists, I learned, unhesitatingly attributed a meteoric origin to the BlackStone.66 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts66] Likewise the pairs ofsacred stones, known as betyls, that some pre-Islamic Arab tribes carried ontheir desert wanderings were believed to have been aerolites – and it wasrecognized that a direct line of cultural transmission linked these betyls(which were often placed in portable shrines) with the Black Stone of the Ka’abaand with the stone Tablets of the Law contained within the Ark.67[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts67]I then discovered that betyls had been known in medieval Europe as lapis betilis– a name:stemming from Semitic origins and taken over at a late date by the Greeks andRomans for sacred stones that were assumed to possess a divine life, stones witha soul [that were used] for divers superstitions, for magic and forfortunetelling. They were meteoric stones fallen from the sky.68[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts68]In such a context, I found it hard to believe that Wolfram had merely beenindulging in flights of fancy when he had specified a meteoric origin for hisGrail-Stone. Not only did he use his character Flegetanis to this end but also,a few pages further on, he provided a strange alternative name for the Grail –‘Lapsit exillis’.69 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts69] Although Icame across a variety of interpretations for the real meaning of thispseudo-Latin epithet,70 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts70] the mostplausible by far was that it had been derived from lapis ex caelis (‘stone fromheaven’), lapsit ex caelis (‘it fell from heaven’), or even lapis, lapsus excaelis, ‘stone fallen from heaven’.71[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts71] At the same time it seemed to methat the bastardized words Lapsit exillis were quite close enough to lapisbetilis to raise the suspicion that the German poet had intended a deliberate –and characteristically cryptic – pun.BENEDICTIONS, SUPERNATURAL LIGHT, AND THE POWER OF CHOICEAnother and quite different area of comparison lay in Wolfram’s repeateddescriptions of the Grail as a source of blessing and fertility for thosepure-hearted people who came into contact with it. To cite one example amongstmany,72 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts72] I found this passage inChapter 5 of Parzival:Whatever one stretched out one’s hand for in the presence of the Gral, it waswaiting, one found it all ready and to hand – dishes warm, dishes cold,new-fangled dishes and old favourites … for the Gral was the very fruit ofbliss, a cornucopia of the sweets of this world.73[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts73]It seemed to me quite probable that this description echoed an ancient Talmudiccommentary which had it that:When Solomon brought the Ark into the Temple, all the golden trees that were inthe Temple were filled with moisture and produced abundant fruit, to the greatprofit and enjoyment of the priestly guild.74[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts74]I found an even closer correspondence between the Ark and the Grail in theotherworldly luminescence said to have been given off by both objects. The Holyof Holies in Solomon’s Temple (where the Ark was installed before itmysteriously vanished) was a place of ‘thick darkness’ according to the Bible.75[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts75] Talmudic sources recorded,however, that: ‘The High Priest of Israel entered and left by the light that theHoly Ark issued forth’ – a convenient state of affairs that changed after therelic disappeared. From then on the Priest ‘groped his way in the dark’.76[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts76]The Ark, therefore, was a source of paranormal lambency: a dazzling radiance wasemitted by it – as numerous biblical passages confirmed.77[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts77] In similar fashion Chrétien’sGrail, which I thought that Wolfram had been happy to accept (because itprovided the receptacle part of the Ark cipher that he then completed with hisStone), sent out a radiance ‘so great … that … candles lost their brilliancejust as the stars do at the rising of the sun or moon.’78[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts78]Chrétien’s Grail was likewise made of ‘pure gold’79[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts79] while the Ark was ‘overlaid withpure gold, within and without’80 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts80]and was covered with a lid (known as the ‘mercy seat’) which was also ‘of puregold’.81 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts81] But it was not from thisprecious metal that Ark and Grail derived their light-generating quality; ratherthis was the product of their shared impregnation with a fiery celestial energy.And it was this same energy (cast forth by the Tablets of Stone after the TenCommandments had been inscribed upon them by the finger of God) that causedMoses’ face to shine with an eerie, supernatural brilliance when he descendedfrom Mount Sinai:As he came down from the mountain, Moses had the two Tablets of the Testimony inhis hands. He did not know that the skin on his face was radiant … And whenAaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, the skin on his face shone so muchthat they would not venture near him.82[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts82]I therefore thought it not entirely coincidental that Wolfram’s Grail-Stone, onits very first appearance in Parzival, was carried in procession in the hands ofa certain Repanse de Schoye whose face ‘shed such refulgence that all imaginedit was sunrise.’83 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts83]THE HEAVEN-DESTINED HERORepanse de Schoye was a ‘Princess’84[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts84] and was also ‘of perfectchastity’.85 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts85] Her most importantcharacteristic, however, was that the Grail had chosen her: ‘She whom the Gralsuffered to carry itself’, Wolfram explained, ‘had the name Repanse deSchoye … By her alone, no other I am told, did the Gral let itself becarried.’86 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts86]Such phrases seemed to imply that the relic possessed a kind of sentience. Andlinked to this was another quality: ‘No man can win the Gral,’ Wolfram stated inChapter 9 of Parzival, ‘other than one who is acknowledged in Heaven as destinedfor it.’87 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts87] The same point wasthen forcefully reiterated in Chapter 15: ‘No man could ever win the Gral byforce, except the one who is summoned there by God.’88[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts88]These two notions – of the Grail exercising powers of choice and of it being aprize to be won only by those who were ‘Heaven-destined’ – were of greatimportance in Wolfram’s overall scheme of things. I concluded, moreover, thatprecedents were provided for both of them in biblical descriptions of the Ark ofthe Covenant. In Numbers 10:33, for instance, it chose the route that thechildren of Israel were to take through the desert, and it also determined wherethey should camp. Meanwhile in the book of Chronicles there was this example ofcertain individuals being ‘Heaven-destined’ for the Ark:None ought to carry the Ark of God but the Levites; for them hath the Lordchosen to carry the Ark of God and to minister unto it.89[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts89]It was not in the Bible, however, that I found the closest correspondencesbetween the Ark of the Covenant and Wolfram’s sentient, Heaven-destined Grail.These came rather in the Kebra Nagast, which told the story of the Ark’sabduction to Ethiopia. In Sir E. A. Wallis Budge’s authoritative Englishtranslation90 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts90] I came across thispassage in which the sacred relic was referred to almost as though it were afeminine person (who, like all ladies, could change her mind):And as for what thou sayest concerning the going of the Ark of the Covenant totheir city, to the country of Ethiopia, if God willed it and she herself willedit, there is no one who could prevent her; for of her own will she went and ofher own will she will return if God pleaseth.91[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts91]Next I noted the following strange references which seemed to imply that therelic possessed intelligence and also that the honour of keeping it was grantedas a result of heavenly predestination:The Ark goeth of its own free will whithersoever it wisheth, and it cannot beremoved from its seat if it does not desire it.92[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts92]Without the Will of God the Ark of God will not dwell in any place.93[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts93]But the chosen ones of the Lord are the people of Ethiopia. For there is thehabitation of God, the heavenly ZION,94[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts94] the Ark of His Covenant.95[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts95]Last but not least, in Chapter 60 of the Kebra Nagast, I found a lengthylamentation supposedly uttered by Solomon when he learned that the Ark had beenabducted by his son Menelik from the Holy of Holies of the Temple in Jerusalem.At the moment of his bitterest grief an angel appeared to him and asked:‘Why art thou thus sorrowful? For this hath happened by the Will of God. The Arkhath … been given … to thy first-born son …’ And the King was comforted by thisword, and he said, ‘The will of God be done and not the will of man.’96[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts96]Could this not be, I wondered, exactly what had been in Wolfram’s mind when hehad written that ‘no man could ever win the Gral by force except the one who issummoned there by God’? In other words, if the Grail was indeed a cryptogram forthe Ark then might not the prototype for the German poet’s ‘Heaven-destined’hero have been none other than Menelik himself?To answer this question I read Parzival again. I was not looking, however, forliterary influences from the Kebra Nagast – as Helen Adolf had done – but ratherfor the presence of explicit clues embedded within the text which pointed in thedirection of Ethiopia. I wanted to know whether there was there anything at allto suggest that Ethiopia might in fact be Wolfram’s mysterious TerreSalvaesche97 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts97] – the land of theGrail and, therefore, by implication, the land of the Ark."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4A MAP TO HIDDEN TREASUREMy readings of Parzival during the spring and summer of 1989 had brought astartling possibility to my attention: the fictional object known as the HolyGrail could have been devised to serve as a complex symbol for the Ark of theCovenant. This in turn had led me to formulate another hypothesis – namely thatbehind Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Heaven-destined Grail hero, there might lieanother figure who, once recognized, would point the way to the heart of themystery of the whereabouts of the Ark – a figure whose real identity the poethad therefore disguised beneath layers of arcane and sometimes deliberatelymisleading details. This figure, I suspected, might be none other than Menelik I– the son of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon who, according to Abyssinianlegends, had brought the Ark of the Covenant to Ethiopia. If there was anythingat all to this speculation, I reasoned, then I might hope to find further cluesembedded in Parzival – cryptic clues that might be obscured by frequent falsetrails, that might be scattered here and there amongst widely separatedchapters, that might be calculatedly vague and ambiguous, but that would,nevertheless, serve to reinforce the Ethiopian connection if only they could begathered together and made sense of.EBONY AND IVORYI found the first of these clues early in the text of Parzival in a chapterwhich spoke of a far-off land called ‘Zazamanc’ where the people ‘were all asdark as night’.1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts1] To this land camea wandering European aristocrat, ‘Gahmuret of Anjou’,2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts2] and there he fell in love with nolesser personage than the queen – ‘sweet and constant Belacane’.3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts3]In ‘Belacane’ I could not help but hear an echo of ‘Makeda’, the Ethiopian namefor the Queen of Sheba that I had first become acquainted with when I hadvisited Axum in 1983. I was also aware that this same monarch had been known inMuslim tradition as Bilquis.4 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts4]Since I was by this time quite familiar with Wolfram’s love of neologisms, andwith his tendency to make up new and fanciful names by running old onestogether, it seemed to me rash totally to reject the possibility that ‘Belacane’might be a kind of composite of ‘Bilquis’ and ‘Makeda’ – and doubly rash sincethe poet described her as a ‘dusky queen’.5[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts5]When I looked more closely at the love affair between Belacane and Gahmuret,recounted at length in the first chapter of Parzival, I found further echoes ofthe King Solomon and Queen of Sheba story told in the Kebra Nagast and also,with minor variations, in a range of other Ethiopian legends. In this connectionI felt it was not accidental that Wolfram had gone to considerable lengths tomake it clear that Gahmuret – like Solomon – was white, while Belacane, likeMakeda, was black.For example, after the arrival of the ‘fair complexioned’ Angevin knight6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts6] in Zazamanc, Belacane observed toher hand-maidens: ‘His skin is a different colour from ours. I only hope this isno sore point with him?’7 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts7]Certainly it was not, because her romance with Gahmuret blossomed in thefollowing weeks, one thing led to another, and eventually the couple retired toher bedroom in the palace:The Queen disarmed him with her own dark hands. There was a magnificent bed witha sable coverlet, where a new though private honour awaited him. They were nowalone: the young ladies-in-waiting had left the room and closed the doors behindthem. The Queen yielded to sweet and noble love with Gahmuret, her heart’s owndarling, little though their skins matched in colour.8[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts8]The lovers married. Because Belacane was an unbaptized heathen, however, andGahmuret a Christian with many deeds of chivalry still to do, he fled Zazamancwhen she was ‘twelve weeks gone with child’9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts9] and left her only this letter:‘Like a thief I have sailed away. I had to steal away to spare our tears. Madam,I cannot conceal it that did you but live within my rite I would long for you toall eternity. Even now my passion gives me endless torment! If our child has theaspect of a man, I swear he will be brave.’10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts10]Long after his departure Gahmuret continued to suffer agonies of remorse since‘the dusky lady was dearer to him than life’.11[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts11] Later he proclaimed:‘Now many an ignorant fellow may think that it was her black skin I ran awayfrom, but in my eyes she was as bright as the sun! The thought of her womanlyexcellence afflicts me, for if noblesse were a shield she would be itscentre-piece.’12 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts12]So much then for Belacane and Gahmuret. But what of their child?When her time came the lady was delivered of a son. His skin was pied. It hadpleased God to make a marvel of him, for he was both black and white. The Queenfell to kissing his white spots, time and time again. The name she gave herlittle boy was Feirefiz the Angevin. When he grew up he cleared whole forests –so many lances did he shatter, punching holes in shields. His hair and all hisskin were particoloured like a magpie.13[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts13]Wolfram could hardly have found a more graphic way to emphasize that Feirefizwas a half-caste – the product of a union between a black woman and a white man.This half-caste Feirefiz, furthermore, was to go on to play a crucial role inthe story of Parzival. His father, the amorous Gahmuret, returned to Europeafter deserting Belacane and there married another queen, a certain Herzeloyde,whom he immediately set about making pregnant. He then abandoned her also, wentoff to have several more adventures, earned great honour in a series of battles,and eventually managed to get himself killed. ‘A fortnight later,’ Wolframrelated, Herzeloyde ‘was delivered of a babe, a son so big in the bone that shescarce survived.’14 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts14] That son wasParzival himself, the eponymous hero of Wolfram’s tale and – through Gahmuret –the half-brother of Feirefiz.15 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts15]In the Kebra Nagast and other relevant Ethiopian legends there were, Idiscovered, numerous parallels to the complex of relationships involvingGahmuret, Belacane, Feirefiz, Parzival et al. These parallels were often of anindirect kind; nevertheless I had come to expect such tantalizing hints fromWolfram and I became increasingly confident that he was laying down a trail ofclues that – through snares and mazes – would lead me to Ethiopia in the end.The constant references to the contrasting blackness and whiteness of Belacaneand Gahmuret had been unmissable features of the opening sections of Parzival.In the Kebra Nagast the lovers were King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. LikeGahmuret and Belacane they had retired to bed together.16[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts16] Like Gahmuret and Belacane, oneof them (in this case Makeda) had deserted the other and gone on a longjourney.17 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts17] Like Gahmuret andBelacane the fruit of their union had been a half-caste son, in this caseMenelik.18 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts18] And again likeGahmuret and Belacane, the difference in their colour was repeatedly emphasizedin the relevant text, in this case the Kebra Nagast. In a typical scene theJewish monarch was upbraided for Menelik’s abduction of the Ark in the followingunambiguous terms:Thy son hath carried away the Ark of the Covenant,19[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts19] thy son whom thou hast begotten,who springeth from an alien people into which God hath not commanded you tomarry, that is to say from an Ethiopian woman, who is not of thy colour, and isnot akin to thy country, and who is, moreover, black.20[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts20]There were, in addition, certain parallels between Menelik and Feirefiz whichwent beyond their shared identity as half-castes. Amongst these, for example,was the curiosity of the very name ‘Feirefiz’. What language did it belong to,and what – if anything – did it mean? I checked and discovered that literarycritics had quite firm ideas on this subject. Most interpreted thestrange-sounding epithet as a characteristic Wolfram neologism based on theFrench words ‘vair fils’ meaning, literally, ‘piebald son’.21[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts21] Another school of thought,however, derived it equally plausibly from ‘vrai fils’ – ‘true son’.22[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts22]In the Kebra Nagast itself I could find no comparison directly reflecting eitheretymology (although, in Chapter 36, Solomon declared, on first being introducedto Menelik: ‘Look ye, this is my son’23[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts23]). In a somewhat different butequally ancient Ethiopic recension of the same legend, however (translated intoEnglish in 1904 by Professor Erno Littman of Princeton University), the momentof the meeting between Solomon and Menelik was also described, and containedthis passage:At once Menelik went to him and took his hand to greet him. Then said Solomon:‘Thou art my true son’.24 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts24]‘Vrai fils’, in other words!DEVIOUS MECHANISMSCoincidences like these made it increasingly difficult for me to resist thenotion that Wolfram had indeed linked his Feirefiz with Menelik. Why should hehave done that? Not, I speculated, because he had been influenced by the KebraNagast (as the scholar Helen Adolf had suggested in the 1940s25[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts25]) but rather because he had knownthe final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant to be in Ethiopia, andbecause he had set out to encode this knowledge within the story of Parzival –which was thus a kind of literary ‘treasure map’ that used the Grail as acryptogram for the Ark itself.Wolfram had been addicted to ingenious tricks – to a species of verballegerdemain that was as baffling as it was entertaining. I felt, however, that Iwas beginning to see through most of his illusions and also to recognize thedecoys that he so frequently set up in order to lure his readers away from thesecret that lay hidden at the heart of his story. I was therefore undisturbed bythe fact that it was not Feirefiz himself who was depicted as being on a questfor the Grail – nor Feirefiz who was eventually accorded the honour of findingthe precious relic. Such an outcome would have provided much too direct andobvious a pointer. And, besides, Wolfram could not have afforded to allow theheathen half-caste son of a black queen to become the hero of a romance writtenfor the amusement of medieval European Christians.For these reasons, it seemed to me that the clever German poet had been quitecontent to let all-white, all-good Parzival win through to the non-existentGrail – which was the only thing that most of his audience would be interestedin. Meanwhile, for the discerning few, it would be Feirefiz – the true son – whowould point the way to the Ark.I realized, however, that I needed something more solid to support thishypothesis than just a series of coincidences – no matter how suggestive andintriguing these coincidences might seem. I therefore set about thebrain-bending task of combing through Parzival yet again.Eventually I found what I was looking for. I remembered from my previousreadings that Feirefiz had ended up marrying Repanse de Schoye26[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts26] – the pure and perfectGrail-bearer who, surrounded by an aura of sanctity and power, had appeared anddisappeared constantly throughout the story. Now I came across a small buthighly significant detail contained in a single line that I had missed before:according to Wolfram’s ‘happily-ever-after’ conclusion, the son of Feirefiz andRepanse de Schoye had been named ‘Prester John’.27[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts27]It was obvious to me at once that this could be a momentous clue. I knew thatthe first Europeans to arrive in Ethiopia had addressed the monarchs of thatcountry as ‘Prester John’.28 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts28] Ialso knew that the legendary founder of the self-styled ‘Solomonic’ dynasty towhich those monarchs had belonged had been Menelik I – the supposed son ofSolomon and the Queen of Sheba. I therefore could not help but be excited toread that Repanse de Schoye had given Feirefiz ‘a son named “John” ’ and,moreover, that ‘They called him “Prester John”, and, ever since, they call theirkings by no other name.’29 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts29]It would have been very nice if I had been able, there and then, to demonstratethat the land of the Grail – Terre Salvaesche – was in fact the same as the landruled by ‘Prester John’. Such a direct linkage would, at the very least, haveenormously strengthened what I was coming to think of as my ‘treasure map’theory of Wolfram’s work. Unfortunately, however, there was not a single shredof evidence in Parzival to support this view: the location of Terre Salvaeschewas never spelled out in anything other than the most dreamlike and indefiniteterms and at no point was it suggested that its king was ‘Prester John’.I was about to conclude that I had marched optimistically into an extremelydepressing cul de sac when I discovered that there was another medieval Germanepic in which Prester John did become the guardian of the Grail. Called DerJüngerer Titurel (‘The Younger Titurel’), it was written in a style so close tothat of Parzival that scholars had long attributed it to Wolfram himself (thisattribution dated back to the thirteenth century).30[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts30] Relatively recently, however, thehand of a slightly later author had been detected. Thought to have been acertain Albrecht von Scharfenberg, this author was believed to have compiled‘The Younger Titurel’ between 1270 and 1275 (about fifty years after Wolfram’sdeath) and to have based it on previously uncirculated fragments of Wolfram’sown work.31 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts31] Indeed Albrecht’sidentification with ‘his master’32[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts32] had been so complete that he hadactually claimed to be Wolfram, ‘adopting not just his name and subject matterbut also his mannerisms as a narrator and even the details of his personalhistory.’33 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts33]I knew that there was a well established tradition in medieval literature oflater writers extending and completing the work of their predecessors. Wolfram’sParzival had itself grown out of Chrétien de Troyes’s original story of the HolyGrail. Now it seemed that it had been left to a third poet, Albrecht, to providean ending to that story – an ending in which the Grail found its last restingplace.This last resting place, as ‘The Younger Titurel’ stated clearly, was the landof Prester John.34 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts34] I thought ithighly significant that such a statement existed in the literature of the Grailand, moreover, that it had been made by a Wolfram acolyte who appeared to havehad privileged access to the notes and jottings of Wolfram himself. This, in myopinion, was just the sort of devious mechanism that ‘the master’ might have setup in order not to have to spell out his Ethiopian secret too bluntly inParzival – while at the same time ensuring that that secret would be transmittedto future generations.Perhaps this conclusion was warranted; perhaps it was not. Its significance,however, lay less in its academic merits than in the fact that it encouraged meto take Wolfram’s own brief mention of ‘Prester John’ seriously – and thus topersevere with what turned out to be an exhausting but ultimately fruitfulinvestigation.The purpose of that investigation was to find the answer to a single question:when Wolfram talked of ‘Prester John’ could he have had an Ethiopian monarch inmind?The first indications were that he had not; indeed he stated plainly that‘Prester John’s’ birth had taken place in ‘India’35[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts35] – a country of which Feirefiz wasapparently the king and to which he and Repanse de Schoye had returned after theadventures described in Parzival were over.To complicate the picture further the same paragraph then went on to advise that‘India’ was also known as ‘Tribalibot’ (‘Here we call it “India”: there it is“Tribalibot” ’36 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts36]). Checking backI found earlier passages in which Feirefiz had been spoken of as the ‘Lord ofTribalibot’37 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts37] – which wasconsistent enough since I now knew that his son ‘Prester John’ had ultimatelysucceeded him as the ruler of Tribalibot/India. However, I could hardly forgetthat Feirefiz was himself the son of Belacane the Queen of ‘Zazamanc’. I wastherefore not surprised to learn that Wolfram had also referred to Feirefiz asthe ‘King of Zazamanc’.38 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts38]The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from this confetti of exotic titlesand appellations was that ‘Zazamanc’, ‘Tribalibot’ and ‘India’ were all, infact, the same place. But could this place possibly be Ethiopia? Wasn’t it muchmore reasonable to assume – since he had actually named it – that Wolfram hadhad the subcontinent of India in mind all along?I decided to research the real, historical pedigree of ‘Prester John’ to see ifthis would shed any more light on the problem.A REAL KINGThe name ‘Prester John’, I discovered, had been completely unknown before thetwelfth century – a century during which European Crusaders had occupied theHoly City of Jerusalem for a continuous period of more than eighty years (theywere finally expelled by the Saracens in 1187). Historians agreed that the veryfirst mention of Prester John had been made roughly half-way through this period– in 1145 in the Chronicle of Bishop Otto of Freisingen. Claiming that hisinformant was a Syrian churchman, the bishop had written of a certain ‘John,king and priest [rex et sacerdos]’, a Christian who lived in ‘the uttermostEast’ where he commanded enormous armies which, apparently, he wished to put atthe disposal of the defenders of Jerusalem. This ‘Prester John – for so he waswont to be styled’ was said to be so rich that he used a sceptre of solidemerald.39 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts39]Subsequently, in 1165, a letter purporting to have been written by Prester Johnhimself and addressed to ‘various Christian kings, especially to the EmperorManuel of Constantinople and the Roman Emperor Frederick’,40[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts40] was circulated widely in Europe.Filled with the most preposterous, legendary and supernatural claims, thislengthy epistle stated, inter alia, that the Prester’s realm was divided intofour parts ‘for there are so many Indias’.41[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts41]The next development came in 1177 when Pope Alexander III (writing from Venice)addressed a letter to his ‘dearest son in Christ, John, illustrious andmagnificent King of the Indians’.42[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts42] Although the Pope certainlybelieved that he was replying to the author of the 1165 letter he made it clearthat he had also had information about ‘the Prester’ from another source. Hespoke, for example, of his personal physician, ‘the leech Philip’, who hadapparently been approached in Jerusalem by the Prester’s emissaries.Significantly these emissaries, who were referred to as ‘honourable persons ofthe monarch’s kingdom’, had expressed their ruler’s desire to be grantedsomething that had not even been mentioned in the 1165 letter – a sanctuary inthe Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.43[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts43] Responding to this request, thePope commented:The more nobly and magnanimously thou conductest thyself, and the less thouvauntest of thy wealth and power, the more readily shall we regard thy wish asto the concession of [an altar] in the Church of the Lord’s Sepulchre atJerusalem.44 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts44]There was much that was puzzling in these twelfth-century documents. But the onething that was clear from all of them was that Prester John, in his earliestincarnations, had been explicitly associated with ‘India’. As I looked moredeeply into the whole issue I was able to confirm that this was indeed the case:again and again ‘the Prester’s’ realms were referred to as India or, moreloosely, ‘the Indies’.It was quite obvious, however, that none of the medieval authorities concernedhad had any firm idea in their own minds as to where exactly India and/or theIndies were. And it was equally obvious, when they talked about ‘India’, thatthey were only rarely speaking of the subcontinent itself. The majority of thereferences were quite clearly to some other place, perhaps in Africa, perhapselsewhere – although nobody really seemed to know.As I researched the subject further I began to understand what the source of allthis uncertainty might have been: for more than a thousand years before theearliest mention of Prester John a profound terminological muddle had existed inwhich ‘India’ had frequently been confused with ‘Ethiopia’. Indeed from thefirst century BC (when Virgil had written of the Nile rising in ‘India’), untilat least the time of Marco Polo – when all the countries that bordered on theIndian Ocean were still referred to as ‘the Indies’45[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts45] – the terms ‘Ethiopia’ and‘India’ appeared to have been used as though they were completelyinterchangeable.The classic example of this lay in the works of Rufinius, the fourth-centuryByzantine theologian who had compiled the definitive account of Ethiopia’sconversion to Christianity that I had studied in 1983.46[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts46] The details of this importanttreatise (which included place names such as Axum and historically recognizedfigures such as Frumentius and King Ezana) confirmed beyond all doubt that thecountry Rufinius had talked about had indeed been Ethiopia; nevertheless he hadreferred to it throughout as ‘India’.47[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts47]This had happened, as one historian explained, because ‘the early geographershad always regarded Ethiopia as the western part of the great empire ofIndia’.48 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts48] Moreover, it seemedthat this same geographical mistake, coupled with the curious letters that hadcirculated in the twelfth century, had helped to create the impression thatPrester John was an Asiatic, indeed an Indian, king.This impression, though erroneous, had proved so tenacious that it was still inevidence long after ‘the Prester’ had ceased to be a mythical figure – and longafter his realms had been firmly located in the Horn of Africa. In the latethirteenth century, for example, Marco Polo provided some insight into theconventional wisdom of his era when he wrote that ‘Abyssinia is a large provinceand is called middle or second India. The ruler of this country is aChristian.’49 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts49] Similarly, in thefourteenth century, the Florentine traveller Simone Sigoli was still speaking of‘Presto Giovanni’ as a monarch dwelling in India; this ‘India’, however, was aland which bordered on the dominions of the Sultan of Egypt and its king wasdescribed as being the ‘master of the Nile’, the flow of which into Egypt he wasbelieved to be able to control.50 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts50]Rather later, when the first official Portuguese embassy was sent to Ethiopia inthe sixteenth century, its members believed that they were going to meet ‘thePrester John of the Indies’. The authorised account of this mission wassubsequently written by Father Francisco Alvarez, who disembarked at the Red Seaport of Massawa in April 1520 and then spent the next six years travellingoverland around Ethiopia. Despite this arduous physical tour of what wasunmistakably part of the African mainland, the title of his work continued toreflect the old terminological confusion: ‘Verdadera Informacam das terras doPreste Joam das Indias’ (‘Truthful information about the countries of thePrester John of the Indies’).51 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts51]Throughout his scholarly and informative book, Alvarez always referred to theEmperor of Ethiopia as ‘the Prester’ or as ‘Prester John’.52[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts52] I was also able to establish thatmuch earlier than this – in 1352 – the Franciscan Giovanni de Marignolli,apostolic legate in Asia, had spoken (in his Chronica) of ‘Ethiopia where thenegroes are and which is called the land of Prester John’.53[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts53] Similarly in 1328 a certain FriarJordanus ‘Catalani’ had referred to the Emperor of the Ethiopiansi ‘quem vosvocatis Prestre Johan’.54 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts54] And,later, in 1459, Fra Mauro’s well regarded map of the then known world indicateda great city within the boundaries of present-day Ethiopia with the rubric: ‘Quiil Preste Janni fa residentia principal.’55[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts55]Surveying all the conflicting references before me I felt literally dazed:sometimes, it seemed, Prester John had been unambiguously located in Ethiopia;on other occasions he had been located in Ethiopia but spoken of as the ruler ofthe ‘Indies’; and sometimes he had been located in India itself – or elsewherein the far east. Behind all this confusion, however, there seemed to be no doubtthat the real Prester John, the source of all the myth-making, must all alonghave been the ruler of Ethiopia – the only non-European Christian kingdom thathad existed anywhere in the world in medieval times, and therefore the onlymodel that Wolfram could possibly have drawn on when he had talked of an ‘India’being ruled by ‘Prester John’, the Christian son of Fierfiz and Rapanse deSchoye.For a final and hopefully definitive word I turned to the EncyclopaediaBritannica, which observed:It is not improbable that from a very early date the title ‘Prester John’ wasassigned to the Abyssinian king, though for a time this identification wasovershadowed by the prevalence of the Asiatic legend. At the bottom of thedouble allocation there was, no doubt, that confusion of Ethiopia with Indiawhich is as old as Virgil or perhaps older.56[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts56]Significantly for my purposes, the Encyclopaedia concluded its entry with areference to the exchange of letters between the Pope and Prester John that, asnoted earlier, had taken place in the second half of the twelfth century:However vague may have been the ideas of Pope Alexander III respecting thegeographical position of the potentate whom he addressed from Venice in 1177,the only real person to whom the letter can have been sent was the king ofAbyssinia. Let it be observed that the ‘honourable persons of the monarch’skingdom’ whom the leech Philip had met with in the East must have been therepresentatives of some real power, and not of a phantom. It must have been areal king who professed to desire … the assignation of … an altar at Jerusalem.Moreover we know that the Ethiopic Church did long possess a chapel and altar inthe Church of the Holy Sepulchre.57[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts57]Indeed so. In fact, as I was soon able to ascertain, the chapel and the altarhad first been granted to Ethiopia in the year 1189 – and not by the Pope (whoby then was no longer in a position to distribute such favours) but by theMuslim general Saladin who had wrested Jerusalem from the hands of the Crusadersin 1187. Most important of all, these special privileges in the Holy Sepulchrehad been obtained for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church as a result of a directappeal to Saladin by no lesser person than the King of Ethiopia himself.58[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts58]These events had taken place just a decade before unknown stonemasons innorthern France had left enigmatic representations of the Holy Grail, of the Arkof the Covenant, and of an Ethiopian Queen of Sheba in the north porch ofChartres cathedral – and also just a decade before Wolfram von Eschenbach hadbegun to write his Parzival. It seemed to me, moreover, that such coincidenceswere unlikely to be just coincidences. On the contrary, I now felt that thecircumstantial evidence very strongly supported my hypothesis that the Chartressculptures and Wolfram’s remarkable narrative poem had been explicitly createdto serve as esoteric treasure maps. And, though not actually marked with an ‘X’,there seemed to be little doubt that the spot identified by these maps as thehiding place of the treasure could only be Ethiopia – the land of Prester John,the land that had provided the last resting place of the fictional Holy Grail,and thus (if my theory was correct) the land in which the Ark of the Covenant,the real object that the Grail symbolized, would be found.Now, however, other questions presented themselves:• How, in the late twelfth century, could information that the Ark might rest inEthiopia possibly have reached a German poet and a group of Frenchiconographers?• What connected the former to the latter? – for they must have been connectedin some way if they had both produced works of art encoding the same message.• Finally, why should anyone have chosen to express the secret of the Ark’slocation in a story and in sculptures? I had already concluded that this mighthave been done to ensure transmission of the secret to future generations. Atthe same time, however, the code used – particularly by Wolfram – had beenexceptionally difficult to crack. I myself, with all the research resources ofthe twentieth century at my disposal, had only got as far as I had because I hadbeen to Axum and had thus been predisposed to accept that the Ark might be inEthiopia. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, however, that advantageshould not have been available to anyone. From this it followed that the hiddenmessage of Parzival could not have been decoded in the medieval period at all –unless there had been people with access to some very special and privilegedknowledge. Since there would have been no point in creating a code that no onecould crack, it seemed to me logical to assume that such people must haveexisted. But who could they have been?I did find one group of Europeans who fitted the bill perfectly. As part of theCrusading army of occupation they had maintained a massive presence in Jerusalemin the twelfth century: they had been there in 1145 when the Prester Johnlegends had first begun to circulate, and they had still been there in 1177 whenenvoys of the King of Ethiopia had visited the Holy City seeking an altar in theChurch of the Holy Sepulchre. Direct contact between Ethiopians and members ofthis European group would therefore have been perfectly possible.The group in question was, moreover, highly secretive and made regular use ofcodes and ciphers in its far-flung international communications. It was, inaddition, a group that had been involved with the evolution and dissemination ofGothic architecture in Europe (and quite specifically with the architecture andiconography of Chartres cathedral). Finally, and most importantly, it was agroup that Wolfram von Eschenbach had several times mentioned by name – a namethat I had also come across in connection with the curious Grail cup that thesculptors of the north porch of Chartres cathedral had placed in the left handof their imposing statue of the priest-king Melchizedek59[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts59] (which, incidentally, was almostthe only depiction of Melchizedek in the whole of medieval Europe60[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts60]).What then was the name of this strangely influential, powerful and widelytravelled group?Its full and formal title was the ‘Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple ofSolomon’61 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts61] – but its members werebetter known simply as ‘Templars’, or as Knights Templar. It was, fundamentally,a religious order, an order of warrior monks, and throughout much of the twelfthcentury it had its headquarters in Jerusalem on the site of Solomon’s Temple –the same site from which the Ark of the Covenant had inexplicably vanished inOld Testament times.

In anauthoritative study of the Grail legend (which she undertook on behalf of theJung Foundation) she argued that something of great significance must have lainbehind this abrupt and dramatic materialization. Indeed she went so far as tosuggest that in Chretien de Troyes’s Conte du Graal and Wolfram’s Parzival – thefirst two exemplars of the genre – it was almost ‘as if a subterraneanwatercourse had been tapped’.1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts1]What might that ‘subterranean watercourse’ have been?The answer, I thought, lay in the period of history in which the Grail romancesbegan to circulate. This, after all, was the era of the Crusades – an era thathad brought Europeans into close contact with Arab and Judaic culture for thefirst time and that saw the occupation of Jerusalem by Christian armies foreighty-eight years (from AD 1099 until the recapture of the Holy City by Saladinin 1187). It was in 1182 – the eighty-third year of the occupation – thatChrétien produced his version of the Grail story. And shortly after the fall ofJerusalem Wolfram von Eschenbach started work on his own Parzival.I therefore found it difficult to resist the conclusion that these earlyrecensions of the Grail romance must have been based on something that hadhappened – or on material that had come to light – during the period thatJerusalem had been under the full control of European forces. I looked verycarefully at the text of Parzival to see whether there was any evidence tosupport this conjecture and discovered that Wolfram had on several occasionsmade mention of a mysterious source named ‘Kyot’ – a man, he said, whom he hadrelied upon heavily for his information and who fortunately had been:a baptized Christian – otherwise this tale would still be unknown. No infidelart would avail us to reveal the nature of the Gral and how one came to know itssecrets.2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts2]This was by no means the only place in Parzival where the German poet had hintedthat there might have been more to his Grail than at first met the eye. I wasalready satisfied that this ‘something more’ could well have been the Ark of theCovenant – the real object that lay behind the beautiful fictional symbol. Nowas I studied the widely scattered references to ‘Kyot’ it occurred to me thatthis shadowy figure, whose identity was never clarified, could have been thesource who had introduced Wolfram to the secret of the Ark’s hiding place inEthiopia. Referred to at one point as ‘Kyot, who sent us the authentic tale’,3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts3] he was clearly very important. Butwho was he?There were few obvious clues in Parzival itself. Here Kyot was spoken of as a‘Master’4 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts4] and there it wassuggested that his mother tongue had been French.5[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts5] But beyond such hints there wasvery little to go on. I therefore turned to the literary scholars and found thatseveral of them had identified Kyot quite specifically with a twelfth-centuryFrench poet, Guyot de Provins, who had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem shortlybefore the recapture of the Holy City by the Saracens6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts6] – and who had also been attachedfor a while to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts7]This latter fact caught my eye because I knew that Frederick – like Wolfram –had been a German by birth (before his election as Emperor in 1152 he had beenDuke of Swabia8 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts8]). And I also knew(see previous chapter) that this same Frederick had been one of the two monarchsspecifically named amongst the various Christian kings to whom the ‘letter ofPrester John’ had been addressed in the year 1165.Investigating further I then learned something else – something that turned outto be of major importance: Guyot/Kyot had been closely associated with theKnights Templar9 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts9] who, according toEmma Jung’s study, ‘were considered to be the guardians of Solomon’s Temple’.10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts10] I also knew that it was fromSolomon’s Temple that the Ark of the Covenant had mysteriously disappeared inOld Testament times. I was therefore excited to discover that, in Parzival,Wolfram had described the guardians of the Grail as ‘Templars’11[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts11] and had referred to them,flatteringly, as:a noble Brotherhood … who, by force of arms, have warded off men from everyland, with the result that the Gral has been revealed only to those who havebeen summoned to Munsalvaesche to join the Gral Company.12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts12]Were Wolfram’s ‘Templars’ the same as the famous military order of that name?I found that the word translated into English as ‘Templars’ had, in the MiddleHigh German of Parzival, been Templeis.13[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts13] Amongst the scholars there wassome debate about what exactly had been meant by this. The consensus, however,was that the term was ‘an obvious variant of the regular forms templarius,templier, Eng. Templar’14 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts14] andthat Wolfram’s ‘Order of Knighthood dedicated to the service of the Gral’ couldtherefore be ‘identified with the order of the Knights Templar’.15[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts15]I then remembered that one of the guidebooks I had used on my visit to Chartrescathedral had spoken of ‘Wolfram von Eschenbach, who is said to have been aTemplar – though there is no proof of this’.16[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts16] On further investigation I wasable to establish that there had indeed been persistent rumours to thiseffect.17 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts17] I also learned thatseveral well respected scholars had suggested that the German poet might himselfhave paid a visit to the Holy Land whilst writing Parzival.18[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts18]DIGGING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE?I had been intrigued by Emma Jung’s assertion that the Templars in Wolfram’stime ‘were considered to be the guardians of Solomon’s Temple’. I had notunderstood why this should have been so. However, when I began to research theorder, I discovered that it had derived its official title (‘The Poor Knights ofChrist and of the Temple of Solomon’) from the fact that its Jerusalemheadquarters had been located on the summit of Mount Moriah – where Solomon’sTemple had stood until its destruction by the Babylonians in 587 BC. That Templehad been built in the tenth century BC and its explicit – indeed its only –purpose had been to serve, as the Bible put it, as ‘an house of rest for the Arkof the Covenant of the Lord’.19 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts19]By identifying themselves with Solomon’s Temple, therefore, it seemed to me thatthere was a very real sense in which the knights had also identified themselveswith the Ark of the Covenant. And my feeling that this was so strengthened as Ibegan to investigate the curious history of the order.The Templars, I learned, had been founded by nine French noblemen who had madetheir way to the Holy Land in AD 1119 – twenty years after Jerusalem had beencaptured and occupied by the European powers. The twelfth-century historian,Archbishop William of Tyre, noted that ‘foremost and most distinguished’ amongstthese nine men ‘were the venerable Hugh de Payens and Godfrey de St Omer.’20[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts20]On checking further I discovered something interesting. Hugh de Payens, who wasin fact the first Grand Master of the Order,21[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts21] had been born in the village ofPayens, eight miles north of the city of Troyes in the old French county ofChampagne.22 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts22] Moreover it seemedthat the nine founders were all from the same region.23[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts23] In this there were severalcoincidences:1 Chartres, with its great cathedral, had – in both the twelfth and thirteenthcenturies – been a dominion of the Counts of Champagne.24[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts24]2 One of the original nine knights, André de Montbard (who later became thefifth Grand Master), was an uncle of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux25[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts25] – who was himself a native ofChampagne. This enormously influential cleric had taken a special interest bothin Gothic architecture and in the Grail romances.26[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts26]3 The city of Troyes, so close to the birthplace of Hugh de Payens, the firstTemplar Grand Master, was also the home of Chrétien de Troyes, the ‘inventor’ ofthe Holy Grail.4 Hugh de Payens was a cousin of the Count of Champagne,27[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts27] and, in the year 1125, the Countof Champagne joined the Templars.28[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts28]5 When Chrétien de Troyes rose to prominence rather later in the twelfth centuryhis principal patron was the Countess of Champagne.29[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts29]Noting this string of coincidences with some interest, I went on to learn moreabout the early history of the Templars.There was much that was strange. Perhaps strangest of all, however, was the wayin which the nine original knights were received by King Baldwin I of Jerusalemin 1119. As soon as they had arrived in the Holy City they told him that theywanted to establish their headquarters on the Temple Mount30[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts30] – where the monarch had recentlyconverted the Al-Aqsa Mosque to serve as his own royal palace. Ratherastonishingly he complied at once with their request, giving them, for theirexclusive use, a large part of the former mosque and its outbuildingsimmediately adjacent to the famous ‘Dome of the Rock’, which marked the sitewhere Solomon’s Temple had once stood.31[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts31]Thereafter, like latter-day archaeologists with an important dig to complete,the knights lived, ate, slept and worked on this uniquely precious site: indeedfor almost seven years after their arrival they rarely left it and adamantlyrefused admission to any outside party. In public pronouncements they haddeclared that their mission in the Holy Land was to ‘to keep the road from thecoast to Jerusalem free from bandits’.32[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts32] I could find no evidence,however, to suggest that they took any steps to fulfil this mission during thosefirst seven years of their existence; on the contrary, as one authority put it,‘the new Order apparently did very little’ in this period.33[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts33] Besides, simple logic suggestedthat nine men could hardly have protected anybody on a highway almost fiftymiles long – and their number stayed at nine until they were joined by the Countof Champagne in 1125. Moreover, the members of an older and far larger militaryorder – the Knights of Saint John – were already doing the job of protectingpilgrims when the Templars arrived.34[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts34]I could only conclude, therefore, that Hugh de Payens and his colleagues musthave had some other, undeclared, purpose. As noted above, they largely confinedthemselves to the precincts of the Temple Mount during the first seven years oftheir sojourn in Jerusalem – and this suggested very strongly that their realmotive must have had to do with that very special site.From the beginning their behaviour was secretive and I found, as a result, thatthere was no really hard evidence about what they had been up to there. Itseemed at least possible, however, that they might have been looking forsomething, and this suspicion deepened when I learned that they had indeed usedtheir occupancy of the Temple Mount to conduct quite extensive excavations.Because the Temple Mount today contains the third and fourth most sacred sitesof Islam – the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque – modern archaeologistshave never been permitted to work there. In recent years, however, Israeli teamshave operated freely immediately to the south of the Mount, and there they foundthe exit-point of a tunnel which they identified as having being dug by theTemplars in the twelfth century.35[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts35] In their official report thearchaeologists stated:The tunnel leads inward for a distance of about thirty metres from the southernwall before being blocked by pieces of stone and debris. We know that itcontinues further, but we had made it a hard-and-fast rule not to excavatewithin the bounds of the Temple Mount, which is currently under Moslemjurisdiction, without first acquiring the permission of the appropriate Moslemauthorities. In this case they permitted us only to measure and photograph theexposed section of the tunnel, not to conduct an excavation of any kind. Uponconcluding this work … we sealed up the tunnel’s exit with stones.36[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts36]And that was all that was known, or could be said, about the Templar tunnel. Thearchaeologists had only been able to confirm that it continued further than theythemselves had been allowed to go. Extending inwards from the southern wall,however, I realized that it might well have penetrated into the very heart ofthe sacred precincts, quite possibly passing directly beneath the Dome of theRock a hundred or so metres to the north of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.The Dome of the Rock, I discovered, was so named because within it lay a hugestone, known to the Jews as the Shetiyyah (literally the ‘Foundation’). When theTemple of Solomon had been erected on this exact spot in the mid-900s BC, theArk of the Covenant had been placed on the Shetiyyah, which had formed the floorof the Holy of Holies.37 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts37] Then, in587 BC, the Temple had been destroyed by the Babylonians and most of thepopulation of Jerusalem had been carried off into exile. There was no evidence,however, to suggest that the conquerors had also carried off the Ark; on thecontrary, it appeared to have vanished into thin air.38[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts38]Subsequently a legend began to circulate which provided a possible explanationfor what had happened – an explanation that was accepted by most Jews. Accordingto this legend, only moments before the Babylonian looters had burst into theHoly of Holies, the sacred relic had been hidden away in a sealed and secretcavern directly beneath the Shetiyyah.39[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts39]Expressed as it was in a variety of Talmudic and Midrashic scrolls, and in thepopular apocalypse known as the ‘Vision of Baruch’40[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts40] – all of which were still verymuch in circulation in Jerusalem in the twelfth century AD – it occurred to methat the Templars might easily have learned the details of this intriguinglegend. Moreover, with a little further research, I was able to establish thatthey could well have done so some years before 1119 – the date of their officialarrival in Jerusalem. Hugh de Payens, the founder of the order, had made apilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1104 in the company of the Count of Champagne.41[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts41] The two men had then returned toFrance and were known to have been together there in 1113.42[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts42] Three years later Hugh went backto the Holy Land alone43 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts43] and thenreturned once more – this time to gather together the eight knights whotravelled with him in 1119 and who formed the nucleus of the Templar order.The more I thought about this sequence of events the more likely it seemed to methat Hugh and the Count of Champagne could, on their 1104 pilgrimage, have heardof the startling possibility that the Ark of the Covenant might lie concealedsomewhere within the Temple Mount. If so, I speculated, then was it not alsoprobable that they could have formulated a plan to try to recover the sacredrelic? And did this not explain the determined manner in which the nine knightshad taken control of the Temple Mount in 1119 – and also the many othercuriosities of their behaviour in the early years of the order’s existence?I found tangential support for this conjecture in Emma Jung’s authoritativestudy of the Grail legend. There, in an excursus, the psychoanalyst argued thatthe European occupation of Jerusalem in the twelfth century had been inspired,at least in part, by a belief that some puissant, sacred and incalculablyprecious relic lay concealed in that city. As she commented:This deeply-rooted concept of hidden treasure contributed to the fact that thesummons to liberate the Holy Sepulchre awakened a resounding echo [and] imparted[an] inflammatory motive power to the Crusades – if it did not actually causethem.44 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts44]There could have been no treasure more precious or more sacred than the lost Arkof the Covenant – which, in a century that was unusually obsessed with therecovery of religious relics,45 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts45]could well have looked like the ultimate prize. It therefore seemed to me notjust possible, but actually highly probable, that Hugh de Payens and his backerthe Count of Champagne could indeed have been motivated by a desire to find theArk – and that they could have established the Templars, and taken control ofthe Temple Mount, in order to achieve this goal.If so, however, then they failed in their objective. In the twelfth century, asone expert put it, ‘the asset value of a famous relic was prodigious’.46[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts46] Possession of a relic as uniquelysignificant as the Ark of the Covenant would, in addition, have brought enormouspower and prestige to its owners. From this it followed, that if the Templarshad found the Ark, they would certainly have brought it back to Europe intriumph. Since that had not happened it seemed to me quite safe to conclude thatthey had not found it.Yet rumours persisted that they had found something in their seven years ofintensive digging on the Temple Mount. None of these rumours had any academicauthority whatsoever – but some were intriguing. According to one mystical work,which attempted to address what the Templars had really been up to in Jerusalembetween 1119 and 1126:The real task of the nine knights was to carry out research in the area in orderto obtain certain relics and manuscripts which contained the essence of thesecret traditions of Judaism and ancient Egypt, some of which probably went backto the days of Moses … There is no doubt that [they] fulfilled this particularmission and that the knowledge obtained from their finds was taught in the oraltradition of the Order’s … secret circles.47[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts47]No documentary proof was offered to back up this attractive assertion. In thesame source, however, I was interested to note a name that I had come acrossseveral times before in my research – Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who here wassaid (again without any supporting evidence) to have sent the nine knights toJerusalem.48 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts48]I already knew that Bernard had been the nephew of one of the nine founderknights. I was also aware that he had joined the Cistercian order in 1112, thathe had become an abbot by 111549 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts49]and that he had risen to a position of considerable prominence in Frenchreligious circles by 1119 when the first Templars had arrived in Jerusalem. Itherefore thought that it would be most unwise to dismiss out of hand thepossibility that he might have played some role in the formulation of theirmission. This suspicion intensified considerably when I began to look into whathad happened to the Templars after their first curious seven years.A TRADE-OFF?Late in 1126 Hugh de Payens suddenly left Jerusalem and returned to Europeaccompanied by none other than André de Montbard,50[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts50] the uncle of Saint Bernard. Theknights arrived in France in 1127 and, in January 1128, participated in what wasto be the most significant event in the early history of the Templars. Thatevent was the Synod of Troyes, which had been convened with the explicitobjective of procuring the Church’s official backing for the Templar order.51[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts51]Three things particularly interested me about this important meeting. First, ittook place in the home town of the poet who, some years later, was to invent theHoly Grail; second, it was presided over by Saint Bernard, in his capacity asits secretary;52 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts52] and third,during the course of the Synod, it was Bernard himself who drew up the formalRule of the Knights Templar that, henceforth, was to guide the evolution anddevelopment of the order.53 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts53]If my suspicions were justified, therefore, it seemed that the original nineknights had initially been preoccupied with their excavations on the TempleMount in Jerusalem. Whatever else they might have unearthed there, however, ithad become clear to them by 1126 that they were not going to find the primeobject of their search, the Ark of the Covenant. This realization had made itnecessary for them to consider their future: specifically, having lost theirraison d’être, should they simply cease to exist as an order, or should they tryto forge ahead?History showed that they had indeed suffered a crisis of identity in 1126, thatthey had resolved it and decided to forge ahead, and that they had enlisted thepowerful support of Saint Bernard in this enterprise. At the Synod of Troyes hedrew up their Rule and obtained the full backing of the Church for theirexpansion. And thereafter, in a series of sermons and glowing panegyrics such asDe laude novae militae,54 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts54] hevigorously promoted the young order – thus using his own prestige and influenceto guarantee its success.The results were spectacular. New recruits flocked in from all over France andlater from many other parts of Europe as well. Donations of land and money werereceived from wealthy patrons, and political power quickly followed. By the latetwelfth century the order had become phenomenally rich, was operating asophisticated international banking system,55[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts55] and owned properties throughoutthe known world.And all this, in a sense, it owed to the intervention of Saint Bernard in 1128 –and to his continued solidarity and support in the years that followed. Had heplayed this role on behalf of the Templars purely out of a sense of altruism? Orhad they perhaps given him something in return?Remembering that the 1130s were the decade in which Gothic architecture hadsuddenly and mysteriously burst upon the scene in France, remembering thatBernard had been a prime mover in the dissemination of the Gothic formula, andremembering too the persistent rumours that the Templars had gained access inJerusalem to some deep and ancient source of knowledge, I could not help butwonder if this had been the trade-off. To be sure, the knights had failed tofind the Ark of the Covenant. But what if, in their excavations on the TempleMount, they had unearthed scrolls, manuscripts, theorems or blueprints relatingto Solomon’s Temple itself? What if these discoveries had included the lostarchitectural secrets of geometry, proportion, balance and harmony that had beenknown to the builders of the pyramids and other great monuments of antiquity?And what if the Templars had shared these secrets with Saint Bernard in returnfor his enthusiastic backing for their order?These speculations were not entirely without foundation. On the contrary, one ofthe oddities of the Templars was the fact that they had been great architects.In 1139, Pope Innocent II (whose candidacy, incidentally, had also beenenthusiastically backed by Saint Bernard56[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts56]), granted the order a uniqueprivilege – the right to build their own churches.57[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts57] This was a privilege that theysubsequently exercised to the full: beautiful places of worship, often circularin plan like the Temple Church in London, became a hallmark of Templaractivities.The knights also excelled in military architecture and their castles inPalestine were exceptionally well designed and virtually impregnable. Foremostamongst these imposing fortresses was Adit (Château Pélérin or Castle Pilgrim)which, I discovered, had been built in the year 1218 by the fourteenth GrandMaster of the Templars, William of Chartres58[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts58] – in whose name was revealed yetanother connection to the great Gothic cathedral.Standing to the south of Haifa on a spur of land surrounded on three sides bythe sea, Adit in its heyday was well supplied with orchards, fresh water, andvegetable gardens and even possessed its own harbour and ship-yard together witha jetty two hundred feet long. Often besieged by the Saracens but nevercaptured, it had been capable of sheltering as many as four thousand people. Itsmassive walls, resting on unusually deep foundations, were more than ninety feethigh and sixteen feet thick59 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts59] –and were so well made that large sections of them still survive intact. The sitewas thoroughly excavated by the archaeologist C. N. Johns in 1932. He concludedthat the skills of the Templar architects and masons had been astonishinglyadvanced by comparison with the norm in the Middle Ages and had, indeed, been‘exceptional’ even by modern standards.60[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts60]The Templars also built extensively in Jerusalem where they continued tomaintain their headquarters on the Temple Mount until the Holy City wasrecaptured by the Muslim general Saladin in 1187. I learned that a German monknamed Theoderic had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1174 – at which time hereported that all the buildings within the precincts of the Dome of the Rockwere still ‘in the possession of the Templar soldiers’.61[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts61] He added:They are garrisoned in these and other buildings belonging to them … Below themthey have stables once erected by King Solomon … with vaults, arches, and roofsof many varieties … According to our estimation they will hold ten thousandhorses with grooms.62 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts62]In fact the ‘stables’ had not been erected by King Solomon, but dated back tothe reign of Herod the Great (around the time of Christ). The vaults, arches androofs, however, had been the work of the Templars themselves, who greatlyextended these subterranean halls and who were the first and only people to usethem to accommodate horses.63 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts63]Theoderic’s eyewitness account of the Temple Mount in 1174 continued with thesewords:On the other side of the palace [i.e. the Al-Aqsa Mosque] the Templars havebuilt a new house, whose height, length and breadth, and all its cellars andrefectories, staircase and roof, are far beyond the custom of this land. Indeedits roof is so high that, if I were to mention how high it is, those who listenwould hardly believe me.64 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts64]The ‘new house’ that Theoderic had referred to in 1174 was, unfortunately,knocked down in the 1950s during some renovations undertaken on the Temple Mountby the Muslim authorities. The German monk’s testimony was, however, valuable initself – and what I found most valuable about it was its breathless tone.Clearly he had regarded the Templars’ architectural skills as almostsupernaturally advanced and had been particularly impressed by the soaring roofsand arches that they had built. Reviewing his statements I thought it far fromaccidental that soaring roofs and arches had also been the distinguishingfeatures of the Gothic architectural formula as expressed at Chartres and otherFrench cathedrals in the twelfth century – cathedrals that I knew were regardedby some observers as ‘scientifically … far beyond what can be allowed for in theknowledge of the epoch’.65 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts65]And this brought me back again to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. Looking morethoroughly into what was known about his life and ideas, I was able to confirmmy earlier impression that his influence on the iconography of the Gothiccathedrals had been massive, but indirect, taking the form mainly of groups ofsculptures and of stained-glass windows that had been inspired by his sermonsand writings, often after his death.66[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts66] Indeed, in his lifetime, Bernardhad frequently opposed the unnecessary proliferation of images and had stated:‘There must be no decoration, only proportion.’67[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts67]This emphasis on proportion, harmony and balance in architecture was, I knew,the key to the strange magic of Gothic architecture and, as I became morefamiliar with Saint Bernard’s thinking, I realized that it was in this area thathis influence on the design of Chartres and other cathedrals had been mostprofound. In those great edifices, the introduction of a number of remarkabletechnical innovations like ribbed vaulting, ogive arches and flying buttresseshad enabled the builders to use geometrical perfection to give expression tocomplex religious ideas. Indeed, in a very real sense, it seemed thatarchitecture and faith had merged in twelfth-century Gothic to form a newsynthesis. This synthesis had been summed up by Saint Bernard himself when hehad asked ‘What is God?’ – and had then replied to his own rhetorical questionwith these surprising words: ‘He is length, width, height and depth.’68[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts68]Gothic architecture, as I already knew, had been born at Chartres cathedral withthe start of construction work on the north tower in 1134. This, I now learned,was no accident. In the years immediately prior to 1134 Bernard had cultivated aparticularly close friendship with Geoffrey the Bishop of Chartres,69[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts69] inspiring him with an ‘uncommonenthusiasm’ for the Gothic formula70[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts70] and holding ‘almost dailynegotiations with the builders themselves’.71[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts71]Interesting though it was in itself, the great significance of this piece ofinformation for my purposes lay in the fact that ‘the years immediately prior to1134’ were also the years immediately after the Synod of Troyes, at which SaintBernard had obtained official Church recognition for the Order of the PoorKnights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon. Historians had never been ableto account adequately for the sudden way in which Gothic architecture hademerged in France in the 1130s. But my earlier speculation that the Templarsmight have had a hand in it now looked increasingly plausible. Reviewing all theevidence I had gathered I felt satisfied that they could indeed have unearthedon the Temple Mount some repository of ancient knowledge concerning the scienceof building, and that they could have passed on what they had learned to SaintBernard in return for his support.Moreover Templar interest in the Ark of the Covenant, and the Templarconnections with Wolfram and with Chartres, also rather neatly tied together thetwo cryptic ‘maps’ that I believed I had identified (one carved in stone in thenorth porch of the cathedral, the other encoded in the plot of Parzival). Those‘maps’ had appeared to suggest that Ethiopia was the last resting place of theArk. The question I now needed to address, therefore, was this: how could theTemplars have come to the conclusion that the sacred relic (which they hadfailed to find after seven years of digging in Jerusalem) had in fact beenremoved to Ethiopia? What could have led them to think this way?A possible answer, I discovered, lay in Jerusalem itself – where an exiledEthiopian prince had sojourned for a quarter of a century before returning tohis homeland to claim his kingdom in 1185.72[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts72] Not much more than a decade laterWolfram began to write his Parzival and work started on the north porch ofChartres cathedral.AN ETHIOPIAN PRINCE IN JERUSALEMThe name of the prince who had spent so long in exile in Jerusalem was Lalibela.I became interested in him because of the ‘letter of Prester John’ referred toin the last chapter. That letter had been written in 1165 and I knew that in1177 Pope Alexander III had written a letter of his own to ‘Prester John’ inresponse to a request from ‘the Prester’s’ emissaries for the concession of analtar and a chapel in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Accordingto the Encyclopaedia Britannica, ‘the only real person’ to whom the Pope’sletter could have been sent was the King of Ethiopia.73[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts73] I had therefore naturallywondered which king had sat on the Ethiopian throne in 1177. On researching thematter I had discovered that it had been a man named Harbay and that theconcession requested had not been granted to him but rather to his successor,Lalibela.Neither Harbay nor Lalibela had stemmed from the line of monarchs supposedlydescended from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba through Menelik I. Insteadthey had both belonged to a usurper dynasty known as the Zagwe which had ruledin Ethiopia from roughly ad 1030 until 1270 when the Solomonids were finallyrestored to the throne.74 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts74]This was a period of Ethiopian history about which very little was known. I wasable to confirm, however, that the Solomonic line had been interrupted around AD980 and that this coup d’état had been the work of a tribal chieftainess namedGudit, who adhered to the Jewish faith and who seemed to have been motivatedabove all else by a desire to obliterate the Christian religion. At any rate sheattacked Axum, razed much of the ancient city to the ground, and succeeded inkilling its Solomonic emperor. Two of the royal princes were also murdered but athird escaped with his life and fled to the province of Shoa, far to the south,where he married and produced children, thus ensuring the survival of the olddynasty, although in much reduced circumstances.75[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts75]Gudit was the head of a large tribal confederation known as the Agaw – to whichthe Falashas, the indigenous black Jews of Ethiopia, also belonged.76[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts76] Although it was by no meanscertain that she had left any direct successor, historians accepted that withinfifty years of her death most of northern Ethiopia had been united under theZagwe monarchs who, like her, were all of Agaw extraction.In its early days this dynasty could – again like Gudit – have been Jewish.77[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts77] If so, however (and the case wasnot proved), it had certainly converted to Christianity well before the birth ofPrince Lalibela – which took place in the ancient mountain town of Roha, in whatis now the province of Wollo, around the year 1140.The younger half-brother of King Harbay, Lalibela appeared to have been destinedfor greatness from the moment when his mother saw a dense swarm of beessurrounding him as he lay in his crib. Recalling an old belief that the animalworld could foretell the future of important personages, the legends said thatshe had been seized by the spirit of prophecy and had cried out ‘Lalibela’ –meaning, literally, ‘the bees recognize his sovereignty’.78[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts78]Thus the prince received his name. The prophecy that it expressed caused Harbayto fear for the safety of his throne to such an extent that he tried to haveLalibela murdered while he was still a babe in arms. This first attempt failed,but persecutions of one kind or another continued for several years, culminatingin the administration of a deadly poison that plunged the young prince into acataleptic sleep. Ethiopian legends said that the stupor lasted for three days,during which time Lalibela was transported by angels to the first, second andthird Heavens. There he was addressed directly by the Almighty who told him tohave no anxiety as to his life or future sovereignty. A Purpose had been mappedout for him, for which reason he had been anointed. After awaking from histrance he was to flee Ethiopia and seek refuge in Jerusalem. He could restsecure, however, that when the time was right he would return as king to Roha,his birthplace. Moreover it was his destiny that he would build a number ofwonderful churches there, the like of which the world had never seen before. Godthen gave Lalibela detailed instructions as to the method of construction thatwas to be used, the form that each of the churches was to take, their locationsand even their interior and exterior decorations.79[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts79]Legend and history coincided at this point in a single well documented fact:Lalibela did indeed suffer a long period of exile in Jerusalem while hishalf-brother Harbay continued to occupy the throne of Ethiopia.80[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts80] This exile, I learned, beganaround the year 1160 – when Lalibela would have been about twenty years old –and ended in 1185 when he returned in triumph to his own country, deposed Harbayand proclaimed himself king.81 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts81]From that date onwards there were reliable chronicles of his rule, which lasteduntil AD 1211.82 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts82] He made hiscapital at Roha, where he had been born and which was now renamed ‘Lalibela’ inhis honour.83 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts83] There, perhaps infulfilment of his legendary vision, he almost immediately set about buildingeleven spectacular monolithic churches – churches that were literally carved outof solid volcanic rock (I myself had visited those churches in 1983 some weeksafter my trip to Axum, and had found that they were still places of livingworship).Neither did Lalibela forget his twenty-five-year sojourn in the Holy Land – manyof the features of which he attempted to reproduce in Roha-Lalibela. Forexample, the river running through the town was renamed ‘Jordan’; one of theeleven churches – Beta Golgotha – was specifically designed to symbolize theChurch of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem; and a nearby hill was called DebraZeit (‘Mount of Olives’) so that it might represent the place where Christ wascaptured.84 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts84]Not content with making his capital a kind of ‘New Jerusalem’, the Ethiopianking also sought, throughout his reign, to maintain close links with Jerusalemitself. There was, I discovered, nothing particularly new about this. Since thelate fourth century AD clergy from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church had beenpermanently stationed in the Holy City.85[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts85] It had been a desire to increaseand consolidate this presence that had led to Harbay’s request to Pope AlexanderIII to grant the concession of an altar and a chapel in the Church of the HolySepulchre. Nothing had come of that – other than the Pope’s rather tentativeletter sent in 1177 in reply to Harbay’s initial approach. A decade later,however, there had been two important developments: in 1185 Lalibela had seizedthe Ethiopian throne, and in 1187 Saladin had driven the Crusaders out of theHoly City and had forced Jerusalem’s Ethiopian community, together with otherEastern Christians, to flee to Cyprus.86[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts86]The royal chronicles showed that Lalibela had been deeply disturbed by this turnof events and, in 1189, his envoys had managed to persuade Saladin to allow theEthiopians to return and also to grant them, for the first time, a key site oftheir own – the Chapel of the Invention of the Cross, in the Church of the HolySepulchre.87 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts87] Subsequently, inrelatively modern times, these privileges had again been lost; in consequence, Ilearned, Abyssinian pilgrims were now obliged to make their devotions on theroof of the chapel – where they had established a monastery.88[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts88] They also still possessed twoother churches in Jerusalem as well as a substantial Patriarchate situated inthe heart of the Old City within a few minutes’ walk of the Church of the HolySepulchre.Both in terms of foreign and domestic policy, and also in terms of architecturalexpression and spiritual development, Lalibela’s reign had represented thezenith of the Zagwe dynasty’s powers and achievements. After his death a steepdecline set in. Finally, in AD 1270, his grandson Naakuto Laab was persuaded toabdicate in favour of Yekuno Amlak – a monarch claiming Solomonic descent.89[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts89] Thereafter, until Haile Selassiewas deposed during the communist revolution of 1974, all but one of Ethiopia’semperors had belonged to the royal line that traced its heritage back, throughMenelik I, to King Solomon of Jerusalem.A PATTERN OF COINCIDENCESReviewing what I had learned about Lalibela’s illustrious reign, I realized thatit fitted perfectly into the beguiling pattern of coincidences that I hadalready identified as being associated with the Crusades, with the Templars, andwith the twelfth century:• At the very beginning of the twelfth century (or more properly in 1099, thelast year of the eleventh century) Jerusalem was seized by the Crusaders.• In 1119 the nine founding knights of the Templar order – all French noblemen –arrived in Jerusalem and took up residence on the site of the original Temple ofSolomon.• In 1128 Saint Bernard of Clairvaux won official church recognition for theTemplars at the Synod of Troyes.• In 1134 work started on the north tower of Chartres cathedral, the first-everexample of Gothic architecture.• In 1145 the name ‘Prester John’ was first heard in Europe.• In 1160 Prince Lalibela, the future monarch of Ethiopia, arrived in Jerusalemas a political exile fleeing the persecutions of his half-brother Harbay (whothen occupied the throne).• In 1165 a letter purporting to have been written by ‘Prester John’ and makinga series of awe-inspiring claims about the size of his armies, his wealth andhis power, had been circulated in Europe addressed to ‘various Christian kings’.• In 1177 Pope Alexander III issued a response to the above document but,significantly, made reference in it to another communication that he hadreceived somewhat later – a request from ‘Prester John’ to be granted an altarin the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. It seemed that this requesthad been lodged by ‘the Prester’s’ emissaries who had spoken to the Pope’spersonal physician Philip during a visit that the latter had made to Palestine.(The ‘Prester John’ who had asked for this concession could only have beenLalibela’s half-brother Harbay who, in 1177, was still on the throne ofEthiopia.)• In 1182 the Holy Grail made its first-ever appearance in literature (and, forthat matter, in history) in an uncompleted narrative poem by Chrétien de Troyes.• In 1185 Prince Lalibela left Jerusalem and returned to Ethiopia where hesuccessfully deposed Harbay and seized the throne. Almost immediately thereafterhe began building a group of spectacular rock-hewn churches in his capital Roha– later renamed ‘Lalibela’ in his honour.• In 1187 Jerusalem fell to the Muslim forces of Sultan Saladin and theCrusaders were driven out, along with members of the Ethiopian community in theHoly City – who sought temporary refuge in Cyprus. (Some Templars also went toCyprus – indeed, after the fall of Jerusalem, the knights bought the islandwhich became, for a while, their headquarters.90[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts90])• In 1189 emissaries sent to Saladin by King Lalibela managed to persuade theMuslim general to allow the Ethiopians to return to Jerusalem and also to grantthem a privilege that they had never enjoyed before, the same privilege thatHarbay had sought from the Pope in 1177 – namely a chapel and altar in theChurch of the Holy Sepulchre.• Between the years 1195 and 1200 Wolfram von Eschenbach began to writeParzival, which continued the earlier work done by Chrétien de Troyes and which,in the process, transformed the Grail into a Stone, incorporated many Ethiopicelements into the story, and specifically mentioned not only ‘Prester John’ butalso the Templars.• At exactly the same time work started on the north porch of Chartres cathedralwith its Ethiopic Queen of Sheba, its Grail (containing a Stone), and itsrepresentation of the Ark of the Covenant.The Templars, Gothic architecture, the Holy Grail and the notion that somewherein the world there existed a powerful non-European Christian king called‘Prester John’ had therefore all been the products of the twelfth century. Andin that same century, just before Parzival was written and the north porch ofChartres cathedral built, a future Christian king of Ethiopia – Lalibela – hadreturned to his homeland to claim his throne after spending twenty-five years inJerusalem.It seemed to me, from everything I had learned, that all these matters must havebeen intricately connected by some common factor that had remained hidden fromhistory, perhaps because it had been deliberately concealed. Proof positive of aTemplar quest for the lost Ark of the Covenant, first in Jerusalem and thenlater in Ethiopia, would provide that hidden but common factor – the missinglink in the complex chain of inter-related events, ideas and personalities thatI had identified. I knew, at least for the moment, that I had gone as far as Icould with the part of my investigation that related to Jerusalem. But whatabout Ethiopia? Was there really any evidence at all that the Templars mighthave gone there to look for the Ark – and that they might subsequently havearranged for the results of their quest to be encoded by Wolfram in the arcanesymbolism of his ‘Stone called the Gral’?‘THOSE TREACHEROUS TEMPLARS …’The first breakthrough came when I received an English translation of the fulltext of the letter supposedly written by Prester John himself to variousChristian kings in the year 1165. Unlike Pope Alexander III’s letter to PresterJohn, written in 1177 (which was a genuine document intended, as I now knew, forLalibela’s half-brother Harbay) the 1165 letter was regarded with greatsuspicion by scholars. Its date was authentic, but it was thought most unlikelythat it could have been written by anyone with a real claim to the title‘Prester John’ – and it was therefore regarded as an elaborate hoax.91[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts91]As I read it I could understand why. If the writer was to be believed his‘realms’ contained, amongst other things: ‘wild hares as big as sheep’; ‘birdscalled griffins who can easily carry an ox or a horse into their nest’; ‘hornedmen who have but one eye in front and three or four in the back’; ‘other men whohave hoofed legs like horses’; ‘bowmen who from the waist up are men, but whoselower part is that of a horse’; the fountain of youth; a ‘sandy sea’ from which‘every piece of debris … turns into precious stones’; ‘the tree of life’;‘seven-headed dragons’ – and so on and so forth.92[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts92] Just about every mythical beastand object ever dreamed of, it seemed, was to be found in the land of PresterJohn. Where exactly this land was located, however, was nowhere specified in theletter – except in the loose reference to the ‘many Indias’ quoted in theprevious chapter (a reference, as I now knew, that was more likely to haveapplied to Ethiopia than to the subcontinent). Moreover, scattered here andthere amongst the fabulous creatures were other animals that did seem to belongto the real world: ‘elephants’ and ‘dromedaries’, for example, and also‘unicorns’ with ‘a single horn in front’ which sounded very much likerhinoceroses – all the more so since, apparently, they were sometimes known to‘kill lions’.93 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts93]Such details made me wonder whether the writer of the letter might have beensomething more than a hoaxer – might, in fact, have had direct knowledge ofEthiopia (where, of course, camels, elephants, lions and rhinos were all to befound). My suspicion that this might have been so deepened when I noticed thatmention was also made of ‘King Alexander of Macedonia’ in a context that linkedhim to ‘Gog and Magog’.94 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts94] Thiscaught my eye because I remembered that Alexander, Gog and Magog had beenconnected in an almost identical manner in a very ancient Ethiopic manuscriptknown as the Lefafa Sedek, the ‘Bandlet of Righteousness’,95[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts95] which was supposedly unknownoutside Abyssinia until the nineteenth century.Another point of interest was that ‘Prester John’ claimed in the letter that hisChristian kingdom contained large numbers of Jews – who seemed to besemi-autonomous and with whom wars were often fought. Again this had a certainflavour of genuine Ethiopian conditions: following the tenth-century Jewishuprising by Gudit (which had temporarily overthrown the Solomonic dynasty) therehad in fact been several hundred years of conflict between Ethiopia’s Jews andChristians.96 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts96]All in all, therefore, despite the many fantastic and obviously apocryphalaspects of the letter, I was not disposed to believe that it was entirely animposture. It seemed to me, furthermore, that its prime objective might havebeen to impress and scare the European powers to whom it was addressed. In thisregard I noted in particular the frequent references that it made to the size of‘the Prester’s’ armed forces – for example:We have … forty-two castles, which are the strongest and most beautiful in theworld, and many men to defend them, to wit ten thousand knights, six thousandcrossbowmen, fifteen thousand archers, and forty thousand troopers … Whenever wego to war … know that in front of us there march forty thousand clerics and anequal number of knights. Then come two hundred thousand men on foot, notcounting the wagons with provisions, and the elephants and camels which carryarms and ammunition.97 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts97]This was unmistakably fighting talk, but what was most notable about it was thatit was closely tied to something else – specific, and hostile, mention of theTemplars. In a section apparently intended for the ‘King of France’ the lettersuggested:There are Frenchmen among you, of your lineage and from your retinue, who holdwith the Saracens. You confide in them and trust in them that they should andwill help you, but they are false and treacherous … may you be brave and ofgreat courage and, pray, do not forget to put to death those treacherousTemplars.98 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts98]Reviewing this ominous suggestion in the context of the rest of the bizarreletter I asked myself a question: in the year 1165, which candidate for the roleof ‘Prester John’ could possibly have had a motive (a) to try to frighten offthe European powers in general by boasting of his own overwhelming militarystrength, and (b) to attempt to smear the Knights Templar in particular and torequest that they should be ‘put to death’?The answer I came up with was Harbay, who, in 1165, had been the reigning Zagwemonarch of Ethiopia, and who, as I have already observed, had certainly been theintended recipient of the letter written to Prester John by Pope Alexander IIIin 1177.One of my reasons for pinpointing Harbay as the real author of the supposedlyhoax letter of 1165 was terminological. I had discovered, as my research hadprogressed, that all the Zagwe monarchs had favoured the use of the Ethiopicterm Jan in their string of titles.99[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts99] Derived from Jano, areddish-purple toga worn only by royalty, the word meant ‘King’ or ‘Majesty’ andmight easily have been confused with ‘John’; indeed it could have been preciselybecause of this (coupled with the fact that several of the Zagwe rulers werealso priests) that the phrase ‘Prester John’ had first been coined.But there was a stronger reason to suspect Harbay. He, after all, had been a manwith a burgeoning political problem in the year 1165. By then his disaffectedhalf-brother Lalibela (who was eventually to depose him) had already been inexile in Jerusalem for five years – long enough, I speculated, for him to havegot to know the Templars and to have made friends amongst them. Perhaps he hadeven asked the knights to help him to overthrow Harbay and perhaps Harbay hadgot wind of this plot.Such a scenario, I thought, was not entirely implausible. The slightly laterrequest to the Pope for a concession in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (arequest presented in Palestine by ‘honourable persons’ of ‘Prester John’s’kingdom) suggested that Harbay regularly sent emissaries to Jerusalem; suchemissaries, therefore, could easily have picked up intelligence of a conspiracybrewing between Lalibela and the Templars in 1165. If this had been what hadhappened then it would undoubtedly go a long way to explain the strangelymenacing suggestion to the King of France that it might be a good idea if hewere to have the ‘treacherous Templars’ (still mainly Frenchmen at that time)executed forthwith. The ‘letter of Prester John’ – at least according to thishypothesis – would therefore have been concocted by Harbay’s agents in Jerusalemas a deliberate strategy to deter collusion between the Templars and PrinceLalibela.This was obviously an attractive line of reasoning. It was also dangerouslyspeculative, however, and I would have been reluctant to follow it any furtherif I had not found certain passages in Parzival which seemed to confirm that theTemplars might indeed have entered into precisely the sort of alliance withLalibela that Harbay would have feared.‘DEEP INTO AFRICA …’Written some years after Lalibela had forcefully deposed Harbay from the throneof Ethiopia, Parzival contained a number of direct references to the Templars –who, as I have already noted, were depicted as being members of ‘the GrailCompany’.100 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts100]What I found intriguing was the specific suggestion, which Wolfram repeatedseveral times, that these Templars were occasionally sent on missions overseas –missions that were highly secretive and that were to do with winning politicalpower. For example:Writing was seen on the Gral to the effect that any Templar whom God shouldbestow on a distant people … must forbid them to ask his name or lineage, butmust help them gain their rights. When such a question is put to him the peoplethere cannot keep him any longer.101[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts101]Or similarly:If a land should lose its lord, and its people see the hand of God in it and askfor a new lord from the Gral Company, their prayer is granted … God sends themen out in secret.102 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts102]This was all very interesting, but the passage that really caught my attentioncame one page later in a lengthy monologue by a member of the Grail Company whospoke, amongst other things, of riding ‘deep into Africa … past the Rohas’.103[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts103]Scholars, I discovered, had tentatively identified ‘the Rohas’ with theRohitscher Berg in Saangau Styria.104[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts104] But this derivation lookedcompletely spurious to me: it was not at all suggested by a context that hadjust mentioned Africa and I was quite unconvinced by the reasons given forit.105 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts105] I knew something,however, that the Wolfram specialists in universities in Germany and Englandcould not have been expected to know: Roha was the old name for a town in theremotest highlands of Ethiopia – a town now called Lalibela in honour of thegreat king who was born there and who made it his capital when he returned to itin triumph in the year of our Lord 1185. Neither was there any reason for theexperts in medieval German literature to have been aware that this same Lalibelahad spent the previous quarter of a century in Jerusalem rubbing shoulders withthe knights of a military-religious order whose headquarters stood on the siteof the Temple of Solomon – knights who would have had a special interest in anycontender to the throne of a country which claimed to possess the lost Ark thatthe Temple had originally been built to house. The question that I now needed toaddress, therefore, was this: was there any evidence at all to suggest thatLalibela might have been accompanied by a contingent of Templars when hereturned to Ethiopia in 1185 and deposed Harbay?I did not think that the answer to this question would be easy to find. Luckily,however, I had been to the town of Lalibela in 1983 while working on my book forthe Ethiopian government, and I had kept field notes. I therefore studied thesenotes with great care. To my surprise, I almost immediately came acrosssomething of interest.On the ceiling of the rock-hewn church of Beta Mariam (yet another place ofworship dedicated to Saint Mary the Mother of Christ) I had noticed ‘fadedred-painted crosses of the Crusader type’. I had then remarked: ‘These don’tlook at all like any of the normal Ethiopian crosses – check out origins whenback in Addis.’ I had even made a rough sketch of one of these ‘Crusadercrosses’ (which had triangular arms widening outwards). And, although I couldnot remember doing so, I had obviously followed the matter up to some extent:beneath the sketch and in a different pen I had later added the technical termcroix pattée.What I had not known in 1983 was that the Templars’ emblem – adopted after theSynod of Troyes had given official recognition to the order in 1128 – had been ared croix pattée.106 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts106] I did knowthis in 1989, however. Moreover I also knew that the Templars had beenassociated throughout their history with the construction of wonderful churches.Almost inevitably, further questions began to form in my mind. By a considerablemargin, the eleven rock-hewn churches of Lalibela were the most architecturallyadvanced buildings that Ethiopia had ever known (indeed, in the consideredopinion of UNESCO, they deserved to be ranked amongst the wonders of theworld).107 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts107] Moreover, a certainair of mystery clung to them: there were other rock-hewn churches in thecountry, to be sure, but none were even of a remotely comparable standard.Indeed, in terms of overall conception, of workmanship, and of aestheticexpression, the Lalibela monoliths were unique. No expert had been able tosuggest exactly how they had been built, and there had been persistent rumoursof foreign involvement in their construction. Several academics had speculatedthat Indians, or Egyptian Copts, had been hired as masons by King Lalibela.108[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts108] Ethiopian legends, by contrast,attributed the work to angels! I now had to ask myself, however, whether thetrue artificers of the Lalibela churches might not have been the Templars.Certainly, my 1983 field notes painted a picture of a fantastic architecturalcomplex:Towering edifices [I had written], the churches remain places of living worshipeight hundred years after they were built. It is important to stress, however,that they were not built at all in the conventional sense, but instead wereexcavated and hewn directly out of the solid red volcanic tuff on which theystand. In consequence, they seem superhuman – not only in scale, but also inworkmanship and in conception.Close examination is required before the full extent of the achievement thatthey represent can be appreciated. This is because, like medieval Mysteries,considerable efforts have been made to cloak their real natures: some lie almostcompletely concealed within deep trenches, while others hide in the open mouthsof huge quarried caves. Connecting them all is a complex and bewilderinglabyrinth of tunnels and narrow passageways with offset crypts, grottoes andgalleries – a cool, lichen-enshrouded, subterranean world, shaded and damp,silent but for the faint echoes of distant footfalls as priests and deacons goabout their timeless business.Four of the churches are completely free-standing, being attached to thesurrounding rock only by their bases. Although their individual dimensions andconfigurations are very different, they all take the form of great hills ofstone, precisely sculptured to resemble normal buildings. They are whollyisolated within the deep courtyards excavated around them and the most strikingof them is Beta Giorghis (the Church of Saint George). It rests in majesticisolation at a considerable distance from all the others. Standing more thanforty feet high in the centre of a deep, almost well-like pit, it has been hewnboth externally and internally to resemble a cross. Inside there is a faultlessdome over the sanctuary and, throughout, the craftsmanship is superb.I concluded my 1983 notes – from which I have copied only the brief extractabove – with the following question:Setting aside the assistance supposedly provided by angels, how exactly wereLalibela’s wonders created? Today, if truth be told, no one really knows: thetechniques that made possible the excavation and chiselling of stone on sodramatic a scale, and with such perfection, have long been lost in the mists ofhistory.In the summer of 1989, looking back at what I had written six years previously,I was uncomfortably aware of how little those mists had cleared – and of howmuch there remained for me to find out. Intuitively I had a strong feeling thatthe Templars could have been involved in the creation of the Lalibela complex.The fact was, however, that there was really nothing to support this view otherthan the red ‘Crusader crosses’ that I had observed painted on the ceiling ofSaint Mary’s (one of the four completely free-standing churches).Nevertheless there was a genuine mystery surrounding the origin of the churches.This mystery was reflected in the inability of scholars to explain how they hadbeen excavated or who their architects could have been. It also found an echo inthe quaint insistence of some of the inhabitants of Lalibela that angels hadbeen involved in the work. Now, as I studied my 1983 field notes I discoveredthat there were other dimensions to the enigma.Inside Saint Mary’s, I had recorded, a priest had taken me close to the veiledentrance of the Holy of Holies and there had pointed out a tall pillar. I haddescribed this pillar in the following terms:About as thick as a good-sized tree-trunk, it soars upwards out of the rockfloor and disappears into the gloom above. It is completely wrapped,spiral-fashion, in a very old, discoloured shroud of cloth that bears fainttraces of washed-out dyes. The priest says that the pillar is sacred and thatengraved upon it are certain writings by King Lalibela himself. Apparently thesewritings tell the secrets of how the rock-hewn churches were made. I asked ifthe cloth could be drawn back so that I could read these secrets, but the poorpriest was horrified. ‘That would be sacrilege,’ he told me, ‘the covering isnever removed.’Gallingly, my notes had nothing else to add on this point. I had gone on toscribble my little entry on the ‘Crusader crosses’ and then had left SaintMary’s for the next church in the complex.Closing the battered foolscap jotter that had travelled everywhere with me in1983, I felt what I can only describe as a sense of retrospective fury at myearlier lack of curiosity. There had been so much in Lalibela that I had failedto investigate. There had been so many questions that I should have asked andhad failed to ask. Golden opportunities had thrown themselves wantonly at mefrom every direction and I had ignored them.Rather wearily I turned my attention to the hefty stack of primary and secondaryreference materials that I had accumulated on Ethiopia. The bulk of what I hadconsisted of photocopies of worthy but irrelevant academic papers. There was,however, one book which looked rather promising. Entitled The Prester John ofthe Indies, it was an English translation of the narrative of the Portugueseembassy to Ethiopia in 1520–6. Written by Father Francisco Alvarez, thisnarrative – running to more than five hundred pages – had first been printed inLisbon in 1540 and had been rendered into English in 1881 by the ninth BaronStanley of Alderley.It was Lord Stanley’s translation that I had before me – in a relatively newedition issued by the Hakluyt Society in 1961. The editors, Professors C. F.Beckingham and G. W. B. Huntingford of the University of London, describedAlvarez as ‘rarely silly or incredible … a kind, tactful, sensible man … freefrom the dishonesty of the traveller who tries to exaggerate his own knowledge.’As a result his book was universally regarded by scholars as being ‘of greatinterest … incomparably detailed [and] a very important source for Ethiopianhistory.’109 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts109]With this glowing testimonial fresh in my mind I turned to page 205 of Volume I,where Alvarez began his account of his own visit to Lalibela. A lengthychurch-by-church description followed which I could only admire for itsexhaustive detail and for its plain, no-nonsense language. What I found moststriking of all was how little things seemed to have changed in the four and ahalf centuries that had elapsed between Alvarez’s visit and my own. Even thecovering on the pillar in Saint Mary’s had been there! After giving an accountof other aspects of that church the Portuguese traveller had added: ‘It hadbesides a high column in the cross of the transept over which is fixed a canopy,the tracery of which looks as if it had been stamped in wax.’110[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts110]Referring to the fact that all the churches were ‘entirely excavated in theliving rock, very well hewn’ Alvarez exclaimed at one point:I weary of writing more about these buildings, because it seems to me that Ishall not be believed if I write more, and because regarding what I have alreadywritten they may blame me for untruth. Therefore I swear by God, in whose powerI am, that all I have written is the truth, to which nothing has been added, andthere is much more than what I have written, and I have left it that they maynot tax me with its being falsehood, so great was my desire to make known thissplendour to the world.111 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts111]Like the good reporter he undoubtedly was, Alvarez talked to some of the seniorpriests at the end of his visit – a visit, it is worth remembering, that wasmade only three and a half centuries after the churches were built. Amazed byeverything he had seen, the Portuguese cleric asked his informants if they knewhow long the carving and excavation of the monoliths had taken and who hadcarried out the work. The reply he was given, unencumbered by latersuperstitions, caused my pulse to race:They told me that all the work on these churches was done in twenty-four years,and that this is written, and that they were made by white men … They say thatKing Lalibela ordered this to be done.112[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts112]Coming at the end of everything else I had learned, I felt that I could notdisregard this pure and early piece of testimony. To be sure, the history bookson my shelves made no mention of any ‘white men’ going to Ethiopia before thetime of Alvarez himself. That, however, did not rule out the possibility thatwhite men had gone – white men who had belonged to a military-religious orderthat was renowned for its international outreach and for its secretiveness;white men who, in the words of Wolfram von Eschenbach, were ‘forever averse toquestioning’;113 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts113] white men whowere sometimes sent to ‘distant people … to … help them gain their rights’;114[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts114] white men whose headquarters inthe twelfth century had stood over the foundations of the Temple of Solomon inJerusalem.The priests’ strange statement about the ‘white men’ who had come to Lalibelatherefore struck me as being a matter of the utmost importance. Above all else,it strengthened my conviction that Wolfram had been indulging in something morethan mere whimsy when, in Parsival, he had linked the Templars so closely to hisGrail cryptogram and to Ethiopia. He had never, anyway, been a whimsical writer;on the contrary he had been pragmatic, clever and highly focussed. I thus nowfelt increasingly confident that my suspicions about him were justified and thathe had indeed been admitted to the inner circles of a great and terrible mystery– the secret of the last resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. Perhapsthrough the good offices of his ‘source’, the Templar acolyte Guyot de Provins,or perhaps by means of a more direct contact, he had been commissioned by theorder to encrypt that secret in a compelling story that would go on being toldand retold for centuries.Why should the Templars have wanted Wolfram to do such a thing? I could think ofat least one possible answer. Written down and placed in some form of container(a chest buried in the ground for example), the secret of the Ark’s whereaboutsmight easily have been lost or forgotten within a century or so, and would thenonly have come to light if somebody physically dug it up again. Cleverly encodedin a popular vehicle such as Parzival, however (which, I discovered, had beentranslated into almost all modern languages and reprinted in English five timesin the 1980s in the Penguin Classics edition alone), the same secret would havestood an excellent chance of being preserved indefinitely in world culture. Inthis way, through all the passing centuries, it would have continued to beavailable to those with the capacity to decipher Wolfram’s code. It would, inshort, have been hidden in full view, enjoyed by all as a ‘cracking good yarn’,but accessible only to a few – initiates, insiders, determined seekers – as thetreasure map that it really was.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_016_r1.jpg]This photograph of the ceiling of the rock-hewn church of Saint Mary’s wasprovided to me by my Canadian publisher John Pearce in November 1991 – shortlybefore this book went to press. Pearce took it on a visit that he made toLalibela in 1982. On the arch can be seen a stylised croix pattée containedwithin a Star of David – a most unusual symbol in a Christian place of worship,but one to which it is known that the Knights Templar were particularlyattached.

As explained in Chapter 5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c05_r1.htm], I did notfind it difficult to see how and why they might have been motivated to do that.But what I now needed to establish was this: other than the Templar ‘quest’ thatI thought I had identified, was there really any convincing evidence to suggestthat the last resting place of the Ark of the Covenant might actually be in thesanctuary chapel at Axum?After all, there were literally hundreds of cities and churches around the worldwhich boasted of possessing holy relics of one kind or another – fragments ofthe True Cross, Christ’s shroud, the finger-bone of Saint Sebastian, the lanceof Longinus, and so on and so forth. In almost every case where a properinvestigation had been conducted such boasts had turned out to be hollow. Why,therefore, should Axum be any different? The fact that its citizens obviouslybelieved their own legends certainly didn’t prove anything – except, perhaps,that they were a susceptible and superstitious lot.And, on the face of things, there seemed to be several good reasons forconcluding that the Ethiopians did not possess the Ark of the Covenant.TROUBLE WITH TABOTSFirst and foremost, in the mid-nineteenth century, a legate of the ArmenianPatriarch had visited Axum determined to prove that the tradition of the Ark’spresence there, ‘which the whole of Abyssinia believed to be the truth’, was infact ‘an appalling lie’.1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts1] Afterputting some pressure on the Axumite priests, the legate – whose name wasDimotheos – had been shown a slab of ‘reddish-coloured marble, twenty-fourcentimetres long, twenty-two centimetres wide and only three centimetres thick’2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts2] which the priests had said was oneof the two tablets of stone contained within the Ark. They had not shown him theobject believed by Ethiopians to be the Ark itself and had clearly hoped that hewould be satisfied with a glimpse of the tablet – which they had referred to as‘the Tabot of Moses’.3 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts3]Dimotheos had indeed been satisfied. He reported with the obvious pleasure of aman who has just debunked a great myth:The stone was virtually intact, and showed no sign of age. At the most it datedfrom the thirteenth or fourteenth century of the present era … Stupid peoplelike the Abyssinians who blindly accept this stone as the original are baskingin a useless glory by possessing it, [for it is] not the true original at all.Those that know the Holy Scriptures do not require any further proof of this:the fact is that the tablets on which the divine laws were inscribed were placedinside the Ark of the Covenant and lost forever.4[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts4]What was I to make of this? If the slab of stone shown to the Armenian legatehad really come from the relic claimed by the Axumites to be the Ark of theCovenant then he was right to suggest that they were basking in useless glory,because it went without saying that something made in ‘the thirteenth orfourteenth century of the present era’ could not possibly have been one of thetwo ‘tablets of the law’ on which the Ten Commandments had supposedly beeninscribed more than twelve hundred years before the birth of Christ. In otherwords, if the contents were bogus then it followed that the container must bebogus too, which meant that the entire Axumite tradition was indeed ‘anappalling lie’.But that was a conclusion, I felt, that it would be premature to accept beforeattempting to find the answer to an important question: had Dimotheos been shownthe object believed to be the genuine Tabot of Moses, or had he in fact beenshown something else?This question was particularly pertinent because the Armenian legate had soobviously been affronted and outraged by the possibility that a people as‘stupid’ as the Ethiopians might possess a relic as precious as the Ark of theCovenant – and had therefore very much wanted to prove that they did not.Moreover, as I read and re-read his account, it became apparent to me that hisdesire to vindicate his own prejudices had over-ridden any proper investigativespirit on his part – and that he had also absolutely failed to recognize thesubtle and devious nature of the Ethiopian character.When he had visited Axum in the 1860s the specially dedicated sanctuary chapelhad not yet been built5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts5] and theArk – or the object believed to be the Ark – was still kept in the Holy ofHolies of the church of Saint Mary of Zion (where, in the seventeenth century,it had been installed by Emperor Fasilidas after the reconstruction of thatgreat edifice6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts6]). Dimotheos,however, had not been permitted to enter the Holy of Holies. Instead he had beentaken to a rickety wooden outbuilding ‘situated with some other rooms outsidethe church on the left’.7 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts7] It hadbeen in this outbuilding that the ‘reddish-coloured marble stone’ had beenrevealed to him.8 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts8]Because of this it seemed to me that there was a very high degree of probabilitythat the Armenian legate had been duped by the priests. The Ark, I knew, wasregarded as uniquely sacred by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. It was thereforeinconceivable that it, or any part of its contents, would have been removed eventemporarily from the Holy of Holies of Saint Mary of Zion unless there had beensome extremely compelling reason. The voyeuristic whim of a vulgar foreignerwould certainly not have qualified as such a reason. At the same time, however,this foreigner had been an emissary of the Armenian Patriarch in Jerusalem andit would therefore have been thought wise to treat him with a certain amount ofrespect. What to do? The answer, I suspected, was that the priests had decidedto show him one of the many tabots kept at Axum. And because he had soforcefully expressed his wish to see something connected to the Ark, if not theArk itself, it would only have been kindly and polite to massage his ears withwords that he obviously very much wanted to hear, namely that what he was beingshown was the ‘original Tabot of Moses’.Needing to be sure that I was right about this I made a long-distance telephonecall to Addis Ababa, where Professor Richard Pankhurst – my co-author on thegovernment book in 1983 – was now living (he had moved back to the city in 1987to take up his old post at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies). After tellinghim a little about my re-awakened interest in the Axumite tradition concerningthe Ark of the Covenant, I asked him about the Dimotheos incident. Did he thinkthat the Tabot that the Armenian legate had been shown could actually have beenone of the objects believed by Ethiopians to have been placed in the Ark byMoses?‘Most unlikely,’ Richard replied. ‘They wouldn’t show such a sacred thing to anyoutsider. Besides, I’ve read Dimotheos’s book and it’s full of mistakes andmisapprehensions. He was a pompous man, pretty unscrupulous in his dealings withthe Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and not entirely honest. I imagine the Axumclergy would have seen through him very quickly and fobbed him off with someother tabot that wasn’t of any great importance to them.’We talked for some time longer and Richard supplied me with the names andtelephone numbers of two Ethiopian scholars who he thought might be able to helpme with my research – Dr Belai Gedai (who had spent several years making anexhaustive study of his country’s ancient history, drawing heavily on rareAmharic and Ge’ez documents) and Dr Sergew Hable-Selassie of the Institute ofEthiopian Studies, the author of a highly respected work entitled Ancient andMedieval Ethiopian History to 12709[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts9] with which I was already familiar.The question of what Dimotheos had or had not seen in Axum was still very muchat the forefront of my mind and I decided that I would put the problem toHable-Selassie. I therefore called him, introduced myself, and asked for hisopinion on the matter.He laughed: ‘Well certainly that fellow did not see the original Tabot of Moses.To satisfy his wish the priests showed him a substitute – not the realone … Here in Ethiopia it is normal for each church to have more than one tabot.In fact some have as many as ten or twelve, which they use for differentceremonial purposes. So he would have been shown one of these. There’s no doubtabout that at all.’The confident nature of the historian’s response laid to rest any remaininguncertainty that I may have felt about the merits of the Armenian legate’stestimony. The ‘reddish-coloured marble stone’ that he had seen had no value asevidence either for or against Ethiopia’s claim to possess the Ark of theCovenant. Nevertheless his account of his visit to Axum had raised anothercomplicated reservation in my mind – a reservation to do with the whole issue oftabots as a category of sacred objects. As far as I was aware these objects weresupposed to be replicas of the Ark of the Covenant – which, as I knew very well,had been a box about the size of a tea-chest. Yet the small marble slab thatDimotheos had been shown had been called a tabot and it had been described asone of the tablets of stone contained inside the Ark.This was something that I really needed to clarify. Every Ethiopian church hadits own tabot (and, as I now knew, they sometimes had several). But were thesetabots really supposed to be replicas of the sacred object, thought to be theArk, that was kept in the sanctuary chapel in Axum? If that were the case, andif all tabots were flat slabs, then the implication was that that sacred object,too, must be a flat slab – which meant that it could not be the Ark (although itmight possibly be one of the tablets of the law on which the Ten Commandmentshad been inscribed).Certainly the tabots that I had seen over my many years of acquaintance withEthiopia had all been slabs rather than boxes – slabs that had been madesometimes of wood, and sometimes of stone. And certainly, also, it had been thisvery characteristic that had led the scholar Helen Adolf to conclude thatWolfram von Eschenbach must have had some knowledge of tabots when he haddevised his Grail Stone.10 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts10]That was all very well – if tabots were meant to represent the stone tabletsthat the Ark had contained. On the other hand, if these objects were thought ofas replicas of the Ark itself then the Axumite claim to that relic would beseverely damaged. I could hardly forget that it had been precisely this problem– brought starkly to my attention after my visit to the British MuseumEthnographic Store in 1983 – that had caused me to abandon my initial researchinto the great mystery that was now clamouring for my attention once again.Before going any further, therefore, I felt that it was imperative to establishonce and for all exactly what tabots were supposed to be. To this end Itelephoned Dr Belai Gedai, the other Ethiopian scholar whom Richard Pankhursthad recommended to me. After introducing myself I got straight to the point: ‘Doyou believe,’ I asked, ‘that the Ark of the Covenant is in Ethiopia?’‘Yes,’ he replied emphatically. ‘Not only me but all Ethiopians believe that theArk of the Covenant is in Ethiopia, kept in the church of Saint Mary of Zion inAxum. It was brought here after the visit of Emperor Menelik I to his fatherSolomon in Jerusalem.’‘And what about the Ethiopian word tabot? Does that mean “Ark”? Are tabotssupposed to be replicas of the Ark in Axum?’‘In our language the correct plural of tabot is tabotat. And, yes, they arereplicas. Because there is only one original Ark and because the ordinary peopleneed something tangible to which they may attach their faith, all the otherchurches make use of these replicas. There are now more than twenty thousandchurches and monasteries in Ethiopia and every one of them has at least onetabot.’‘That’s what I thought. But I’m puzzled.’‘Why?’‘Mainly because none of the tabotat I’ve seen looked anything like the biblicaldescription of the Ark. They were all slabs, sometimes made of wood, sometimesmade of stone, and none of them were much more than a foot long and wide or morethan two or three inches thick. If objects like these are supposed to bereplicas of the relic kept in the church of Saint Mary of Zion in Axum then thelogical deduction is that that relic can’t be the Ark of the Covenant after all…’‘Why?’‘Because of the biblical description. Exodus clearly depicts the Ark as afair-sized rectangular chest. Hang on, I’ll look up the details …’I took down my copy of the Jerusalem Bible from the bookshelf above my desk,turned to Chapter 37 of Exodus, found the relevant passage, and read out how theartificer Bezaleel had built the Ark according to the divine plan given to himby Moses:Bezaleel made the Ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, one and a halfcubits wide, one and a half cubits high. He plated it, inside and out, with puregold.11 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts11]‘How long exactly is a cubit?’ Gedai asked.‘Approximately the length of a forearm from the elbow to the tip of the middlefinger – in other words about eighteen inches. So that means the Ark would havebeen about three feet nine inches in length and two feet three inches in widthand depth. Tabotat simply don’t fit those dimensions. They’re much too small.’‘You are right,’ Gedai mused. ‘Nevertheless we do have the original Ark of theCovenant. This is certain. In fact there is even an eyewitness description.’‘You mean the one given by the Armenian legate Dimotheos?’‘No, no. Certainly not. He saw nothing. I am referring to someone who came muchearlier, a geographer named Abu Salih – who was also an Armenian, by the way. Helived in the very early thirteenth century and he made a survey of Christianchurches and monasteries. These churches and monasteries were mainly in Egypt.In addition, however, he visited some neighbouring countries, includingEthiopia, and his book contains material on these countries as well. That iswhere the description of the Ark is given. If I remember correctly it doesaccord quite well with what you have just read me from Exodus.’‘This book of Abu Salih’s? Has it ever been translated into English?’‘Oh yes. A very good translation was made in the nineteenth century. You shouldbe able to find a copy. The editor was a certain Mr Evetts …’Two days later I emerged triumphantly from the stacks of the library of theSchool of Oriental and African Studies in London. In my hand was B. T. Evetts’stranslation of Abu Salih’s monumental Churches and Monasteries of Egypt and someNeighbouring Countries.12 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts12] On page284, in small print, I found the subheading ‘Abyssinia’ followed by eight pagesof observations and comments. Amongst them was this reference:The Abyssinians possess the Ark of the Covenant, in which are the two tables ofstone inscribed by the finger of God with the commandments which he ordained forthe Children of Israel. The Ark of the Covenant is placed upon the altar, but isnot so wide as the altar; it is as high as the knee of a man and is overlaidwith gold.13 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts13]I borrowed a ruler from the librarian and measured my own leg from the sole ofmy foot to my knee: twenty-three inches. This, I felt, was close enough to thetwenty-seven inches given in Exodus to be significant – particularly if thestatement ‘as high as the knee of a man’ had referred to a man wearing shoes orboots. I knew that such a rough measure could never be conclusive as a piece ofevidence; on the other hand it by no means excluded the possibility that theArmenian geographer had seen the original Ark of the Covenant when he had madehis visit to Ethiopia in the thirteenth century. And anyway, from my point ofview, the real importance of the account that he had given was this: itindisputably described a substantial box or chest covered with gold rather thana slab of wood or stone a few inches thick like the tabotat that I had seen –or, for that matter, like the tabot that had been shown to Dimotheos in thenineteenth century.Equally significantly, Abu Salih had given some details about how the objectthat he had seen had been used by the Christians of Axum:The liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times in the year, within the palaceof the king; and a canopy is spread over it when it is taken out from its ownchurch to the church which is in the palace of the king: namely on the feast ofthe great Nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of theHoly Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating cross.14[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts14]There could, it seemed to me, be no question but that this early and quitematter-of-fact eyewitness account provided considerable support for Ethiopia’sclaim to be the last resting place of the genuine Ark of the Covenant. Thedimensions and appearance were roughly right and even Abu Salih’s description ofthe way in which the relic that he had seen had been covered with a ‘canopy’when transported was in accord with the regulations laid down in the Bible:And when the camp setteth forward … they shall take down the covering veil andcover the Ark with it. And they shall … spread over it a cloth.15[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts15]So far so good. But though the Armenian geographer was helpful, he still did notprovide me with any answer to the knotty problem posed by the shape of thatcategory of objects known as tabotat. Nor was this problem one that I couldafford to ignore. I therefore decided to check out the etymology of the Ethiopicword. In its pure and original form, I wondered, did tabot actually mean ‘Ark’?Or did it mean ‘stone tablet’? Or did it mean something else altogether?My investigation into this matter took me into intellectual territory that I hadnever charted before (and that I would prefer never to have to chart again),namely linguistics. Ploughing through reams of obscure and boring documents Iestablished that the ancient Ethiopian language known as Ge’ez, together withits modern and widely spoken descendant Amharic, are both members of the Semiticfamily of languages, to which Hebrew also belongs.16[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts16]I then learned that the word most frequently used in biblical Hebrew to refer tothe Ark of the Covenant was ’aron,17[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts17] which obviously bore nosimilarity whatsoever to tabot. There was another Hebrew word, however – tebah –from which scholars agreed that the Ethiopic tabot had undoubtedly beenderived.18 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts18]I next sought to confirm whether this word tebah had featured in the Hebrew OldTestament, and, after further research, I discovered that it had – though onlytwice. Significantly, in both cases, it had been used to refer to a ship-likecontainer: first the ark of Noah which contained the survivors of the human raceafter the flood,19 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts19] and secondlythe ark of bulrushes which contained the infant Moses after his mother had sethim adrift on the Nile to save him from the wrath of Pharaoh.20[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts20]Turning to the Kebra Nagast I then found one passage in which the Ark of theCovenant was specifically described as ‘the belly of a ship … Two cubits andhalf a cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and half a cubit thebreadth thereof, and thou shalt cover it with pure gold, both the outsidethereof and the inside thereof.’21[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts21] Within this ‘belly of a ship’,furthermore, were to be placed ‘the Two Tables which were written by the fingerof God’.22 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts22]Such language left no room for doubt. Both in terms of its etymology and itsearly usage the Ethiopic word tabot unambiguously connoted the biblical Ark ofthe Covenant in its original form as a gold-covered container – a form for whichthe ‘belly of a ship’ could serve as a clever metaphor capable not only ofsummoning up an image of the object but also of linking it conceptually toearlier ‘ships’: the ark of Noah and the ark of bulrushes, which of course hadboth also contained sacred and precious things.By the same token, however, tabot definitely did not mean or in any way connoteflat solid slabs of wood or stone. So there was still a genuine mystery here.That mystery, however, was finally resolved for me by Professor EdwardUllendorff, Fellow of the British Academy and the first incumbent of the Chairof Ethiopian Studies at the University of London. Now retired and living inOxford, this renowned scholar insisted that he could see no difficulty inexplaining how slabs of wood or stone had come to be referred to as ‘Arks’ bythe Ethiopians:The genuine Ark is supposed to rest at Axum; all other churches can only possessreplicas. In most cases they are not, however, replicas of the whole Ark, butmerely of its supposed contents, i.e. the tablets of the Law … In other words:the description of these stone or wooden tablets as tabotat is simply by way ofa pars pro toto referring to the most important part of the Ark, the tables ofthe Covenant.23 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts23]FLIES IN AMBERBy eliminating an apparent contradiction, Ullendorff’s solution to the tabotproblem lifted one of the clouds of doubt that hovered over Ethiopia’s claim topossess the lost Ark. Other clouds remained, however. Amongst them, one of thedarkest was brought to my attention by Ullendorff himself. In a paper entitled‘The Queen of Sheba in Ethiopian Tradition’ he had indicated very strongly thatthe Kebra Nagast was not to be taken seriously as a work of history; rather itspurpose had been to glorify Ethiopia and it was to this end that the Ark hadbeen introduced into it.24 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts24]Nor was Ullendorff alone in the view that the Kebra Nagast was largelyapocryphal. In the Introduction to his translation of that great epic, forexample, Sir E. A. Wallis Budge pointed out that it was most unlikely that theQueen of Sheba could have been an Ethiopian at all: ‘It is far more probable’,he wrote (rehearsing an argument with which I was already somewhat familiar),‘that her home was Sebha, or Saba, in the south-west of Arabia.’25[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts25]Several authorities made much of the fact that in Solomon’s time – a thousandyears before Christ – Ethiopia had not possessed any real civilization of itsown and certainly had not boasted an advanced urban society capable of producingso illustrious a monarch as the Queen of Sheba. Indeed, the consensus was thatenlightenment had not even begun to dawn in the Abyssinian highlands until aboutthe sixth century BC and had not reached any level of sophistication until somefour hundred years after that. Neither could this period of progress be regardedas an Ethiopian achievement: instead the catalyst had been an influx of Arabtribesmen whose ‘superior qualities’ had revolutionized the sluggish culture ofthe native inhabitants. Coming mainly from the Yemen, these Semitic immigrantshadsettled in the north of Ethiopia and in the process of assimilation with thelocal population brought about a cultural transformation. They brought with themgifts beyond price: religion, a more highly-developed social organization,architecture and art, and a system of writing.26[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts26]In short, Ethiopian civilization was not only much more recent than the Axumitelegends implied but also had been borrowed from elsewhere. In their heart ofhearts, furthermore, most Ethiopians knew this to be true and felt deeplyinsecure about their heritage. Indeed one standard work of history went so faras to suggest that the Kebra Nagast was popular because it filled a deeppsychological need on the part of the Abyssinians ‘to prove their ancientorigins … Parvenu peoples, like parvenu individuals, hanker after ancestors, andpeoples have as little scruple in forging family trees as have individuals.’27[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts27]In my view the importance of all these arguments lay less in the notion that theKebra Nagast was mainly a work of fiction (since that did not preclude thepossibility that what it had to say about the abduction of the Ark could havebeen based on some real event), but rather in the consensus that Ethiopiancivilization was relatively young and that it had been derived from SouthArabia.This consensus had a real bearing on my attempts to establish the legitimacy ofthe Ethiopian claim to the Ark because it applied not only to the generalcivilization of the highlands but also – and quite specifically – to theFalashas. The Kebra Nagast stated quite plainly that the Jewish faith had beenintroduced into Ethiopia in the 950s BC when Menelik and his companions hadarrived with the Ark (indeed it even said that the Queen of Sheba herself hadbeen converted to Judaism).28 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts28] Onthe face of things, therefore, the existence of indigenous black Jews inEthiopia looked like significant corroborative evidence for the Ark’s presence.On closer examination, however, this turned out not to be the case – or at leastnot according to the scholars. As Richard Pankhurst had told me in 1983,29[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts29] the academic establishment wasoverwhelmingly of the opinion that the Jewish faith was unlikely to have reachedEthiopia before the second century AD, and that it had been brought across theRed Sea from the Yemen where a large Jewish community had indeed beenestablished after AD 70 by emigrants fleeing Roman persecutions in Palestine.30[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts30]One of the strongest proponents of this view was Professor Ullendorff, whopresented a long argument on the subject in his influential Ethiopia and theBible and who concluded quite emphatically that the ancestors of the Falashasmust have been converted by Jews who had ‘entered Ethiopia via South Arabia’over a lengthy period from AD 70 through until about AD 550.31[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts31]I decided that I would have to investigate this issue very thoroughly. If theJudaism of the Falashas was indeed less than two thousand years old – and hadcome from Arabia – then a great swathe of apparently convincing ‘culturalcorroboration’ for direct contacts between Ethiopia and Jerusalem in OldTestament times would be obliterated at a stroke and Axum’s lcandidacy as thelast resting place of the Ark would lose much if not all of its credibility.Soon after I began this new phase of my research, however, it became apparent tome that the scholarly consensus in favour of ‘the Yemeni theory’ had largelycome about because there was an absence of evidence for any alternative theory.There was nothing whatever which proved that the Jewish faith could not havearrived by some other route; on the other hand there was no proof that it had.The tendency therefore had been to focus on South Arabia as the likely sourcebecause it was known that there had been other migratory movements from thatregion into Ethiopia.32 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts32]This struck me as a deplorable failure of logic in which absence of evidence,which was one thing, was in fact being treated as evidence of absence – whichwas quite another. To reiterate, the problem was a lack of proof that Judaismmight have arrived in Ethiopia much earlier and by a different route than thescholars believed; but there was no proof at all that this could not have beenthe case.I therefore felt that the field was open and that what I needed to do in orderto satisfy myself one way or the other was to study the traditions, beliefs andbehaviour of the Falashas themselves and to draw my own conclusions about theirorigins from these. I thought it likely, however, that their religiousobservances would have been adulterated during the twentieth century byextensive exposure to western and Israeli visitors. I therefore turned to olderaccounts that depicted their way of life before it had been contaminated bymodern cultural change.Ironically, several of these accounts were written by foreigners who came toEthiopia with the express intention of engineering cultural change, notablynineteenth-century Christian missionaries who had heard rumours of the existenceof a sizeable population of Abyssinian Jews and who had rushed to convert them.One such evangelist was Martin Flad, a young German who arrived in Ethiopia in1855 to proselytize on behalf of the London Society for Promoting Christianityamongst the Jews.33 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts33] His book, TheFalashas of Abyssinia, was published in 1869. I found a worn and much-handledcopy of it in the British Library and soon became intrigued by several passagesin which the author insisted that there must have been Jews in Ethiopia at leastsince the time of the prophet Jeremiah (around 627 BC34[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts34]), and possibly since the reign ofSolomon. Flad based this assertion in part on the fact that:The Falashas know nothing of either the Babylonian or the Jerusalem Talmud,which were composed during and after the time of the captivity. They also do notobserve the Feasts of Purim and of the Dedication of the Temple, which … arestill solemnly kept by the Jews of our time.35[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts35]On further investigation, I discovered that the Feast of the Dedication of theTemple was properly known as Hanukkah (meaning, literally, ‘Dedication’). Frommy point of view the most significant fact about it was that it was institutedin 164 BC36 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts36] and therefore wouldcertainly have been observed by the Jewish community that established itself inthe Yemen after AD 70. The academic orthodoxy which had previously persuaded meto see the Falashas as the descendants of Ethiopians converted by these YemeniJews thus suddenly began to look very suspect. To put matters as plainly aspossible, non-observance of Hanukkah suggested only one rational conclusion: theFalashas must have acquired their Judaism before 164 BC and thus not from theYemen but from some other source.I next researched the Feast of Purim of which Flad had also found Ethiopia’sJews to be ignorant. This festival, too, I learned, had been observed since atleast the second century BC. Indeed it was quite possibly of even earlierprovenance than that: the events that it commemorated took place in themid-fifth century BC and several of the authorities whom I consulted suggestedthat its observance had become widely popular by 425 BC.37[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts37] This raised the interestingpossibility – of which Flad himself had obviously been convinced – that theFalashas had become isolated from the evolving body of world Judaism well beforethat date, perhaps during the sixth century BC.I now had a growing sense that the gap between Abyssinian legend and historicalfact was closing fast: five hundred years before Christ, after all, was onlyfour hundred years after Solomon. It was beginning to look more and moreprobable that the Judaism of the Falashas had arrived in Ethiopia in early OldTestament times – just as the Kebra Nagast and the Falashas themselves hadalways claimed. If this were so, then the implications were clear: at the veryleast the story of the abduction of the Ark to Ethiopia by Menelik deserved tobe taken much more seriously than the academics had hitherto allowed.I found further evidence for this point of view in the account of anothernineteenth-century missionary, Henry Aaron Stern, who was himself aGerman-Jewish convert to Christianity. He had worked and travelled with Flad inEthiopia and had published his own Wanderings among the Falashas in Abyssinia in1862.As I read this 300-page volume I developed an intense dislike for its author,who came across as an arrogant, brutal and unscrupulous proselytizer with norespect whatsoever for the culture or traditions of the people amongst whom hewas working. In general, too, I felt that his descriptions of Falasha religionand lifestyle were thin and poorly observed. As a result, by the time I washalfway through the book I had become thoroughly impatient with it.Then, on page 188, I came across something interesting. Here, after a lengthytreatise on the absolute interdiction amongst the Falashas of ‘intermarriageswith those of another tribe or creed’, Stern described the Ethiopian Jews asbeing faithful to the law of Moses ‘which … is the formula after which they havemoulded their worship.’ He then added:It sounds strange to hear in central Africa of a Jewish altar and atoningsacrifices … [Yet], in the rear of every place of worship is a small enclosurewith a huge stone in the centre; and on this crude altar the victim isslaughtered, and all other sacrificial rites performed.38[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts38]Though at this stage my general knowledge about Judaism was limited to say theleast, I was well aware that animal sacrifice was no longer practised anywherein the world by modern Jews. I had no idea whether this ancient institutionstill existed amongst the Falashas in the late twentieth century; Stern’saccount, however, made it quite clear that it had flourished a hundred andthirty years earlier.Continuing his description of the sacrificial enclosure, the German missionarynext remarked:This sanctum is sacredly guarded from unlawful intrusion … and woe betide thestranger who, ignorant of Falasha customs, ventures too close to the forbiddenprecincts … I was one day on the very verge of committing this unpardonableoffence. It was a very sultry and close noon when, after several hours’fatiguing march, we reached a Falasha village. Eager to obtain a short rest, Iwent in quest of a cool and quiet shelter, when accidentally I espied in themidst of a secluded grassy spot a smooth block that looked as if it had beencharitably placed there to invite the weary to solitude and repose. The thornystockade easily yielded to the iron of my lance, and I was just about toensconce myself behind the flattened stone when a chorus of angryvoices … reminded me of my mistake, and urged me to beat a hasty retreat.39[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts39]I found myself wishing that Stern had received the punishment he deserved forvandalizing a holy place.40 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts40] Atthe same time, however, I could not help but be grateful to him for drawing myattention to the practice of sacrifice amongst the Falashas. This was a leadwell worth following up since it might provide another clue to the date at whichEthiopia’s Jews became separated from the main body of their co-religionists.I devoted considerable effort to researching the obscure subject of Judaicsacrifice in Old Testament times. The picture that eventually emerged from thefog of scholarly references was of a constantly evolving institution thatstarted out as a simple offering to God which anyone, priest or layman, couldmake and in virtually any place where a local shrine had been established. Thisstate of relative unregulation, however, began to change after the Exodus fromEgypt around 1250 BC.41 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts41] Duringthe Hebrews’ wanderings in the wilderness of Sinai the Ark of the Covenant wasbuilt and housed in a portable tent or ‘tabernacle’. Thenceforward allsacrifices were to be made at the door of this tabernacle and anyone disobeyingthe new law was to be punished by banishment:Whatsoever man there be of the House of Israel … that offereth a burnt offeringor sacrifice and bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation, to offer it unto the Lord; even that man shall be cut off fromamong his people.42 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts42]I learned, however, that this prohibition was rather less absolute than itsounded. The main point of the code was not to abolish sacrifice at localshrines in all circumstances but rather to ensure that sacrifices were carriedout exclusively at a centralized national place of worship when and if such aplace existed. In the wilderness the tabernacle housing the Ark was such acentral point. Later, from roughly 1200 to 1000 BC, a national sanctuary wasestablished in Israel at Shiloh, which thus became the new sacrificial centre.Significantly, however, there were periods of political upheaval when Shiloh wasabandoned and during these periods the Hebrews were permitted to sacrifice onceagain at local shrines.43 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts43]By the 950s BC Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem had superseded Shiloh as thenational religious centre. There is evidence, however, that local sacrifices didtake place elsewhere from time to time, particularly amongst those Jews livingfar from the capital. Indeed it was not until the reign of King Josiah (640-609BC) that a blanket ban on all forms of sacrifice other than at the Temple beganto be strictly enforced.44 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts44]So seriously was this prohibition taken that the Jews appear not to haveattempted sacrifice of any kind in the decades immediately following theTemple’s destruction by Nebuchadnezzar in 587 BC. The early tradition ofreverting to local shrines in the absence of a centralized national place ofworship seems to have been irrevocably abandoned. Quite simply, while there wasno Temple there could be no sacrifice.45[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts45]After the return from the Babylonian Exile, the Second Temple was built inJerusalem and the institution of sacrifice was re-established exclusively withinits precincts; meanwhile the absolute prohibition on local offerings wasreinforced and appears to have been strictly obeyed. This system of centralizedsacrifice remained firmly in place from 520 BC, when the Second Temple wasdedicated, until 70 AD when it was razed to the ground by the Roman EmperorTitus.46 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts46]No Third Temple had ever been contemplated, other than by millennial groups wholinked the fulfilment of that dream with the coming of the still-awaitedMessiah.47 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts47] In consequence, sinceAD 70, sacrifice had everywhere been abandoned by the Jews. The Falashas werethe sole exception to this rule.48[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts48] Moreover Stern’s accountsuggested that they had offered sacrifices at all their places of worship whenhe had worked amongst them in the nineteenth century. With a little furtherresearch I was able to confirm that this tradition was so strong that sacrificescontinued to be made by the majority of Falasha communities today despite theirincreased exposure to modern Jewish practices.49[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts49]As I considered this fact, I realized that there might be a number of possibleexplanations for it. The most obvious and attractive of these explanations,however, was also the simplest – and therefore the most likely to be correct. Iwrote in my notebook:The ancestors of today’s Falashas must have been converted to Judaism at a timewhen it was still acceptable for those far away from the centralized nationalsanctuary to practise local sacrifice. That would suggest that the conversiontook place before King Josiah’s ban – i.e. no later than the seventh century BCand possibly even earlier than that.HYPOTHESIS: At some stage after the building of Solomon’s Temple (mid-900s BC)but before Josiah (mid-600s BC) a group of Jews migrated from Israel and settledin Ethiopia. They established local shrines at which they conducted sacrificesto their God and they began to convert the natives of the country to theirfaith. Perhaps they initially maintained contact with their homeland. Thedistance was great, however, and it is reasonable to suppose that they wouldeventually have became completely isolated. They would thus have been untouchedby the great revolutions in theological thought that took place in the Judaicworld in subsequent centuries.This explains why the Falashas are the only Jews still practising sacrifice.Frozen like flies in amber, trapped in a time-warp, they are the last survivingpractitioners of genuine First Temple Judaism.So far so good. But QUESTION: why would a group of Jews have migrated fromIsrael to somewhere as far away as Ethiopia? We are talking the tenth to seventhcenturies BC here, not exactly the jet age. The émigrés must therefore have hada very strong motive. What could that have been?ANSWER: The Kebra Nagast is in no doubt about what the motive was. It says thatthe migrants were the first-born sons of the elders of Israel, and that theycame to Ethiopia in the entourage of Menelik to attend the Holy Ark of theCovenant which they had abducted from the Temple.DECLINE AND FALLIf the Kebra Nagast’s account of the arrival of Judaism in Ethiopia were true, Ireasoned, then I might expect to find evidence somewhere in the historicalannals to prove that the Jewish faith had formerly enjoyed a much greaterprominence in that country than it did today. That certainly would make sense ifit had originally been associated with so exalted a figure as Menelik I. Iremembered, moreover, that my old friend Richard Pankhurst had mentionedsomething to me that was relevant to this line of inquiry. When we had workedtogether in 1983 he had told me that the Falashas had once been a prosperous andpowerful people with kings of their own.I therefore placed another telephone call to Richard in Addis Ababa to see if hecould recommend any sources that might shed light on the decline and fall of theFalashas.He directed me to a book with which I was already slightly familiar: Travels toDiscover the Source of the Nile in the Years 1768-1773 written by the Scottishadventurer James Bruce of Kinnaird. Pankhurst also suggested that I should lookinto the ‘Royal Chronicles’ compiled during the reigns of a number of Ethiopianemperors since medieval times. These, he said, documented a series of wars thathad been fought between the Christians and the Jews and could be of interest.‘Other than that,’ he added, ‘I’m not sure where you can get the kind ofinformation you want. The problem is that almost nothing in depth was everwritten about the Falashas before Bruce.’James Bruce of Kinnaird, as I was to discover, was something of an enigma.Hailing from a staunchly Presbyterian Stirlingshire family, he had belonged tothe minor aristocracy and had inherited sufficient wealth to indulge a lifelongpassion for overseas travel. Initially it seemed to me that it was only thiswanderlust that had lured him into the heart of the Ethiopian highlands. When Ibegan to look at his work on the Falashas, however, it gradually dawned on methat his interest in these people had been too intense and too sustained to beexplained away merely as the normal curiosity of an intelligent traveller. Overa period of several years he had carried out meticulous research into the faith,customs and historical origins of Abyssinia’s black Jews. In the process,interviewing elders and religious figures, he had recorded many ancienttraditions that would otherwise most certainly have been lost to history.Amongst these traditions was one which stated that King Ezana of Axum had beenreading the Psalms of David when he was first introduced to Frumentius, theyoung Syrian who later converted him to Christianity.50[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts50] Bruce, furthermore, made it quiteclear that the monarch’s acquaintance with this book of Old Testament verseresulted from the widespread prevalence of Judaism in Ethiopia at that time51[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts51] – i.e. the early part of thefourth century AD.In the context of what I now knew about Falasha customs, I was happy to givecredence to this assertion. Indeed I took it as additional support for my ownrapidly evolving hypothesis – namely that a form of the Jewish faithincorporating archaic traditions of blood sacrifice had been in Ethiopia for atleast a thousand years before Frumentius turned up to preach the gospel ofChrist.I was soon to find further confirmation of this in an old and rare Ethiopicmanuscript that had once rested in the Tigrayan fortress of Magdala (stormed andlooted by British forces under General Napier in the nineteenth century).Entitled A History and Genealogy of the Ancient Kings it contained the followingpassage:Christianity was introduced into Abyssinia 331 years after the birth of Christby Abuna Salama, whose former name was Frumentos or Frumentius. At that time theEthiopian kings reigned over Axum. Before the Christian religion was known inEthiopia half the inhabitants were Jews, who observed the Law; the other halfwere worshippers of Sando, the dragon.52[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts52]The reference to worshippers of ‘the dragon’ – presumably a rubric for all sortsof primitive animistic gods – was interesting. It suggested that Judaism had atno point become the exclusive state religion of Ethiopia and that, in thepre-Christian era, the Falashas – like Jews everywhere – had accepted thecoexistence of many pagan creeds. I reasoned, however, that they wouldundoubtedly have been put on their guard, and been tempted to abandon theirtraditional tolerance, by the arrival of a militantly evangelistic monotheisticsect like the Christians, whom they would have had good reason to see as a realthreat to their preeminence and to their beliefs. The conversion of the Axumiteking would have looked particularly ominous in such a context and thereafterJews and Christians might well have found themselves locked in bitter struggle.There was considerable support for this analysis amongst the traditions recordedby Bruce. The Scottish adventurer asserted, for example, that the Falashaswere very powerful at the time of the conversion to Christianity or, as theyterm it, ‘the Apostasy’. At this time they declared a prince of the tribe ofJudah, and of the race of Solomon and Menelik, to be their sovereign … Thisprince … refused to abandon the religion of his forefathers.53[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts53]Such a state of affairs, Bruce added, was bound to lead to conflict since theChristians, too, claimed to be ruled by a king descended from the line ofSolomon. The conflict, when it came, was thus precipitated by concerns that wereentirely secular:Although there was no bloodshed upon difference of religion, yet, each having adistinct king with the same pretensions, many battles were fought from motivesof ambition and rivalship of sovereign power.54[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts54]Bruce provided no details of these ‘many battles’ and the history books, too,were silent concerning them – other than noting that in the sixth century ADKaleb, a Christian king of Axum, assembled a vast army and took it across theRed Sea to do battle with a Jewish monarch in the Yemen.55[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts55] Was it not quite probable, I nowspeculated, that this Arabian campaign had been an escalation of fightingbetween Jews and Christians in Ethiopia itself?Evidence that this might indeed have been the case was contained in the KebraNagast. Towards the end of the great epic I found specific mention of King Kalebin a chapter that seethed with anti-Judaic sentiments: here, for no apparentreason, the Ethiopian Jews were suddenly described as the ‘enemies of God’;furthermore, the text advocated that they should be ‘cut to pieces’ and thattheir lands should be laid waste.56[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts56]All this was said in a context that ascribed two sons to Kaleb. One of thesesons was named ‘Israel’ while the other was referred to as ‘Gebra Maskal’ (anEthiopic term meaning ‘Slave of the Cross’). The symbolism of a Jewish-Christianrift was hard to miss (with the Christian faction, of course, being representedby Gebra Maskal and the Jewish faction by Israel). And this analysis began tolook even more credible when I remembered that the Falashas never referred tothemselves as ‘Falashas’ but always as ‘Beta Israel’, i.e. ‘House of Israel’.57[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts57]The basic message, therefore, seemed clear enough; nevertheless, the wholepassage was complicated by dense and obscure imagery. Several times, forexample, the words ‘Chariot’ and ‘Zion’ cropped up. I could make little or nosense of the former. I already knew very well, however, that the latter – ‘Zion’– was one of a number of different epithets for the Ark of the Covenant usedfrequently in the Kebra Nagast.58 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts58]Everything became clear when I read that Israel and Gebra Maskal were destinedto fight each other. After this battle, the text continued:God will say to Gebra Maskal, ‘Choose thou between the Chariot and Zion’, and Hewill cause him to take Zion, and he shall reign openly upon the throne of hisfather. And God will make Israel to choose the chariot, and he shall reignsecretly and he shall not be visible.59[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts59]In this fashion, the Kebra Nagast concluded:The kingdom of the Jews shall be made an end of and the Kingdom of Christ shallbe constituted … Thus hath God made for the King of Ethiopia more glory andgrace and majesty than for all the other kings of the earth because of thegreatness of Zion, the Ark of the Law of God.60[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts60]It seemed to me beyond any reasonable doubt that what was being described here,albeit in arcane and symbolic language, was a conflict between the Jews andChristians of Ethiopia – a battle for supremacy in which the followers of thenew religion triumphed while the followers of the older faith were vanquished,thereafter to live invisibly in secret places. It was also clear that the Ark ofthe Covenant – ‘Zion’ – had stood at the heart of this struggle for power andthat the Christians had in some way managed to wrest it from the Jews whothenceforward had had to content themselves with the ‘Chariot’, in other wordswith second best.As my researches continued, however, it became obvious that the Falashas had nottamely accepted the invisibility and second-class status that the Christians hadsought to impose on them. On the contrary, I found a considerable body ofevidence to suggest that they had fought back – and, furthermore, that they haddone so with great determination and over a rather lengthy period.The first tantalizing hint of sustained warfare between Abyssinia’s Jews andChristians came in an account written by a ninth-century traveller named EldadHadani – better known as Eldad ‘the Danite’ because he claimed descent from thelost Israeli tribe of Dan. Exactly who he was, or where he came from, was by nomeans clear. In a widely circulated letter written in AD 833, however, he hadclaimed that the Danites – and three other ‘lost’ Jewish clans – lived inEthiopia where they were locked in permanent antagonism with the Christianrulers of that country: ‘And they slew the men of Ethiopia and unto this veryday they fight with the children of the kingdoms of Ethiopia.’61[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts61]On investigating further I discovered that several authorities regarded Eldad asa charlatan and his letter as an improbable piece of fiction. Others, however,felt that much of what he said was firmly grounded in fact.62[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts62] I had no hesitation in aligningmyself with the latter camp – simply because Eldad’s references to theAbyssinian Jews were too close to the truth about the Falashas to have been purefabrications. He insisted, for example, that they had emigrated from the HolyLand to Ethiopia in First Temple times, shortly after the separation of thekingdoms of Judah and Israel (i.e. around 931 BC63[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts63]). In consequence, he said, theydid not celebrate festivals instituted after that date such as Purim andHanukkah. Neither did they have rabbis ‘for these were of the Second Temple andthey did not reach them.’64 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts64]I was already well aware of the non-observance of the later festivals by theFalashas, and of the implications of this. On checking I now discovered thatthey did not have rabbis either: indeed their religious officials were calledkahen, a word derived from the Hebrew kohen (more familiar as the common nameCohen) meaning ‘priest’ and dating back to the era of the First Temple.65[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts65]All in all, therefore, it did sound very much as though Eldad had been inEthiopia as he had claimed, and had given a faithful enough description of thestate of Judaism there in the mid-ninth century AD. His report of sustainedfighting between the Abyssinian Jews and their neighbours during this periodthus also looked quite plausible:And their banner is white and written thereon in black is ‘Hear O Israel, theLord our God is one God’… They are numerous as the sands of the sea, and have noemployment but war and, whensoever they fight, they say it is not good formighty men to flee, let them die young, but let them not flee, let themstrengthen their heart unto God, and several times they say and cry all of themtogether, ‘Hear O Israel, our God is one God’, and then they all take heed.66[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts66]Eldad concluded that the Jewish tribes in Ethiopia had been successful in theirwarlike endeavours and had ‘placed their hands on the necks of their enemies’.67[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts67] This, it seemed to me, wasnothing more nor less than a fairly accurate description of the true balance ofpower between Christians and Jews in the ninth and early tenth centuries AD. Itwas, after all, at precisely this time that the Christian Solomonic dynasty ofAxum had been overthrown. And I already knew from my previous research that thiscoup d’état had been the work of a Jewish monarch – a great queen named Gudit(or Judit, or possibly Yehudit).As outlined in Chapter 5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c05_r1.htm], Gudit’s brief andbloody reign was followed, perhaps half a century later, by the establishment ofthe Zagwe dynasty, to which King Lalibela had belonged. Although they werealmost certainly Jews at the outset, the Zagwes themselves later converted toChristianity and subsequently (about fifty years after Lalibela’s death)abdicated the throne in favour of a monarch claiming Solomonic descent.Whatever else it achieved, however, it quickly became apparent to me that theZagwe interregnum had not halted the chronic state of conflict between theAbyssinian Jews and Christians. As my researches continued I learned thatBenjamin of Tudela, a widely travelled Spanish merchant who lived in the twelfthcentury, had reported the existence of Jews in Ethiopia who were ‘not under theyoke of the Gentiles’, and who had ‘cities and castles on the summits ofmountains’. He spoke of wars with the Christians in which the Falashas werenormally successful, taking ‘spoil and booty’ at will because no man could‘prevail against them’.68 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts68]Then, in the fifteenth century, the Jewish traveller Elijah of Ferrara relatedthat he had met a young Falasha in Jerusalem and was told how hisco-religionists ‘preserved their independence in a mountainous region from whichthey launched continual wars against the Christian emperors of Ethiopia.’69[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts69]A hundred years later the Jesuit Bishop of Oviedo asserted that the Falashas hidaway in ‘great inaccessible mountains; and they had dispossessed the Christiansof many lands which they were masters of, and the kings of Ethiopia could notsubdue them, because they have but small forces, and it is very difficult topenetrate into the fastnesses of their rocks.’70[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts70]The bishop was wrong, however. His statement was made in 1557 – by which date,far from ‘dispossessing’ anyone, the Falashas were actually under sustainedattack from Christian forces bent, apparently, on genocide. Sarsa Dengel, theSolomonic emperor who ruled from 1563 to 1594, waged a seventeen-year campaignagainst them – a campaign described by one respected scholar as ‘a veritablecrusade, inspired by religious fanaticism.’71[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts71]During the fighting, which saw brutal onslaughts against Falasha strongholds inthe Simien mountains west and south of the Takazze river, the defendersacquitted themselves with great dignity. Even Sarsa Dengel’s sycophanticchronicler could not avoid expressing admiration for the courage of one group ofJewish women who, rather than be captured and used by the emperor’s men, hurledthemselves off a cliff with the cry ‘Adonai [God] help me’.72[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts72]Later the Falasha king, Radai, was taken prisoner. Offered his life if only hewould beg the Virgin Mary for mercy – and death if he would not – he is reportedto have said: ‘Is not the mention of the name of Mary forbidden? Make haste! Itis better for me that I should depart from a world of lies to a world ofjustice, from the darkness to the light; kill me, swiftly.’ The emperor’sgeneral, Yonael, answered: ‘If you prefer death, die bravely and bow your head.’Radai then bowed and Yonael struck him with a great sword: the single blowinstantly decapitated the Falasha monarch and passed through his knees also, theblade finally burying itself in the ground. Those who witnessed this horriblescene were said to have admired ‘the courage of the Jew in death who declaredthe things of the earth are bad and the things of heaven are good.’73[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts73]Towards the end of the same campaign the last two Falasha fortresses in the highSimiens were attacked and overwhelmed despite the bravery of the defenders. Inboth cases the leaders and their picked men chose suicide rather than captivity.This did not bring an end to the persecutions, however. On the contrary, evenworse atrocities were committed after 1607 when Emperor Susneyos ascended thethrone. He launched a pogrom against all Falashas still living in the vasthighland expanses between Lake Tana and the Simien mountains. During the nexttwenty years of ‘unwarrantable butchery’ thousands were killed in fiercefighting and their children were sold as slaves. The few survivors, according tothe detailed account given by the Scottish traveller James Bruce:were ordered upon pain of death to renounce their religion, and be baptised. Tothis they consented, seeing there was no remedy … Many of them were baptisedaccordingly, and they were all ordered to plough and harrow on the Sabbathday.74 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts74]The upshot of such sustained and vindictive oppression was that it foreverdeprived Ethiopia’s Jews of the autonomous statehood that they had obviouslyonce enjoyed – and thus hastened their slide into obscurity. Looking backthrough the admittedly sketchy historical documents at my disposal, I found thatit was even possible to chart this gradual submergence and disappearance innumerical terms.In the early 1600s, for example, the Falashas were said to have numbered some‘100,000 effective men’.75 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts75]Assuming one ‘effective man’ per family of five, this would give a totalpopulation for that period of around 500,000. Nearly three hundred years later –in the late nineteenth century – the Jewish scholar Joseph Halévy put totalFalasha numbers at around 150,000.76[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts76] By the end of the first quarterof the twentieth century this figure had plummeted to just 50,000 – according tothe undoubtedly well-informed estimate of another Jewish investigator, JacquesFaitlovich.77 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts77] Sixty years on, inthe famine year of 1984, the Falasha population of Ethiopia was reliablyestimated at 28,000.78 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts78]My reading left me in no doubt that the watershed had come at the beginning ofthe seventeenth century with the Susneyos campaigns, which had clearly brokenthe back of Falasha resistance. Before that they had been a populous andpowerful folk with kings and a kingdom of their own; afterwards, disenfranchisedand beaten, their numbers remorselessly declined.The historical record, therefore, more than adequately resolved thecontradiction that had been bothering me, namely how to explain the latter-dayvictimization and impoverishment of the Falashas if it were true that Judaismhad been brought to Ethiopia by so exalted a figure as Menelik I – who had alsobrought the Holy Ark of the Covenant, the most precious and prestigious relic ofthe ancient world. I now realized that there was no contradiction at all. Indeeda scenario in which the Jewish religion had once enjoyed great influencesuggested the only possible motive for the merciless pogroms, killings and massenslavements that Susneyos and other Christian emperors had inflicted upon theirFalasha compatriots. Simply stated, such bizarre and apparently psychopathicbehaviour made a twisted kind of sense if the Christians had actively feared thepossibility of a resurgence of Judaism – and if their fear had stemmed from thefact that this rival monotheistic faith had earlier represented an extremelystrong and enduring theme in Ethiopian life.‘CONSUMMATION OF HEART’S DESIRE …’All this, I reasoned, strongly supported the view that Judaism had arrived inEthiopia long before Christianity. By the same token it also added some socialcorroboration to the legendary account of Menelik’s abduction of the Ark. Tosummarize, I now knew that:• The Falashas’ archaic traditions of blood sacrifice – as well as some of theirother religious practices – cast grave doubt on the academic orthodoxy whichfavoured a late (and South Arabian) origin for Ethiopian Judaism. On thecontrary the evidence suggested quite compellingly that the Jewish faith musthave come to Ethiopia in First Temple times and must then have been isolatedthere. Furthermore, the best possible account of how and why Judaism had takenroot in the heart of Africa at so early a date was provided by the Kebra Nagast.Since the story of the abduction of the Ark was central to that account itfollowed that Ethiopia’s claim to possess the sacred relic deserved to be takenseriously.• There was clear evidence to suggest that the Jewish faith had been animportant force in Ethiopia long before the arrival of Christianity in thefourth century AD. This evidence also suggested that Jews and Christians hadsubsequently engaged in a protracted struggle to the death. The winners of thisstruggle had been the Christians – who had, in the process, captured the Ark ofthe Covenant. Thereafter they had gradually incorporated it into their ownnon-Jewish religious ceremonies. This was the only satisfactory explanation forwhat was otherwise an incomprehensible anomaly – namely the crucial role, uniquein the Christian world, played in all Ethiopian church services by replicas ofan Old Testament relic.• These replicas depicted the contents of the Ark – i.e. the tablets of stone –rather than the Ark itself. This had originally confused me; I now understood,however, that it was merely an example of a culture being ‘economical with itssymbols’. In the Holy of Holies of every one of the more than twenty thousandOrthodox churches in Ethiopia was a tabot. Behind these tabotat – and directlyresponsible for the superstitious dread which they inspired in the generalpopulation – lay a mysterious and puissant object. There now seemed to me to beevery possibility that that object might indeed be the Holy Ark of the Covenant.Of course there were still several loose ends. These included the importantissue of the ethnic identity of the Queen of Sheba (could she really have beenan Ethiopian?). Linked to this, and of at least equal weight, was anotherlegitimate doubt that the scholars had raised: in the era of Solomon was itreally possible that Ethiopia could have possessed a sufficiently ‘high’civilization to have engaged in direct cultural contact with ancient Israel?Finally there was the problem of Axum – to which Richard Pankhurst had drawn myattention in 1983.79 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts79] The sacredcity had not even existed in Solomon’s time and therefore the Ark could not havebeen brought to it. This did not preclude the possibility that the relic mighthave been deposited at some other place in Ethiopia and then moved to Axum at alater date. If so, where was that ‘other place’ and why had I encountered notraditions concerning it?These, I realized, were questions for which I would eventually have to seekanswers. There were others, too. Indeed it was perhaps intrinsic to the occultand recondite nature of the Ark of the Covenant that it would always generatequestions, confusions, ambiguities and misgivings. An object so rare andprecious, imbued with such power, venerated with such fervour over so manycenturies – and charged with the numinous energy of God – could hardly beexpected to yield up its secrets easily or to any casual inquirer.I felt, however, that the evidence I had already unearthed in support ofEthiopia’s claim to be the last resting place of the relic was sufficientlythought-provoking to merit further research. Moreover, when I combined thisevidence with the results of the decoding exercise that I had just carried outon Wolfram’s Parzival, I found it difficult to resist the conclusion that twoplus two did indeed equal four.In short, knowing what I knew now, it seemed to me hardly surprising that theclandestine tradition of quest that I had identified should have focussed on theAbyssinian highlands. After all, for a group of knights whose very identity wasbound up with the mysteries of Solomon’s Temple, no real historical relic otherthan the Ark could possibly have served as a more fitting object of chivalricendeavour. By the same token, there was only one country in which such anendeavour might have been undertaken with any genuine hope of success – acountry which had a living institution of Ark-worship, a Solomonic heritage, anda credible claim to possess the Ark itself.I therefore believed I was right in my hypothesis that the Templars had launcheda quest in Ethiopia in the late twelfth century and I believed that they hadfound the precious relic which Wolfram had described as ‘the consummation ofheart’s desire’.80 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts80] As I shallrecount in the next chapter, however, I also believed that they had lost itagain – that it had been wrested from them and that they had been obliged toquit Ethiopia without it.Why? Because a very few intrepid men continued to travel to Ethiopia in searchof the Ark long after the utter destruction of the Knights of the Temple ofSolomon in the fourteenth century. Furthermore, though they travelled atdifferent periods, and were born in different lands, all these later adventurerswere directly linked to the Templars and had inherited their traditions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7A SECRET AND NEVER-ENDING QUESTFrom the first to the sixth century AD the empire centred on the city of Axum innorthern Ethiopia could rightly claim to rank amongst the most powerful andprosperous in the known world. It dealt on equal terms with Rome and Persia andsent its navies sailing to ports as far afield as Egypt, India, Ceylon andChina. Its architectural and artistic achievements were impressive and it becamethe first bastion of Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa, adopting the new faithas its official religion in the early fourth century AD (coincidentally at muchthe same time as the miraculous conversion of Constantine the Great).1[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts1]By the seventh century, however, Axum’s light had begun to dim; the embassiesthat it sent abroad were now few and far between and its once formidablemilitary power was clearly in decline. This marked change, which eventually ledto total isolation, had much to do with the advance of the belligerent forces ofIslam and the encirclement of Abyssinian Christianity during and after thelifetime of the Prophet Muhammad (AD 570–632). ‘Encompassed by the enemies oftheir religion,’ wrote Edward Gibbon in his Decline and Fall of the RomanEmpire, ‘the Ethiopians slept for near a thousand years, forgetful of the worldby whom they were forgotten.’2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts2]The millennium to which the great English historian referred lasted from roughlythe seventh to the sixteenth centuries, during which time it would be fair tosay that Ethiopia all but disappeared from world consciousness. Formerly wellknown to outsiders, and relatively well travelled, this Christian country in theremote highlands of Africa was gradually transformed into a mysterious realm ofmyth and magic in which dragons and other monsters were believed to dwell – aterra incognita where no one dared (or wanted) to venture.It would have been tempting to assume that the Abyssinians had reverted tobarbarism or stagnated during the long, dark hole in their history. Myresearches had shown me, however, that the opposite was true: as theextraordinary rock-hewn churches of Lalibela proved, a rich and idiosyncraticculture had been preserved throughout. Moreover, although this culture wasintroverted and suspicious of the motives of foreign powers, it had stayed incontact with the outside world. Prince Lalibela himself had spent twenty-fiveyears as an exile in Jerusalem in the second half of the twelfth century. And ithad been from Jerusalem that he had returned to Ethiopia to claim his kingdomand to build the monolithic churches that now bear his name.As outlined in Chapter 5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c05_r1.htm], my findings hadconvinced me of the possibility that Lalibela might have been accompanied by acontingent of Templars when he left the Holy Land in 1185 to win back histhrone. These knights, I believed, would have been motivated first and foremostby a desire to seek out the Ark of the Covenant in Ethiopia. In furtherance ofthis end it seemed logical to suppose that they would have been more thanwilling to assist the prince to achieve his own political objectives – since byso doing they might reasonably have expected to gain great influence.The reader will recall that I then learned of an Ethiopian tradition which toldof the involvement of mysterious ‘white men’ in the construction of the Lalibelachurches. This tradition was an ancient one. Indeed, it had already been veryold when it had first been recorded in the early sixteenth century by aPortuguese visitor, Father Francisco Alvarez. I knew that the Templars had beengreat builders and architects,3 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts3]and it was therefore difficult to resist the conclusion that they might havebeen the ‘white men’ who had had a hand in the creation of the rock-hewnmonoliths. Furthermore, since the churches were twenty-four years in the making,the implication was that the knights had – at the very least – had a sustainedpresence in Ethiopia and perhaps had entertained plans for an even longer-terminvolvement in the affairs of that country.The suspicion that this might indeed have been the case deepened as my researchcontinued. In order to explain why, it is first of all necessary to acquaint thereader with what happened to the Templars during and immediately after thebrutal suppression of the order in the early fourteenth century. It is alsonecessary to cross-reference this information with certain events that tookplace in Ethiopia at around the same time.A PERIOD INVOLVED IN DARKNESSFounded in the year 1119, and given official recognition by the church in 1128at the Synod of Troyes, the Templars quickly rose to a position of greatinternational power, wealth and prestige – a position from which they werenevertheless doomed to fall within two centuries. The history of the order’scatastrophic collapse has been too frequently and thoroughly recounted elsewhereto require extensive repetition here.4[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts4] Suffice it to say that quitesuddenly, on Friday 13 October 1307, all Templars residing in France werearrested. This was a well co-ordinated operation that saw simultaneous dawnswoops on hundreds of Templar properties by the bailiffs and seneschals of theFrench king, Philip IV. By nightfall 15,000 men were in chains and Friday the13th had won a unique place for itself in the popular imagination as the mostunlucky and inauspicious date in the calendar.The charges levelled against the Templars to justify their dramatic andhumiliating arrests were as lurid as they were imaginative. They were accused,for example, of denying Christ and spitting on His image, and of giving eachother indecent kisses ‘in shame of human dignity, according to the profane riteof the order’ (these kisses were said to be placed on the anus, navel and mouthof each initiate at the time of his induction). It was also alleged that theyengaged in a wide range of other homosexual practices (which were ‘requiredwithout the possibility of refusal’), and – last but not least – that they madeofferings to idols.5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts5]At this time (and until 1377) the official residence of the Papacy was the cityof Avignon in Provence. The reasons for the abandonment of the Vatican need notbe gone into here.6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts6] Obviously,however, the removal of the Holy See to a point so close to French territorygave King Philip great influence over the Pope (Clement V who had been crownedat Lyons in Philip’s presence in 13057[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts7]). This influence was exercised tothe detriment of the Templars, whose destruction Philip was determined to ensurenot only in France but also in every other country in which they wereestablished. To this end the French monarch put pressure on Clement V who in duecourse issued a bull (Pastoralis praeeminentiae, dated 22 November 1307) whichordered the arrest of the Templars throughout the Christian world.8[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts8]Proceedings followed as far afield as England, Spain, Germany, Italy and Cyprusand, in 1312, another bull from the puppet Pope officially suppressed the order.Meanwhile thousands of Templars had been subjected to the most horrific torturesand inquisitions. Many were subsequently burned at the stake – including GrandMaster Jacques de Molay and the Preceptor of Normandy, Geoffroi de Charnay.9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts9]It is not my intention here to go in any depth into the persecution, trial anddestruction of the Templars. I only became interested in these matters becauseof the evidence I had unearthed which suggested a possible Templar quest for theArk in Ethiopia in the late twelfth century. Having established that a group ofknights could have accompanied Lalibela from Jerusalem in the year 1185 Inaturally wondered what might have happened next – and this curiosity led me tolook for clues in the subsequent history of the Templar Order.That history, of course, was rather short: less than 130 years after Lalibela’saccession to the throne of Ethiopia the Templars had been rounded up, tortured,and burnt at the stake. Their properties and money had been shared out amongstthe ruling houses of Europe; their order had ceased to exist; and their goodname had been tainted by charges of sodomy, blasphemy and idolatry.Nor, in the records of the last century of their existence, could I find asingle shred of evidence to support the view of a sustained Templar quest inEthiopia. After the early 1200s the trail simply went cold; from then until thearrests in 1307 the order seemed to have been concerned solely with itscampaigns in the Near East and with the build-up of its own considerable powerand wealth.Where else, I wondered, might I find the information I was looking for? Fewattempts had been made to chronicle developments in Ethiopia in the period thatnow concerned me. I knew, however, that James Bruce had done his utmost togather and record ancient traditions during his lengthy visit in the eighteenthcentury. I therefore turned to his Travels – which I now kept constantly on mydesk.Towards the end of Volume I, as I had hoped, I came across several pages devotedto the reign of King Lalibela. Unfortunately much of what the Scottishadventurer had written was irrelevant to my own investigation. There was,however, one particular detail that attracted my attention. Drawing on ‘thehistories and traditions … thought the most authentic’ in Ethiopia,10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts10] Bruce reported that Lalibela hadpromoted a scheme to reduce the downstream flow of water into the Nile riversystem in order ‘to famish Egypt’.11[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts11] After ‘an exact survey andcalculation’, it seemed this illustrious monarch of the Zagwe dynasty hadascertained:that there ran on the summit, or highest part [of Ethiopia], several riverswhich could be intercepted by mines, and their stream directed into the lowcountry southward, instead of joining the Nile, augmenting it and runningnorthward. By this he found he should be able so to disappoint its increase,that it never would rise to a height proper to fit Egypt for cultivation.12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts12]Such a project, I could not help but think, would certainly have suited Templarambitions which, by the end of Lalibela’s reign (AD 1211), had begun to focus onthe conquest of Egypt. Several extensive battles were fought at this time on thebanks of the Nile, and the Templars spent more than a year besieging the Arabfortress at Damietta in the delta.13[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts13] There could be no doubt,therefore, that a ‘famished’ and weakened Egypt would have been very much totheir liking.In the event, however, the diversion of the rivers was never completed: ‘Death,the ordinary enemy of all these stupendous undertakings, interposed here and puta stop to this enterprise of Lalibela.’14[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts14] Bruce then added a comment on thelast two monarchs of the Zagwe dynasty:To Lalibela succeeded Imrahana Christos, remarkable for nothing but being son ofsuch a father as Lalibela, and father to such a son as Naakuto Laab; both ofthem distinguished for works very extraordinary, though very different in theirkind. The first, that is those of the father, we have already hinted at,consisting in great mechanical undertakings. The other was an operation of themind, of still more difficult nature, a victory over ambition, the voluntaryabdication of a crown.15 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts15]I was already familiar with the historical details that followed. In 1270,Naakuto Laab – the last of the Zagwes – was persuaded to abdicate his throne infavour of a certain Yekuno Amlak, a monarch claiming Solomonic descent. Thisking, as the reader may recall, had been biding his time in the distant provinceof Shoa where the Solomonic line had been preserved by the descendants of thesingle royal prince who had escaped the uprising of the Jewish queen Gudit inthe tenth century.16 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts16]Bruce had little or nothing to say about Yekuno Amlak himself, or about hisimmediate successors, Yagba Zion (1285–94) and Wedem Ara’ad (who ruled until theyear 1314). Indeed, it seemed that the normally fastidious research methodsfavoured by the Scottish traveller had failed to yield any solid information atall for the century that followed Lalibela’s death in AD 1211: ‘All this periodis involved in darkness,’ Bruce complained. ‘We might guess, but since we arenot able to do more, it answers no good purpose to do so much.’17[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts17]Similar darkness, as I already knew, also enshrouded the period beforeLalibela’s accession to the throne. I was therefore left with a host ofunanswered questions. Of these by far the most important concerned the Ark ofthe Covenant: I needed to know what had happened to it during the roughly 300years (from the tenth to the thirteenth century) in which the rule of theSolomonic dynasty had been interrupted. And I needed to know whether theTemplars might have gained direct access to the sacred relic if, as I supposed,they had established themselves in Ethiopia during Lalibela’s reign.Once again I telephoned the historian Belai Gedai in Addis Ababa to see if hecould enlighten me with his knowledge of local traditions.‘In the tenth century’, he told me, ‘we Ethiopians say that the Ark was removedfrom Axum by the priests and the people in order to keep it safe from theravages of Queen Gudit, and we say that it was brought to an island on LakeZwai …’‘You mean in the Rift Valley – south of Addis Ababa?’‘Yes.’‘That was a hell of a long way for it to be moved.’‘Yes, but no lesser distance would have been safe. Gudit was Jewish, you know.She wanted to establish the Falasha religion all over the country and she wantedto destroy Christianity. She came to burn and rob the churches at Axum. So thepriests carried off the Ark to prevent it from falling into her hands, and theybrought it very far – all the way to Zwai! – where they were sure that it wouldbe out of her reach.’‘Do you know how long it remained on the island?’‘Our traditions say that it was there for seventy years and that after that itwas taken back to Axum.’I thanked Gedai for his help and rang off. What he had told me fitted – more orless – with the picture of Ethiopian medieval history that I had thus farmanaged to piece together. I knew that the throne of Ethiopia had been held byGudit for some years after she had deposed the Solomonids. I also knew that shehad eventually been succeeded by the first monarch of the Zagwe dynasty, himselfprobably a Jew.Later, however (and certainly well before Lalibela’s time), the Zagwes hadconverted to Christianity. It therefore seemed quite possible that they mighthave permitted the safe return of the Ark to its customary resting place in Axum– where, presumably, it would still have been when Lalibela came to power.Of obvious relevance to this argument was the eyewitness account of the Ark inEthiopia given by the Armenian geographer Abu Salih in his Churches andMonasteries of Egypt and some Neighbouring Countries. From internal textualevidence (the translator and editor of this important work explained in hisIntroduction), it was clear that it had been written ‘in the first years of thethirteenth century’18 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts18] – in otherwords during the reign of Lalibela himself. And although Abu Salih at no pointstated in which Ethiopian city he had seen the sacred relic, there was no goodreason to suppose that this city had not been Axum. Moreover, as I re-read therelevant passage, I was struck by a few words that I had overlooked before.Describing the transportation of the Ark on certain ceremonial occasions, thegeographer had noted that it was ‘attended and carried, by bearers who were‘white and red in complexion, with red hair’.19[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts19]With a shock of genuine excitement I realized that I was looking at a secondpiece of pure and early testimony suggesting the presence of mysterious whitemen in Ethiopia at the time of King Lalibela (particularly so since anotherauthoritative translation of the same passage rendered ‘red hair’ as ‘blondhair’20 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts20]). Alvarez had alreadyalerted me to the old tradition that white men had built the wonderful rock-hewnchurches – a tradition that fitted well with what I knew about the advancedarchitectural skills possessed by the Templars. Now, as though to bear out myown evolving theory, here was Abu Salih addressing me across seven centurieswith the electrifying news that men who were white and red in complexion, menwith red or even blond hair – men, in other words, who sounded very much likenorthern Europeans – had been associated closely and directly with the Ark ofthe Covenant itself.The possibility that these men might have been Templars was a very seductiveone, but it still left my investigation stranded in the early thirteenth centuryand it still left the key questions unanswered. If the northern Europeans seenby Abu Salih had indeed been Templars then had they just contented themselveswith carrying the relic from time to time or had they perhaps tried to remove itfrom Ethiopia and take it back to Europe? Most important of all – if they hadtried, had they succeeded?On all these points, I had to admit, I was effectively blocked by the absolutelack of historical information. Obsessively secretive as the Templars hadundoubtedly been,21 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts21] it did notreally surprise me that their own documents and records yielded so little. Norwas there any comfort to be gained from Ethiopian annals: after examining a widerange of different sources, I was forced to accept that the century after thedeath of King Lalibela had indeed been a period ‘involved in darkness’, just asJames Bruce had observed. Almost nothing was known about what had gone on inthese years.I was by now feeling extremely pessimistic about the prospects of ever breakingthe research deadlock. Nevertheless I telephoned Richard Pankhurst in AddisAbaba and asked him if there were any records which might suggest that there hadbeen contacts of any kind between Ethiopians and Europeans during the period inquestion.‘None that I know of before 1300,’ he replied.‘And how about after 1300? I suppose the first documented European contact waswith the Portuguese embassy that arrived in Ethiopia in 1520?’‘Not quite. A small number of missions travelled in the other direction beforethat – I mean from Ethiopia to Europe. As it happens, the very first of thesewas sent within a century of Lalibela’s death – so that does put it into theperiod you’re interested in.’I sat forward in my chair: ‘Do you happen to know the exact date?’‘Yes, I do,’ Richard replied. ‘It was 1306, and it was quite a large mission. Itwas sent by the Emperor Wedem Ara’ad and it had, I believe, about thirtymembers.’‘Do you remember what the purpose of this mission was?’‘I’m not absolutely certain. You would have to check the source. But I do knowthat its destination was Avignon in the south of France.’A FINAL SOLUTION?Richard did not realize it, but he had just dropped a small bombshell. Avignonhad been the seat of Pope Clement V – who had been crowned at Lyons in 1305 inthe presence of King Philip of France. Moreover, as I was already well aware, ithad been Clement V who had ordered the arrest of the Templars throughoutChristendom in 1307. Now I had learned that a high-level Ethiopian delegation(the first ever to be sent to Europe) had visited Avignon in 1306 – just a yearbefore the arrests. Were these dates and events clustered together bycoincidence? Or was there, perhaps, some underlying pattern of cause and effect?To get answers to these questions I would have to try to establish whether theAbyssinian envoys had in fact met with the Pope during their visit and, if theyhad, I would also have to try to learn what had passed between them.The original source of information on the 1306 mission had been a Genoesecartographer, Giovanni da Carignano, who had been active in map-making duringthe years 1291–1329.22 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts22] I wasintrigued to discover that this same Carignano had been responsible for a majorshift in European ideas about Ethiopia: after centuries of confusion (seediscussion in Chapter 4 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c04_r1.htm]) he had been thefirst authority to affirm unambiguously that ‘Prester John’ ruled in Africarather than in ‘India’.23 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts23]Carignano had met with the members of the Ethiopian embassy when they had passedthrough Genoa in 1306 on their way back from Avignon to their homeland. Becauseof adverse winds they had spent ‘many days’ in the Italian port and there thecartographer had questioned them about ‘their rites, customs and regions’.24[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts24]Regrettably, however, Carignano’s treatise containing all the information thatthe Ethiopians had given him had subsequently been lost. All that remained of ittoday was a brief abstract preserved in a Bergamese chronicle of the latefifteenth century written by a certain Jacopo Filippo Foresti.25[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts25]I finally managed to get my hands on an English translation of the abstract inquestion. It consisted of only a single paragraph in which Foresti praised andthen summarized Carignano’s treatise:Amongst many things written in it about the state of [the Ethiopians] … it issaid that their emperor is most Christian, to whom seventy-four kings and almostinnumerable princes pay allegiance … It is known that this emperor in the … yearof our salvation 1306 sent thirty envoys [who] … presented themselvesreverentially before Pope Clement V at Avignon.26[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts26]And that – apart from a few frills and the ‘Prester John’ reference alreadymentioned – was all that was known about the first-ever Ethiopian mission toEurope. Skimpy though the data was, however, it did confirm my suspicion thatthe envoys had met with Pope Clement V27[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts27] – and that they had done so justa year before he authorized the mass arrests of the Knights Templar.No information was given concerning the substance of the meeting; nor was therethe slightest hint as to why the Emperor of Ethiopia should have been so anxiousto make contact with Pope Clement V in the year 1306. It seemed to meimprobable, however, that Wedem Ara’ad would have sent so large an embassy onsuch a long and unprecedented mission if he had not had a very strong motiveindeed. I now felt at liberty to speculate about what that motive might havebeen.Opening my notebook I jotted down the following series of propositions,conjectures and hypotheses:Assume for the moment that the Templars did go from Jerusalem to Ethiopia withPrince Lalibela in 1185 – and that they did help to install him on his throne.Assume that the ‘white men’ said to have built the Lalibela churches were infact Templars. Assume also that the ‘white men’ seen acting as bearers for theArk of the Covenant in Ethiopia in the early 1200s were these same Templars.The implication is that the order had succeeded in winning a position of power,trust and influence with Lalibela, and with the Zagwe dynasty to which hebelonged. If so then it would be reasonable to assume that the last two Zagwemonarchs (Imrahana Christos and Naakuto Laab) would also have had a goodrelationship with the Templars – whom they might have continued to grantprivileged access to the Ark.Assume that this was what happened and that during the six decades afterLalibela’s death in 1211 the Templars were allowed to approach the sacred relicbut not, of course, to take it out of Ethiopia. Perhaps they planned to take itbut were simply biding their time until a favourable opportunity presenteditself. Meanwhile, as the knights who had originally come to Ethiopia grew oldthe order would have sent out others from the Holy Land to replace them. Therewould have been no particular sense of urgency; indeed they might have beenquite content for the Ark to stay in Ethiopia.This state of affairs would have changed dramatically in 1270, however, when(for whatever reasons) Naakuto Laab was persuaded to abdicate his throne and wasreplaced by Yekuno Amlak – a monarch claiming Solomonic descent. Unlike theZagwes, the very identity of the Solomonids was irrevocably bound up with theArk of the Covenant and with the notion that Menelik I – the founder of theirdynasty – had brought it from Jerusalem during the reign of King Solomonhimself. In this context it is worth remembering that the first written versionof the Kebra Nagast was prepared on the orders of Yekuno Amlak.28[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts28] In other words, although thelegend was by then already very old in oral form,29[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts29] Yekuno Amlak wanted itformalized. Why? Because it served to legitimize and glorify his title to thethrone.From this it follows that Yekuno Amlak would have been horrified by the presencein his country of a body of armed, militant (and technologically advanced)foreigners like the Templars: foreigners who could call on reinforcements fromamongst the thousands of other members of their order in the Near East;foreigners who clearly had a special interest in the Ark and who were possiblyplotting to steal away with it.Assume, however, that Yekuno Amlak (new to the throne and still insecure)initially tried to placate these powerful and dangerous white men, perhaps bygiving them the false impression that he was willing to co-operate with them inmuch the same way as the Zagwes had done. That would have been a logicalstrategy – particularly since it is known that his army was very small30[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts30] – and would explain why nothingspectacular happened during his reign. It would therefore have been up to hissuccessors to seek a final solution to the problem of how to get rid of theTemplars and retain the Ark.Yekuno Amlak’s son (Yagba Zion, 1285–94) was, if anything, even weaker than hisfather in military terms. Yagba Zion, however, was succeeded by a much strongercharacter, Wedem Ara’ad, who reigned until 1314. Significantly it was WedemAra’ad who sent a large embassy to Pope Clement V at Avignon in 1306.Is it not possible that the purpose of that embassy was to stir up trouble forthe Templars – and perhaps to give the Pope and the French king (Philip IV) anurgent motive to destroy the order? Such a motive could have been provided bythe suggestion that the knights were planning to bring the Ark of the Covenantto France. After all, this was a period when deep superstitions ruled thepopular imagination. With so sacred and so powerful a relic in their hands theTemplars would have been in a unique position to challenge both the secular andreligious authorities of the land – and those authorities would certainly havetaken any steps they could to prevent such an eventuality.This theory begins to look particularly attractive when set against the backdropof the arrests of the Templars in France and elsewhere. All these arrests tookplace in 1307 – i.e. about a year after the departure of the Ethiopian missionfrom Avignon. This fits perfectly with what is known about the behaviour of KingPhilip IV: there is evidence that he began to plan his operation against theTemplars about a year in advance of its implementation31[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts31] (i.e. in 1306) and there is alsoevidence that on several occasions during that year he discussed his plans withPope Clement.32 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts32]It would of course be folly to imagine that the destruction of the Templars wasoccasioned only by the lobbying of the Ethiopian envoys. Malice and greed on thepart of Philip IV also played a role (the former because the king had severaltimes been snubbed by the order; the latter because he undoubtedly had his eyeson the huge sums of money resting in Templar treasuries throughout his realm).By the same token, however, it would be folly to imagine that the Ethiopianmission to Avignon in 1306 had nothing to do with the events of 1307. On thecontrary it is more than probable that there was a link – and that link, I amconvinced, was the Ark of the Covenant.PORTUGUESE AND SCOTTISH CONNECTIONSThe Templars were a rich and powerful international brotherhood of religiouswarriors. As such, despite the best efforts of King Philip IV and Pope ClementV, they did not prove easy to destroy. The suppression was most effectively andcompletely implemented in France; even there, however, some brothers managed toevade capture33 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts33] (as did theentire Templar fleet which slipped out of the Atlantic port of La Rochelle onthe morning of the arrests and was never seen again34[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts34]).In other countries the trials and inquisitions were pursued with much lessvigour than in France; nevertheless, tortures, imprisonments, executions,confiscation of property and the final dissolution of the order were the endresult in England (after some considerable delay), in Spain, in Italy, inGermany, in Cyprus and elsewhere.35[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts35]In Portugal and Scotland, however, the Templars appear to have escapedpersecution almost completely. Indeed, circumstances were so favourable in thesecountries that, under different disguises, the order managed to live on in bothof them.At the time when Pope Clement V issued his bull ordering the arrests of theTemplars throughout Christendom – November 1307 – Scotland was locked in afierce struggle to preserve its national independence against the colonialaspirations of England. Leading this struggle was the most famous of all Scotsmonarchs – King Robert the Bruce who, at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314, wasto inflict such a crushing defeat upon the English that his country’s freedomwas guaranteed for centuries afterwards. With all his energies focussed on thewar, Bruce had no interest whatsoever in pursuing the papal vendetta against theTemplars. He therefore only went through the motions of suppressing them: justtwo knights were arrested36 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts36] andthe most that appears to have been required of the remainder was that theyshould keep a low profile.There was method in the Scottish king’s behaviour: all the evidence suggeststhat he granted safe haven not only to local Templars but also to members of theorder fleeing persecution in other lands.37[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts37] Not naturally altruistic, itseems that he adopted this generous policy in order to encourage fugitiveknights to join his army.38 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts38] Ithas, furthermore, been cogently argued that a Templar contingent did fight onBruce’s side at Bannockburn39 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts39] – asuggestion that looks worthy of further research when it is remembered that thevictorious Scots marched behind a tiny Ark-shaped reliquary at that famousbattle.40 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts40]The favour that Bruce showed towards the Templars in Scotland, and the fact thatmany knights escaped arrest in England (because of a delay in implementing thepapal bull there), made it possible for the order to go underground in theBritish Isles – in other words to survive in a secret and hidden form ratherthan to be completely destroyed. For hundreds of years it has been rumoured thatthis secret survival took the form of Freemasonry41[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts41] – a view supported by a specificMasonic tradition that the oldest Scottish lodge (Kilwinning) was founded byKing Robert the Bruce after the battle of Bannockburn ‘for the reception ofthose Knights Templar who had fled from France’.42[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts42] In the eighteenth century AndrewRamsay, a prominent Scots Mason and historian, added credibility to thistradition with a considerable body of work on the connections betweenFreemasonry and the Templars.43 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts43]And at around the same time Baron Carl von Hund, a leading German Mason,declared that ‘Freemasonry originated in Knight Templary, and that, inconsequence, every Mason is a Templar.’44[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts44]That such forthright statements should have been made in the eighteenth century(rather than in any earlier century) is not surprising: this was the period inwhich Freemasons finally ‘came out of the closet’ and began to talk aboutthemselves and about their history.45[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts45] Subsequently, as the new spiritof openness encouraged further research, it became clear that ‘KnightTemplarism’ was and always had been an important force within the Masonicsystem.46 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts46] This research, togetherwith much other material not previously uncovered, has recently beenincorporated into a detailed and authoritative study which itemizes the manyways in which Freemasonry was shaped and influenced by fugitive Templars.47[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts47]It is not my intention here to participate at all in what is undoubtedly aheated, convoluted and highly specialized debate. The point I wish to make issimply that the Masonic system did inherit many of the most central traditionsof the Order of the Temple of Solomon, and that this inheritance was firstpassed on in the British Isles in the years 1307–14 by Templars who had survivedpapal persecution because of the specially favourable conditions then prevailingin Scotland.Nor, as I have already noted, was Scotland the only country in which theTemplars were left unscathed. In Portugal they were tried but found to be freeof guilt, and thus neither tortured nor imprisoned.48[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts48] Of course, as a good Catholic,the Portuguese monarch (Dennis I) could not afford to ignore papal instructionscompletely: accordingly lip service was paid to these instructions and theTemplars were officially dissolved in 1312. Just six years later, however, theywere reborn under a new name: the Militia of Jesus Christ (also known as theKnights of Christ or, more simply, as the Order of Christ).49[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts49]This transformation of one order into another enabled the Portuguese Templarsnot only to survive the fires of the Inquisition during the years 1307 to 1314but also to emerge phoenix-like from the ashes in 1318 – after which date theyseem to have carried on with business very much as usual. All Templar propertiesand funds in Portugal were transferred intact to the Order of Christ, as wereall personnel.50 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts50] Moreover, on 14March 1319, the newly formed entity received the approval and confirmation ofPope John XXII (Clement meanwhile having died).51[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts51]In summary, therefore, despite the harshness of the suppression in France andelsewhere, the Portuguese Order of Christ, and British (and especially Scottish)Freemasonry, were the means by which Templar traditions were preserved andcarried forward into the distant future – perhaps right up to modern times.As my research continued I was to become increasingly sure that one of thetraditions thus perpetuated was the quest for the Ark of the Covenant.‘AFTER BATTLE LIKE WOLVES AND AFTER SLAUGHTER LIKE LIONS …’Even if my theory about the Templars in Ethiopia was correct, I knew that therewas no way that I could establish what might have happened to them in thatcountry after the persecutions began in Europe in 1307. Historical records fromthe reign of Wedem Ara’ad were virtually non-existent. After sending his missionto Avignon, however, my guess was that he would have stayed in touch withdevelopments and would have been informed of the order’s destruction. Secure inthe knowledge that no further knights could now be sent to vex him, the Emperorwould then have moved against those Templars who remained in Ethiopia and eitherexpelled them or wiped them out – most probably the latter.That, at any rate, was my working hypothesis, and probably I would have thoughtno more about this aspect of my investigation if I had not learnt about the‘Portuguese connection’ represented by the Order of Christ. You see, with justtwo unimportant exceptions,52 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts52] allthe known early visitors to Ethiopia were Portuguese. Moreover, this Portugueseinterest in the realm of ‘Prester John’ was already pronounced within a centuryof the destruction of the Templars and was, from the beginning, spearheaded bymembers of the Order of Christ.In this endeavour, the first and most active figure on whom any solidinformation is available was Prince Henry the Navigator, Grand Master of theOrder of Christ and a man described by his biographer as possessing ‘strength ofheart and keenness of mind to a very excellent degree … [who] was, beyondcomparison, ambitious of achieving great and lofty deeds.’53[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts53]Born in 1394, and actively involved in seafaring by 1415,54[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts54] Henry’s greatest ambition – as hehimself declared – was that he would ‘have knowledge of the land of PresterJohn’.55 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts55] Chroniclers who were hiscontemporaries, as well as modern historians, are in full agreement that hedevoted the greater part of his illustrious career to the pursuit of preciselythis goal.56 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts56] Yet an atmosphere ofmystery and intrigue surrounds all his efforts. As Edgar Prestage, the lateCamoens Professor of Portuguese Language, Literature and History at theUniversity of London, observed:Our knowledge of the Henrican voyages is inadequate, and this is largely due tothe adoption of a policy of secrecy which included the suppression offacts … historical works … nautical guides, maps, instructions to navigators andtheir reports.57 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts57]Indeed, so great was the commitment to secrecy in Henry’s time that the releaseof information on the results of the various exploratory voyages that wereundertaken was punishable by death.58[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts58] Despite this, however, it isknown that the prince was obsessed with the notion of making direct contact withEthiopia – and that he sought to achieve this end by circumnavigating Africa(since the shorter route through the Mediterranean and then into the Red Sea viaEgypt was blocked by hostile Muslim forces59[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts59]). Moreover, even before the Capeof Good Hope was rounded, the masters of Portuguese vessels venturing down theWest African coast were instructed to enquire after ‘Prester John’ to seewhether it might not be quicker to approach his kingdom overland.60[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts60]One can only speculate as to the true objective of the Portuguese prince. Thecommon view is that he intended – as a ‘good crusader’61[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts61] – to forge an anti-Islamicalliance with the Christian Ethiopian emperor. Perhaps he did. Since all seriousplans to win the Holy Land for Christendom had been abandoned more than acentury before Henry was born, however, I found it difficult to resist thenotion that he must have had some other motive – some hidden agenda, perhaps,that would have accounted both for his secrecy and for his fascination withPrester John.As I studied the life of the great navigator further I became more and morecertain that this motive was rooted and grounded in his identity as Grand Masterof the Order of Christ, in which capacity he would have inherited all themystical traditions of the Order of the Temple of Solomon. It is notable that heimmersed himself in the study of mathematics and cosmography, ‘the course of theheavens and astrology’,62 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts62] andthat he was constantly surrounded by Jewish doctors and astronomers63[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts63] –men in every way reminiscent ofWolfram’s character Flegetanis who ‘saw hidden secrets in the constellations[and] declared there was a thing called the Gral whose name he read in the starswithout more ado.’64 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts64]Another factor which suggested to me that the Portuguese prince was profoundlyinfluenced by Templar traditions was his celibacy. The Knights of Christ werenot bound by such strict rules as their predecessors in the Order of the Temple.Nevertheless, like the Templar Grand Masters before him, Henry ‘would nevermarry, but preserved great chastity [and] remained a virgin till his death.’65[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts65] Likewise, I could not help butwonder whether it was entirely a matter of coincidence that the illustriousnavigator chose to make his last will and testament on 13 October 146066[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts66] – the 153rd anniversary of thearrests of the Templars in France (which took place on 13 October 1307).Henry died in 1460, shortly after making his will, and it was not until theearly years of the twentieth century that certain secret archives pertaining tothe last decade of his life came to light. Amongst these archives (details ofwhich were published by Dr Jaime Cortezao in 1924 in the review Lusitania67[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts67]) a brief note was found to theeffect that ‘an ambassador of Prester John visited Lisbon eight years beforeHenry’s death’.68 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts68] It is not knownwhat the purpose of this mission was, or what the prince and the Ethiopian envoydiscussed. Nevertheless, two years after their meeting it can hardly have beenaccidental that King Alfonso V of Portugal granted spiritual jurisdiction overEthiopia to the Order of Christ.69[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts69] ‘We are’, admits ProfessorPrestage, ‘still ignorant of the motives that led to this concession.’70[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts70]In the year that Henry the Navigator died – 1460 – a fitting successor was bornat Sines, a seaport in the south of Portugal. That successor, also a Knight ofthe Order of Christ,71 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts71] was Vascoda Gama, who was to open up the Cape route to India in 1497.It is notable that when he set off on this famous voyage da Gama was carryingtwo things: a white silk banner with the double red cross of the Order of Christembroidered upon it; and letters of credence for delivery to Prester John.72[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts72] Moreover, although his ultimatedestination was indeed India, the Portuguese admiral devoted a considerable partof the expedition to African exploration and is reported to have wept for joywhen, at anchor off Mozambique, he was rightly told that Prester John lived inthe interior far to the north.73 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts73]It was also claimed by the same informants that the Ethiopian emperor ‘held manycities along the coast’.74 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts74] Thisclaim was incorrect, but da Gama’s subsequent stop-overs at Malindi, Mombasa,Brava (where he built a lighthouse that still stands) and Mogadishu were in partmotivated by his continuing desire to make contact with Prester John.75[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts75]Meanwhile, in 1487 – a decade before da Gama set off – the Order of Christ hadsponsored a different initiative also aimed at reaching Ethiopia. In that yearKing John II of Portugal, then Grand Master of the Order, had sent his trustedaide Pero de Covilhan on a perilous journey to the court of Prester John via theMediterranean, Egypt and the Red Sea. Disguised as a merchant, Covilhan passedthrough Alexandria and Cairo to Suakin and there, in 1488, he took ship in asmall Arab barque for the Yemeni port of Aden. He then became caught up invarious adventures which delayed him considerably. As a result it was not until1493 that he finally succeeded in entering Abyssinia.76[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts76] Once there, however, he made hisway immediately to the emperor’s court where he was first welcomed but laterplaced under comfortable house arrest. One can only speculate as to why thishappened, but since it is known that Covilhan’s greatest skill was as a spy (hehad previously worked as a secret agent in Spain77[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts77]) it is difficult to resist thenotion that the Order of Christ may have commissioned him to gather intelligenceon the whereabouts of the Ark of the Covenant. Perhaps he aroused suspicion bymaking enquiries about the sacred relic; perhaps not. At any rate he wasdetained in Ethiopia for the rest of his life.78[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts78]Covilhan was still alive when the first official Portuguese embassy to the courtof Prester John landed at the port of Massawa in 1520 and made its way inland tomeet with Lebna Dengel, the Solomonic emperor who had been on the throne since1508. One of the members of this embassy was Father Francisco Alvarez – and thereader will recall that it was Alvarez who had been told by priests of theancient tradition that the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela had been ‘made bywhite men’.79 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts79]I now turned back to the English translation of the lengthy narrative thatAlvarez had written after leaving Ethiopia in 1526. Re-reading his chapter onLalibela I was struck by the description he gave of the church of Saint George.Carved into the roof of this great edifice, he said, was ‘a double cross, thatis, one within the other, like the crosses of the Order of Christ.’80[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts80]Of course, as I already knew, the Lalibela churches had been hewn in the time ofthe Templars, long before the Order of Christ was created to follow in theirfootsteps. It seemed logical to suppose, however, that the cross of the Order ofChrist was derived from a design that would have been significant to theTemplars. It was therefore intriguing to learn that this design had been used onSaint George’s – undoubtedly the finest church in the Lalibela complex. Castingmy mind back to my own visit there in 1983, I could not recall the double crossmotif. I was sufficiently interested, however, to look out the photographs thathad been taken on that trip; these confirmed that the description that Alvarezhad given of Saint George’s was absolutely correct: the double cross was there.In the mid-1520s, while the Portuguese embassy was still at the court of LebnaDengel, it became clear that Ethiopia would soon come under attack from Muslimforces massing in the emirate of Harar in the eastern part of the Horn ofAfrica. These forces were led by a redoubtable and charismatic warlord, AhmedIbn Ibrahim el Ghazi, whose nickname was ‘Gragn’ (meaning ‘the left-handed’).After some years of careful preparations, Gragn eventually declared his holy warin 1528 and led hordes of wild Somali troops (supported by Arab mercenaries andTurkish matchlockmen) on a rampage into the Christian highlands.81[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts81] This turned out to be no briefcampaign but rather continued, year in year out, without any remit. Across thelength and breadth of Ethiopia towns and villages were burnt, churches weredestroyed, priceless treasures were looted, and thousands of people were put tothe sword.82 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts82]Lebna Dengel had been somewhat cool towards the Portuguese. During the six yearsthat their embassy had been in his country (1520–6) he had constantly stressedhis own self-sufficiency, saying, in spite of the Muslim threat (which was veryapparent by 1526), that he saw no point in hastening into an alliance with anyforeign power.83 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts83] This strangelyaloof attitude, I believe, could have been occasioned by concerns as to the truemotives of the European visitors – particularly as regards the Ark of theCovenant.Whatever fears the emperor may have entertained, however, it gradually becameapparent to him that Gragn posed a far greater threat than the white men everwould – and not only to the sacred relic but also to the very existence ofEthiopian Christendom. In 1535 the Muslims attacked Axum and razed to the groundthe ancient and most holy church of Saint Mary of Zion84[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts84] (from which, as I shall recountlater in this chapter, the priests had already taken the Ark to another placefor safekeeping). In 1535, too –and not by coincidence – Lebna Dengel at lastovercame his antipathy towards foreign alliances and sent an envoy to the kingof Portugal with an urgent request for military assistance.85[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts85]Meanwhile communications between Ethiopia and Europe had become much moredifficult (because the Turks had won control of much of the coast of the Horn ofAfrica as well as many of the Red Sea ports). It took a long while for theemperor’s SOS to reach its destination and, in consequence, it was not until1541 that a contingent of 450 Portuguese musketeers landed at Massawa to lendtheir support to the Abyssinian army – which appeared at that point to beutterly beaten and demoralized (Lebna Dengel, after years on the run, had diedof exhaustion and had been succeeded by his son Claudius, then barely out of histeens).86 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts86]Since they were armed with matchlocks, hand-guns, and several pieces of heavyartillery, much hope was pinned upon the intervention of the Portuguese troops.The Ethiopian royal chronicle for 1541 speaks of the confident manner in whichthey marched up into the highlands from the coast, praising them as ‘bold andcourageous men who thirsted after battle like wolves and after slaughter likelions’.87 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts87] Nor did thisdescription overstate their qualities: though small in numbers they fought withinspiring valour and won a series of decisive victories. The British historianEdward Gibbon was later to summarize their achievements in just nine words:‘Ethiopia was saved by four hundred and fifty Portuguese.’88[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts88]Significantly in my opinion, the commander of the relief force was none otherthan Don Christopher da Gama, son of the famous Vasco and, like his father, aKnight of the Order of Christ.89 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts89]James Bruce was inordinately interested in the character of this youngadventurer and described him in the following terms:He was brave to a fault; rash and vehement; jealous of what he thought militaryhonour; and obstinate in his resolutions … [However], in a long catalogue ofvirtues which he possessed to a very eminent degree, [he] had not the smallestclaim to that of patience, so very necessary to those that command armies.90[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts90]I believe that, as a Knight of the Order of Christ, Don Christopher may wellhave had an ulterior motive for his operations in Ethiopia: first he woulddefeat the Muslims; later he would seek out the Ark of the Covenant. Hisrashness and lack of patience, however, were to cost him his life before eitherobjective could be achieved.Despite overwhelming odds, he repeatedly engaged Ahmed Gragn’s forces in battle(on one occasion, deserted by the Abyssinians, the Portuguese faced 10,000spearmen – and beat them). Such feats of derring-do, however, were loaded withrisks and, in 1542, Don Christopher was taken prisoner (an eyewitness describedhow, shortly before his capture, he ‘had been shot in the right knee and wasfighting with his sword in his left hand, for his right arm had been broken byanother shot’91 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts91]).The Portuguese commander was first horribly tortured and then, according toBruce’s account of his last hours, wasbrought into the presence of the Moorish general Gragn, who loaded him withreproaches; to which he replied with such a share of invectives that the Moor,in the violence of his passion, drew his sword and cut off his head with his ownhand.92 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts92]Barely a year later, however, the Muslim leader too was killed. In a battlefought on the shores of Lake Tana on 10 February 1543 he was shot dead by acertain Peter Leon,a man of low stature, but very active and valiant, who had been valet de chambreto Don Christopher … The Moorish army no sooner missed the presence of theirgeneral than, concluding all lost, they fell into confusion and were pursued bythe Portuguese and Abyssinians with a great slaughter till the evening.93[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts93]Thus, after fifteen years of unparalleled destruction and violence, ended theMuslim attempt to subdue the Christian empire of Ethiopia. The costs to thePortuguese relief force were considerable: as well as the redoubtable DonChristopher, more than half of the original contingent of 450 musketeers werekilled in the fighting. Abyssinian casualties, of course, were far greater(running into tens of thousands) and the cultural damage – in terms of burntmanuscripts, icons and paintings, razed churches and looted treasures – was tocast a shadow over the civilization of the highlands for centuries to come.The greatest treasure of all, however, was saved: moved out of Axum by thepriests only days before that city was burnt in 1535, the Ark had been taken toone of the many island-monasteries on Lake Tana. There it was kept in safetyuntil long after Gragn’s death. Then, in the mid 1600s, Emperor Fasilidas(described by Bruce as ‘the greatest king that ever sat upon the Abyssinianthrone’94 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts94]) built a new cathedralof Saint Mary of Zion over the gutted ruins of the old – and there, with dueceremony, the sacred relic was at last re-installed in all its former glory.95[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts95]Fasilidas did one other thing also. Despite the debt of gratitude that hiscountry owed to the Portuguese (whose numbers had been allowed to increasesteadily after the successful conclusion of the war with Gragn) he made it hisbusiness to throw all the settlers out. Indeed, he seemed so wary of theirintentions that he entered into a business arrangement with the Turks atMassawa: any Portuguese travellers arriving there and seeking entry intoEthiopia were to be apprehended and decapitated – with a substantial sum in goldpayable for each head thus obtained.96[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts96]THE SOURCE OF A MYSTERYAfter the death of Don Christopher da Gama the intense and focussed interestthat the Order of Christ had shown in Ethiopia seemed to come to an end. Andafter the reign of Fasilidas there was no longer any way in which that interestcould have been pursued by any Portuguese.However, as noted earlier, the Order of Christ was not the only vehicle in whichTemplar traditions were perpetuated. Scottish Freemasonry, too, inherited someportions of the mystical legacy of the Temple of Solomon – in which the Ark ofthe Covenant played such a central role. Because of this Scottish connection,and because he had claimed to be a distant descendant of the king who hadwelcomed the fugitive Templars in the fourteenth century,97[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts97] I felt that a closerinvestigation was warranted into the activities of one of the most audacious anddetermined foreigners ever to visit Ethiopia: James Bruce of Kinnaird.Standing rather more than six feet four inches tall, and with a girth to match,Bruce was a giant of a man (‘the tallest man you ever saw gratis’, as onecontemporary described him). He was also wealthy and well educated. Born in 1730in the lowlands of Scotland on the family estate at Kinnaird, he was sent at theage of twelve to Harrow school, where his work in the classical languages wasconsidered excellent by his teachers. He later completed his studies atEdinburgh University.A period of illness followed and when he recovered he went to London intendingto take up a job offer with the East India Company. Once there, however, he fellpassionately in love with a beautiful woman named Adriane Allan, whom he marriedin 1753. Soon afterwards he joined his father-in-law’s winetrading business as apartner.Tragedy followed. On a trip to France in 1754 Adriane died suddenly and, thoughhe remarried much later and fathered several children, Bruce seems to have takena long time to recover from the loss of his first wife.Restless and depressed, he began to travel almost continuously, learning newlanguages with great facility wherever he went. His peregrinations took himfirst to Europe, where he fought a duel in Belgium, sailed down the Rhine,inspected Roman ruins in Italy, and studied Arabic manuscripts in Spain andPortugal. Subsequently – after his linguistic ability had been recognized by hisgovernment – he was given a diplomatic posting as British consul in Algiers.From there he later travelled extensively along the North African coast,visiting the ruins of Carthage, before journeying onwards to the Holy Land wherehe explored several other ancient sites. He also found the time to returnoccasionally to Scotland to attend to the family estates of which he was now thelaird, his father having died in 1758.During this period the young Scotsman became something of an astronomer,acquiring two state-of-the art telescopes that subsequently went everywhere withhim. He also picked up surveying and navigational skills that would beinvaluable to him on his travels in Abyssinia.It is not clear exactly when he conceived of this last adventure, but there isevidence that he had been planning it for a considerable while (it is known, forexample, that he had begun to learn Ge’ez, the classical language of Ethiopia,as early as 175998 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts98]). Because ofsuch preparations, which included detailed readings of the works of all previoustravellers, he had accumulated a great deal of background knowledge about thecountry by the time that he arrived in Cairo in 1768 to begin his epic journey.What was it that inspired Bruce to go to Ethiopia? His own account of hismotives is unambiguous: he went, he said, risking ‘numberless dangers andsufferings, the least of which would have overwhelmed me but for the continualgoodness and protection of Providence’, in order to discover the source of theNile.99 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts99] Lest anyone should be inany doubt that this was indeed his ambition he enshrined it conspicuously in thefull title of the immense book that he later wrote: Travels to Discover theSource of the Nile in the Years 1768, 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772 and 1773.There is a mystery here, however, which has attracted the attention of more thanone historian (though no solution has ever been proposed to it).100[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts100] The mystery is this: long beforehe set out for Ethiopia, James Bruce knew that the Blue Nile’s source hadalready been visited and thoroughly explored by two other Europeans: Pedro Paezand Jeronimo Lobo (both of whom were Portuguese priests who had lived inEthiopia in the 1600s before the Fasilidas ban was put into effect).As my research into the Ark of the Covenant progressed during 1989, the mysteryof Bruce’s objectives came to engage my attention more and more. The five heftyvolumes of his Travels had become essential reference works for me because theyprovided a unique picture of Ethiopian culture at a time when that culture wasstill not too far separated from its own archaic origins. Moreover, I knew theScottish adventurer to have been a considerable scholar, and I was impressedfrom the outset by the solid accuracy of his observations and by the generalworth of his judgments and opinions on matters of history. I also regarded himas an honest man, not overly prone to hyperbole, exaggeration ormisrepresentation. How then, I had to ask myself – since it was clear from manyof his own comments that he had carefully read the works of both Paez andLobo101 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts101] – could I account forthe fact that he had failed to give them credit for their achievements?102[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts102] Since I fully agreed with thesubsequent judgment of history (namely that ‘Bruce, far from being a romancer,was a most reliable guide’103 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts103]) Ifound myself increasingly puzzled by his obvious dishonesty over this cruciallyimportant issue – a dishonesty which he compounded with the bald assertion that‘none of the Portuguese … ever saw, or indeed pretended to have seen, the sourceof the Nile’.104 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts104]I was soon to discover that this was not the only matter about which Bruce hadlied. On the subject of the Ark of the Covenant he was even more evasive anddeceitful. Describing his own visit to the sacred city of Axum, he commented onthe destruction by Ahmed Gragn of the first church of Saint Mary of Zion andadded – correctly – that another had now been built in its place:In it [is] supposed to be preserved the Ark of the Covenant … which Menelik … issaid, in their fabulous legends, to have stolen from his father Solomon on hisreturn to Ethiopia … Some ancient copy of the Old Testament, I do believe, wasdeposited here … but whatever this might be, it was destroyed … by Gragn, thoughpretended falsely to subsist there still. This I had from the King himself.105[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts105]In summary, what Bruce appeared to be saying was that the Ark had never beenbrought to Axum (since the story of Menelik and Solomon was just a ‘fabulouslegend’), that the relic once stored in the church could therefore only havebeen ‘some ancient copy of the Old Testament’, and that even this relic nolonger existed since it had been ‘destroyed by Gragn’. These statements werethen backed up with the assertion that they had been corroborated by ‘the Kinghimself’.Had it not been for that last remark I might have been content to believe thatBruce had simply never learned of how the Ark had been saved during the war withthe Muslims, and of how it had later been returned to Axum after the rebuildingof Saint Mary of Zion. The claim that ‘the King himself’ had attested to thedestruction of the relic was patently false, however: in 1690 – long after theGragn campaigns and just eighty years before Bruce’s own visit – an Ethiopianmonarch had entered the Holy of Holies of the new Saint Mary’s where he hadactually seen the Ark (thus confirming its continued existence). The monarch inquestion (Iyasu the Great) had been a priest as well as a king, and because ofthis he had been allowed not only to view the sacred relic but also to open itand gaze inside it.106 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts106] Since itis inconceivable that the king in Bruce’s day would not have known of thisfamous and unprecedented incident, I had to conclude that the Scottish travellerwas once again being ‘economical with the truth’.107[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts107]My conviction that this was so deepened further when I realized – contrary tohis own statement quoted above – that Bruce had not in fact regarded theEthiopian tradition of Menelik, Solomon and the Queen of Sheba as a ‘fabulouslegend’. On the contrary, he had treated it with the utmost respect. In Volume Iof his Travels – some thousand pages before his account of his visit to Axum –he had written at great length about the close cultural and commercialconnections between Ethiopia and the Holy Land in early Old Testament times.108[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts108] Here, amongst other things, hehad unequivocally stated his own view that the Queen of Sheba had been a realhistorical person (rather than a mythical figure),109[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts109] that she had indeed made hervoyage to the court of King Solomon in Jerusalem (‘there can be no doubt of thisexpedition’110 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts110]) and – mostimportant of all – that she had come from Ethiopia rather than from any othercountry: ‘[Others] have thought this Queen was an Arab,’ he concluded,’ ‘[but]many reasons … convince me that she was an Ethiopian.’111[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts111]He next went on to describe as ‘by no means improbable’112[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts112] the account given in the KebraNagast of the queen’s love affair with Solomon and the subsequent birth ofMenelik. In the same vein he then retold the story of Menelik’s own visit toJerusalem and ultimate return to Ethiopia bringing with him ‘a colony of Jews,among whom were many doctors of the law of Moses’.113[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts113] These events, Bruce concluded,had led to ‘the foundation of an Ethiopian monarchy, and the continuation of thesceptre in the tribe of Judah down to this day … first when Jews, then … afterthey had embraced Christianity.’114[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts114]All this was nothing more nor less than a straightforward précis of the KebraNagast in a context that granted it a great deal of weight and historicalauthenticity. Strangely, however, while covering every other major detail, Bruceat this point made absolutely no mention of the Ark of the Covenant – anomission that could only have been deliberate given the central andall-pervasive role played by the sacred relic in the Ethiopian national epic.Once again, therefore, I was forced to conclude that the Scottish traveller hadknowingly misled his readers about the Ark. But why should he have wanted to dothat? What possible motive could he have had? My curiosity aroused, I carefullyre-read his description of Axum and came across an important detail that I hadcompletely overlooked before: his own visit there had taken place on 18 and 19of January 1770.115 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts115]This timing, I suddenly realized, could have been no accident, for on preciselythose two days he would have witnessed the celebration of Timkat, the mostimportant festival of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. During this festival, andat no other time – as I had established when I talked to the guardian-priest in1983 – the Ark of the Covenant was traditionally wrapped in rich brocades (‘toprotect the laity from it’116 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts116])and carried out in procession.117[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts117] Bruce had therefore chosen to bein Axum on the single occasion in the year when, as a layman, he might have hada reasonable opportunity to get close to the sacred relic.I was by now seriously beginning to wonder whether it had not been the Ark allalong that had lured the Scottish traveller to Ethiopia: his claim to have gonethere to find the source of the Nile did not stand up to close scrutiny and boreall the hallmarks of a ‘cover story’ intended to veil the real object of hisquest. Moreover his evasiveness on the subject of the Ark itself was mostpeculiar and really only made sense if he had indeed had a special interest init – an interest that he had wanted to keep secret.Soon I learned other things that deepened my suspicions. I discovered, forexample, that Bruce had been fluent in ancient Hebrew, Aramaic and Syriac118[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts118] – dead languages that he couldhave had no reason to learn unless he had wished to make an intimate study ofearly biblical texts. Moreover, there could be no doubt that he had made such astudy: his knowledge of the Old Testament, which shone out from nearly everypage of the Travels, was described by one scriptural expert as ‘outstanding’.119[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts119]Nor was this the only example of Bruce’s ‘more than common erudition’.120[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts120] As I already knew, he had alsocarried out meticulous and original research into the culture and traditions ofthe black Jews of Ethiopia. ‘I did not’, as he himself had put it, ‘spare myutmost pains in inquiring into the history of this curious people, and lived infriendship with several esteemed the most knowing and learned among them.’121[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts121] Because of such efforts he hadmanaged to make a lasting contribution to the study of Falasha society – acontribution that, like so much else, did not jibe at all with his professedenthusiasm for geographical exploration but that was entirely consistent with aquest for the lost Ark.I telephoned the historian Belai Gedai in Addis Ababa and asked him whether hehad any views on Bruce’s motives. His reply shook me: ‘As a matter of fact whatwe Ethiopians say is that Mr James Bruce did not come to our country to discoverthe source of the Nile. We say that he was just pretending that. We say that hehad another reason.’‘Tell me more,’ I requested. ‘What do you think his objective could have been ifit wasn’t the Nile?’‘The real reason he came was to steal our treasures,’ Gedai said resentfully,‘our cultural treasures. He took many precious manuscripts back to Europe. Thebook of Enoch, for example. Also from the imperial repository at Gondar hecarried off an ancient copy of the Kebra Nagast.’This was news to me – but exciting news if true. I investigated further and indue course confirmed that Gedai was absolutely correct. On leaving EthiopiaBruce had indeed carried the Kebra Nagast with him – and not just the singlesplendid copy taken from the imperial repository but also a copy of that copythat he had made himself (his knowledge of Ge’ez, the classical Ethiopiclanguage, being near-perfect122[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts122]). Much later he gave bothmanuscripts to the Bodleian Library at Oxford, where they remain to this day (as‘Bruce 93’ and ‘Bruce 97’).123 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts123]Nor was this all. Prior to the eighteenth century, scholars had believed thebook of Enoch to be irretrievably lost: composed long before the birth ofChrist,124 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts124] and considered to beone of the most important pieces of Jewish mystical literature, it was onlyknown from fragments and from references to it in other texts. James Brucechanged all this by procuring several copies of the missing work during his stayin Ethiopia. These were the first complete editions of the book of Enoch ever tobe seen in Europe.125 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts125]I was of course interested to discover that Bruce had brought back the KebraNagast to Europe – and that he had also gone to the trouble of copying out theentire massive volume by hand. This made the omission of the Ark of the Covenantin his summary of that work look even more suspicious than I had originallythought. Suspicions are not certainties, however. It was therefore only when Igot the full story of the Book of Enoch, and of the service that the Scottishadventurer had performed for scholarship in this regard, that I finally feltsure that I was on the right track.I learned that the Book of Enoch has always been of great significance toFreemasons, and that certain rituals dating back to long before Bruce’s timeidentified Enoch himself with Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom.126[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts126] I then found a lengthy entry inthe Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia which recorded other relevant traditions of theorder – for example that Enoch was the inventor of writing, ‘that he taught menthe art of building’, and that, before the flood, he ‘feared that the realsecrets would be lost – to prevent which he concealed the Grand Secret, engravenon a white oriental porphyry stone, in the bowels of the earth.’ The entry inthe Cyclcopaedia concluded with these words: ‘The Book of Enoch was known toexist from very ancient times, and is continually alluded to by the fathers ofthe Church. Bruce brought home three copies from Abyssinia.’127[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts127]This brief and familiar mention of Bruce, coupled with the fact that he had goneto such great lengths to obtain not one but three copies of the Book of Enoch,raised the possibility that he might himself have been a Freemason. If so, thena solution to all the puzzles about his evasiveness and dishonesty suggesteditself. I was already convinced that he had a special interest in the Ark of theCovenant – an interest that he had been determined to conceal. Now I could seeexactly how he might have acquired that interest (and why he might have wantedto keep it secret). As a Freemason – and a Scottish Freemason to boot – he couldhave been exposed to the Templar traditions concerning the Ark’s presence inEthiopia.But was Bruce a Mason? Finding the answer to this question was by no means easy.In the more than 3,000 pages of his Travels there was not a single clue thatwould have enabled me even to arrive at an informed opinion on the matter. Norwas any enlightenment shed by the two detailed and extensive biographies thathad been written about him (the first in 1836128[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts128] and the second in 1968129[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts129]).It was not until August 1990 that I was at last able to travel to Scotland tovisit Bruce’s family estate, where I hoped I might be able to obtain somedefinitive information. I found Kinnaird House on the outskirts of the Falkirksuburb of Larbert. Situated well back from the main road in extensive andsecluded grounds, it was an imposing edifice of grey stone. After someunderstandable hesitation, its present owner – Mr John Findlay Russell – invitedme in and showed me around. It was quite obvious from many architecturaldetails, however, that the building did not date back to Bruce’s time.‘That’s quite right,’ Findlay Russell agreed. ‘Kinnaird House passed out of thepossession of the Bruce family in 1895 and was knocked down by its new owner, aDr Robert Orr. He built the present mansion in 1897.’We were standing in an immense panelled hallway directly in front of a broadstone staircase. Findlay Russell now pointed to these stairs and added proudly:‘They’re just about the only original feature to have been preserved. Dr Orrleft them in place and built his house around them. They’re of some historicsignificance you know.’‘Oh, really? Why?’‘Because James Bruce died on them. It was in 1794. He’d been giving a dinner inone of the upstairs rooms and he was escorting a guest down the stairs when hetripped and pitched over on his head. That was the end of him. A great tragedy.’Before leaving I asked Findlay Russell if he had any idea whether Bruce mighthave been a Freemason or not.‘No,’ he said. ‘No idea at all. Of course I take a great interest in him, but Iwouldn’t claim to be an expert.’I nodded, disappointed. As I was walking out of the door, however, anotherquestion occurred to me: ‘Do you happen to know where he’s buried?’‘Larbert Old Church. You’ll have a job finding the tomb though. There used to bea great iron obelisk raised up over it, but that was pulled down some years agobecause it was rusting away. It was considered a danger to the public.’The drive to the church took only ten minutes. Locating the last resting placeof one of Scotland’s greatest explorers took much longer, however.It was a miserable, rainy afternoon and I grew more and more depressed as Ihunted up and down the rows of gravestones. As a personality, there was no doubtthat Bruce had had many failings. Nevertheless, I felt strongly that this braveand enigmatic man deserved some lasting monument: it seemed shameful that heshould have been left to lie in a completely unmarked patch of ground.After I had thoroughly searched the main cemetery and found nothing, I noticed athickly overgrown area surrounded by a low stone wall set into which was a smallgate. I opened this gate and then walked down a flight of three steps whichled … to a rubbish tip. Piles of old clothing, discarded shoes, tin cans andbits of broken furniture lay scattered around amidst dense patches of stingingnettles and brambles. Several massive trees locked branches overhead and theirintertwined leaves formed a dripping green canopy that allowed very little lightto penetrate.Cursing the swarms of midges and wasps that rose up to greet me, I proceeded tostamp down as much of the vegetation as I could. I had looked everywhere else, Ireasoned, so I might as well look here too. I had almost given up hope, however,when finally, in the centre of the enclosure, I stumbled upon several solidstone slabs laid flat on the ground and completely covered with moss, lichen andvile nettles. With a sense of reverence – but also of anger – I cleared theslabs as best I could and gazed down at them. There was nothing to say that theycovered Bruce’s remains but, somehow, I felt sure that they did. Involuntarily alump rose in my throat. Here lay a man – a great man – who had preceded me toEthiopia. Moreover, if my guess about his Masonic connections was correct, thenthere could be little doubt that he had gone to that far country in quest of thelost Ark. Now, however, it seemed that I might never be able to prove thoseconnections. The only thing that was certain was that Bruce was lost himself –lost and forgotten in the land of his birth.I stayed there for a while, thinking my gloomy thoughts. Then I left the littleenclosure, not by the gate through which I had entered it but rather byclambering over the surrounding wall into a courtyard beyond. There, almostimmediately, I saw something interesting: lying on its side quite close to whereI stood was an enormous metal obelisk. I approached and found that James Bruce’sname was engraved upon it, together with the following epitaph:His life was spent performing useful and splendid actions.He explored many distant regions.He discovered the fountains of the Nile.He was an affectionate husband, an indulgent parent,An ardent lover of his country.By the unanimous voice of mankind his name isEnrolled with those who were conspicuousFor genius, for valour, and for virtue.What I found most exciting of all about the obelisk was that it was intact – notrusting and crumbling – and that it was covered with fresh red primer paint.Someone, clearly, was still taking an interest in the explorer – enough of aninterest to have had his monument restored, though not yet set up over his graveagain.Later that afternoon I made enquiries with the church authorities and discoveredthe identity of the mysterious benefactor. It seemed that the obelisk had beentaken away for repairs some years previously and had only been returned toLarbert the day before my own arrival. The restoration work had been organizedand paid for by no lesser person than the titular head of the Bruce family inScotland – the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, himself a Master Mason.130[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts130]This was a promising lead and I followed it all the way to Broomhall, thebeautiful estate just north of the Firth of Forth where Lord Elgin lived. Itelephoned first – the Broomhall number was not ex-directory – and made anappointment for Saturday morning, 4 August.‘I can’t give you more than about fifteen minutes,’ the earl warned.‘Fifteen minutes will be enough,’ I replied.Elgin turned out to be a short, stocky, elderly man with a pronounced limp(apparently the result of injuries received while a prisoner of the Japaneseduring the Second World War). Without much ceremony he ushered me into asplendid drawing room dominated by family portraits and suggested that I getstraight to the point.So far his manner had been a little abrupt. As we talked about Bruce, however,he softened – and it gradually became clear to me from his detailed andextensive knowledge that he had made a close study of the life of the Scottishexplorer. At one stage he took me into another room and showed me severalshelves filled with old and esoteric books in many different languages. ‘Thesewere from Bruce’s personal library,’ he explained. ‘He was a man of very wideinterests … I also have his telescope, his quadrant and his compass … I can lookthem out for you if you like.’While all this was going on, the quarter of an hour I had been promised hadturned into an hour and a half. Spellbound by Elgin’s enthusiasm, I had somehowstill not managed to ask him the question that had brought me here. Now, quitesuddenly, he glanced at his watch and said: ‘Gosh, look at the time. I’m afraidyou’ll have to go. Things to do … I’m off to the Highlands this afternoon.Perhaps you can come back on some other occasion?’‘Er … yes. I’d like that very much.’At this, beaming graciously, the earl stood up. I stood too and we shook hands.I felt distinctly foolish but I was determined not to leave without satisfyingmy curiosity.‘If you don’t mind,’ I said, ‘there’s one other thing I particularly wanted toask you. It’s to do with a theory I’ve been developing about the motives thatled Bruce to make his expedition to Ethiopia. Do you happen toknow … er … um … I mean is there any chance, any possibility at all, that hemight have been a Freemason?’Elgin looked slightly amazed. ‘My dear boy,’ he replied. ‘Of course he was aMason. It was a very, very important part of his life.’"},{"pageContent":"PART III: ETHIOPIA, 1989–90LABYRINTH"},{"pageContent":"[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_m03_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8INTO ETHIOPIAOn my visit to his estate in Scotland, the Earl of Elgin confirmed that mysuspicions about James Bruce were correct: the explorer had indeed been aFreemason (a member of Canongate Kilwinning Lodge No. 2 in the city ofEdinburgh).Elgin also told me that Bruce had been very much involved in the ‘speculative’side of Freemasonry – as distinct from the more pragmatic and mundane ‘craft’Masonry. This meant that he would have cultivated an interest in the esotericand occult traditions of the brotherhood – traditions, including ‘KnightTemplarism’, that most modern Masons neither knew nor cared anything about.I should add, at this point, that I had never felt that all Masons would havehad access to the Templar legacy; on the contrary, it was reasonable to supposethat such access would at all times have been restricted to a very few people.Bruce, however, looked like an ideal candidate for membership of that privilegedgroup. With his extensive knowledge of the Scriptures, his scholarly attractionto mystical works such as the Book of Enoch, and his ‘speculative’ leaningswithin the Masonic system, he was precisely the kind of man who would haveinvestigated Templar traditions concerning the last resting place of the Ark ofthe Covenant.After my meeting with Lord Elgin, therefore, I felt more confident than everthat it had been the Ark all along, rather than the Nile, that had lured theScottish adventurer to Ethiopia in 1768. His paradoxical dishonesty on certainkey issues (paradoxical because he was normally so truthful) now made sense tome; his evasiveness and secrecy were now explained. I might never know whatmysteries he had uncovered in the Abyssinian highlands all those many years ago;now, however, I could at least be reasonably sure about his motives.It had been in the summer of 1989 when I had first begun to wonder whether Brucemight have been a Mason, but it was not until August 1990 that I had mydiscussion with Lord Elgin. Meanwhile, as recounted in the last chapter, I hadfollowed up the ‘Portuguese connection’ represented by members of the Order ofChrist who had travelled to Ethiopia in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.All the evidence that I had unearthed seemed to point in the direction of acontinuing quest for the Ark – a covert venture that had drawn travellershailing from quite different historical periods and from different lands towardsthe same lofty and enduring goal. Moreover, if this had been the case incenturies past then might it not still be the case today? Might not others beseeking the Ark in Ethiopia just as I was? As my research progressed I kept anopen mind on this question while continually adding to my files on people likeJames Bruce and Christopher da Gama. Even without the stimulus of competition,however, my findings during the spring and summer of 1989 had convinced me thatit was high time for me to return to Ethiopia to add some detailed field work towhat had hitherto been primarily an intellectual exercise.DIFFICULT TIMESI took this decision as early as June 1989, but several months were to elapsebefore I was finally able to implement it. Why? Because on 19 May of that year aviolent coup had been attempted in Addis Ababa throwing the whole of Ethiopiainto turmoil.The government of President Mengistu Haile-Mariam survived, but only at greatcost. After the dust had settled one hundred and seventy-six rebellious officerswere rounded up and arrested, including no less than twenty-four generals,amongst them the Commander of Ground Forces and the Chief of Operations. Ratherthan be captured and face trial, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff and theCommander of the Air Force committed suicide. Eleven other generals were killedin the fighting and the Minister of Defence was shot dead by the coup plotters.The consequences of this ugly bloodbath were to haunt Mengistu and his regimefor a very long while to come: with the officer corps effectively gutted, themilitary’s decision-making capacity was reduced virtually to zero, a state ofaffairs that quickly translated itself into reverses on the battlefield. Indeed,in the months immediately following the coup, the Ethiopian army suffered aseries of crushing defeats that ended in its total expulsion from the provinceof Tigray (which the TPLF declared a ‘liberated zone’) and from most of Eritreaas well (where the EPLF was already laying in place the structures for anindependent state). The fighting also spread with alarming rapidity into otherareas – including north-east Wollo, where the ancient city of Lalibela wasoverrun in September 1989, and Gondar, where the regional capital was besieged.The worst setback of all, at least from my own selfish perspective, was that thegovernment was no longer in control of Axum. Indeed, as noted in Chapter 3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c03_r1.htm], the sacred city had been seized by theTPLF at the end of 1988, some months before the attempted coup. I had at firsthoped that this would be a temporary state of affairs. As the dismal events ofthe second half of 1989 began to unfold, however, I had to face up to thepossibility that the guerillas might be able to hold on to Axum indefinitely.This, of course, left me with the option of approaching the TPLF in London andtrying to win their co-operation in getting into the areas that they nowadministered. I was, however, not ready to pursue this option immediately. Myown long-standing connections with the Ethiopian government meant that theLiberation Front would regard any overtures from me with intense suspicion. Onepossible outcome, unless I played my cards very cleverly indeed, was that theywould point-blank refuse my request to go to Axum. But frankly I was moreconcerned about the safety of my skin if they did agree to take me in: as aknown friend of the hated Mengistu regime wasn’t there a chance, on the long anddangerous road into Tigray, that some local guerilla commander might decide Iwas a spy and have me shot – even if the London office had cleared me for thevisit?In the post-coup atmosphere nothing could be certain in Ethiopia; no plans couldbe made with any degree of confidence; and there was no way of predicting whatmight happen from one week to the next. Any number of dramatic developmentslooked theoretically possible – not least the fall of Mengistu and a completevictory for the combined forces of the EPLF and the TPLF. I decided, therefore,that I would focus my efforts on other aspects of my research until a clearerpicture had emerged. It was thus not until November 1989 that I finally returnedto Ethiopia.A SECRET HIDING PLACE?The information that precipited my return was provided to me by the VeryReverend Liqa Berhanat Solomon Gabre Selassie. I first encountered the man whoowned this extremely long name in London on 12 June 1989, at which time Idiscovered that he also had an extremely long and full grey beard, nut-brownskin, twinkling eyes, splendid ceremonial robes, and – suspended around his neck– an elaborate wooden crucifix. Archpriest of the Saint Mary of Zion EthiopianOrthodox Church in the United Kingdom, he was, in fact, a missionary. He hadbeen sent to Britain some years previously by the Patriarchate in Addis Ababa inorder to spread the Orthodox message. Moreover he had succeeded in winning anumber of converts, mainly young Londoners of West Indian origin, some of whomhe brought with him to our meeting – which I had arranged in order to pump himfor information about the Ark.Archpriest Solomon was, for me, the very image of an Old Testament patriarch.The venerable beard, the sagacious and yet slightly roguish manner, thecharismatic personality leavened with genuine humility, and the absoluteconviction of a deeply held faith all added irresistibly to this impression.It quickly became clear to me as we talked that he possessed an unshakablebelief that the sacred relic was indeed in Ethiopia. An intelligent andobviously highly educated man who spouted out biblical references with anassurance born of a lifetime of study, he expressed this view firmly and calmlyand refused to accept that there was any possibility at all that he might bemistaken.On a sheet of paper in front of me I took careful notes as he forcefullyreiterated this point: the original Ark of the Covenant which had beenconstructed at the foot of Mount Sinai to contain the tablets of stone bearingthe Ten Commandments – that very same pure and authentic object now rested inAxum. Furthermore, he insisted, it still had ‘its powers, thanks to the Grace ofGod’ and was, in addition, ‘protected by the entire population of Tigray’. ‘Itremains today’, he concluded, ‘in the safe hands of the church and Christianpeople who are constantly seen around the church’s compound.’Before the archpriest left, I wrote down a list of fifteen questions that Iwanted him to answer in detail. When his considered replies arrived at my homeby post in mid-July, however, I was far away in Egypt. On my return some weekslater I barely glanced at the ten pages of mixed handwriting and typescript thathe had sent me. Indeed I was so busy analysing and working through the Egyptianmaterial I had gathered that I didn’t even bother to send him a note of thanks.In an idle moment in early November I finally turned my attention to thedocument which I had placed in the ‘pending’ tray on my desk more than threemonths previously. I found that it contained point-by-point responses to all myfifteen questions. Some of the answers, furthermore, were both intriguing andprovocative.For example, I had asked whether the alleged ‘supernatural’ powers of the Arkhad ever been harnessed by the rulers of Ethiopia to bring victory in war. TheBible made it clear that this had been done on several occasions in ancientIsrael.1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts1] If the Ark was really inEthiopia, therefore, wasn’t it logical to suppose that this tradition would havebeen maintained?‘In the teaching of our Church’, Solomon had replied, ‘God is the only power inthe universe. He is the creator of all existing life, visible and invisible. Hehimself is the uncreated eternal light, which gives us light and power andgrace. There is, however, a tangible dimension in which we can understand therelation between God and the Ark, for since the Ark contains the ten sacredwords of the Law, written by God, the gift of His holiness cannot be diminishedwithin it. Up to this day, therefore, His grace still rests upon the Ark, so bythe name of God it is holy and of great spiritual significance.’The former rulers of Ethiopia, the archpriest’s answer continued, had knownthis. Since their prime function was to protect and defend the OrthodoxChristian faith they had, during the many wars fought over the passingcenturies, made use of the Ark from time to time ‘as a source of spiritualstrength against the aggressors … The King would rally the people for battle andthe priests would stand as on the day when Joshua carried the Ark around thecity of Jericho. Likewise our priests carried the Ark, chanting and going intobattle in the glory of God.’This use of the sacred relic as a war palladium – and as an effective one atthat – was not, according to Archpriest Solomon, just something that hadhappened in Ethiopia’s distant past. On the contrary: ‘As recently as 1896 whenthe King of Kings Menelik the Second fought against the Italian aggressors atthe battle of Adowa in Tigray region, the priests carried the Ark of theCovenant into the field to confront the invaders. As a result of this, Menelikwas very victorious and returned to Addis Ababa in great honour.’I re-read this part of the reply with considerable interest because I knew thatMenelik II had indeed been ‘very victorious’ in 1896. In that year, under thecommand of General Baratieri, 17,700 Italian troops equipped with heavyartillery and the latest weapons had marched up into the Abyssinian highlandsfrom the Eritrean coastal strip intent on colonizing the whole country.Menelik’s forces, though ill prepared and less well armed, had met them at Adowaon the morning of 1 March, winning in less than six hours what one historian hadsubsequently described as ‘the most notable victory of an African over aEuropean army since the time of Hannibal’.2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts2] In a similar tone, the LondonSpectator of 7 March 1896 commented: ‘The Italians have suffered a greatdisaster … greater than has ever occurred to white men in Africa.’The tantalizing hint that the Ark had been used at Adowa raised in my mind thehalf-serious possibility that it might still be being used today – perhaps bythe TPLF, who now had control of Axum and who, like Menelik II, had certainlybeen very victorious in recent months. Solomon, however, did not speculate aboutthis in his written answers. Instead (in his reply to a question that I hadasked concerning the security of the Ark in the sanctuary chapel during thecurrent all-out war being fought between government and rebel forces) he went onto suggest a completely different scenario.When I had talked to him in June he had seemed confident that the sacred relicwas still in its usual place, ‘protected by the entire population of Tigray’.Now he did not seem so sure. ‘There have been very infrequent occasions’, heexplained, ‘during periods of great violence and tribulation, when the guardianmonk, who watches the Ark day and night until he dies, has been obliged to coverit up and bring it out of Axum to safety. We know, for instance, that thishappened in the sixteenth century when Tigray was invaded by the Muslim armiesof Ahmed Gragn and most of Axum was destroyed. Then the guardian took the Ark tothe monastery of Daga Stephanos, which stands on an island in Lake Tana. Thereit was hidden in a secret place.’It was the archpriest’s conclusion that really caused me to sit up and payattention. Under the present circumstances of war and chaos in Tigray, he said,it was quite possible that the guardian could have taken the Ark out of Axumagain.TWO LAKES, TWO ISLANDSI flew back to Addis Ababa on Tuesday 14 November 1989, arriving on the morningof Wednesday 15 November. Despite the continuing fighting in almost all parts ofnorthern Ethiopia, I was quite clear in my own mind about the objectives of thistrip. If Archpriest Solomon’s analysis was correct, I reasoned, might not thesacred relic believed to be the Ark of the Covenant be resting even now on themonastic island of Daga Stephanos – in that same ‘secret place’ to which it hadbeen taken in the sixteenth century?This, furthermore, was not the only location in which it might have beenconcealed. I also remembered very well that Dr Belai Gedai had told me in one ofour several long-distance telephone conversations of another, earlier traditionconcerning the saving of the Ark during the uprising of Queen Gudit in the tenthcentury. At the time, the Ethiopian historian had explained, it had been broughtto one of the islands on Lake Zwai.I had therefore come to Ethiopia to check out both Lake Tana and Lake Zwai: theformer lying in the war-torn north, though still in an area controlled by thegovernment; the latter in safer territory about two hours’ drive to the south ofAddis Ababa.I felt a tremendous sense of urgency during my first few days in the Ethiopiancapital. I had left England less than a week after reading Archpriest Solomon’sanswers to my questions, and the reason why I was in such a hurry was quitesimple: though Lake Zwai was secure enough, for the present at least, there wasabsolutely no guarantee that Lake Tana was going to remain in government handsfor very much longer. Rebel forces, I knew, had surrounded the fortress city ofGondar, which stood some thirty miles to the north of the vast lake. Meanwhile,sporadic artillery and hit-and-run attacks had also been directed against theport of Bahar Dar on the southern shore. Since the only way for me to reach DagaStephanos was through Bahar Dar I felt that I had no time to lose.There could be no question of going through the normal bureaucratic channels toarrange the internal travel permit. Accompanied by my old friend RichardPankhurst, who had taken a few days off from the Institute of Ethiopian Studiesin order to help me out, I therefore went along to a meeting with one of myhighest-ranking contacts – Shimelis Mazengia, Head of Ideology and a seniormember of the ruling Politburo of the Workers’ Party of Ethiopia.A tall slim man in his forties who spoke fluent English, Shimelis was acommitted Marxist but also one of the most intelligent and cultured of thePolitburo members. His power within the regime was considerable and I knew himto have a genuine enthusiasm for the ancient history of his country. I thereforehoped that he might be persuaded to use his influence to back the research thatI wanted to do – and in this I was not disappointed. After I had outlined myproject to him he agreed readily to my proposed field trips to Lake Tana and toLake Zwai. The only condition was that my stay in the Tana area should be keptas short as possible. ‘Do you have a schedule in mind?’ he asked.I pulled out my diary and, after a moment’s thought, proposed Monday the 20thfor my departure to Lake Tana: ‘I’ll fly to Bahar Dar, hire a launch from theMaritime Authority, visit Daga Stephanos and then come back to Addis on – say –Wednesday the 22nd. That should give me enough time … If it’s OK with you I’dthen like to drive down to Zwai on Thursday the 23rd.’Shimelis turned to Richard: ‘And will you be going as well, ProfessorPankhurst?’‘Well, if it is acceptable … of course I would like very much to go.’‘Certainly it is acceptable.’Shimelis then telephoned the Headquarters of the National Security Police inAddis Ababa and spoke rapidly in Amharic to someone in authority. After he hadhung up he told us that our permits would be ready for collection thatafternoon.‘Come back and see me next Friday,’ he said, ‘after you have finished at LakeTana and Lake Zwai. You can make an appointment with my secretary.’We left the Party building in high spirits. ‘I never thought it would be soeasy,’ I said to Richard."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9SACRED LAKEThe morning flight from Addis Ababa to Bahar Dar on the southern shore of LakeTana took about an hour and a half. Despite the fighting reported in the area,no special procedures were observed during the landing, and the plane made alow, slow, scenic approach over the Blue Nile Falls before touching down on thebumpy gravel strip. From there, after hiring a taxi, Richard Pankhurst and Imotored the few remaining kilometres into town along roads lined with jacarandaand flame trees.We checked into two of the hundred empty rooms at the Tana Hotel on the lake’sedge and then drove to the Maritime Authority pier where the motor launch thatwe hoped to use was moored. After protracted negotiations with the officialsconcerned it was eventually agreed that we could charter the boat – but notuntil the next day, Tuesday 21 November, and then only if we were prepared topay the piratical hire of 50 US dollars an hour. Since I had no other choice Igrudgingly accepted this extortionate figure and asked that the vessel should bemade ready for a 5 a.m. departure.With time to kill that afternoon we drove out of Bahar Dar to the nearby villageof Tissisat and then hiked through tawny countryside overlaid with a patchworkof fields until we came to a massive stone bridge thrown across a steep gorge.Built by the Portuguese in the early seventeenth century, this crumbling edificelooked highly dangerous; Richard assured me, however, that it was stillserviceable. We crossed it, and climbed a hillside – at the top of which twomilitiamen suddenly appeared out of a clump of shrubbery. They searched us,looked at our passports (classically, mine was examined upside down) and thenwaved us on.Fifteen minutes later, after negotiating a narrow goat-track lined with thicktropical shrubbery and yellow daisies, we began to sense a low, thunderingvibration underfoot. We walked on, aware of an increasing dampness in the air,and in a short while caught a first glimpse of what we had come to see – thespectacular basalt cliff over which, with tremendous power, the Blue Nile hurlsitself before embarking on its epic journey out of the Abyssinian highlands.The local name for the Blue Nile Falls, and for the village through which onemust approach them, is Tissisat, meaning ‘water that smokes’. As I stoodenraptured, gazing at the rainbows playing amongst the fine spumes of spraythrown high into the air by the boiling cataract, I could well understand why.I was also reminded – and struck by the accuracy – of the description given bythe Scottish explorer James Bruce after his visit here in 1770:The river … fell in one sheet of water, without any interval, above half anEnglish mile in breadth, with a force and a noise that was truly terrible, andwhich stunned and made me, for a time, perfectly dizzy. A thick fume, or haze,covered the fall all around, and hung over the course of the stream both aboveand below, marking its track, though the water was not seen … It was a mostmagnificent sight, that ages, added to the greatest length of human life, wouldnot deface or eradicate from my memory; it struck me with a kind of stupor, anda total oblivion of where I was, and of every other sublunary concern.1[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts1]Ethiopia, I reflected, was a country in which time really could stand still:there was nothing at all, in the scene now laid out before me, which suggestedthat more than two centuries had elapsed since Bruce had been here. Not for thelast time I felt a deep sense of empathy with the Scottish traveller whosefamily name I happened by coincidence to share (through the maternal line – mygrandmother was born a Bruce, and Bruce, too, is my own middle name).Later, surrounded by crowds of local children who had materialized from nowherein order to demand money, pens and sweets, Richard and I set off on the walkback towards Tissisat village. Thus far there had been something almostidyllically peaceful and rustic about the afternoon; even the militiamen who hadsearched us earlier had done so lethargically and with good humour. Now,however, as we re-crossed the Portuguese bridge with the first chill of eveningsetting in, we were confronted by an incongruous and jarring spectacle: at leastthree hundred heavily armed soldiers dressed in green battle fatigues advancingtowards us from the other direction.It was impossible to be sure whether we were looking at government or rebeltroops. They wore no regimental insignia, nor any other identifyingparaphernalia. Neither did they appear to be disciplined or even under thecommand of an officer: rather than being organized into a discernible marchingorder they slouched oafishly along with angry and resentful glares. I alsonoticed that a number of the men were carrying their weapons very sloppily: oneused his rifle as a walking stick; another held an AK-47 barrel-forwards acrosshis shoulder; a third was loosely waving a loaded rocket launcher which, iffired accidentally, could have demolished a fair-sized building – or, for thatmatter, the bridge we were all standing on.Richard, whose Amharic is better than mine, greeted several individual membersof this surly rabble in a familiar manner, shook hands heartily with perhaps adozen more, and made eccentric gestures of friendship towards most of the rest.‘They think all foreigners are slightly mad,’ he explained to me in a stagewhisper. I’m just living up to the stereotype. Believe me, it’s the best thingto do.’THE JEWEL OF ETHIOPIAThe next morning we arrived at the Maritime Authority pier at 5 a.m. There wasno sign of activity and Richard, who was wrapped in a blanket against the cold,muttered something about the ‘maambfak syndrome’.‘What’s that?’ I asked.‘Many appointments are made but few are kept,’ the historian grumbled.Within half an hour, however, the captain of the MV Dahlak had arrived. So toohad a clean-shaven young man in a well cut suit who introduced himself asWondemu and informed us, with great humility, that he was the SecondDeputy-Assistant Regional Administrator: ‘Yesterday afternoon my boss received aphone call from Comrade Shimelis Mazengia in Addis telling him that we shouldlook after you. I immediately reported to your hotel but you were not present.Then from Reception I learned about this research you are conducting today. So,’he concluded with a broad smile, ‘here I am.’By 5.45, shivering in the dawn chill, we were on the water and making goodheadway towards Daga Stephanos some twenty miles to the north. Above themountains ringing the eastern shore of the huge lake the sun was already rising.A fresh breeze carried the sounds of birdsong and of barking dogs.Before too long Richard and Wondemu disappeared into the cabin to chat and drinktea. Entranced by the view, by the invigorating Alpine quality of the air, andby the romance of travel, I remained on deck gazing out at the ever-shiftinglacustrine panorama and fretting subliminally about exactly how much this littlepleasure cruise was going to cost me. To reach Daga, the captain had said, wouldtake about two and a half hours. Since we would need to be on the island for atleast that long and would then require a further two and a half hours to getback, it looked like I was going to end up shelling out almost 400 dollars.I was interrupted in this slightly depressing piece of mental arithmetic by thestriking spectacle of two native long boats with high, curved prows pulling outtowards us from the distant shore. Silhouetted in the pink light of the earlysun I could discern five or six men crouched down inside each vessel wieldingpaddles which, in unison, they raised and dipped into the water, raised anddipped, raised and dipped.Known as tankwas, I remembered from my previous visit in 1983 that local craftsuch as these were a common sight on Lake Tana. The two now running brieflyparallel to us, but heading in the opposite direction, were much larger than anythat I had seen before. Nevertheless they were clearly of the same basic design,being made of bundles of papyrus reeds bound together.Having spent a considerable fraction of the previous few months studyingarchaeological sites in Egypt I was now able to confirm with my own eyessomething which I knew that several historians had already observed – namelythat the Ethiopian tankwas bore an uncanny resemblance to the reed boats used bythe Pharaohs for transportation, hunting and fishing on the Nile.2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts2] I had seen representations ofhigh-prowed vessels just like these in frescoes decorating the tombs in theValley of the Kings and also in reliefs carved into the temple walls at Karnakand Luxor.Not for the first time I found myself wondering whether the ancient Egyptianshad ever visited the Tana area. It was not just the similarity in boat design,suggestive as it was of a strong cultural influence, that led me to thisspeculation, but also the lake’s importance as the principal reservoir of theBlue Nile.Tana is not itself officially regarded as the source of that great river,identified as twin springs, in the mountains to the south, that were visited byBruce and by other travellers before him.3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts3] At these springs rises a riverknown as the ‘Little Abai’ which flows across the southern edge of the lake(there is a discernible current) and then out again as the ‘Big Abai’, the localname for the Blue Nile.To all intents and purposes, however, as geographers and engineers now accept,4[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts4] the Blue Nile’s real source isLake Tana, which is fed not only by the ‘Little Abai’ but also by many otherrivers, thus draining a huge expanse of the Abyssinian highlands. Indeed, with asurface area of 3,673 square kilometres, this vast inland sea provides anestimated six-sevenths of the total volume of water in the combined streams ofthe Blue and the White Niles.5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts5]Most important of all, it is Ethiopia’s long rainy season – which causes averitable flood to race out of Lake Tana and along the Blue Nile – that has beenresponsible since time immemorial for the annual inundation that brings silt andfertility to Egypt’s Delta. By comparison the longer White Nile – which losesmore than half of its volume in the swamplands of southern Sudan – contributesalmost nothing.6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts6]As I sat watching the papyrus-reed tankwas, therefore, it seemed to meinconceivable that the priests of Karnak and Luxor – who worshipped the Nile asa life-giving force and also, symbolically, as a blessed god – would not at somestage in their long history have made their way to Ethiopia. There were norecords to prove this, just another hunch; but nevertheless, in the numinousdawn glow of that November morning, I felt confident that the ancient Egyptiansmust at some point have visited Tana – and venerated it.Certainly the Greek geographer Strabo, who lived around the time of Christ andwho was deeply versed in Egyptian learning, was aware (as later scholars werenot) that the Blue Nile rose in a giant lake in Ethiopia, a lake which he called‘Pseboe’.7 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts7] In the second centuryAD the Egyptian geographer Claudius Ptolemy expressed a similar opinion,although the name that he gave to Tana was ‘Coloe’.8[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts8] I also thought that the Atheniandramatist Aeschylus might have been inspired by more than just poetic fancy whenhe wrote hauntingly in the fifth century BC of ‘a copper-tinted lake … that isthe jewel of Ethiopia, where the all-pervading sun returns again and again toplunge his immortal form, and finds a solace for his weary round in gentleripples that are but a warm caress.’9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts9]These, I knew, were not the only references linking the mysterious waters ofLake Tana to the ancient cultures of Greece, Egypt and the Middle East. As I saton the deck of the MV Dahlak en route to Daga Stephanos I also remembered thatthe Abyssinians themselves firmly believed the Blue Nile to be nothing less thanthe Gihon of Genesis 2:13 – ‘the second river’ that ‘compasseth the whole landof Ethiopia’. This, furthermore, was a very old tradition,10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts10] almost certainly pre-Christian,and thus added considerable weight to the notion that the lake, together withits rivers and islands, might indeed have some genuine connection with the Arkof the Covenant.It was therefore with a certain flush of optimism that I looked ahead, acrossthe intervening miles, to the green slopes of Daga island rising above theshining waters like the peak of some submerged mountain.DAGA STEPHANOSIt was around 8.30 when we finally moored at Daga. The sun was now high in thesky and, despite the altitude (Tana stands more than 6,000 feet above sealevel), the morning was hot, humid and breathless.We were met on the wooden jetty by a delegation of monks dressed inastonishingly dirty robes. They had obviously been monitoring our approach forsome time but did not appear to be in the least bit pleased to see us. Wondemuhad a word with them and eventually, with obvious reluctance, they led usthrough a small banana plantation and then up a steep, winding path towards thesummit of the island.As we walked I stripped off the pullover I had been wearing, stretched my armsand took a few deep breaths. The track that we were following passed through themidst of a dense forest of tall gnarled trees, the leaves of which formed acanopy above us. The air was laden with the loamy scent of freshly turned earthand with the fragrance of tropical flowers. Bees and other large insects buzzedindustriously about and, in the distance, I could hear the monotonous ringing ofa traditional stone bell.Eventually, some 300 feet above the surface of the lake, we began to come acrosslow round buildings with thatched roofs – the dwellings of the monks. Next wepassed under an arch set into a high stone wall and finally entered a grassyclearing at the centre of which stood the church of Saint Stephanos. This was along rectangular structure, curved at the ends, with a covered walkway extendingall around it.‘Doesn’t look all that old,’ I said to Richard.‘It isn’t,’ he replied. ‘The original building was burnt down in a grass fireabout a hundred years ago.’‘I suppose that would have been the one that they brought the Ark to in thesixteenth century?’‘Yes. In fact there’s probably been some sort of church on this site for atleast a thousand years. Maybe even for longer than that. Daga is reckoned to beone of the holiest places on Lake Tana. Because of that the mummified bodies offive former emperors are kept here.’Wondemu, in his self-appointed role as our guide and interlocutor, had beentalking quietly to some of the monks. Now he detached one member of the group –whose vestments were slightly cleaner than those of his fellows – and led him bythe hand towards us. ‘This,’ he announced proudly, ‘is Archpriest Kifle-MariamMengist. He will answer all your questions.’The archpriest, however, seemed to have ideas of his own on this subject. Hiswrinkled, prune-like features registered a curious mixture of hostility,resentment and greed. In silence he sized Richard and me up, then turned toWondemu and whispered something in Amharic.‘All …,’ sighed our guide, ‘I am afraid he wants money. It is to purchasecandles, incense and … er … other necessary church items.’‘How much?’ I asked.‘Whatever you feel is appropriate.’I proposed 10 Ethiopian birr – about 5 US dollars – but Kifle-Mariam indicatedthat this sum was not sufficient. Indeed, he declared, the proffered note was solacking in the quality of sufficiency that he could not even bring himself todetach it from my fingers.‘I think you should pay more,’ Wondemu hissed politely in my ear.‘I’ll be happy to do that, of course,’ I said. ‘But I’d like to know what I’llbe getting in return.’‘In return he will talk to you. Otherwise he says he has much to do.’We settled, after further debate, on 30 birr. The money was quickly folded andconjured away in some noisome fold or pouch in the priestly robes. Then westrolled over to the arcade surrounding the church and sat down in the shadebeneath the overhanging eaves of the thatched roof. Several of the other monksfollowed us and lurked about looking self-consciously contemplative andpretending not to listen to our conversation.Kifle-Mariam Mengist began by telling us that he had been on the island foreighteen years and had become an expert on all matters concerning the monastery.As though to prove this point he then launched into a kind of potted history –which went on, and on, and on.‘Right,’ I interrupted after Wondemu had given me the drift of this boringspeech. ‘I do want to get a general picture. But first I’d like to ask thearchpriest a specific question – which is this: I’ve heard it said that the Arkof the Covenant was brought here in the sixteenth century when Axum was attackedby the armies of Ahmed Gragn. Does he know this story? And is it true?’Fifteen or twenty minutes of incomprehensible argument followed, at the end ofwhich Wondemu announced that the priest definitely did not know the story.Moreover, since he did not know it, he was not able to tell us whether it wastrue or not.I tried a different tack. ‘Do they have a tabot of their own? Here. Inside thischurch?’ Through the open doorway behind us I pointed expressively towards theentrance of the Holy of Holies, which was just visible in the gloom within.After another Amharic question-and-answer session Wondemu announced: ‘Yes. Ofcourse they have their tabot.’‘Good. Well I’m glad we’ve established that at any rate. Now, ask him this: doeshe accept that their tabot is a copy – a replica – of the original tabot inAxum?’‘Perhaps,’ came the enigmatic reply.‘I see. OK. Well in that case I’d like you to ask him whether he knows anythingat all about the Ark of the Covenant. How it came to Axum. Who brought it.Things like that. Get him to tell us the story in his own words.’An immediate and perfunctory response was given to this question. ‘He says hedoes not know the story,’ Wondemu translated rather mournfully. ‘He says he isnot an authority on such matters.’‘Is there anyone else who is?’ I asked in exasperation‘No. Kifle-Mariam Mengist is the senior priest on the island. If he does notknow then it is impossible that anyone else will know.’I looked at Richard: ‘What’s going on here? I’ve never, never ever, met anEthiopian priest who didn’t know the Kebra Nagast story about the Ark.’The historian shrugged: ‘Nor have I. It’s very peculiar. Perhaps you shouldoffer him … a further inducement.’I groaned. It always came down to money in the end, didn’t it? If a few morebirr was what it would take to get this tight-lipped old bastard talking,however, then it would be best to pay up quickly. After all, I’d come all theway from London to check Daga Stephanos out – and even now the MV Dahlak wasmoored at the jetty with its meter running at the rate of approximately a dollara minute. With grim resignation I passed over another small handful of crumplednotes.This latest act of generosity, however, did me absolutely no good at all. Thepriest had nothing further to say on any subject of interest. When this hadfinally sunk in – and it took some time – I leaned back against one of thepillars that supported the roof, inspected my fingernails, and tried to decidewhat to do next.There were, I realized, two possible explanations for the apparent ignorance ofKifle-Mariam Mengist. One, the least likely, was that the man was genuinelystupid. The other, more probable by far, was that he was lying.But why should he lie? Well, I reasoned, there were two possible explanationsfor that as well. The first – and the least likely – was that he had somethingimportant to hide. The second – more probable by far – was that he wanted toextract further notes from my rapidly diminishing wad of Ethiopian currency.I stood up and said to Wondemu: ‘Ask him again. Ask him if the Ark of theCovenant was brought here from Axum in the sixteenth century … and ask himwhether it’s here now. Tell him I’ll make it worth his while if he’ll show it tome.’Our guide raised a quizzical eyebrow. What I had just proposed was not in goodtaste. ‘Go on,’ I urged. ‘Just ask him.’More Amharic, then this from Wondemu: ‘He says the same as before. He does notknow about the Ark of the Covenant. But he also says that nothing has beenbrought to Daga Stephanos from outside for a very long time.’The group of monks who had been standing in a semi-circle eavesdropping on myconversation with Kifle-Mariam Mengist dispersed at this point. One of them,however – barefoot, toothless and dressed in such poor rags that he would havepassed for a beggar on any street in Addis Ababa – accompanied us as we walkedback down the steep track to the jetty. Before we climbed on board the launch hepulled Wondemu aside and whispered something in his ear.‘What was that?’ I asked sharply, expecting a further demand for payment of somekind.Money, however, turned out not to be the issue this time. Wondemu frowned: ‘Hesays that we should go to Tana Kirkos. Apparently we will learn something aboutthe Ark there … something important.’‘What’s Tana Kirkos?’‘It is another island … east of here. Quite far.’‘Ask him to tell us more. What does he mean by something important?’Wondemu put the question again and translated the answer. ‘He says that the Arkof the Covenant is on Tana Kirkos. That is all he knows.’My first reaction to this astonishing piece of news was to roll my eyesheavenwards, tug distractedly at my hair, and kick the side of the launch.Meanwhile the monk, whom I wanted more information from, had hobbled back alongthe jetty and vanished into the banana grove.I looked at my watch. It was now almost noon. We had been out of Bahar Dar forsix hours, or 300 dollars.‘Is Tana Kirkos on our way back?’ I asked Wondemu.‘No,’ he replied, ‘I have never been there. No one ever goes there. But I knowit is more or less due east. Bahar Dar is south.’‘I see. Any idea how long it will take us?’‘No. I shall ask the captain.’Wondemu did that. It would take us about an hour and a half.‘And after that, how long back to Bahar Dar?’‘About three more hours.’I did some rapid calculations in my head. Say two hours on Tana Kirkos, plus anhour and a half to get there, plus three hours to Bahar Dar … that’s six and ahalf hours. Call it seven, plus the six we’ve already had. That’s, let’s see,thirteen hours. Thirteen bloody hours! At fifty bucks an hour. Six hundred andfifty dollars minimum. Christ!I fulminated inwardly for some time longer. Eventually, however – with a heartas heavy as my wallet was light – I made up my mind to go.Of course the Ark wouldn’t actually be on Tana Kirkos. I knew that. In fact themost likely scenario was that I would be given the run-around again, just as onDaga Stephanos. Money would be extracted from me in dribs and drabs until thepoint was reached where I was obviously not prepared to hand over any more. Thenanother tantalizing little hint would be dropped naming yet another island – andoff I would go, banknotes at the ready, to enrich yet another community of needyanchorites.James Bruce, I remembered, had been to Tana in the eighteenth century. ‘Thereare forty-five inhabited islands in the lake,’ he had written, ‘if you believethe Abyssinians, who, in everything, are very great liars …’11[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts11]TANA KIRKOSI was not in a receptive frame of mind when we arrived at Tana Kirkos.Nevertheless, as I stood in the bows of the MV Dahlak scowling at the islandahead, I had to admit that it was a beautiful and unusual place. Completelycovered in dense green shrubbery, flowering trees and tall cactus plants, itrose steeply from the water to a high peak on which I could just make out thethatched roof of a circular dwelling. Hummingbirds, kingfishers and bright bluestarlings darted through the air. On the shore of a small sandy bay, on amakeshift jetty, stood a group of monks. Smiling.We dropped anchor and clambered out of the boat. Wondemu did the usual round ofintroductions and explanations. Hands were shaken. Lengthy greetings wereexchanged. Finally we were led up a narrow, overgrown path cut out of the sideof a grey cliff, through an archway at the top – again hewn out of the barestone – and finally into a clearing containing three or four dilapidatedbuildings and a dozen ragged monks.Set back behind natural rock walls, the grassy space in which we stood wasenclosed, silent and dark. The light that did penetrate, filtered as it wasthrough the overarching trees and bushes, seemed muted and green. Against mybetter judgment, I began to suspect that there might be something worth seeinghere after all. I could not have explained why, but Tana Kirkos felt ‘right’ ina way that Daga Stephanos had not.The senior priest now arrived and introduced himself, through Wondemu, as MemhirFisseha. He was lean and smelled of incense. He did not ask for money, but hedid ask whether or not we had security clearance.I was nonplussed by such a question, coming as it did from a traditional figurein clerical robes.‘As a matter of fact,’ I said, ‘yes we do.’ I pulled from my pocket the permitwe had obtained from the security police in Addis and gave this to Wondemu, whoin turn passed it to Memhir Fisseha. The old man – were all priests in Ethiopiaso old? – studied the document with an abstracted air and then handed it back tome. He seemed to be satisfied.Wondemu now explained that I wanted to ask some questions about Tana Kirkos andabout the Ark of the Covenant. Would that be OK?‘Yes,’ the priest replied, rather sadly I thought. He directed us to the doorwayof what, from the blackened pots and pans lying inside, appeared to be akitchen. Here, on a small stool, he sat down, indicating that we should joinhim.‘Do you believe,’ I began, ‘that the Ark of the Covenant was brought fromJerusalem to Ethiopia by Emperor Menelik I?’‘Yes,’ Wondemu translated.I heaved a sigh of relief. This was already much better than Daga Stephanos.‘I have heard a story’, I continued, ‘that the Ark is now here – on the islandof Tana Kirkos. Is that story true?’An anguished expression crossed Memhir Fisseha’s leathery face as he answered:‘It was true.’Was true? What on earth did that signify? ‘Get him to elaborate,’ I barked atWondemu in some agitation. ‘What does he mean by was true?’The priest’s response excited and distressed me in roughly equal measure: ‘Itwas true. But the Ark of the Covenant is not here any longer. It has been takento Axum.’‘Taken back to Axum!’ I exclaimed. ‘When? When did they take it?’An intense discussion followed in Amharic, with the main point obviously beingclarified several times. Finally Wondemu translated: ‘The Ark was taken to Axumone thousand six hundred years ago, in the time of King Ezana. It was not takenback. It was simply taken there, and it has stayed there ever since.’I felt perplexed and frustrated. ‘Let me get this clear,’ I said after amoment’s thought. ‘He’s not telling us that the Ark was here recently and hasnow gone back to Axum, is he? He’s telling us that it went there a very longtime ago.’‘Exactly. One thousand six hundred years ago. That is what he says.’‘OK, then ask him this. How did the Ark get here in the first place? Did it comehere from Axum, and then go back there? Or was it here before it was ever takento Axum? That seems to be what he means, but I want to be absolutely sure.’Slowly and painfully the story emerged. Extracting it was like extracting thestump of a rotten tooth from an inflamed gum. Several times consultation wasrequired with the other monks and once a huge, leather-bound book written inancient Ge’ez was referred to and a passage read out.In summary, what Memhir Fisseha told us was that the Ark had been stolen fromthe Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem by Menelik I and his companions. They hadbrought it out of Israel, he explained, and into Egypt. Then they had followedthe Nile – first the Nile and afterwards its tributary the Takazze – until theyhad reached Ethiopia.This, of course, was the tradition of the theft of the Ark reported in the KebraNagast. What came next, however, was completely new.Looking for somewhere safe and appropriate where they might install the preciousrelic, the old priest continued, the travellers had come to Tana. At that time,he said, the entire lake was sacred. It was dear to God. A holy place. So theyhad come to Tana, to its eastern shore, and they had chosen this island, nowcalled Kirkos, as the resting place for the Ark.‘How long did it stay here?’ I asked.‘For eight hundred years,’ came the reply. ‘It blessed us with its presence foreight hundred years.’‘Was there a building? Was it put into some sort of temple?’‘There was no building. The Holy Ark was placed inside a tent. And it stayedwithin that tent, here on Tana Kirkos, for eight hundred years. We were Jewsthen. Afterwards, when we became Christians, King Ezana took the Ark to Axum andplaced it in the great church in that city.’‘And you say the Ark was taken to Axum one thousand six hundred years ago?’‘Yes.’‘So if it was on Tana Kirkos for eight hundred years before that, then – let’ssee – it must have arrived here something like two thousand four hundred yearsago. Is that right? Are you telling me it came here about four hundred yearsbefore the birth of Christ?’‘Yes.’‘You do know that 400 BC was a long time after Solomon – who was supposed to beMenelik’s father? In fact Solomon would have been dead for about five centuriesby then. What do you say to that?’‘I say nothing. I have told you our tradition as it is recorded in our sacredbooks and in our memory.’A remark that the priest had made a few moments earlier had interested meenormously, and I now picked him up on this: ‘You told me that you were Jewsthen? What did that mean? What kind of religion did you have?’‘We were Jews. We performed sacrifice … the sacrificial lamb. And we continuedwith this practice until the Ark was taken from us to Axum. Then Abba Salamacame and he taught us the Christian faith, and we built a church here.’Abba Salama, I knew, was the Ethiopic name for Frumentius, the Syrian bishop whohad converted King Ezana and the entire Axumite kingdom to Christianity in the330s AD. This meant that the periods of time that Memhir Fisseha had given memade sense – or at least were internally consistent. The only contradiction wasthe huge gap between the known dates for Solomon – mid 900s BC – and the datethat the Ark had supposedly been brought to Tana Kirkos (which, if I subtractedeight hundred years from 330 AD, would have been 470 BC).I pressed on: ‘Before Abba Salama came and taught you Christianity you had nochurch here?’‘No church. I told you. We were Jews. We performed sacrifice.’ He paused, thenadded: ‘The blood from the lamb was collected in a bowl … a gomer. Then it wasscattered over some stones, some small stones. They are here still, up to thisday.’‘Sorry. Come again. What are here to this day?’‘The stones that we used for sacrifice when we were Jews. Those stones are here.On the island. They are here now.’‘Can we see them?’ I asked. I felt a tiny thrill of excitement. If what MemhirFisseha had just said was true, then he was talking about physical evidence –real physical evidence to support the strange but curiously convincing storythat he had told.‘You can see them,’ he replied. He got to his feet. ‘Follow me. I will showyou.’SCATTERING THE BLOODThe priest led us to a high point on the cliff edge near the summit of theisland, overlooking Lake Tana. Here, on a raised plinth made of natural unhewnrock, he showed us three short stone pillars grouped closely together. Thetallest of the three – perhaps a metre and a half high – was square in section,with a cup-shaped declivity hollowed out in its top. The remaining two were eachabout a metre high, circular in section, and as thick as a man’s thigh. At thetop they also had been hollowed out to a depth of approximately 10 centimetres.Though copious quantities of green lichen grew on them I was able to establishthat the three pillars were all monoliths, that they were freestanding, and thatthey had been carved from the same type of grey granite. They looked old, and Iasked Richard for his opinion on this.‘Of course,’ he replied, ‘I’m not an archaeologist. But I would say from the waythey are cut, the style – particularly the square one … I would say they are atleast from the Axumite period, if not earlier.’I asked Memhir Fisseha what the cup-shaped declivities were for.‘To contain blood,’ was his answer. ‘After the sacrifice, some was scatteredover the stones and some on to the tent that contained the Ark. The remainderwas poured into these hollows.’‘Can you show me how it was done?’The old priest beckoned one of the other monks and gave him an instruction in alow voice. He strode off and returned a few minutes later carrying a wide butshallow bowl so corroded and tarnished with age that I could not even guess ofwhat metal it was made. This, we were told, was the gomer in which thesacrificial blood was first collected.‘What exactly does gomer mean?’ I asked Wondemu.He shrugged: ‘I don’t know. It is not an Amharic word, nor Tigrigna. It does notsound like it belongs to any Ethiopian language.’I looked to Richard for enlightenment but he confessed that he was not familiarwith the word either.Memhir Fisseha said simply that it was called a gomer and had always been calleda gomer and that was all he knew. He then positioned himself next to the stoneswith the bowl in his left hand, dipped into it with his right forefinger, swepthis right hand above the level of his head and commenced an up-and-down motion.‘The blood was scattered in this way,’ he said, ‘over the stones and over thetent of the Ark. Afterwards, as I told you, what was left was poured thus.’ Hethen tipped the bowl sideways above the cup-shaped hollows in the tops of thepillars.I asked the priest if he knew where exactly on the island the Ark had been keptin its tent. All he would say, however, was ‘near here … somewhere near here’.I then sought clarification of our earlier discussion: ‘You told me that it wastaken from Tana Kirkos to Axum one thousand six hundred years ago. Is thatcorrect?’Wondemu translated the question. Memhir Fisseha nodded affirmatively.‘OK,’ I continued. ‘Now what I want to know is this: has it ever been broughtback here? At any time, for any reason, has the Ark ever come back to thisisland?’‘No. It was taken to Axum and it stayed in Axum.’‘And as far as you are aware it is still there to this day?’‘Yes.’No further information seemed likely to be forthcoming, but I was more thansatisfied with what I had got – particularly since the information given had atno point been bartered for money. Grateful for this I handed over a 100 birrnote as a voluntary contribution to the monastery’s expenses. Then, with MemhirFisseha’s permission, I set about photographing the sacrificial pillars from avariety of different angles.We were back in Bahar Dar shortly before eight that evening. We had been out andabout on Lake Tana for more than fourteen hours and the final bill for the hireof the MV Dahlak came to 750 US dollars.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_035_r1.jpg]36 The Blue Nile Falls near Lake Tana, Ethiopia.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_036_r1.jpg]37 Papyrus-reed boat on Lake Tana.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_037_r1.jpg]38 Hollowed stones on the island of Tana Kirkos, said to have been used tocontain blood during sacrifices in the presence of the Ark of the Covenant.

I no longer begrudged the expense,however. Indeed, the doubts that had beset me so forcefully on Daga Stephanoshad been completely banished by Tana Kirkos and I felt that I could now continuethe quest with a renewed sense of commitment and optimism.This positive mood received a further boost back in Addis Ababa. There, before Iset out for the planned trip to Lake Zwai on Thursday 23 November, I had theopportunity to visit the University Library and examine a number of referencesconcerning the use of sacrificial stones in Old Testament Judaism.What I discovered was that pillars similar to those that I had seen on TanaKirkos had been associated with the very earliest phases of the religion – bothin Sinai and in Palestine. Known as masseboth, they were set up as altars onhigh places and were used for cultic and sacrificial purposes.12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts12]I then looked in the Bible to see if I could find any specific detailsconcerning the proper performance of sacrifices in Old Testament times. I didfind such details and, as I read and re-read the relevant passages, I realizedthat what Memhir Fisseha had described to me on the island had been an authenticand very ancient ceremony. No doubt much had become muddled and confused in thememories of the tradition that had been handed down from generation togeneration. When he had talked about the scattering of blood, however, he hadbeen astonishingly close to the mark.In Chapter 4 of the book of Leviticus, for example, I came across this verse:‘And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the bloodseven times before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary.’13[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts13] Likewise in Chapter 5 I read:‘And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of thealtar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of thealtar.’14 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts14]It was not until I turned to the Mishnah, however, the compilation in writtenform of early oral Jewish law, that I realized just how authentic MemhirFisseha’s account in fact had been. In the tractate known as Yoma, in the seconddivision of the Mishnah, I found detailed descriptions of the sacrificialrituals carried out by the High Priest within Solomon’s Temple in front of thecurtain that shielded the Ark of the Covenant from the gaze of the laity.I read that the blood of the victim – whether lamb, goat, or bullock – wascollected in a basin and given ‘to one that should stir it up … so that itshould not congeal’. Then the priest, having emerged from the sanctuary, ‘tookthe blood from him that was stirring it and entered again into the place wherehe had entered and stood again on the place whereon he had stood, and sprinkledthe blood once upwards and seven times downwards.’15[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts15]And where, exactly, did the priest sprinkle this blood? According to the Mishnahhe sprinkled it ‘on the curtain outside, opposite the Ark, once upwards andseven times downwards, not as though he intended to sprinkle upwards ordownwards, but as though he were wielding a whip … He then sprinkled thecleansed surface of the altar seven times and poured out the residue of theblood.’16 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts16]It seemed to me highly improbable that Memhir Fisseha had ever read the Mishnah.As a Christian he would have no reason to do so; nor would he have had access tosuch a book on his remote island; nor could he have understood any of thelanguages into which it had been translated. Yet his hand movements, when he hadshown me how the scattering of the blood was done, had been precisely those of aman wielding a whip. And he had spoken confidently of the blood being poured notonly upon the altar stones but also ‘on the tent of the Ark’.The correspondences were too close to be ignored and I felt sure that at sometime in the distant past an object of great religious significance had beenbrought by Jews to the island of Tana Kirkos. Despite the chronologicalinconsistency in the supposed date of its arrival, there was also every reasonto suppose – as Memhir Fisseha himself had so obviously believed – that thatobject might indeed have been the Holy Ark of the Covenant."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10GHOST IN A MAZEDuring the discussions on Tana Kirkos a comment that the priest had made to mejust before he had got to his main point had aroused my curiosity. That comment– the implications of which I now wanted to investigate further in the libraryat the Institute of Ethiopian Studies – had been to do with the route that theArk had followed on its journey to Ethiopia. After being stolen from the Templeof Solomon in Jerusalem, the priest had said, it had first been carried intoEgypt and from there had been brought to Lake Tana by way of the Nile and theTakazze rivers. Despite all the research that I had done during the previous fewmonths, I realized that I had never given serious consideration to the questionof Menelik’s itinerary. I therefore wanted to see what the Kebra Nagast had tosay on the matter. I also wanted to know if there was anything in it thatspecifically contradicted the priest’s assertion that the Ark had spent eighthundred years at Tana Kirkos before being taken to Axum.The only relevant information that I could find in the great epic was containedin Chapter 84. There it was reported that Menelik and his travelling companionshad brought the sacred relic to a place called Debra Makeda after their arrivalin Ethiopia.1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts1] To my surprise therewas no mention of Axum whatsoever. ‘Debra Makeda’, wherever it might have been,was clearly and unambiguously highlighted as the Ark’s first home in Ethiopia.At a stroke this cleared up one of the more serious factual inconsistencies thathad bothered me since 1983 – namely that the city of Axum had not been foundeduntil about eight hundred years after the date of Menelik’s supposed journey.2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts2] Several of my original informantshad told me that Axum had been the final destination of that journey and thatthe Ark had been lodged there from the outset3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts3] – which, of course, would havebeen historically impossible. Now, however, I could see that the Kebra Nagastmade no such claim and said only that Menelik and his companions had brought therelic from Jerusalem to ‘Debra Makeda’. I knew that the word ‘debra’ meant‘mountain’ and that ‘Makeda’ was the name given in Ethiopian tradition to theQueen of Sheba. ‘Debra Makeda’ therefore meant ‘Mount Makeda’ – the Queen ofSheba’s mountain.In the Kebra Nagast’s brief description I saw nothing to suggest that this‘Queen of Sheba’s Mountain’ might actually have been Tana Kirkos. By the sametoken, however, I could find nothing that ruled that possibility out. Seekingfurther clues I then referred to an authoritative geographical survey of LakeTana carried out in the 1930s and learned that ‘Kirkos’ was a name that had beengiven to the island in relatively recent times (in honour of a Christian saint).‘Before the conversion of Ethiopia to Christianity,’ the survey added, ‘TanaKirkos was called Debra Sehel.’4 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts4]The obvious question immediately formed itself in my mind: what, exactly, didSehel mean?To find out I consulted several of the scholars who were then studying in thelibrary. They told me that it was a Ge’ez word rooted in the verb ‘to forgive’.‘Would I be right’, I asked, ‘in assuming that a correct translation of the fullname Debra Sehel would be something like “Mount of Forgiveness”?’‘Yes,’ they replied. ‘That is correct.’Now this was interesting. In Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzival, as I rememberedvery well, the location of the Grail castle – and of the Grail Temple – wasgiven as Munsalvaesche.5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts5] There hadbeen some debate over the exact interpretation of this word Munsalvaesche; morethan one Wolfram expert, however, had suggested that behind it lay ‘the biblicalMons Salvationis, Mount of Salvation’.6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts6]There could be no doubt that the notions of ‘forgiveness’ and ‘salvation’ werelinked – since in order to be ‘saved’, in the religious sense, one must first be‘forgiven’. Moreover, as Psalm 130 puts it: ‘If thou, Lord, shouldest markiniquities … who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee … Let Israelhope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteousredemption.’7 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts7]‘Redemption’ is, of course, a close synonym for ‘salvation’.8[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts8] I therefore could not help butwonder whether Wolfram’s ‘Mount of Salvation’ might not in some way have beenassociated with Ethiopia’s ‘Mount of Forgiveness’ – now known as Tana Kirkos.I was fully aware that speculation of this kind could only ever be tenuous andthat it was a long jump indeed from Debra Sehel to Munsalvaesche. Nevertheless,after my many readings of Parzival, I could hardly forget that the mysticalGrail Temple (‘smooth and rounded as though from a lathe’9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts9]) had stood on a lake – and quitepossibly on an island on that lake.10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts10] Nor did it seem entirelyirrelevant that Ethiopian Orthodox churches and Falasha places of worship weretraditionally circular in shape11 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts11]– as were the majority of Templar churches (including several still standing tothis day such as the twelfth-century Temple Church off London’s Fleet Street). Itherefore felt that there were certain correspondences in all of this which itmight be unwise for me to ignore entirely (though it would be equally unwise toread too much into them).Meanwhile there was another and rather less tentative link to consider – thatbetween Debra Sehel and Debra Makeda. As the former name of Tana Kirkos madeclear, Ethiopian islands could acquire the prefix Debra (meaning ‘Mount’). And,indeed – rising steeply to a high peak that towered above the surface of thelake – Tana Kirkos had looked to me very much like a mountain when I had firstset eyes on it. This certainly did not prove that the Kebra Nagast had beenreferring to Debra Sehel when it had spoken of the Ark being taken to the Queenof Sheba’s mountain. I reasoned, however, that it did at least elevate theisland to the status of a candidate for that distinction.With this established, I moved on to consider the question of the route thatMenelik and his companions had followed on their journey. Previously I hadalways assumed that the travellers had gone by ship – from Solomon’s port ofEziongeber (modern Elat on the Gulf of Aqaba),12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts12] and thence down the Red Sea tothe Ethiopian coast. Now, as I pored over the copy of the Kebra Nagast providedto me by the librarian, I discovered that my earlier assumption had been quitewrong. Menelik’s long journey from Jerusalem had involved a substantial caravanand had been overland throughout.13[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts13]But what overland route had been followed? The description of the trek given inthe Kebra Nagast had the dreamlike, miraculous and surreal quality ofimaginative storytelling, in which recognizable place names and geographicalfeatures were not easy to find. Nevertheless there were some details that wereboth specific and important. After leaving Jerusalem the travellers had firstmade their way to Gaza (on Israel’s Mediterranean coast, where a city of thatname still exists). From there, presumably following the well established traderoute across the northern edge of the Sinai peninsula,14[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts14] they had crossed into Egyptwhere, not long afterwards, they had arrived at a great river: ‘Let us let downthe wagons,’ they said at this point, ‘for we have come to the water ofEthiopia. This is the Takazze which floweth down from Ethiopia and watereth thevalley of Egypt.’15 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts15] It was clearfrom the context that Menelik and his companions were still in ‘the valley ofEgypt’ when they uttered these words – and probably not far south of the site ofmodern Cairo. The river beside which they had let down their wagons couldtherefore only have been the Nile. What was striking, however, was that they hadimmediately identified it with the Takazze – the same great Ethiopian tributarythat the priest had mentioned to me on Tana Kirkos.From the librarian I obtained an atlas and traced the Takazze’s course with myfingertip. I found that it rose in Abyssinia’s central highlands not far fromthe ancient town of Lalibela, took a winding path in a north-westerly directionthrough the Simien mountains, merged with the Atbara in the Sudan, and finallyjoined the Nile proper some hundreds of miles to the north of the modern city ofKhartoum (which stands at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles).Looking at the map I could immediately see two other things: first that the Nile– from an Ethiopian perspective – might easily have come to be regarded as anextension of the Takazze;16 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts16]secondly that it would have been entirely sensible for the caravan carrying theArk of the Covenant to have followed the Nile and then the Takazze in order toreach Ethiopia. The alternative would have been to proceed much furthersouthwards through the hostile deserts of the Sudan as far as the confluence ofthe two Niles and then to follow the Blue Nile into the highlands. However –since the latter river makes a wide curving detour to the south before turningnorth again towards Lake Tana – this would have required an unnecessarilylengthy expedition; the Takazze route, by contrast, was the best part of athousand miles shorter.The map made something else clear as well: a group of travellers following theTakazze to its headwaters would, near the end of their journey, have reached apoint less than seventy miles from the eastern shore of Lake Tana. And TanaKirkos lay not far off that same eastern shore. There was thus no mysterysurrounding the tradition that the little island had been the first restingplace of the Ark in Ethiopia: indeed, casting around for somewhere safe andclose to install the sacred relic, Menelik and his companions could hardly havemade a better choice.THREE MEN IN A BOATThe next morning when Richard Pankhurst and I travelled to Lake Zwai we wereaccompanied by an old friend of mine, Yohannes Berhanu, the General Manager ofthe state-owned National Tour Operation. The three of us met up just before 6a.m. at the NTO offices, where Yohannes had thoughtfully provided achauffeur-driven Toyota Landcruiser. Twenty minutes later we had left the slumsand skyscrapers of Addis Ababa behind and were rumbling along the broad highwaythat led south through the town of Debra Zeit into the heart of the Great RiftValley.Discounting the Koka reservoir, which is man-made, Lake Zwai is the northernmostof Ethiopia’s string of Rift Valley lakes. It has a surface area of some twohundred square miles and a maximum depth of about fifty feet. Oval in shape, itis studded with islands and has marshy shores overgrown with reeds that providean ideal habitat for storks, pelicans, wild ducks, geese and fish eagles – aswell as for great numbers of hippopotami.Our destination, after the two-hour drive from Addis Ababa, was a jetty on thesouthern side of the lake. Here we had been told that the Ministry of Fisheriesowned and operated a number of boats, one of which would surely be provided forus at minimal cost. Predictably, however, all the larger vessels had gonefishing. Only a single small motorboat was available – and there was no fuel forits outboard engine.A lengthy palaver followed with the Ministry staff who explained that themotorboat wasn’t really big enough to take Richard, Yohannes and me as well as apilot. Debra Zion, the island to which I had been told that the Ark had beenbrought for safekeeping in the tenth century, was distant: at least a three-hourjourney in this humble craft. Furthermore, with no deck to shelter under, wewould be grievously afflicted by the sun. Perhaps, therefore, we would care tocome back tomorrow when more suitable transport could be arranged?Yohannes vehemently declined this suggestion. Professor Pankhurst and MrHancock, he said, had important appointments in Addis Ababa tomorrow –appointments which could not under any circumstances be altered. We must,therefore, reach Debra Zion today.More discussions followed and eventually we trooped along the jetty and satexperimentally in the tiny motorboat. Arranged around its sides we did more orless fit into it, although our combined weight forced it rather low in thewater.What to do? The Fisheries officials seemed dubious but at last agreed to let ushave our way. The vessel was ours. They would provide a pilot. And there wouldbe no charge. We, however, would have to arrange for the fuel ourselves. Perhapswe could send our driver into the nearest town with a jerrycan?We did this. A vast and completely inexplicable delay then ensued. One hourpassed. Then another. Growing impatient I stood at the end of the jetty and madethe acquaintance of several marabou storks: huge, lugubrious, long-beaked,bald-headed birds obviously descended from pterodactyls. Finally our driverreturned with the necessary fuel and – just after 11 a.m. – we started up theoutboard motor and set off.We puttered, very slowly, through the rippling waters, passing one denselywooded island, then another. The reed-fringed shoreline receded and thendisappeared behind us, there was no sign of Debra Zion, the sun was now directlyoverhead, and the boat was leaking in a small but noticeable way.At this point Yohannes Berhanu rather pointedly reminded us that the lake wasfull of hippopotami (which he described as ‘very aggressive and untrustworthyanimals’). He was, I observed, wearing a life-jacket that he must somehow haveacquired before our departure from the jetty. Meanwhile, Richard Pankhurst’snose was turning an interesting shade of lobster pink. And I … well I wasgritting my teeth and trying to ignore the implications of an increasingly fullbladder. Where was that bloody island? And when exactly were we going to getthere? I looked impatiently at my watch and was suddenly overtaken by a faintbut definite sense of the ridiculous. I mean, Raiders of the Lost Ark was onething but this, to be honest, was more like Three Men in a Boat.The journey to Debra Zion did not take as long as we had been told it would;nevertheless it took quite long enough and I was the first on to dry land whenwe finally arrived. I dashed past the delegation of monks waiting to greet us,disappeared behind the nearest bush and emerged again some minutes later feelingvery much better.When I rejoined the others, who were deep in conversation with the welcomingcommittee, I noticed a number of papyrusreed boats lined up along the shore.They seemed identical in every respect to those I had seen on Lake Tana. I wason the point of asking about this when Yohannes interrupted my chain of thoughtby announcing excitedly: ‘Graham. There is something strange here. It seems thatthe mother-tongue of these people is Tigrigna.’This was strange indeed. We were now in the southern part of the province ofShoa, an Amharic-speaking area. Tigrigna, on the other hand, was the language ofthe sacred city of Axum and of the province of Tigray – hundreds of miles to thenorth. I knew from direct experience that Ethiopia was a country in whichregional distinctions, particularly linguistic distinctions, had very profoundimplications (profound enough, anyway, to lead to civil war). It was thereforemost surprising to find that Amharic was not the first language of the monks ofDebra Zion.Nor, as it turned out, did this peculiarity apply only to the monks. We quicklyestablished that every inhabitant of the island, including the farmers and thefishermen, routinely conversed in a dialect of Tigrigna and only used Amharic(which many of them did not speak at all well) on the rare occasions when theywere visited by government officials.As we hiked up the winding path to the top of the hill where Debra Zion’s mainchurch was sited I asked: ‘How come you all speak Tigrigna?’‘Because our forefathers came from Tigray,’ the monks replied through the mediumof Yohannes.‘When did they come?’‘It was around one thousand and thirty years ago.’I did some quick mental arithmetic. One thousand and thirty years from 1989 gavea date of AD 959. The tenth century, I thought. The century in which Queen Gudithad overthrown the Solomonic dynasty and in which the Ark of the Covenant hadsupposedly been taken out of Axum and brought to Debra Zion for safekeeping.Without really having begun to interview anybody it was already beginning tolook very much as though the tradition reported to me by Belai Gedai had somesubstance to it.‘Why did they come?’ I asked next. ‘Get them to tell us the story of how and whythey came here.’Yohannes put this to the monks and then translated their answer: ‘You see, theirforefathers came here with the tabot. It was in the time of Gudit. She attackedthe Christians in Tigray. There was much fighting. They were escaping from her.And they came here with the tabot.’‘Which tabot?’‘They say it was the tabot from the Church of Saint Mary of Zion in Axum.’‘By that do they mean the original tabot that was brought by Menelik fromJerusalem to Ethiopia? The Ark of the Covenant in other words. Or do they havesome other tabot in mind? I want to be absolutely clear on this point.’Yohannes manfully plunged into this minefield of interpretation while we carriedon walking up the steep hill. Much argument and debate followed before hefinally commented: ‘I do not think they are very clear themselves. But they saythat it is written … that it is all written in a book, kept here in the church,and that we should discuss the whole matter with their senior priest.’STOLEN HISTORYFive minutes later we arrived at the church which, I was not entirely surprisedto discover, was dedicated to Saint Mary of Zion. It was a plain andunpretentious wattle-and-daub building, whitewashed on the outside andsurmounted by a simple cross. The view that it commanded from its position onthe hilltop was, however, superb, giving us some idea of the extent of thislarge island. Behind us, from the direction we had come, the path wound backthrough fields dotted with the poor huts of peasant farmers. Ahead of us theland sloped steeply away to the lake’s edge through a forest of acacia trees andcactus.The senior priest, Abba Gebra Christos, now presented himself. A small wiry man,probably in his late sixties, he wore a thin grey beard and a threadbaretwo-piece suit, around the shoulders of which he had draped a length of whitecotton cloth in traditional highland fashion. His manner was welcoming andgenial enough but there was also a foxy and calculating look about him thatseemed to forebode imminent financial transactions.I nervously fingered the greasy wad of birr that I had stuffed into my pocketbefore leaving Addis and resolved to pay only for high-quality information.Then, making as little song and dance as possible, I switched on mytape-recorder and asked my first question: did he know the story of how Menelikhad abducted the Ark of the Covenant from the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem?Yes, Yohannes translated, of course he did.And did he know what had happened next?Menelik, the priest replied, had brought the Ark to Ethiopia where it remainedto this day.‘Is he sure’, I asked ‘that this was the original Ark of the Covenant,containing the Ten Commandments inscribed on the Tablets of Stone by the fingerof God?’Yohannes put the question and Abba Gebra Christos replied gravely: ‘Yes. I amsure.’‘OK. Good. Now tell me … was this same original Ark ever brought here to LakeZwai – to Debra Zion?’‘Yes,’ said the priest, ‘at the time of Gudit the Ark was brought here fromAxum.’‘But why was it brought here?’ I asked. ‘I mean, why here? Why such a long way?Surely there must have been hundreds of secret places where it could have beenhidden in Tigray?’‘Listen … This Gudit … she was a devil. She burned many churches in Tigray. Andin other regions of Ethiopia. It was a time of great fighting, great danger. Ourforefathers were very much afraid that she would capture the Ark. So theybrought it out of Axum and they carried it to Zwai where they knew that it wouldbe safe. They travelled only by night, hiding by day in forests and in caves.They were very much afraid, I tell you! But in this way they evaded her soldiersand they brought the Ark to Zwai and to this island.’‘Do you know how long it remained here?’With no hesitation at all Abba Gebra Christos replied: ‘After seventy-two yearsit was returned back to Axum.’Now, I thought, was the right time to pop the sixty-four thousand dollarquestion: ‘Has there been any other occasion’, I asked tentatively, ‘when theArk has been brought here again for safekeeping? Perhaps recently?’Again there was no hesitation: ‘Never.’‘So as far as you know it is still in Axum?’‘Yes.’‘Even now – with all the fighting going on in Tigray?’He shrugged: ‘I believe so. But that is only my opinion. To find out truly youmust ask those in Axum.’Another thought now occurred to me: ‘When we were walking up here,’ I said,‘some of the monks told us that you have an ancient book in which is written thehistory of how the Ark came to Debra Zion in Gudit’s time. Is that correct? Doyou have such a book?’As Yohannes translated this question, the wizened features of Abba GebraChristos formed themselves into the expression of one who has just tastedsomething unexpectedly sour. He responded readily enough, however: ‘Yes, thereis a book.’‘Can we see it?’A momentary hesitation, then: ‘Yes … But the part concerning the Ark is nolonger there.’‘I’m sorry. I don’t follow. What do you mean exactly?’‘About twenty years ago a certain man came and cut some pages from the book andtook those pages away with him. They were the pages in which the story of theArk was told.’‘This man. Was he a foreigner? Or was he an Ethiopian?’‘Well, he was an Ethiopian. But since that time we have not been able to trackhim down.’As I considered the implications of this last answer I could not help butreflect on the bizarre and convoluted nature of the enterprise that I was nowinvolved in. Was the matter of the unknown man who had cut an unknown number ofpages from an unknown book something that should concern me? Or was it anirrelevance? Was I picking up the traces of someone else’s quest for the Ark ofthe Covenant? Or was I dealing simply with a local manuscript hunter who twentyyears ago had made a fast buck on the antiquities market with the sale of a fewilluminated folios?I suspected that I might never know. Pursuing the Ark through Ethiopia wasturning out to be far more daunting and difficult than I had ever imagined.Indeed it was something like pursuing a ghost through a maze. Avenues thatseemed promising and open from one perspective turned out, on closerexamination, to be impassable dead ends; by contrast apparent dead ends had morethan once transformed themselves into paths to understanding.I sighed, refocussed my mind on the immediate issue, and told Abba GebraChristos that even if the most important pages were missing, I would still verymuch like to see the book that he had mentioned. Perhaps he would allow us tophotograph it?This suggestion produced a flurry of nervous objections. No, the old priestsaid, he could not possibly let us do that. Photographs were out of the questionunless specific written permission were given by the Patriarch of the EthiopianOrthodox Church in Addis Ababa. Did we by any chance have such permission?No, we did not.Then, regretfully, we could not photograph the book. We could, however, see itif that was what we wanted.I indicated that we would be grateful even for that small mercy. Abba GebraChristos nodded sagely, led us inside his church and walked over to a cupboardnear the back of the humble building. A tremendous pantomime ensued as hesearched in all his pockets for the necessary key – which, after some moments,he confessed that he could not find.A young deacon was then summoned and sent off somewhere. Ten minutes later,panting and out of breath, the boy returned clutching a bundle of at leasttwenty keys. One after another these were tried in the lock and eventually – tomy considerable surprise – the door was opened. The cupboard, however, wasalmost bare and the one book that it contained proved to be an earlytwentieth-century work donated to the church by Princess Zauditu, the daughterof Emperor Menelik II.At this point Abba Gebra Christos suddenly remembered an important fact: themanuscript we wanted to see was not in the church after all. A few weeks ago hehimself had taken it to the repository, which was in a separate building somedistance away. If we would like to accompany him he would show it to us there.I looked at my watch, decided there was just enough time before we had to leavethe island, and gave my assent to this plan. A lengthy hike followed and weeventually arrived at a rather decrepit stone-built two-storey house. The priestushered us grandly into a dank and musty rear room, around the walls of whichwere arranged dozens of wooden chests and garishly painted tin trunks. After amoment of indecision he advanced towards one of these trunks and threw back itslid revealing a pile of books within. He lifted out the topmost of these – aweighty tome with pages made of cured sheepskin – and passed it over to me.Richard Pankhurst and Yohannes crowded round as I opened the volume. Theyimmediately confirmed that it was written in Ge’ez. Moreover it was undoubtedlyvery old: ‘From the style of the illuminations, and from the binding, I wouldguess thirteenth century,’ volunteered Richard. ‘It’s certainly not later thanthe fourteenth century. There’s no doubt that it’s an early work. Probably veryvaluable.’Eagerly we began to turn the pages. At no point, however, was there anyindication that anything had been removed. As far as we could tell themanuscript was intact. We pointed this out to Abba Gebra Christos, who had beenstanding silently watching us, and asked him whether he was absolutely certainthat this was the book he had talked to us about.As it turned out, it was not. Apologetically the old priest then rummaged in anumber of other boxes around the room, passing us a series of ancientmanuscripts.‘It’s quite amazing,’ Richard commented at one point. ‘So many old books. A realtreasure trove. And they’re just lying here in complete disarray. They could getdamp. They could get stolen. Anything could happen to them. I wish we could movethe whole lot of them to the Institute.’The last volume we looked at was a wood-bound and beautifully illuminated copyof the Ethiopian Book of Saints. It too was intact. When we had finished goingthrough it Richard nudged me in the ribs: ‘I think,’ he said, ‘that we’re notgetting anywhere here.’I nodded: ‘I think you’re right. And it’s really late. We’d better go or we’llend up having to cross the whole lake in the dark.’Before leaving, however, I asked Yohannes to make a final attempt to get somesense out of the priest. Was the book that told the story of the Ark really hereor not?Certainly it was here, Abba Gebra Christos insisted. Of course it was here. Theonly problem was that he was no longer certain in which box he had placed it. Ifwe would care to wait – just a little longer – he was sure that he could locateit …This was an offer that I felt safe in declining. It seemed to me that the oldman was being deliberately evasive – and if that were the case then presumablyit meant that he was hiding something. But what? Not, I thought, the Ark itself.Perhaps not even the notorious book. But something, definitely.Puzzled and a little piqued I led the way back to the motorboat. We said ourfarewells. Then, with at least an hour of sunlight still left in the sky, weheaded out onto the still waters of Lake Zwai.I wrote in my notebook:I don’t believe there is any purpose in spending further time investigatingDebra Zion. After interviewing the monks and the senior priest I feel quitecertain that the importance of the island lies solely in the strength of itsancient traditions concerning the Ark of the Covenant. Broadly speaking thesetraditions seem to confirm what Belai Gedai told me in one of our telephoneconversations – namely that the Ark was brought to Debra Zion in the tenthcentury to keep it safe from Gudit, that it stayed here for about seventy years,and that it was then returned to Axum.The fact that the mother-tongue of all the islanders is Tigrigna rather thanAmharic is strong ‘social’ evidence in support of the oral history I was given –because the only logical explanation for such an ethnographic peculiarity isthat there was indeed a movement of population from the Axum area to Debra Zionin the distant past. Something as momentous as the need to bring the Ark tosafety could certainly account for a migration of this sort. Moreover, if therelic did stay here for as long a period as seventy years before being takenback to Axum, then it’s quite easy to see why some of the descendants of theoriginal migrants would have wanted to stay on the island, which would have beenthe only home they knew. It’s also to be expected that they would havemaintained a folk memory of the glorious events in which their forefathers wereinvolved.That folk memory is what I’ve spent most of the afternoon listening to. In theprocess some intriguing local mysteries surfaced. At no point, however, did Iget any sense at all that the Ark might actually be here now. On the contrary, Ifeel confident in saying that it isn’t here – and, furthermore, that it hasn’tbeen here for the best part of a thousand years.Since the same goes for the islands of Lake Tana as well it’s becomingtransparently obvious that Axum is still the most probable place for the relicto be. In other words, like it or not, I’m going to have to go to Axum. The besttime to do that would be in January during Timkat, which is the one occasionwhen I might be able to get close to the Ark without having to gain access tothe sanctuary chapel. And Timkat 1770 was when Bruce was there – presumably forthe same reason.I closed my notebook and looked up at Richard and Yohannes. ‘Do you thinkthere’s any possibility,’ I asked, ‘that the government will have captured Axumby January? I’d really like to get there in time to attend the next Timkat.’Yohannes said nothing. Richard made a face: ‘A nice idea. But you might as wellplan to fly to the moon.’‘Well,’ I said, ‘it was just a thought.’It was after dark when we finally moored the motorboat at the Ministry ofFisheries jetty, and almost 10 p.m. by the time we reached the sprawlingoutskirts of Addis Ababa. We instructed our driver to head for Yohannes’s officein the centre of town where we had parked our cars that morning (there werestill two hours left before curfew and our plan was to grab a quick dinner at anearby restaurant). As we climbed down out of the Landcruiser, however, we hearda prolonged burst of automatic rifle fire which seemed to come from an apartmentblock just across the road. Seconds later there were two short answering burstsfrom a different weapon. Then a profound silence fell.‘What on earth was that all about?’ I asked.‘Probably nothing serious,’ Richard offered. ‘There have been a few isolatedincidents since the attempted coup … shootings here and there. But nothingmajor.’‘Nevertheless,’ said Yohannes gravely, ‘I think that it would be wise for us toabandon dinner. Let us all go to our homes.’AN ETHNOGRAPHIC FINGERPRINTBack at the Hilton I slept soundly and awoke before seven the next morning –Friday 24 November. I then took a turn in the pool, had breakfast and telephonedthe office of Shimelis Mazengia. The Politburo member had asked Richard and meto report back to him after completing our trips to Lake Tana and Lake Zwai. Hissecretary now told me that she had been expecting my call and gave us anappointment for three o’clock that same afternoon.Satisfied with this arrangement, and determined to bring up the question ofTimkat and Axum despite Richard’s pessimism, I left the hotel and drove round tothe Institute of Ethiopian Studies.My research on Wednesday the 22nd had established the plausibility of theNile/Takazze route mentioned in the Kebra Nagast and also by the priest on TanaKirkos.17 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts17] What I wanted to do nowwas to test out a hypothesis that had subsequently taken rough shape in my mind.It seemed to me that if Menelik and the first-born sons of the elders of Israelhad indeed brought the Ark to Tana Kirkos by following the Takazze river, thenthis would have had implications for the distribution of the Jewish faith inEthiopia. If there was some truth to the legend, I reasoned, then thetraditional epicentre of the Falasha population should lie between the Takazzeand Lake Tana – since it would have been in precisely this area that Menelikwould first have begun to convert the local population to Judaism. If thelegends were false, however, then I might expect to find that the bulk of theFalashas lived elsewhere – most likely much further north and close to the RedSea (since academic orthodoxy had it that their forefathers had been convertedby Jewish immigrants from the Yemen).I turned first to James Bruce, whose early work on the Falashas had alreadyimpressed me so much. In Volume III of his Travels I knew that the Scottishauthor had devoted a chapter to what might loosely be termed the ‘socialgeography’ of eighteenth-century Ethiopia. Though I did not remember thecontents of this chapter very clearly I hoped that it would have something tosay about the location of the principal Falasha settlements at that time.I was not disappointed. Bruce’s survey began in the north of Ethiopia – at theRed Sea port of Massawa – and worked inland from there. Several ethnic groupswere covered but no mention was made of the Falashas in either Eritrea orTigray. ‘After passing the Takazze’, however, the country stretching to thesouth and west as far as Lake Tana was described as being:in great part possessed by Jews, and there [the] king and queen of that nationand, as they say, of the house of Judah, maintain still their ancientsovereignty and religion from very early times.18[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts18]Writing in the nineteenth century (about eighty years after Bruce) the Germanmissionary Martin Flad had recorded a similar distribution of population, notingthat the Falashas lived in a total of fourteen provinces – all of which lay‘west of the Takazze’.19 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts19]The modern sources that I next reviewed painted the same picture. The vastmajority of Ethiopia’s Jews inhabited the territory to the west and south of theTakazze river: this was their traditional homeland and their occupation of itwas ancient beyond memory.20 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts20] Oneparticularly detailed and authoritative study included a map in which the entirearea of Falasha settlement was shaded – a long but relatively narrow stripextending south-west from the Takazze through the Simien mountains and the cityof Gondar and then going on, without any interruption, to encompass the whole ofLake Tana.21 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts21]It would have been difficult to find more telling support for my hypothesis thatthis – with the unique impetus provided by the presence of the Ark on TanaKirkos – had been precisely the area in which the conversion of nativeAbyssinians to Old Testament Judaism had been concentrated. On the basis of myown research (see Chapter 6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm]) I had anywaybegun to doubt the merits of the academic theory which held that the Jewishfaith had first been imported into the far north of Ethiopia from the Yemen atsome point after AD 70. Hitherto my dissatisfaction with such notions hadstemmed mainly from their failure to explain the extremely archaic nature ofFalasha beliefs and rituals (again, see Chapter 6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm]). Now the ethnographic evidence made thecase against the ‘Yemeni connection’ look even stronger: on the map, the area inwhich the Falashas lived stood out like a tell-tale fingerprint confirming thatthe religion of Solomon could only have entered Ethiopia from the west – throughEgypt and the Sudan along the ancient and well-travelled trade routes providedby the Nile and Takazze rivers.22 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts22]THE VIRTUE OF PATIENCEAt three sharp, Richard and I kept our appointment with Shimelis Mazengia. ThePolitburo member first of all wanted to hear how our trips to Lake Tana and toLake Zwai had gone. Had we been successful? Had we found anything out?I replied that our discoveries on Tana Kirkos island – and the strange, archaictraditions that had been reported to us there – had had a profound effect on mythinking. I was now almost certain that this was the region to which the Ark ofthe Covenant had first been brought before being taken to Axum.‘So you really believe that we have the Ark?’ Shimelis asked with a smile.‘I’m increasingly confident of that. The evidence is building up …’ I hesitated,then turned his question back on him: ‘What do you think?’‘I think there is something very special in the sanctuary at Axum. Notnecessarily the Ark, mind you, but something very special. It is an ancienttradition. It cannot completely be ignored.’I asked whether his government had ever made a determined effort to find outwhether the sacred – and immensely valuable – relic was really there or not. TheWorkers’ Party of Ethiopia were Marxists, after all, and so presumably were nothampered by reactionary superstitions. It was only quite recently that they’dlost Axum to the TPLF. Prior to that, hadn’t they ever thought of taking a look?‘We never for a moment considered it,’ Shimelis replied. ‘Never for a singlemoment … If we had tried to do something like that I think we would have had’ –he smiled ironically – ‘a revolution on our hands. Our people are verytraditional, as you know, and there would have been an explosion if anygovernment official had ever involved himself in such a matter.’‘Do you think the TPLF have the same attitude?’ I asked. ‘Now that they controlAxum, I mean.’The Politburo member shrugged: ‘That is not for me to say. But they are notrenowned for their religious sensitivities …’I was a little hesitant about putting my next question, but did so anyway: ‘I’msorry if this sounds impertinent,’ I said, ‘but I’ve got to ask. Is there anychance at all that your side is going to win the city back in the immediatefuture?’‘Why do you ask?’‘Because I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m going to have to go there myself.In fact I’d like to get there for the next Timkat celebrations.’‘You mean this coming January?’I nodded my head.‘Impossible,’ said Shimelis flatly. ‘Besides, why be in such a hurry? If you areright, then the Ark has already been in our country for three millennia. Inanother year, two at the most, we will recapture Axum and when we do I think Ican promise that you will be the first foreigner into the city. So be patient.You will get your chance.’I had to admit that this was sound advice. In a country like Ethiopia patiencewas almost always a virtue. I was not prepared to wait two years, however. Itherefore silently resolved to aim for Axum not in January 1990, but in January1991. The confidence that Shimelis had shown had impressed me and I hoped verymuch that the sacred city would be back in government hands by then. Meanwhile,however – just as a precaution – I thought that I might also try to open up somedialogue with the TPLF. I had hitherto avoided the rebels but it now seemed tome that it might be in my interests to make some preliminary overtures in theirdirection.I looked across the table at Shimelis. ‘You’re right of course,’ I said. ‘Butwould you mind if I asked you another favour?’With an eloquent hand gesture, the Politburo member indicated that I should goahead.‘I’d still like to attend a Timkat ceremony,’ I continued, ‘and since Axum isobviously out of the question I was wondering whether I might be able to go toGondar this January instead.’Beside me Richard coughed politely. The city that I had just named wasreportedly besieged by rebel forces and there had been rumours that it mightfall any day.‘Why Gondar?’ Shimelis asked.‘Because it’s in the Lake Tana area – which, as I said, I’ve identified as beingclosely associated with the early history of the Ark in this country. Andbecause I understand that many Falashas still live in and around Gondar. Iremember passing through Jewish villages just north of the city way back in1983, but I didn’t have a chance to carry out any proper interviews at thattime. So what I’d like to do, if it’s OK with you, is kill two birds with onestone. I’d like to attend Timkat in Gondar. And while I’m there I’d like tocarry out some research amongst the Falashas.’‘It may be possible,’ replied Shimelis. ‘It depends on the military situation,but it may be possible. I shall look into it and let you know.’"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11AND DAVID DANCED BEFORE THE ARK …On 18 and 19 January 1770 the Scottish adventurer James Bruce had quietlyattended the Timkat ceremonials in Axum and, as outlined in Chapter 7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c07_r1.htm], I believed that he had done so in order toget as close as possible to the Ark of the Covenant.Exactly two hundred and twenty years later – on 18 and 19 January 1990 – Iattended Timkat in the city of Gondar to the north of Lake Tana. Moreover,although I had not shared my true feelings with either Richard Pankhurst or withShimelis Mazengia, I saw this trip as being of pivotal significance to my quest.Immersed as I was in the great historical mystery that connected the Ark toEthiopia, it had become clear to me that sooner or later, somehow or other, Iwas going to have to go back to Axum. I had resolved to try to make thathazardous visit in January 1991 – and to make it under the auspices of therebels if necessary. I therefore saw Gondar as a crucial ‘dry run’: the closestpoint to Axum still in government hands, it was also, like Axum, a formercapital of Ethiopia, an important historic site and a centre of religiouslearning. In such a setting, I reasoned, I might hope to prepare myselfspiritually and psychologically for the real ordeal that lay ahead, tofamiliarize myself with aspects of the same arcane rituals that Bruce must havewitnessed in 1770, to gather such intelligence as I could, and to quicken mycommitment to the quest.This, however, was not the only voice within me. Other, less steadfast thoughtsalso passed through my mind and I could see the possibility of a differentoutcome. If, for example, I were to discover anything at Gondar which castserious doubt on the legitimacy of Ethiopia’s claim to be the last resting placeof the Ark then might I not – with honour – abandon my plan to go to Axum in1991?This was a disturbing but oddly seductive notion to which I found myselfincreasingly attracted as the date of the Gondar trip approached. That tripitself was for a while in doubt – indeed it was not until 8 January 1990 that Ifinally received a telex from Shimelis confirming that the necessary permissionhad been obtained from the military authorities.RIDDLES TO SOLVEI knew that I could expect a central feature of the Timkat ceremonies to be thecarrying in procession of the tabotat – the symbols or replicas of the Ark ofthe Covenant normally kept in the Holy of Holies of every Ethiopian church. Ofcourse in Gondar I would not see the object which the Ethiopians claimed to bethe Ark itself (since there was no suggestion that it had ever been lodgedthere). What I would see, however, was an event otherwise identical in characterthat was regarded as the supreme festival of the Ethiopian Orthodox calendar.I had been aware for some time that Timkat meant ‘Epiphany’ – a holy dayassociated by the western church with the manifestation of Christ to theGentiles.1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts1] Epiphany, however, hadan entirely different significance amongst eastern Christians, for whom itcommemorated the Baptism of Christ.2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts2] I had established that theEthiopians were in complete agreement with the rest of the eastern church onthis latter point, but that they diverged radically from the norm when it cameto the specific rituals employed.3 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts3]In particular, their use of the tabot was unique to them, unparalleled in anyother culture and unrecognized even by the Coptic Patriarchate in Alexandria4[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts4] (which had supplied Ethiopia withall its archbishops from the date of the conversion of the Axumite kingdom in AD331 until autocephaly was achieved in 19595[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts5]).Against this background I felt that close observation of the Timkat rituals andof the role of the tabotat within them might help me to fathom what I had longsince come to regard as the central paradox of Ethiopian Christianity – namelyits infiltration, indeed domination, by a pre-Christian relic: the Ark of theCovenant.This, however, was not my sole purpose in making the trip to Gondar. While thereI also intended to talk to Falashas living in the environs of the city.I had already mentioned this to Shimelis and he had not objected – for thesimple reason that much had changed since my previous visit to the area in 1983.Then, driving north from Gondar into the Simien mountains, official policy hadmade it almost impossible to do any serious work amongst the black Jews: theirvillages had been effectively out of bounds and there had been no opportunity toobserve their customs or to carry out proper interviews.This repressive state of affairs had been swept away in November 1989 when,after a sixteen-year break, Addis Ababa and Jerusalem had restored diplomaticrelations. At the heart of this agreement was a commitment on Ethiopia’s part toallow the Falashas – all the Falashas – to emigrate to Israel. By then, anyway,there were few enough left – probably no more than 15,000.6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts6] All the others had died during thefamines of the mid-1980s or had already fled clandestinely to Israel via refugeecamps in the Sudan (from which, during 1984/5 alone, the airlift known as‘Operation Moses’ had taken more than 12,000 to safety7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts7]).The net effect of all this, by January 1990, was that the number of EthiopianJews was dwindling fast. In the three months since the restoration of diplomaticrelations some 3,000 of them had left the country. Many more had deserted theirvillages and flocked to Addis Ababa hoping for an early place on the planes out.Inexorable and unstoppable, this latter-day Exodus was gathering pace, and Icould see that very soon not a single Falasha would be left in Ethiopia.Thereafter, of course, it would still be possible to interview them and researchtheir folklore and traditions in the Promised Land. This, however, would almostcertainly be the last year in which it would be possible to get any impressionat all of their traditional life in its traditional surroundings.I was determined not to miss this chance: the riddle of how there had ever cometo be Jews – indigenous, black Jews – in the heart of Ethiopia was intimatelyconnected to the enigma of the Holy Ark; solve one, I felt, and I would solvethe other.Neither were the Falashas the only ethnic group of interest to me in the Gondararea. In the week of research that I had done just prior to my departure fromEngland I had turned up an intriguing reference to another people – a peopleknown as the Qemant who were described as ‘Hebraeo-Pagans’ in the singleanthropological paper written about them.8[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts8] Published in 1969 by an Americanscholar named Frederick Gamst, this obscure monograph observed that:The Hebraism found among the Qemant is an ancient form unaffected by Hebraicreligious change of the past two millennia. This Hebraism is dominant in thereligion of the Falasha, neighbours of the Qemant … sometimes called ‘the blackJews of Ethiopia’.9 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts9]I had hitherto been completely unaware of the Qemant and was therefore intriguedby Gamst’s suggestion that their religion contained ancient ‘Hebraic’ elements.This, I felt, was a matter that obviously merited further investigation since itmight help to shed light on the antiquity of Judaic influence in Ethiopia – andalso on the pervasiveness of that influence.THE ONE GOD AND THE FETISH TREEIn his study of the Qemant Gamst had mentioned that he had been befriended by areligious leader who had helped him enormously with his field work in the 1960s.The name of this dignitary, I knew, was Muluna Marsha and his title was Wambar(a word meaning ‘High Priest’ in the Qemant language). In the short timeavailable, it seemed to me that my best strategy would be to try to locate thisman (whom Gamst had described as a mine of information) and to interview himabout the religious beliefs of his people. I could not be sure, however, whetherhe would still be alive after so many years – or even whether I would be able tofind any Qemant still adhering to the traditional Hebraeo-Pagan faith (sincethere had been less than five hundred of them in Gamst’s time10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts10]).After my arrival in Gondar on Wednesday 17 January I discussed this worry withthe officials who came to meet me at the airport and was told that there were avery few Qemant – now mostly elderly – who continued to adhere to the oldreligion. Feelers were then put out, radio messages were sent to Party cadres inremote areas, and, on Thursday the 18th, I got the good news that the Wambar wasstill alive. His home village, apparently, was inaccessible by road but it wasthought possible that he might be persuaded to come to an intermediate point –Aykel, about two hours’ drive due west of Gondar. The journey, furthermore,would almost certainly be safe: in recent fighting the rebels had been pushedback and the western region into which we would be going was considered to besecure during daylight hours.Timkat, which I shall describe later in this chapter, took up all of myattention for the rest of Thursday and all of Friday. Early in the afternoon ofSaturday 20 January, however, I was finally able to set off for Aykel in theToyota Landcruiser that the Party had put at my disposal. In addition to thedriver, I was accompanied by Legesse Desta – the young and enthusiastic officialwho was acting as my interpreter – and by two dour soldiers armed withKalashnikov assault rifles.As we bumped along the rough, graded track through glowing fields andgolden-brown hills I studied the Michelin map of the Horn of Africa that I nowtook everywhere with me. I was interested to note that our destination lay notfar from the headwaters of the Atbara river which rose about fifty miles to thenorth-west of Lake Tana and flowed from there into the Sudan, where it waseventually joined by the Takazze before merging with the Nile just above theFifth Cataract.Because it passed so close to Tana Kirkos, and because it was specificallymentioned in the Kebra Nagast, the Takazze itself still looked to me like thestrongest contender for the route of the Ark. Nevertheless it was clear from themap that travellers following the Atbara would also have arrived in this samegeneral area. I considered the implications of this and then remarked in myjournal:The rivers are roads through the desert. In the case of Ethiopia all these‘roads’ – whether the Takazze, the Atbara, or the Blue Nile – seem to lead toLake Tana. The Falashas (and their relatives the ‘Hebraeo-Pagan’ Qemant) havealways lived in precisely this area and are indigenous Ethiopians – natives ofthis country. Since their Judaism (or ‘Hebraism’ as Gamst prefers to call it) isa foreign element in their culture, it is logical to deduce that it must havebeen imported along the rivers.As we drove into Aykel we were met by a group of local Party officials who toldus that Wambar Muluna Marsha had arrived some time ago and was waiting for us.We were then taken to a large, circular hut with a high beehive-shaped roof andushered into the cool semi-darkness within. Thin shafts of sunlight fell throughgaps in the wattle-and-daub, highlighting motes of dust that hung suspended inthe air. From the newly brushed earth floor there arose a loamy fragrancecomplicated by a faint note of sandalwood.The Wambar, as I had expected, was an elderly man. He had evidently dressed upfor this occasion since he was wearing a white turban, white ceremonial robesand a fine black cape. Seated on one of the several chairs that had beenarranged inside the hut, he stood graciously as we came in and, after thenecessary introductions had been made, shook my hand warmly.Speaking through the interpreter he immediately asked: ‘Do you work with MrGamst?’I had to admit that I did not. ‘But,’ I added, ‘I’ve read the book that he wroteabout your people. That’s why I’m here. I’m very interested in learning aboutyour religion.’The Wambar smiled rather mournfully. As he did so I noticed that one tooth,disconcertingly long, grew down from the left side of his upper jaw andprotruded tusk-like over his lower lip. ‘Our religion’, he said, ‘has become athing of the past. Almost nobody practises it today. The Qemant are nowChristians.’‘But you yourself are not a Christian …?’‘No. I am the Wambar. I still follow the old ways.’‘And are there others like you?’‘A few remain.’ That smile again. Then, slyly and somewhat paradoxically: ‘Eventhose who say they are Christians have not entirely abandoned their formerbeliefs. The sacred groves are still tended … The sacrifices are still made.’ Apause for thought, a shake of the old, grizzled head, a sigh: ‘But things arechanging … Always there is change …’‘You said “sacred groves”. What did you mean by that?’‘Our worship, if it is conducted as it should be, takes place in the open air.And we prefer to make our devotions amongst trees. For this purpose we have setaside special groves called degegna.’I put several more questions on this subject and established that there were infact two kinds of groves. Some – the degegna themselves – were used for annualceremonies. They had first been planted in the distant past when the founder ofthe Qemant religion was shown the correct locations in his dreams. In additionthere were other much smaller sacred sites – called qole – which often consistedof only a single tree where a particularly powerful spirit was believed toreside. These qole were normally situated in high places. As it happened therewas one on the outskirts of Aykel which I could see if I liked.I then asked the Wambar if he knew whether the Falashas also venerated sacredgroves.‘No,’ he replied, ‘they do not.’‘Would you say that their religion is in any way similar to yours?’A sage nod: ‘Yes. In many ways. We have much in common.’ Unprompted he thenadded: ‘The founder of the Qemant religion was called Anayer. He came here toEthiopia so long ago. He came, after seven years of famine, from his owncountry, which was far away. As he travelled on the journey with his wife andchildren he met the founder of the Falasha religion, also travelling on the samejourney with his wife and children. A marriage alliance was discussed betweenthe two groups, but it did not succeed.’‘Did Anayer and the founder of the Falasha religion come originally from thesame country?’‘Yes. But they were separate. They made no marriage alliance.’‘Nevertheless, the country of their birth was the same?’‘Yes.’‘Do you know where it was?’‘It was far … It was in the Middle East.’‘Do you know the name of this country?’‘It was the land of Canaan. Anayer was the grandson of Canaan who was the son ofHam, who was the son of Noah.’I was intrigued by this genealogy and by the faded memory of an ancestralmigration from the Middle East – a memory that also suggested a common locus forthe origin of the Falasha and the Qemant religions. I could not get the Wambarto confirm whether the ‘Canaan’ that he had referred to was the Promised Land ofthe Bible. Indeed, despite his familiarity with names like Ham and Noah, heclaimed never to have read the Bible. I believed him on this point but, at thesame time, was in no doubt that there was a scriptural background to what he hadjust told me. Contained in his account, for example, were echoes of the greattrek made by the patriarch Abraham and his wife Sarah who had fled Canaan and‘journeyed, going on still toward the south’ because ‘there was famine in theland’.11 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts11] At the same time, likeEgypt in the book of Genesis, the country that Anayer had come from had beenafflicted by seven years of famine.12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts12]‘Tell me more about your religion,’ I now asked the Wambar. ‘You mentionedspirits earlier – spirits living in trees. But what about God? Do you believe inone God, or many gods?’‘We believe in one God. Only one God. But he is supported by angels.’The Wambar then went on to list these angels: Jakaranti, Kiberwa, Aderaiki,Kiddisti, Mezgani, Shemani, Anzatatera. Each, apparently, had his owndistinctive place in the countryside. ‘When our religion was strong, all theQement used to go to these places to pray to the angels to mediate with God ontheir behalf. Jakaranti was the most respected, then Mezgani and Anzatatera.’‘And God?’ I asked. ‘The God of the Qemant. Does he have a name?’‘Of course. His name is Yeadara.’‘Where does he reside?’‘He is everywhere.’A single God then, and an omnipresent one. I was beginning, already, to see whyGamst had characterized these people as Hebraeo-Pagans. This impression,furthermore, was strengthened by almost everything else that the Wambar told meduring our long discussion in the village of Aykel. I kept detailed notes ofthat discussion and, after my return to Addis Ababa, made a careful study of hisanswers – comparing them point by point with the Scriptures. Only when I hadcompleted this exercise was I able to appreciate just how strong and how old theJudaic dimension of Qemant religion really was.The Wambar had told me, for example, that the Qemant were forbidden to eat anyanimal that was not cloven-hoofed and that did not chew the cud. In addition, hehad said, camels and pigs were regarded as unclean and were strictly forbidden.These restrictions accorded perfectly with those placed upon the Jews in theeleventh chapter of the Old Testament book of Leviticus.13[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts13]The Wambar had also said that amongst the Qemant even ‘clean’ animals could notbe eaten if they had not been slaughtered properly. ‘Their throats must be cutuntil all the blood is gone,’ he had explained – adding that, for the samereason, it was forbidden to eat any animal that had died of natural causes. Bothproscriptions, I discovered, were perfectly in line with Judaic law.14[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts14]Still on the subject of food, the Wambar had told me that the consumption ofmeat and dairy products at the same table was permitted by Qemant religion. Hehad added, however, that it was regarded as an abomination to eat the flesh ofan animal that had been cooked in milk. I knew that orthodox Jews were forbiddento mix meat and dairy foods in the same meal. When I researched the backgroundto this particular Kosher restriction, however, I learnt that it derived itsauthority from the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy, both of which stated: ‘Thoushalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.’15[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts15] This, more or less exactly, wasthe rule obeyed by the Qemant.Another area of convergence concerned the Sabbath – which, like the Jews, theQemant observed on Saturday. ‘It is forbidden to work on that day,’ the Wambarhad told me. ‘It is forbidden to light fires on Saturday. And if a field shouldcatch fire accidentally on the Sabbath then that is a field that we must nolonger use.’16 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts16]These restrictions and others like them – all very much in accord with biblicallaw – made me more and more confident that a deep and truly ancient Judaicsubstratum did indeed underlie the religion of the Qemant. What finallyconvinced me that this was so, however, was the one practice that the Wambar haddescribed to me which had not sounded Judaic at all – namely the veneration of‘sacred groves’.He had told me during our interview that there was a qole site on the outskirtsof Aykel where I might see a tree believed to be the residence of a powerfulspirit. I did go to look at this tree, which turned out to be a huge, spreadingacacia. It stood to the west of the village on a spur of high ground, beyondwhich, across a hundred descending miles, the land sloped steeply away towardsthe Sudanese border. A soft afternoon breeze, laden with the fragrance ofdistant deserts, blew through the tawny canyons beneath me, circulated amongstthe ravines and foothills, and soared on eagles’ wings across the firstbattlements of the escarpment.Gnarled and massive, the acacia was so ancient that it would have been easy tobelieve that it had stood here for hundreds and perhaps even for thousands ofyears. Inside the walled enclosure that surrounded it, laid out upon the ground,were various offerings – a jar of oil, a heap of millet, small piles of roastedcoffee beans, and a trussed chicken awaiting sacrifice. In their own way allthese oblations contributed to the peculiar character of the place: numinous andeerie, by no means menacing but none the less distinctly strange.What multiplied this other-worldly effect, however – and what made this Qemantqole site so different from any other place of worship I had ever come across inmy travels – was the fact that every branch of the tree to a height of about sixfeet off the ground had been festooned with woven strips of vari-coloured cloth.Rustling in the wind, these waving pennants and ribbons seemed to whisper andmurmur – almost as though they were seeking to impart a message. And I rememberthinking that if I could only understand that message then many hidden thingsmight be revealed. Superstitiously I touched the living wood, sensed its age,and returned to my companions who were awaiting me at the bottom of the hill.Later, back in Addis – after I had looked into the other comparisons betweenQemant religion and Old Testament Judaism – I ran a routine check in theScriptures and in works of biblical archaeology to see if I could find anyreferences to sacred trees. I did not expect that I would. Much to my surprise,however, I discovered that certain specially planted forest groves had beenaccorded a sacred character in the very earliest phases of the evolution of theJewish faith. I was also able to confirm that these groves had been used asplaces of active worship. In the twenty-first chapter of the book of Genesis,for example, it was stated that: ‘Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, andcalled there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.’17[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts17]Reading more widely around the subject I established the following points withcertainty: first, that the Hebrews had ‘borrowed’ the use of sacred groves fromthe Canaanites (who were the indigenous inhabitants of the Promised Land);second, that the groves were normally situated in high places (known as bamoth);and third, that they often contained sacrificial stone pillars of the kind thatI had seen on Tana Kirkos and that – as I already knew – were calledmasseboth.18 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts18]Very little was understood about how the groves had been used, what they hadlooked like, what sort of ceremonies had gone on within them, or what kind ofofferings had been made there. The reason for this ignorance was that thepriestly elite of later biblical times had turned savagely against all suchpractices, cutting down and burning the sacred trees and overthrowing themasseboth.19 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts19]Since it was these same priests who had also been responsible for thecompilation and editing of the Scriptures, it was hardly surprising that theyhad left us with no clear picture of the function and appearance of the groves.Moreover the single reference that did evoke some kind of image was regarded asa mystery by biblical scholars. This reference, in the second book of Kings,spoke of a place ‘where the women wove hangings for the grove.’20[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts20] As I read these words, the memorywas still fresh in my mind of the strips of woven cloth that hung from everybranch of the fetish tree on the outskirts of the village of Aykel. And itseemed to me then (as it seems to me now) that there was no mystery at all aboutthe words in the book of Kings – but much that still cried out for explanationabout the Qemant who, in the heart of Africa, had managed to acquire aJudaeo-Canaanite tradition as hoary with age as this one.The whole issue, I felt sure, was intimately connected to the larger problem ofthe Falashas, the Qemant’s better-known neighbours.ASWAN AND MEROEDespite the strong Judaic flavour of their religion, no one has ever claimedthat the Qemant are in fact Jews: there is too much that is pagan and animistabout them to have allowed that to happen. The position, however, is quitedifferent for the Falashas. They have been widely regarded as true Jews sincethe early nineteenth century – though they were not formally recognized as suchby the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem until 1973. Two years later theAshkenazi Chief Rabbi followed suit, opening the way for the Israeli Ministry ofthe Interior to declare that the Falashas were entitled to automatic citizenshipof Israel under the terms of the Law of Return.21[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts21]Ironically the main reason that rabbinical recognition was so long delayed wasthe pronouncedly Old Testament character of Falasha religion which did not inany way incorporate or refer to the Talmud (the authoritative body of Jewish lawand lore accumulated between 200 BC and AD 50022[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts22]). This made the Falashas seemquite alien to many Israeli and other Jews; it was later accepted, however, thatignorance of Talmudic precepts was simply a function of the fact that theEthiopian arm of the faith must have been cut off from the evolving body ofworld Judaism at some extremely early date. This same isolation also explainedthe Falashas’ continuing adherence to practices that had long been forbidden bythe rabbis, notably animal sacrifice (see Chapter 6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm]).The important point – which weighed heavily when official recognition wasfinally granted in the 1970s – was that the social and religious behaviour ofthe Falashas did clearly and unambiguously conform to the teachings of the Torah(Old Testament). Moreover, within the Torah, as one would expect of pre-TalmudicJews whose religious beliefs were genuinely ancient, they showed the greatestrespect for the Pentateuch (i.e. the five books believed by the orthodox to havebeen written by Moses himself, namely Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers andDeuteronomy).23 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts23]This ‘fundamentalism’ within Falasha religion was typified by their strictobservance of the food restrictions enumerated in the books of Leviticus andDeuteronomy and by their refusal to eat any animal – ‘clean’ or not – that hadbeen slaughtered by a Gentile. It was also recognized that they paid meticulousattention to the Mosaic laws of cleanliness and purity. Special huts, forexample, were set aside for those members of the community considered to betemporarily in states of ritual impurity – such as menstruating women, who weresegregated for seven days in line with a Levitical edict.24[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts24]Falasha circumcision ceremonies (gezrat) were equally traditional, taking placeon the eighth day after the birth of a male child, exactly as stipulated in thePentateuch.25 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts25] Likewise theirSabbath procedures were rigorously orthodox with all fires being extinguishedbefore sunset on Friday, and on the Sabbath itself no work of any kind beingdone, no water being drawn, no fire being lit, no coffee being boiled, and onlythe consumption of cold food and drink being permissible.I was aware of all this when, during my stay in Gondar in January 1990, Ivisited several Falasha settlements. My objective was to make contact withreligious leaders, to whom I wanted to put certain specific questions. Becauseof the mass migration of Ethiopia’s Jews to Israel this was no easy task: manyhomesteads were completely deserted, stripped of their goods and chattels, theirdoors left unbarred, and their inhabitants gone. Nevertheless, in thecountryside some twenty miles from Gondar I did find one village that stillseemed to be functioning. Called Anbober, it straggled across a steep slope inrolling mountainous terrain and was populated almost entirely by women andchildren, the majority of the menfolk having already left for Israel.Falashas have neither synagogues nor rabbis; instead their places of worship arecalled mesgid and their religious officials kahenat (singular kahen, meaning‘priest’). With my interpreter Legesse Desta, I now walked up through thevillage followed by a rapidly growing crowd of mischievous children. We weremaking for the mesgid – identifiable by the Star of David on its roof – where Ihoped very much that I might find the kahen in residence.On this occasion I was not disappointed: inside the humble building, at aroughly made wooden table, a lean, elderly man sat studying a copy of the Torah(which was beautifully written in Ge’ez on cured sheepskin leaves). Legessebegan by explaining why we had come and then asked the priest if he would mindanswering some questions from me. After a lengthy debate he gave his assent tothis and introduced himself as Solomon Alemu. He was, he said, seventy-eightyears old. He had been the kahen of Anbober for almost thirty years.We spent the next couple of hours going through numerous aspects of Falashabelief and ritual. All Solomon’s answers confirmed the pure Old Testamentcharacter of the religion and were very much in line with what I had alreadylearned from my research. In this context I pressed him particularly hard on theissue of blood sacrifice, trying to establish why his people continued with thispractice when Jews everywhere else had abandoned it two thousand yearspreviously. ‘We believe’, he replied with great conviction, ‘that God in histhrone observes these ceremonies and is pleased.’Perhaps Solomon knew, perhaps he did not, how close this simple statement was toa verse in the book of Leviticus which described offerings made by fire as being‘of a sweet savour to the Lord’.26[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts26] Certainly, he seemed a wise andwell read man. When I complimented him on his scholarship, however, his response– with no trace of false modesty – was to insist that he understood far lessabout the Judaic traditions of the Falashas than his father had done. And headded that his father, in his turn, had understood less than his grandfather –who had also been kahen of Anbober. ‘We are forgetting our own past,’ he saidsadly. ‘Day by day we forget our history.’Taking my cue from this I asked Solomon if he knew for how many centuries therehad been Jewish people in Ethiopia.‘We came here’, he replied, ‘long ago … long before the Christians. TheChristians are recent compared with us.’He then proceeded to tell me the familiar story of the Queen of Sheba, Menelikand the bringing of the Ark. In this way, he said, the Jewish faith had arrivedin Ethiopia.I asked casually: ‘Do you have any idea what route Menelik and his companionsused when they made their journey?’Though it might have surprised me once I now accepted his answer to this lastquestion with perfect complacency: ‘According to our traditions they travelledfrom Jerusalem through Egypt and Sudan.’Almost bored, I prompted: ‘Presumably they would have followed the river Nilefor much of the journey?’The kahen nodded: ‘Yes. That is what our traditions say.’ He then added twodetails that were completely new to me: ‘On the way,’ he said, ‘they rested atAswan and Meroe.’Aswan, I knew, was in Upper Egypt (near the site of the modern high dam of thesame name), and in Pharaonic times had been important as a source of the graniteused in the construction of the Pyramids. Meroe, the ancient capital of Nubia,had been located much further to the south, in what is now the Republic of theSudan.Intrigued, I pushed Solomon for more details of the Falasha traditionsconcerning these places. He insisted, however, that the little that he hadalready said was the sum of his knowledge about them. ‘I heard their names’, hesighed, ‘in stories told to me by my grandfather. He was a wise man … but he isgone … Soon we will all be gone.’CEREMONY OF THE ARKEverything that I learned during my stay in Gondar reinforced my view that ithad been to precisely this region of Ethiopia that the Jewish faith had firstbeen brought in antiquity. The Falashas were Jewish through and through, andthis was their homeland. Their near neighbours the Qemant also showed convincingsigns of an archaic and deeply ingrained Judaic influence.Nor was this influence limited to the Falashas and the Qemant. On the contrary,in Gondar and throughout Ethiopia, supposedly ‘Orthodox’ Christians displayedmany customs and beliefs that were unmistakably Jewish in origin. Just like theFalashas, as I already knew, they circumcised their sons on the eighth day afterbirth, a date commanded by the book of Leviticus – a date that, amongst all thepeoples of the world, was now observed only by Jews and by Ethiopians.27[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts27] Likewise (in a remarkableinstance of the phenomenon known as religious syncretism) the Jewish Sabbath wasstill being respected in the twentieth century by millions of AbyssinianChristians – not instead of the Sunday Sabbath adhered to by theirco-religionists elsewhere but in addition to it.28[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts28]There were other holidays which, although superficially Christian, were alsoclearly Judaic in origin. I had learned, for example, that the Ethiopian NewYear feast (Enkutatsh) corresponded closely to the Jewish New Year (RoshHa-shanah). Both were held in September and both were followed a few weeks laterby a second festival (known as Maskal in Ethiopia and Yom Kippur in Israel). Inboth cultures, furthermore, this second festival was connected to the New Yearby a period of expiation and atonement.29[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts29]Ethiopian Christians also strictly obeyed many of the Pentateuchal laws ofcleanliness and purity. No man, for example, would consider going to churchafter having had sexual intercourse with his wife, nor would he have intercourseprior to having contact with any consecrated thing, nor would he haveintercourse during days of fasting, nor would he have intercourse with anymenstruating woman.30 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts30] None ofthese restrictions were called for by Christian lore; all of them, however, weredemanded in the Pentateuch (notably in the books of Exodus and Leviticus31[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts31]).In a similar fashion Ethiopian Christians also observed the Old Testament foodlaws, scrupulously avoiding the flesh of ‘unclean’ birds and mammals (pork beingparticularly abhorred) and even attending to the minutiae such as the ‘sinewwhich shrank’ referred to in Chapter 32 of the book of Genesis.32[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts32] This same sinew, I was able toestablish, was shunned by all Abyssinian Christians and was known in Ge’ez as‘the forbidden muscle’.33 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts33]Another intriguing link that I had turned up while researching this subject wasthat Ethiopian clerical vestments seemed to be modelled upon the specialgarments worn by the priests of ancient Israel34[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts34] – the k’enat (belt) correspondingto the High Priest’s girdle;35 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts35]the k’oba (skull-cap) corresponding to the mitre;36[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts36] and the askema (scapular), withits twelve crosses in four rows of three, corresponding to the priestlybreast-plate (which, as Chapter 28 of the book of Exodus makes clear, wasadorned with twelve precious stones also arranged in four rows of three.37[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts37]All in all, therefore, I found it difficult to disagree with Archbishop DavidMatthew who, in 1947, had described ‘the whole cast of religious expression inEthiopia as antique and ceremonial and imbued with an undercurrent of Judaicpractice.’38 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts38] It was not until Iparticipated in the Christian Timkat celebrations on 18 and 19 January 1990,however, that the real pervasiveness and power of this undercurrent was finallybrought home to me.The preparations for Timkat were already well advanced when, in themid-afternoon of Thursday 18 January, I slipped through a wildly excited crowd,up a flight of steps and on to the exterior walkway of the church of MedhaneAlem (literally ‘Saviour of the World’). Situated in the oldest part of Gondar,this was a large, circular building laid out in the traditional fashion –somewhat like an archery target if viewed from above – with a series ofconcentric ambulatories surrounding the Holy of Holies (mak’das).This distinctively Ethiopian pattern, as I already knew, was repeated in aslightly different manner in rectangular and octagonal as well as in roundchurches, and had been recognized by scholars as being based ‘on the threefolddivision of the Hebrew Temple’.39 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts39]According to Edward Ullendorff, the first Professor of Ethiopian Studies at theUniversity of London:The outside ambulatory of the three concentric parts of the Abyssinian church iscalled k’ene mahlet, i.e. the place where hymns are sung, [and] corresponds tothe ulam of Solomon’s Temple. The next chamber is the k’eddest, where communionis administered to the people; and the innermost part is the mak’das where thetabot rests and to which only priests have access … This division into threechambers applies to all Abyssinian churches, even to the smallest of them. It isthus clear that the form of the Hebrew sanctuary was preferred by Abyssinians tothe basilica type which was accepted by early Christians elsewhere.40[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts40]Professor Ullendorff declined to speculate as to precisely why the Abyssiniansshould have favoured a pre-Christian model for their Christian churches. As Istepped into the first ambulatory of Medhane Alem, however, it seemed to me thatthe answer was obvious: the Syrian evangelist Frumentius, who was responsiblefor the conversion of the Axumite kingdom and who was appointed as Ethiopia’sfirst archbishop by the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria in AD 331, mustdeliberately have adapted the institutions of the new faith to the pre-existingJudaic traditions of the country.41[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts41] Furthermore, as Ullendorff didadmit:It is clear that these and other traditions, in particular that of the Ark ofthe Covenant at Axum, must have been an integral part of the Abyssinian nationalheritage long before the introduction of Christianity in the fourth century; forit would be inconceivable that a people recently converted from paganism toChristianity (not by a Christian Jew but by the Syrian missionary Frumentius)should thereafter have begun to boast of Jewish descent and to insist onIsraelite connections, customs and institutions.42[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts42]Walking in stockinged feet – since it is considered sacrilege to wear shoesinside any Ethiopian church – I made a circuit of the k’ene mahlet studying thefaded paintings of saints and holy men that adorned its walls: here was SaintGeorge, mounted on his white charger, slaying the dragon; there was GodAlmighty, ‘the Ancient of Days’, surrounded by the ‘living creatures’ describedby the Prophet Ezekiel; here was John baptizing Christ in the Jordan; there theKings and Shepherds at the Manger; and over there Moses receiving the Tables ofthe Law from the hand of God on Mount Sinai.Standing lost in contemplation before a portrayal of the Queen of Sheba’sjourney to Jerusalem, I became aware of the slow, deep throb of a kebero – thelarge oval drum, made of cowskin stretched over a wooden frame, that features inso much of the music of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. To this barbaric soundwas now added a chorus of voices chanting a Ge’ez hymn, and then the mysticjingle of sistra.My curiosity aroused, I proceeded round the ambulatory and, at last, near thedoorway that led inwards to the k’eddest, I came across a group of priests anddeacons gathered about the drummer, who was seated cross-legged on the floorhunched over his kebero.This was a strange and archaic scene: nothing about it belonged to the modernworld and, as I watched, I felt myself transported backwards through time,riding the eerie waveforms of the music – which seemed to me to belong neitherto Africa nor to Christianity but to some other place and to some infinitelyolder faith. Dressed in their traditional white robes and black shoulder-capes,leaning on tall prayer sticks, the deacons swayed and chanted, swayed andchanted, absorbed in the primal cadence of the dance. Each held in his hand asilver sistrum which, in the silent interstices between the drum-beats, heraised and then let fall, producing a clear and melodious tintinnabulation.The chanting was antiphonal in form, with phrases uttered by one group ofsingers being given their response by others, a dialogue in which verses andchoruses were passed back and forth amongst the participants allowing the hymnto build to its ponderous crescendo. This same system, I knew, had been anestablished part of the Jewish liturgy in Old Testament times.43[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts43]As I was reflecting on this coincidence a fragrant cloud of incense billowedfrom the open door of the k’eddest. Edging forward I looked inside and saw aswirling figure wrapped in robes of green embroidered with golden threads, afigure out of a dream, half sorcerer, half priest, who whirled and turned withdrooping eyes.Gathered round him were other men, similarly attired, each holding a smokingcenser suspended in a fine net of silver chain. I strained my eyes to lookbeyond these figures through the fumes and darkness and could just make out, atthe very centre of the k’eddest, the curtained entrance to the Holy of Holies. Iknew that beyond that heavy veil, venerated and mysterious, guarded bysuperstition, concealed and secret within its sanctuary, lay the tabot – thesymbol of the Ark of the Covenant. And I was reminded that in ancient Israel theHigh Priest could not approach the Ark unless he had first burnt sufficientquantities of incense to cover it completely with smoke.44[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts44] The thick fumes were thoughtnecessary to protect his life – necessary to ensure, as the book of Leviticusrather chillingly put it, ‘that he die not.’45[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts45]I stepped across the threshold into the k’eddest to get a closer look at whatwas going on there but was almost immediately waved back into the outerambulatory. At the same time the song of the deacons ceased, the drum-beatsstilled and, for a moment, absolute silence fell.I could sense an intangible atmosphere of imminence, as though a huge charge oflightning were building up within a thundercloud. A general stirring andmovement then ensued, with people scurrying in all directions. At the same timea smiling priest took my arm lightly but firmly, and guided me out of thek’eddest, through the k’ene mahlet, to the main door of the church where I stoodblinking in the brilliant afternoon sunlight, amazed at the rapid change of moodthat seemed to have overtaken the proceedings.The crowd, big enough when I had arrived, had now swelled into a huge multitudethat completely filled the extensive compound in which Medhane Alem was situatedand that also spilled out on to the road as far as I could see. Men and women,small children, the very elderly, lame people, obviously sick and dying people,laughing, happy, healthy people – half of Ethiopia seemed to be here. Manyclutched musical instruments of one kind or another: cymbals and trumpets,flutes and fiddles, lyres and biblical harps.Moments after my own exit from the church, a group of richly robed priestsappeared. These were the same men whom I had last seen amidst the incense cloudbefore the drawn veil of the Holy of Holies, but now one of them – slender andbearded with fine, delicate features and smouldering eyes – bore on his head thetabot wrapped in costly brocades of red and gold.At once the crowd erupted into a frenzy of shouts and stamping feet and, fromthe women, shrill ululations – a rousing, tremulous vibration that, I knew, hadbeen connected by more than one scholar to ‘certain musical utterances inancient Hebrew worship (Hebrew hallel, Ethiopic ellel) … the mode of exultationis to repeat the sound ellel many times, saying ellellellellellell, etc.… Theproper meaning of “Halleluyah” will probably be “sing hallel or ellel untoJehovah.” ’46 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts46]After standing at the doorway of the church for some minutes while the agitationof the crowd grew, the priests now wheeled and turned, making a complete circuitof the exterior walkway before descending the flight of steps to ground level.The instant that their feet touched the earth, the multitude parted before them– creating a pathway through which they might pass – and the shouts andululations, the blowing of trumpets, the whistle of flutes, the strumming oflyres, and the jingle of the tambourines built up to a pitch that deafened theear and filled the mind with wonder.I followed as closely as I dared behind the group of priests, drawn along intheir turbulent wake. And though the people were gathered in their hundreds oneither side of me, though many were intoxicated either by millet beer or by thetumult, though I was repeatedly jostled, and though more than once I was almostknocked off my feet, I did not for a second feel threatened or alarmed.Sometimes funnelled through narrow alleyways, sometimes spreading out acrosspatches of open land, sometimes stopping inexplicably, sometimes fast, sometimesslow, always bursting with music and song, we progressed through the ancientcity. And all the time I struggled to keep my eyes fixed on the red and goldwrappings of the tabot, which was now far ahead of me. For a while, as a newhorde of revellers joined us from a side street, I completely lost sight of thesacred object. Then standing on tiptoe, craning my neck, I found it and hurriedforward. Determined not to be separated from it again I scrambled up a grassybank, put on a burst of speed, overtook a massed block of two or three hundredpeople, skidded past the priests, and lumbered back down on to the road perhapstwenty yards in front of them.Here I found the reason for the curious stop-start, halting, lurching motion ofthe multitude. In the space ahead of the tabot several impromptu troupes ofdancers had formed themselves – some of mixed sex, some all male, some allfemale, some dressed in everyday working clothes, some in church vestments. Atthe centre of each of these groups was a drummer, his kebero slung around hisneck, beating out an ancient and savage rhythm, whirling, jumping, turning andshouting while those around him exploded with energy, leaping and gyrating,clapping their hands, beating tambourines and cymbals, pouring with sweat asthey capered and reeled.Now, urged on by trumpet blasts and by shouts, by the thrum of a ten-stringedbegegna47 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts47] and the haunting tonesof a shepherd’s flute, a young man dressed in traditional robes of white cottonperformed a wild solo dance while the priests stood in their place stopping theeager crowd behind them and bearing the sacred tabot aloft. Beautiful in hislithe vigour, splendid in his ferocious energy, the youth seemed entranced. Withall eyes upon him he circled the pulsing kebero, pirouetting and swaying,shoulders jerking, head bobbing, lost in his own inner rhythms, praising Godwith every limb, with every ounce of his strength, with every particle of hisbeing. And I thought … this was what it must have been like, three thousandyears ago at the gates of Jerusalem whenDavid and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord with shouting,and with the sound of the trumpet [and] played before the Lord on all manner ofinstruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels,and on cornets, and on cymbals … and David danced before the Lord with all hismight … leaping and dancing before the Lord.48[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts48]In mid-stride, without any warning, the youth collapsed and sank to the groundin a dead faint. He was picked up by several of the spectators, carried to theroadside and made comfortable. Then the crowd surged forward again much asbefore, with new dancers constantly taking the place of those who wereexhausted.Soon afterwards a transition occurred. After tumbling and charging down a lastnarrow street the crowd debouched into a huge open square. And into this samesquare, from three other directions, I could see three other processions alsoapproaching – each of which was similar in size to our own, each of which wascentred upon a tabot borne up by a group of priests, and each of which seemedinspired by the same transcendent spirit.Like four rivers meeting, the separate processions now converged and mixed. Thepriest carrying the tabot from the church of Medhane Alem – whom I had followedfaithfully thus far – stood in line with other priests carrying the tabotat fromthree of the other principal churches of Gondar. Behind this first sacred rankwere more priests and deacons. And behind them again were the assembledcongregations, forming an army that could not have been less than ten thousandstrong.Almost as soon as the processions had joined we were on the move again, wellingforth out of the square and down a steep, broad highway with the tabotat aheadof us. Now and then children would be pushed close to me and would shyly take myhands, walk with me for a while and then release me … An old woman approachedand addressed me at length in Amharic, smiling toothlessly … Two teenage girls,giggling and nervous, touched my blond hair with fascinated curiosity and thenrushed off … And in this fashion, entirely caught up in the gaiety and power ofthe occasion, I allowed myself to be swept along, oblivious to the passing hoursof the afternoon.Then, quite suddenly, an imposing walled compound set amidst grassy woodsappeared around a bend in the track like an image out of a legend. At somedistance behind the surrounding ramparts, I thought that I could just make outthe turrets of a great castle – turrets high and ‘marvellously embattled’. Notfor the first time in my travels in Ethiopia I was hauntingly reminded of thewondrous Grail sanctuary described by Wolfram von Eschenbach – of the‘impregnable stronghold’ with its ‘clusters of towers and numerous palaces’ thathad stood at the edge of a mysterious lake in the realm of Munsalvaesche.49[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts49]At the centre of the enclosure wall was a narrow arched gateway through whichthose ahead of me in the procession now began to stream – and towards which Ifelt myself irresistibly drawn. Indeed there was a tremendous force andcompulsion in this human flow, as though we were being sucked helter-skelterinto a vortex.As I was impelled beneath the arch, jostled and crushed by the scrum of eagerbodies, I was shoved momentarily against rough stone and my wristwatch wasknocked off; almost immediately, however, some unknown person behind me managedto retrieve it from the ground and pressed it back into my hand. Before I couldthank or even identify my benefactor I burst through the bottleneck and arrived,slightly dazed, on the wide and open lawns within the compound. In the samesecond the enormous constriction and compression was relieved and I experienceda delicious sense of freedom …The compound was rectangular in shape and covered an area as large as four cityblocks. Set in the midst of this great grassy space was a second walledenclosure about one-third of the size of the first – which in turn contained thetall, turreted castle that I had glimpsed earlier and, to the rear and sides ofthis structure, a man-made lake half filled with water. The castle itself hadbeen built by Emperor Fasilidas in the seventeenth century and appeared to beaccessible only by way of a narrow stone bridge that passed over a deep moat andthat led directly to a massive wooden doorway set into the front of thebuilding.The crowd, I noticed, was still pouring through the narrow archway that I hadnegotiated a few moments before, and people milled about apparently aimlessly,greeting one another with boisterous and high-spirited bonhomie. Off to myright, directly in front of the castle, a large group of priests and deacons hadgathered and I could see that they now carried a total of seven tabotat. Itherefore surmised that processions from three other Gondarene churches must atsome point en route have joined with the original four that had converged in thecity’s main square earlier in the afternoon.The priests bearing the wrapped tabotat on their heads stood in line,shoulder-to-shoulder. Directly behind them were many more priests who held upbrightly coloured ceremonial umbrellas that were fringed at the edges anddecorated with crosses, stars, suns, crescent moons and other curious devices.Five metres to the left were two further rows of priests, facing each other,carrying long prayer sticks and silver sistra. And between these latter two rowssat a drummer hunched over his kebero.As I edged closer to get a better view, the facing rows of priests began a slowswaying dance before the tabotat – a dance acted out to the same mesmerizingrhythm and to the same antiphonal chanting that I had heard earlier in thechurch of Medhane Alem. A few moments later the dance broke up as suddenly as ithad begun, the dancers dispersed and the priests bearing the seven tabotatproceeded majestically on to the stone bridge that led over the moat and intothe castle. They paused there for a moment, caught in a warm ray of light fromthe descending sun, and the women in the crowd gave vent to more wildululations. Then, on oiled hinges, the heavy wooden door of the fortress swungsilently open – affording me a transient glimpse of the shadowy interior – andthe tabotat were carried inside.Gradually, almost gently, the assembled thousands began to settle down aroundthe gardens. Some had brought blankets, others cotton shemmas (shawls) andthicker woollen gebbis (cloaks). All, however, had the look of people who weregoing to be here for the duration of the Timkat holiday, and all seemed at peacewith themselves – calm now after the effort and exultation of the processionsand prepared for the vigil ahead.By 9 p.m. numerous camp fires had been lit. Around the flickering flames peoplewrapped in shemmas and blankets huddled and murmured secretively – their words,in the old Semitic language of Ethiopia, turning to chill mist as they spoke.Braced and exhilarated by the cold Afro-Alpine air, I sat down on the grass,reclined, pillowed my head on my hands and gazed upwards, delighting in theclouds of stars that had ascended the sky. My thoughts drifted for a while, thenfocussed on the sound of water gushing steadily into the lake somewhere quiteclose to where I sat. At almost the same moment, from within the old castle, asoft cadenced chanting and drumming rose up – an eldritch, heart-stoppingresonance that was at first so faint and so muted that I could barely make itout.I stood and moved closer to the bridge over the moat. It was not my intention tocross it (I did not think that I would be permitted to do so); rather I hopedmerely to find a vantage point from which I might hear the archaic music moreclearly. Inexplicably, however, I felt many hands pushing me forward – pushingme firmly but gently – and soon I found myself on the bridge. There a child ledme to the towering door, opened it and indicated with a smile that I shouldproceed within.Rather timidly I crossed the threshold into a large, square, high-ceilinged,incense-fragrant room illuminated by dozens of candles mounted in niches in therough stone walls. A wintry current insinuated itself under the door that I hadnow closed behind me and on all sides cold draughts pushed through chinks andgaps in the masonry, causing the little flames to gutter and dim.In this ghostly half-light I could make out the robed and hooded figures ofperhaps fifty people standing in ranks two-deep and forming an almost completecircle that was broken only by the doorway in which I stood. Though it wasdifficult to be certain it seemed to me that all these folk were men and thatmost of them were either priests or deacons, for they held prayer sticks andsistra and were chanting a Ge’ez psalm so poignant and so evocative that itcaused the hairs at the nape of my neck to prickle and stand erect. Directly infront of me, on flagstones strewn with freshly cut grass, sat a drummer wrappedin a white shemma, striking the stretched skin of a kebero with a quiet butinsistent beat.Now, without any break in tempo, several members of the choir beckoned to me andI felt myself pulled into their circle, warmed in, made a part of it all. Asistrum was pushed into my right hand, a prayer stick into my left and the chantcontinued, with the singers swaying very gently and very slowly from side toside.Involuntarily I felt my own body beginning to acquaint itself with the rhythm.Watching the others, shedding all self-consciousness, I raised and let fall mysistrum between the drum beats, and as I did so the little metal disks in theancient instrument produced a tuneless, rattling jingle. This oddly compellingsound, I knew, was older by far than the Temple of Solomon, was older even thanthe Pyramids – for sistra just like these had first been used in pre-dynasticEgypt50 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts50] and had passed fromthere, by way of the priestly guilds of Pharaonic times, into the liturgy ofIsrael.How strange this solemn ceremony was, and stranger still that I should have beenallowed to participate in it, here in the heart of the Ethiopian highlands atthe edge of a sacred lake. With a shiver of excitement I realized that there wasnothing in the scene unfolding around me – absolutely nothing at all – thatbelonged to the twentieth century AD. I might just as easily have been a witnessto the arcane rituals of the tenth century BC when the Ark of God was placed bySolomon in the ‘thick darkness’ of the Holy of Holies and when the priests,Being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood atthe east end of the altar [making] one sound to be heard in praising andthanking the Lord; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets andcymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good;for his mercy endureth for ever.51[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts51]Was it not in just this fashion that the priests of Ethiopia – in whose midst Istood – now also praised the Lord? And was it not with just such fervour andconviction that they thanked Him for His mercy and blessed His ineffable name,singing:Rise Yahweh God, come to your resting place,You and the Ark of your power.Your priests, Yahweh God, are vested in salvation,Your faithful rejoice in prosperity.52[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts52]The night passed with a dreamlike sense of real and impossible things randomlymixed up together. There were moments when I hallucinated that the Ark itselfwas concealed somewhere within the old castle. In my heart, however, I also knewthat I had not yet come to the end of my journey, that the Ark was not here inGondar, and that I still had miles and months to go before I could even hope toapproach it. For the present I would have to content myself with the tabotatthat reposed somewhere within the castle – with the seven cloth-wrapped bundlesthat the alchemy of blind faith had effortlessly transformed in the pasttwenty-four hours into objects of immense symbolic weight.Before dawn the priests ushered me out of the castle and back over the narrowbridge. As light gradually began to infuse the sky I then spent an hour or soexploring the great compound. If there had been ten thousand people there theevening before there were hardly fewer now. Some walked and talked in twos andthrees, others stood around in large huddled groups, others still warmedthemselves by the pale flames of the fading fires. And I thought that I coulddetect again the same mood of expectancy, the same sense of eager and restlessanticipation, that had preceded the bringing out of the tabot at the church ofMedhane Alem the previous afternoon.I made a complete circuit of the inner compound that surrounded the castle andthe lake. Reaching the far side of the complex I then climbed the enclosure walland looked down at a scene both beautiful and bizarre. Below me an earthenembankment perhaps five feet wide ran all the way around the still and shiningwaters, and on this embankment – on every square inch of it – people stoodwatchfully, waiting for something to happen, their shimmering reflections pickedout by the risen sun.A balcony projected at the rear of the castle and now, on to this balcony, outof a cloud of incense, stepped a group of priests dressed in splendid robes ofgreen and red. Loud ululations arose from the crowd and a short ceremony ensuedwhich (I learned later) served to bless and consecrate the waters. Then, withamazing suddenness – and apparently oblivious to the morning chill – peoplebegan to hurl themselves into the lake. Some leapt in fully clothed, somecompletely undressed. Here a young woman with ripe breasts thrust her naked babybeneath the surface and brought him up again, coughing and spluttering, in ashower of droplets. There, with movements that were brittle and precise, an oldman, lean and wizened, crooked and infirm, waded in up to his chest. Here agroup of teenage boys swam and sported. There a middle-aged matron, stripped tothe waist, lashed her back and shoulders with a dampened branch … Meanwhile,from the main compound in front of the castle, a roar of excitement could beheard as others in their thousands came to join the throng, to splash and dive,to plunge and frolic.I climbed down from my vantage point on the wall and rushed round to the frontof the compound. Amidst all this distraction what I wanted to do was to get backinside the castle. The tabotat had not been in the place where I had spent mostof the night singing and chanting, dancing and swaying – so where were they? Andwhat would happen next?Unnoticed by the near-hysterical crowd, I crossed the bridge over the moat,pushed open the door and stepped inside; as I did so I observed that the floorof the great room was still strewn with grass and that its walls were blackenedwith candle smoke. It was now perhaps 7 a.m. and bright sunlight streamed in,startling a group of deacons who had gathered there. Opposite me there was acurtain drawn across an arch which I had not seen during the night, and nowthrough this curtain a priest appeared. He regarded me quizzically, then smiledand seemed to offer a welcome.I walked up to him and signalled that I would like to pass through beyond theveil. At this, however, he shook his head vehemently. ‘No,’ he whispered inEnglish. ‘No. Impossible. Tabot inside.’ Then he withdrew again behind thecurtain, beyond which I thought that I could just make out faint stirrings andfootfalls.I called out, hoping to attract the attention of someone in authority, but gotno response. Then – crassly – I put my hand on the curtain and made to open it.At this three of the deacons standing in the room behind me leapt on me, grabbedme by the arms and wrestled me to the floor where I received several severebruises.I cursed and struggled, not thinking clearly, aware only that I was dazed andshocked: just a few hours earlier I had been made to feel so much at home here;now I was being beaten up. With some difficulty I shook my assailants off andpulled myself to my feet. This action, however, was misinterpreted as theprelude to another attempt on the curtain and I was pummelled and buffeted whileseveral more deacons blocked my way. ‘Cannot go in there,’ one of them warned,indicating the room beyond the veil. ‘Only priests to go inside.’ He wagged hisfinger at me and added: ‘You are very bad man.’I was then unceremoniously bundled out of the castle door and deposited roughlyon the narrow bridge in front of several thousand frowning people – and Ithought: if I get into this much trouble just for trying to enter a room wheresome tabotat are kept, then what on earth is going to happen to me in Axum whenI try to see the Ark itself?I crossed the bridge, picked my way through the crowd and stood on a patch ofclear ground, shaking slightly because of the adrenalin that was pumping throughmy bloodstream. Taking stock I could see that many people were still in thelake, and I could hear splashes and shouts. The majority, however, were now outof the water and assembled on the broad lawns in front of the castle, leaningforward avidly, craning their necks, excited and yet oddly silent.Then seven fully robed priests appeared at the castle door with wrapped tabotatbalanced on their heads. Slowly and deliberately they stepped out on to thebridge and made their way across, followed by yet more priests holding upceremonial umbrellas. At the same moment the crowd gave vent to a hugecollective sigh, an ardent gasp of awe and devotion that was soon enhanced bythe familiar high-pitched ululations of the women and by an urgent, distractedjostling as people scrambled backwards and sideways to clear a path for theadvancing tabotat.As the morning wore on and as the sun rose towards its zenith I followed theprocession back through the streets of Gondar as far as the main square of theold city. There the dance of David before the Ark was again enacted amidstshouting and the sounds of tambourines and cymbals, amidst the blowing oftrumpets and the music of sistra and stringed instruments.Then finally the priests carrying the seven tabotat wheeled and separated. Asthey did so the multitude too divided itself into seven different parts – sevendifferent processions that now streamed out of the square in seven differentdirections.Running to keep up, panting and sweating, I followed close behind the tabot ofMedhane Alem, followed it all the way back to the old round church and there,amidst a thousand exuberant songs and dances, watched as the priest who bore itcircled the building once, circled it twice, and then at last, to a tremendousroar of joy and approbation, vanished from my sight into the darkness within –into the Holy of Holies, into the mystery of mysteries.A YEAR’S REPRIEVE …I left Gondar in January 1990, quite certain that I was right to seek the Ark inEthiopia. Despite a thin and superficial Christian veneer, the central role ofthe tabotat in the ceremonies that I had witnessed, the strange dances of thepriests, the frenzied adulation of the laity, the archaic music of sistra and oftambourines, of trumpets, drums and cymbals, were all phenomena lifted straightout of the most distant and recondite past. And it seemed to me then, as itseems to me now, that these intricate rituals, these complex institutions – allof them focussed upon the Old Testament worship of the Ark of the Covenant –would not have been adhered to with such fervour and fidelity over so many wearycenturies if all that lay behind them were mere replicas.No. The Ethiopians had the Ark itself. Perhaps in the way described in the KebraNagast, or perhaps by some other more historically probable means that I mightin due course be able to identify, it had come into their possession in thefirst millennium BC. And now, so near the end of the second millennium AD, theyhad it still, hidden away, concealed from prying eyes.But where?’In answering this last question I felt that I could not ignore the implicationsof my own research: the sacred relic was not on an island in Lake Zwai; it wasnot on an island in Lake Tana; instead all the evidence suggested that it laystill in its traditional resting place – safe in the Holy of Holies of thesanctuary chapel at Axum. There could be no absolute certainty, of course, but Ifelt sure in my own mind that I was right. And twelve months hence, when Timkatcame around again in January 1991, I would have to go to Axum to seek it – andto see it if I could.I felt a sense of inevitability about this, as though a challenge had been laiddown – laid down as clearly and as compellingly as the Green Knight’s taunt toSir Gawain:I am known to many, so if to find me thou endeavour, thou’lt fail not to do so.Therefore come! Or to be called a craven thou deservest.… Yet a respite I’llallow, till a year and a day go by.53[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts53]And what would I do in my period of reprieve, in my year of grace? I would, Idetermined, learn everything I could about the baleful object that beckoned tome – about its origins, and about its powers. I would study the Ark of God and Iwould attempt to discover whether there might not be a rational explanation forthe terrors and the miracles that it was believed to have worked in OldTestament times."},{"pageContent":"PART IV: EGYPT, 1989–90A MONSTROUSINSTRUMENT"},{"pageContent":"[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_m04_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12MAGIC … OR METHOD?During 1989 and 1990, as I immersed myself ever more deeply in the mysteries ofthe lost Ark of the Covenant, I became interested not only in where it was butalso in what it was. Naturally I turned first to the Bible, where the earliestmention of the Ark occurs during the period of the ‘wilderness wanderings’immediately after the prophet Moses had led the children of Israel out of theircaptivity in Egypt (around 1250 BC1[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts1]). In Chapter 25 of the book ofExodus we read that the precise dimensions of the sacred relic and the materialsto be used in its construction were revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai by GodHimself:You are to make me an Ark of acacia wood two and a half cubits long, one and ahalf cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high [i.e. a rectangular chestmeasuring three feet nine inches by two feet three inches by two feet threeinches2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts2]]. You are to plate it,inside and out, with pure gold, and decorate it all around with a gold moulding.You will cast four gold rings for the Ark and fix them to its four supports [orcorners3 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts3]]: two rings on one sideand two rings on the other. You will also make shafts of acacia wood plated withgold and pass the shafts through the rings on the sides of the Ark, to carry theArk by these. The shafts must remain in the rings of the Ark and not bewithdrawn … Further you are to make a throne of mercy, of pure gold, two and ahalf cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide. For the two ends of thisthrone of mercy you are to make two golden cherubim; you are to make them ofbeaten gold. Make the first cherub for one end and the second for the other, andfasten them to the two ends of the throne of mercy so that they may make onepiece with it. The cherubim are to have their wings spread upwards so that theyovershadow the throne of mercy. They must face one another, their faces towardsthe throne of mercy. You must place the throne of mercy on top of theArk … There I shall come to meet you: there from above the throne of mercy, frombetween the two cherubim that are on the Ark.4[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts4]This ‘divine blueprint’ is, surely, one of the very strangest passages in theBible. After receiving it, Moses passed it on verbatim to an artificer namedBezaleel, a man ‘filled with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding,and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works.’5[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts5] Bezaleel made the Ark exactly asspecified.6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts6] Then, when it wasready, Moses placed inside it the two tablets of stone, also given to him onMount Sinai, on which God had inscribed the Ten Commandments.7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts7] The sacred object, now pregnantwith its precious contents, was then installed behind a ‘veil’ in the Holy ofHolies of the Tabernacle8 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts8] – theportable tent-like structure that the Israelites used as their place of worshipduring their wanderings in the wilderness.THE TERRORS AND THE MIRACLESSoon terrible things began to happen. The first concerned Nadab and Abihu, twoof the four sons of Aaron the High Priest, who was Moses’s own brother. Asmembers of the priestly family they enjoyed access to the Holy of Holies, intowhich they one day advanced carrying metal incense burners in their hands.9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts9] There, according to the book ofLeviticus they ‘offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded themnot’.10 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts10] The devastatingconsequence was that a flame leapt out from the Ark ‘and devoured them and theydied.’11 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts11]And the Lord spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, whenthey offered before the Lord and died; And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak untoAaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within theveil before the throne of mercy, which is upon the Ark; that he die not: for Iwill appear in the cloud upon the throne of mercy.12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts12]The throne of mercy – ‘mercy seat’ in some translations – was the slab of puregold that served as the Ark’s cover. The reader will recall that mounted oneither end of it – and facing each other – were two golden figures of cherubim.‘The cloud upon the throne of mercy’ which threatened death to Aaron musttherefore have been visible between the cherubim. It was not always present, buton those occasions when it did materialize the Israelites believed ‘that thedemons held sway’13 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts13] – and theneven Moses would not dare to approach.14[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts14]Other supposedly supernatural phenomena also manifested themselves ‘between thecherubim’ that faced each other across the Ark’s golden lid. For example, just afew days15 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts15] after the unfortunatedemise of Aaron’s two sons, Moses went into the Holy of Holies of theTabernacle, which was then still pitched in the shadow of Mount Sinai. After hehad entered, the prophet ‘heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off themercy seat that was upon the Ark … from between the two cherubim.’16[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts16] Certain very ancient Jewishlegends state that this voice came from heaven ‘in the form of a tube offire’.17 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts17] And fire – in one guiseor another, with and without the deadly cloud – seems often to have beenassociated with the cherubim. According to an enduring folk memory, for example,‘two sparks [elsewhere described as “fiery jets”] issued from the cherubim whichshaded the Ark’ – sparks which occasionally burned and destroyed nearbyobjects.18 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts18]Eventually the time came for the Israelites to abandon their camp at the foot ofMount Sinai – also called the ‘Mountain of Yahweh’ (after the name of God):They set out from the mountain of Yahweh and journeyed for three days. The Arkof the Covenant of Yahweh went at their head for this journey of three days,searching out a camping place for them … And as the Ark set out, Moses wouldsay, ‘Arise Yahweh, may your enemies be scattered and those who hate you run fortheir lives before you!’ And as it came to rest, he would say, ‘Come back,Yahweh, to the thronging hosts of Israel.’19[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts19]Travelling at the head of the Israelite column, the sacred relic was borne onthe shoulders of ‘the Kohathites’ (or ‘sons of Kohath’), a sub-clan of the tribeof Levi to which both Moses and Aaron also belonged. According to severallegends, and to rabbinical commentaries on the Old Testament, these bearers wereoccasionally killed by the ‘sparks’ which the Ark emitted20[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts20] and, in addition, were liftedbodily off the ground from time to time because ‘the Ark [was] able to carry itscarriers as well as itself.’21 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts21]Nor is this the only Jewish tradition to suggest that the Ark might have beenable to exert a mysterious force that in some way was able to counteractgravity. Several other pieces of learned Midrashic exegesis also testify that itsometimes lifted its bearers off the ground (thus temporarily relieving them ofwhat would otherwise have been a considerable burden).22[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts22] In a similar vein a particularlystriking Jewish legend reports an incident during which the priests attemptingto carry the Ark were ‘tossed by an invisible agency into the air and flung tothe ground again and again.’23 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts23]Another tradition describes an occasion when ‘the Ark leaped of itself into theair’.24 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts24]Imbued as it was with such strange energies it is little wonder, throughouttheir wanderings in the wilderness, that the Israelites were able to use the Arkas a weapon – a weapon with powers so terrible that it could bring victory evenwhen the odds seemed overwhelming.25[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts25] An account of one such battledescribes the Ark as first uttering ‘a moaning sound’, then rising up off theground and rushing towards the enemy26[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts26] – who not surprisingly wereplunged into disarray and slaughtered on the spot. On another occasion, however– and as though to prove the rule – the Israelites were themselves defeated.This happened, according to the Bible, because they did not have the Ark withthem at the time – Moses had withheld it from them after advising them againstmounting an assault in that particular area:They set out presumptuously towards the heights of the highlands. Neither theArk of the Covenant of Yahweh nor Moses left the camp. Then the Amalekites camedown … which dwelt in that hill country, and smote them and discomfited them.27[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts27]According to the Bible, forty years were spent in the wilderness,28[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts28] years during which the Israeliteslearned that it was in their interests to follow Moses’s advice to the letter.There-after, under his leadership and with the help of the Ark, theysuccessfully subdued the fierce tribes of the Sinai peninsula, conqueredTransjordania, spoiled the Midianites,29[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts29] and generally laid waste to allthose who opposed them. Finally, towards the end of their four decades ofwandering, they ‘pitched their camp in the plains of Moab … opposite Jericho.’30[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts30]Just across the Jordan river, the Promised Land was now in sight. By this timeMoses’s brother Aaron had already died31[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts31] and had been replaced in theoffice of High Priest by Eleazar.32[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts32] Meanwhile Moses himself had beenforewarned by Yahweh that it was not his destiny to enter Canaan and,accordingly, had invested ‘Joshua, the son of Nun’ as his successor.33[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts33]Soon afterwards Moses died,34 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts34] butnot before he had initiated Joshua into the mysteries of the Ark of theCovenant.35 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts35] The new leadertherefore had a formidable weapon at his disposal to deploy against the fierceresistance that he was about to encounter in the heavily fortified city ofJericho.Joshua seemed to know that the Ark was a two-edged sword – that, if not properlyhandled, it could harm the Israelites as well as their enemies. Early in thecampaign, while he was planning the advance across the Jordan river towardsJericho, he sent his officers throughout the camp to tell the people this:When ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests theLevites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place and go after it. Yetthere shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure:come not near unto it …36 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts36]Then, when all was prepared:Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the Ark of the Covenant, and passover before the people … And it came to pass … as they that bare the Ark werecome unto Jordan … [that] the waters which came from above stood and rose upupon an heap … and those that came down were cut off … and the priests that barethe Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst ofJordan … And … when the priests … were come up out of the midst of Jordan andthe soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up onto the dry land … the waters ofJordan returned unto their place … And [Joshua] spake … saying … the Lord yourGod dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over.37[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts37]Anyone reared in the Judaeo-Christian tradition will be familiar with thedetails of the assault on Jericho that followed the triumphal crossing of theJordan. While the main mass of the people stood back at the obligatory distanceof two thousand cubits (more than half a mile), a hand-picked group of priestsblowing trumpets marched around the walls of the city bearing the Ark. Thisprocedure was repeated every day for six days. Then:On the seventh day … they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassedthe city after the same manner … only on that day they compassed the city seventimes. And … at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets,Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city … Sothe people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass,when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with agreat shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into thecity … and they took the city … and they utterly destroyed all that was in thecity.38 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts38]In the wilderness, when it was new, the Ark was nigh-on invincible, and duringJoshua’s campaigns in the Promised Land the biblical testimony suggests that itcontinued to play a significant military role long after the fall of Jericho.39[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts39] Within about a hundred and fiftyyears of Joshua’s death, however, a change took place: a close examination ofthe relevant books of the Old Testament shows that, by this time, the relic wasno longer routinely being carried into battle; instead it had been installed (inits Tabernacle) at an important shrine-sanctuary known as Shiloh, where itrested permanently.40 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts40]The reason for this change was the increasing power and confidence of theIsraelites themselves who, by the eleventh century BC, had managed to capture,settle and control most of the Promised Land and who evidently felt that it wasno longer necessary in such circumstances for them to bring out their secretweapon.41 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts41]This self-assurance, however, proved misplaced on one significant occasion – thebattle of Ebenezer, at which the Israelites were defeated by the Philistines andfour thousand of their men were killed.42[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts42] After this débâcle:The troops returned to the camp and the elders of Israel said … ‘Let us fetchthe Ark of our God from Shiloh so that it may come among us and rescue us fromthe power of our enemies.’43 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts43]This suggestion was immediately accepted:So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the Ark of theCovenant of the Lord of Hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubim … and whenthe Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted witha great shout so that the earth rang.44[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts44]Hearing this noise, the Philistines exclaimed:‘What can this great shouting in the Hebrew camp mean?’ And they realized thatthe Ark of Yahweh had come into the camp. At this the Philistines were afraid;and they said, ‘God has come to the camp’. ‘Alas!’ they cried. ‘This has neverhappened before. Alas! Who will save us from the power of this mighty God?… Buttake courage and be men, Philistines, or you will become slaves to theHebrews … Be men and fight.’45 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts45]Battle was joined again and, to the utter astonishment of all concerned:Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a verygreat slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. And the Arkof God was taken.46 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts46]This was truly a catastrophe. Never before had the Israelites suffered defeatwhen they had carried the Ark into battle and never before had the Ark itselfbeen captured. Such an eventuality had been unthinkable, unimaginable – and yetit had happened.As the Philistines bore the relic triumphantly away, a runner was sent to carrythe bad news to Eli, the High Priest, who had remained behind at Shiloh:And … lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching … Now Eli was ninety andeight years old and his eyes were dim that he could not see. And the man saidunto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.And he said, What is there done, my son? And the messenger answered and said,Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a greatslaughter among the people … and the Ark of God is taken.When he mentioned the Ark of God, Eli fell backward off his seat … His neck wasbroken and he died, for he was old and heavy.[And] his daughter-in-law … was with child and near her time. When she heard thenews that the Ark of God had been captured … she crouched down and gave birth,for her labour pains came on.47 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts47]The child thus born was called Ichabod meaning ‘where is the glory?’48[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts48] This curious name was chosen, theBible explained, because the mother had given vent to a great cry of grief whenshe had received the information about the loss of the Ark: ‘And she said, Theglory is departed from Israel: for the Ark of God is taken.’49[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts49]Even stranger and more alarming events were to follow:When the Philistines had captured the Ark of God they brought it from Ebenezerto Ashdod. Taking the Ark of God, the Philistines put it in the temple of [theirdeity] Dagon, setting it down beside [the statue of] Dagon. Next morning thepeople of Ashdod went to the temple of Dagon and there lay Dagon face down onthe ground before the Ark of Yahweh. They picked Dagon up and put him back inhis place. But early next morning there lay Dagon face down again upon theground before the Ark of Yahweh, and Dagon’s head and two hands were lyingsevered on the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left in its place. This iswhy the priests of Dagon and indeed all who enter Dagon’s temple do not step onthe threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to the present day.The hand of Yahweh weighed heavily on the people of Ashdod and struck terrorinto them, afflicting them with tumours, in Ashdod and its territory. When themen of Ashdod saw what was happening they said, ‘The Ark of the God of Israelmust not stay here with us, for his hand lies heavy on us and on Dagon our god.’So they summoned all the Philistine chiefs to them, and said, ‘What shall we dowith the Ark of the God of Israel?’ They decided, ‘The Ark of the God of Israelmust go to Gath.’ So they took the Ark of the God of Israel to Gath. But afterthey had taken it there, the hand of Yahweh lay heavy on that town and a greatpanic broke out; the people of the town, from youngest to oldest, were struckwith tumours that he brought out on them. They then sent the Ark of God toEkron, but when it came to Ekron the Ekronites shouted, ‘They have brought usthe Ark of the God of Israel to bring death to us and our people.’ They summonedall the Philistine chiefs and said, ‘Send the Ark of the God of Israel away; letit not bring death to us and our people’ – for there was mortal panic throughoutthe town; the hand of God was very heavy there. The people who did not die werestruck with tumours and the wailing from the town went up to heaven.50[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts50]Shattered by the horrible afflictions that they had suffered because of therelic, the Philistines eventually decided – after seven months51[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts51] – to ‘send it back to where itbelongs’.52 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts52] To this end theyloaded it onto a ‘new cart’ hauled by ‘two milch kine’53[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts53] and set it rumbling on its waytowards Bethshemesh, the nearest point inside Israelite territory.54[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts54]Another disaster soon followed, and this time the Philistines were not thevictims:They of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and theylifted up their eyes, and saw the Ark, and rejoiced to see it. And the cart cameunto the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was agreat stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificedsacrifices the same day unto the Lord … [But] he smote the men of Bethshemeshbecause they had looked into the Ark of the Lord, even he smote of the peoplefifty thousand and threescore and ten men; and the people lamented because theLord had smitten many of the people with great slaughter.55[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts55]The text quoted above is from the King James Authorized Version of the Bible,produced in the early seventeenth century. Other more recent translations agreethat certain men of Bethshemesh were smitten or ‘struck down’ by the Ark but putthe number slain at seventy rather than fifty thousand and seventy – and it isthe consensus of modern scholarship that this figure is the correct one.56[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts56]Seventy men, therefore, looked into the Ark of the Covenant after it arrived inthe field of Joshua the Bethshemite, and these seventy men died as a result.57[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts57] Nowhere is it stated exactly howthey died; but there can be no doubt that they were killed by the Ark – and in amanner sufficiently dramatic and horrible to lead the survivors to conclude: ‘Noone is safe in the presence of the Lord, this holy God. To whom can we send itto be rid of him?’58 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts58] At thispoint, suddenly and rather mysteriously, a group of Levitical priests appeared,‘took down the Ark of the Lord,’59[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts59] and carried it off – not to itsformer home at Shiloh but instead to a place called ‘Kiriath-Jearim’ where itwas installed in ‘the house of Abinadabon the hill’.60[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts60]And on that hill it remained, isolated and guarded,61[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts61] for the next half century orso.62 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts62] Indeed it was not broughtdown again until David had become King of Israel. A powerful and headstrong man,he had recently captured the city of Jerusalem. Now it was his intention toconsolidate his authority by bringing up to his new capital the most sacredrelic of his people.The date would have been somewhere between 1000 and 990 BC.63[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts63] This is what happened:They placed the Ark of God on a new cart and brought it from Abinadab’s housewhich is on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio … were leading the cart. Uzzah walkedalongside the Ark of God and Ahio went in front … When they came to thethreshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah stretched his hand out to the Ark of God andsteadied it, as the oxen were making it tilt. Then the anger of Yahweh blazedout against Uzzah, and for this crime God struck him down on the spot, and hedied there beside the Ark of God.64[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts64]Quite naturally:David was afraid of the Lord that day and said, ‘How can I harbour the Ark ofthe Lord after this?’ He felt he could not take the Ark of the Lord with him tothe City of David.65 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts65]Instead he ‘turned aside and carried it to the house of Obed-edom theGittite.’66 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts66] At that house, whilethe Jewish monarch waited to see if it would kill anyone else, the Ark of theCovenant remained for three months. No further disasters occurred, however. Onthe contrary: ‘Yahweh blessed Obed-edom and his whole family.’67[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts67] The Scriptures are not explicitabout the nature of this benediction. According to ancient folk traditions,however, ‘it consisted in Obed-edom being blessed with many children … The womenin his house gave birth after a pregnancy of two months only and bore sixchildren at one time.’68 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts68]The Bible takes up the story again as follows:It was told King David, saying, the Lord hath blessed the house of Obed-edom andall that pertaineth unto him, because of the Ark of God. So David went andbrought the Ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David withgladness.69 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts69]On this journey:the children of the Levites bare the Ark of God upon their shoulders with thestaves thereon, as Moses had commanded according to the word of God.70[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts70]Then, finally, David led the joyous procession into Jerusalem ‘with shouting andwith the sound of the trumpet’,71 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts71]and with music played ‘on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even onharps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on coronets, and on cymbals.’72[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts72]It had been David’s hope that he would be able to build a temple in Jerusalem inwhich the Ark could be housed. In the event, however, he was not to fulfil thisambition and instead had to content himself with placing the relic in a simpletent of the type that had been used during the desert wanderings.73[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts73]The honour (or the conceit?) of erecting the Temple was therefore left toanother man. As David himself put it before he died:As for me, I had it in mine heart to build an house of rest for the Ark of theCovenant of the Lord … and had made ready for the building … But God said untome, Thou shalt not build an house for my name … Solomon thy son, he shall buildmy house.74 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts74]This prophecy was duly fulfilled. At Solomon’s command, work was started on theTemple around the year 966 BC75 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts75]and was completed rather more than a decade later, probably in 955 BC.76[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts76] Then, when all was done, the Holyof Holies – a place which the Lord had ordered should be utterly dark – was madeready to receive the precious object that it had been built to contain:Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes … thatthey might bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord … And all the elders ofIsrael came, and the priests took up the Ark. And they brought up the Ark of theLord … And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembledunto him, were with him before the Ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that couldnot be told nor numbered for multitude. And the priests brought in the Ark ofthe Covenant of the Lord to its place in the Temple … in the Holy of Holies.77[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts77]And there the sacred relic remained, enveloped in ‘thick darkness’, until itmysteriously vanished at some unknown date between the tenth and sixth centuriesBC.78 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts78] As I have already indicatedin Chapter 1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c01_r1.htm], absolutely no explanationexists for its disappearance, which scholars regard as one of the great unsolvedriddles of the Bible.79 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts79] Almostequally puzzling, however, are the awesome powers that it seems to havepossessed in its heyday – powers portrayed in the Old Testament as stemmingdirectly from God.DEUS EX MACHINAIn trying to understand the Ark, I found myself returning again and again to theperplexing issue of these powers. What could have accounted for them? It seemedto me that there were three possible answers:1 The Old Testament was right. The Ark was indeed a repository of divineenergies and these energies were the source of all the ‘miracles’ that itperformed.2 The Old Testament was wrong. The Ark was just an ornate casket and thechildren of Israel were the victims of a collective mass hallucination thatlasted for several hundred years.3 The Old Testament was both right and wrong at the same time. The Ark possessedgenuine powers, but those powers were neither ‘supernatural’ nor divine. On thecontrary, they were man-made.I looked into all three options and concluded that I certainly could not acceptthe first unless I was also prepared to accept that Yahweh, the God of theIsraelites, was a psychopathic killer – or a kind of malign genie who lived in abox. Nor could I accept the second – primarily because the Old Testament, whichis a compilation of books codified in widely different periods, was remarkablyconsistent where the Ark was concerned. Throughout the Scriptures it was theonly artefact explicitly and unambiguously portrayed as being imbued withsupernatural energies. All other man-made objects were treated quitematter-of-factly. Indeed even exceptionally holy items such as theseven-branched golden candlestick known as the menorah, the so-called ‘table ofthe showbread’, and the altar upon which sacrifices were performed, were clearlyunderstood to be nothing more than important pieces of ritual furniture.The Ark was therefore quite unique, unrivalled in the special reverence accordedto it by the scribes, and matchless in the awesome deeds attributed to itthroughout the lengthy period in which it completely dominated the biblicalstory. Moreover its alleged powers showed few signs of having fallen victim toimaginative literary embellishment. On the contrary, from the time of itsconstruction at the foot of Mount Sinai until its sudden and unexplaineddisappearance hundreds of years later, it continued to exhibit the samespectacular but limited repertoire. Thus it continued to lift itself, itsbearers, and other objects around it off the ground; it continued to emit light;it continued to be associated with a strange ‘cloud’ that materialized ‘betweenthe cherubim’; it continued to afflict people with ailments like ‘leprosy’80[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts80] and ‘tumours’; and it continuedto kill those who accidentally touched or opened it. Significantly, however, itexhibited none of the other marvellous characteristics that one might haveexpected if a mass hallucination had been involved or if a great deal of fictionhad been allowed to adulterate the record: for example, it did not make rain; itdid not turn water into wine; it did not resurrect the dead; it did not driveout devils; and it did not always win the battles into which it was taken(although it usually did).In other words, throughout its history, it consistently behaved like a powerfulmachine that had been designed to carry out certain very specific tasks and thatonly performed effectively within its design parameters – although even then,like all machines, it was fallible because of defects in its construction andbecause it was subject both to human error and to wear and tear.I therefore formulated the following hypothesis, in line with the thirdalternative set out above: the Old Testament had indeed been both right andwrong at the same time. The Ark had possessed genuine powers, but those powershad been neither supernatural nor divine; on the contrary, they must have beenthe products of human skill and ingenuity.This, of course, was only a theory – a speculation intended to guide my furtherresearch – and it was confronted by a great many legitimate doubts. Mostimportant of all, how could men possibly have manufactured so potent a devicemore than three thousand years ago, when technology and civilization hadsupposedly been at a very rudimentary stage?This question, I felt, lay at the heart of the mystery. In seeking to answer itI found that I had to consider first and foremost the cultural context of thesacred relic – a context that was almost entirely Egyptian. After all, the Arkwas built in the wilderness of Sinai within a very few months after Moses hadled his people out of their captivity in Egypt – a captivity that had lasted formore than four hundred years.81 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts81]It therefore followed that Egypt was the most likely place in which to findclues to the Ark’s true nature.TUTANKHAMEN’S LEGACYI became convinced that I was right about this after I had paid a visit to theCairo Museum. Located in the heart of Egypt’s capital city, close to the eastbank of the Nile, this imposing building is an unequalled repository ofPharaonic artefacts dating back as far as the fourth millennium BC. One of theupper floors is given over to a permanent exhibition of objects recovered fromthe tomb of Tutankhamen, the youthful monarch who ruled Egypt from 1352 to 1343BC – i.e. about a century before the time of Moses.82[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts82] I was entranced by thisexhibition and spent several hours wandering amongst the display cases amazed atthe beauty, variety and sheer quantity of the relics on view. It did notsurprise me to learn that the renowned British archaeologist Howard Carter hadtaken six full years to empty the great sepulchre that he had found in theValley of the Kings in 1922.83 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts83]However, what interested me most of all about the treasures that he hadunearthed was that they included dozens of Ark-like chests or boxes, some withcarrying poles, some without, but all of them conceptually similar to the Ark ofthe Covenant.By far the most striking of these objects were the four shrines that had beenbuilt to contain the sarcophagus of Tutankhamen. These shrines, which I studiedclosely, took the form of large rectangular caskets that had originally beenpositioned one inside the other but that were now installed in separate displaycases. Since each casket was made of wood, and since each, moreover, was plated‘inside and out with pure gold’,84[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts84] it was difficult to resist theconclusion that the mind that had conceived the Ark of the Covenant must havebeen familiar with objects like these.Further support for this inference was provided by the presence on the doors andrear walls of each of the shrines of two mythical figures: tall and terriblewinged women, fierce and imperious in stature and visage – like stern angels ofvengeance. These powerful and commanding creatures, placed so as to provideritual protection for the precious contents of the tomb, were thought to berepresentations of the goddesses Isis and Nephthys.85[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts85] While that identification initself held no special significance for me, I could not help but note that thedeities had their ‘wings spread upwards’ just like the cherubim referred to inthe biblical description of the Ark. They also faced each other just as thebiblical cherubim had done. And although they were shaped in high relief on theflat planes of the doors (rather than being distinct pieces of statuary) theywere nevertheless fashioned ‘of beaten gold’ – again very much like the cherubimdescribed in the Bible.86 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts86]No scholar, I knew, had ever been able to establish exactly what those cherubimhad looked like. There was only consensus that they could in no way haveresembled the chubby angelic ‘cherubs’ of much later western art, which were, atbest, sanitized and Christianized interpretations of a truly ancient and paganconcept.87 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts87] Lost in thought in theCairo Museum, however, it seemed to me that the formidable winged guardians ofTutankhamen’s inter-nested shrines were the closest models that I was everlikely to find for the two cherubim of the Ark, which indeed had been conceivedas standing sentinel over it and which had also frequently served as channelsfor its immense and deadly power.THE TABOTAT OF APETI was subsequently to discover that the Ark’s Egyptian background was wider anddeeper even than this. Tutankhamen had also left another legacy which helped meto understand the full significance of that background. During a visit to thegreat temple at Luxor in Upper Egypt in April 1990, while passing through theelegant colonnade that extends eastwards from the court of Rameses II, I cameacross a story carved in stone – a permanent and richly illustrated account ofthe important ‘Festival of Apet’ which had been inscribed here in the fourteenthcentury BC on Tutankhamen’s direct orders.88[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts88]Although now badly eroded by the passage of the millennia, the faded reliefs onthe west and east walls of the colonnade were still sufficiently visible for meto grasp the rudiments of the festival, which in Tutankhamen’s time had markedthe peak of the annual Nile flood upon which almost all of Egypt’s agriculturedepended.89 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts89] I already knew thatthis perennial inundation (today held back by the Aswan High Dam with profoundlyunfortunate ecological consequences) had been almost exclusively the product ofthe long rainy season in the Ethiopian highlands – a deluge that every yearroared down out of Lake Tana and along the Blue Nile bestowing hundreds ofthousands of tons of rich silt on the farmlands of the Delta and contributing anestimated six-sevenths of the total volume of water in the Nile river system.90[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts90] This opened up the possibilitythat the Apet ceremonials might in some way prove relevant to my quest: afterall, they had celebrated a clear link between the life of ancient Egypt andevents in far-off Ethiopia. Most probably this link had been no more than acoincidental one to do with climate and geography; nevertheless I regarded it asbeing of at least prima facie interest.It turned out to be far more than that.Studying first the western wall of the colonnade on which the Tutankhamenreliefs were displayed, my eye was caught by what appeared to be an Ark, liftedshoulder high on its carrying poles by a group of priests. Stepping closer Iquickly confirmed that this was indeed the case: with the sole proviso that theobject being transported took the form of a miniature boat rather than a casket,the scene before me looked like quite a faithful illustration of the passage inthe first book of Chronicles which states that the Levitical priests of ancientIsrael ‘carried the Ark of God with the shafts on their shoulders as Moses hadordered’.91 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts91]Standing back to get perspective I established that the entire western wall ofthe colonnade was covered with images very similar to the one that had initiallyattracted my attention. In what seemed to be a massive and joyous procession Iwas able to make out the shapes of several different Ark-like boats beingcarried on the shoulders of several different groups of priests, before whommusicians played on sistra and a variety of other instruments, acrobatsperformed, and people danced and sang, clapping their hands in excitement.With my pulse quickening I sat down in a patch of shade around the broken baseof a column and reflected on the implications of the huge sense of déjà vu thathad just overtaken me. It was barely three months since I had attended Timkat inthe Ethiopian city of Gondar on 18 and 19 January 1990. The details of theceremonials that I had witnessed during those two days of religious frenzy weretherefore still fresh in my mind – so fresh in fact that I could hardly fail tonote the similarities between them and the ecstatic procession portrayed on thetime-worn stones of this Egyptian temple. Both events, I realized, focussedaround a kind of ‘Ark worship’, with the Arks being borne aloft by groups ofpriests and adored by hysterical crowds. Nor was this all: Timkat had beencharacterized by the performance of wild dances and the playing of musicalinstruments before the Arks. This sort of behaviour, it was now clear, had alsobeen an intrinsic part of the Apet festival, right down to the types of musicalinstruments used, which in many cases were identical to those that I had seen inGondar. Of course the flat slabs of the tabotat carried on the heads of theEthiopian priests were rather different in appearance from the Ark-like boatscarried on the shoulders of their long-dead Egyptian counterparts. From myearlier research, however (detailed at some length in Chapter 6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm]), I could hardly forget that according toestablished etymologies the original meaning of tabot had been ‘ship-likecontainer’. Indeed, as I knew very well, the archaic Hebrew word tebah (fromwhich the Ethiopic term had been derived92[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts92]) had been used in the Bible torefer specifically to ship-like arks, namely the ark of Noah and the ark ofbulrushes in which the infant Moses had been cast adrift on the Nile. Nor, I nowrealized, could it possibly be irrelevant that the Kebra Nagast had at one pointdescribed the Ark of the Covenant as ‘the belly of a ship’93[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts93] containing ‘the Two Tables whichwere written by the finger of God.’94[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts94]After catching my breath, I stood up and stepped out from my patch of shade intothe fierce mid-day sunlight that bathed the whole of the colonnade area. I thencontinued my examination of the faded reliefs of the Apet festival which, on thewestern wall, concerned the bringing of the arks from Karnak to the Temple atLuxor (a distance of about three miles) and, on the eastern wall, showed theprocession’s eventual return from Luxor back along the Nile to Karnak againwhere, with all due ceremony, the sacred vessels were reinstalled in theiroriginal resting places. Every detail of these complex and beautifully carvedscenes reminded me irresistibly of Timkat in Gondar – which had also involved anoutgoing procession (bringing the tabotat from the churches to the ‘baptismal’lake beside the old castle) and a returning procession (bringing the tabotatback to their home churches again). Moreover, I could now see clearly that thebizarre ceremonies I had witnessed in the early morning of 19 January at thelake itself had also been prefigured in the Apet festival which, at every stage,appeared to have involved a special reverence for water (indeed, the reliefs ofthe early part of the procession showed that the arks had been carried directlyfrom the temple to the banks of the Nile, where a number of elaborate ritualshad then been performed).SCHOLARLY CORROBORATIONAfter completing my trip to Egypt in April 1990 I took the opportunity to carryout some further research into the evidence that I had stumbled upon there. Idiscovered that the experts had no quarrel with my various conjectures. At onemeeting, for example, Kenneth Kitchen, Professor of Egyptology at LiverpoolUniversity, confirmed that the caskets from Tutankhamen’s tomb that I had seenin the Cairo Museum could indeed have been prototypes for the Ark of theCovenant: ‘At the very least,’ he said in his broad and rather emphaticYorkshire accent, ‘they prove that wooden boxes lined with gold were standardartefacts of the religious furniture of the period and that Moses wouldtherefore have had the technology and skills at his disposal to manufacture theArk. The methods of construction that he would have employed, and the use ofsuch prefabricated structures for religious purposes, are abundantly attested byactual remains, pictures and texts in Egypt over a long period of time.’95[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts95]I also found scholarly corroboration for the link that I believed had existedbetween the festival of Apet and the early Judaic ceremonies surrounding the Arkof the Covenant. Working through piles of reference materials in the BritishLibrary I came across a book published in London in 1884 by the Religious TractSociety and entitled Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments. I might haveignored this slim and unprepossessing volume entirely had I not noticed that itsauthor was a certain A. H. Sayce (who at the time had been Deputy Professor ofPhilology at Oxford University). Remembering that E. A. Wallis Budge, one of thegreat authorities on Egyptian religion, had held Sayce in the highest regard(describing him as a ‘distinguished scholar’96[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts96]) I opened the book at a chapterentitled ‘The Exodus out of Egypt’ and read that, in Sayce’s opinion, ‘the lawand ritual of the Israelites’ had been derived from many sources. Amongst thesewere Various festivals and fasts’ in whichThe gods were carried in procession in ‘ships’, which, as we learn from thesculptures, resembled in form the Hebrew Ark, and were borne on men’s shouldersby means of staves.97 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts97]Encouraged by the support for my speculations that the distinguishednineteenth-century professor had given me, I looked further through thereference works at my disposal and was able to confirm that the ship-like arkscarried during the Apet ceremonials had indeed contained gods, or rather smallstatues of various deities in the Egyptian pantheon.98[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts98] These statues had been made ofstone and thus, it seemed to me, were not far removed in concept from the stone‘Tablets of the Testimony’ that had supposedly been lodged inside the Ark of theCovenant and that the Israelites had regarded as embodying their God. As oneHebrew scholar had put it in a seminal paper published in the 1920s:The tradition of the two sacred stone tablets within the Ark would pointstrongly to the conclusion that the original contents of the Ark must have beena sacred stone … [which] was either conceived of as the deity himself, or as theobject in which the deity was thought to reside permanently.99[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts99]Nor was this the only connection that I was able to establish between the Ark ofthe Covenant and the ship-like arks that had been carried in the Apetceremonies. Those ceremonies, it will be remembered, had taken place in theUpper Egyptian town now known as ‘Luxor’, a relatively recent name derived fromthe Arabic L’ouqsor (meaning ‘the palaces’). Much earlier, during the period ofGreek influence in Egypt (from about the fifth century BC) the whole areaincluding the nearby temple at Karnak had been known as Thebai. Modern Europeanshad subsequently corrupted this name to the more familiar ‘Thebes’.100[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts100] In the process, however, theyhad obscured an intriguing etymology: the word Thebai had in fact been derivedfrom Tapet, the name by which the Luxor/Karnak religious complex had been knownin the era of Tutankhamen and Moses.101[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts101] And Tapet in its turn was merelythe feminine form of Apet – in other words, Luxor and Karnak had originally beennamed after the great festival for which they had been famous,102[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts102] a festival that had centred upona procession in which arks had been carried between the two temples. Whatintrigued me about this, of course, was the phonetic similarity of the wordsTapet and Tabot, a similarity that looked all the less coincidental after I haddiscovered from one learned source that the shape of the Tapet arks had evolvedover the passing centuries, gradually ceasing to resemble ships so closely andbecoming instead ‘more and more like a chest’.103[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts103]As noted above, I had long since established that the Ethiopic term Tabot hadbeen derived from the Hebrew tebah, meaning ‘ship-like container’. Now I beganto wonder whether it was not entirely possible that the word tebah had itselforiginally been derived from the ancient Egyptian Tapet – and whether thisderivation might not have come about because the ceremonies devised for the Arkof the Covenant had been modelled upon those of the Apet festival.104[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts104]Such links and coincidences, though by no means attaining the stature of hardevidence, did deepen my conviction that the Ark of the Covenant could onlyproperly be understood in the context of its Egyptian background. Amongst otherthings, as Professor Kitchen had pointed out, that background demonstrated thatMoses would have had the technology and skills at his disposal to fulfil God’scommand to build an ‘Ark of acacia wood’ and ‘to plate it inside and out withpure gold’.At the same time, however, the sacred relic had been much more than just awooden box lined with gold. I therefore wondered whether an explanation of itsbaleful and destructive powers might also be found in Egypt.Seeking such an explanation I travelled to that country several times and talkedto theologians, biblical scholars and archaeologists. I also surrounded myselfwith rare books, religious texts, folklore, myths and legends and tried todiscern whether threads of fact might not lie entangled amongst the wilderfancies.As my research progressed I became increasingly intrigued by the personality ofMoses, the Hebrew prophet and law-giver who challenged Pharaoh, who led thechildren of Israel to the Promised Land, and who also ordered the constructionof the Ark of the Covenant after he had supposedly received the ‘blueprint’ forits design from God Himself. The more closely I looked at this towering, heroicfigure, the more convinced I became that information of fundamental importanceto my understanding of the Ark would be found within the records of his life.‘A MAGICIAN OF THE HIGHEST ORDER …’It is probably the case that every Christian, Muslim and Jew alive in the worldtoday has a shadowy image of the prophet Moses tucked away in some corner of hisor her mind. Certainly I was no exception to this rule when I began to thinkseriously about him and about his role in the mystery of the Ark. My problem,however, was that I needed to flesh out the caricature that I had acquired inSunday school and, in the process, to gain some real insight into the man whoscholars agree was ‘the outstanding figure in the emergence and formulation ofthe Jewish religion’.105 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts105]Of considerable help to me in completing this task were the extensive and highlyregarded historical writings of Flavius Josephus, a Pharisee who lived inRoman-occupied Jerusalem in the first century AD. In his Antiquities of theJews, compiled from traditions and reference materials unavailable today, thisdiligent scholar chronicled the four hundred years of Hebrew enslavement inEgypt, which lasted roughly from 1650 until 1250 BC, the probable date of theExodus.106 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts106] The birth of Moseswas the key event of this period and was, Josephus said, the subject of aprophecy by an Egyptian ‘sacred scribe’, a person ‘with considerable skill ofaccurately predicting the future’, who informed Pharaoh that there would ariseamongst the Israelitesone who would abase the sovereignty of the Egyptians were he reared to manhood,and would surpass all men in virtue and win everlasting renown. Alarmed thereat,the king, on the sage’s advice, ordered that every male child born to theIsraelites should be destroyed by being cast into the river.107[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts107]On hearing this edict a certain Amram (Moses’s father-to-be) was plunged into‘grievous perplexity’ because ‘his wife was then with child’. God, however,appeared to him in a dream and comforted him with the news that:This child, whose birth has filled the Egyptians with such dread that they havecondemned to destruction all the offspring of the Israelites, shall escape thosewho are watching to destroy him, and, reared in marvellous wise, he shalldeliver the Hebrew race from their bondage in Egypt, and be remembered so longas the universe shall endure, not by Hebrews alone but even by alien nations.108[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts108]These two passages were helpful to me because they considerably expanded thebiblical narrative on the birth of Moses given in the opening chapters of thebook of Exodus. I noted with interest that the great legislator of the Jews hadindeed been remembered ‘even by alien nations’. More intriguing by far, however,was the special emphasis put on the prophecy of the ‘sacred scribe’ who, withhis ability to foretell the future, could only have been an astrologer at thecourt of the Pharaoh. In making this point, Josephus seemed to be hinting that –from the outset – there had been something almost magical about Moses. In thetime-honoured tradition of setting a thief to catch a thief, what we had herewas a magician predicting the coming of a magician.The bare bones of the events that occurred after the child was born are toofamiliar to require lengthy repetition: aged only three months he was placed byhis parents in a papyrus basket coated with bitumen and pitch and cast adrift onthe Nile; downriver Pharaoh’s daughter was bathing; she saw the floating crib,heard cries, and sent her handmaiden to rescue the mewling infant.Subsequently Moses was brought up in the royal household where, according to theBible, he was instructed ‘in all the wisdom of the Egyptians’.109[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts109] Josephus had little to add atthis point, but another classical authority – Philo, the respected Jewishphilosopher who lived around the time of Christ – gave a fairly detailed accountof exactly what Moses was taught: ‘Arithmetic, geometry, the lore of metre,rhythm and harmony were imparted to him by learned Egyptians. These furtherinstructed him in the philosophy conveyed in symbols as displayed in theso-called holy inscriptions.’ Meanwhile ‘inhabitants of neighbouring countries’were assigned to teach him ‘Assyrian letters and the Chaldean science of theheavenly bodies. This he also acquired from the Egyptians, who gave specialattention to astrology.’110 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts110]Reared as an adopted son of the royal family, Moses was seen for a considerableperiod as a successor to the throne.111[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts111] The implication of this specialstatus, I learned, was that in his youth he would have been given a thoroughinitiation into all the most arcane priestly secrets and into the mysteries ofEgyptian magic112 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts112] – a course ofstudy that would have included not only star-knowledge, as indicated by Philo,but also necromancy, divining and other aspects of occult lore.113[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts113]A clue that this may indeed have been so was given in the Bible, where Moses wasdescribed as being ‘mighty in words and deeds’.114[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts114] In the cogent and dependablejudgment of that great scholar and linguist Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, this phrase– also and perhaps not coincidentally applied to Jesus Christ115[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts115] – contained the coded suggestionthat the Hebrew prophet was ‘strong of tongue’, like the Egyptian goddess Isis.What this meant, though Moses was self-confessedly lacking in oratoricaleloquence,116 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts116] was that he musthave been capable of uttering words of power ‘which he knew with correctpronunciation, and halted not in his speech, and was perfect both in giving thecommand and in saying the word.’117[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts117] As such, again like Isis – whowas famous for her proficiency in all kinds of witchcraft – he would have beenequipped to cast the most potent spells. Others around him would therefore havetreated him with a high degree of respect since they would unquestioningly havebelieved him capable of bending reality and overriding the laws of physics byaltering the normal order of things.I was able to turn up a considerable body of evidence from the Old Testament tosupport the contention that Moses had been seen in exactly this way. There was,nevertheless, one important proviso: his magic was depicted throughout as beingwrought solely at the command of Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews.According to the book of Exodus, Moses’s first encounter with Yahweh took placein a wilderness near the land of Midian (to which he had fled to escaperetribution after his anger at the persecution of Hebrew labourers had led himto kill an Egyptian overseer). From the geographical clues that were given, itwas clear that this wilderness must have been located in the southern part ofthe Sinai peninsula, most probably within sight of the peak of Mount Sinaiitself118 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts118] (where Moses was laterto receive the Ten Commandments and the ‘blueprint’ for the Ark). The Bible, atany rate, spoke of ‘the mountain of God’ and placed Moses at its foot when theLord appeared to him ‘in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and helooked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was notconsumed.’119 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts119] God instructedMoses that he should return to Egypt in order to lead his people out of theirbondage there.120 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts120] Beforeagreeing, however, the prophet asked the name of the strange and powerful beingwho had addressed him.121 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts121]This daring question in itself contained evidence of Moses’s identity as asorcerer for, as the great anthropologist Sir James Frazer observed in hisseminal work The Golden Bough:Every Egyptian magician … believed that he who possessed the true name possessedthe very being of god or man, and could force even a deity to obey him as aslave obeys his master. Thus the art of the magician consisted in obtaining fromthe gods a revelation of their sacred names, and he left no stone unturned toaccomplish his end.122 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts122]The Lord, however, did not respond directly to the prophet’s question. Insteadhe replied briefly and enigmatically with these words: ‘I AM WHO I AM.’ By wayof further clarification he then added: ‘I am the God of thy father, the God ofAbraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.’123[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts123]The phrase ‘I am who I am’ (or ‘I am what I am’, ‘I am that I am’, depending onthe translation) was, I discovered, the root meaning of the name Yahweh used inthe Old Testament – and subsequently bastardized in the Authorized King JamesVersion of the Bible as ‘Jehovah’. This name, however, was no name; rather itwas an evasive formula based loosely on the Hebrew verb ‘to be’ and written asfour consonants which transliterated into the Latin alphabet as ‘YHWH’. Known totheologians as the tetragrammaton, these letters revealed nothing beyond theactive existence of God and thus continued to conceal the divine identity frommodern researchers every bit as effectively as they had once done from Moses.Indeed so potent was their mystery that no one today could even claim to knowexactly how they should be pronounced; rendering the tetragrammaton as ‘Yahweh’by the insertion of the vowels ‘a’ and ‘e’ was, however, the acceptedconvention.124 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts124]The importance of all this from the biblical perspective was that the deityknew, and pronounced, the name of Moses; Moses, by contrast, only managed toobtain from Him the ritual incantation ‘I am who I am’. Henceforward, therefore,the prophet was bound to answer to God and to do his bidding; likewise all hissorcery in the future would derive from the power of God, and from the power ofGod alone.It was understandable that the later redactors of the Scriptures should havewanted to present the relationship between omnipotent God and fallible man inprecisely this way. What they could not do, however, was erase the evidence thatthat man had indeed been a sorcerer; neither could they cover up the mostconvincing demonstrations of his sorcery – the plagues and pestilences that hewas soon to inflict upon the Egyptians in order to force Pharaoh to release thechildren of Israel from captivity.In working these terrible miracles Moses was assisted by his older half-brotherAaron, who frequently served as his agent and spokesman. Both Moses and Aaronwere also equipped with rods – effectively magicians’ wands – which they used towork their spells. That of Moses was sometimes referred to as ‘the rod ofGod’125 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts125] and first appeared whenthe prophet complained to Yahweh that neither Pharaoh, nor the children ofIsrael, would believe that he had been divinely commissioned, unless he was ableto provide some kind of proof. ‘What is that in thine hand?’ God asked. ‘A rod,’Moses replied.126 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts126] God then toldhim to throw it on the ground ‘that they may believe that the Lord God hathappeared unto thee’:And he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from beforeit. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand and take it by the tail.And he put forth his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand.127[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts127]Once again the emphasis put by the scriptural text on the primacy of God’s rolein all of this was understandable. Once again also, however, the connectionswith Egyptian occult practice were quite unmissable. The turning of an inanimatestick into a snake, and then back again into a stick, was a feat frequentlycarried out by the magicians of that country; likewise the power to control themovements of venomous reptiles was claimed by Egyptian priests from the veryearliest times; last but not least, all Egyptian magicians – amongst them thesage Abaaner and the sorceror-king Nectanebus – possessed marvellous rods madeof ebony.128 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts128]Looked at in this light, I did not find it surprising that the first contestsbetween Moses and Aaron on one side, and the priests at Pharaoh’s court on theother, were fairly evenly drawn. To impress the Egyptian tyrant, Aaron threwdown his rod – which, of course, became a serpent as soon as it hit the ground.Undaunted Pharaoh called for his own sages and sorcerers, ‘and with theirwitchcraft the magicians of Egypt did the same. Each threw his staff down andthese turned into serpents.’ Then, however, Aaron’s rod – imbued with thesuperior power of Yahweh – swallowed up the rods of the magicians.129[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts129]In the next encounter Moses and Aaron turned the waters of the Nile to blood.Remarkable though this trick was, Pharaoh remained unimpressed because ‘themagicians of Egypt used their witchcraft to do the same.’130[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts130]The plague of frogs, which followed, was likewise matched by Pharaoh’ssorcerers.131 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts131] But the plague ofmosquitoes (gnats in some translations, lice in others) was too much for them:‘The magicians with their witchcraft tried to produce mosquitoes and failed. Themosquitoes attacked men and beasts. So the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This isthe finger of God.” ’132 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts132]Still the hard-hearted king refused to let the Hebrews go. He was punished forthis with a plague of flies133 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts133]and soon afterwards with a pestilence that killed livestock.134[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts134] Moses next caused a plague ofboils to break out (he did this by throwing a handful of soot into the air135[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts135]) and then, by using his rod, heprocured thunder and hail, a plague of locusts and three days of ‘thickdarkness’.136 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts136] Finally, theHebrew prophet arranged for the death of ‘all the first-born of the land ofEgypt: the first-born of Pharaoh, the first-born of the prisoner in his dungeon,and the first-born of all the cattle.’137[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts137] After this: ‘The Egyptians urgedthe people to hurry up and leave the land because, they said, “Otherwise weshall all be dead”.’138 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts138]So the Exodus began, and with it a prolonged period of danger and enchantmentduring which, at the foot of Mount Sinai, the Ark of the Covenant was built.Before reaching Sinai, however, the Red Sea had to be crossed. Here Moses gaveanother dramatic demonstration of his prowess in the occult arts:And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to goback by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and thewaters were divided. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the seaupon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right handand on their left.139 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts139]As everyone who has ever attended Sunday school will remember, the pursuingEgyptian forces followed the Israelites into ‘the midst of the sea, even allPharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his horsemen.’140[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts140] Then:Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea – and the waters returned, andcovered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that cameinto the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. But thechildren of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waterswere a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.141[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts141]Again, and predictably, the Bible put emphasis on the power of God: Moses mayhave stretched out his hand a couple of times but it was the Lord who ‘causedthe waters to go back’ – and to ‘return’. I found it slightly harder to acceptthe scriptural party-line on this, however, after I had learned that the abilityto command the waters of seas and lakes had also frequently been claimed byEgyptian priests and magicians. For example, one of the ancient documents that Istudied (the Westcar Papyrus) related a story from the early Fourth Dynasty –some 1,500 years before the time of Moses – which focussed on the doings of acertain Tchatcha-em-ankh, a Kher Heb or High Priest attached to the court ofPharaoh Seneferu. Apparently the Pharaoh was out boating one day in the pleasantcompany of ‘twenty young virgins having beautiful heads of hair and lovely formsand shapely limbs.’ One of these ladies dropped a much- favoured ornament ofhers into the lake and was broken-hearted to have lost it. The Pharaoh, however,summoned Tchatcha-em- ankh whospake certain words of power (hekau) and having thus caused one section of thewater of the lake to go upon the other, he found the ornament lying upon apot-sherd, and he took it and gave it to the maiden. Now the water was twelvecubits deep, but when Tchatcha-em-ankh had lifted up one section of the wateronto the other, that portion became four and twenty cubits deep. The magicianagain uttered certain words of power, and the water of the lake became as it hadbeen before he had caused one portion of it to go up onto the other.142[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts142]While of course to do with a much more trivial incident, the story in theWestcar Papyrus nevertheless contained many points that I could only regard asstartlingly similar to the parting of the waters of the Red Sea. This, in myview, left no room for doubt that Moses’s virtuoso performance in bringing aboutthe great miracle established him firmly in an ancient, and very Egyptian,occult tradition. Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, who I had first encountered throughhis translation of the Kebra Nagast, but who had also been keeper of Egyptianand Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum, had this to say on the subject:Moses was a skilled performer of magical rituals and was deeply learned in theknowledge of the accompanying spells, incantations, and magical formulas ofevery description … [Moreover] the miracles which he wrought … suggest that hewas not only a priest, but a magician of the highest order and perhaps even aKher Heb.143 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts143]SECRET SCIENCE?As a Kher Heb (High Priest) of the Egyptian temple Moses would undoubtedly havehad access to a substantial corpus of esoteric wisdom and of magico-religious‘science’ that the priestly guilds kept secret from the laity. I knew thatmodern Egyptologists accepted that such a body of knowledge had existed.144[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts144] I also knew that they had verylittle idea as to what it might actually have consisted of: obscure referencesto it appeared in inscriptions in the tombs of senior temple officials butalmost nothing of any substance had survived in written form. A great deal wasprobably passed on in an exclusively oral tradition confined to initiates.145[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts145] Scholarly opinion had it,however, that most of the rest had been destroyed, either deliberately oraccidentally. Who could possibly guess what treasures of learning were lost whenfire ravaged the great library at Alexandria – a library that was reputed, bythe second century BC, to have contained more than 200,000 scrolls?146[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts146]There was, however, one matter on which there was no need to speculate: asHerodotus put it in the fifth century BC, ‘Egypt has more wonders in it than anycountry in the world and more works that are beyond description than anywhereelse.’ Amongst other achievements, this widely travelled Greek historian – whosebooks are still in print – rightly credited the Egyptians with being ‘the firstof mankind to invent the year and to make twelve divisions of the seasons forit’. Herodotus also claimed to have penetrated some of the mysteries of theEgyptian priesthood, but then, rather tantalizingly, added that he could not –or would not – reveal what he had learned.147[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts147]Herodotus was not the first or the last visitor to Egypt to come away with thedistinct impression that there were hidden secrets there – and that there mightbe more to these secrets than mere religious mumbo-jumbo. Indeed the notion thatthis ancient culture originally promoted itself to greatness through theapplication of some kind of advanced, but now lost, scientific knowledge was, Idiscovered, one of the most durable and pervasive in human history: it hadproved equally attractive to furious cranks and sober scholars and had been thesubject of immense amounts of controversy, acrimony, wild speculation andserious research.It was a notion, furthermore, that impinged directly upon my quest because itraised an intriguing possibility: as a magician skilled in Egyptian ‘sacredscience’, might not Moses have had at his disposal far more in the way ofknowledge and technology than had hitherto been recognized by thearchaeologists? And might he not have applied this knowledge and technology tothe construction of the Ark of the Covenant?Such a hypothesis seemed worthy of further investigation. I quickly discovered,however, that what was known about the technological achievements of the ancientEgyptians raised at least as many questions as it answered.It was clear, for example, that these people were clever metalworkers: theirgold jewellery, in particular, was quite exquisite, showing a degree ofcraftsmanship rarely equalled since. It was also notable, from the very earliesttimes, that the edges of their copper tools were brought to a remarkable degreeof hardness – so hard, in fact, that they could cut through schist and thetoughest limestone. No modern blacksmith, I learned, would have been able toachieve such results with copper; it was thought likely, however, that any ‘lostart’ lay less in the manufacture of the tools than in the manner in which theywere manipulated on site by the stonemasons.148[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts148]A study of many surviving hieroglyphs and papyri left me in no doubt that theancient Egyptians were – at the very least – moderate mathematicians in themodern sense. They employed unit fractions and appeared to have developed aspecial form of infinitesimal calculus which enabled them to compute the volumeof complex objects.149 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts149] It alsoseemed highly probable, more than 2,000 years before the Greeks, that they hadunderstood how to use the transcendental number pi to derive the circumferenceof any circle from its diameter.150[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts150]Egyptian observational astronomy was another area in which great progressappeared to have been made at a very early date. According to Livio Stecchini,an American professor of the history of science and an expert on ancientmeasurement, astronomical techniques in use as early as 2200 BC had enabledEgyptian priests to calculate the length of a degree of latitude and longitudeto within a few hundred feet – an achievement that was not to be equalled byother civilizations for almost 4,000 years.151[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts151]The Egyptians also excelled in medicine: their surgeons were skilled in avariety of difficult procedures,152[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts152] their understanding of the humannervous system was refined, and their pharmacopoeia included several well knowndrugs in their first-recorded applications.153[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts153]I came across many further pieces of evidence which illustrated the relativelyadvanced state of Egyptian knowledge at a time when the European peoples werestill plunged in barbarism. In my view, however, none of the data suggested theexistence of any science that we would regard as truly breathtaking today, norof any branch of technical achievement sufficiently sophisticated to account forthe potent energies that the Ark of the Covenant had been able to unleash.Nevertheless, as I have already noted, the belief that the Egyptians were theguardians of some ‘great and secret wisdom’ was widespread and almost immune tocounter-argument.I knew very well that such ardent conviction often stemmed more from asubconscious desire to glorify the past of the human species than from anyrational weighing up of empirical facts. This, certainly, was the dominantopinion of members of the archaeological establishment, most of whom regardedthe ‘great and secret wisdom’ theory as balderdash and claimed to have foundnothing extraordinary in Egypt in more than a century of painstaking digging andsifting. I myself am sceptical and pragmatic by nature. Nevertheless I mustconfess that the physical evidence which I saw everywhere around me during theseries of research trips that I made to this beautiful and time-worn landconvinced me that the academics did not have all the answers, that much remainedto be explained, and that there were a number of aspects of the Egyptianexperience which had been lamentably under-researched simply because they werebeyond the scope of conventional archaeology – and probably of all otheraccepted forms of scholarly investigation as well.Three sites had a particularly profound impact on me: the temple complex atKarnak; the Zoser ‘step’ pyramid at Saqqara; and the Great Pyramid at Giza onthe outskirts of Cairo. It seemed to me that the special composite quality ofraw power, delicate grace, imposing grandeur, mystery and immortality that theseedifices possessed stemmed from the working out within them of a refined andhighly developed understanding of harmony and proportion – an understanding thatcould reasonably be said to have amounted to a science. Combining engineering,architecture and design, that science had been remarkable by any standards. Ithad never since been surpassed in its ability to stimulate religious awe, and ithad been equalled in Europe only in the great Gothic cathedrals of the MiddleAges such as Chartres.Was this an accident? Was the essentially similar effect on the senses of theEgyptian monuments and the Gothic cathedrals a matter of pure chance – or wasthere perhaps a connection?I had long suspected that there had indeed been a connection and that theKnights Templar, through their discoveries during the Crusades, might haveformed the missing link in the chain of transmission of secret architecturalknowledge.154 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts154] At Karnak, as Iwalked slowly past the looming pylons, into the Great Court, and through theforest of giant columns of the Hypostyle Hall, I could not help but rememberthat Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, the Templars’ patron, had defined God –astonishingly for a Christian – as ‘length, width, height and depth’.155[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts155] Nor could I forget that theTemplars themselves had been great builders and great architects, or that theCistercian monastic order to which Saint Bernard had belonged had also excelledin this particular field of human endeavour.156[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts156]Centuries and civilizations before them, however, it had been the ancientEgyptians who had been the first masters of the science of building – the firstand still the greatest architectmasons that the world had ever known. Moreover,the monuments that they left behind beggared description and challenged timeitself. Typical in this respect were two tall obelisks that dominated the Karnakcomplex and that I found myself particularly drawn to on my own visits there.One, I discovered, had been erected by Pharaoh Tuthmosis I (1504–1492 BC) andthe other by Queen Hatshepsut (1473–1458 BC).157[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts157] Both were perfect monoliths,hewn from single slabs of solid pink granite, the former standing 70 feet inheight and weighing an estimated 143 tons, the latter standing 97 feet in heightand weighing an estimated 320 tons.158[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts158] A few minutes’ walk to thesouth, overlooking a sacred lake that was used by the temple priests forelaborate purification ceremonies, I found a third, but tumbled and broken,obelisk, the top 30 feet of which – surmounted by a finely pointed pyramidion –were nevertheless quite undamaged. On one occasion, following the advice of aguidebook I had with me,159 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts159] Istepped over the rope perimeter surrounding this fallen giant and placed my earto the angle of the pyramidion. I then struck the granite firmly with the palmof my hand and listened, entranced, as the entire monolith reverberated with adeep, low-pitched tone like some strange and prodigious musical instrument.It seemed to me that this phenomenon could not possibly have been accidental. Onthe contrary, the enormous care and skill required to produce such a monolith(when the same splendid visual effect might have been achieved simply bycementing block on block) only really made sense if the ancient Egyptians hadwanted to realize some special property inherent in a single piece of stone.Something, at any rate, other than mere aesthetic considerations must have lainbehind the erection of these elegant and flawless stelae. I learned that theyhad not been hewn locally but rather had been transported by river from granitequarries more than 200 kilometres to the south.The Nile was a highway broad and deep. It was therefore reasonable to suppose,once the obelisks had been loaded upon barges, that it would not have been sodifficult a matter to float them downstream. What I found much harder tounderstand, however, was the method that the ancient Egyptians had employed toget these massive needles of stone on to the barges in the first place – andthen off them again once they had arrived at their destination. One monolith hadbeen left in situ at the quarries, only partially separated from the bedrock,because it cracked before it was completely excavated. Had this accident notbefallen it, however, it would have made an obelisk 137 feet high and almost 14feet thick at its base. Obviously, when the work was started, it had beenconfidently intended that this monstrous object – weighing a staggering 1,168tons160 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts160] – would be moved anderected somewhere. Yet it was extremely difficult to explain exactly how thatwould have been done by a people who (according to the archaeologists) lackedeven simple winches and pulley systems.161[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts161] Indeed I knew that the task ofmoving so large a piece of solid stone over a distance of several hundred feet –never mind several hundred kilometres! – would have taxed to the limit theingenuity of a modern team of construction engineers supported by the mostsophisticated and powerful machinery.Equally puzzling, once the monoliths reached Karnak, was the manner in whichthey had been set upright on their pedestals with such faultless accuracy. Inone of the temples a relief depicted Pharaoh raising an obelisk with noassistance of any kind and making use of just a single piece of rope.162[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts162] It was quite normal for theruler to be portrayed in heroic poses and perhaps all that was intended here wasa symbolic representation of a real process in which hundreds of labourers weretrained to pull together on multiple ropes. However, I could not rid myself ofthe suspicion that there must have been more to it than this. According to JohnAnthony West, an experienced Egyptologist, the Pharaohs and priests werepreoccupied with a principle known as Ma’at – often translated as ‘equilibrium’or ‘balance’. It was possible, he suggested, that this principle might have beencarried over into practical spheres and ‘that the Egyptians understood and usedtechniques of mechanical balance unknown to us’. Such techniques would haveenabled them to ‘manipulate these immense stones with ease and finesse … Whatwould be magic to us was method to them.’163[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts163]If the obelisks, at times, seemed like the products of almost superhuman skill,I had to admit that the Pyramids in all ways surpassed them. As Jean FranqoisChampollion, the founder of modern Egyptology, once remarked, ‘the Egyptians ofold thought like men a hundred feet tall. We in Europe are but Lilliputians.’164[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts164]Certainly, when I first entered the Great Pyramid at Giza, I felt like aLilliputian – dwarfed and slightly intimidated, not only by the sheer mass andsize of this mountain of stone but also by an almost tangible sense of theaccumulated weight of the ages.On previous visits I had only seen the exterior of the pyramid, since I had feltno desire to join the swarms of tourists pouring inside. Early in the morning of27 April 1990, however, I managed by means of a small bribe to get into thegreat structure completely on my own. In the dim light provided by a series oflow-wattage bulbs, and bent over almost double to avoid hitting my head on therock face above, I climbed the 129 feet of the ascending passage, and then the157 feet of the more spacious Grand Gallery, until I reached the so-called‘King’s Chamber’ – a 2:1 rectangle, the floor of which measured 34 feet 4 inchesby 17 feet 2 inches. Just over 19 feet high, the ceiling of this room – whichoccupied the very heart of the pyramid – consisted of nine monolithic blocks ofgranite each weighing approximately 50 tons.165[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts165]I do not remember how long I remained in the chamber. The atmosphere was musty,and the air warm – like the exhalation of some giant beast. The silence thatsurrounded me seemed absolute, all-enveloping, and dense. At some point, for areason that I cannot explain, I moved to the middle of the floor and gave voiceto a sustained low-pitched tone like the song of the fallen obelisk at Karnak.The walls and the ceiling seemed to collect this sound, to gather and amplify it– and then to project it back at me so that I could sense the returningvibrations through my feet and scalp and skin. I felt electrified and energized,excited and at the same time calm, as though I stood on the brink of sometremendous and absolutely inevitable revelation.After my April 1990 visit I was so impressed by the Great Pyramid that I spentseveral weeks researching its history. I discovered that it had been builtaround 2550 BC for Kufu (or Cheops), the second Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty,and that it was also the single largest edifice ever constructed by man.166[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts166] The conventional belief amongstarchaeologists was that it had been designed purely and simply as a tomb. Thisconjecture, however, struck me as being utterly incomprehensible: no mummy ofany Pharaoh had ever been found there, only a poor and undecorated sarcophagusin the so-called King’s Chamber (a sarcophagus, by the way, that was lidless andcompletely empty when it was first brought to light by Caliph Al-Mamun, an Arabruler of Egypt who broke in with a party of diggers in the ninth century AD.167[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts167])As I researched the subject further it became clear to me that the real purposeof the Great Pyramid was, in fact, a matter of considerable debate. On one sidestood the most orthodox and prosaic scholars insisting that it was nothing morethan a mausoleum. On the other side stood the pyramidologists – an apocalyptictribe who pretended to find all manner of prophecies and signs in virtuallyevery dimension of the immense structure.The lunacies of this latter group were perhaps best summarized by one US criticwho pointed out that it is possible to marshal numbers to prove almost anything:‘If a suitable unit of measurement is used, an exact equivalent to the distanceto Timbuktu is certain to be found in the number of street lamps in Bond Street,or the specific gravity of mud, or the mean weight of adult goldfish.’168[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts168]This, of course, was quite true. Nevertheless, I could see that there werecertain surprising features to which the pyramidologists persistently drewattention which did seem unlikely to be accidental. For example, it was a factthat the latitude and longitude lines that intersected at the Great Pyramid (30degrees north and 31 degrees east) crossed more dry land than any others. Thisput the edifice at the very centre of the habitable world.169[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts169] Likewise, it was a fact thatwhen a north-facing quadrant (a cake-slice-shaped quarter circle) was drawn on amap with its axis at the pyramid then this quadrant exactly encapsulated theentire Nile Delta.170 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts170] Finally,it was a fact that all the pyramids at Giza were precisely aligned to thecardinal points – north, south, east and west.171[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts171] It was, I thought, extremelydifficult to explain how this particular feat of surveying could have beenachieved so long before the supposed date of the invention of the compass.What intrigued me most of all about the Great Pyramid, however, was simply itssheer size and scope. Occupying a ground area of 13.1 acres, I ascertained thatthe core masonry of the structure was composed of no less than 2.3 millionblocks of limestone each weighing approximately 2.5 tonnes.172[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts172] Herodotus, whose informant wasan Egyptian priest, claimed that gangs of 100,000 labourers built the edifice in20 years (working only during the three-month agricultural lay-off season), andthat the construction technique involved ‘levers made of short timbers’ whichwere used to lift the massive blocks from ground level.173[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts173] No researcher subsequently hadbeen able to guess at exactly what these ‘levers’ might have been or how theycould have been used. However, after taking account of the time required for allthe site-clearing, quarrying, levelling and other works that would have had tobe done, civil engineer P. Garde-Hanson of the Danish Engineering Institutecalculated that 4,000 blocks would have had to be installed each day, at therate of 6.67 blocks per minute, if the job were indeed to have been completedwithin 20 years. ‘Generally speaking,’ he concluded, ‘I believe it would demandthe combined genius of a Cyrus, an Alexander the Great, and a Julius Caesar,with a Napoleon and Wellington thrown in for good measure, to organize thearmies required for carrying out the work as assumed.’174[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts174]I then learned that a team of Japanese engineers had recently tried to build a35-feet-high replica of the Great Pyramid (rather smaller than the original,which was 481 feet 5 inches in height). The team started off by limiting itselfstrictly to techniques proved by archaeology to have been in use during theFourth Dynasty. However, construction of the replica under these limitationsturned out to be impossible and, in due course, modern earth-moving, quarryingand lifting machines were brought to the site. Still no worthwhile progress wasmade. Ultimately, with some embarrassment, the project had to be abandoned.175[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts175]All in all, therefore, the Great Pyramid – with its many riddles and mysteries –suggested to me that the ancient Egyptians must have been much more than‘technically accomplished primitives’ (as they had often been described), andthat there must have existed amongst them a special kind of scientificknowledge. If so then it was entirely possible that the baleful powers of theArk of the Covenant could have been the products of that science – in whichMoses would most certainly have been a leading practitioner.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_047_r1.jpg]48 The construction of the Ark of the Covenant at the foot of Mount Sinai.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_048_r1.jpg]49 Glowing with fire and light the Ark is transported through the wildernesswrapped in thick cloths to protect its bearers from its unearthly powers.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_049_r1.jpg]50 The Ark at the destruction of Jericho.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_049a_r1.jpg]51 King Uzziah smitten with leprosy after approaching the Ark (see ChapterFifteen [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c15_r1.htm], ‘Hidden History’, this page[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c15_r1.htm#page413]).[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_050_r1.jpg]52 Nadab and Abihu, two of the sons of Aaron, are struck dead as they approachthe Ark.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_051_r1.jpg]53 After receiving the tablets of stone, which he later placed inside the Ark,Moses’ face was burnt and shone so terribly that ever afterwards he had to weara veil.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_052_r1.jpg]54 The Temple complex at Karnak, Egypt.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_053_r1.jpg]55 Archaeologists at work on the site of the Jewish Temple on the island ofElphantine, upper Egypt.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_054_r1.jpg]56 and 57.

Tutankhamen reigned in Egyptapproximately 100 years before Moses led the Exodus. It is therefore probablethat the Hebrew prophet devised the Ark according to an Egyptian prototype ofprecisely the kind found in Tutankhamen’s tomb.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_055_r1.jpg][images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_056_r1.jpg]58 Priests and deacons at prayer, Timkat, Axum.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_057_r1.jpg]59 Timkat procession, Axum.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_058_r1.jpg]60 The sanctuary of the Ark of the Covenant at Axum.[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_059_r1.jpg]61 Gebra Mikail, the Guardian of the Ark."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13TREASURES OF DARKNESSMy research had convinced me of the possibility that the ancient Egyptians mighthave possessed some advanced but secret scientific knowledge which Moses couldhave applied to the design of the Ark of the Covenant.But where could such a body of knowledge have come from? Ancient Egypt itself,as I was very well aware, provided a simple – though supernatural – answer tothis question. Every relevant surviving record that I had studied claimedunambiguously that it had been given to mankind by the moon-god Thoth, the lordand multiplier of time, the celestial scribe and invigilator of individualdestinies, the inventor of writing and of all wisdom, and the patron of magic.1[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts1]Frequently represented on temple and tomb walls as an ibis, or as an ibis-headedman, and more rarely as a baboon, Thoth was venerated throughout Egypt as a truelunar deity who in some manifestations was identical with the moon itself and inothers was the guardian of the moon, charged with ensuring that it kept to itscourse across the night skies, waxing and waning, vanishing and reappearing,precisely as and when it should. It was in this capacity – as the divineregulative force responsible for all heavenly calculations and annotations –that Thoth measured time, dividing it into months (to the first of which he gavehis own name).2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts2]His powers, however, were believed to have extended far beyond the merecalibration of the seasons. According to the pervasive and influential teachingsof the priestly guild established at the sacred city of Hermopolis in UpperEgypt, Thoth was the universal demiurge who created the world through the soundof his voice alone, bringing it into being with the utterance of a single wordof power.3 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts3]Regarded by the Egyptians as a deity who understood the mysteries of ‘all thatis hidden under the heavenly vault’, Thoth was also believed to have had theability to bestow wisdom on certain specially selected individuals. It was saidthat he had inscribed the rudiments of his secret knowledge on 36,535 scrollsand then hidden these scrolls about the earth intending that they should besought for by future generations but found ‘only by the worthy’ – who were touse their discoveries for the benefit of mankind.4[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts4]Later identified by the Greeks with their own god Hermes, Thoth in fact stood atthe very centre of an enormous body of Egyptian traditions stretching back intothe most distant and impenetrable past. No scholar, I learned, could honestlysay how old this moon-god really was, or even make a guess at where and when hiscult began. At the dawn of civilization in Egypt, Thoth was there. Furthermore,throughout the entire 3,000 or more years of the dynastic period, he wascontinuously revered for certain very specific qualities that he was said topossess and for his supposed contributions to human welfare. He was, forexample, credited with being the inventor of drawing, of hieroglyphic writingand of all the sciences – specifically architecture, arithmetic, surveying,geometry, astronomy, medicine and surgery. He was also seen as the most powerfulof sorcerers, endowed with nothing less than complete knowledge and wisdom. Hewas exalted as the author of the great and terrible book of magic that wasregarded by the priests at Hermopolis as the source of their understanding ofthe occult. Moreover whole chapters of the famous Book of the Dead wereattributed to him, as well as almost the entire corpus of closely guarded sacredliterature. He was believed, in short, to possess a virtual monopoly on esotericlearning and was therefore called ‘the mysterious’ and ‘the unknown’.5[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts5]The ancient Egyptians were quite convinced that their first rulers were gods.Not surprisingly, Thoth was one of these divine kings: his reign on earth –during which he passed on to mankind his greatest and most beneficial inventions– was said to have lasted 3,226 years.6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts6] Before him the Egyptians believedthat they had been ruled by another deity – Osiris, who was also closelyassociated with the moon (and with the numbers seven, fourteen and twenty-eightwhich relate to physical lunar cycles7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts7]). Although Osiris and Thoth lookedquite different from one another in some of their manifestations, I was able toestablish that they were similar or related in others (in certain archaic textsthey were described as brothers8 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts8]).A number of papyri and inscriptions went even further and portrayed them asbeing effectively the same entity, or at least as performing the same functions.They were most commonly associated in the celestial Judgment Hall where thesouls of the dead came to be weighed in the Great Scales. Here Osiris – as judgeand final arbiter – often seemed to be the superior of the two gods, while Thothwas a mere scribe who recorded the verdict. Many of the tableaux from the Bookof the Dead, however, reversed this relationship, as did a large vignette of theJudgment Scene found amongst the Theban funerary papyri of the New Kingdom. Thislatter document portrayed Osiris sitting passively to one side while Thothdetermined the verdict, and then recorded and pronounced it.9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts9] In other words, not only wereThoth and Osiris both gods of the moon, gods of the dead (and perhaps brothers);both were also judges and law-makers.As my research continued I noted such similarities with interest, but failed, atfirst, to see their relevance to my own quest for the Ark of the Covenant. Thenit occurred to me that there was one invariable link between the two deitieswhich also tied them conceptually to Moses and to all his works: like him theywere above all else civilizing heroes who bestowed the benefits of religion,law, social order and prosperity upon their followers.Thoth, it will be remembered, invented writing and science and brought these andmany other wonders of enlightenment into the world in order to improve the lotof the Egyptian people. Likewise, Osiris was universally believed to have playeda crucial role in the evolution and development of Egyptian society. When hebegan his rule on earth as divine monarch the country was barbaric, rude anduncultured and the Egyptians themselves were cannibals. When he ascended toHeaven, however, he left behind an advanced and sophisticated nation. His manycontributions included teaching his people to cultivate the soil, to plant grainand barley, to grow vines, to worship the gods, and to abandon their previouslysavage customs. He also provided them with a code of laws.10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts10]Such stories, of course, could have been fabrications. In a speculative frame ofmind, however, I found myself wondering whether there might not after all havebeen something more than pure fancy and legend behind the tradition that Egyptbecame a great nation because of the gifts of Thoth and Osiris. Was it not justpossible, I conjectured, that the all-wise, all-knowing moon-god could have beena mythical version of the truth – a metaphor for some real individual or groupof individuals who, in remotest antiquity, brought the benefits of civilizationand science to a primitive land?THE CIVILIZERSI might have dismissed this notion out of hand had I not learned shortlyafterwards of the existence of a great mystery – a mystery to which nodefinitive solution had ever been proposed. Rather than developing slowly andpainfully, as might have been expected, it seemed that the civilization of Egypthad emerged all at once and fully formed. Indeed, by all accounts, the period oftransition from primitive to advanced society had been so short that it reallymade no kind of historical sense. Technological skills that should have takenhundreds or even thousands of years to evolve had appeared almost literallyovernight, and apparently with no antecedents whatsoever.For example, remains from the pre-dynastic period dated to around 3600 BC showedno trace of writing. Then, quite suddenly and inexplicably, the hieroglyphsfamiliar from so many of the ruins of ancient Egypt began to appear and to doso, furthermore, in a complete and perfect state. Far from being mere picturesof objects or actions, this written language was complex and structured, withsigns that represented sounds only and with a detailed system of numericalsymbols. Even the very earliest hieroglyphs were already stylized andconventionalized; it was also clear that an advanced cursive script had comeinto common usage by the dawn of the First Dynasty.11[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts11]What struck me as remarkable about all this was that there were absolutely notraces of evolution from simple to more sophisticated styles. The same was trueof mathematics, medicine, astronomy and architecture, and also of Egypt’samazingly rich and convoluted religio-mythological system (even such refinedworks as the Book of the Dead existed right at the start of the dynasticperiod.12 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts12])Unfortunately, there is not space here to present all or even a tiny part of thedata which confirms the sheer suddenness with which Egyptian civilizationemerged. By way of summary, however, I will quote the authoritative opinion ofProfessor Walter Emery, late Edwards Professor of Egyptology at the Universityof London:At a period approximately 3,400 years before Christ, a great change took placein Egypt, and the country passed rapidly from a state of neolithic culture witha complex tribal character to [one of] well-organized monarchy …At the same time the art of writing appears, monumental architecture and thearts and crafts develop to an astonishing degree, and all the evidence points tothe existence of a luxurious civilization. All this was achieved within acomparatively short period of time, for there appears to be little or nobackground to these fundamental developments in writing and architecture.13[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts13]One explanation, I realized, could simply have been that Egypt had received itssudden and tremendous cultural boost from some other known civilization of theancient world – Sumer, on the Lower Euphrates in Mesopotamia, being the mostlikely contender. Moreover, despite many basic differences, I was able toestablish that a variety of shared building and architectural styles14[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts14] did suggest a link between thetwo regions. None of these similarities, however, turned out be strong enough toallow me to infer that the connection had been in any way causal, with onesociety directly influencing the other. On the contrary, as Professor Emery putit:The impression we get is of an indirect connection, and perhaps the existence ofa third party, whose influence spread to both the Euphrates and theNile … Modern scholars have tended to ignore the possibility of immigration toboth regions from some hypothetical and as yet undiscovered area. [However], athird party whose cultural achievements were passed on independently to Egyptand Mesopotamia would best explain the common features and fundamentaldifferences between the two civilizations.15[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts15]This theory, I felt, shed revealing light on the otherwise mysterious fact thatthe Egyptians and the Sumerian people of Mesopotamia worshipped virtuallyidentical lunar deities who were amongst the very oldest in their respectivepantheons.16 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts16] Exactly like Thoth,the Sumerian moon-god Sin was charged with measuring the passage of time (‘Atthe month’s beginning to shine on earth, thou shalt show two horns to mark sixdays. On the seventh day divide the crown in two. On the fourteenth day, turnthy full face.’17 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts17]) Like Thoth,too, Sin was regarded as being all-knowing and all-wise. At the end of everymonth the other gods of the Sumerian pantheon came to consult him and he madedecisions for them.18 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts18] Neither wasI alone in my intuition that something more than mere chance might haveunderpinned these links between Sin and Thoth. According to the eminentEgyptologist Sir E. A. Wallis Budge:The similarity between the two … gods is too close to be accidental … It wouldbe wrong to say that the Egyptians borrowed from the Sumerians or the Sumeriansfrom the Egyptians, but it may be submitted that the literati of both peoplesborrowed their theological systems from some common but exceedingly ancientsource.19 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts19]The question, therefore, was this: what was that ‘common but exceedingly ancientsource’, that ‘hypothetical and as yet undiscovered area’, that advanced ‘thirdparty’ to which both Budge and Emery referred? Having stuck their necks out along way already, I was frustrated to find that neither authority was preparedto speculate much further. Emery, however, did hint at where he thought thecradle of Egyptian civilization might have been located: ‘Vast tracts of theMiddle East and the Red Sea and East African coasts’, he rather coyly observedin this context, ‘remain unexplored by the archaeologist.’20[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts20]I was sure that if Egypt had indeed received the gifts of civilization andscience from elsewhere then some record of this momentous transaction would havebeen preserved. The deification of two great civilizers –Thoth and Osiris – wasevidence of a kind: although presented as theology, the legends of these godssounded to my ears much more like the echoes of long-forgotten events which hadactually taken place.21 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts21] But Ifelt I needed something more substantial – something which clearly andindisputably attested to beneficial contacts with an advanced donor society andwhich also explained how that society had managed to disappear without a trace.I did find such an account. It was the familiar story of the lost continent ofAtlantis – a story that, in recent years, had been so thoroughly degraded byoutlandish speculations that it had become a form of professional suicide forany scholar even to appear to take it seriously (let alone to research itproperly). After peeling away all the New Age nonsense, however, I was struck bya single significant fact: the earliest-surviving report of Atlantis had comefrom the Greek philosopher Plato – one of the founders of rational westernthought – who had insisted that what he had said on the matter was ‘not fictionbut true history’.22 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts22] Furthermore,writing around the beginning of the fourth century BC, Plato had added that theoriginal source of his story had been an Egyptian priest – a priest who hadspoken of the recurrent destruction of civilizations by floods and who had saidof the Greeks:You are all young in mind … you have no knowledge hoary with age. [But] ourtraditions here are the oldest … In our temples we have preserved from earliesttimes a written record of any great or splendid achievement or notable eventwhich has come to our ears whether it occurred in your part of the world, orhere, or anywhere else; whereas with you, and others, writing and the othernecessities of civilization have only just been developed when the periodicscourge of the deluge descends, and spares none but the unlettered anduncultured, so that you have to begin again like children, in complete ignoranceof what has happened in our part of the world or in yours in early times.Thousands of years before, the priest continued,There was an island opposite the strait which you call the Pillars of Hercules,an island larger than Libya and Asia combined; from it travellers could in thosedays reach the other islands, and from them the whole opposite continent whichsurrounds what can truly be called the ocean. On this island of Atlantis hadarisen a powerful and remarkable dynasty of kings … Their wealth was greaterthan that possessed by any previous dynasty, or likely to be accumulated by anylater, and they were provided with everything they could require. Because of theextent of their power they received many imports, but for most of their needsthe island itself provided. It had mineral resources from which were mined bothsolid materials and metals, including one metal which survives today only inname, but was then mined in quantities in a number of localities in the island,orichalc, in those days the most valuable metal except gold. There was aplentiful supply of timber for structural purposes and every kind of animaldomesticated and wild, among them numerous elephants. For there was plenty ofgrazing for this largest and most voracious of beasts, as well as for allcreatures whose habitat is marsh, swamp and river, mountain or plain. Besidesall this, the earth bore freely of all the aromatic substances it bearstoday … There were cultivated crops … There were the fruits of trees … All thesewere produced by that sacred island, then still beneath the sun, in wonderfulquality and profusion.23 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts23]This paradise was not to remain ‘beneath the sun’ for much longer, however,because soon – to punish its inhabitants for wrongdoing and an overabundance ofmaterialistic pride – there came ‘earthquakes and floods of extraordinaryviolence, and in a single dreadful day and night the island of Atlantis wasswallowed up by the sea and vanished.’24[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts24]My interest in this story did not stem from what it had to say about Atlantisitself, nor was I convinced by the suggestion as to the island’s location‘opposite the pillars of Hercules’. My own view – well supported by geophysicalevidence25 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts25] – was that there couldnever have been such a landmass in the Atlantic Ocean and that those whopersisted in looking for it there were fishing for the reddest of red herrings.It did seem to me, however – and the authorities reluctantly concurred on thispoint26 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts26] – that Plato’s accountmust have had some basis in fact. No doubt he introduced many distortions andexaggerations of his own but he was, nevertheless, recording something that hadactually happened, somewhere in the world, and a very long time ago. Furthermore– and of the greatest significance to me – he made it absolutely clear that amemory of this event had been retained by Egyptian priests and set down in the‘priestly writings’.27 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts27]I reasoned that if a similar memory had been preserved in Mesopotamia then thechance of this being pure coincidence was slight. A far more likely explanationwould be that the same cataclysm – wherever it took place – had inspired thetraditions of both regions. Accordingly I took a second look at the legends inwhich I had first noted the similarity between Thoth and the Sumerian moon-godSin. What I learned did not surprise me: like their Egyptian contemporaries, theSumerians had not only worshipped a wise lunar deity but had also preserved arecord of a flood in ancient times that had destroyed a great, prosperous andpowerful society.28 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts28]As my research progressed, therefore, ‘Atlantis’ did come to symbolize for methat ‘hypothetical and as yet undiscovered area’ from whence the wonderfulcivilizations of Egypt and of Sumer both came. As already noted, I did notbelieve that the area in question could possibly have been in or even near theAtlantic. Instead, I found myself wholeheartedly agreeing with Professor Emerythat it was likely to have stood at a point roughly equidistant from both theNile Delta and the Lower Euphrates – perhaps in some vanished archipelagosimilar to the modern Maldives (which scientists believe will be completelyinundated within fifty years as a result of rising sea levels linked to globalwarming29 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts29]), or along the vastunexcavated coasts of the Horn of Africa, or in a flood-prone region of theIndian subcontinent like modern Bangladesh. Such tropical zones looked all themore credible when I remembered that Plato had mentioned the existence ofelephants in his ‘Atlantis’ – creatures that, for many thousands of years, havelived only in Africa, India and South-East Asia.30[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts30]The more thought I gave to notions like these the more it seemed to me that theypossessed genuine merit and were worthy of further investigation. In order toorientate myself in this task I therefore wrote down the following conjecturesand hypotheses in my notebook:Suppose that somewhere around the basin of the Indian Ocean, in the early ormiddle part of the fourth millennium BC, a technologically advanced society wasdestroyed by flood. Suppose it was a maritime society. Suppose that there weresurvivors. And suppose that some of them sailed in their ships to Egypt andMesopotamia, made landfall there and set about the task of civilizing theprimitive inhabitants they encountered.Most important of all, suppose that in Egypt the priestly traditions of sacredscience – to which Moses was exposed from his childhood – were the means bywhich the skills and know-how of the settlers were deliberately preserved sothat they could be passed down to subsequent generations. In Egypt thesetraditions were associated from the outset with the worship of the moon-godThoth (and, in Mesopotamia, with the worship of Sin). Perhaps this was becausethe settlers themselves revered the moon – or perhaps they wittingly and rathercold-bloodedly encouraged the deification of a prominent and familiar but yetfrightening and ghostly sidereal object. Their aim, after all, would have beento shape and direct the simple and savage minds of the peoples they had foundthemselves amongst and to create a durable cult – capable of surviving formillennia – as a vehicle for all their otherwise fragile and easily forgottenknowledge. In such circumstances, it is really not difficult to see why theymight have chosen to focus on a glowing and uncanny lunar god rather than onsome more abstract, more sophisticated but less visible and less corporealdivinity.At any rate, once the cult of Thoth had been established in early Egypt, andonce its priests had learned and institutionalized the scientific andtechnological ‘tricks of the trade’ brought by the settlers, then it is logicalto suppose that a self-perpetuating process would have begun: the new-found andvaluable knowledge would have been fenced about with mysteries, protected fromoutsiders by all kinds of ritual sanctions and then passed from initiate toinitiate, from generation to generation, in an exclusive and secret tradition.This knowledge, of course, would have given its possessors unprecedented masteryover the physical world – at least by the rudimentary standards of the nativeculture prevailing in Egypt before the coming of the settlers – and would havebeen expressed in ways that would have seemed astounding to laymen (not least inthe erection of stupendous and awe-inspiring buildings). It is therefore easy tounderstand how the belief that the moon-god had ‘invented’ both science andmagic might have taken hold in the population at large, and why it was that thepriests of this god were regarded as masters of sorcery.SAVED FROM WATERAs my research progressed I turned up several pieces of evidence which seemed toprovide strong support for the central hypotheses listed above, namely that asecret tradition of knowledge and enlightenment had been ‘carried’ and preservedwithin the cult of Thoth – a tradition that had been started in the most distantpast by sophisticated immigrants who had survived a flood. Highly significant,in this respect, was a very strong theme – traces of which I found runningthrough almost all the sacred literature – which repeatedly associated wisdom,and other qualities of the civilizing hero, with individuals who had been ‘savedfrom water’.The first thing I discovered was that Thoth, who had been seen by the Egyptiansas the source of all their knowledge and science, had been credited with havingcaused a flood to punish humankind for wickedness.31[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts31] In this episode, related inChapter CLXXV of the Book of the Dead, he had acted jointly with his counterpartOsiris.32 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts32] Both deities hadsubsequently ruled on earth after the human race had begun to flourish again. Iwas therefore excited, when I looked more closely at the story of Osiris, tolearn that he had been ‘saved from water’.The fullest account of the original Egyptian legend was given by Plutarch33[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts33] and stated that, after improvingthe condition of his own subjects, teaching them all manner of useful skills andproviding them with their first legal code, Osiris left Egypt and travelledabout the world in order to bring the benefits of civilization to other nationsas well. He never forced the barbarians he encountered to accept his laws,preferring instead to argue with them and to appeal to their reason. It was alsorecorded that he passed on his teaching to them by means of hymns and songsaccompanied by musical instruments.While he was away, however, he was plotted against by seventy-two members of hiscourt led by his brother-in-law Set. On his return the conspirators invited himto a banquet where a splendid coffer of wood and gold was offered as a prize toany guest who could fit into it exactly. What Osiris did not know was that thecoffer had been constructed precisely to his own body measurements. As a result,when the assembled guests tried one by one to get into it they failed. Thegod-king then took his turn and lay down comfortably inside. Before he had timeto get out the conspirators rushed forward, nailed the lid tightly closed andsealed even the cracks with molten lead so that there would be no air tobreathe. The coffer was then cast adrift on the Nile where it floated for sometime, eventually coming to rest in the papyrus swamps of the eastern Delta.34[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts34]At this point Isis, the wife of Osiris, intervened. Using all her great magic –and assisted by the moon-god Thoth – she went to look for the coffer, found it,and concealed it in a secret place. Her evil brother Set, however, out huntingin the marshes, discovered the location of the coffer, opened it, and in a madfury cut the royal corpse into fourteen pieces which he then scatteredthroughout the land.Once more Isis set off to ‘save’ her husband. She made a small boat of papyrusreeds, coated with bitumen and pitch, and embarked on the Nile in search of theremains. When she had found them she called again on the aid of Thoth who helpedher to work certain powerful spells which reunited the dismembered parts of thebody so that it resumed its old form. Thereafter, in an intact and perfectstate, Osiris went through a process of resurrection to become god of the deadand king of the underworld – from which place, the legend had it, heoccasionally returned to earth in the guise of a mortal man.35[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts35]There were three details of this story that I regarded as being of the greatestinterest: first the fact that, during his rule on earth, Osiris was a civilizerand a legislator; secondly that he was placed in a wooden coffer and thrown intothe Nile; and thirdly that Isis came to rescue his body in a papyrus boat coatedwith bitumen and pitch. The parallels with the life of Moses could not have beenmore obvious – he, too, became a great civilizer and lawgiver, he too was castadrift upon the waters of the Nile, he too floated in a vessel of papyrus coatedwith bitumen and pitch, and he too was saved by an Egyptian princess. Indeed, asthe historian Josephus recorded, the very name ‘Moses’ meant ‘saved from water’:‘for the Egyptians call water mou and those who are saved eses; so theyconferred upon him this name compounded of both words.’36[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts36] Philo, the other great classicalcommentator, concurred with this etymology: ‘Since he had been taken up fromwater, the princess gave him a name derived from this, and called him Moses, forMou is the Egyptian word for water.’37[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts37]I asked myself whether there might not have been other instances – in Egypt andperhaps in Mesopotamia as well – of civilizing heroes who had been saved fromwater. A search in ancient annals and legends revealed that there had been many.For example Horus, the son of Isis and Osiris, was murdered by Titans and throwninto the Nile. Isis rescued him and revived him with her sorcery. He thenlearned from her ‘the arts of physic and divination and used them for thebenefit of mankind’.38 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts38] Likewise,in Mesopotamia, Sargon the Great – whose rule brought unrivalled wealth,splendour and stability to Sumer and neighbouring territories at the end of thethird millennium BC39 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts39] – hadclaimed quite specifically to have been saved from water:My mother was a priestess. I did not know my father. The priestess, my mother,conceived me and gave birth to me in hiding. She placed me in a basket made ofreeds and closed the lid with pitch. She put the basket in the river which wasnot high. The river carried me away and brought me to Akki who was a manresponsible for libations. Akki looked upon me with kindness and drew me fromthe river.40 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts40]I found that the theme of salvation from water also ran very strongly throughthe pages of the Old Testament. The prophet Jonah, for instance, was thrown intothe sea during a raging tempest, swallowed alive by a giant fish and three dayslater ‘vomited out upon dry land’ so that he could preach the word of God to thecitizens of Nineveh and divert them from their evil ways.41[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts41]Even more familiar was the much more ancient story of Noah, who – together withall his family and with ‘two of every sort of living thing’42[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts42] – rode out the primeval deluge ina remarkable survival ship which we know as the ark (‘make it with reeds andline it with pitch inside and out’43[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts43]). After the flood waters hadreceded, Noah’s three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, heard God’s command to ‘befruitful and multiply’ and went out to repopulate the world.44[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts44]By far the most famous and influential biblical figure to be ‘saved from water’,however, was Jesus Christ himself – the only individual, other than Moses, to bedescribed in the Scriptures as ‘mighty in deed and word’45[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts45] (a phrase which, as I alreadyknew, implied proficiency in the utterance of magical words of power). Ratherthan being an actual rescue, the incident in question was wholly symbolic andtook the form of the mysterious rite of baptism in the waters of the riverJordan. This, Jesus explained, was absolutely necessary for salvation: ‘Except aman be born of water … he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.’46[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts46]And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, andwas baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway coming up out of the water, hesaw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. Andthere came a voice from heaven saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I amwell pleased.47 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts47]Though I knew that the vast majority of practising Christians took this passagefrom the Gospel of Saint Mark entirely at face value I could not help but wonderwhether a deeper layer of meaning might not have been encoded in the stirringand beautiful words. It seemed to me at least possible that what was reallybeing described here was the initiation of Jesus into the enlightened knowledgeof a secret cult whose founders were literally ‘saved from water’ thousands ofyears earlier. Furthermore, I thought it not accidental that it was only afterthis initiation that Christ began to work his miracles – most of which(including healing the sick, restoring the dead to life, multiplying loaves andfishes, and controlling the elements) would have been instantly recognizable tothe High Priests and sorcerers of ancient Egypt as ‘magic tricks’ of the typethat they, too, had been trained to perform.48[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts48]After considering all the data that I had compiled I made the following entry inmy notebook:The theme of the civilizer, or founding father, or great prophet, or legislator,or Messiah who has in one way or another been ‘saved from water’ occurs in theScriptures, and in Egyptian and Middle Eastern mythology, so frequently and withsuch consistency that it cannot be a matter of pure chance. I am not proposingthat all the individuals concerned were actual survivors of that ‘hypotheticaland as yet undiscovered area’, that supposed technologically advanced societywhich may have been the cradle for the civilizations of both Mesopotamia andEgypt. The fact is that only Noah, Osiris – and perhaps Horus – belong to aperiod of pre-history sufficiently remote to qualify them for that distinction.Sargon, Moses, Jonah, and Jesus, however (together with many other importantfigures in different places and at different periods), were all also saved fromwater – either literally or symbolically. It therefore seems to me that what isreally implied by this recurrent image is initiation of the individualsconcerned into a tradition of secret wisdom started a very long time ago by thesurvivors of a flood in an effort to preserve vital knowledge and skills thatmight otherwise have quickly been forgotten.Going beyond what could be deduced from myths and legends, I also found somerather more tangible evidence in Egypt to support the ‘saved from water theory’.I knew that this evidence – the concealment of complete ocean-going boats besidealmost all the most important tombs of pharaohs and notables, and also near allthe pyramids – had thus far been treated by archaeologists according to thehoary old dictum that ‘if you can’t understand a particular custom then thesafest thing to do is to put it down to religion’. It gradually dawned on me,however, that the practice of boat burial could well have been motivated bysomething other than a simple desire to install near the grave a ‘physicalrepresentation of the symbolic craft that would take the soul or spirit of thedead king to its ultimate destination in the sky.’49[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts49]A prime case in point was the cedarwood ship discovered buried and dismantled ina pit beside the southern edge of the Great Pyramid at Giza and now reassembledin a special museum on site. Still in perfect condition 4,500 years after it wasbuilt, I learnt that this giant vessel was more than 142 feet long and had adisplacement of around 40 tons. Its design was particularly interesting,incorporating (in the informed opinion of Thor Heyerdahl) ‘all the sea-goingship’s characteristic properties, with prow and stern soaring upward, higherthan in a Viking ship, to ride out the breakers and high seas, not to contendwith the little ripples of the Nile.’50[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts50] Another expert felt that thecareful and clever construction of this strange pyramid boat would have made it‘a far more seaworthy craft than anything available to Columbus’; indeed, itwould probably have had no difficulty in sailing round the world!51[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts51]Since the ancient Egyptians were highly skilled at making scale models andrepresentations of all manner of things for symbolic purposes52[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts52] it seemed to me implausible thatthey would have gone to such trouble to manufacture and then bury a boat assophisticated as this one if their only purpose had been to betoken thespiritual vessel that would carry off the soul of the king to heaven. That couldhave been achieved just as effectively with a much smaller craft. Besides, Ilearnt that recent research at Giza had revealed the existence of another hugeboat, also on the south side of the pyramid, still sealed in its pit – and therewere also known to be three (now empty) rock-hewn pits on the eastern side. Asone otherwise orthodox Egyptologist rather daringly admitted, ‘it is difficultto see why so many boat pits should have been thought necessary.’ Predictably hethen fell back on the great standby of all puzzled scholars and declared: ‘it isclear that their presence was required for some religious purpose relating tothe afterlife of the king.’53 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts53]It was precisely this point, however, which was not clear to me at all –particularly since, as noted in the previous chapter, there was absolutely noindication that any pharaoh was ever interred within the Great Pyramid.Furthermore, the earliest funerary boats to be discovered in Egypt dated back tothat mysterious period, just before the inception of the First Dynasty, whencivilization and technology in the Nile Valley underwent a sudden andinexplicable transformation.54 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts54] Itherefore found it difficult to resist the conclusion that the curious practiceof boat burial was more likely to be linked to the well established tradition of‘salvation from water’ than to any purely religious symbolism. Sturdyocean-going vessels, I reasoned, would have been of immense importance to agroup of foreigners who had survived a flood and who had settled in Egypt aftersailing away from the site of the cataclysm. Perhaps they, or those who cameafter them, had believed that the buried boats might one day be needed – not toenable reincarnated souls to navigate the heavens like celestial pleasuretrippers but, instead, to allow living individuals to escape once again from thescourge of some terrible deluge.HIDDEN RICHES OF SECRET PLACESThe really great achievements of ancient Egypt all took place early. The peakperiod spanned the Third to the Fifth Dynasties – roughly from 2900 BC to 2300BC. Thereafter, albeit gradually and with some notable resurgences, the generaltrend was steadily downhill.55 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts55]This scenario – accepted by all scholars – was, I felt, completely consistentwith the theory that civilization was brought into the Nile Valley during thefourth millennium BC from some technologically advanced but as yet unidentifiedarea. After all, one would not have expected an imported culture to produce itsmost perfect forms of expression from the very moment that the settlers arrived;there would undoubtedly have been a great leap forward at that time but the fullpotential would not have been realized until the native inhabitants had pickedup and learned the new techniques.And this was precisely what seemed to have happened in Egypt. Just before thebeginning of the First Dynasty (say around 3400 BC), writing, arithmetic,medicine, astronomy and a complex religion all appeared very suddenly – without,as already noted, any local evidence of prior evolution in any of these spheres.At the same time highly sophisticated monuments and tombs were being built thatincorporated advanced architectural concepts – again with no trace of evolution.The First and Second Dynasties (say from 3300 BC onwards) saw the constructionof ever more elaborate monuments which embodied with increasing confidence andvigour the new-found skills and knowledge that had arrived in Egypt.56[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts56] And this trend towards greaterand greater beauty and excellence received what many modern scholars regarded asits ultimate expression in the remarkable stone edifices of the funerary complexof King Zoser, the first Pharaoh of the Third Dynasty.The complex, which I visited several times in 1989 and 1990, is dominated by atowering six-tiered pyramid 197 feet high and is located to the south of thecity of Cairo at Saqqara. The complete site takes the form of a rectangle nearly2,000 feet long and 1,000 feet wide and was originally enclosed by a singlemassive stone wall, large sections of which are still standing. Other featuresinclude an extensive colonnade with forty tall columns, an elegant courtyard,and numerous shrines, temples and outbuildings – all on a colossal scale butwith clean and delicate lines.I was able to establish that in Egyptian tradition the conception and design ofthe entire Zoser complex had been regarded as the work of a single creativegenius – Imhotep the Builder, whose other titles were Sage, Sorcerer, Architect,High Priest, Astronomer and Doctor.57[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts57] I became interested in thislegendary figure because of the great emphasis put by subsequent generations onhis scientific and magical abilities; indeed, like Osiris, his achievements inthese fields were so highly regarded that he was eventually deified. Withuniquely impressive engineering feats such as the Zoser pyramid to his credit,Imhotep looked to me like an obvious candidate for membership of the cult ofThoth: the monuments at Saqqara seemed eloquently to confirm that he hadassimilated and then put brilliantly into practice the technological dexteritypeculiar to that cult.I was therefore excited to discover that Imhotep was often characterized ininscriptions as ‘the image and likeness of Thoth’58[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts58] – and also as the ‘successor toThoth’ after the deity had ascended to heaven.59[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts59] I then learnt something of evengreater significance: in antiquity, Moses too was frequently compared to Thoth(indeed, in the second century BC an entire work was filled with suchcomparisons by the Judaeo-Greek philosopher Artapanus, who credited the prophetwith a range of remarkable and clearly ‘scientific’ inventions60[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts60]).The fact that individuals as far apart in history as Moses and Imhotep shouldhave been explicitly linked through the cult of the moon-god struck me as strongcircumstantial evidence not only for the existence of a secret wisdom traditionbut also for the durability of that tradition. Accordingly I began to wonderwhether there had been other magicians and sages like Imhotep to whom the designof particularly sophisticated and advanced buildings had been attributed.Unfortunately, no record survived of the architect who built the Great Pyramidat Giza. This remarkable edifice was certainly the crowning achievement of thesplendid Fourth Dynasty – during which Egyptian civilization reached its zenith.As one authority put it:The Pharaohs would never again build to such scale and perfection. And thislevel of expertise carried over into almost every other form of art or craft.Under the Fourth Dynasty the furniture was the most elegant, the linen thefinest, the statuary at once the most powerful and the most perfect … Certainskills, such as the making of inlaid eyes, reached levels that border on thesupernatural. Later dynasties could produce but mediocre versions and ultimatelythe knowledge disappeared entirely.61[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts61]I could only agree with most of the above remarks. It seemed to me, however,that the very special technological skills required for the erection of splendidand imposing monuments had been preserved for a considerable period before‘disappearing entirely’. Though not given any practical expression, for example,there was no doubt that these skills had somehow survived the many centuries ofcultural stagnation that set in after the Fourth Dynasty and had then reassertedthemselves in the remarkable resurgence that occurred during the Eighteenth andNineteenth Dynasties (1580–1200 BC).The crowning achievement of this latter era, which filled me with awe every timeI set eyes on it, was the beautiful obelisk of Queen Hatshepsut at Karnak.Nearby, on the western side of the Nile, the same monarch had also commissioneda massive mortuary temple that had later come to be regarded as one of the greatarchitectural masterpieces of the world.62[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts62]I learnt that the name of the long-dead architect responsible for both of thesemonuments had been Senmut. Intriguingly, an inscription that he himself hadcomposed – and that could still be read on his tomb wall – left little doubtthat his special knowledge and abilities had been acquired after he had beenadmitted to the mysteries of an ancient and secret wisdom tradition. ‘Havingpenetrated all the writings of the Divine Prophets,’ he boasted, ‘I was ignorantof nothing that has happened since the beginning of time.’63[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts63]Suppose [I wrote in my notebook] that Moses (who lived barely 200 years afterSenmut) was also an initiate in this same secret tradition – a tradition thatstretched back beyond the horizon of history through Imhotep to the god-kingsThoth and Osiris, and that extended forward as well to include other greatscientists and civilizers like Jesus Christ. If there is anything at all to thishypothesis then is it not possible that some of the truly extraordinary thinkersof more recent years may also have been heirs to the ‘occult’ knowledge thatinspired the builders of the pyramids and obelisks, and that made it possiblefor Moses to perform his miracles?In seeking to answer this question, I was drawn back first and foremost to theKnights Templar – who had occupied the original site of the Temple of Solomon inJerusalem in AD 1119 and who, I believed, had learned something in the Holy Citythat had subsequently caused them to seek the Ark of the Covenant in Ethiopia.As reported in Chapter 5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c05_r1.htm], the research thatI had carried out into the beliefs and behaviour of this strange group ofwarrior monks had convinced me that they had tapped into some exceedinglyancient wisdom tradition – and that the knowledge they had thus acquired hadbeen put to use in the construction of churches and castles that werearchitecturally far in advance of other buildings of the twelfth and thirteenthcenturies.Was it not possible, I now asked myself, that the wisdom tradition into whichthe Templars had been initiated had been the very one to which Moses, Senmut andImhotep had belonged? And if so then was it not also possible that the knights’quest for the Ark had been connected to this tradition? I knew that it wouldprobably prove impossible to substantiate such esoteric guesswork. Nevertheless,I was excited to discover a number of ancient Jewish traditions which assertedthat the Ark had contained ‘the root of all knowledge’.64[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts64] In addition, as the reader willrecall, the golden lid of the sacred relic had been surmounted by two figures ofcherubim. Could it therefore have been pure coincidence that, in Judaic lore,‘the distinctive gift of the cherubim was knowledge’?65[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts65]These were by no means the only tantalizing hints which suggested to me that thequest for the Ark might also have been a quest for wisdom. Equally significantwas the fact that when the Templars were persecuted, tortured and put on trialin the early fourteenth century many of them confessed to worshipping amysterious bearded head, the name of which was given as Baphomet.66[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts66] Several authorities, pointing tothe close connections that the knights had cultivated with Islamic mystics, hadidentified Baphomet with Muhammad67[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts67] – thus blithely ignoring the factthat Islam could hardly have inspired such behaviour (since Muslims, as I wasvery well aware, regarded their prophet as human not divine and had an absoluteabhorrence of any kind of idol worship). A far more convincing explanation,however, was given by Dr Hugh Schonfield, an expert on early Christianity, whohad deciphered a secret code used in a number of the famous ‘Dead Sea Scrolls’ –a code that the Templars might easily have learned during their long residencein the Holy Land. Dr Schonfield showed that if the name Baphomet were written inthis code and then transliterated the result would be the Greek word Sophia.68[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts68] And the Greek word Sophia, in itsturn, meant nothing more nor less than ‘Wisdom’.69[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts69]By this analysis, therefore, when the Templars worshipped Baphomet what theywere really doing was worshipping the principle of Wisdom. And that, of course,was exactly what the ancient Egyptians had done when they had worshipped Thothas ‘the personification of the mind of God’,70[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts70] as ‘the author of every work onevery branch of knowledge, both human and divine’,71[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts71] and as ‘the inventor of astronomyand astrology, the science of numbers and mathematics, geometry and landsurveying, medicine and botany’.72[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts72] I was encouraged to look further.One fact which quite quickly came to light was that the Freemasons had also heldThoth in special regard. Indeed, according to a very old Masonic tradition,Thoth ‘had played a major part in preserving knowledge of the mason craft andtransmitting it to mankind after the flood’.73[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts73] And the author of a wellresearched academic study on the origins of Freemasonry went so far as to saythat, in their early days, the Masons had regarded Thoth as their patron.74[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts74] I was already aware (see Chapter7 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c07_r1.htm]) that close links had existed between theTemplars and the Freemasons, with the latter almost certainly being descendedfrom the former. Now I could see that what I was coming to think of as the‘Thoth connection’ set those links in the ancient and enduring context of awisdom tradition stretching back to Pharaonic times. I therefore asked myselfthis: in addition to the Templars and the Masons had there been any other groupsor individuals whose works and ideas had appeared unusually advanced – and whomight possibly have been initiates in the same wisdom tradition?I found that there had been many. For example, Copernicus, the Renaissanceastronomer whose theory of a heliocentric universe had overturned theearth-centred complacency of the Middle Ages, had said quite openly that he hadarrived at his revolutionary insights by studying the secret writings of theancient Egyptians, including the hidden works of Thoth himself.75[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts75] Likewise the seventeenth-centurymathematician Kepler (who, amongst other things, compiled an imaginary accountof a trip to the moon) admitted that in formulating his laws of the planetaryorbits he was merely ‘stealing the golden vessels of the Egyptians’.76[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts76]In a similar vein, Sir Isaac Newton had stated his view that ‘the Egyptiansconcealed mysteries that were above the capacity of the common herd under theveil of religious rites and hieroglyphic symbols.’77[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts77] Amongst these mysteries, hebelieved, was the knowledge that the earth orbited the sun and not vice-versa:‘It was the most ancient opinion that the planets revolved about the sun, thatthe earth, as one of the planets, described an annual course about the sun,while by a diurnal motion it turned on its axis, and that the sun remained atrest.’78 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts78]Newton’s profound intellect and scholarship had enabled him to lay thefoundations of physics as a modern discipline. His specific achievements hadincluded epoch-making discoveries in mechanics, optics, astronomy andmathematics (the binomial theorem and the differential and integral calculus),huge steps forward in the understanding of the nature of light, and – above allelse – the formulation of the universal law of gravitation which had alteredforever mankind’s vision of the cosmos.What was much less well known about the great English scientist, however, wasthe fact that he had spent a significant part of his adult life deeply immersedin hermetic and alchemical literature (more than a tenth of his personal libraryhad been taken up with alchemical treatises79[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts79]). Furthermore he had beenobsessed – literally obsessed – with the notion that a secret wisdom layconcealed within the pages of the Scriptures: Daniel of the Old Testament andJohn of the New particularly attracted him because ‘the language of theprophetic writings was symbolic and hieroglyphical and their comprehensionrequired a radically different method of interpretation.’80[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts80]It seemed to me, as I researched Newton further, that pursuit of this methodperhaps explained why he had involved himself in an exacting study of sometwenty different versions of the book of Revelation. He had learned Hebrew inorder to do the job properly81 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts81]and had then carried out a similarly meticulous exercise on the book ofEzekiel.82 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts82] I was also able toestablish that he had drawn on the information contained in this latter work toproduce a painstaking reconstruction of the floorplan of the Temple of Solomon.Why? Because he had been convinced that the great edifice built to house the Arkof the Covenant had been a kind of cryptogram of the universe; if he coulddecipher this cryptogram, he had believed, then he would know the mind of God.83[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts83]Newton’s Temple floorplan had been preserved in the Babson College Library.84[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts84] Meanwhile the seventeenth-centuryscientist had expressed his other ‘theological’ findings and observations inprivate writings that had totalled well over a million words.85[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts85] In the mid-twentieth centurythese rather surprising manuscripts came to light and were purchased at auctionby John Maynard Keynes. ‘Newton was not the first of the age of reason,’ theobviously shaken economist later told the Royal Society, ‘he was the last of themagicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind whichlooked out on the world with the same eyes as those who began to build ourintellectual inheritance rather less than ten thousand years ago.’ Keynes madean extremely careful study of the manuscripts and concluded – significantly inmy view – that Newton sawthe whole universe and all that is in it as a riddle, as a secret which could beread by applying pure thought to certain evidence, certain mystic clues whichGod had hid about the world to allow a sort of philosopher’s treasure hunt tothe esoteric brotherhood. He believed that these clues were to be found partlyin the evidence of the heavens and in the constitution of elements, but alsopartly in certain papers and traditions handed down by the brethren in anunbroken chain back to the original cryptic revelation.86[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts86]Indeed so! And although I knew that I might never be able to prove that the‘brethren’ in question had been directly linked to the occult traditions of themoon-god Thoth – and to those scientists and civilizers who had been ‘saved fromwater’ – I felt that there was at least sufficient evidence to confirm oneintriguing fact. In making his greatest discoveries, Newton had indicatedseveral times that he had drawn not only upon his own genius but also upon somevery old and secret repository of wisdom. He had once stated quite explicitly,for instance, that the law of gravitation expounded in his Principia was not newbut rather had been known and fully understood in ancient times; he had arrivedat it by decoding the sacred literature of past ages.87[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts87] On another occasion he haddescribed Thoth as a believer in the Copernican system.88[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts88] Before that he had alignedhimself with the German physician and alchemist Michael Maier (1568–1622) whohad argued that, throughout history, all the true adepts of science had derivedtheir knowledge from the Egyptian moon-god.89[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts89]Amongst many other curiosities, I discovered that Newton had been struck by thefact that ‘there was a general tradition of deluge amongst ancient peoples’90[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts90] and had shown considerableinterest in the biblical view that Noah was the common ancestor of allhumanity.91 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts91] Moreover, despite hisown devoutly held religious convictions, he seemed at times to have seen Christas an especially gifted man and as an interpreter of God’s masterplan, ratherthan as the Son of God.92 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts92] What Ifound most fascinating of all, however, was that the really pivotal figure inNewton’s theology, and in his conception of early science, had been none otherthan the prophet Moses, whom he had regarded as an adept in the mysteries of theuniverse, a master of alchemy, and a witness to the double revelation of God (asexpressed in His word and in His works).93[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts93]Long centuries before our own enlightened era, Newton had believed, Mosesunderstood that matter consisted of atoms, and that these atoms were hard, solidand immutable: ‘gravity accrued to both atoms and to the bodies they composed;gravity was proportional to the quantity of matter in every body.’94[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts94] Newton had also regarded theaccount of creation presented in Genesis – and attributed to Moses – as anallegorical description of an alchemical process:Moses, that ancient Theologue, describing and expressing ye most wonderfulArchitecture of this great world, tells us that ye spirit of God moved upon yewaters which was an indigested chaos, or mass created before by God.Later, referring to the efforts of the alchemists, the great English scientisthad added:Just as the world was created from dark chaos through the bringing forth of thelight and through the separation of the aery firmament and of the waters fromthe earth, so our work brings forth the beginning out of black chaos and itsfirst matter through the separation of the elements and the illumination ofmatter.95 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts95]Last but not least, I thought it was not accidental that Newton’s favouritebiblical passage96 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts96] had been onethat had hinted at the existence of some form of covert knowledge available onlyto initiates:And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secretplaces, that thou mayest know that I, the Lord, which call thee by thy name, amthe God of Israel.97 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts97]I reasoned that if Newton had indeed had access to the same ‘treasures ofdarkness’ and to the same ‘hidden riches’ as Moses, then this would imply – atthe very least – the continuous existence over a period of millennia of aclandestine sect or cult structured to pass on an exclusive and privilegedwisdom. This sounded far-fetched; it was, however, by no means impossible. Onthe contrary, knowledge and skills had frequently and successfully beentransferred down the generations – and from one region of the world to another –without any concrete evidence being available to document the process. Forexample, Rhabdas, a mathematician who had lived in the city of Constantinople inthe twelfth century AD, was known to have used a method for deriving squareroots that had existed only in ancient Egypt more than two thousand yearspreviously and that had not, otherwise, been employed elsewhere.98[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts98] How, and from where, he hadacquired this technique was not easy to explain. Similarly, I was very muchaware that the transmission of esoteric information, coupled with the teachingand sharing of arcane rituals and ceremonies, had occurred for centuries withinthe various Masonic orders without any public record ever being available.Charting the contours of a genuinely reticent sect was, therefore, a dauntingundertaking. But what I found more daunting by far was the task of guessing thereal nature of the science and technology that such a long-lived and secretiveinstitution as the cult of Thoth might have protected and preserved –particularly if, as I suspected, that science and technology had originated in ahistorically remote and now utterly obliterated culture. As I wrote in mynotebook:It would be a mistake to assume that our own twentieth-century machinery andinventions are any guideline; on the contrary, if an advanced society did existat some archaic period, then its wisdom is likely to have been quite differentfrom anything with which we are familiar, and its machines could reasonably beexpected to have operated according to principles unknown to us.A MONSTROUS INSTRUMENTIt was with such thoughts, as my research moved on, that I found myself drawn tothe strange passages in the Old Testament books of Exodus and Deuteronomy whichdescribed the encounters between God and Moses on Mount Sinai. Amidst thunderand fire, electrical storms and clouds of smoke, Yahweh supposedly disclosed theblueprint of the Ark of the Covenant to the Hebrew magus and presented him withthe stone Tablets of the Law inscribed with the Ten Commandments. Then the Arkitself was built by the artificer Bezaleel who slavishly followed the ‘divine’plan, almost as though he knew that he was forging some monstrous instrument.And this, I suspect, is what the Ark really was: a monstrous instrument capableof releasing fearful energies in an uncontrolled and catastrophic manner if itwas mishandled or misused in any way – an instrument that was not conceived inthe mind of God, as the Bible teaches, but rather in the mind of Moses.A master sorcerer in an era when sorcery and science were indistinguishable fromone another, it is after all possible (and perhaps more than possible) thatMoses could have had the technical knowledge – and therefore the ability – todesign a device of this sort. There is absolutely no proof of this, of course.Nevertheless I think that only those with a pedantic and cavilling attitude tohistory would insist that the ancient wisdom traditions of Egypt could havecontained no special skills or ideas of a technical nature on which the prophetmight have drawn in order to imbue the Ark with the awesome powers attributed toit in the Old Testament.Speculation on such matters is surely healthy and – for those readers who areinterested in penetrating more deeply into the mystery – I offer the followinghypotheses and conjectures as food for thought.MOTIVE AND OPPORTUNITYAssume for a moment that Moses did indeed have the technical knowledge to create‘a monstrous instrument’ capable of destroying city walls (as in the case ofJericho99 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts99]), striking people dead(as in the case of Uzzah and the ‘men of Bethshemesh’100[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts100]), inflicting cancerous tumourson those who approached it without proper protection (as in the case of thePhilistines after the battle of Ebenezer101[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts101]), and counteracting gravity (asin the case of the bearers whom, on one occasion, it ‘tossed into the air andflung to the ground again and again’102[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts102]).If Moses could have made such a machine then it only remains to ask whether hehad a motive to do so, and whether he had the opportunity.I would like to suggest that he had ample motive. One in a long line ofcivilizing heroes who had been ‘saved from water’, there is evidence to suggestthat his prime objective in life might not have been to establish the Jewishfaith (although he certainly did that) but rather to civilize the Israelites –who, prior to the Exodus, were little more than an anarchic tribe of migrantlabourers marooned in Egypt.Suppose that the prophet decided to inspire (and thus mobilize) this primitiveand almost ungovernable group of nomads by convincing them that he was going tolead them to the ‘Promised Land’ – Canaan – which he had enticingly depicted as‘a good land and a large … a land flowing with milk and honey’.103[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts103] If so then he was far too wily aleader, and far too astute a judge of human frailty, to take what was basicallya disorganized rabble straight there. He knew that they would face formidablefoes when they eventually arrived; if they were to overcome these foes,therefore, he would first need to mould and shape them, bend them to his will,and impose some discipline upon them.This reasoning appeals to me because it seems to offer a logical explanation forsomething that otherwise makes very little sense – namely the fact that theIsraelites supposedly spent forty years wandering in the inhospitablewildernesses of the Sinai peninsula.104[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts104] There were, at the time, atleast two well known and much-frequented trade routes which normally enabledtravellers to cross the deserts between Egypt and Canaan in just a few days.105[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts105] It seems to me, therefore, thatMoses’s decision not to use these highways (and instead to inflict a lengthyperiod of hardship on his people) could only have been a deliberate andcalculated strategy: he must have seen this as the best way to get theIsraelites into shape for the conquest of the Promised Land.106[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts106]Such a strategy, however, would also have had its drawbacks – notably theproblem of persuading the tribesmen to stick together in the desert and to putup with all the difficulties and austerities of nomadic life. This problem wastruly a knotty one: the biblical account of the wanderings in the wildernessmakes it painfully clear that Moses had a hard time trying to keep his people’sconfidence and to force them to obey him. It was true that they fell brieflyinto line whenever he worked some new miracle (and he was obliged to work many);on other occasions, however – and particularly when they faced adversity – theyseethed with discontent, criticized him bitterly and sometimes rebelled openlyagainst him.107 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts107]In such circumstances, is it not reasonable to suppose that the prophet mighthave seen the need to equip himself with some sort of portable ‘miracle machine’to enthral and impress the Israelites whenever and wherever a bit of ‘magic’ wasrequired? And wasn’t that exactly what the Ark was – a portable miracle machinewhich Moses used to ensure that the people would obey him no matter howdifficult the circumstances?Examples of the sacred object being used in precisely this manner are not hardto find in the Bible. Indeed a dramatic change appears to have taken place inMoses’s behaviour after the building of the Ark. Previously he had responded tothe incessant demands and complaints of the Israelites with relatively minoracts of wizardry – striking a desert rock with his wand in order to make freshwater gush forth from it,108 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts108]extracting potable water from a stagnant pool,109[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts109] delivering food in the form ofmanna and quails,110 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts110] and so onand so forth. Later, however, the prophet did not bother with conjuring trickslike these. Instead, whenever the people grumbled, rebelled against him, ordared to dispute his leadership in any way he simply turned the Ark on them –with predictably dreadful results.On one fairly typical occasion he used it to inflict a disfiguring skincondition on his sister Miriam because she had questioned his authority.111[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts111] The Bible calls this skincondition ‘leprosy’.112 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts112] WhenMiriam had been suitably chastened, however, her sores vanished. Since they hadappeared in the first place immediately after she had been exposed to themysterious cloud that sometimes issued forth from between the two cherubimmounted on the Ark’s lid, it is most unlikely that they were actually caused byleprosy.113 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts113] Might they notrather have been induced by some chemical or other contaminant released from theArk itself?Miriam was not the only person to have been affected in this way after incurringMoses’s wrath. Moreover other dissidents not lucky enough to be members of thepriestly family tended to be punished with even greater severity. A particularlyinteresting series of events occurred in response to a mutiny in which theascendancy of Moses and Aaron was openly questioned:Two hundred and fifty of the sons of Israel joined forces against Moses andAaron saying, You take too much on yourselves! The whole community and all itsmembers are consecrated, and Yahweh lives among them, Why set yourselves higherthan the community of Yahweh?114 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts114]Moses was at first so shocked by this insubordination that he ‘fell upon hisface’.115 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts115] He quickly recovered,however, and proposed the following ‘test’: to find out whether the two hundredand fifty rebels were really as ‘holy’ as he was, he suggested that they shouldeach fill a bronze censer with incense and that they should then come in beforethe Ark to burn this incense.116 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts116]If this was done, he argued, it would allow Yahweh to ‘choose the one who is theconsecrated man’.117 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts117]The challenge was accepted: ‘And they took every man his censer, and put fire inthem, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the Tabernacle … withMoses and Aaron.’118 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts118] No soonerhad this gathering taken place than ‘the glory of Yahweh appeared’.119[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts119] Then the deity supposedly gavehis ‘favourites’ a three-second warning of what he was about to do: ‘Yahwehspoke to Moses and Aaron. He said, “Stand apart from this assembly, I am goingto destroy them here and now.” ’120[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts120] At this, the prophet and theHigh Priest ‘threw themselves face downward on the ground … And there came out afire [from the Ark] and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offeredincense.’121 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts121]Afterwards,the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, weall perish … Whosoever cometh anything near unto the tabernacle of the Lordshall die: shall we be consumed with dying?122[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts122]They had, it seemed, learned a salutary lesson. Subdued by the powers of theArk, they mounted no further rebellions of any significance. On the contrary,apart from a few low-key gripes and murmurs, they fell very much into linebehind Moses and did exactly what he told them to do during the remainder oftheir sojourn in the wilderness.So much, then, for motive. Moses clearly had great need of a portable miraclemachine exactly like the Ark. Moreover, once he had equipped himself with thatmachine – if machine it indeed was – he showed no hesitation in using it.Motive and ability alone, however, do not add up to a coherent case. The nextquestion, therefore, is this: did he have the opportunity to prepare a properblueprint for the Ark and to fabricate some sort of ‘power-pack’ for it – somesort of energy source by means of which it might be activated?The answer is yes – ample opportunity. To understand why it is worth recallingthe main events of Moses’s life, in the order that they occurred:1 He was born in Egypt.2 He was cast adrift on the Nile in a basket made of papyrus reeds coated withbitumen and pitch.3 He was ‘saved from water’ by the daughter of Pharaoh.4 He was reared in the royal household where he learned ‘all the wisdom of theEgyptians’ – and became an adept in sorcery, and almost certainly a HighPriest.123 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts123]5 At the age of forty,124 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts124]according to the Bible, he heard that his own native people – the Israelites –were being oppressed by the Egyptians. Accordingly he left the court and went tofind out what was happening to them. He discovered that they were living a lifeof bondage, forced to do hard labour day and night. Incensed at this crueltreatment, and at the arrogance of the Egyptians, he lost his temper, killed anoverseer and then fled into exile.125[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts125]6 At the age of eighty126 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts126] – i.e.forty years later – he returned from exile to lead the Israelites out of theircaptivity.What happened during the missing forty years? The Bible is singularly unhelpfulin answering this question, devoting just eleven verses to direct discussion ofthe entire period.127 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts127] It does,however, make one thing abundantly clear: in all this great expanse of time thekey event was Moses’s encounter with Yahweh at the burning bush – an encounterthat took place at the foot of Mount Sinai where, some time later, the Ark ofthe Covenant was to be built.Long before Moses persuaded the Israelites to follow him across the Red Sea, isit not therefore probable that he had thoroughly familiarized himself with thefearsome wildernesses of the Sinai peninsula? The location of the burning bushincident leaves no room for doubt that he spent at least part of his forty-yearexile in these remote and mountainous deserts. Indeed, it is even possible thathe passed most or all of this period there – a view for which there is a degreeof academic support. According to one learned Egyptologist, Moses could havespent as long as a quarter of a century in Sinai, living in a settlement on amountain known as Serabit-el-Khadem barely fifty miles from Mount Sinaiitself.128 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts128]In June 1989 I visited and climbed Serabit-el-Khadem, which stands in theaustere and barren highlands of southern-central Sinai. On the flat top of themountain, completely innocent of tourists, were the ruins of the settlement inwhich Moses was thought to have lived – ruins dominated by the obelisks, altarsand graceful columns of what must once have been an extensive Egyptian temple.As a High Priest of the ancient Egyptian religion, I reasoned, Moses would havefelt comfortable here – and if he had indeed fled the wrath of Pharaoh afterkilling an overseer as the Bible claimed, then he would have been relativelysafe in this remote and obscure spot.I decided to find out more about Serabit-el-Khadem and researched it in somedepth after my initial visit. In the course of this work, two significant factscame to light.First, I learned that the temple site which I had seen had been thoroughlyinvestigated in 1904–5 by the great British archaeologist Sir William FlindersPetrie – and that he had unearthed fragments of several stone tablets there.129[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts129] These tablets were inscribedwith writing in a strange pictographic alphabet that, much later, was proved tohave belonged to a Semitic-Canaanite language related to ancient Hebrew.130[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts130]Second, I discovered that the settlement at Serabit-el-Khadem had been animportant centre for the mining and manufacture of copper and turquoise fromroughly 1990 BC until 1190 BC.131[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts131] These dates meant that there wasno anachronism in the assumption that Moses might have sojourned here in thethirteenth century BC, just prior to the Exodus. And the evidence that analphabet related to Hebrew had been in use on the site at about the same timelooked like further corroboration of this view. What really interested me,however, was the point emphasized above, namely that Serabit had functioned as asort of industrial and metallurgical complex and that the whole area had beenextensively mined. It seemed to me that if Moses had indeed lived here for alengthy period then he could hardly have failed to acquire knowledge of theminerals and metal ores of southern Sinai.After my visit to Serabit-el-Khadem in June 1989 I drove my hired Jeep the fiftymiles across the desert to Mount Sinai. In a sense the word ‘desert’ is amisnomer for this region, for although there are sandy expanses, the bulk of thecountryside consists of steep and withered mountain ranges, red in colour, uponwhich almost nothing grows. The only patches of greenery are created byoccasional oases in the valleys, and one such oasis, rich in date palms, standsat the foot of Mount Sinai. Here, in the fourth century AD, a small Christianchapel was erected on the supposed site of the burning bush. That chapel wasgreatly extended in subsequent years. By the fifth century it had become asubstantial monastery under the patronage of the Coptic Church of Alexandria. Inthe sixth century the Roman Emperor Justinian massively fortified themonastery’s walls so that it could better withstand the attacks of maraudingbedouin tribes. Finally, in the eleventh century, the whole complex wasdedicated to Saint Catherine.132 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts132]It continues to be known as ‘Saint Catherine’s’ today, and many of thestructures built in the fifth and sixth centuries still stand.Before embarking on the arduous 7,450-foot climb to the top of Mount Sinai Ispent some time inside the ancient monastery. The main church contained severalremarkable icons, mosaics and paintings, some of them almost 1,500 years old. Inthe gardens was a walled enclosure built around a large raspberry bush that wasbelieved by the monks to be the original burning bush.133[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts133] This it certainly was not – and,indeed, I was well aware that even Mount Sinai’s claim to be the ‘Mount Sinai’referred to in the Bible had by no means been conclusively proved. The fact was,however, that monastic traditions dating back at least to the fourth century ADhad associated this particular peak with the ‘mountain of God,’ and had almostcertainly done so on the basis of reliable sources of information now lost.134[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts134] Moreover I knew that localtribal traditions concurred: the bedouin name for Mount Sinai was simply JebelMusa – ‘the mountain of Moses’.135[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts135] Scholarly opinion alsoassociated the biblical Mount Sinai with the peak bearing that name today – andthe few dissenting voices did not favour a different region but rather othernearby peaks in the same range (for example Jebel Serbal).136[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts136]I must confess that after climbing Mount Sinai in June 19891 was left in nodoubt that this had indeed been the mountain to which Moses had brought theIsraelites ‘in the third month’ after leaving Egypt. Pausing at the summit, Istood on a ledge which overlooked tumbled miles of worn and jagged uplandsdescending to sere plains in the far distance. There was a haze and apowder-blue stillness in the air – not silence, exactly, but stillness. Then asudden wind whipped up, cool and dry at that altitude, and I watched an eaglesoar heavenwards on a thermal, gliding briefly level with me before itdisappeared from sight. I remained there alone for a while, in that pitiless anduncompromising place, and I remember thinking that Moses could hardly havechosen a more dramatic or a more appropriate location in which to receive theTen Commandments from the hand of God.But is that really what the Hebrew magus came to Mount Sinai to do? It seems tome that there is an alternative scenario. Could it not be that his true purposeall along had been to build the Ark of the Covenant and to place inside it somegreat energy source, the raw substance of which he had known that he would beable to find on this particular mountain top?This is a highly speculative thesis – but it is speculation that we areindulging in here and there is room for a little imaginative licence. If Moseshad known of the existence of some potent substance on the peak of Mount Sinai,then what might that substance have been?One suggestion – put forward in a different context in Chapter 3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c03_r1.htm] – is that the tablets of stone on which Godsupposedly wrote the Ten Commandments were in fact two pieces of a meteorite.Resonant with echoes of Wolfram’s Grail Stone (described as having been broughtdown from heaven by a troop of angels137[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts137]), this intriguing possibility istaken seriously by several top-flight biblical scholars, who point to theworship of meteoric fragments in a number of ancient Semitic cultures138[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts138] and add that:concealing tables of law within a closed container [seems] somewhat odd … Wordsof law engraved upon stone were surely meant to be publicly displayed … [it maytherefore be] supposed that the Ark held not two tables of the law but a fetishstone, a meteorite from Mount Sinai.139[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts139]If this conjecture is correct then the field lies open to guess what elementexactly the ‘meteorite from Mount Sinai’ might have consisted of. It is at anyrate not beyond the bounds of reason to suppose that it might have beenradioactive, or that it might have possessed some chemical characteristic thatwould have made it useful to Moses if his purpose had really been to manufacturea potent and durable source of energy for installation in the Ark.The notion that he might have been manufacturing something on Mount Sinai iscertainly not ruled out by the Scriptures. On the contrary, many passages in therelevant chapters of the book of Exodus are sufficiently peculiar and puzzlingto allow just such an interpretation to be put on them.The so-called ‘theophany’ – the manifestation of a deity to a mortal man – beganimmediately after the Israelites had ‘camped before the mount’. Then ‘Moses wentup unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain.’140[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts140]At this early stage the Bible makes no mention of smoke or fire or any of theother special effects that were soon to be brought into play. Instead theprophet simply climbed the mountain and held a private conversation with Yahweh,a conversation that was not witnessed by anyone else. Significantly, one of thefirst instructions that he supposedly received from the deity was this:Thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed toyourselves that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: Whoevertouches the mountain will be put to death … He must be stoned or shot down byarrow … he must not remain alive.141[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts141]It goes almost without saying that Moses would have had a strong reason toimpose just such a rigorous and ‘divinely ordained’ exclusion zone if he hadindeed been planning to manufacture or process some substance on Mount Sinai:the prospect of being stoned or shot would certainly have deterred the curiousfrom venturing up to see what he was really doing there and thus would haveenabled him to preserve the illusion that he was meeting with God.At any rate, it was only after he had spent three days on the mountain that thedrama really began. Then:In the morning … there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon themount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people thatwas in the camp trembled … And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, becauseYahweh had descended on it in the form of fire. Like smoke from a furnace thesmoke went up.142 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts142]Initially it seems that Moses spent only part of his time isolated on the peak,and that he was frequently in the camp. Soon, however, God told him this:Come up to me on the mountain and stay there while I give you the stone tablets– the law and the commandments – which I have written.143[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts143]This, then, was the prelude to what was to be the key event on Sinai – Moses’sacquisition of the two tablets of stone that he would later place inside the Arkof the Covenant. The prophet’s ascent was accompanied by further specialeffects:Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory ofYahweh settled upon mount Sinai; for six days the cloud covered it, and on theseventh day Yahweh called to Moses from inside the cloud. To the eyes of thesons of Israel the glory of Yahweh seemed like a devouring fire on the mountaintop. Moses went right into the cloud. He went up the mountain and stayed therefor forty days and forty nights.144[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts144]Would an omnipotent God have required forty days and forty nights to deliver twostone tablets to His prophet? Such a lengthy period seems hardly necessary. If,however, Moses had not been receiving ‘the tablets of the Testimony’ at all, butinstead had been manufacturing or refining some compact stone-like energy sourceto place inside the Ark, then he could well have needed that much time to finishthe work.From this perspective, the ‘devouring fire’ on the mountain top that theIsraelites had interpreted as ‘the glory of Yahweh’ would really have been theinfernal glow given off by whatever devices or chemical processes the prophetwas using to achieve his objective. And although this hypothesis soundsfar-fetched, it is surely not more so than the strange information concerningthe tablets of stone that is contained in the Old Testament, in the Mishnah, inthe Midrash, in the Talmud, and in the most archaic Jewish legends.TABLETS OF STONE?The clearest descriptions of the tablets are contained in the Talmudic-Midrashicsources which yield the following information: (1) they were ‘made of asapphire-like stone’; (2) they were ‘not more than six hands in length and asmuch in width’ but were nevertheless enormously heavy; (3) though hard they werealso flexible; (4) they were transparent.145[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts145]It was upon these peculiar objects that the Ten Commandments were supposedlywritten – by no lesser figure than Yahweh Himself, as the Bible is at pains topoint out:When He had finished speaking with Moses on the mountain of Sinai, He gave himthe two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, inscribed by the finger ofGod … And Moses turned and went down from the mount with the two tablets of theTestimony in his hands, tablets inscribed on both sides, inscribed on the frontand on the back. These tablets were the work of God, and the writing on them wasGod’s writing.146 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts146]Theologically, therefore, there can be no doubting the sanctity or thesignificance of the prophet’s burden: written upon by the very finger of God,the two tablets were quite literally fragments of the divine. From the biblicalviewpoint nothing more precious had ever been entrusted to mortal man. One wouldhave thought that Moses would have looked after them. He did not do so, however.Instead, in a fit of pique, he broke these pure and perfect gifts.Why did he do this incomprehensible thing? According to the explanation given inExodus it was because the perfidious Israelites had lost hope that he would everreturn after his forty days on the mountain and had fashioned a golden calf,which they were worshipping. Arriving in the camp Moses then caught them inflagrante delicto offering sacrifices and dancing and prostrating themselvesbefore the idol. At the sight of this grotesque apostasy the prophet’s ‘angerwaxed hot and he threw down the tablets that he was holding and broke them atthe foot of the mountain.’147 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts147] Hethen disposed of the golden calf, had about three thousand of the worstidolators executed, and restored order.148[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts148]So much, then, for the official account of how and why the original tablets ofstone came to be broken. These items, however, were clearly of vital importanceand had to be replaced. Accordingly God instructed Moses to return to themountain top to receive two new tablets. The prophet complied and ‘stayed therewith Yahweh forty days and forty nights … and he inscribed on the tablets thewords of the Covenant, the Ten Commandments.’149[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts149] Moses then climbed down themountain again bearing the tablets, exactly as he had done before. A close studyof the relevant biblical passages, however, does reveal a single substantive andsignificant difference between his two descents: on the second occasion ‘theskin of his face shone’;150 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts150] onthe first there had been no mention of this odd phenomenon.What could have caused the prophet’s face to shine? The biblical scribesnaturally assumed that it had been his proximity to God, and explained: ‘theskin on his face was radiant after speaking with Yahweh.’151[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts151] Yet on several previousoccasions, dating back as far as the burning bush, Moses had stood close toYahweh and had not suffered any such consequences. Indeed, a typical example hadoccurred just before he had embarked on his second forty-day expedition toSinai. While still in the Israelite camp he had participated in a lengthy andintimate encounter with the deity, an encounter that had been held in aspecially sanctified structure called the ‘Tent of Meeting’.152[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts152] There ‘the Lord spake unto Mosesface to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend,’153[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts153] but there was no hint orsuggestion that the prophet’s skin had glowed as a result.So what could have produced this effect? Is it not reasonable to suggest that itmight have been the tablets of stone themselves? Oblique corroboration forprecisely this suggestion exists in the Talmudic and Midrashic sources whichinsist that the tablets had been infused with ‘Divine radiance’. When God handedthem to Moses: ‘He seized them by the top third, whereas Moses took hold of thebottom third, but one third remained open, and it was in this way that theDivine radiance was shed upon Moses’ face.’154[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts154]Since this did not happen with the first set of tablets – the ones that Mosesbroke – it is legitimate to ask a question: why were things so different thesecond time around? Could the answer possibly be that Moses had discovered thatthe first set of tablets were technically imperfect as an energy sourceprecisely because they didn’t burn his face? This would explain why he brokethem. He did, however, sustain burns from the second set. Perhaps this proved tohim that whatever process he had used to manufacture them had worked – and madehim confident that they would function properly when they were placed inside theArk.The idea that the glow or shine on Moses’s skin might in fact have been causedby some sort of burn is of course purely speculative. There is no support for itin the Bible. Nevertheless, it seems to me to be a perfectly reasonablededuction – as reasonable as any other – from the small amount of evidence thatis available there. The description of the prophet’s descent from the mountainwith the second set of tablets is limited to just seven verses in Chapter 34 ofExodus.155 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts155] These verses,however, make it absolutely clear that his appearance was so gruesome when hearrived in the camp that all the Israelites were ‘afraid to come nigh him’.156[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts156] To spare their feelings ‘he puta veil over his face’157 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts157] – andever afterwards, except when he was alone in his tent, he wore this veil.158[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts158]Does this not sound much less like the behaviour of a man who had been touchedby the radiance of God than of a man burned – and burned badly – by some potentenergy source?A TESTAMENT TO LOST TRUTHSIt would be possible to speculate endlessly about the true character of the Arkof the Covenant – and of its contents. I have gone as far as I wish to down thisparticular road. Readers who would like to go further, however, might find itinteresting to consider first the materials from which the Ark was made. Hugequantities of gold seem to have been used – and gold, as well as being beautifuland noble, is also chemically non-reactive and exceptionally dense. Inparticular the ‘mercy seat’ – which served as the lid of the relic – wasbelieved by one learned rabbi (who lived in the twelfth century AD) to have beena full hand-breadth thick.159 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts159]Since a hand-breadth was traditionally measured from the tip of the thumb to theextended tip of the little finger, this means that the Ark was closed with ahulking slab of solid gold nine inches deep.160[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts160] Why was it necessary to use somuch of the precious metal? And was it an accident that Rabbi Shelomo Yitshakiwho procured this information – as well as a great deal of other intelligenceconcerning the sacred relic – was born and spent most of his life in the city ofTroyes in the heart of France’s Champagne region?161[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts161] That same city was the home ofChrétien de Troyes whose work on the Holy Grail, written seventy-five yearsafter the rabbi’s death, established the genre in which Wolfram von Eschenbachwas soon to follow. And it was in Troyes as well that the rule of the KnightsTemplar was drawn up by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. In this way the mysteriesand the connections multiply.Those who are curious might also wish to give some thought to the peculiargarments that the High Priests of ancient Israel wore when they approached theArk.162 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts162] If they did not wearthese garments their lives were believed to be at risk.163[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts163] Was this purely a matter ofsuperstition and ritual? Or was protective clothing necessary for some reasonthat perhaps had to do with the nature of the Ark itself?Related to this point is another – the curious coverings, consisting of twolayers of cloth and one of leather, that the Ark had to be wrapped in before itcould be transported164 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts164](apparently in order to prevent anyone from being killed as a result ofaccidentally touching it whilst it was on the move165[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts165]). Even when these precautionshad been fully complied with, however, the sacred relic still sometimes causedthe death of its bearers. It did so with ‘sparks’.166[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts166] But what were these sparks? Andwere the wrappings – which were all made of non-conductive materials167[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts167] – perhaps intended to serve asinsulation?168 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts168]Also of some potential interest is the story of Nadab and Abihu, the two sons ofAaron who were struck down by the Ark soon after its installation in theTabernacle (I have described this incident briefly in Chapter 12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm]; according to the Scriptures a flame leaptout at them ‘and devoured them and they died’169[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts169]). Surprisingly, Moses completelyignored the normally lengthy Hebrew funeral procedures and instead ordered thatthe bodies should immediately be taken ‘far away’ out of the camp.170[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts170] Why should he have done such athing? What was it exactly that he feared?Moving forward in time, I suggest that those who wish to learn more could doworse than examine the passages in the Bible which recount the dreadfulafflictions that the Ark worked amongst the Philistines during the seven monthsthat it spent in their hands after they had captured it at the battle ofEbenezer.171 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts171] Again, I havedescribed these events in Chapter 12 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm], but Ihave also left much unsaid that could be said.Many riddles, too, might be solved by a close study of what happened in theyears after the Ark was returned to the Israelites by the Philistines and beforeKing Solomon finally installed it in the Holy of Holies of his Temple inJerusalem. I believe that an explanation exists for the miracles and the terrorsthat it worked during this period172[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts172] – a rational explanationconnected to its character as a man-made device and not to any divine orunearthly influences.Indeed, my own investigations have led me to conclude that it may only bepossible to understand the sacred relic properly when it is seen in this light –not as a repository of supernatural powers but as an artefact and as aninstrument. No doubt this instrument was very different from any known to ustoday, but it was none the less the product of human ingenuity, devised by humanhands to fulfil very human objectives. As such its magic and its mystery are notdiminished for me. The gift of an ancient and secret science, I think of it as akey to the sealed and unremembered history of our species, a sign of ourforgotten glory, and a testament to lost truths about ourselves.And what else is the quest for the Ark or the Grail if it is not a quest forknowledge, a quest for wisdom and a quest for enlightenment?"},{"pageContent":"PART V: ISRAEL AND EGYPT, 1990WHERE IS THE GLORY?"},{"pageContent":"[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_m05_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14THE GLORY IS DEPARTED FROM ISRAELIn the mid-afternoon of Thursday 4 October 19901 entered the old walled city ofJerusalem through the Jaffa Gate. After passing Omar Ibn el-Khatab Square, withits pleasant cafés and hawkers’ stands, a bewildering maze of narrow streetspaved with ancient cobble stones lay ahead of me.A few years earlier this whole area would have been seething with shoppers andsightseers; now, however, it was almost deserted. The Palestinian intifada, andrecent threats by Iraq to ‘burn’ Israel with Scud missiles, had been enough todrive virtually all foreigners away.To my right, as I walked, was the Armenian Quarter and, to my left, theChristian Quarter dominated by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Within thisgreat edifice was the Chapel of the Invention of the Cross which the victoriousMuslim general Saladin – at the request of King Lalibela – had granted to theEthiopian community of Jerusalem after the Crusaders had been expelled from thecity in AD 1187.1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts1] In later yearsthe Ethiopians had lost their privileges in the chapel. I knew, however, thatthey still occupied an extensive monastery on its roof.I continued in an easterly direction through the silent and deserted alleys,many of which were covered with canvas awnings that cut out the glare and heatof the afternoon sun, creating a cool, almost subterranean atmosphere. A fewforlorn shopkeepers sitting in their doorways made half-hearted attempts to sellme souvenirs that I did not want and bags of ripe oranges that I had no desireto carry.To my right now, as I proceeded along the Street of the Chain, was the JewishQuarter where gangs of Hasidic youths dressed in dark suits and incongruous furhats roamed pugnaciously about, declaring by their body language that they werethe masters of all they surveyed. To my left, filled to the brim withunhappiness, frustration and restless despair, was the Muslim Quarter. Andstraight ahead, rising up above the clutter of the old city like a golden symbolof hope, was the Dome of the Rock – the beautiful mosque erected by the CaliphOmar and his successors in the seventh century AD and regarded as the third mostsacred place in the Islamic world.2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts2]It was the Dome of the Rock that I had come to see, although not because of itssignificance to Muslims but because it had been built on the original site ofthe Temple of Solomon. Inside I knew that I would find a great stone, believedby orthodox Jews to be the Shetiyyah – the foundation-stone of the world. And onthat stone, in the tenth century BC, amidst the ‘thick darkness’ of the Holy ofHolies, the Ark of the Covenant had been placed by Solomon himself.3[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts3] Like a man who seeks to conjureup an image of his long-departed lover by caressing some item of her clothing, Itherefore hoped that by touching the Shetiyyah I might gain a deeper and moreabiding sense of the lost relic that I sought.This, however, was not my only purpose on that afternoon in October. Just a fewhundred metres to the south of the Dome of the Rock I knew that I would also beable to visit another building of central importance to my quest – the Al-AqsaMosque, which the Knights Templar had used as their headquarters in the twelfthcentury AD. From this base, I suspected, they had sallied forth to conductinvestigations of their own in the caverns beneath the Shetiyyah – where certainlegends suggested that the Ark had been concealed shortly before the destructionof Solomon’s Temple.4 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts4]It was to the Al-Aqsa Mosque that I went first, slipping off my shoes andentering the cool and roomy rectangular hall believed by Muslims to be the‘furthermost sanctuary’, to which Muhammad was supposedly transported by angelson his famous Night Journey. Whatever place of prayer existed in the Prophet’slifetime (AD 570–632) had long since vanished, however, and I was confronted bya medley of different building styles, the oldest of which dated back to aroundAD 1035 and the most recent to the period 1938–42, when the Italian dictatorMussolini had donated the forest of marble columns that lay ahead of me and whenKing Farouk of Egypt had financed the restoration and repainting of theceiling.5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts5]The Templars, too, had left their mark on the great mosque. Taking up residencehere in AD 1119 and not leaving until 1187 when they were driven out ofJerusalem by Saladin, they had been responsible, amongst other things, for thethree magnificent central bays of the porch. Much of the other architecture thatthe knights had added had subsequently been destroyed. Their refectory, however,had survived (being incorporated into the nearby Women’s Mosque), and the vastunderground area which they had developed as stables for their horses (theso-called ‘Stables of Solomon’) were also in a good state of repair.6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts6]As I carefully picked my way in stockinged feet amongst the Muslims who werealready assembling for afternoon prayer I felt strangely light-headed but at thesame time alert – keyed-up. The jumble of different eras and influences, the oldmixed in with the new, Mussolini’s marble columns, and the eleventh-centuryIslamic mosaics, had all conspired to confuse my perceptions. Currents ofincense-laden air wafted through the spacious and light-filled interior,summoning up visions of the European knights who had lived and died here so longago and who had named their strange and secretive order after the Temple ofSolomon – the site of which, now occupied by the Dome of the Rock, was only twominutes’ walk away.The raison d’être of the Temple had been extremely simple. It had been conceivedand designed as nothing more, and nothing less, than ‘an house of rest for theArk of the Covenant of the Lord’.7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts7] But the Ark, of course, had longsince vanished, and the Temple, too, was gone. Utterly and completely destroyedby the Babylonians in 587 BC, the structure erected by Solomon had been replacedhalf a century later by the Second Temple – which, in its turn, had been razedby the Romans in AD 70. The site had then lapsed into disuse until the arrivalof the Muslim armies in AD 638 when the Dome of the Rock had been built.8[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts8] Throughout all these changes theShetiyyah had remained in place. The sacred floor on which the Ark had oncestood was therefore the single constant factor that had weathered all the stormsof history, that had seen Jews and Babylonians and Romans and Christians andMuslims come and go, and that still endured today.Leaving the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and slipping on my shoes again, I now made my way upthrough the tree-lined precincts of the Temple Mount to the Dome of the Rock –the very name of which reflected its guardianship of the Shetiyyah. A large andelegant octagonal building faced with rich blue tiling, its dominant exteriorfeature was its massive golden dome (which, indeed, could be seen from manydifferent parts of Jerusalem). To my eye, however, there was nothingoverwhelming about this tall and perfect monument. On the contrary it conveyed acomplex feeling of lightness and grace coupled with an understated butreassuring strength.This first impression was enhanced and completed by the interior of thebuilding, which quite literally took my breath away. The soaring ceiling, thecolumns and arches supporting the inner octagon, the various niches andrecesses, the mosaics, the inscriptions – all these elements and many moremelded together in a sublime harmony of proportion and design that gave eloquentexpression to humanity’s yearning for the divine and that proclaimed thatyearning to be both noble and profound.My glance had been drawn upwards when I entered – upwards into the cupola, thefarthest reaches of which were lost in the cool darkness overhead. Now, however,as though attracted by some powerful magnetic force, I felt my attention tuggeddown again towards the very centre of the mosque where a huge tawny rock perhapsthirty feet across, flat in places, jagged in others, lay directly beneath thedome.This was the Shetiyyah and, as I approached it, I was aware that my heart wasbeating more quickly than usual and that my breathing seemed laboured. It wasnot difficult to understand why the ancients had thought of this great boulderas the foundation-stone of the world or to see why Solomon had chosen it as thecentrepiece of his Temple. Rough-textured and asymmetrical, it jutted out abovethe bedrock of Mount Moriah as solid and as unshakable as the earth itself.A carved wooden railing surrounded the whole central area, but into one cornerof this railing was set a shrine through which I was allowed to push my hand totouch the Shetiyyah. Its texture, smoothed down by the caresses of countlessgenerations of pilgrims before me, was slick, almost glasslike, and I stoodthere, lost in my own thoughts, drinking in through the pores of my fingers theimmense antiquity of this strange and wonderful stone. Though it was perhaps asmall victory, it nevertheless meant a great deal to me to be in this place andto savour this moment of quiet reflection at the source of the mystery that Isought to solve.Eventually I withdrew my hand and continued my circuit of the Shetiyyah. At oneside a stairway led down to a deep hollow beneath the stone – a cave-like cistknown to the Muslims as Bir el-Arweh, the ‘Well of Souls’. Here, according tothe faithful, the voices of the dead could sometimes be heard mingled with thesounds of the rivers of paradise. As I entered, however, I could hear nothingexcept the murmured prayers of the half-dozen or so pilgrims who had preceded meand who were now slumped in obeisance on the cold rock floor invoking inmellifluous Arabic the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful – a deitywhose prophets, long before the time of Muhammad, had included Abraham and Mosesand who, in his absolute and uncompromising oneness, was in no way differentfrom Yahweh, the God of the Ark.9 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts9]I already knew that a number of Jewish and Islamic legends spoke of a sealed andsecret passage beneath the Well of Souls leading into the bowels of the earth,where the Ark had supposedly been concealed at the time of the destruction ofSolomon’s Temple – and where many believed that it rested still, guarded byspirits and demons.10 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts10] As notedin Part II [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_p02_r1.htm], I suspected that the KnightsTemplar could have been motivated to search here for the Ark in the twelfthcentury AD after learning of these legends. One variant of the tale that mightparticularly have excited their interest purported to be an eyewitness accountby a certain ‘Baruch’ of an intervention by an ‘angel of the Lord’ only momentsbefore the Babylonian army broke into the Temple:And I saw him descend into the Holy of Holies, and take from it the veil, andthe Holy Ark, and its cover, and the two tablets … And he cried to the earth ina loud voice, ‘Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the mighty God, and receivewhat I commit to you, and guard them until the last times, so that, when you areordered, you may restore them, and strangers may not get possession of them …’And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up.11[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts11]If the Templars had indeed been inspired by this text to search beneath the Wellof Souls they would not, I was absolutely confident, have found the Ark there.The so-called ‘Apocalypse of Baruch’ (from which the above quotation is taken)might easily have seemed to them like a genuinely ancient document dating fromthe sixth century BC. The truth, however, as modern scholarship had subsequentlyrevealed, was that it was written in the late first century AD and that ittherefore could not possibly have been an eyewitness account of the concealmentof the sacred relic, whether by an angel or by any other agency. On the contraryit was, from beginning to end, a work of imaginative fiction which, despite itseerie and evocative tone, possessed no historical merit whatsoever.12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts12]For this and other reasons, I felt sure that the Templars would have beenfrustrated in their excavations beneath the Temple Mount. But I also suspectedthat they had later learned of Ethiopia’s claim to be the last resting place ofthe Ark and that a group of knights had ultimately gone there to investigatethis claim for themselves.13 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts13]I, too, was following the same trail that those knights had stumbled upon somany centuries before, and I felt that it pointed compellingly towards thesanctuary chapel in the sacred city of Axum. Before attempting to make my ownway into the war-torn highlands of Tigray, however, I wanted to be absolutelysatisfied that there was no other country or place where the lost relic couldbe. It was that desire that had brought me to the original site of the Temple ofSolomon on 4 October 1990. And it was that desire that had drawn me to theShetiyyah, on which the Ark had once stood and from which it had vanished.That was my starting point, but now I intended to use the rest of my stay inJerusalem to talk to religious and academic authorities and to examine in thegreatest possible depth all the circumstances known to have surrounded themysterious disappearance of the relic. Only if I was still confident of thebasic merit of the Ethiopian claim after I had completed that exercise would Ifinally commit myself to the Axum adventure. The January 1991 Timkat ceremonialsat which I hoped that the object believed to be the Ark would be carried inprocession were, however, less than four months away. I was therefore acutelyaware that my time was running out.WHAT HOUSE CAN YOU BUILD ME?The installation of the Ark in the Temple of Solomon, which – as I had alreadyestablished – must have taken place around the year 955 BC,14[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts14] was described in the first bookof Kings:Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel … And the priests brought in the Arkof the Covenant of the Lord to its place in the Temple … in the Holy ofHolies … And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place,that the cloud filled the house of the Lord, so that the priests could not standto minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the houseof the Lord. Then spake Solomon, ‘The Lord said that he would dwell in the thickdarkness. I have surely built thee a house to dwell in,, a settled place forthee to abide in forever … But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, theheaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house thatI have builded?’15 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts15]According to the Scriptures, Solomon had later ‘turned away his heart afterother gods’ and had worshipped with particular enthusiasm ‘Ashtoreth the goddessof the Zidonians and … Milcom the abomination of the Amorites’.16[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts16] Because of this tendency toapostasy I found it difficult to believe that the monarch whose legendary wisdomwas said to have excelled ‘all the wisdom of Egypt’17[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts17] had ever really held Yahweh inespecially high esteem. And for the same reason I did not think that he had beenpaying metaphysical tribute to the omnipotence and omnipresence of the God ofIsrael when he had expressed his doubts about the ability of the Temple to‘contain’ the Ark. On the contrary, it seemed to me that when Solomon haduttered these curious words he had been giving voice to genuine fears of apragmatic rather than of a spiritual nature. Might not the sacred relic stillbreak free, even though it was anchored now to the very foundation-stone of theworld? Might not the unpredictable energies pent up within it still besufficiently potent and dangerous to burn through the thick darkness of the Holyof Holies and to destroy the great ‘house’ that had been erected around it?There was, I felt, a real sense in which the Temple appeared to have been builtless as an earthly palace for a dearly beloved but incorporeal deity than as akind of prison for the Ark of the Covenant. Within the Holy of Holies, above thetwo cherubim that faced each other across the relic’s golden lid, Solomon hadinstalled two additional cherubim of giant size – grim guardians indeed, withwingspans of fifteen feet or more, all covered in gold.18[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts18] Meanwhile the Holy of Holiesitself – the purpose of which, the Bible stated explicitly, had been ‘to containthe Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh’19[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts19] – had been a perfect cube,foursquare and immensely strong. Measuring thirty feet long, by thirty feetwide, by thirty feet high,20 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts20] itsfloor, its four walls and its ceiling had been lined with pure gold, weighing anestimated 45,000 pounds,21 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts21] andriveted with golden nails.22 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts22]Nor was this golden cell the only feature of the Temple’s construction thatcaught my attention. At least as interesting was the pedigree of the craftsman –a foreigner – who had been called in to complete all the other metalwork thatSolomon had required:And Solomon sent for Hiram of Tyre; he was the son of a widow of the tribe ofNaphtali … and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to workall works in bronze.23 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts23]The phrase emphasized above in italics had jumped out at me from the page assoon as I had set eyes upon it. Why? Because I knew that the very first mentionin literature of the Grail hero Parzival had described him in almost exactly thesame words as ‘the son of the widowed lady’.24[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts24] Indeed, both Chrétien de Troyes,the founder of the genre, and his successor Wolfram von Eschenbach, had gone togreat lengths to make it clear that Parzival’s mother had been a widow.25[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts25]Could I be looking, I wondered, at yet another of the bizarre coincidences inwhich, through the use of dense and often deceptive symbolism, the fictionalquest for the Holy Grail seemed to have been deliberately devised to serve as acryptogram for the real quest for the lost Ark? I had long since satisfiedmyself that the Knights Templar had been key players in both and that, after thedestruction of their order in the fourteenth century, many of their traditionshad been preserved in Freemasonry. I was therefore intrigued to learn that Hiramof Tyre, who the Bible said had been called to Jerusalem by Solomon, was notonly a widow’s son like Parzival, but also a figure of immense significance toFreemasons – who knew him as ‘Hiram Abiff’, and who made reference to him in alltheir most important rituals.26 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts26]According to Masonic tradition Hiram was murdered by three of his assistantssoon after he had completed the bronzework of the Temple. And this event was forsome reason regarded as so laden with meaning that it was commemorated in theinitiation ceremonies for Master Masons – in which each initiate was required toplay the role of the murder victim. In one authoritative study I found thisdescription of the relevant part of the ceremonial (which is still in regularuse today):Blindfolded on the ground, the initiate hears the three murderers decide to buryhim in a pile of rubble until ‘low twelve’ (midnight), when they will carry thebody away from the Temple. To symbolise the burial of Hiram Abiff, the candidateis wrapped in a blanket and carried to the side of the room. Soon he hears abell strike twelve times and is carried from the ‘rubble’ grave to a grave dugon the brow of a hill ‘west of Mount Moriah’ (the Temple Mount). He hears themurderers agree to mark his grave with a sprig of acacia, then set out to escapeto Ethiopia across the Red Sea.27[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts27]Here, then, were more coincidences – a minor one in the form of the sprig ofacacia (the same wood that was used to make the Ark), and a major one in theMasonic tradition that Hiram’s murderers had intended to flee ‘to Ethiopia’. Ihad no idea how much weight I should attach to such details but I could not ridmyself of the feeling that they must in some way be relevant to my quest.This suspicion deepened, furthermore, when I turned back to the Bible to findthat one of the bronze items of Temple furniture that Hiram was said to havebuilt wasthe Sea of cast metal, ten cubits from rim to rim, circular in shape and fivecubits high; a cord thirty cubits long gave the measurement of its girth … Itwas a handsbreadth in thickness, and its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup,like a flower. It held two thousand baths.28[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts28]This ‘Sea’, I learned, had stood in the courtyard of the Temple. It had been ahuge bronze basin, fifteen feet in diameter and seven and a half feet high. Ithad weighed around thirty tonnes when empty but had normally been kept full withan estimated 10,000 gallons of water.29[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts29] Most authorities admittedfrankly that they did not know what its function had been – although somethought that it had symbolized the ‘primordial waters’ referred to in the bookof Genesis30 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts30] and others believedthat it had been used by the priests for their ritual ablutions.31[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts31] I, however, found neither ofthese hypotheses satisfactory – and, of the two, the latter seemed the mostimprobable because the Bible stated quite plainly that Hiram had made tensmaller bronze basins for precisely this purpose (placed on wheeled stands, eachbasin held ‘forty baths’32 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts32]).After reviewing the evidence, therefore, I entered the following speculation inmy notebook:Is it not possible that the bronze ‘Sea’ which Hiram made for the courtyard ofSolomon’s Temple was a throwback to the ancient Egyptian rituals on which theceremonies of the Ark appear to have been closely modelled? In the festival ofApet at Luxor the ‘Arks’ containing effigies of the gods were always carried towater.33 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts33] And this, too, isprecisely what happens in Ethiopia today: at Timkat in Gondar the tabotat arecarried to the edge of a ‘sacred lake’ at the rear of the castle.34[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts34] So perhaps the bronze Sea wasalso a kind of sacred lake?According to the Bible, the other items fashioned by Hiram for Solomon’s Templehad included ‘the ash containers, the scoops and the sprinkling bowls’35[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts35] and alsotwo bronze pillars; the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a cordtwelve cubits long gave the measurement of its girth; so also was the secondpillar … He set up the pillars in front of the vestibule of the sanctuary; heset up the right-hand pillar and named it Jachin; he set up the left-hand pillarand named it Boaz. So the work on the pillars was completed.36[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts36]Jachin and Boaz, I discovered, also featured in Masonic traditions.37[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts37] According to the ‘old ritual’these two great pillars had been hollow. Inside them had been stored the‘ancient records’ and the ‘valuable writings’ pertaining to the past of theJewish people.38 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts38] And amongstthese records, the Freemasons claimed, had been ‘the secret of the magicalShamir and the history of its properties’.39[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts39]My curiosity was aroused by this mention of the ‘magical Shamir’. What had itbeen? Was it just a piece of Masonic arcana, or was it referred to in the Bible?After a painstaking search, I was able to confirm that the word ‘Shamir’appeared only four times in the Old and New Testaments40[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts40] – thrice as a place name andonce as the name of a man. Clearly, therefore, none of these could have been the‘magical’ Shamir, the secrets of which the Masons claimed had been concealed inHiram’s bronze pillars.I did find the information that I was looking for, however – not in theScriptures but in the Talmudic-Midrashic sources at my disposal. Because Moseshad commanded the Israelites not to use ‘any tool of iron’ in the constructionof holy places,41 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts41] Solomon hadordered that no hammers, axes or chisels should be used to cut and dress themany massive stone blocks from which the outer walls and courtyard of the Templehad been built. Instead he had provided the artificers with an ancient device,dating back to the time of Moses himself.42[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts42] This device was called theShamir and was capable of cutting the toughest of materials without friction orheat.43 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts43] Also known as ‘the stonethat splits rocks’,44 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts44]the Shamir may not be put in an iron vessel for safekeeping, nor in any metalvessel: it would burst such a receptacle asunder. It is kept wrapped up in awoollen cloth, and this in turn is placed in a lead basket filled with barleybran … With the destruction of the Temple the Shamir vanished.45[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts45]I was fascinated by this odd and ancient tradition, which also claimed that theShamir had possessed ‘the remarkable property of cutting the hardest ofdiamonds’.46 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts46] I then found acollateral version of the same story which added that it had been quitenoiseless while it was at work.47[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts47]All in all, I concluded, these characteristics (like many of the characteristicsof the Ark of the Covenant) sounded broadly technological in nature, rather thanin any way ‘magical’ or supernatural. And I also thought it significant thatthis peculiar device – again like the Ark – had been directly associated withMoses. Finally it did not seem to me entirely irrelevant that the Freemasons hadmaintained their own separate traditions about it – traditions which stated thatits secrets had been concealed inside the two bronze pillars placed ‘in front ofthe vestibule of the sanctuary’ by Hiram the widow’s son.Without knowledge of those long-lost ‘secrets’, I realized that I could not hopeto go any further with this line of inquiry. At the same time, however, I feltthat the story of the Shamir deepened the mystery surrounding the real nature ofthe great stronghold on the top of Mount Moriah that had been built andexplicitly dedicated as ‘an house of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of theLord’. With its bronze pillars and its bronze ‘Sea’, its giant cherubim and itsgolden inner shrine, Solomon’s Temple had clearly been a special place,wonderfully made, the focus of superstition and religious dread, and the centreof Jewish faith and cultural life. How, then, could the Ark possibly havedisappeared from it?SHISHAK, JEHOASH AND NEBUCHADNEZZARAn obvious answer to the last question – which, if correct, would completelyinvalidate the Ethiopian claim – was that the Ark could have been taken by forcefrom the Temple during one of the several military catastrophes that Israelsuffered after the death of Solomon.The first of these catastrophes occurred in 926 BC during the unsuccessful reignof Solomon’s son Rehoboam.48 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts48]Then, according to the first book of Kings, an Egyptian Pharaoh known asSheshonq (or ‘Shishak’) mounted a full-scale invasion:In the fifth year of king Rehoboam … Shishak king of Egypt came up againstJerusalem: And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and thetreasures of the king’s house; he even took away all.49[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts49]There was nothing in this tantalizingly brief account to suggest that Shishak’sbooty had not included the Ark of the Covenant. But if the Ark had indeed beencaptured just thirty years after Solomon had installed it in the Temple then itseemed to me that the scribes would have said so – and would in addition havelamented the loss of the precious relic. They had not even mentioned it,however50 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts50] – which to my mindimplied one of two things: either the Ark had been secretly removed before thearrival of the Egyptian army (perhaps during the reign of Solomon himself asEthiopian tradition insisted); or it had remained in situ in the Holy of Holiesthroughout the invasion. But the notion that the Pharaoh could have taken itlooked most implausible.A further indication that this was so had been left by Shishak himself in theform of his vast triumphal relief at Karnak. I had already become quite familiarwith that relief during my various visits to Egypt and I felt sure that it hadmade no mention of the Ark of the Covenant or, for that matter, of any siege orpillage of Jerusalem.51 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts51] Onchecking further I was now able to confirm that this impression had beencorrect. One authoritative study stated unequivocally that the majority of thetowns and cities listed as having been sacked by Shishak had in fact been in thenorthern part of Israel:Jerusalem, target of Shishak’s campaign according to the Bible, is missing.Although the inscription is heavily damaged, it is certain that Jerusalem wasnot included because the list is arranged into geographical sequences whichallow no space for the name Jerusalem.52[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts52]What then could have happened at the holy city to explain the Scripturalassertion that Shishak had taken away ‘the treasures of the house of the Lord,and the treasures of the king’s house’?The academic consensus, I discovered, was that the Pharaoh had surroundedJerusalem but that he had never actually entered it; instead he had been ‘boughtoff with the treasures of Solomon’s temple and palace.’53[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts53] These treasures, moreover, couldnot possibly have included the Ark, even if it had still been there in 926 BC;instead they would have consisted of far less sacred items, mainly public androyal donations dedicated to Yahweh. Such items, normally quite precious andmade of silver and gold, were not stored in the Holy of Holies but rather in theouter precincts of the Temple in special treasuries that were always mentionedin the Old Testament conjointly with the treasuries of the king’s house.54[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts54] ‘Occasionally,’ as one leadingbiblical scholar put it,these treasuries were depleted either by foreign invaders or by the kingsthemselves when they were in need of funds. The treasuries thus constantlyoscillated between a state of affluence and want … The invasion of Shishak[had], therefore, nothing to do with the Temple sanctums, and it would beentirely inaccurate to associate [it] with the disappearance of the Ark.55[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts55]Precisely the same caution, I discovered, also applied to the next occasion onwhich the Temple had apparently been looted. This had happened at a time whenthe unified state that David and Solomon had forged had been split into twowarring kingdoms – ‘Judah’ in the south (which included Jerusalem) and ‘Israel’in the north. In 796 BC56 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts56]Jehoash, the monarch of the northern kingdom, joined battle at Bethshemesh withhis Judaean counterpart Amaziah:And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to theirtents. And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah … at Bethshemesh,and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem … And he took allthe gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of theLord, and in the treasuries of the king’s house.57[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts57]Once again, this pillage of the Temple had not involved the Holy of Holies orthe Ark of the Covenant. As one authority on the period explained:Jehoash did not even enter the Temple’s outer sanctum, certainly not the innerone … The phrase ‘the house of the Lord’ mentioned in connection withJehoash … is simply a shortened form of ‘the treasuries of the house of theLord’. This may be seen from the fact that the ‘treasuries of the king’s house’which are always contiguously mentioned with the ‘treasuries of the house of theLord’ are also mentioned.58 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts58]So much then for Shishak and Jehoash. The reason that neither of them hadclaimed to have taken the Ark, and the reason that neither had been reported bythe Bible to have done so, was now quite clear to me: they had got nowhere nearthe Holy of Holies in which the sacred relic had been kept and had helpedthemselves only to minor treasures of gold and silver.The same, however, could not be said for Jerusalem’s next and greatest invader,King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. He attacked and occupied the holy city not oncebut twice, and even on the first occasion, in 598 BC,59[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts59] it was clear that he hadpenetrated deeply into the Temple itself. The Bible described this disaster inthe following terms:The troops of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched on Jerusalem, and the citywas besieged. Nebuchadnezzar … himself came to attack the city while his troopswere besieging it. Then Jehoiachin king of Judah surrendered to the king ofBabylon, he, his mother, his officers, his nobles and his eunuchs, and the kingof Babylon took them prisoner. This was the eighth year of King Nebuchadnezzar.The latter carried off all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and thetreasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the golden furnishings thatSolomon king of Israel had made for the sanctuary of Yahweh.60[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts60]What had Nebuchadnezzar’s booty consisted of? I already knew that the ‘treasuresof the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king’s house’ could not haveincluded any truly sacred objects such as the Ark. As noted above, these phraseshad very specific and distinct meanings in the original Hebrew and referred onlyto dispensable items stored in the royal and priestly treasuries.More significant by far was the statement that the Babylonian monarch had ‘cutin pieces all the golden furnishings that Solomon king of Israel had made forthe sanctuary of Yahweh.’ The Hebrew word that the translators of the JerusalemBible had rendered as ‘sanctuary’ was, I discovered, hekal and its precisemeaning was ‘outer sanctum’.61 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts61]In trying to envisage its location I found it useful to recall the basic layoutof Ethiopian Orthodox churches which – as I had learned on my trip to Gondar inJanuary 1990 – exactly reflected the tripartite division of the Temple ofSolomon.62 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts62] By co-ordinating thismental picture with the best scholarly research on the subject I was able toconfirm beyond any shadow of a doubt that the hekal had corresponded to thek’eddest of Ethiopian churches.63[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts63] This meant that the ‘sanctuaryof Yahweh’ despoiled by Nebuchadnezzar had not been the Holy of Holies in whichthe Ark had stood but rather the antechamber to that sacred place. The Holy ofHolies itself – the inner sanctum – had been known in ancient Hebrew as thedebir and corresponded to the mak’das in which the tabotat were kept inEthiopian churches.64 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts64]If the Ark had still been in the Temple at the time of Nebuchadnezzar’s firstattack, therefore – and that, as it turned out, was a very big if – then it wascertain that the Babylonian king had not taken it. Instead he had contentedhimself with cutting ‘in pieces’ and carrying off the ‘golden furnishings’ thatSolomon had placed in the hekal.65[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts65] The other ‘furnishings’ that hadbeen looted by Nebuchadnezzar – and the list was quite specific – were asfollows:the lamp-stands, five on the right and five on the left in front of the debir,of pure gold; the floral work, the lamps, the extinguishers of gold; the basins,knives, sprinkling bowls, incense boats, censers, of pure gold; the door socketsfor the inner shrine – that is, the Holy of Holies – and for the hekal, ofgold.66 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts66]Of course, in this translation, the terms ‘inner shrine’, ‘debir’ and ‘Holy ofHolies’ were all used interchangeably to refer to the same sacred place – i.e.the place in which the Ark had been installed by Solomon so many centuriesbefore.67 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts67] Once I had satisfiedmyself that that was indeed the case, a single significant fact suddenly becameclear to me: while not looting the Holy of Holies, Nebuchadnezzar hadnonetheless removed its door-sockets. From this it was safe to deduce that thedoors had been taken off their hinges and that the Babylonian monarch – or thesoldiers who had carried out his orders – would thus have been able to lookright into the debir.I realized immediately that this was an important, indeed a crucial, finding.Gazing into the inner sanctum the Babylonians should immediately have been ableto see the two giant cherubim, overlaid with gold, that Solomon had placed assentinels over the Ark – and they should also have been able to see the Arkitself. Since they had shown no compunction in removing the gold from thefurnishings of the hekal it therefore had to be asked why they had notimmediately rushed into the debir to strip the far larger quantities of goldfrom its walls and from the cherubim, and why they had not taken the Ark asbooty.The Babylonians had demonstrated that they held the Jews – and their religion –in complete contempt.68 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts68] Therewas thus no mileage in assuming that they might have refrained from looting theHoly of Holies out of some sort of altruistic desire to spare the feelings ofthe vanquished. On the contrary all the evidence suggested that if they hadindeed been confronted by rich pickings like the Ark, and the gold overlay onthe walls and on the cherubim, then Nebuchadnezzar and his men wouldunhesitatingly have helped themselves to the lot.What made this even more probable was that it had been the normal practice ofthe Babylonians at this time to seize the principal idols or cult-objects of thepeoples they had conquered and to transport them back to Babylon to place intheir own temple before the statue of their god Marduk.69[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts69] The Ark would have been an idealcandidate for this sort of treatment. Yet it had not even been stripped of itsgold, let alone carried off intact. Indeed neither it nor the cherubim had beenmentioned at all.The logical conclusion [I wrote in my notebook] is that the Ark and thegold-covered cherubim were no longer in the debir in 598 BC when the firstBabylonian invasion took place – and, indeed, that the walls, floor and ceilingof the debir had also been stripped of their gold prior to that date. This wouldseem to lend at least prima facie support to the Ethiopian claim – since I havealready established that Shishak and Jehoash did not get their hands on the Ark,or on the other precious contents of the debir, and since they were the onlyprevious invaders to have acquired any sort of treasure from the Temple.Of course the Babylonian assault on Jerusalem in 598 BC had not been the lastthat Nebuchadnezzar would mount – and the conclusion that I had just scribbledin my notebook would be proved completely false if there were any evidence tosuggest that he had taken the Ark the second time that he sacked the holy city.After the successful operation of 598 BC he had installed a puppet king,Zedekiah, on the throne.70 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts70] This‘puppet’, however, turned out to have ideas of his own and, in 589 BC, herebelled against his Babylonian overlord.71[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts71]The response was instantaneous. Nebuchadnezzar marched on Jerusalem once againand laid siege to it, finally breaching its walls and overrunning it in lateJune or early July of the year 587 BC.72[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts72] Slightly less than a monthlater:73 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts73]Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard, an officer of the king of Babylon … burneddown the Temple of Yahweh, the royal palace and all the houses in Jerusalem.The … troops who accompanied the commander of the guard … broke up the bronzepillars from the Temple of Yahweh, the wheeled stands and the bronze Sea thatwere in the Temple of Yahweh, and took the bronze away to Babylon. They took theash containers, the scoops, the knives, the incense boats, and all the bronzefurnishings used in worship. The commander of the guard took the censers and thesprinkling bowls, everything that was made of gold and everything made ofsilver. As regards the two pillars, the one Sea and the wheeled stands … therewas no reckoning the weight in bronze in all these objects.74[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts74]This, then, was the detailed inventory offered in the Bible of all the objectsand treasures broken up or carried off to Babylon after Nebuchadnezzar’s secondattack on the city. Once again, and significantly, the Ark of the Covenant wasnot included – and nor was the gold that Solomon had used to line the Holy ofHolies and to overlay the great cherubim that had stood within that sacredplace. Indeed absolutely nothing else was mentioned at all and it was clear thatthe bulk of the loot taken in 587 BC had consisted of bronze salvaged from thepillars and the ‘Sea’ – and also from the wheeled basins – that Hiram had madefour centuries earlier.A fact that argued very strongly in favour of the basic veracity of the list wasthat it was entirely consistent with the biblical account of what had previouslybeen stolen from the Temple in 598 BC. On that occasion Nebuchadnezzar had leftthe bronze items in place but had removed the ‘treasures of the house of theLord, and the treasures of the king’s house’ and had also stripped off all thegold from the furnishings of the hekal. This was why, eleven years later,Nebuzaradan’s haul of gold and silver had consisted only of a few censers andsprinkling bowls:75 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts75] he had notbeen able to find anything more valuable for the simple reason that all the bestitems had been looted and taken to Babylon in 598 BC.Since I had already satisfied myself that those items had not included the Ark,and since the relic had not been amongst the second lot of booty either, I feltincreasing confidence in my conclusion that it must have disappeared at somestage prior to the Babylonian invasions. By the same token the other oft-citedexplanation for the loss of the relic – namely that it must have been destroyedin the great fire that Nebuzaradan had started76[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts76] – also looked increasinglyuntenable. If the Ark had indeed been taken away before 598 BC – perhaps toEthiopia – then it would of course have escaped the destruction of the Temple.But was it safe, from this chain of reasoning, to deduce that it had gone toEthiopia? Certainly not. Researching the matter further I found that Judaictraditions offered several alternative explanations for what had happened – anyof which, if sufficiently strong, might prove fatal to the Ethiopian case andall of which therefore had to be considered on their merits.‘DEEP AND TORTUOUS CACHES …’The first point that became clear to me was that the Jews as a people had onlybecome conscious of the loss of the Ark – and conscious that this loss was agreat mystery – at the time of the building of the Second Temple.I was already aware that in 598 BC Nebuchadnezzar had sent into exile in Babylona large number of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.77[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts77] In 587 BC, after the burning ofSolomon’s Temple,Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard, deported the remainder of the populationleft behind in the city, the deserters who had gone over to the king of Babylon,and the rest of the common people … Thus Judah was deported from this land.78[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts78]The trauma of the banishment, the humiliations of the captivity, and the firmresolve that Jerusalem should never be forgotten, were soon to be immortalizedin one of the most poignant and evocative pieces of poetry in the whole of theOld Testament:By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we rememberedZion.We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof,For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they thatwasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if Iprefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.79[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts79]This physical exile of an entire people was not to last for very long.Nebuchadnezzar had begun the process in 598 BC and had completed it in 587.Slightly less than half a century later, however, the empire that had expandedso dramatically under his rule was utterly crushed by Cyrus the Great, king ofPersia, whose triumphant armies entered Babylon in 539 BC.80[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts80]This Cyrus, who has been described as ‘one of the world’s most astonishingempire-builders’,81 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts81] adopted anenlightened approach towards his subject peoples. There were others, like theJews, who had also been held captive in Babylon. He made it his business to setthem all free. Moreover, he permitted them to remove their confiscated idols andcult objects from the temple of Marduk and to carry these home with them.82[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts82]The Jews, of course, were unable to take full advantage of this latteropportunity, because their principal cult object, the Ark of the Covenant, hadnot been brought to Babylon in the first place. Nevertheless a large number ofthe lesser treasures that Nebuchadnezzar had seized were still intact, and thesethe Persians handed over with all due ceremony to the appropriate Judaeanofficials. The Old Testament contained a detailed report of the transaction:King Cyrus took the vessels of the Temple of Yahweh which Nebuchadnezzar hadcarried away from Jerusalem and dedicated to the temple of his god. Cyrus kingof Persia handed them over to Mithredath, the treasurer, who counted them out toSheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. The inventory was as follows: thirty goldenbowls for offerings; one thousand and twenty-nine silver bowls for offerings;thirty golden bowls; four hundred and ten silver bowls; one thousand othervessels. In all, five thousand four hundred vessels of gold and silver.Sheshbazzar took all these with him when the exiles travelled back from Babylonto Jerusalem.83 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts83]That return journey took place in 538 BC.84[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts84] Then, in the spring of 537 BC,the Second Temple began to be built above the razed foundations of the First.85[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts85] The work was finally completedaround 517 BC,86 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts86] and althoughthis was a cause for great rejoicing there were also reasons for sorrow. Theremoval of the Ark of the Covenant from the First Temple – whenever it hadoccurred – had clearly been kept secret from the public (not a difficult tasksince no one but the High Priest was supposed to enter the Holy of Holies). Now,however, after the return from Babylon, it was impossible to disguise the factthat the precious relic had gone, and that it therefore could not be installedin the inner sanctum of the Second Temple. This great change was explicitlyadmitted in the Talmud, which stated: ‘In five things the First Sanctuarydiffered from the Second: in the Ark, the Ark-cover, the Cherubim, the Fire, andthe Urim-and-Thummim.’87 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts87] TheUrim and Thummim had been mysterious objects (here referred to collectively as asingle object) that had possibly been used for divining and that had been keptin the breast-plate of the High Priest in the time of Moses. They were notpresent in the Second Temple. Neither was the celestial fire that had alwaysbeen associated with the Ark of the Covenant. And of course the Ark itself wasalso missing – together with its thick golden cover and the two golden cherubimthat had been mounted upon it.88 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts88]The secret, therefore, was out: the most precious relic of the Jewish faith hadvanished, apparently into thin air. Moreover the people knew that it had notbeen brought into captivity with them in Babylon. So where could it possiblyhave gone?Almost at once theories started to circulate and, in the normal way of things,some of these theories quickly took on the character of revealed truths. Themajority supposed that Nebuchadnezzar’s looters had failed to find the Arkbecause, before their arrival, it had been carefully hidden somewhere withinMount Moriah itself, where the Second Temple now stood on the site previouslyoccupied by the First. According to one post-exilic legend, for example, Solomonhad foreseen the destruction of his Temple even while he was building it. Forthis reason he had ‘contrived a place of concealment for the Ark, in deep andtortuous caches’.89 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts89]It was this tradition, I felt sure, that must have inspired the author of theApocalypse of Baruch to suggest that the relic had been swallowed by the earthbelow the great ‘foundation stone’ known as the Shetiyyah. I knew, of coursethat no reliance could be placed on that relatively late and apocryphal work.Nevertheless I was aware that other accounts existed which likewise identifiedsome secret cavern within the Temple Mount as the last resting place of the Ark.Reinforcing the notion that that cavern might have been located directly beneaththe Holy of Holies, the Talmud expressed the view that ‘the Ark was buried inits own place.’90 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts90] And thisentombment, it seemed, had been the work of King Josiah, who had ruled inJerusalem from 640 to 609 BC,91 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts91]i.e. until just a decade before the first Babylonian seizure of the city. Nearthe end of his long reign, the story went, foreseeing ‘the imminent destructionof the Temple’, ‘Josiah hid the Holy Ark and all its appurtenances, in order toguard them against desecration at the hands of the enemy.’92[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts92]This, I found, was quite a pervasive belief. Not all the sources, however,agreed that the place of concealment had been in the immediate vicinity of theHoly of Holies. Another parallel tradition, recorded in the Mishnah, suggestedthat the relic had been buried ‘under the pavement of the wood-house, that itmight not fall into the hands of the enemy.’93[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts93] This wood-house had stood withinthe precincts of Solomon’s Temple, but its precise location had been forgottenby the time that the Jews returned from their exile in Babylon and thus‘remained secret for all time’.94[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts94] Nevertheless the Mishnahreported that a priest had once been working in the courtyard of the SecondTemple and there, by accident, he had stumbled upon ‘a block of pavement thatwas different from the rest’:He went and told it to his fellow, but before he could make an end of the matterhis life departed. So they knew assuredly that there the Ark lay hidden.95[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts95]An entirely separate account of the concealment of the relic was put forward inthe second book of Maccabees (a work excluded from the Hebrew Bible, butincluded in the canon of the Greek and Latin Christian churches, and in theApocrypha of the English Bible96[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts96]). Compiled at some time between100 BC and AD 70 by a Jew of Pharisaic sympathies (who wrote in Greek),97[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts97] the opening verses of 2Maccabees 2 had this to say about the fate of the Ark:The prophet Jeremiah … warned by an oracle [of the impending destruction of theTemple of Solomon], gave instructions for the tabernacle and the Ark to go withhim when he set out for the mountain which Moses had climbed to survey God’sheritage. On his arrival Jeremiah found a cave dwelling, into which he broughtthe tabernacle, the Ark and the altar of incense, afterwards blocking up theentrance.98 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts98]In the opinion of the scholars who produced the authoritative Englishtranslation of the Jerusalem Bible – from which the above quotation is taken –Jeremiah’s supposed expedition to hide the Ark was nothing more than aninspirational fable devised by the author of the second book of Maccabees aspart of a deliberate attempt to re-awaken the interest of expatriate Jews in thenational homeland.99 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts99] The editorsof the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church likewise regarded the passageas being of no historical value.100[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts100] And since it was written somefive hundred years after the death of Jeremiah himself it could not even be saidto be a particularly ancient tradition101[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts101] – although its author hadattempted to dress it up as such by claiming that he had based his account on adocument found in ‘the archives’.102[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts102]It was a fact, however, that the prophet Jeremiah (unlike the author ofMaccabees) had lived at around the time of the destruction of Solomon’s Temple –which meant that he could, just conceivably, have played some role in theconcealment of the Ark. Moreover ‘the mountain which Moses had climbed to surveyGod’s heritage’ – Mount Nebo103 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts103]– was a known place that stood barely fifty kilometres to the east of Jerusalemas the crow flies.104 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts104]Culturally appropriate because of its associations with the founder of Judaism,this venerated peak thus also looked like a feasible hiding place in terms ofits geographical location.The Maccabees story had therefore not been entirely dismissed by latergenerations of Jews; on the contrary, although never incorporated into theJewish canon of Scripture, it had been substantially elaborated upon andembellished in the folklore – where, for example, the knotty problem of exactlyhow Jeremiah (who had been very much at odds with the priestly fraternity in theTemple105 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts105]) had managed to getthe sacred items out of the Holy of Holies and across the Jordan valley to Nebowas solved by providing him with an angel for a helper!106[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts106]After looking back through all the Jewish traditions that I had surveyedconcerning the last resting place of the Ark, I entered the following summary inmy notebook:Outside of the Talmud, the Mishnah, the Apocalypse of Baruch, the second book ofMaccabees, and various rather colourful legends, there is nothing of anysubstance in Jewish tradition concerning the whereabouts of the Ark of theCovenant. Since it now seems certain that it was not looted by Shishak orJehoash or Nebuchadnezzar, it therefore follows that the only alternatives tothe claim that it is in Axum are (a) very sketchy, (b) historically dubious, and(c) lacking in any current vitality (by contrast religious feeling in Ethiopiacontinues to be massively focussed upon the belief that the relic is indeedthere).All this makes the Ethiopian case look more and more credible. Nevertheless theJewish ‘alternatives’ cannot be dismissed out of hand simply because they seemto be a bit flimsy.ACTION: find out whether any archaeologists have excavated at Mount Nebo, or inand around the Temple Mount – which are the only two locations proposed by theJews as the last resting place of the Ark.I wrote that note in my hotel room in Jerusalem on the night of Saturday 6October 1990. Two days later, on the morning of Monday 8 October, I attempted togo back to take a second look at the Temple Mount, and to visit some excavationsthat I knew were in progress just outside the sacred precincts, perhaps ahundred metres to the south of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. As I approached, however –walking along the city wall from David’s Tower to the Dung Gate – the sound ofgunfire and of people screaming forewarned me that something had gone seriouslywrong.DEATH ON THE MOUNTWhat I had walked into subsequently came to be known as the ‘Temple Mountmassacre’, and although it represented the coming to a head of years of hatredbetween the Jews and the Arabs of Jerusalem, its proximate cause was ademonstration by an ultra-conservative Zionist group known as the ‘Temple MountFaithful’. The large banner that they carried as they marched up to the MoghrabiGate bore a Star of David and a provocative inscription in Hebrew whichsummarized the key issue for all concerned. That inscription read:TEMPLE MOUNT – THE SYMBOL OF OUR PEOPLE IS IN THE HANDS OF OUR ENEMIESWhat the demonstrators hoped to do was to enter the Temple Mount itself throughthe Moghrabi Gate, march up to the Dome of the Rock, and there lay thecornerstone for a proposed Third Temple. This ambition, obviously, was packedwith political dynamite: since work began on the construction of the Dome of theRock in the seventh century AD, the whole of the Temple Mount area had been asacred site of immense importance to Islam as well as to Judaism. Moreover, muchto the chagrin of groups like the ‘Temple Mount Faithful’, it is the Muslims whoare in possession of that site – which has contained no Jewish place of worshipsince the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in AD 70. Wishing todefend this status quo – against what must have looked to them like a genuinethreat – an estimated five thousand militant Arabs had gathered inside the wallsof the Temple Mount and had armed themselves with stones which they planned tohurl down at the approaching Zionists.The atmosphere was thus highly charged with emotion when the Temple MountFaithful began their march on Monday 8 October. And what added enormously to thetension was the location of the Moghrabi Gate through which they intended topass. Opening out into the main compound less than fifty metres from the frontporch of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, this gate is built into the southern end of theWestern Wall – the exposed exterior of which, known as the ‘Wailing Wall’, istoday the single most important Jewish holy place. Dating back to Second Templetimes, it is part of a retaining buttress built by Herod the Great in the latefirst century BC. It escaped demolition by the Romans in AD 70 (because, saidthe Midrash, the ‘Divine Presence’ hovered over it) and, in later years, itbecame a potent symbol of the nationalist aspirations of the Jewish peoplescattered during the diaspora. Even after the formation of the State of Israelit continued to be administered by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and it wasnot until the Six Day War of 1967 that it was finally incorporated into Israelproper. A large plaza was then cleared in front of it and dedicated as a formalplace of worship – where, to this day, Jews from all over the world gather tolament the fact that they have no Temple. To avoid a potentially catastrophicconfrontation with Islam, however, Jewish worship in any form continues to bebanned on the Temple Mount itself, which remains under the exclusive control ofthe Muslims of Jerusalem and which directly overlooks the Wailing Wall.107[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts107]By choosing to try to enter the Temple Mount through the Moghrabi Gate,therefore, the Temple Mount Faithful were asking for trouble. Access was in factdenied to them by the Israeli police but, as they turned away, the five thousandArabs who had gathered inside began to rain down showers of stones – not only onthe heads of the zealots who had participated in the march but also on the largenumbers of other Jews then making their devotions at the Wailing Wall. In thisway something that had started life as an apparently symbolic demonstration wasvery rapidly transformed into a full-scale riot in which eleven Israeliworshippers and eight policemen were hurt, and in which twenty-one Arabs wereshot dead and one hundred and twenty-five seriously injured.By the time I arrived on the scene the worst of it was over: piles of stones layamongst pools of blood at the base of the Wailing Wall; the wounded were beingferried away in ambulances; and the police – dressed in riot gear and armed tothe teeth – appeared to be in full control. The Temple Mount itself, having justbeen stormed by the security forces, was off-limits. So too was the area ofexcavations immediately to the south that I had intended to visit. Hundreds ofangry and excited Jews, a few of them proudly wearing blood-stained bandages,milled around in a decidedly bellicose mood and soon a wild celebration began infront of the Wailing Wall – although exactly why anyone should have rejoicedover the brutal killing of a score of Arab youths was something that I justcould not understand.Disgusted and depressed I eventually left the area, climbing up the steps thatled into the Jewish Quarter of the old city and crossing into the Street of theChain – along which I had walked a few days previously on my first visit to theTemple Mount. Here I saw further gratuitous violence as the police, carryingguns and truncheons, rounded up Palestinians whom they suspected of having beenamongst the rioters. One young man, protesting his innocence in a high-pitchedand terrified voice, was repeatedly punched and slapped; another ran atbreak-neck speed into a narrow alley where he was cornered and beaten beforebeing dragged away.Altogether, it had been a most unpleasant morning and it cast a blight over therest of my stay in Jerusalem. This was so not only because of the humansuffering that current events had now directly linked to the place where the Arkhad once stood, but also because the Temple Mount and the excavations to thesouth of it remained sealed off by the security forces until long after I hadleft Israel. Despite these inauspicious omens, however, I was determined not towaste any of the few days remaining to me in that unhappy country, and Itherefore continued with my investigation as best I could.DIGGING UP SACRED PLACESThe immediate question that I was seeking to answer was the one that I hadjotted down in my notebook on the night of Saturday 6 October: had any effortsbeen made by archaeologists to dig at the Temple Mount, or at Mount Nebo, inorder to test the Jewish traditions about the last resting place of the Ark?I began with the excavations that I had tried unsuccessfully to visit on themorning of 8 October. Though I could not now gain access to them, I was able tomeet with some of the archaeologists involved in them and to research theirfindings. What I learned was that proper digging had started here in February1968 – some eight months after Israeli paratroopers had seized control ofJerusalem in the Six Day War. And although all the excavations were safelyoutside the sacred precincts of the Temple Mount they had been a focus ofcontroversy from the very beginning. According to Meir Ben-Dov, Field Directorof the dig, early opposition came from members of the Higher Muslim Council, whosuspected a plot against their interests. ‘The excavations are not in fact ascientific venture,’ they complained, ‘their Zionist objective is rather toundermine the southern wall of the Temple Mount, which is likewise the southernwall of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, as a way of destroying the mosque.’108[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts108]To Ben-Dov’s surprise, Christians were at first almost equally unhelpful. ‘Theysuspected’, he explained, ‘that the purpose of the excavation was to lay thegroundwork for building the Third Temple and the whole business about anarchaeological venture was just a cover for an invidious plot. All I can say isthat until you actually hear these rumours with your own ears, they sound likethe product of a demonic imagination. Yet more than once – whether in jest orotherwise – people whose exceptional intelligence and abilities as historiansand archaeologists are beyond question have come straight out and asked me:“Don’t you intend to reinstitute the Temple?” ’109[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts109]The strongest opposition of all came from the Jewish religious authorities –whose agreement to the dig was required by the government before any work couldbegin. Professor Mazar of the Archaeological Institute of the Hebrew Universityled the negotiations with the Sephardi and Ashkenazi Chief Rabbis – both of whomturned him down flat when he first approached them in 1967:The Sephardi Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Nissim, explained his refusal by the fact thatthe area of our proposed dig was a holy place. When asked to elucidate hisanswer further, he intimated that we might prove that the Wailing Wall was notin fact the western wall of the Temple Mount. Besides, what point was there intaking the chance and conducting a dig for scientific purposes when they wereirrelevant anyway? On the other hand the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Unterman,agonized over halakhic problems (questions of Jewish law). ‘What will happen,’he mused aloud, ‘if, as a result of the archaeological excavation, you find theArk of the Covenant, which Jewish tradition says is buried in the depths of theearth?’ ‘That would be wonderful!’ Professor Mazar replied in all innocence. Butthe venerable Rabbi told the learned Professor that that was precisely what hefeared. Since the Children of Israel are not ‘pure’ from the viewpoint of Jewishreligious law, they are forbidden to touch the Ark of the Covenant. Hence it isunthinkable to even consider excavating until the Messiah comes!110[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts110]The rabbi’s concern about the Ark was entirely orthodox. All Jews have indeedbeen considered to be in a condition of ritual impurity since the destruction ofthe Second Temple – a condition that is only supposed to end with the coming ofthe true Messiah.111 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts111] Dogma ofthis sort thus represented a considerable obstacle in the path of thearchaeologists. Nevertheless they managed in due course to win the rabbis over –and also to overcome the objections of the representatives of the other twomonotheistic faiths descended from the Old Testament worship of Yahweh. The digwent ahead. Moreover, despite the location of the site outside the Temple Mount,a number of artefacts from the days of the First Temple were recovered.Predictably, though, no trace of the Ark of the Covenant was found, and the vastbulk of the discoveries proved to be from the later Second Temple, Muslim andCrusader periods.112 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts112]In summary, therefore, I could see that Meir Ben-Dov’s excavations had certainlynot vindicated the Jewish traditions about the concealment of the Ark. Butneither had they conclusively disproved those traditions. Only one thing coulddo that, and that would be a thorough and painstaking dig on the Temple Mountitself.My own feeling, as the reader will recall, was that such a dig had been carriedout by the Knights Templar long centuries before the discipline of archaeologywas ever invented, and that they, too, had failed to find the Ark. NeverthelessI still needed to know whether any excavations had been undertaken in moderntimes, and if so what had been found. I put these questions to Dr Gabby Barkai,an archaeologist at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University who specializes in the FirstTemple period.‘Since modern archaeology emerged,’ he told me bluntly, ‘no effort has been madeto dig inside the Temple Mount.’‘Why?’ I asked.‘Because it’s the ultimate sacred site. The Muslim authorities are utterlyopposed to any kind of scientific investigations being undertaken there. Itwould be the worst kind of sacrilege from their point of view. So the TempleMount remains a riddle for archaeology. Most of what we know about it istheoretical and interpretive. Archaeologically we only have the findings ofCharles Warren. And Parker of course. He actually did dig inside the Dome of theRock – in 1910 if I remember correctly. But he wasn’t an archaeologist. He was alunatic. He was looking for the Ark of the Covenant.’I was not sure from this statement whether Barkai had described Parker as a‘lunatic’ because he had looked for the Ark; or whether he had looked for theArk because he had been a lunatic; or whether his lunacy had been manifestlyapparent before he had started to dig inside the Dome of the Rock. This,however, seemed like an excellent opportunity to refrain from mentioning that I,too, was looking for the Ark. I therefore confined myself to asking thearchaeologist where I might find out more about Parker – and about CharlesWarren, the other name he had mentioned.A couple of days of archive research followed, during which I learned thatWarren had been a young lieutenant in Britain’s Royal Engineers who had beencommissioned by the London-based Palestine Exploration Fund to excavate theTemple Mount in the year 1867. His work, however, had been confined to much thesame areas – outside and to the south of the sacred precincts – that were to bemore thoroughly investigated a century later by Meir Ben-Dov and hiscolleagues.113 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts113]The difference was that Warren had very actively sought permission to excavateinside the Temple Mount as well. But all his efforts had been rebuffed by theOttoman Turks who then administered Jerusalem. Moreover, on the one occasionwhen he had managed to cut a tunnel northwards and to burrow under the exteriorwalls, the sledgehammers and other tools used by his labourers had disturbed theprayers of the faithful going on above them in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The resulthad been a hail of stones, a riot, and orders from Izzet Pasha, the governor ofthe city, that the dig should be suspended forthwith.114[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts114]Despite such difficulties, Warren had refused to be discouraged and hadpersuaded the Ottomans to let him go back to work again. He had subsequentlymade several other clandestine attempts to tunnel beneath the Temple Mount,where he had planned to ‘locate and map all the ancient remains’ that he mightencounter.115 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts115] But he was unableto realize this ambition and reached only the foundations of the exteriorwalls.116 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts116] Of course he did notfind the Ark of the Covenant – there was no evidence that it had ever been hisintention to look for it anyway. His chief interest had been in the SecondTemple period and in this context he did make many discoveries of lasting valueto scholarship.117 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts117]The same could not be said for Montague Brownslow Parker, a son of the Earl ofMorley, who had gone to Jerusalem in 1909 with the express intention of locatingthe Ark – and who had made no contribution to scholarship whatsoever.Parker’s expedition, later politely described by the renowned Britisharchaeologist Kathleen Kenyon as ‘exceptional by any standards’,118[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts118] was the brainchild of a Finnishmystic named Valter H. Juvelius, who in 1906 had presented a paper at a Swedishuniversity on the subject of the destruction of King Solomon’s Temple by theBabylonians. Juvelius claimed to have acquired reliable information about thehiding place – inside the Temple precincts – of ‘the gold-encrusted Ark of theCovenant’, and he also said that a close study that he had made of the relevantbiblical texts had revealed the existence of a secret underground passagerunning into the Temple Mount from some part of the city of Jerusalem. Afterporing over the reports of Charles Warren’s excavations, he had convincedhimself that this secret passage would be found to the south of the Al-AqsaMosque, in the area that Warren had already dug. Proffering the lure of the US$200 million that he believed the Ark would be worth if it could be recovered,Juvelius therefore sought investors to finance an expedition which would locateand clear that passage in order to gain access to the treasure.119[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts119]His fund-raising efforts were not crowned with success until, in London, heencountered Montague Brownslow Parker, then aged thirty, and won his support forthe venture. Milking his contacts in the British aristocracy and abroad,including members of Chicago’s wealthy Armour family, Parker very quicklymanaged to raise the useful sum of $125,000. The expedition accordingly wentahead and, by August 1909, had established its headquarters on the Mount ofOlives (which directly overlooks the Temple Mount).Digging began immediately on the site that Warren had previously sopainstakingly explored. Moreover Parker and Juvelius were not deterred by thefact that their illustrious predecessor had found nothing of enormoussignificance; on the contrary they proceeded with optimism – since they had bynow hired an Irish clairvoyant to assist them in their search for the supposed‘secret tunnel’.Time passed. There were the predictable protests from the faithful of allreligious persuasions. And, as winter came, the weather turned foul, floodingthe excavations with rivers of mud. Understandably, Parker was discouraged. Hecalled a temporary halt and did not resume the dig again until the summer of1910. Several months of frenetic activity then followed. The secret tunnel,however, still obstinately refused to reveal itself and, in the meantime,opposition to the whole project had grown decidedly more pronounced. By thespring of 1911 Baron Edmond de Rothschild, a Zionist and a member of the famousinternational banking family, had made it his personal mission to prevent thepotential desecration of the holiest site of Judaism, and to this end hadpurchased a plot of land adjoining the excavations from which he could directlythreaten Parker.The young British aristocrat was rattled by this development. In April of 1911,therefore, he abandoned the search for the tunnel and resorted to more desperatemeans. Jerusalem was then still under the control of the Ottoman Turks and thegovernor of the city, Amzey Bey Pasha, was not a man known for his scrupuloushonesty. A bribe of $25,000 secured his cooperation, and an additional thoughsmaller sum persuaded Sheikh Khalil – the hereditary guardian of the Dome of theRock – to admit Parker and his team to the sacred site and to turn a blind eyeto whatever they did there.The work, for obvious reasons, was carried out at dead of night. Disguised asArabs, the treasure hunters spent a week excavating the southern part of theTemple Mount close to the Al-Aqsa Mosque – where Juvelius and the Irishclairvoyant both believed that the Ark had been buried. These efforts provedentirely fruitless, however, and in the small hours of the morning of 18 April1911 Parker switched his attentions to the Dome of the Rock, and to thelegendary caverns supposed to lie far below the Shetiyyah.In those days the staircase leading down to the ‘Well of Souls’ had not yet beeninstalled and Parker and his team had to lower themselves and their equipment bymeans of ropes fastened to the Shetiyyah itself. They then lit storm lanternsand began to hack away at the floor of the grotto in the hope that they mightthus gain access to the lasting resting place of the Ark.Disaster struck before they had even begun to establish whether other hollowslay beneath them. Though Sheikh Khalil, the hereditary guardian, had been boughtoff, another mosque attendant unexpectedly appeared (the story goes that he haddecided to sleep on the Temple Mount because his own home was full of guests).Hearing the sound of digging from the Dome of the Rock he burst in, peered downinto the Well of Souls and, to his horror, saw a number of wild-eyed foreignersattacking the holy ground with picks and shovels.The reaction, on both sides, was dramatic. The shocked mosque attendant uttereda piercing howl and fled screaming into the night to rally the faithful. TheEnglishmen, wisely realizing that the game was up, also beat a hasty retreat.Not even bothering to return to their base camp, they left Jerusalem at once andmade for the port of Jaffa – where, conveniently, a motoryacht that they hadchartered lay moored in the harbour. In this way they managed to cheat thehysterical mob that arrived at the Temple Mount only moments after theirdeparture and that carried off the unfortunate Sheikh Khalil to an unspeakablefate.Before morning there were full-scale riots in Jerusalem and Amzey Bey Pasha –who was rightly suspected of complicity – had been assaulted and insulted. Hisresponse was to close the Temple Mount and to issue orders that the treasurehunters should be apprehended on their arrival at Jaffa. No doubt he took thislatter step in part to assuage his guilty conscience. However, rumours hadspread that Parker had found and abducted the Ark of the Covenant, and Muslimand Jewish leaders were vociferous in their demands that the sacred relic mustnot be allowed to leave the country.Alerted by telegraph, the Jaffa police and customs authorities arrested thefugitives, impounded all their belongings and made an extremely thorough search.They found nothing. Somewhat nonplussed by this they then locked the baggage upbut allowed the Englishmen to row out to their yacht, in the salubrioussurroundings of which, it had been agreed, the interrogation would continue. Assoon as he and his colleagues were safely on board, however, Parker ordered thecrew to weigh anchor.A few weeks later he was back in England. He had failed to find the lost Ark,but he had succeeded in losing the entire $125,000 with which investors in theUnited States and Britain had entrusted him.120[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts120] ‘The whole episode, andexcavations,’ Kathleen Kenyon concluded many years later, ‘did not redound tothe credit of British archaeology.’121[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts121]British archaeologists, however, were not involved in the next attempt to findthe Ark, which took place in the 1920s and which focussed on Mount Nebo where,according to the book of Maccabees, the prophet Jeremiah had concealed thesacred relic just before the destruction of Solomon’s Temple.The prime mover on this occasion was an eccentric American explorer who liked todress up in flowing Arab robes and who, though male, went by the curious name ofAntonia Frederick Futterer. After thoroughly surveying Mount Nebo (and also itsneighbouring peak Mount Pisgah) he claimed – with truly awe-inspiringoriginality – to have found … a secret passage. This passage was blocked by awall of some sort and Futterer did not attempt to break it down. When heexamined it by flashlight, however, he discovered … an ancient inscription,which he faithfully copied and carried back to Jerusalem. There he made contactwith a ‘scholar’ at the Hebrew University who helpfully deciphered thehieroglyphs for him. The message read:HEREIN LIES THE GOLDEN ARK OF THE COVENANTUnfortunately Futterer would not name the scholar who had produced thistranslation; nor, in the furore that followed, did anyone step forward to claimthat honour; nor was Futterer subsequently able to produce the copy that heclaimed to have made of the inscription; nor did he ever go back to Mount Neboto retrieve the Ark from its alleged secret passage.122[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts122]Half a century later, however, a new champion emerged to pick up the baton thatFutterer had dropped. That champion, too, was an American explorer, Tom Crotserby name, whose previous ‘discoveries’ had included the Tower of Babel, Noah’sArk, and the City of Adam. In 1981, by rather circuitous means, this gentlemanacquired some papers that Futterer had left, papers which apparently included asketch of the walled-up secret passage on Mount Nebo where the Ark of theCovenant was supposed to lie buried.123[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts123]Mount Nebo is located just inside the border of the modern state of Jordan andit was to that country that Crotser now flew, together with a group of zealouscolleagues from an organization known as the ‘Institute for Restoring HistoryInternational’ (headquarters: Winfield, Kansas).124[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts124] Their mission, of course, wasto salvage the Ark. To this end they spent four days sleeping rough on MountNebo – much to the consternation of the Franciscans of Terra Santa who own thesummit, who guard the Byzantine church that was erected there over the supposedburial place of Moses, and who, for the past several decades, have conductedcareful and professional archaeological excavations in the area.125[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts125]Needless to say, the Franciscans have never found the Ark, and nor did Crotser –at least not on Mount Nebo. After finishing there, however, he and his teammoved on to neighbouring Mount Pisgah (which Futterer had also visited). On thatpeak they stumbled upon a gully which they were confident would give them accessto the ‘secret passage’ identified in Futterer’s sketch.The fact that part of the floor of the gully was blocked by a length of tinsheeting only added to their excitement. On the night of 31 October 1981 theyremoved this flimsy obstacle and, sure enough, a passage stretched ahead ofthem. They followed the passage, which they said was about four feet wide andseven feet high, for a distance of some six hundred feet into the bowels of theearth. There they came across a wall exactly like the one that Futterer haddescribed and, without further ado, they broke it down.Beyond it was a rock-hewn crypt measuring roughly seven feet by seven feet andcontaining, according to Crotser, a gold-covered rectangular chest measuringsixty-two inches long, thirty-seven inches wide and thirty-seven inches high.Beside it, apparently, were carrying poles exactly matching the biblicaldescription of the carrying poles of the Ark of the Covenant. And off to oneside lay cloth-wrapped packages which Crotser assumed to be the cherubim that,in times gone by, had been mounted upon the mercy seat.The Americans were certain that they had found the sacred relic. They did notremove it; neither did they touch it or open it; using flash-guns, however, theydid take colour photographs of it. Then they left Jordan and returned to the USAwhere they immediately informed the press agency UPI about their discovery. Theresult was an internationally syndicated news story which, according to thejournalist responsible, ‘got more play than anything I wrote in my life.’126[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts126]So, had the Ark really been found? Obviously the photographs taken in the cryptwere crucial evidence that might vindicate the sensational claim that theAmericans had made – if suitably qualified biblical archaeologists were giventhe opportunity to study them. It was therefore difficult to understand whyCrotser steadfastly refused to release these pictures to anyone. Few wereconvinced by his argument that God had instructed him to give them only to theLondon banker David Rothschild who, he said, was a direct descendant of JesusChrist and had been chosen by the Lord to build the Third Temple – in which theArk of the Covenant, retrieved from its hiding place, would occupy centrestage.127 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts127]A member of the same international banking family that had opposed MontagueParker’s excavations at the Temple Mount in 1910, Rothschild icily declined totake delivery of the photographs – which Crotser still keeps in his home inWinfield, Kansas, which he still refuses to release, but which he will show toselected visitors.In 1982, one such visitor was the respected archaeologist Siegfried H. Horn, aspecialist on the Mount Nebo area and the author of more than a dozen scholarlybooks.128 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts128] He spent some timeclosely examining Crotser’s photographs which, unfortunately, seemed to havecome out of the development process rather badly:All but two showed absolutely nothing. Of the two that registered images, one isfuzzy but does depict a chamber with a yellow box in the centre. The other slideis quite good and gives a clear view of the front of the box.129[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts129]Immediately after leaving Crotser’s house, Horn (who is an accomplisheddraughtsman) made a sketch of the box as he had observed it in the slide. Someparts of the yellow metal overlay appeared to him to be brass, not gold, and,moreover, were stamped with a diamond pattern that looked machine-worked. Moredamning by far, however, was the fact that a nail with a modern style of headcould be seen protruding out of the upper right corner of the front of thebox.130 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts130] Horn concluded:I do not know what the object is but the pictures convinced me that it is not anancient artefact but of modern fabrication with machine-produced decorativestrips and an underlying metal sheet.131[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts131]FROM FICTIONS TO FACTAfter working my way steadily through the archaeological records in Jerusalem Iwas unable to trace any further references to expeditions that had sought totest the Judaic traditions about the last resting place of the Ark of theCovenant. And the scholars whom I talked to confirmed that the field was indeeda limited one: Charles Warren, and later Meir Ben-Dov and his team, had dug inthe vicinity of the Temple Mount (though they were not looking for the Ark);Montague Brownslow Parker – not an archaeologist but a ‘lunatic’, as GabbyBarkai had described him – had dug inside the Temple Mount but had not foundanything; Antonia Frederick Futterer had found, but not explored, a secretpassage on Mount Nebo which he had believed to contain the Ark; and lastly TomCrotser claimed to have found the Ark itself in that same passage – which,however, seemed to have migrated from Mount Nebo to Mount Pisgah in the fiftyyears since Futterer’s visit.And that was it. That, as the saying goes, was the boiling lot – with the soleexception of my own activities. And what was I doing? Well I was looking for theArk, too, of course – a venture in which, I must confess, I was disconcerted todiscover that I had been preceded only by Messianic visionaries and harebrainedcranks.My saving grace, I supposed, was that I had not the slightest interest in thebuilding of the Third Temple and that I did not believe that the Ark had beenburied beneath the Dome of the Rock or in Mounts Nebo or Pisgah. I realized thatit would be practically impossible to prove that those locations concealed nofurther secrets; but I was now as satisfied as I ever would be that the lostrelic had not gone to any of the places indicated in the Judaic traditions, thatit had not been taken by the Egyptians or the Babylonians, and that it had notbeen destroyed either.Its disappearance, therefore, looked more and more like a genuinely bafflingmystery – ‘one of the great mysteries of the Bible’ as Richard Elliott Friedman,Professor of Hebrew and Comparative Religion at the University of California,had once described it.132 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts132] Allmy work in 1989 and 1990 had strengthened my conviction that the solution tothat mystery must lie in Ethiopia. And yet … And yet … the one problem that Ihad not confronted at all, at any stage of my research, was that Ethiopia’sclaim to possess the Ark seemed to rest on foundations that were every bit asflimsy as the Apocalypse of Baruch or the book of Maccabees.To put matters plainly, I was beginning to feel that the Kebra Nagast’s boldassertions were not sufficiently reliable as a historical witness to justify atrip to the sacred city of Axum – a trip during which I would have to put my ownlife at risk. The insistence that the Queen of Sheba had been an Ethiopian andthe linked pretence that she had borne a son to King Solomon who, in due course,had abducted the Ark from Jerusalem, had more the ring of preposterous fictionsthan of sober truths. To be sure, I had uncovered a great deal of evidence inEthiopia – persuasive evidence – which did lend considerable support to thenotion that the relic might really lie in the sanctuary chapel in Axum. And nowI had satisfied myself that no other location could hope to present a moreconvincing case. That, however, was less a reflection of the strength of theKebra Nagast’s account of how the Ark had got to Ethiopia than of the weaknessof the alternatives.Before finally committing myself to going to Axum, therefore, I felt that Ineeded to find a more convincing explanation than that offered in the KebraNagast of how ‘the most important object in the world in the Biblical view’133[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c14-nts133] could possibly have ended up inthe heart of Africa. By the time that I finally left Jerusalem in mid-October1990 I had found that explanation – as I shall recount in the next chapter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15HIDDEN HISTORYAfter a painstaking investigation, I had satisfied myself that Ethiopia’s claimto be the last resting place of the lost Ark was not challenged by anyparticularly strong or striking alternative. That finding, however, had not beenthe only outcome of my research. As I wrote in my notebook:No one who has followed the story of the Ark from its construction at the footof Mount Sinai until the moment of its deposition in Solomon’s Temple wouldseriously dispute that it was an object of immense importance to the Jewishpeople. And yet the fact is that the Scriptures – so dominated by the presenceof the relic before Solomon – seem to forget about it entirely after him. Itsloss is formally recognized at the time of the construction of the SecondTemple. The great mystery, however, to quote the words of Professor RichardFriedman, is that: ‘There is no report that the Ark was carried away ordestroyed … There is not even any comment such as “And then the Ark disappeared,and we do not know what happened to it,” or “And no one knows where it is tothis day.” The most important object in the world, in the biblical view, simplyceases to be in the story.’1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts1]Reviewing the evidence I had to ask myself: Why should this be? Why should thecompilers of the Old Testament have allowed the Ark to vanish from the sacredtexts – not with a bang, as one might have expected, but with a whimper?The Kebra Nagast, I knew, did offer a clear answer to exactly this question. InChapter 62 it described Solomon’s grief after he had discovered that his sonMenelik had abducted the relic from the Temple and carried it off to Ethiopia.When he had had time to collect his thoughts, however, the king turned to theelders of Israel – who were likewise loudly lamenting the loss of the Ark – andwarned them to desist:Cease ye, so that the uncircumcised people may not boast themselves over us andmay not say unto us, ‘Their glory is taken away, and God hath forsaken them.’Reveal ye not anything else to alien folk …And … the elders of Israel made answer and said unto him, ‘May thy good pleasurebe done, and the good pleasure of the Lord God! As for us, none of us willtransgress thy word, and we will not inform any other people that the Ark hathbeen taken away from us.’ And they established this covenant in the House of God– the elders of Israel with their King Solomon unto this day.2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts2]In other words, if the Kebra Nagast was to believed, there had been a massivecover-up. The Ark had been removed to Ethiopia during the lifetime of Solomonhimself; all information about this tragic loss had, however, been suppressed,which was why no mention was made of it in the Scriptures.There was, I thought, much to recommend this argument. It made a great deal ofsense to suppose that the Jewish king would indeed have sought to keep from thecommon herd any knowledge of the loss of the Ark. But at the same time I hadserious problems with some other aspects of the Kebra Nagast account – notablythose concerning the Queen of Sheba’s Ethiopian credentials, her alleged loveaffair with Solomon, the birth of their son Menelik, the notion that the latterhad brought the Ark to Ethiopia, and the implication that this had happened inthe tenth century BC:1 There appeared to be no justification for the Kebra Nagast’s audacious claimthat the Queen of Sheba had been an Ethiopian woman. It was not absolutelyimpossible that she might have been (in his Antiquities of the Jews, forexample, Flavius Josephus had described her as ‘the queen of Egypt andEthiopia’3 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts3]). On balance, however,historical research did not suggest that she had started her journey in theAbyssinian highlands when, as the Bible put it, she had travelled to ‘Jerusalemwith a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, andprecious stones.’4 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts4]2 If the evidence linking the Queen of Sheba to Ethiopia was thin, then evidencefor the very existence of her son Menelik was even thinner. I had known for sometime that historians considered the supposed founder of Ethiopia’s ‘Solomonic’dynasty to be a purely legendary figure – and I had learnt nothing in two yearsof research to persuade me that they were mistaken about this rather crucialpoint.3 In particular it seemed to be inconceivable that an advanced culture and acentralized monarchy of the kind described in the Kebra Nagast could haveexisted in the Abyssinian mountains in the tenth century BC. ‘At the time whenSolomon was reigning,’ as E. A. Wallis Budge had put it, ‘the natives of thecountry which we now call Abyssinia were savages.’5[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts5] This was the orthodox view and myresearch had uncovered nothing that would enable me to refute it.4 Even more fatal to any kind of literal acceptance of the Kebra Nagas was theevidence that I myself had collected in Ethiopia. Of all the many traditionsthat I had encountered in that country, by far the purest and most convincinghad indicated that the Ark of the Covenant had been brought first of all to LakeTana, where it had been concealed on the island of Tana Kirkos. Memhir Fisseha,the priest whom I had interviewed there (see Chapter 9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c09_r1.htm]), had told me that the relic had remainedon the island for eight hundred years before it had finally been taken to Axumat the time of Ethiopia’s conversion to Christianity. Since that conversion hadoccurred around AD 330, the implication of the strong folk memory preserved onTana Kirkos was that the Ark must have arrived in Ethiopia in 470 BC orthereabouts – in other words about five hundred years after Solomon, Menelik andthe Queen of Sheba.These, of course, were not the only difficulties that I had with the accountgiven in the Kebra Nagast. Something else that bothered me greatly, for example,was the practical question of how Menelik and his companions could possibly haveremoved so precious and so heavy an object as the Ark from the Temple of Solomonwithout attracting the attention of the zealous Levites who guarded the Holy ofHolies.And I had several other reservations too, all of which, together with thoselisted above, had forced me to agree with the academic experts that the KebraNagast was indeed a remarkable document but that it had to be taken with a verylarge pinch of salt. This, however, did not make me want to dismiss the greatepic entirely. On the contrary, in common with many other legends, I felt thatthere was every possibility that its elaborate fictional superstructure mighthave been erected above a solid foundation of historical truth. In short, whilereluctantly rejecting the lovely idea of the romance between Solomon and Sheba,and the cheeky suggestion that the Ark had been stolen from the Temple by theirson Menelik, I saw no reason to conclude that the relic might not have beenbrought to Ethiopia by some other means, thus creating an enigma which the KebraNagast had much later gone on to explain in its own peculiarly original andcolourful way. Indeed, I was satisfied that the social and cultural evidence inEthiopia itself very strongly supported that country’s claim to be the lastresting place of the Ark. And, since I now also knew that no other country orplace had a stronger claim, I was more inclined than ever to believe that theArk really was there.Nevertheless, the final pieces of the jigsaw puzzle remained to be put in place.If the Queen of Sheba had not been Solomon’s lover, and if she had never bornehim a son called Menelik as the legends claimed, then who in fact had broughtthe Ark to Ethiopia – and when, and under what circumstances?THE LADY DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH, METHINKS …In my attempt to answer these questions I kept at the forefront of my mind thevery acceptable notion, put forward in the Kebra Nagast, that the removal of theArk of the Covenant from the Holy of Holies could have been the subject of acover-up – of a conspiracy of silence involving the priestly elite and the king.But, if not Solomon, then which king?Part of the definition of a ‘cover-up’, of course, is that it should bedifficult to detect. I therefore did not expect that evidence of the sort that Iwas seeking would be easily extracted from the Old Testament. That great andcomplex book had guarded its secrets well for more than two thousand years andthere was no reason to suppose that it would simply surrender them to me now.I began by typing up every single mention of the Ark of the Covenant that hadever appeared in the Bible. Even with access to the best scholarship on thesubject it was a hard task to track them all down, and when I had finished I hadbefore me a document more than fifty pages long. Strikingly and significantly,only the last page contained references that related to the period afterSolomon’s death; all the others concerned themselves with the story of the Arkduring the wanderings in the wilderness, the conquest of the Promised Land, thereign of King David, and the reign of King Solomon himself.The Bible, as I was well aware, contains a hotch-potch of material produced byseveral different schools of scribes over hundreds of years. Many of thereferences to the Ark, I knew, were very old indeed; but others were relativelylate. None of those in the first book of Kings, for example, were codifiedbefore the reign of Josiah (640–609 BC).6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts6] This meant that the account ofthe Ark’s installation in Solomon’s Temple in 1 Kings 8, although undoubtedlybased on ancient oral and written traditions, had been the work of the priestswho had lived long after the event. And exactly the same observation applied toall the relevant references in the book of Deuteronomy, since this, too, was alate document that dated only from the time of King Josiah.7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts7] Therefore, if the Ark had beensecretly removed from the Holy of Holies before the destruction of the Temple in587 BC, it seemed to me probable that the traces of any cover-up would be foundin Kings and in Deuteronomy – if they were to be found anywhere – for incompiling these books the scribes would have had an opportunity to tamper withthe facts in order to create the desired impression that ‘the glory’ had notdeparted from Israel.On close examination of the texts I came across a passage in Chapter 8 of thefirst book of Kings that seemed somehow out of character, that jarred in acurious way with the rest of the description of the great ceremony that hadsurrounded the deposition of the Ark in the Holy of Holies. That passage read asfollows:The priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its place, theinner shrine of the house, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of thecherubim. The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the Ark; they formeda screen above the Ark and its poles. The poles projected and their ends couldbe seen from the Holy Place immediately in front of the inner shrine, but fromnowhere else outside; they are there to this day.8[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts8]Why, I wondered, had the biblical scribe responsible for this passage found itnecessary to assert that the carrying poles of the Ark could, in his day, stillbe seen projecting out of the inner shrine? What would have been the point ofsuch a statement unless the relic had in fact not been there at the time thatthese words were written (approximately 610 BC according to the authorities9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts9])? The oddly defensive tone had, Ithought, the ring of one of those emphatic declarations of innocence that guiltyparties sometimes make in order to obscure the truth. In short, like the famouslady in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the author of 1 Kings 8 had aroused my suspicionsby ‘protesting too much’.10 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts10]I was pleased to discover that I was not alone in this intuition. In 1928 theleading biblical scholar Julian Morgenstern had also been struck by thestrangeness of the words ‘they are there to this day’. His conclusion, in anerudite paper published in the Hebrew Union College Annual, was that the scribemust have intendedto convince his readers that the staves of the Ark, and therefore, of course,the Ark itself, were present in the innermost part of the Temple, even thoughthey could not be seen by the people at large, or, for that matter, by anyoneother than the High Priest, when he entered the Holy of Holies once a year, onYom Kippur … The fact that [the scribe] seems to have felt compelled to insistin this manner that the Ark was still present in the Temple in hisday … indicates that he must have had to contend with a prevalent and persistentdoubt of this, a doubt founded in all likelihood upon actual fact.11[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts11]Nor was this all. The very next verse of the same chapter of the book of Kingsinsisted:There was nothing in the Ark except the two stone tablets Moses had placed init … the tablets of the covenant which Yahweh had made with the Israelites whenthey came out of the land of Egypt; they are still there today.12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts12]And the book of Deuteronomy, written at the same time, said almost exactly thesame thing – the tablets of stone were placed in the Ark by Moses, ‘and therethey have remained ever since’.13[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts13]Morgenstern’s analysis of these words was that they ‘must have been inserted forsome particular purpose’.14 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts14] And,after referring to the original Hebrew text, he concluded that this purposecould only have been to providea direct and positive affirmation, almost, it would seem, in the face of a doubtor question, that the tablets of the Ten Commandments were still present in theArk in the days … of the author of this verse.15[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts15]Deuteronomy and the first book of Kings had, of course, dealt with widelydifferent periods of Israelite history. Crucially, however – and the point is soimportant that it will bear repetition – they had both been compiled at the sametime. That time, as I had already established, had been the reign of KingJosiah, i.e. from 640 to 609 BC.My curiosity aroused, I turned to the typescript in which I had set down all thebiblical references to the Ark. I remembered that there were very few in thewhole of the Old Testament which related to the period after the death ofSolomon. Now I discovered that there were in fact only two: one had been writtenduring Josiah’s reign; the other quoted the words of Josiah himself; and bothappeared on the last page of my document.JOSIAH AND JEREMIAHI had already come across Josiah in my research. When I had been investigatingthe antiquity of the religious customs of the black Jews of Ethiopia I hadlearned that it had been during his reign that the institution of sacrifice hadfinally and conclusively been centralized on Jerusalem and banned in all otherlocations (see Chapter 6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm]). Since theFalashas themselves still practised sacrifice in Ethiopia (having altars in alltheir villages), I had concluded in my notebook that their ancestorsmust have been converted to Judaism at a time when it was still acceptable forthose far away from the centralized national sanctuary to practise localsacrifice. This would suggest that the conversion took place before KingJosiah’s ban – i.e. no later than the seventh century BC.My research had moved on into areas that I had not even dreamt of when I hadoriginally written those words in 1989, and now I was confronted by a peculiarlyinteresting set of circumstances. Sitting in my hotel room in Jerusalem inOctober 1990 I therefore opened my notebook again and listed the followingpoints:• In 1 Kings 8 and Deuteronomy there are signs of efforts being made to convincepeople that the Ark was still in its place in the Temple; this looks like anattempt to cover up the truth – i.e. that the relic was in fact no longer there.• The relevant passages were written in the time of King Josiah.• From this I conclude that the Ark may have been removed from the Temple duringJosiah’s reign; it is more likely by far, however, that its loss was discoveredthen but that it had actually occurred somewhat earlier. Why? Because Josiah wasa zealous reformer who sought to emphasize the paramount importance of theTemple in Jerusalem – and because the raison d’être of the Temple was as ‘anhouse of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord’. It is virtuallyinconceivable that such a monarch would have permitted the ultimate symbol ofJudaism, the sign and the seal of Yahweh’s presence on earth, to be taken out ofthe Holy of Holies. The logical deduction, therefore, is that the Ark must havebeen spirited away before Josiah came to power – i.e. before 640 BC.• The religious customs of the Falashas include local sacrifice, a practice thatwas only conclusively banned during Josiah’s reign. On the basis of this andother data it has been my opinion for some time that the ancestors of theFalashas must have migrated to Ethiopia before 640 BC.• Surely these matters cannot be unconnected?The chain of evidence looked convincing: the Ark was removed from the Templebefore 640 BC; the ancestors of the Falashas migrated to Ethiopia before 640 BC;was it therefore not reasonable to assure that the ancestors of the Falashasmight have taken the Ark with them?This struck me as a fairly logical hypothesis. It did not, however, establishwhen before 640 BC the supposed migration from Jerusalem had taken place.Neither did it entirely rule out the possibility that the Ark could have beenremoved during Josiah’s reign. Given the known religious integrity andtraditionalism of that monarch the latter notion looked like a very long shotindeed. Nevertheless it had to be considered – if only because, as I alreadyknew (see previous chapter [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm]), certain Jewishlegends had furnished him with a valid motive. In the last years of his reign,those legends said, he had foreseen the destruction of the Temple by theBabylonians and had hidden ‘the Holy Ark and all its appurtenances in order toguard them against desecration at the hands of the enemy.’16[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts16] Moreover he was believed –possibly by miraculous means – to have concealed the relic ‘in its own place’.17[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts17]I was now as satisfied as I ever would be that the Ark had not been buried inthe Temple Mount – or anywhere else in the Holy Land. Nevertheless I still hadto ask myself: was this possible? Could Josiah really have foreseen the fate ofthe Temple and taken steps to safeguard the Ark?I looked into this scenario but concluded that, unless the Jewish king hadpossessed a truly remarkable gift of prescience, there was just no way that hecould have predicted the events of 598–587 BC. He died in 609 BC, five yearsbefore Nebuchadnezzar – the author of Jerusalem’s destruction – inherited theBabylonian throne.18 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts18] Moreover,Nebuchadnezzar’s predecessor Nabopolassar had shown little or no militaryinterest in Israel and had concentrated instead on wars with Assyria andEgypt.19 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts19]The historical background to Josiah’s reign therefore did not support the theorythat he might have concealed the Ark of the Covenant. More damning by far,however, was the very last mention of the sacred relic in the Old Testament,which cropped up in a passage in the second book of Chronicles – a passage thatdescribed Josiah’s campaign to restore traditional values to Temple worship:Josiah removed all the abominations throughout the territories belonging to thesons of Israel … And he set the priests in their charges, and … said unto theLevites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the Lord, ‘Put the Holy Arkin the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shallnot be a burden upon your shoulders.’20[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts20]It was immediately obvious to me that these few short verses, particularly thewords emphasized in italics above, were of vital importance to my quest. Why?Quite simply because Josiah would have had no need to ask the Levites to put theArk in the Temple if it had already been there. Two inescapable conclusionsemerged from this: (1) The king himself could not have been responsible for theremoval of the relic because he plainly thought that it had been taken by itstraditional bearers, the Levites; and (2) the date of the Ark’s disappearancefrom the Temple could now be fixed to some time before Josiah had made thislittle speech.And when exactly had that speech been made? Happily the book of Chroniclesprovided a very precise answer to this question: ‘in the eighteenth year of thereign of Josiah’21 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts21] – in otherwords in 622 BC.22 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts22] WhatChronicles did not do, however, was give any indication at all that the Leviteshad complied with the king’s order; indeed, far from the colourful ceremony thatone might have expected to accompany any reinstallation of the Ark in theTemple, there was no follow-up – either in this book or in any other part of theBible – to Josiah’s strange command. On the contrary, it was clear that hiswords had fallen on deaf ears or on the ears of people who were not in aposition to obey them.Chronologically, as I have already observed, Josiah’s speech contained the lastreference to the Ark of the Covenant in the whole of the Old Testament. I nowturned to examine the penultimate reference. This occurred in the book ofJeremiah, in a chapter composed by Jeremiah himself around the year 626 BC,23[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts23] and took the form of a propheticutterance addressed to the people of Jerusalem:And when you have increased and become many in the land, then – it is Yahweh whospeaks – no one will ever say again ‘Where is the Ark of the Covenant ofYahweh?’ There will be no thought of it, no memory of it, no regret for it, nomaking of another. When that time comes, Jerusalem shall be called: ‘The throneof Yahweh’; all nations will gather there in the name of Yahweh and will nolonger follow the dictates of their own stubborn hearts.24[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts24]Like Josiah, I knew that Jeremiah had been credited in certain Jewish legends –and in the apocryphal book of Maccabees – with hiding the Ark (in his case onMount Nebo immediately before the destruction of the Temple – see previouschapter). The words quoted above, however, had infinitely greater value ashistorical testimony than the legends or the Apocrypha because they had beenspoken at a known date by a real person, Jeremiah himself.25[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts25] Moreover, in the context ofeverything else that I had learned, there could be no doubt about the meaning ofthese words, or about their wider implications. To put matters as plainly aspossible, they corroborated the impression given in Josiah’s speech that the Arkwas no longer in the Temple by 622 BC – and they pushed back to at least 626 BCthe likely date at which it had gone missing. I say at least to 626 BC becausethat, as noted above, was the year in which Jeremiah had uttered his prophecy.It was clear, however, that in doing so he had been responding, at least inpart, to some prevalent and probably by then quite long-established anguish overthe loss of the Ark. This was the only possible explanation for the verse whichstated: ‘And when you have increased and become many in the land, then … no onewill ever say again “Where is the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh?” ’ Obviously ifpeople had not been saying such things in 626 BC, and for some considerablewhile beforehand, then there would have been no need for Jeremiah to have madesuch a remark.In reaching this judgment I was pleased to discover that I had the full supportof one of the world’s leading biblical scholars, Professor Menahem Haran ofJerusalem’s Hebrew University. In his authoritative treatise on Temples andTemple Service in Ancient Israel, this learned academic had considered thepassage in question and had reached the following conclusion:This verse follows upon words of consolation and itself contains a message ofconsolation and mercy. What the prophet promises here is that in the good daysto come there will no longer be any need for the Ark – implying that its absenceshould no longer cause any grief. These words would, of course, be devoid of anysignificance if the Ark [had] still … been inside the Temple at the time.26[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts26]On this basis I felt that it was entirely safe to conclude that I would have topeer back into the period before 626 BC if I was to have any prospect ofestablishing the actual date on which the Ark had disappeared. Moreover I didnot think that it would be at all fruitful to devote time to a close study ofthe earlier years of King Josiah’s reign – i.e. from 626 BC back to 640 BC. As Ialready knew, that monarch had sought unsuccessfully to have the relicreinstalled in the Temple in 622 BC; it was therefore hardly likely that hewould have been responsible for its removal in the first place. The guilty partymust have been one of his predecessors – any one, in fact, of the fifteen kingswho had ruled in Jerusalem since Solomon had placed the Ark in the Holy ofHolies in 955 BC.27 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts27]SEARCH AND FINDI was looking at a period of 315 years – from 955 BC down to Josiah’s accessionto the throne in 640 BC. In this time Jerusalem and the Temple had been at thecentre of an enormously complex series of events. And although these events weredescribed at great length in several books of the Bible, the Ark of the Covenanthad not been mentioned once: between Solomon and Josiah, as I had previouslyestablished, the sacred relic had been enshrouded in a thick blanket of silence.I resorted to a modern research tool to find out just how thick that ancientblanket really was. On the desk in my hotel room in Jerusalem was a computerizededition of the King James Authorized Version of the Bible that I had broughtwith me from England.28 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts28] For theperiod that I was now interested in I knew that it would be useless to run asearch-and-find programme on the words ‘Ark’ or ‘Ark of the Covenant’ or ‘Ark ofGod’ or ‘Holy Ark’ or any similar epithets: they simply did not appear. I did,however, have one other option, and that was to look for phrases that had beenregularly associated with the Ark earlier in the Scriptures, and also forreports of afflictions of the type routinely caused by the Ark.In the realm of afflictions I settled on the word ‘leprous’, because, in Chapter12 of the book of Numbers Moses had punished Miriam for criticizing hisauthority by using the powers of the Ark to make her ‘leprous’.29[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts29] In the realm of phrases I chose‘between the cherubims’, because the God of Israel had been believed to dwell‘between the cherubims’ mounted on the Ark’s golden lid and because, prior tothe reign of Solomon, this formula had always been used in connection with theArk and never in any other way.30[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts30]I started by running the word ‘leprous’. My electronic Bible of course picked itup in Chapter 12 of the book of Numbers, which described what happened toMiriam. After that it occurred only twice more in the whole of the Scriptures:in the second book of Kings, where there was a plainly irrelevant reference to‘four leprous men’ sitting by a gate in the northern Israelite city ofSamaria;31 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts31] and in the secondbook of Chronicles – where it cropped up in a passage that looked very relevantindeed.That passage, in 2 Chronicles 26, described how King Uzziah – who had ruledJerusalem from 781 to 740 BC32 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts32] –‘transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the Temple of the Lord toburn incense upon the altar of incense.’33[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts33] At once the High Priest Azariahand some of his assistants rushed in after the monarch hoping to dissuade himfrom committing this act of sacrilege at the very entrance to the Holy ofHolies:Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and whilehe was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead beforethe priests in the house of the Lord, from beside the incense altar.34[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts34]It seemed that Uzziah had not actually entered the Holy of Holies (although thetext was somewhat ambiguous on this point), but he had certainly stood veryclose to it. Moreover he had been holding a metal incense burner in his hand –and that, since the two sons of Aaron had been struck down at the foot of MountSinai for offering ‘strange fire before the Lord’,35[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts35] had always been a dangerousthing to do within striking distance of the Ark.36[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts36]On this basis, therefore, I felt that there was at least a prima facie case forconcluding that the ‘leprous’ sores on Uzziah’s forehead had been caused byexposure to the Ark (and I was later to discover that others had thought so too– an illustration from an eighteenth-century English Bible reproduced in thepresent work clearly shows the unfortunate king standing beside the Ark at thevery moment that he is ‘smitten’).If the monarch’s affliction was caused by the Ark [I wrote in my notebook] thenthis means that it was still present in the Holy of Holies in 740 BC (Uzziah’sreign ended in that year as a result of what had happened to him37[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts37]). This narrows the fieldenormously, since the implication is that the relic could only have been removedin the century between that date and the beginning of Josiah’s reign – i.e. atsome point between 740 BC and 640 BC.Of course I was well aware that the Uzziah incident had little value ashistorical evidence: it was a tantalizing hint – a clue if you like – but it wasquite impermissible to conclude from it that the Ark had definitely still beenin the Temple in 740 BC. I needed something stronger if I was to be satisfiedthat that had indeed been the case – and I found what I was looking for when Iran a search for the phrase ‘between the cherubims’.As noted above, in biblical passages referring to the period before the reign ofSolomon, these words had been used exclusively in connection with the Ark, andin no other way whatsoever. Although it would be necessary to keep a close eyeon the context, I therefore felt that any recurrence of these words after thedeposition of the relic in the Temple in 955 BC would constitute strong evidencethat it had in fact still been present in the Holy of Holies on the date – ordates – that the phrase had been used.Accordingly I programmed my computer to search for the words ‘between thecherubims’. A few seconds later I knew that they had been cited only seven timesin the entire post-Solomonic period.Two of these citations, in Psalm 80:1 and in Psalm 99:1, clearly referred to thecherubim of the Ark. Unfortunately they were impossible to date with any degreeof accuracy:38 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts38] there was a smallchance that they were pre-Solomonic, but the balance of scholarly opinion heldthat the relevant verses were likely to have been composed in the ‘early yearsof monarchy’39 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts39] – i.e. duringSolomon’s lifetime or within a century or so of his death.The words ‘between the cherubims’ also cropped up three times in the book ofEzekiel,40 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts40] which was a late workwritten after the year 593 BC.41 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts41]In this context, however, all the uses of the phrase were irrelevant to myinvestigation because: (a) the ‘cherubims’ referred to had been seen by Ezekielin a vision that came to him while he sat in his house;42[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts42] (b) they were described ashaving ‘four faces’ and ‘four wings’ each, whereas the cherubim of the Ark hadeach only one face and two wings;43[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts43] and (c) they were clearly livingcreatures of enormous size, not the relatively compact figurines of solid goldthat had faced each other across the ‘mercy seat’.44[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts44] Indeed, at the end of Ezekiel’svision, his cherubims ‘lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in mysight … and the sound of the cherubims’ wings was … even … as the voice of theAlmighty God when he speaketh.’45[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts45]In my hunt for references that might prove the continued presence of the Ark inthe Jerusalem Temple at particular periods, therefore, Ezekiel’s cherubims wereof no consequence and could safely be ignored. This meant that out of all theoccurrences of the phrase that I had instructed my computer to search for I wasnow left with only two that might be of any help to me at all. These appeared inChapter 37 of the book of Isaiah and in Chapter 19 of the second book ofKings.46 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts46] Both recounted the sameevent, both were of great importance, and both clearly and unambiguouslyreferred to the Ark of the Covenant – though they did not mention it by name.This is what they said (the Isaiah version, the older of the two, is in theleft-hand column; the Kings version is in the right-hand column):Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord, and … prayed unto the Lord, saying,O Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou artthe God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth.47[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts47] Hezekiah went up into the houseof the Lord, and … prayed before the Lord, and said, O Lord God of Israel, whichdwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all thekingdoms of the earth.48 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts48]As the reader will no doubt have observed, both passages not only spoke of thesame event but also did so in almost exactly the same language. Indeed theverses in Kings came very close to being a verbatim repeat of the verses inIsaiah. Those verses, scholars were agreed, had been written by Isaiahhimself.49 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts49] And, since a greatdeal was known about the life, times and activities of this famous prophet, itwas possible to put a fairly precise date on his account of Hezekiah’s prayer tothe God of Israel that dwelled ‘between the cherubims’.Isaiah was called to the prophetic office in 740 BC50[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts50] – the very year in which KingUzziah had died after being smitten with leprous sores in the incident describedearlier.51 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts51] He then continued hisministry throughout the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah (respectively740–736 BC, 736–716 BC and 716-687 BC).52[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts52] Of crucial significance to myinvestigation was a fact upon which academic opinion was unanimous: the verse inwhich my computer had flagged the phrase ‘between the cherubims’ had beenwritten by Isaiah in 701 BC – the year in which the Assyrian King Sennacheribhad tried and failed to capture Jerusalem.53[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts53]Indeed, it had been on Isaiah’s direct advice that Hezekiah – the Judaeanmonarch – had refused to surrender the city to the Assyrians.54[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts54] Sennacherib’s response had beento send a letter threatening death and destruction, and Hezekiah had actuallybeen carrying this letter55 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts55] whenhe had gone up ‘unto the house of the Lord, and … prayed unto the Lord, saying,O Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou artthe God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth.’Hezekiah’s prayer had continued as follows:Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord, and see: and hearall the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God. Of atruth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and theircountries.… Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all thekingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord, even thou only.56[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts56]Miraculously, the Lord complied. First he sent his prophet Isaiah to Hezekiahwith this message:Thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into thiscity, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bankagainst it … For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake.57[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts57]Yahweh was as good as his word. That very nightThe angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians ahundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in themorning, behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of Assyriadeparted.58 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts58]There could be no doubt about the historicity of these events: the Assyrians hadsurrounded Jerusalem in 701 BC and they had suddenly lifted their siege andfled.59 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts59] Scholars believed thatthis had happened because they had been afflicted by an outbreak of bubonicplague.60 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts60] Strangely, however,there was no evidence that anyone in Jerusalem itself had gone on to contractthis easily transmissible disease. In the context of everything that I hadlearned hitherto, therefore, I could not help but wonder whether the Ark of theCovenant might not in some way have been involved in Sennacherib’s undoing. Themass slaughter that had taken place did sound very much like the sort of‘miracle’ that, in earlier times, the relic had so frequently performed.61[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts61]But this was only an intuition, a hunch of my own. It had no status whatsoeveras evidence of the continued presence of the Ark in the Temple in 701 BC. Whatdid have that status was Isaiah’s pure and eloquent testimony that King Hezekiahhad prayed for his deliverance to the ‘God of Israel, that dwellest between thecherubims’. The monarch uttered this prayer inside the Temple.62[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts62] Moreover the full text of thefirst verse of the passage containing this citation not only stated that he hadcarried Sennacherib’s threatening letter with him – as noted above – but alsoadded that he had ‘spread it before the Lord’.63[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts63] In just such a fashion, thoughin an earlier era, ‘Solomon … came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of theCovenant of the Lord … and offered peace offerings.’64[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts64] In just such a fashion, thoughin an earlier era, ‘David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord onall manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and psalteries, andon timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.’65[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts65] And in just such a fashion,though in an earlier era, ‘the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the Arkof the Covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, andto bless his name.’66 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts66]To cut a long and convoluted story very short indeed, the fact that Hezekiah hadspread Sennacherib’s letter out ‘before the Lord’, and then had prayed to the‘God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims’ made it quite certain thatthe Ark of the Covenant had been in the Holy of Holies at that time. There wasno other way in which this passage could be interpreted. And because it did soeffectively prove the continued presence of the relic within the Temple longafter the reign of Solomon it also dealt a fatal blow to the Kebra Nagast’sclaim that the Ark had been stolen by Menelik while Solomon was still alive.I was not sure whether I should rejoice over this discovery or whether I shouldlament it. I always find it slightly depressing when a beautiful myth isdiscredited. And although I still hoped to vindicate the central contention ofthe Kebra Nagast – namely that the Ark had indeed gone to Ethiopia (although ofcourse not by the hand of Menelik) – I had absolutely no idea how I was going todo this.Rather dispiritedly, therefore, I turned back to the piles of research papersand books spread out all around me in my hotel room in Jerusalem. The good news,I supposed, was that my investigation had come a long way. I had satisfiedmyself that the Ark had not been removed from the Temple either during or afterthe reign of King Josiah, which had begun in 640 BC. Moreover it was now clearthat it had still been in its place in the Holy of Holies in 701 BC, the date ofHezekiah’s prayer. This left just sixty-one years in which it could havedisappeared, and even that period could be narrowed down somewhat. Why? Becauseit seemed obvious that Hezekiah himself would not have allowed the sacred relic– before which he had prayed so efficaciously – to be carried off by anyone.Hezekiah had died in 687 BC and Josiah had taken the throne in 640 BC. Betweenthem there were only two monarchs – Manasseh (687–642 BC) and Amon (642–640BC).67 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts67] It followed that the lossof the Ark must have occurred during the reigns of one or other of these twokings.THE SIN OF MANASSEHAs I immersed myself in the biblical texts once again it quickly became apparentthat the guilty party could only have been Manasseh, who was castigatedunmercifully by the scribes because:He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, after the abominations ofthe heathen … For he … reared up altars for Baal … and worshipped all the hostof heaven, and served them. And he built altars in the house of the Lord … forall the host of heaven … And he made his son pass through the fire, and … usedenchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought muchwickedness in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger … And he set agraven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the Lord saidto David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I havechosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever.68[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts68]What was this ‘graven image of the grove’ that Manasseh had made? And whereexactly in the Temple had he put it?To find an answer to the first question I temporarily abandoned the King JamesAuthorized Version of the Bible (from which the above quotation is taken) andturned to the more modern Jerusalem Bible which informed me that the ‘gravenimage of the grove’ was in fact a ‘carved image of Asherah’, an arboreal pagandeity.69 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts69] The answer to thesecond question was self-evident: the ‘house’ in which Yahweh had said that hewould put his ‘name for ever’ was the Holy of Holies of the Temple – the debir,the dense golden cell that Solomon had ‘designed … to contain the Ark of theCovenant of Yahweh.’70 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts70]The implications of what I had just learnt were enormous. Manasseh, who had done‘that which was evil in the sight of the Lord’, had introduced an idol into theHoly of Holies of the Temple. In taking this momentous step backwards towardspaganism it was inconceivable that he could have allowed the Ark of the Covenantto remain in its place – since the Ark was the sign and the seal of Yahweh’spresence on earth and the ultimate symbol of the fiercely monotheistic Judaicfaith. At the same time it was improbable that the apostatizing king wouldactually have destroyed the sacred relic: on the contrary, with his predilectionfor enchantments and wizardry, he would have regarded that as a most unwisething to do. The most likely scenario, therefore, was that he would have orderedthe Levites to remove the Ark from the Temple before he installed his ‘Asherah’in the inner sanctum. And this would have been an order that they would havebeen more than happy to comply with: as faithful servants of Yahweh they wouldhave done anything within their power to avoid the pollution of the object thatthey regarded as the ‘footstool’ of their God71[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts71] – and they could hardly haveimagined any worse pollution than for it to have to share the Holy of Holieswith the graven image of some alien deity. As priests they would not have beenin a position to prevail militarily against a powerful monarch like Manasseh;their best course of action would have been to bow to the inevitable and tocarry the Ark away to a place of safety.There were even indications in the Bible that the relic’s enforced departurefrom the Temple might have resulted in some kind of mass public protest againstthe king – a protest that he had ruthlessly suppressed. This was only guessworkon my part, of course, but such a hypothesis did help to explain why Manassehwas said to have ‘shed innocent blood … in such great quantity that he floodedJerusalem from end to end.’72 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts72]At any rate, it was clear that the reign of this monarch had, in later years,come to be regarded as a blot, an aberration and an abomination. He had beensucceeded by his son Amon in 642 BC and Amon had in turn been succeeded in 640BC by Josiah, the zealous reformer who was famous (and beloved of the scribes)for having restored the traditional worship of Yahweh.Why had Amon’s tenure of the throne been so brief? Because, as the Bibleexplained, he had donethat which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasseh did. And hewalked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that hisfather served, and worshipped them … And the servants of Amon conspired againsthim, and slew the king in his own house … and the people of the land made Josiahhis son king in his stead.73 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts73]Josiah, however, had been only ‘eight years old when he began to reign’74[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts74] and it was not until eight yearsafter that, the Bible reported, that he had shown the first signs of wanting to‘seek after the God of David’.75 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts75]Indeed the young monarch’s passionate reaction against the sins of Manasseh andAmon did not begin until the ‘twelfth year’ of his reign when – at the age oftwenty – he launched a campaign ‘to purge Judah and Jerusalem from … the carvedimages, and the molten images’.76[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts76]And he brought out the grove [Asherah] from the house of the Lord, right out ofJerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it in the brook Kidron, and stampedit to small powder, and cast the powder thereof on the common burying ground.77[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts77]A passionate reaction indeed! And, moreover, one that could be dated: it hadbeen in 628 BC, the twelfth year of Josiah’s reign, that Manasseh’s loathsomeidol had at last been rooted out of the Holy of Holies. The Ark, however, hadcertainly not been brought back in to replace it. As I already knew, Jeremiahhad been responding to public grief at the continued absence of the relic twoyears later when he had prophesied that a time would eventually come when peoplewould no longer ask ‘where is the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh’ – a time whenthey would have ‘no regret for it’ and when they would not consider ‘makinganother’.Four years after that Josiah himself had rather forlornly asked the Levites torestore the Ark to the Temple, adding ‘it shall not be a burden for yourshoulders’. That had been in 622 BC, the eighteenth year of his reign, and itwas no coincidence that it had been in that very same year, having completed alengthy nationwide purge, that he had ‘returned to Jerusalem’ and issued orders‘to repair the house of the Lord his God’.78[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts78]The repairs had been duly carried out by ‘carpenters and builders and masons’.79[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts79] The great mystery, however, wasthat the Levites had been unable to comply with Josiah’s request that theyshould ‘put the Holy Ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king ofIsrael did build.’ I was now increasingly sure that the answer to that mysterymust lie in Ethiopia – although I was not yet in a position to fathom outexactly how or why.Meanwhile I sought academic support for my view that it must have been duringthe reign of Manasseh that the Ark had gone missing in the first place. I foundthat support in an authoritative treatise that I had already had occasion toconsult several times before – Professor Menahem Haran’s Temples and TempleService in Ancient Israel. Here, in a brief section in the middle of the book, Iread that:throughout the various changes that took place in the Kingdom of Judah, theTemple at Jerusalem never ceased to serve exclusively as a Temple ofYahweh … There was only one single period in its history when it was temporarilydeprived of its original function and for a short while ceased to serve as aTemple to Yahweh … This occurred during the reign of Manasseh … who set upvessels for Baal … in the outer sanctum and introduced the image of Asherah intothe inner sanctum of the Temple … This is the only happening which may explainthe disappearance of the Ark and the cherubim … We are entitled to infer thatthe image of Asherah … was substituted for the Ark and the cherubim. Some fiftyyears afterwards, when Josiah removed the Asherah from the Temple and burnt itin the Kidron Valley, beating it to dust and desecrating even the dust, the Arkand the cherubim were no longer there.80[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c15-nts80]After making a number of telephone calls to the Hebrew University I managed totrack down Professor Haran. I told him that I had read his book and that I wasexcited by his suggestion that the Ark of the Covenant might have been lostduring the reign of Manasseh. Could he spare me half an hour or so to discussthe matter further? He replied that he would be only too happy to do so andinvited me to visit him at his home in Jerusalem’s Alfasi Street.Haran proved to be an elderly but robust man, grey-haired and solidly built –the very image of the type of learned but eminently practical biblical scholarthat one meets so often in Israel. I told him a little about my own research andthen asked whether he was certain in his own mind that the Ark had indeed beenremoved from the Temple in Manasseh’s time.‘Yes,’ he replied with conviction, ‘I am as certain of that as I can possiblybe. This is why the Ark is not referred to in the long lists of Temple vesselsand treasures that were later taken by the Babylonians. And I should add withall modesty that my views on this subject have never been refuted inscholarship.’I took this opportunity to put a question that had been bothering me for sometime: ‘If the Ark was taken out as a result of Manasseh’s idolatry then how doyou account for the fact that the Scriptures make absolutely no mention of theloss?’‘I account for it in this way. To have to write down such a report would havefilled the scribes with disgust – with such a horrible feeling – that definitelythey would have averted from it. I therefore believe that they deliberatelyrefrained from reporting the loss of the Ark. Even in what they did report ofManasseh’s reign their feelings of utter horror do come through. Yet they couldnot bring themselves to indulge in a description of the occurrence itself.’‘Do you have any idea at all’, I asked next, ‘what could have happened to therelic after it was removed?’Haran shrugged: ‘On that I cannot speculate. It is impossible to prove. I canonly say with confidence that the orthodox priests of Yahweh would under nocircumstances have permitted the Ark of Yahweh to stay in the same place as theidol of Asherah.’‘So do you think they took it away somewhere? To a place of safety?’Another shrug: ‘As I say, I cannot speculate on such matters. However it isevident from our records, from the Holy Writ, that Jerusalem itself – in factthe whole country – was not a safe place for those who were loyal to the worshipof Yahweh during Manasseh’s time.’‘Are you referring to the passage in the book of Kings that talks about innocentblood being spilled?’‘Yes. 2 Kings 21:16. And not only that. Jeremiah also speaks obliquely of thesame events when he says “your sword hath devoured your prophets like adestroying lion”. I have no doubt that this was a reference to the acts ofManasseh and I infer from it that certain prophets had opposed him and that forthis they were massacred. It is an interesting phenomenon, you know, that you donot find any prophets at all during the reign of Manasseh himself – Jeremiahcame just afterwards and others, like Isaiah, came just before. The gap was theresult of persecutions and of a sustained campaign against the worship ofYahweh.’The Professor would not be pushed any further on this subject and resolutelyrefused to indulge in what he obviously regarded as idle speculation about wherethe Ark could have gone. When I mentioned my theory that it might have beentaken to Ethiopia he looked at me blankly for about half a minute and thenconcluded: ‘That seems rather far.’A TEMPLE ON THE NILEAfter interviewing Menahem Haran I returned to my hotel feeling directionlessand confused. Of course it had been exciting to get his confirmation that theArk had been lost during Manasseh’s reign. The trouble was, however, that I nowseemed to have arrived at the brink of a deep intellectual precipice. Ethiopiawas indeed ‘rather far’ from Jerusalem, and I could see no good reason why theloyal priests of Yahweh who had carried the sacred relic out of the Templeshould subsequently have taken it to such a distant place.Moreover, the dates didn’t fit. Manasseh had sat on the throne in Jerusalem from687 to 642 BC, but the Tana Kirkos traditions asserted that the Ark had notarrived in Ethiopia until approximately 470 BC. So I was still two hundred yearsadrift.As I chewed over this problem I realized that what I needed to do was to talk tosome Ethiopians. And what better place was there in which to talk to Ethiopiansthan in the State of Israel? After all, tens of thousands of Falashas – whoclaimed citizenship under the terms of the Law of Return – had been airliftedhere over the past decade. Surely amongst them there must be some elders,knowledgeable in the folk memory of their people, who could help me to bridgethe geographical and chronological abyss that yawned before me?Further enquiries at the Hebrew University produced the name of Shalva Weil, asocial anthropologist who had specialized in far-flung Jewish communities andwho was regarded as something of an expert on Falasha culture. I telephoned herat her home and, after introducing myself, asked her if she could recommend anymember of the Falasha community in Jerusalem who might be able to speak withauthority on the ancient traditions of the Ethiopian Jews.‘Your best bet’, she replied without hesitation, ‘would be Raphael Hadane. He’sa priest, a very senior priest. He’s been here for a few years. He’s an elderlyman and extremely knowledgeable. The only problem is he doesn’t speak English soyou should try to see him with his son.’‘Whose name is?’‘Yoseph Hadane. He came to Israel as a boy in the early 1970s and he’s now afully trained rabbi. He does speak fluent English so he’ll be able to translatefor you.’Arranging the meeting took up most of my last two days in Jerusalem. Finally,however, I did manage to get together with the Hadane family at the FalashaAbsorption Centre, which was located in a suburb called Mevasserit Zion to thewest of the city. Here I found hundreds of Ethiopians, some newly arrived,others long-term residents, living in a somewhat ramshackle housing estate.Raphael Hadane, the Falasha priest, was dressed in a traditional Abyssinianshemma and sported a considerable beard. His son, the rabbi, was clean-shavenand wore a smart business suit. For a long while we sat around drinking tea andexchanging pleasantries while children played at our feet and various assortedrelatives came and went. One of these latter, as it happened, had been born andbrought up in the village of Anbober, which I had visited in January 1990 on mytrip to Gondar.‘Does Anbober really still exist?’ he asked me rather plaintively. ‘It’s fiveyears since I left home.’‘It does still exist,’ I replied, ‘or rather it did in January. The populationseemed to be mainly women and children, though.’‘This is because the men emigrate first to prepare a place for their families.Did you talk to anyone there?’I told them that I had interviewed the priest, Solomon Alemu, and this broughtsmiles of recognition from everyone around the table. ‘They all know him well,’explained Rabbi Hadane. ‘Ours is a small society … and close knit.’Eventually I switched on my tape-recorder and began the interview with therabbi’s venerable father. Much of what he had to say about Falasha culture andreligion was already very familiar. When I turned to what was now the centralissue for me, however – i.e. exactly how and when Judaism had arrived inEthiopia – he told me something that made me prick up my ears.I had asked a leading question about Menelik and the Queen of Sheba – hoping,after the ritual repetition of the Kebra Nagast story, to pin the old man downon the matter of the date that Menelik’s supposed journey had taken place.Hadane surprised me by dismissing the legend entirely: ‘Some of us say that weare descended from the Israelites who accompanied Menelik, but personally I donot believe that. According to the traditions that I heard in my childhood, ourancestors were Jews who had first lived in Egypt before they came to Ethiopia.’‘But,’ I interjected, ‘the Kebra Nagast says that too. It says that Menelik andhis companions travelled through Egypt.’‘That is not what I mean. After leaving Israel, our forefathers did not justtravel through Egypt. They settled in that country for a very long time – forhundreds of years. And they built a temple there.’I leaned forward over the tape-recorder: ‘A temple? Where did they build thistemple?’‘At Aswan.’This, I thought, was very interesting. Solomon Alemu, the priest at Anbober, hadalso mentioned Aswan to me when I had interviewed him in January. At the time Ihad resolved to make a trip there. And I had in fact travelled quite widely inEgypt since doing that interview. I had not yet gone as far south as Aswan,however, and I was now beginning to wonder whether that might not have been amistake. If there had indeed been a Jewish temple there, as Hadane had justindicated, then this was potentially a matter of great importance – because thefunction of the Temple in orthodox Judaism had been to house the Ark of theCovenant. If it was true that a temple had been built at Aswan, and if this hadhappened after the Ark had been removed from Jerusalem, then the implicationswere obvious.Hadane was unable to be at all specific as to the date of this Aswan temple,however. All he could tell me was that it had endured ‘for a long while’ butthat it had eventually been destroyed.‘Why was it destroyed?’‘There was a great war in Egypt. A foreign king who had captured many countriescame to Egypt and destroyed all the temples of the Egyptians. But he did notdestroy our temple. So when the Egyptians saw that only the Jewish temple wasnot destroyed they suspected we were on the side of the invader. Because of thisthey started to fight against us and they destroyed our temple and we wereforced to flee.’‘And you went to Ethiopia?’‘Not straight away. Our forefathers passed first into Sudan, through Meroe,where they remained for a short while. But they were driven out by another war.Then they split into two parties: one group went following the Takazze river;the other group following the Nile. And in this way they arrived in Ethiopia, inQuara, close to Lake Tana. There we made our homes. There we became Ethiopians.And because we were far from Israel, though we had stayed in touch withJerusalem all the time that we were in Egypt and in the Sudan, we now lost thatcontact and it became to us only a memory.’I next asked Hadane whether there was any place in the Lake Tana area that theFalashas regarded as being particularly important or sacred.‘Three places,’ he replied. ‘The first, the most important, is Tana Kirkos, thesecond is Daga Stephanos, the third is Zegie.’I raised my eyebrows: ‘Why is Tana Kirkos the most important?’‘I do not know exactly. But all our people regard it as sacred.’My last question was a specific one about the Ark: ‘Ethiopian Christians saythat they have the Ark of the Covenant at Axum – the original Ark of theCovenant that was supposed to have been brought from Jerusalem by Menelik, sonof the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. You’ve told me that you don’t believethe Menelik story. But do you believe that the Christians have the Ark as theyclaim?’‘Our people believe, and I myself also believe, that the Ark of the Covenant isin Axum. As a matter of fact, some years ago, I and others of our spiritualleaders went from our home to Axum to try to see the Ark for ourselves. We werevery interested in this tradition and we wanted to see the Holy Ark. So we wentthere, and we got to Axum, and to the church of Saint Mary. But we were toldthat it was forbidden for us to enter the chapel where the Ark is, because if wewere to enter into there we would die. So we said, “OK. We will purify ourselvesand then we will go in there and we will see.” So we did that, we purifiedourselves, but still the Christian priests would not permit us to enter thechapel. Because of that we had to return to our place without seeing it.’‘I’ve heard that it is brought out in public once a year, at the ceremony ofTimkat. You would have had a better chance of seeing it if you had gone there atTimkat.’Hadane laughed bitterly: ‘I have heard that too. But I do not believe that theChristians would ever bring out the true Ark. They would not do that. They willnever show it to anyone. They will use a replica instead. Do you know why?Because they took the Ark from us long, long ago, and they do not want to giveit back. They are jealous of it. So therefore they keep it always concealed inits chapel, surrounded by bars, where no one may approach it other than the onewho is appointed as its guardian.’When I finally left the Falasha Absorption Centre at Mevasserit Zion andreturned to downtown Jerusalem my head was literally buzzing with ideas andquestion. Of all the Ethiopian Jews whom I had talked to during the course of myresearch, Hadane had proved to be by far the most lucid and the mostinformative. The story of his attempt to see the Ark in Axum had intrigued me.And the special importance that he had accorded to the island of Tana Kirkos wassurely of great significance in the light of what I myself had learnt thereduring my trip in November 1989. But what had interested me most of all abouthis answers was the reference that he had made to the existence, at some remoteperiod in history, of a Jewish temple at Aswan. If there was any truth to thisthen I would certainly have to go to that Upper Egyptian town, which lay sometwo hundred kilometres to the south of Karnak and Luxor.Back in my hotel room I dialled the number of Dr Shalva Weil, the socialanthropologist who had put me in touch with Hadane.‘How did the interview go?’ she asked breezily.‘Very well, thank you. Most helpful. I’m grateful to you for the contact.’I paused awkwardly. I always feel slightly silly putting completely idioticquestions to academics. But there was no getting around this one. I had to ask:‘During our interview Hadane mentioned something to me about a temple – a Jewishtemple – at Aswan in Egypt. I know what I’m going to say next is a bit nuts, butI’ve learnt not to dismiss folk-traditions completely without at least checkingthem out. Anyway, what I want to ask you is this: is there actually anypossibility that such a temple could ever have existed?’‘Certainly it existed,’ Dr Weil replied. ‘It was a proper temple, dedicated toYahweh. But it wasn’t actually in Aswan proper. It stood on the island ofElephantine in the middle of the Nile. There are some archaeological excavationsgoing on there right now, as a matter of fact.’‘And this island … I mean … is it far from Aswan?’‘Not more than two hundred metres in a straight line. It takes about fiveminutes to sail there in a felucca.’‘So effectively Hadane was right when he talked about a temple at Aswan?’‘Absolutely right, yes.’‘But does this temple have anything to do with the Falashas?Hadane said that it had been built by his forefathers.’‘It’s possible, I suppose. Academics are divided on the issue. Most of usbelieve that the Falashas are the descendants of Jewish merchants and settlerswho reached Ethiopia from south Arabia. But there is one respectable body ofopinion which holds that they are descended from the Jews who fled fromElephantine.’‘Fled? Why?’‘Their temple was destroyed – some time in the fifth century BC I believe – andthe Jewish community that had lived on the island vanished after that. It’s abit of a mystery, actually. They just melted away. But I’m not an expert … I canrecommend some books if you like.’I thanked Dr Weil for this offer, jotted down the short bibliography that shegave me, and said goodbye to her in a state of some excitement. It had been inthe fifth century BC, according to the Tana Kirkos traditions, that the Ark ofthe Covenant had arrived in Ethiopia. Now I knew that a Jewish temple on theupper Nile had been destroyed in that same century. Was it not possible thatthat temple had been built two hundred years earlier to house the Ark after ithad been removed from Jerusalem during the reign of Manasseh?I intended to find out and left Israel the next day – not for London, as I hadoriginally planned, but for Egypt."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16DOOR OF THE SOUTHERN COUNTRIESAswan is located on the east bank of the Nile at a point roughly equidistantfrom Israel and from the northern borders of Ethiopia. Well placed as a stagingpost between the African and Mediterranean worlds, its name was derived from theGreek word Seyene, which in turn was a corruption of the ancient EgyptianSwenet, meaning ‘making business’.1[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts1] In antiquity the town profitedgreatly from a rich two-way commerce in which manufactured goods flowedsouthwards from the high civilization of Egypt, and in which spices, aromaticsubstances, slaves, gold and ivory from sub-Saharan Africa were traded north. Itwas from this latter commodity, ivory, that the island in which I was interestedhad received its name, for Elephantine (which lies in the middle of the Niledirectly opposite Aswan) had once been known simply as Abu, or Elephant Land.2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts2]At the reception desk of the New Cataract Hotel in Aswan I enquired aboutElephantine and particularly about its Jewish temple. Shalva Weil had alreadytold me that it had been destroyed in the fifth century BC but she had also saidthat archaeologists were working there, so I hoped very much that there might beruins to visit.Mention of the word ‘Jewish’ did not elicit a favourable response from the hotelstaff; despite the relatively positive diplomatic relationship that had beenforged between Egypt and Israel in recent years I had forgotten how much badblood and bitterness still divided the peoples of the two neighbouringcountries. Finally, however, I did manage to extract the following intelligencefrom the front-desk manager: ‘Many temples on Elephantine – Egyptian, Roman,maybe Jewish … I don’t know. You can go see, take a felucca ride, find out.Anyway there are archaeologists there, German archaeologists. Just ask for MrKaiser.’Mr Kaiser, eh, I thought as I walked out of the lobby and into a fiercely hotday, a likely story!INDIANA JONESAfter a short felucca ride to Elephantine I was shown to a building on theisland’s west bank where I was told ‘the Germans’ lived. I made my way to thefront door, knocked, and was admitted by a Nubian manservant wearing a red fez.Without questioning me he led me along a corridor and into an interesting room,the walls of which were lined from floor to ceiling with wooden shelves loadedwith broken fragments of pottery and other artefacts. Then he turned to go.I coughed: ‘Excuse me. Er … I’m looking for Mr Kaiser. Could you call himplease?’The servant paused, favoured me with an inscrutable stare and then left, stillwithout saying anything.Five minutes or so passed, during which I stood dithering in the middle of thefloor, and then … Indiana Jones appeared in the doorway. Or, rather, not IndianaJones himself but a Harrison Ford lookalike. Wearing a Panama hat at a jauntyangle, he was tall and muscular, ruggedly handsome, and gimlet-eyed. Clearly hehad not shaved for several days.I resisted a strong urge to exclaim, ‘Mr Kaiser, I presume’, and asked lesstheatrically: ‘Are you Mr Kaiser?’‘No. My name is Cornelius von Pilgrim.’ He advanced towards me, and, as Iintroduced myself, he extended a strong and suntanned right hand for me toshake.‘I’m visiting Elephantine’, I explained, ‘in connection with a project of mine.I’m interested in the archaeology of the temple here.’‘Ah ha.’‘Yes. You see I’m investigating a historical mystery … the … er … the loss of, Imean the disappearance of the Ark of the Covenant.’‘Ah ha.’‘Do you know what I mean by the Ark of the Covenant?’By now Cornelius von Pilgrim’s expression could only be described as glazed.‘No,’ he replied curtly in answer to my question.‘You do speak English do you?’ I asked. I wanted to be sure.‘Yes. Quite well.’‘Good. OK, then. The Ark. Now let’s see. You know about Moses, right?’A faint nod.‘And the Ten Commandments, carved on tablets of stone?’Another nod.‘Well, the Ark of the Covenant was the chest made of wood and gold that the TenCommandments were put in. And … er … I’m looking for it.’Cornelius von Pilgrim did not seem to be overly impressed. Then he said, withoutthe slightest trace of humour: ‘Ah ha. Like Indiana Jones you mean?’‘Yes. That’s exactly what I mean. Anyway, the reason why I’m in Elephantine isthat I was told on good authority that there was a Jewish temple here. My theoryis that the Ark, somehow, was taken to Ethiopia in ancient times. So naturallyI’m wondering whether there is any possibility – or any archaeological evidenceeven – that it might have been brought here first before it went to Ethiopia.You see, I think it was removed from Jerusalem in the seventh century BC. So thequestion is – what happened in the intervening two hundred years?’‘You are wondering whether during those two centuries the Ark could have beenkept in the Jewish temple on this island?’‘Absolutely. In fact I’m hoping that you and your team may have excavated thetemple. If you have then I’d very much like to know what you found.’Cornelius von Pilgrim removed his hat before demolishing my hopes. ‘Yes,’ hesaid after a rather lengthy pause, ‘but on the site that you are interested inthere’s nothing to be seen. We’d thought there might be something left … beneaththe ruins of the Roman temple that was later built on top of the Jewish one. Butnow we’ve dug down all the way through the foundations. And there’s justnothing. Absolutely nothing at all. It’s a fact that there was a substantialJewish settlement here between the seventh and the fifth century BC but nothingremains of it now for archaeology except some of the houses of the people.That’s all, I’m afraid.’Trying to ignore the immense feeling of depression that had just washed over meI asked: ‘If nothing remains of the temple then how do you know that it was everthere?’‘Oh. That is not a problem. That is not in doubt. For a while there was a greatdeal of correspondence between this island and the city of Jerusalem. Theseletters were written on ostraca – potsherds – and on papyrus scrolls. Many ofthem have been found and translated and a large number make specific referenceto the Temple of Yahweh on Elephantine. The matter is well attested historicallyand because of this we do know, within a few metres, the exact site of thetemple, we also know when the temple was destroyed – it was 410 BC – and finallywe know that the later Roman temple was built in the place where the Jewishtemple had previously stood. It is all very clear.’‘Why was the Jewish temple destroyed?’‘Look … I am not an expert in these matters. I specialize in the remains fromthe second millennium BC – well before your period. To find out more detailedinformation you will have to talk to a colleague of mine who has taken a specialinterest in the Jewish colony. He is Mr Achim Krekeler.’‘Is he here now?’‘Unfortunately not. He is in Cairo. But he will return tomorrow. Will you stillbe here tomorrow?’‘Yes. I mean … I don’t have long. I have to get back to England. But I can waituntil tomorrow.’‘Good. So I suggest then that you come back tomorrow, in the afternoon, sayaround three p.m., and you will see Mr Krekeler. Meanwhile, if you like, I wouldbe happy to show you where the Jewish colony was … and the site of your temple.’I took von Pilgrim up on this kind offer. As we walked I asked him under whoseauspices the excavations on Elephantine were being conducted.‘We are from the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin,’ he replied. ‘Wehave been working here for a number of years.’We had arrived at the foot of a low hill. On the slopes above us, spread outover a wide area, was a maze of rubble and masonry, amidst which partiallyreconstructed dry-stone walls betrayed the outlines of rooms, houses andstreets. ‘This’, said von Pilgrim, ‘was the part of the old town of Elephantinewhere the Jewish people lived.’We began to climb, picking our way with care amongst the crumbling ruins. By thetime we reached the summit I was quite out of breath – but I had also shaken offthe mood of depression that had assailed me earlier. Though I could not haveexplained exactly why, I felt that there was something about this place whichwas … right – something haunting and evocative that spoke of ancient days andhidden histories.Cornelius von Pilgrim had led me to the highest point on the island ofElephantine. Now he gestured around us and said: ‘The Jewish temple was here,beneath where we are standing.’I pointed to a massive, broken column that loomed just ahead of us and to ourright and asked what it was.‘Part of the Roman temple I told you about. As a matter of fact there’s evidencethat quite a number of other temples stood here at different periods, dedicatedto the gods of the various foreign powers that occupied Egypt in the firstmillennium BC. Often the architects of these temples would re-use the materialsfrom the earlier buildings. This, I think, is why the Jewish temple socompletely disappeared. It was destroyed, knocked down, maybe burnt, and thenits masonry was broken up and incorporated into the walls of the next temple.’‘I asked before why the Jewish temple was destroyed. You didn’t get round totelling me …’‘Broadly speaking we believe that there was a problem between the members of theJewish community and the Egyptian residents of the island. You see there was anEgyptian temple too …’‘On the same site?’‘No. The Jewish temple had been built more or less beside it.’ The Egyptiantemple was over there’ – he gestured in the direction of another pile of rubble– ‘and some remains from it have been found. It was dedicated to the god Khnum.He was a ram-headed god. All his effigies show him with the head of a ram. Andwe speculate from this that some serious tension may have arisen between theJewish priests and the Egyptian priests.’‘Why tension?’‘Well, it’s obvious. It is known that the Jews here practised sacrifice andalmost certainly they sacrificed rams. This would not have made the priests ofKhnum very happy. So we guess that at a certain date they simply turned on theJews and perhaps massacred them, or perhaps expelled them from the island, andthen afterwards destroyed their temple.’‘And you said that that date was 410 BC?’‘Yes. That’s right. But you must talk to Achim Krekeler for more details.’THE MISSING LINK?I returned the next afternoon as von Pilgrim had suggested. Meanwhile I hadspent a sleepless night and a restless morning thinking through everything thatI had learned, working out the logic of events and trying to arrive at sometentative conclusions.As a result of this process – even before my meeting with Krekeler – I wasreasonably confident in my own mind that the Jewish temple on Elephantine mightindeed prove to be the missing link in the chain of clues that I had assembledover the previous two years. If I was right, and if a group of Levites had leftJerusalem with the Ark of the Covenant during the reign of Manasseh, then theycould hardly have chosen a better place of safety. Here they would have been farbeyond the reach of the wicked Jewish king who had introduced an idol into theHoly of Holies. Moreover, since I had established the relationship between theceremony of the Ark and the festival of Apet (held each year at Luxor just twohundred kilometres to the north – see chapter 12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm]), it seemed to me that this Upper Egyptianisland could also have been seen by the fugitive priests as a uniquelyappropriate location: surrounded on all sides by the sacred waters of the riverNile, might they not have felt that they had returned to their roots?All this was speculation. What was certain, however, was that a Jewish templehad been built here at approximately the right time to have sheltered the Arkafter its removal from the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem. It was also certain thatthat same temple had subsequently been destroyed during the same century inwhich – according to the Tana Kirkos traditions – the Ark had been brought toEthiopia. All this, it seemed to me, added up to a compellingly suggestiveseries of events. And I was not greatly worried by the fact that the date of theElephantine temple’s destruction – 410 BC – was approximately sixty years laterthan the date that I had calculated for the Ark’s arrival on Tana Kirkos (470BC). Over the huge period of time between the fifth century bc and the twentiethcentury AD it seemed to me quite possible that the Ethiopian oral traditions onwhich I had based that calculation could have gone adrift by sixty years or so.I was therefore in an optimistic frame of mind when I arrived back at the GermanArchaeological Institute’s house for my meeting with Achim Krekeler. A stocky,friendly man in his mid-thirties who spoke good English, I found him poring overfragments of ancient papyrus which, he explained, had to be handled with greatcare because they were exceptionally brittle.‘And it’s papyri like these that have provided the main evidence for theexistence of the Jewish temple?’‘Yes, and for its destruction. After 410 BC a number of letters were sent toJerusalem describing what had happened and seeking funds and permission for apossible reconstruction.’‘But the temple was never rebuilt, was it?’‘No, definitely not. In fact all the correspondence suddenly stopped around 400BC. After that it seems that the Jewish people left Elephantine.’‘Do you know what happened to them?’‘No. Not really. But clearly they had been in trouble with the Egyptians forsome time. Probably they were forced to leave.’‘And you don’t know where they went?’‘No information on that has ever been found.’At some length I explained to Krekeler my interest in the Ark of the Covenantand my feeling that it might have got to Ethiopia by way of Elephantine. I thenasked whether he thought that there was any possibility at all that the sacredrelic could have been brought to the island.‘Of course it is possible. Anything is possible. But I had always understoodthat the Ark was destroyed when the Temple in Jerusalem was burnt down by theBabylonians.’‘That’s the orthodox theory. But I’m fairly sure that it was taken out quitesome time before then – in the seventh century BC, during the reign of Manasseh.So one of the things that I’m hoping you’ll be able to give me is a precise datefor the building of the temple here in Elephantine.’‘I’m afraid there is no precise date. Opinions vary. But personally I would haveno difficulty in accepting that it might have been built some time in theseventh century BC. Other scholars also share that view.’‘And do you have any idea what the temple would have looked like? I know youhaven’t recovered any material artefacts but I’m wondering whether there mighthave been any hints in the papyri?’‘A few. No sacred writings as such have yet been recovered. But we have found afair amount of descriptive information about the exterior of the temple. Fromthis we can say for certain that it had pillars of stone, five gateways alsomade of stone, and a roof of cedarwood.’‘Would it have had a Holy of Holies?’‘Presumably. It was a substantial building, a proper temple. But there isinsufficient evidence to be certain whether there was a Holy of Holies or not.’We continued to talk around the subject for another hour or so. Finally,however, Krekeler announced that his time was short as he was due to return toCairo the next day and he had much to do. ‘I can lend you two of the bestacademic publications on Elephantine,’ he offered, ‘as long as you promise tobring them back tomorrow. They summarize all the main findings of the researchthat has been done here by scholars from many different countries since the turnof the century.’When I returned to my hotel I was carrying the weighty tomes that Krekeler hadmentioned. They fully repaid the long night that I spent studying them.THE ARK IN ELEPHANTINEHere is what I learned about the Jewish Temple on Elephantine – the key facts ofrelevance to my quest, as I recorded them in my notebook:1 The temple, as Krekeler told me, must have been a building of someconsiderable size. Quite a lot of information about its appearance survived inthe papyri and the archaeologists have concluded that its dimensions were ninetyfeet long by thirty feet wide.3 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts3]In old measurements this is, of course sixty cubits by twenty cubits.4[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts4] Interestingly, the Bible givesexactly the same measurements for Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem.5[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts5]2 The Elephantine Temple was roofed with cedarwood;6[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts6] so was Solomon’s Temple.7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts7]3 It seems, therefore, that Soloman’s Temple must have provided the model forthe Elephantine Temple. Since the former had originally been built toaccommodate the Ark of the Covenant, is it not probable that the latter was aswell?4 Animal sacrifice was routinely practised at the Elephantine Temple – includingthe all-important sacrifice of a lamb as the opening rite of Passover week.8[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts8] This is highly significant sinceit indicates that the Jewish community must have migrated to Elephantine beforethe reforms of King Josiah (640- 609 BC). Those reforms conclusively bannedsacrifice at any location other than the Jerusalem Temple (a ban that wassubsequently respected even by the exiles during the captivity in Babylon). OnElephantine, however, sacrifice continued to be an important ritual for the Jewsin the sixth and fifth centuries BC.9[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts9] Since those Jews were engaged ina regular correspondence with Jerusalem there can be no doubt that they wouldhave known about Josiah’s ban. Nevertheless, they continued to performsacrifices. They must, therefore, have felt that they had some special authorityso to do. It goes without saying that the presence of the Ark of the Covenant intheir temple would have provided them with all the authority they needed.5 In this connection it is worthy of note that the Elephantine Jews clearlythought that Yahweh resided physically in their temple: a number of papyri speakof him – in no uncertain terms – as ‘dwelling’ there.10[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts10] In ancient Israel (and duringthe wanderings in the wilderness) Yahweh was believed to reside wherever the Arkwas;11 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts11] indeed this belief onlyreally changed after the loss of the Ark had been recognized.12[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts12] When the Jews of Elephantinespoke of Yahweh as a deity who was physically present with them, therefore, itfollows that they could well have been referring to the Ark.6 The Elephantine Jews frequently spoke of the deity dwelling in their temple as‘the Lord of Hosts’ or ‘Yahweh of Hosts’.13[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts13] Scholars recognize this phraseas an archaic one.14 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts14] It wasfrequently used in connection with the Ark (e.g. in the period before Solomon’sTemple was built ‘the people sent to Shiloh that they might bring from thencethe Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of Hosts.’15[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts15]).7 All the above factors lend credibility to the view that the Ark could havebeen lodged in the Elephantine Temple – and, indeed, that its presence on theisland could have been the reason for the building of that Temple in the firstplace. Krekeler was right to tell me that no exact date of construction has yetbeen established. From the literature, however, it is clear that the scholarswho analysed the papyri did a great deal of work on precisely this subject. Theypoint out that by the early seventh century BC there was already a substantialJewish population on the island of Elephantine, made up mainly of a garrison ofmercenaries in the pay of the Egyptians. These Jewish soldiers, together withtheir families, would have constituted a viable social context for templeworship. On the basis of this and a great deal of other evidence, the consideredopinion of the scholars is therefore that the Elephantine Temple must have beenbuilt by the year 650 BC.16 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts16]8 It is impossible to overstate the significance of this date. Why? Because itfalls during the reign of Manasseh – the king who introduced an idol into theHoly of Holies of the Jerusalem Temple, thus causing the Ark to be removed(probably by priests who remained loyal to the traditional worship of Yahweh).It was a difficult enough task to establish that the sacred relic must indeedhave been taken out at this time17[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts17] – but, having completed thattask, I am satisfied that there is no evidence in the Bible about where it mighthave been taken to (even Professor Menahem Haran was unable to put forward anytheories as to what could have happened to it after it left Jerusalem).9 The academic authorities who studied the Elephantine papyri, and who arrivedat the date of 650 BC for the construction of the Temple, were clearly not awarethat the Ark could have gone missing from Jerusalem during the reign ofManasseh. If they had been then they would certainly have put two and twotogether. They were aware, however, of the widespread outrage caused by thatmonarch’s ‘pagan innovations’, and they concluded that this outrage was the onlypossible explanation for the otherwise inexplicable fact that a Jewish templewas built on Elephantine:Manasseh’s reign was accompanied by much bloodshed and it may be surmised thatpriests as well as prophets opposed his paganisation. Some of the priests fledto Egypt, joined the Jewish garrison at Elephantine, and there … erected theTemple.18 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts18]10 These are the words of Bezalel Porten, author of the authoritative studyArchives from Elephantine. Porten nevertheless remains puzzled by the fact thata Jewish temple could have been built at Elephantine at all, because of thenotion, deeply entrenched within Judaism, ‘that foreign soil was unclean andthat, therefore, no Temple to the Lord might be erected on it.’19[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts19] He points out that, after thedestruction of Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, the Jews carried off into exile inBabylon ‘were counselled by Jeremiah to settle down and pray (not sacrifice) tothe Lord.’ The same author then adds: ‘there is no evidence that any Temple toYHWH was erected in Babylonia’ and asks: ‘With what justification, then, did theJews at Elephantine erect their temple?’20[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts20]11 It seems to me that the answer to Porten’s rhetorical question is obvious:their justification was that they had brought with them from Jerusalem the Arkof the Covenant and that they now needed to build ‘an house of rest’ for it,21[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts21] just as Solomon had done so longbefore.ELEPHANTINE AND THE FALASHASWhen I returned to England I felt quite confident that I had at last uncoveredthe real sequence of events underlying the mystery of the lost Ark.Seeking supporting evidence I went to the School of Oriental and African Studiesin London and acquired copies of the two out-of-print volumes that AchimKrekeler had lent me, volumes that I now wanted to examine much more thoroughly.I also assembled other relevant sources, including The History of Herodotus(because I had learned that the famous Greek scholar had paid a visit toElephantine around the year 450 BC22[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts22]).This further research effort proved fruitful. One thing that had been botheringme, for example, was why Josiah – the zealous traditionalist who had inheritedthe throne in Jerusalem two years after Manasseh’s death – had not sought to getthe Ark back from Elephantine. The answer to that question did not provedifficult to find. As I had already established, Josiah’s reforms had notstarted until the twelfth year of his reign (when he was twenty) and hisrestoration of the Temple had only begun in the eighteenth year of his reign(622 BC).23 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts23] By this timerelations between Judah and Egypt had deteriorated dramatically – so much so, infact, that Josiah was ultimately killed fighting the Egyptians.24[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts24] Even if he had known that theArk had been taken to Elephantine, therefore, he would not have been in aposition to enforce its return from a powerful country with which he was at war.Having satisfied myself on this point I then moved on to consider the next stageof the lost history that I was attempting to reconstruct – the journey of theArk from Elephantine into Ethiopia during the fifth century BC. My interview inJerusalem with the Falasha priest Raphael Hadane had raised the intriguingpossibility that the ancestors of Ethiopia’s black Jews might have been migrantsfrom Elephantine – because there could be no doubt that he had been speaking ofthat island when he had told me that his forefathers had built a temple atAswan. Moreover the notion that the Falashas might have reached Ethiopia fromElephantine was supported by the findings of my own earlier research. InNovember 1989 I had been struck by the ‘ethnographic fingerprint’ of Falashasettlement around Lake Tana and – on the basis of this and other evidence – Ihad concluded that:the religion of Solomon could only have entered Ethiopia from the west – throughEgypt and the Sudan along the ancient and well-travelled trade routes providedby the Nile and Takazze rivers.For some time before reaching that conclusion I had been profoundly dissatisfiedwith the large body of academic opinion which held that the Falashas were thedescendants of Jews from southern Arabia who had arrived in Ethiopia after AD 70(see Chapter 6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm]). Now, as I followed up thebibliography that the social anthropologist Shalva Weil had dictated to me inJerusalem, I discovered that a number of other theories had been put forward tochallenge the prevailing orthodoxy. Though repeatedly ridiculed by the mastersof Ethiopian studies like Professor Edward Ullendorff,25[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts25] some of the dissenting voiceshad suggested that the ancestors of the Falashas could well have been convertedto Judaism by migrants from the Jewish colony on the island of Elephantine.26[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts26] No doubt there had beenextensive commercial and cultural contacts between Yemen and Ethiopia duringthis period; the reality was, however, that several quite substantial Jewishcommunities had been established in Egypt for hundreds of years before any Jewshad settled in south Arabia. Given the profoundly Old Testament character ofFalasha religion, therefore, logic suggested that the Jewish faith must havebeen carried south-eastwards from Egypt and into Ethiopia in a gradual processof ‘cultural diffusion’.27 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts27]To be sure, there were no absolutely unassailable historical facts linking theFalashas to Elephantine. I did, however, come across a great many tantalizingclues and coincidences which seemed to me to be highly suggestive of such alink. All the evidence was circumstantial and none of it actually proved mytheory that the Ark had reached Ethiopia in the fifth century BC after spendingtwo hundred years in the Jewish Temple on Elephantine. Viewed in the context ofeverything else that I had learned, however – in Israel, in Egypt and inEthiopia itself – my latest findings took on a different and entirely morepersuasive aspect.Set out below, as I recorded them in my notebook, are the principal conclusionsthat I reached and the evidence on which they were based:1 The fact that the Jewish community at Elephantine practised sacrifice – andthat it continued to do so long after King Josiah’s reforms – is surely highlysignificant. One of the proofs of the antiquity of Judaism in Ethiopia is theextremely archaic character of Falasha religion, in which animal sacrifice ofprecisely the kind carried out at Elephantine plays a crucial role.28[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts28] This adds weight to thehypothesis that the Falashas are the ‘cultural descendants’ of Jewish migrantsfrom Elephantine and therefore provides strong support for the thesis that theArk of the Covenant may have been brought to Ethiopia from that island.2 In its heyday the Jewish Temple on Elephantine had its own well establishedpriesthood. In the vowel-less language of the papyri these priests are referredto as KHN.29 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts29] This word, ofcourse, becomes kahen when the vowels ‘a’ and ‘e’ are added. Falasha priests arealso called Kahen.30 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts30]3 One of the names given to the Jewish Temple on Elephantine was MSGD.31[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts31] It meant ‘place ofprostration’.32 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts32] To this day theFalashas in Ethiopia have no synagogues; neither do they have a temple; they do,however, call their simple houses of worship Mesgid33[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts33] (i.e. MSGD with the vowels ‘e’and ‘i’ added). In this context it is also worthy of note that it was exactly ina prostrate position, knees to the ground, that King Solomon once prayed beforethe Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh.34[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts34]4 In his interview with me in Jerusalem Raphael Hadane said that the JewishTemple built by his forefathers ‘at Aswan’ had been exempted from a greatdestruction that had been inflicted upon Egyptian temples by a ‘foreign king’:‘he did not destroy our temple. So when the Egyptians saw that only the Jewishtemple was not destroyed they suspected that we were on the side of the invader.Because of this they started to fight against us and they destroyed our templeand we were forced to flee.’In 525 BC a foreign king did invade Egypt and did indeed destroy many temples.35[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts35] His name was Cambyses and he wasthe ruler of the expansionist Persian Empire that had been founded by his fatherCyrus the Great. The Elephantine papyri preserve this recollection of him:when Cambyses came into Egypt he found this [Jewish] Temple built. They [thePersians] knocked down all the temples of the gods of Egypt, but no one did anydamage to this Temple.36 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts36]The Persians remained in power in Egypt until very close to the end of the fifthcentury BC. During this period the Jews on Elephantine co-operated closely withthem. It was after their protection had been effectively removed that the JewishTemple on that island was finally destroyed.37[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts37] Raphael Hadane’s folk traditionsabout the origins of the Falashas are therefore borne out by establishedhistorical facts.5 Hadane also reported that his people especially venerated the island of TanaKirkos – the same island to which I was told the Ark had been brought in thefifth century BC. Moreover, Memhir Fisseha, the Christian priest whom Iinterviewed on that island, told me that the Ark had been kept there ‘inside atent’ for eight hundred years before being taken to Axum.38[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts38] It seems to me hardly surprisingthat a tent or ‘tabernacle’ might have been used on Tana Kirkos to shelter theArk. If my theory is correct then the Jews who brought the relic there had justexperienced the destruction of their own Temple on Elephantine and would haveknown also of the earlier destruction of Solomon’s Temple by Nebuchadnezzar.They could well have decided that it was time to abandon formal temples for everand to return to the pure tradition of the desert wanderings when the Ark hadalways been housed in a tent.6 Last but not least, Raphael Hadane told me that the ancestors of the Falashasreached Ethiopia not only by way of Aswan (i.e. Elephantine) but also that theypassed through the city of Meroe ‘where they remained for a short while’. Thesesame two places were also named by Solomon Alemu, the Falasha priest whom Iinterviewed at the village of Anbober in January 1990. Can it be a coincidencethat, after being lost to history for more than 1,500 years, the ruins of Meroewere finally unearthed by – guess who? Answer: they were discovered in 1772 bythe Scottish explorer James Bruce.39[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts39]THE LAND OF THE DESERTERSAll this, I felt, very strongly suggested that I was on the right track – andthe fact that the site of ancient Meroe had been discovered by none other thanmy old friend James Bruce only served to quicken my enthusiasm for the chase.The Scottish explorer, I was sure, had made his epic journey to Ethiopia inorder to locate the Ark of the Covenant (see Chapter 7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c07_r1.htm]). How appropriate therefore that he shouldalso have located the fabled city through which the sacred relic had passed onits journey to the Abyssinian highlands.But had it really passed that way? There was still, it seemed to me, one vitalquestion that I had not yet satisfactorily answered: why should the Jews ofElephantine have migrated to the south with the Ark of the Covenant after theyleft the island? Why not head north – back towards Israel, for example?I found that there were several possible explanations for this, all of whichcould have played a role. For a start, by the fifth century BC, the Jews inJerusalem had got used to living without the Ark. Solomon’s Temple was long goneand a new one had been built to replace it. This Second Temple, furthermore, wasadministered by an entrenched priesthood which would definitely not havewelcomed competitors from Elephantine.By the same token, the Elephantine Jews would have felt alien and out of placein the theological environment afforded by Jerusalem in the fifth century BC.Religious thinking had moved on, God was no longer thought of as thequasi-corporeal deity who had dwelled ‘between the cherubims’, and the forms ofworship in which the Ark had once occupied centre stage had been largelyabandoned.The return of the relic would, therefore, have led to many potentiallycatastrophic problems. It would have been quite obvious to the Elephantinepriesthood that in order to avoid these problems they would have to stay awayfrom Jerusalem. But where could they go instead? Clearly, they could not remainin Egypt, since the Egyptians had turned against them and destroyed theirTemple. Nor, for the same reason, could they have been sure of safe passage ifthey had chosen to travel north in order to leave that country. A logicalsolution, therefore, would have been to turn towards the south. It was notwithout good reason that the Governor of Aswan and Elephantine was titled‘Governor of the Door of the Southern Countries’.40[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts40] In order to take their preciousrelic to safety the Jews would only have needed to open that metaphorical ‘door’and head off into those ‘Southern Countries’, which were known collectively as‘Ethiopia’ – a Greek word meaning ‘burnt faces’ applied at that time to allareas in which dark-skinned people lived.41[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts41]The fugitives would by no means have been venturing forth into a terrifyingterra incognita. On the contrary, there was direct evidence that members of theJewish community had been involved in military expeditions far to the south asearly as the sixth century BC.42 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts42]Furthermore, I discovered well documented instances of previous migrations –migrations that had not necessarily involved Jews but that had seen largenumbers of people from the Aswan area travelling and settling in ‘the SouthernCountries’. For example, Herodotus, the ‘father of History’, reported that fourdays’ journey beyond Elephantine the river Nile ceased to be navigable:You will then disembark and travel along the bank for forty days, for there aresharp rocks in the Nile and many reefs through which you will be unable to sail.Having marched through this country in forty days, you will embark again inanother boat and sail for twelve days, and then you will come to a great city,the name of which is Meroe. This city is said to be the mother of allEthiopia … From this city, making a voyage of the same length of sailing as youdid from Elephantine to the mother city of the Ethiopians, you will come to theland of the Deserters … These were two hundred and forty thousand Egyptians,fighter Egyptians, who revolted from the Egyptians and joined theEthiopians … in the time of King Psammetichus. When these people had settledamong the Ethiopians, the Ethiopians became more civilised, through learning themanner of the Egyptians. For four months of travel space, then, sailing androad, beyond its course in Egypt, the Nile is a known country. If you add alltogether, you will find that it takes four months of journeying from Elephantineto these Deserters of whom I spoke.43[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts43]I said earlier that the mass exodus of ‘the Deserters’ from Elephantine had notnecessarily involved Jews, and I could find no proof that it had. Herodotus hadstated very clearly, however, that this exodus had occurred in the time of thePharaoh Psammetichus (595–589 BC44[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts44]). I was therefore excited tolearn from an impeccable source that ‘Jews had been sent out as auxiliaries tofight in the army of Psammetichus against the King of the Ethiopians.’45[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts45] On the basis of this welldocumented historical fact it did not seem unreasonable to conclude that theremight indeed have been some Jews amongst the Deserters.Another aspect of the Herodotus report which I found intriguing was that it madespecific mention of Meroe – through which, according to Raphael Hadane, theforefathers of the Falashas had passed on their way to Abyssinia. Moreover,Herodotus had gone to considerable lengths to explain that his ‘Deserters’ hadlived a full fifty-six days’ sail beyond Meroe. If this journey had been made onthe Atbara river, which flows into the Nile just to the north of Meroe (and intowhich, in turn, the Takazze also flows) then it would have brought the travelleras far as the borders of modern Ethiopia, and perhaps across those borders.46[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts46]Herodotus had written his report in the fifth century BC. It followed that if agroup of Jews bearing the Ark of the Covenant had chosen to flee southwards fromElephantine in that same century then they would have passed through ‘knowncountry’ almost all the way to Lake Tana. Moreover, simple logic suggested thatthe Abyssinian highlands could have been an attractive destination for them –cool and well watered, these green mountains would surely have looked like aGarden of Eden by comparison with the deserts of the Sudan.BEYOND THE RIVERS OF CUSHCould the fugitives from Elephantine have had foreknowledge of this ‘gardenbeyond the wilderness’? Was it possible that in making their journey to thesouth they might not only have been travelling through ‘known country’ but alsogoing towards a land in which they already had kin and co-religionists? As myresearch progressed I did find evidence to suggest that this was indeed possibleand that Jews could well have ventured into Abyssinia at dates even earlier thanthe fifth century BC.Part of this evidence was biblical. Though I knew that the use of the word‘Ethiopia’ in the Scriptures could not automatically be assumed to refer to thecountry now going by that name, I also knew that there were circumstances inwhich it might have done. As noted above, ‘Ethiopia’ is a Greek word meaning‘burnt faces’. In the earliest Greek editions of the Bible, the Hebrew term‘Cush’ was translated as ‘Ethiopia’ and was used to refer, as one leadingauthority put it, to ‘the entire Nile Valley south of Egypt, including Nubia andAbyssinia’.47 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts47] What this meantwas that biblical references to ‘Ethiopia’ might or might not refer to Abyssiniaproper. Likewise, in English translations that had reverted to the use of theword ‘Cush’, Abyssinia might or might not have been implied.In this context it seemed to me at least worthy of note that Moses himself hadmarried an ‘Ethiopian woman’48 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts48] –according to an undeniably ancient verse in the book of Numbers. Added to thiswas the curious testimony of the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus – supportedby several Jewish legends – which asserted that between his fortieth andeightieth years the prophet had lived for some time in ‘Ethiopia’.49[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts49]Other passages in the Scriptures also referred to ‘Ethiopia’/‘Cush’. Many wereplainly irrelevant to my interests. Some, however, were intriguing and raisedthe possibility that the scribes responsible for them had not had Nubia or anypart of the Sudan in mind but rather the mountainous land in the Horn of Africathat we call ‘Ethiopia’ today.One such, with which I was already familiar, occurred in the second chapter ofthe book of Genesis and referred to the rivers that flowed out of the Garden ofEden: ‘And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseththe whole land of Ethiopia.’50 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts50] Aglance at a map showed me that there was a very real sense in which the BlueNile, sweeping out from Lake Tana in a wide loop, did indeed compass ‘the wholeland of Ethiopia’. Moreover, as I had been aware for some time,51[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts51] the twin springs regarded as thesource of that great river are known to this day as Giyon by the Ethiopiansthemselves.52 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts52]Another interesting passage occurred in Psalm 68, described by Jon D. Levenson,Associate Professor of the Hebrew Bible in the Divinity School of the Universityof Chicago, as ‘one of the oldest pieces of Israelite poetry’.53[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts53] This psalm included a crypticreference to the Ark of the Covenant54[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts54] and also made the followingstrange prediction: ‘Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.’55[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts55] I could not help but wonder whyEthiopia had been given prominence in this way as a likely candidate forconversion to the religion of Israel. Unfortunately, there was nothing in thepsalm itself which helped to answer this question. However, in a passage writtensomewhat later by the prophet Amos (whose ministry lasted from 783 to 743 BC56[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts56]), there were indications thatsomething so momentous had happened in Ethiopia/Cush that the inhabitants ofthat distant land were now to be regarded as being on a par with the ‘ChosenPeople’ of Israel. Three different translations of the same verse (Amos 9:7)help to illustrate what I mean:Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saiththe Lord. (King James Authorized Version) Are not you and the Cushites all thesame to me, sons of Israel? – it is Yahweh who speaks. (Jerusalem Bible) Are notyou Israelites like Cushites to me? says the Lord. (New English Bible)While I realized that it would be possible to interpret this verse in anotherway – i.e. to understand from it that the children of Israel were no longer tobe accorded any special privileges by Yahweh – it seemed to me that the moreobvious reading also had to be considered. By the eighth century BC, when Amoswas prophesying, was it not conceivable that there could already have been aflow of Hebrew migrants southwards through Egypt and into the highlands ofAbyssinia? There was no proof for this admittedly wild speculation. It was anundeniable fact, however, that out of all the vast swathe of territory that Amoscould have been referring to when he spoke of Ethiopia/Cush, only one specificarea was known to have adopted the Judaic faith in antiquity (and, moreover, tohave adhered to that faith right up until the twentieth century AD). That area,of course, lay in the vicinity of Lake Tana, the Falasha homeland since timeimmemorial.The next biblical passage that caught my attention was in the book of Zephaniah,and had been written at some time between 640 and 622 BC57[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts57] – i.e. during the reign of KingJosiah. Again I found it helpful to view side by side three separatetranslations of the same verse (Zephaniah 3:10), which supposedly quoted thewords of the Lord:From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of mydispersed, shall bring mine offering. (King James Authorized Version) Frombeyond the banks of the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants will bring meofferings. (Jerusalem Bible) From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants of theDispersion shall bring me tribute. (New English Bible)Since there was absolutely no doubt that this verse had been written before 622BC – and thus well before the exile and captivity of the Israelites in Babylon –it was pertinent to ask the following questions:1 When Zephaniah had referred to a ‘dispersion’ what event exactly had he beentalking about?2 Which part of biblical ‘Cush’ had he had in mind when he had envisaged thesuppliants of the Lord bringing offerings ‘from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia’?In answer to the first question, I had to conclude that the prophet had beentalking about some kind of voluntary popular migration, because there had beenno enforced ‘dispersion’ of the Hebrews from the Holy Land prior to Zephaniah’stime. As regards the second question, the reader will recall that the biblicalterm ‘Cush’ connoted ‘the entire Nile Valley, south of Egypt, including Nubiaand Abyssinia’. The verse quoted above, however, contained internal evidencewhich helped to narrow down the precise geographical area that Zephaniah hadbeen speaking of. That evidence lay in the phrase variously translated as‘beyond the rivers of Ethiopia’. Since more than one river was involved, theNile Valley as far south as Meroe could be ruled out. East of Meroe, however,flowed the Atbara, and beyond that the Takazze, while to the south (roughlyparallel to the Atbara) the Blue Nile rushed down from Abyssinia. These, surely,were the rivers of Ethiopia, and beyond all of them lay Lake Tana. Thepossibility that the prophet had had the traditional area of Falasha settlementin mind when he had written this intriguing verse could not, therefore, beentirely dismissed.My feeling that there might be something to this speculation strengthened when Iran a computer check and discovered that the phrase ‘beyond the rivers ofEthiopia/Cush’ had only been used on one other occasion in the entire Bible. TheKing James Authorized Version translated the relevant passage (from Chapter 18of the book of Isaiah) as follows:Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon thewaters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to apeople terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and troddendown, whose land the rivers have spoiled!58[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts58]The other translations of the same passage, which I reproduce below side byside, added further shades of meaning to an already rich and haunting message:Country of whirring wings beyond the rivers of Cush, who send ambassadors bysea, in papyrus skiffs over the waters. Go, swift messengers to a people talland bronzed, to a nation always feared, a people mighty and masterful, in thecountry criss-crossed with rivers. (Jerusalem Bible) There is a land of sailingships, a land beyond the rivers of Cush which sends its envoys by the Nile,journeying on the waters in vessels of reed. Go, swift messengers, go to apeople tall and smooth-skinned, to a people dreaded near and far, a nationstrong and proud, whose land is scoured by rivers. (New English Bible)Falling as it did in Chapter 18 of the book of Isaiah, it was certain that thispassage had been written by Isaiah himself.59[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts59] This meant, of course, that itcould be accurately dated to his lifetime which, as I already knew,60[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts60] had been a long one, spanningthe reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah (respectively 740–736 BC, 736–716 BC and716–687 BC61 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts61]). In fact, theprophet had almost certainly survived into the reign of Manasseh, the monarchwhose idolatry, I was now quite certain, had led to the removal of the Ark ofthe Covenant from the Holy of Holies of the Jerusalem Temple. I was thereforeinterested to learn of a strong and ancient Jewish tradition which held thatIsaiah had died a martyr at the hands of Manasseh himself.62[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts62]What I found even more interesting was the way in which the prophet had spokenof the mysterious land that lay ‘beyond the rivers of Cush’. The King JamesAuthorized Version of the Bible suggested that he had cursed this land but themore recent translations conveyed no such impression. All three renderings,however, did agree on its geographical character: not only was it located‘beyond’ rivers, but also it was itself ‘spoiled’, or ‘scoured’, or‘criss-crossed’ by rivers.In my view, this information made it virtually certain that Isaiah had beenreferring to Abyssinia and to the area of traditional Falasha settlement there.The high country around Lake Tana is indeed ‘criss-crossed’ by rivers (whichalso spoil and scour it by carrying away huge quantities of its precioustop-soil). There were other clues as well:1 The inhabitants of the land were said to be tall and ‘peeled’, or‘smooth-skinned’, or – in the authoritative Jerusalem Bible translation –‘bronzed’. This, I thought, was a description that could easily be applied tomodern Ethiopians, whose glowing, chestnut-brown complexions are quite distinctfrom the ‘black’, negroid skin tones found in other African countries.2 The land was curiously described as ‘shadowing with wings’ (or more directlyas a ‘country of whirring wings’). This, I felt, might very well be a referenceto the giant locust swarms that, every decade or so, lay waste Ethiopia,overshadowing the fields of the peasants and filling the air with a dry whirringsound that sends shivers down the spine.3 Finally Isaiah had made specific mention of the fact that the messengers ofthe land travelled in ‘vessels of bulrushes’ or in ‘papyrus skiffs’, or in‘vessels of reed’. To this day, as I was very well aware, those who dwell aroundthe vast inland sea of Lake Tana make extensive use of papyrus-reed boats knownas tankwas.63 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts63]All in all, therefore, I felt that the biblical data did lend a considerabledegree of credibility to the view that some kind of relationship might have beenestablished between Israel and the Abyssinian highlands at a very early date.Moses’s Ethiopian wife, Isaiah’s ‘people tall and bronzed’, and Zephaniah’s‘dispersed’ suppliants – who would return to Jerusalem ‘from beyond the riversof Cush’ – all made it very difficult to resist the suspicion that Hebrews hadbeen travelling to Ethiopia, and probably settling there, long before the fifthcentury BC. If, as I suspected, the Jewish priests of Elephantine had broughtthe Ark of the Covenant to the island of Tana Kirkos in that same century thenit followed that they would have been coming to a land in which theirco-religionists had already established a secure foothold.WAVES OF MIGRATION?Outside the Bible was there any evidence at all which might support thishypothesis? I felt that there was. The research that I myself had conducted inEthiopia during 1989–90, for example, had already raised the possibility thatthere might have been successive waves of Hebrew migration over an immense spanof time extending back into the remotest antiquity. Most strongly suggestive ofthis had been the long interview that I had conducted with Wambar Muluna Marsha,High Priest of the ‘Hebraeo-Pagan’ Qemant (see Chapter 11[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c11_r1.htm]). He had told me that Anayer, the founderof his religion, had come to the Lake Tana area from ‘the land of Canaan’. WhenI had made a closer examination of Qemant religion I had established that itcontained a peculiar mixture of pagan and Jewish practices – the latterreflected particularly in the distinctions between ‘clean’ and ‘unclean’ foods –coupled with a reverence for ‘sacred groves’ which bore a close resemblance tothe very earliest forms of Judaism (the patriarch Abraham had ‘planted a grovein Beersheba,’ and had ‘called there on the name of the Lord’.64[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts64] Such tendencies had probablybeen quite widespread during the early period of Israelite settlement in Canaan,and had enjoyed a brief resurgence during Manasseh’s reign, but had beenthoroughly and finally stamped out by King Josiah in the seventh century BC.The implication was that the forefathers of the Qemant must have migrated toEthiopia from Canaan at a very early date. By contrast the Falashas looked likethe descendants of slightly more recent migrants. Their religion includedcertain practices also banned by King Josiah – notably animal sacrifice at localshrines – but otherwise looked like a rather pure form of Old Testament Judaism(and was certainly not adulterated with any obviously pagan beliefs).Neighbours in the mountains and valleys around Lake Tana, the Qemant and theFalashas maintained that they were related to each other (Wambar Muluna Marshahad told me that the founding family of his religion and the founding family ofthe Falasha religion had travelled ‘on the same journey’ and had discussed apossible marriage alliance – which they had ultimately failed to make).Such folklore, as I subsequently established, did reflect an ethnographic truth.The Falashas and the Qemant were indeed relatives: both were sub-sections of thegreat Agaw tribe of western central Ethiopia65[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts65] – an ethnic group considered torepresent the oldest stratum of population in the Horn of Africa.66[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts66] Because of this, themother-tongue of both peoples was a dialect of Agaw, classified, interestinglyenough, as belonging to the ‘Cushitic’ group of languages.67[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts67] Semitic tongues related toHebrew and Arabic (for example, Amharic and Tigrigna) were also present inEthiopia but were not spoken (except as second languages) either by the Falashasor by the Qemant.The explanation for this anomaly, and the deductions that flowed logically fromit, seemed to me to be obvious. I wrote in my notebook:The first small bands of Hebrews must have begun to migrate from Israel toEthiopia a very long time ago. I suspect that this process started as early asthe tenth century BC (perhaps even earlier) and that it continued at least untilthe end of the fifth century BC. On their arrival in the Lake Tana area themigrants would have found themselves amongst the oldest-established inhabitantsof Ethiopia – such as the Agaw – and would have intermarried with them, thusgradually losing their own distinct ethnic identity. At the same time, however,they would have passed on the Judaic faith and culture that they had broughtwith them. In this fashion, by say the second or first century BC, there wouldhave been no more ‘Hebrews’ as such living in Ethiopia, only ‘Hebraized’ or‘Judaized’ peoples who to all other intents and purposes would have looked likenative Ethiopians and who would, of course, have spoken a native Ethiopianlanguage (Hebrew having long since been forgotten). The modern descendants ofthese ‘Hebraized’ or ‘Judaized’ peoples are the Qemant and the Falashas – theblack Jews of Ethiopia – and their mother-tongue, a dialect of Agaw, is indeed anative Cushitic language.And what about the ‘Semitic’ peoples of Ethiopia such as the politicallydominant Christian Amharas? Almost certainly they are, as the ethnographersmaintain, the descendants of Sabaean/South Arabian settlers who moved into thehighlands in separate and somewhat later waves of immigration. Judaism in oneform or another was probably quite well established amongst indigenous Agawgroups by the time that these Sabaean conquerors arrived – which would explainwhy their cultures, too, were gradually ‘Judaized’ and why Judaic elementssurvive to this day in the curiously Old Testament character of AbyssinianChristianity.‘There were always Jews in Ethiopia, from the beginning,’ wrote the PortugueseJesuit Balthaza Tellez in the seventeenth century.68[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts68] In this judgement he was, Isuspect, far closer to the truth than those modern scholars who ascribe arelatively late date to the arrival of Judaism – and who seem to be completelyblind to all the evidence that runs contrary to their own prejudices.THE MYSTERIOUS ‘BRS’While possessing the merit of explaining a great deal that hitherto had neverbeen properly explained, I was well aware of a potential weakness in the theorythat I had just outlined in my notebook: might it not reflect my own prejudicesrather than the facts? To be sure, it was a fact that the Falashas practised anarchaic form of Judaism; likewise it was a fact that Qemant religion containedmany ancient Hebraic elements; and in a similar fashion it was a fact that theChristianity of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church was riddled through and throughwith practices that were unmistakably Judaic in origin. But from all this was itlegitimate to conclude that there had been waves of Hebrew immigration intoEthiopia for hundreds of years before the fifth century BC – when, as Ibelieved, the Ark of the Covenant had been brought from the island ofElephantine on the upper Nile to the island of Tana Kirkos? If I was right, andif there had indeed been prior Hebrew settlement in that area, then there wouldno longer be any mystery about why Ethiopia (rather than some other country) hadbeen chosen as the last resting place of the Ark.But was I right? Thus far the evidence that I had gathered in support of myevolving theory had taken two distinctly different forms: (1) social andethnographic data about the Falashas and the Qemant, notably concerning theirreligious beliefs, their folklore and their relationships to one another; (2)clues, scattered throughout the Old Testament, which seemed to bear witness tosome kind of sustained Hebrew migration to Abyssinia in the first half of thefirst millennium BC. If there had really been such a migration, however, thensurely there would be proof of it outside the Bible and outside the observedpeculiarities of Falasha and Qemant culture? The impressionistic material that Ihad already gathered was strongly suggestive, but what I really needed in orderto make a complete case was tangible archaeological or documentary evidence ofHebrew settlement in Ethiopia prior to the fifth century BC.I had never come across such evidence and I knew that I was swimming against thecurrent of scholarly opinion in seeking for it now. Nevertheless I put outfeelers to my contacts in the academic world in an attempt to discover whetherthere was anything of importance that I might have missed.Not long afterwards I received through the mail a paper written in French by acertain Jacqueline Pirenne and published in 1989 by the Université des scienceshumaines de Strasbourg.69 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts69] Thepaper had been sent to me by a professor of Egyptology at a major Britishuniversity. In his covering note who said:Just a line to enclose a photocopy of an article by Jacqueline Pirenne, given ata recent conference in Strasburg.Frankly, from a scholarly point of view, I consider she’s gone ‘way over thetop’; she’s undoubtedly a very able person, knows her ancient Arabiandocumentation, but has (for not a few of us) improbable ideas on anc. Arabianchronology & script origin. This essay is fascinating, but more fiction thanhistory, I fear. (Beeston, I gather, criticised it heavily at a recent meetingof the Seminar for Arabian Studies; he’s pre-eminently sane, though no moreinfallible than the rest of us.)I naturally wondered why the professor should have thought that a paper bysomeone who knew her ‘ancient Arabian documentation’ could possibly be of anyrelevance to my own research. After I had had the paper translated into English,however, I could see exactly why he had thought that, and I was also able tounderstand why members of the academic establishment had reacted with hostilityto Jacqueline Pirenne’s views.To strip a rather complex thesis down to its bare essentials, the main thrust ofher argument was that scholars who had examined the historical relationshipbetween Ethiopia and South Arabia had been completely wrong: far from Sabaeaninfluences reaching Ethiopia from the Yemen, as had previously been supposed,the flow had in fact been in the opposite direction, in other words fromEthiopia to South Arabia:The Sabaeans … arrived first of all in Ethiopian Tigray and entered Yemen viathe Red Sea coast … This conclusion, which is the absolute contrary to allrecognized views, is the only one … to explain the facts and do them justice.70[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts70]Pirenne then went on to demonstrate that the original homeland of the Sabaeanshad been in north-west Arabia but that large numbers of them had emigrated fromthere to Ethiopia (‘via the Hammamat river bed and along the Nile’) in twoseparate waves, the first around 690 BC and the second around 590 BC. Why hadthey emigrated? In order to avoid paying tribute to the Assyrian invaderSennacherib on the first occasion and in order to avoid paying tribute to theBabylonian conqueror Nebuchadnezzar on the second.This thesis was not as far-fetched as it sounded: during their respectivecampaigns Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar had not confined themselves to theirfamous attacks on Jerusalem; it was a fact that they had also pressed on intonorth-west Arabia, where they might indeed have encountered and displacedSabaean tribes. This much I already knew. I did not feel, however, that I was ina position either to condemn or condone the rest of Pirenne’s argument, namelythat her fugitive Sabaeans had reached Ethiopia by following the Nile Valley andthen had migrated onwards from there across the Red Sea and into the Yemen.Nor was this argument, interesting though it was, central to Pirenne’simportance for my own investigation. What caught my eye, and finally convincedme that I was on the right track, was her analysis of a Sabaean inscriptionfound in Ethiopia and dated to the sixth century BC. Translated by the linguistR. Schneider and originally published in an obscure paper entitled ‘Documentsépigraphiques de l’ethiopie’,71 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts71]this inscription honoured a Sabaean monarch who described himself as a ‘noblefighter king’ and boasted that in the empire he had established in the north andwest of Ethiopia, he had reigned ‘over Da’amat, the Sabas, and over the ‘BRs,the whites and the blacks.’72 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts72]Who were the ‘BRs, Pirenne asked:R. Schneider did not venture any interpretation … but the term, witnessed inAssyrian inscriptions – the Abirus – may be attributed to the Hebrews … It isnatural that Hebrews would have emigrated at the same time as the second wave ofSabaeans, since the first capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar … followed bydeportation to Babylon, was in 598 BC, whereas the attacks of the sameNebuchadnezzar against the Arabs were in 599–598 BC … Identification of the ‘BRsas ‘Hebrews’ who arrived [in Ethiopia] with the second wave of Sabaeansexplains … the existence of the Falashas, black but Jewish … They are thedescendants of these ‘Hebrews’ who arrived in the sixth century BC.73[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts73]What Pirenne had not given any consideration to was the possibility that the‘BRs’ – a standard way of writing the word ‘Hebrews’ (i.e. ABIRUS) in earlyalphabets lacking in vowels – might have arrived in Ethiopia before any of theSabaean incursions. She had simply deduced, because the inscription thatmentioned them had been dated to the sixth century BC, that they must havemigrated in that century. On the basis of my own research, however, I now feltvery confident in concluding that the ‘BRs’ over whom the Sabaean conquerors hadclaimed suzereinty could well have been in Ethiopia for some considerable whilebefore that – and, moreover, that their numbers were still being added to atthat time (and afterwards) by the arrival via the Nile Valley of more smallbands of Hebrew immigrants.This latter point was still in the realm of theory; Jacqueline Pirenne’s gift tome, however, lay in the fact that she had drawn my attention to definitearchaeological and documentary proof of the existence in Ethiopia, in the sixthcentury BC, of a people called the ‘BRs’. Academics might argue until eternityabout who these ‘BRs’ really were, but I myself was no longer in any doubt:• they had been Hebrews who, at that early stage, had not yet submerged theiridentity with that of the indigenous Agaw amongst whom they had settled;• they had worshipped a God called YHWH;• in consequence, when the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh was brought fromElephantine to Ethiopia in the fifth century BC there was a very real sense inwhich it could be said to have arrived in a receptive and appropriate restingplace.A CHAPEL OF MISCHANCEThere remained very little more for me to do. Throughout a long and circuitoushistorical investigation I had been trying to satisfy myself that there might begenuine merit to Ethiopia’s claim to possess the lost Ark.I had done that now. I was well aware that scholars might dispute my findings,and the conclusions that I had drawn from them – but, really, the approval ofthe ‘experts’ and the ‘authorities’ was not what I had sought during 1989 and1990. Instead my goal had been an inner one in which I alone had been the judgeand final arbiter of all the evidence and of all the arguments.The central issue had been simple: to journey to the ancient Tigrayan city ofAxum, and to the sanctuary chapel in which the Ark was supposed to lie, I wouldhave to be prepared to accept physical risks and also to overcome a profoundspiritual unease at the thought of putting myself into the hands of the TPLF –armed rebels who had good cause to hate me because of the cosy links that I hadhitherto enjoyed with the very government that they were shedding blood tooverthrow. I had not been prepared to accept those risks, or to struggle tomaster my own fears, unless I could first convince myself that in so doing Iwould be embarking on an adventure that was neither foolish nor quixotic butrather one that I could believe in and to which I could commit myself.I now did believe that there was a very high degree of probability that the Arkmight indeed lie in Axum, and I was therefore prepared to commit myselfabsolutely to the last stage of my quest – the journey to ‘the sacred city ofthe Ethiopians’ with all the risks and dangers and difficulties that that wouldentail.This was not a decision that I had arrived at lightly; on the contrary, over theprevious months, I had determinedly sought out every excuse that might possiblyhave justified the abandonment of the whole chancy project. Instead of findingsuch excuses, however, I had only stumbled upon more and more clues thatappeared to point unerringly in the direction of Axum.I had looked for alternative resting places for the Ark, but none of those thatlegend or tradition offered had seemed in the least bit likely. I had looked forproofs that the relic might have been destroyed, but no such proofs existed. Ihad established that the Kebra Nagast’s claims about Solomon, Sheba and Menelikcould not literally be true – only to discover that these same claims might wellserve as a complex metaphor for the truth. Certainly, the Ark of the Covenantcould not have gone to Ethiopia in the era of Solomon; but it was entirelyplausible that it might have made that journey later, at the time of thedestruction of the Jewish Temple that had stood on the island of Elephantine inthe upper Nile.All in all, therefore, whatever the academics might think, I knew that I hadreached the end of a long personal road and that I could not any more put off oravoid the final reckoning: if I was to preserve any sense of my own integrity,if I was not in later years to feel dishonoured and ashamed, then I would haveto do my level best to reach Axum – no matter the risks that I would have torun, no matter the demons of self-interest and cowardice that I would have toovercome. It was a cliché – perhaps one of the oldest clichés known to man – butit seemed to me that what really counted was not so much that I should attainthe sacred city but rather that I should try to get there, not so much that Ishould actually find the Ark but rather that I should find within myselfsufficient reserves of character to make the attempt.I was, in my own eyes, far from being an Arthurian knight clad in shiningarmour. Nevertheless, at this moment in my life, I had no difficulty inunderstanding why Sir Gawain, on his way to the perils that awaited him at theGreen Chapel, had chosen to ignore the siren song of the squire who had soughtto dissuade him from completing his quest and who had warned him:‘if you come there you’ll be killed … therefore good Sir Gawain … ride byanother route, to some region remote! Go in the name of God, and Christ graceyour fortune! And I shall go home again and undertake to swear solemnly, by Godand his saints as well, stoutly to keep your secret, not saying to a soul thatyou ever tried to turn tail.’74 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts74]After considering his position, Gawain had replied:‘It is worthy of you to wish for my well being, man, and I believe you wouldloyally lock it in your heart. But however quiet you kept it, if I quit thisplace, fled … in the fashion you propose, I should become a cowardly knight withno excuse whatever … I will go to the Green Chapel, to get what Fate sends.’75[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts75]With just such resolve, though with less chivalry, I was now determined that Imust go to my own ‘chapel of mischance’76[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c16-nts76] to find there whatever Fatemight send me. And, like Sir Gawain, I knew that I would have to make thatjourney at the dawn of a New Year – for the solemn feast of Timkat fastapproached."},{"pageContent":"PART VI: ETHIOPIA, 1990-91THE WASTE LAND"},{"pageContent":"[images/Hanc_9780307829047_epub_m06_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17SUPPING WITH DEVILSAfter my trips to Israel and Egypt I returned to England in October 1990 with mymind made up: I would have to go to Axum, and the optimum time to travel therewould be in January 1991. If I could arrive before the 18th of that month then Iwould be able to participate in the Timkat ceremony, during which I hoped thatthe Ark itself would be carried in public procession.Raphael Hadane, the Falasha priest whom I had interviewed in Jerusalem, haddoubted whether the genuine article would actually be used: ‘I do not believethat the Christians would ever bring out the true Ark,’ he had told me, ‘theywould not do that. They will never show it to anyone. They will use a replicainstead.’ Coming as it had from a man who had himself journeyed to Axum in thehope of seeing the sacred relic, this warning bothered me a great deal.Nevertheless I saw no alternative but to go ahead with my plan – and that meantconfronting my own fears.With Ethiopia’s civil war continuing to go against the government there would nolonger be any doubt that I would have to put myself into the hands of the TigrayPeople’s Liberation Front if I was serious about getting to Axum. Over the yearsI knew that they had taken dozens of foreigners into the areas they controlledwithout the slightest harm coming to anyone. I, however, was terribly afraidthat harm might come to me. Why?The answer to this question lay in the close links that I had established withthe Ethiopian regime over the period 1983–9. At the end of 1982 I had abandonedjournalism, my former occupation, and had set up a publishing company of my own,the purpose of which was to produce books and other documentation for a widerange of clients, including a number of African governments. One of my earliestdeals had been with the Ethiopian Tourism Commission; indeed, as reported inChapter I, it had been that deal that had taken me to Axum in the first place,way back in 1983.The result had been a coffee-table book1[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-nts1] which had been liked by seniormembers of the Ethiopian government and which had led to the commissioning ofseveral similar projects. In the process I had met and got to know many powerfulpeople: Shimelis Mazengia, the Head of Ideology, other Politburo and CentralCommittee activists including Berhanu Bayih and Kassa Kebede, and last but by nomeans least Ethiopia’s so-called ‘Red Emperor’, President Mengistu Haile Mariamhimself – the military strong-man who had seized control of the country in themid 1970s and whose reputation for ruthless suppression of dissent was virtuallywithout parallel anywhere in Africa.There is a sense in which when you work closely with people you gradually beginto see things their way. This happened to me during the 1980s and, by the secondhalf of the decade, I was one of the Ethiopian government’s staunchestsupporters. Though I never approved of that government’s use of domesticrepression, I managed quite successfully to persuade myself that particularinitiatives taken by it were justified and helpful. Notable amongst these wasthe policy of resettlement inaugurated in 1984–5 with the goal of moving morethan a million peasants from famine-stricken Tigray (then still under governmentcontrol) to virgin lands in the south and west of the country. At the time I wasconvinced that this ‘was necessary’ because vast areas of the north had become‘uninhabitable wastelands on the verge of total, irreversible ecologicalcollapse.’2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c17-nts2] The political leadersof the TPLF, however, looked at resettlement in quite a different way, seeing itas a grave threat to the rebellion that they were then desperately attempting toconsolidate. The real aim underlying this ‘sinister’ policy, they wereconvinced, was to deprive them of vital grass-roots support in their own homeregion (since, obviously, every peasant removed from Tigray represented one lesspotential recruit for the Front).By backing resettlement, therefore – and I did so publicly on a number ofoccasions – I had worked directly and explicitly against the interests of theTPLF. Moreover I had identified myself closely with the Ethiopian government inother ways as well. After several meetings with President Mengistu, for example,I had been asked to profile him for the BBC World Service. That profile, airedin 1988, had portrayed him in a far more favourable light than most peoplebelieved he deserved. What I had said had been a genuine expression of my ownviews – having got to know the man quite well I had concluded that his characterhad a great deal more depth and subtlety to it than he had ever before beengiven credit for. The end result, however, had been to make me vastly unpopularwith his legions of critics and to give the TPLF further reason to conclude thatI was firmly in the government’s camp.Finally, in 1988 and the early part of 1989, my involvement with the Addis Ababaregime had taken on a whole new dimension. In a bizarre series of journeysspread out over a period of more than a year I had carried messages back andforth between Ethiopia and neighbouring Somalia, where another African dictatorwith whom I was on friendly terms, President Mohamed Siyad Barre, was then stillin power. The purpose of these trips had been to lend support to a falteringdiplomatic peace process between the two countries, and my main role had been toreassure each head of state that his opposite number was in fact serious aboutnegotiating and subsequently respecting a proper treaty.At the time I had thought that what I was doing was honourable, worthwhile andmanifestly in a good cause. Moreover it had flattered my ego to play the part of‘honest broker’ between opponents as powerful and as dangerous as Mengistu andBarre. Such psychological inducements, however, had completely blinded me to thedownside of my activities – the extent to which the close personal relationshipsthat I was obliged to build with these cruel and calculating men might corruptand compromise my own character. There is an old proverb which recommends thatanyone planning to sup with the devil should use a long spoon. During my littleburst of amateur diplomacy in 1988 and 1989 I supped with two devils – andunfortunately I neglected to use a spoon at all.Did I emerge from the experience tainted in any way? The honest answer to thatquestion is a resounding Yes. Certainly I did. I could also add that I regret myactions and that, if I had my time over again, I surely would not allow myselfto be lured by flattery and personal ambition into such vile company.The fact was, however, that I now had to live with the consequences of my ownmistakes. One of these consequences was that the Ethio-Somali peace process inwhich I had played a part had involved an agreement by both sides to cut off allthe finance and arms that they had hitherto provided to each other’s rebelgroups. This naturally affected the interests of the TPLF who, over a period ofseveral years, had built up a substantial support-office in Mogadishu, theSomali capital. Once again, therefore, I had demonstrated myself to be an enemyof the Tigrayan cause and a friend to Mengistu Haile Mariam, the dictator whomthey regarded as the very incarnation of evil.This was the background against which, with considerable trepidation, I made myfirst overtures to the TPLF’s London office in November 1990. I expected thatthe most likely result was that they would flatly refuse my request to go toAxum. Alternatively, however, paranoia and a guilty conscience had conspired toproduce a different and even more worrying scenario in my own mind: theguerillas would agree to take me to the sacred city; then, after I had crossedthe border from Sudan into Tigray, they would arrange a fatal ‘accident’.Melodramatic and even absurd though this fear might seem, it was very real tome.QUEST OR COVER STORY?The response of the TPLF to my initial approach was underwhelming. Yes, theyknew who I was. Yes, they were surprised that I should want to go to Axum. Butno, they did not object to my plans.There was a problem, however. A visa would be required from the government ofthe Sudan before I could even fly to Khartoum. An internal travel permit fromthat same government would also be necessary to enable me to cross the hundredsof kilometres of desert between Khartoum and the Tigrayan frontier.Unfortunately neither visas nor permits were readily forthcoming for Britishcitizens in the closing months of 1990. By then a major conflict in the ArabianGulf looked unavoidable, and Sudan had thrown in its lot with Iraq. Britain, bytaking the American side, had therefore rendered its nationals virtually personanon grata in Khartoum.Didn’t the TPLF have ways to get around that ban? Yes, they told me, they did.However, they reserved their efforts for visitors who were their friends or forvisitors who could actively assist their cause. Since I was not a friend, andsince I did not appear to be offering them anything that was to their immediateadvantage, I would have to make my own arrangements with the Sudaneseauthorities. If I succeeded with that and if I could get myself as far as thefrontier town of Kassala, then the TPLF would take me across the border fromthere and would allow me to proceed to Axum.My contacts with the Sudanese Embassy in London only added to my growing senseof futility and depression. As a writer I was obliged to lodge my visa requestwith the Information Counsellor, Dr Abdel Wahab El-Affendi, who turned out to bea dapper young fellow in a suit. He told me, very politely, that I shouldabandon hope at once: in the present political climate there was absolutely nochance that I would be permitted to enter Sudan and even less that I would beallowed to travel internally from Khartoum to Kassala.‘Would it help if the TPLF supported my case?’ I asked.‘Certainly. Will they?’‘Er … not at the moment. They have other priorities.’‘Well, there you are,’ sighed Dr Affendi with the air of a man who has justproved his point, ‘you’re wasting your time.’I asked: ‘Would you mind forwarding my application to Khartoum anyway?’The Information Counsellor smiled broadly and turned both his hands palmsupwards in an eloquent gesture of insincere apology: ‘I will be happy to dothat, but I assure you that no good will come of it.’Throughout the month of November I stayed in touch with Dr Affendi by telephone.He had no news for me. And after my first discussion with the TPLF on 2 NovemberI went back to see them again on the 19th, this time for a meeting with TewoldeGebru, their head of mission. During that meeting I had the sense that mymotives were being skilfully probed by a clever negotiator whose aim was to findout whether I could be taken at face value or whether my real reason for wantingto go to Axum might not have more to do with the military ambitions of the AddisAbaba regime.Of course, I knew that I was only interested in the Ark of the Covenant. Not forthe first time, however, it occurred to me that my so-called ‘quest’ couldeasily look to the TPLF like the cover story of a spy. I was therefore not surewhether I should be elated or alarmed when, at the end of our conversation,Tewolde told me that he would ask the Front’s Khartoum office to facilitate myvisa and travel permit applications.A DEALDuring the next three weeks I heard nothing further from the TPLF or from theSudanese Embassy in London. A stalemate seemed to have set in and I began torealize that I was going to have to do something to force the pace.The idea that I finally came up with was very simple. It was clear that anintense propaganda campaign was being waged alongside the war on the ground inEthiopia. As part of this campaign the government had accused the TPLF –probably wrongly – of looting and burning churches. I therefore decided that Imight have a chance of securing the rebels’ co-operation if I could offer themthe prospect of a television news report about religious freedom in Tigray undertheir administration – a report in which they would be given the opportunity torefute the allegations that had been levelled against them.I did not want to make a public statement in the media in favour of the TPLF –partly because of a residual sense of loyalty to people in the government likeShimelis Mazengia who had helped me over the years, and partly because I foundthe prospect of a complete volte face distasteful. It was true that my views onEthiopia’s political problems had already changed, and that they were stillchanging. Nevertheless to stand up and support the TPLF now just because Ineeded to get to Axum was precisely the sort of behaviour that, in recentmonths, I had come to despise most in myself.The solution that I had thought up to get around this problem was, however,almost equally devious. I would not make or present the television news reporton Tigray. I would get someone else to do it for me.The person whom I had in mind was an old friend, a former BBC producer namedEdward Milner who had gone freelance some years previously. He had recently comeback from the South American country of Colombia where he had filmed a specialreport for Britain’s Channel 4 News. I therefore thought there was a good chancethat he might be interested in doing a story on Tigray for the same outlet. Ofcourse there could be no question of steering him in any particular direction. Iknew him to be a man of integrity and I knew that he would insist on completeeditorial freedom to film and report exactly what he saw in the field.Nevertheless I thought that the TPLF might show more interest in my applicationto go to Axum if, by this device, I could connect my own proposed trip to animportant piece of television coverage. All rebel groups, in my experience, arekeen on publicity and I did not think that the TPLF would prove to be anyexception.Accordingly, on Monday 10 December, I telephoned Tewolde Gebru again. When I hadmet him on 19 November he had told me that he would request the Front’s Khartoumoffice to facilitate my visa and travel permit applications. I now asked him ifthere had been any progress on this.‘None at all,’ he replied. ‘Our people in Sudan are very busy and your caseisn’t really a priority for them.’‘Would it make a difference if I was able to offer you some televisioncoverage?’‘Depends what it would be about.’‘It would be about the whole issue of religious freedom in Tigray – and aboutthe relationship between the TPLF and the church. You may be winning the war onthe ground but it seems to me that you’re losing the propaganda war …’‘What makes you say that?’‘I’ll give you an example. You’ve been accused recently of looting and burningchurches, right?’‘Yes.’‘Which presumably has done you some harm?’‘Actually it has done us a great deal of harm both with the people andinternationally.’‘And is it true?’‘No. Not true at all.’‘Nevertheless it’s been said – and once mud of that sort has been thrown ittends to stick.’ I played my trump card: ‘It’s quite obvious that it’s part of awell planned government propaganda campaign against you. Listen, let me quoteyou something from a report in The Times of 19 October.’ I had in front of me aclipping that my research assistant had given me. ‘The Ethiopian government’, Inow read, ‘particularly wants church support in its struggle against furtherdisintegration of the state. President Mengistu said recently: “Our nation isthe product of the process of history and it has existed for thousands of years.This is proved by existing historical relics.” Ironically, the President alsowants to contrast his liberalizing regime with what is perceived as thecontinuing communism and anti-clericalism of the secessionist movements …’‘I am familiar with that report,’ Tewolde interjected. ‘Any liberalization thatMengistu is doing is just a cynical measure designed to win popular support nowthat he sees that he cannot defeat us on the battlefield.’‘But that’s not really the issue. The point is that you need to do somethingabout your anti-clerical image. A proper news story televised nationally here inBritain would help you a lot. If we filmed that story at Timkat – which is whenI want to be in Axum – then the processions and the whole atmosphere would helpto demonstrate that the TPLF aren’t against the church and that you are theresponsible guardians of the most precious historical relic of all.’‘You could be right.’‘So shall I go ahead and see if I can organize some television coverage?’‘That would be a good idea.’‘And if I succeed do you think you’ll be able to arrange the visas and permitsin time?’‘Yes. I think I can guarantee that.’THE ELEVENTH HOURAfter finishing with Tewolde I got straight on the phone to my friend EdwardMilner, explained the situation to him and asked whether he was interested inoffering the Tigray story to Channel 4 News.He was interested and, by Wednesday 12 December, had secured a writtencommitment from the channel which we faxed to the TPLF together with Ed’spassport details. We also sent a covering letter saying that we would have toleave for Tigray no later than Wednesday 9 January 1991 – well ahead of Timkat.Two more weeks went by and still we had heard nothing definite from the TPLF.The visas and permits, although now forcefully requested, had simply not comethrough. ‘Check with me immediately after the New Year,’ Tewolde advised.By Friday 4 January 1991 I had given up hope entirely and was beginning toexperience an odd mixture of regret and relief: the former because I had failedto complete my quest; the latter because I had at least satisfied my own senseof honour by trying my best – and because I now seemed to be safe from all thedangers, real or imaginary, that the journey into Tigray had threatened. Then,late in the afternoon, Tewolde called: ‘You can go ahead,’ he announced,‘everything is arranged.’Ed and I flew to Khartoum on 9 January as scheduled. From there an overland trekof less than a week would bring us to the sacred city of Axum."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18A TREASURE HARD TO ATTAINEd Milner and I disembarked from the KLM Airbus that had carried us to Khartoumand stepped out into the moist embrace of an African night. We had no visas,only reference numbers given to us by the TPLF in London. These, however, wereclearly known to the immigration officer who handled our arrival and whoretained our passports while we went to collect our luggage.Married to a lovely Thai wife, and with two beautiful children, Ed was best manat my wedding and is one of my oldest friends. Short and stockily built withdark hair and angular features, he is also a consummate television professional– a veritable one-man band who produces and directs, shoots film and recordssound all by himself. These special skills, quite apart from his contacts atChannel 4, had made him an ideal choice for this trip, for while I had needed tooffer the TPLF a news story I had not wanted my own work in Axum to becomplicated by the presence of a large film crew.Ed’s full name is John Edward Douglas Milner. In the arrivals hall at KhartoumAirport, therefore, we naturally pricked up our ears when we heard these wordsover the tannoy: ‘John Edward, John Edward, John Edward. Will Mr John Edwardplease report to Immigration Office immediately.’Ed complied and then disappeared. Half an hour later I had collected all ourluggage and had been handed my passport duly stamped by immigration. A furtherhalf an hour passed, then an hour, then an hour and a half. Finally, well aftermidnight, with all the other passengers cleared through customs and the airportvirtually deserted, my colleague surfaced again looking perplexed but cheerful.‘For some reason,’ he explained, ‘the name John Edward appears on the policeblacklist. I’ve tried to make it clear to them that I’m John Edward Milner butthey don’t seem to get the point. They’ve kept my passport. I have to come backtomorrow morning to pick it up.’The TPLF had sent a car to the airport to meet us. Its driver, who spoke noEnglish, whisked us through the deserted streets of Khartoum, stopping every fewminutes at road blocks manned by loutish, heavily armed soldiers whoilliterately examined the laissez passer that he carried.I had been in the Sudan before – indeed, between 1981 and 1986 I had visited thecountry regularly. I was immediately aware, however, that much had changed sincethen. For a start it was clear from the road blocks that there was now astrictly enforced curfew, something that would have been unheard of in the olddays. Also, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, the atmosphere feltdifferent. There was an eerie quality about the blackened buildings, thelitter-strewn alleyways, and the roaming packs of stray dogs. Always a mess,Khartoum tonight felt ugly and out-of-joint in a way that was entirely new tome.We had arrived in the centre of the city and presently we turned right on to theShariah-el-Nil, just to the north of the imposing Victorian palace where, in theyear 1885, General Charles Gordon was killed by the Mahdi’s dervishes.Shariah-el-Nil means ‘Nile Street’ or ‘Nile Way’ and we were, indeed, nowdriving alongside that great river. Overhead a canopy of Neem trees blotted outthe stars while to our right, glimpsed between the thick trunks and hangingbranches, the Nile itself could be seen flowing sedately towards distant Egypt.On our left we passed the vacant terrace of the Grand Hotel, once an elegantmeeting place, now looking rather seedy and run-down. Soon afterwards we came toa last check-point at a roundabout, and here the driver was once again obligedto produce his laissez passer. Then we were waved on to the spit of land at theconfluence of the Blue and White Niles where the Khartoum Hilton stands. As wepulled into the hotel’s well lit courtyard I was looking forward very muchindeed to two or perhaps three double vodkas, tonic and a bucket of ice. When Ilater attempted to order these items from room service, however, I was remindedof an important fact that I had forgotten: since the adoption of Islamic law inthe mid-1980s, alcohol had been banned in the Sudan.The next morning, Thursday 10 January, Ed and I took a taxi to the offices ofthe Relief Society of Tigray, where the TPLF in London had told us to report tomake the final arrangements for our trip. Our names, we noticed, were scrawledin chalk on a blackboard in an upstairs room; however no one there seemed toknow anything else about us. Neither was it immediately possible to make contactwith Haile Kiros, TPLF head of mission in Khartoum: always unreliable, thecity’s telephone system appeared to have broken down entirely that morning.‘Can’t we just drive over to the TPLF office?’ I asked one of the RESTofficials.‘No. Better you stay here. We will find Haile Kiros for you.’By mid-morning there was no news. We decided that I should stay put to wait forHaile Kiros and that Ed should go to the airport in the taxi to collect hispassport. He did this. Two hours later, however, he had failed to return andthere was still no sign of the TPLF official, or indeed of anyone who appearedto be even remotely interested in me or my plans to get to Axum.The silver lining to this particular cloud, I reflected, was that such alaid-back attitude did not lend credibility to my paranoid fancies that I mightbe murdered in Tigray. Indeed, a much more realistic prospect was beginning tosuggest itself to me, namely that all concerned could turn out to be toocomatose and slow-moving to get me to Tigray at all.I looked at my watch and found that it was after one o’clock. In less than anhour, I remembered, all offices in Khartoum would close down for the day,probably including those of REST and the TPLF. Tomorrow, Friday, was the Islamicsabbath. It was therefore clear that nothing very much was going to happenbefore Saturday 12 January.And where was Ed? Perhaps he had gone directly back to the Hilton. I tried totelephone the hotel but of course could not get through. Feeling increasinglyirritated I wrote a note for Haile Kiros giving him my room number and askinghim to contact me. I then handed this note to one of the friendly young peoplemanning the REST office and walked out on to the street in search of a taxi.First I went back to the Hilton, but Ed was not there. Then, just in case, Iwent to REST again, but he was not there either. Finally I ordered my driver totake me to the airport – where, with much patient inquiry, I managed toestablish that my colleague had been detained and was being ‘interviewed’ by thepolice.Could I go in and see him?No.Could I get any further information at all?No.When might he reappear?‘Today, tomorrow, maybe Saturday,’ explained the English-speaking businessmanwho had kindly assisted me. ‘Nobody knows. Nobody will say. It is the NationalSecurity Police who are holding him. Very bad men. Very impossible for you to doanything.’By now genuinely concerned, I hurried over to the airport information kioskwhich – amazingly – was open. There, not without some difficulty, I obtained thetelephone number of the British Embassy. Then I found a public telephone whichactually worked and, moreover, was free of charge. Unfortunately, however, noone answered at the other end.Two minutes later I was in my taxi again. The driver did not know where theEmbassy was – although he had claimed otherwise – and eventually located it by acurious process of trial and error which took slightly more than an hour.I spent what was left of the afternoon back at the airport with two Britishdiplomats whom I had found drinking illegal substances at the Embassy club.These officials, however, were no more successful than I had been inestablishing why – or even where – Ed was being held. Their efforts, moreover,were complicated by the fact that Yasser Arafat, leader of the PalestineLiberation Organization, had just arrived in a Libyan jet to discuss the Gulfcrisis with Sudan’s military dictator, General Omar el-Bashir. Bristling withautomatic weapons, platoons of soldiers roamed around giving vent to patrioticanti-Western feelings and generally making life unpleasant for everyone. Neitherwere my two diplomats in a particularly good mood. ‘All British citizens havebeen warned to stay away from this bloody country,’ one of them reminded me witha faint note of accusation in his voice. ‘Now perhaps you can see why.’Around nine that evening, with Ed still not rescued, I was dropped back at theHilton for dinner. Then, just after ten, to my great relief he appeared in thelobby looking a little grimy and tired but otherwise none the worse for wear.He held up his hands as he sat down at my table. They were covered with blackink. ‘I’ve been finger-printed,’ he explained. He then attempted – fruitlessly –to order a large gin and tonic. Finally, with only minimal disgruntlement, hesettled for a warm non-alcoholic beer.ON THE ROADAs it turned out, Ed had not been held by the dreaded National Security Policebut by the Sudanese branch of Interpol. Apparently the name ‘John Edward’ wasone of the half dozen or so aliases used by an internationally wanted drugsdealer. Ed’s fate had been sealed when the investigating officers had noticedthat his passport contained a visa stamp for Colombia, the cocaine capital ofthe world. The fact that he had been there to film a news story for Channel 4had not impressed the Sudanese detectives at all, nor had his distinctnon-resemblance to the photograph of the wanted man that had been wired byInterpol. Fortunately a set of fingerprints had been sent as well and, ratherlate in the evening, someone had the bright idea of comparing Ed’s fingerprintswith these. His release had followed shortly afterwards.The next day we told the story to Haile Kiros, the TPLF representative, whoturned up at the Hilton in the middle of the afternoon. Though it had beenrather worrying at the time, it was risible in retrospect and the three of ushad a good laugh about it.We then began to discuss the logistics of the trip to Axum and, as we did so, Ifound myself watching Haile Kiros closely. I could detect absolutely nothing inhis demeanour, however, to suggest that he might wish me any harm whatsoever. Onthe contrary, he was an affable, easy-going, sophisticated individual who wasclearly devoted to the cause of overthrowing the Ethiopian government butotherwise appeared to be entirely without malice. As we talked it began to dawnon me just how badly I might have got things out of perspective in the precedingmonths. Confronted with the friendly reality of Haile Kiros, all the fears andanxieties that I had suffered at the prospect of putting myself into the handsof the rebels looked unwarranted and all the dark imaginings that I had admittedinto my life seemed absurd.On the morning of Saturday 12 January we were joined by a TPLF official whom Iwas only ever to know by the single name of ‘Hagos’. Lean and slightly built,with a complexion scarred by childhood smallpox, he explained that he had beenassigned to accompany us to Axum – where he had been born – and to return withus from there when our work was complete. Meanwhile, here in Khartoum, he wouldfacilitate our travel warrants to the border and would also help us to hire avehicle for the journey.By noon we had completed the paperwork and by the early evening we had done adeal with an Eritrean businessman resident in the Sudan who agreed to provide uswith a sturdy Toyota Landcruiser, an even sturdier driver named Tesfaye, and sixjerry-cans for spare fuel. At US$200 per day the rental seemed to me a bargain:I knew, you see, that much of our journey would have to be made by night onprecarious mountain tracks so as to avoid the unwelcome attentions of theEthiopian government aircraft that still patrolled the daytime skies above therebel province of Tigray.The next morning, Sunday 13 January, we left Khartoum just before dawn. Ahead ofus lay hundreds of kilometres of Sudanese desert into which we now motored athigh speed. Tesfaye, our driver, was a piratical-looking character with woollyhair, tobacco-yellow teeth, and a wandering eye; he handled the Landcruiser withmasterful confidence, however, and clearly knew the route well. Beside him inthe front of the vehicle, keeping his own counsel, sat Hagos. Ed and I occupiedthe rear bench and said little to each other as the sun of a white-hot daygradually rose to greet us.We were aiming for the frontier town of Kassala where, that evening, a convoy oflorries operated by the Relief Society of Tigray would be marshalling to crossthe border. Our plan was to join that convoy and ride with it as far as we couldin the direction of Axum. ‘It is safer to travel in a large group,’ Hagosexplained, ‘in case anything goes wrong.’The journey from Khartoum to Kassala helped me to realize just how drear andempty the landscapes of the Sudan really were. All around us, in all directions,an arid plain stretched away towards the horizon, making me aware, as I hadnever been before, of the soft relentless curve of the planet’s surface.Then, as the day soared towards noon, we began to pass the desiccated corpses ofsheep, goats, cattle and – finally and alarmingly – of camels as well. Thesewere the first casualties of a great famine in which people, too, would soonperish – but which the government of the Sudan had thus far refused even toacknowledge, let alone to seek to remedy. This, I thought, was surely an act offatal arrogance on its part – the callous folly of yet another Africandictatorship obsessed with maintaining its own prestige and power at the priceof immense human suffering.But I had supported just such dictatorships in the past, hadn’t I? And even nowI could hardly be said to have severed all my links with them. So who was I tojudge? Who was I to feel regret? And by what right did I seek now to empathizewith the dispossessed?KASSALAShortly before two that afternoon we crossed the silt-laden stream of the Atbarariver near its confluence with the Takazze and I realized, almost with a senseof shock, how rapidly and how remorselessly the great distance that had onceseparated me from Axum was now being narrowed. Only a month before, thatdistance had looked impossible to bridge – a chasm deep and wide raging withnameless dreads. It therefore seemed almost a miracle that I was here and that Ihad been allowed to set my eyes upon the very rivers that I felt sure the Hebrewmigrants had followed when they had brought the Ark of the Covenant intoEthiopia – the mighty rivers that scoured the land shadowing with wings, thatpoured down into the thirsty deserts of the Sudan, that merged with the Nile,and that flowed on past Elephantine and Luxor, past Abydos and Cairo, to spendthemselves at last in the Mediterranean Sea.Soon after three p.m. we arrived in Kassala, which was built around an oasis ofdate palms and dominated by a weird granite outcropping which reared up morethan 2,500 feet above the surrounding plain. That red and withered hill, Irealized, though it appeared to be isolated, was in fact the first harbinger ofthe great highlands of Ethiopia.I felt a thrill of excitement at the knowledge that the border was now so close– just a few kilometres away – and looked around with renewed interest at theturbulent frontier town through which we were driving. Everywhere, oblivious tothe enervating heat, crowds of people milled about, filling the dusty streetswith bright colours and loud sounds. Here a group of quick and subtleHighlanders, down from Abyssinia to barter the trade of the mountains for thetrade of the desert, stood arguing with a stall-keeper; there a fuzzy-hairednomad sat astride his grumbling camel and gazed at the world with arrogant eyes;here a Muslim holy man, dressed in rags, bestowed benedictions upon those whowould pay him and curses upon those who would not; there a child, squealing withglee, pursued a makeshift hoop with an outstretched stick …Hagos directed Tesfaye to drive us to a small, flat-roofed house on theoutskirts of town. ‘You have to stay here,’ he explained, ‘until it is time forus to cross the border. The Sudanese authorities are a little unpredictable atthe moment. So it’s better that you keep your heads down and remain indoors.That way there will be no chance of any problem.’‘Who lives here?’ I asked as we climbed down from the Landcruiser.‘This is a TPLF house,’ Hagos explained, showing us into a clean courtyardaround which a number of rooms were arranged. ‘Rest, get a little sleep if youcan. It’s going to be a long night.’ACROSS THE BORDERAt five that evening we were driven to a huge, open, dusty expanse of groundlittered with the bones of slaughtered quadrupeds. Swarms of blowflies buzzedaround and here and there, amongst the mouldering vertebrae and the fustyshoulder-blades, lay little piles of stinking human faeces. To my right,thoughtfully arranging itself between Kassala’s great granite butte and the townitself, the sun descended the sky in a surreal extravaganza of tangerine andmagenta. The whole collage, I thought, looked like some existentialist vision ofthe end of all flesh.‘Where exactly are we?’ I asked Hagos.‘Oh … this is where the convoy assembles before crossing the border,’ explainedthe TPLF official. ‘We will wait maybe half an hour, maybe an hour. Then we willgo.’Ed immediately climbed down out of the Landcruiser and went off with his tripodand video camera to find a vantage point from which to film the lorriesarriving. His story for Channel 4 would focus not only on religious issues, as Ihad told the TPLF, but also on the burgeoning famine in Tigray.While he was making his preparations I wandered pensively about, warding offflies and looking for somewhere to sit down and complete my notes for the day.The charnel house atmosphere, however, had thoroughly disconcerted me. Besides,with the sun now resting on the horizon, the gloaming was already too deep towrite in.A coolness also had filled the air, an unexpected chill after the heat of theafternoon, and a keen wind sang amongst the derelict buildings that ringed themarshalling ground. People walked to and fro – shadowy figures of men and womenwho seemed to have come here from nowhere with nowhere to go. Meanwhile smallgroups of ragged children had gathered to play amidst the rubbish and the bones,their high-pitched giggles mingled with the lowing of a passing herd of cattle.And then I heard the rumble of approaching vehicles accompanied by a crashing ofgears. Looking back in the direction from which these sounds were coming I saw aglimmer of headlights, then a dazzling beam. Finally, out of the murk, themammoth shapes of perhaps twenty Mercedes lorries materialized. As they rolledpast me I could see that each one was loaded up with hundreds of sacks of grain,loaded so heavily that the suspension sagged and the chassis groaned.The trucks pulled to a halt in parallel files in the centre of the open groundand there, in twos and threes, their number was augmented by others snaking outfrom town. Soon the evening air was filled with billowing clouds of dust and thesounds of revving engines. And then, as though on a signal – though none wasgiven – the whole convoy started to move.I ran back to the Landcruiser where Ed, helped by Hagos, was hurriedly stowinghis camera equipment. Then we all jumped into the vehicle and set off in pursuitof the lorries’ tail-lights. The trail that we were following, I could see, wasdeeply rutted and grooved and I wondered how many convoys over how many yearshad passed this way bearing food for people made hungry by the folly andwickedness of their own government.In our faster car we soon overtook the last of the trucks, and we passed perhapsa dozen more before Tesfaye – who was clearly enjoying the role of safari-rallydriver – slotted us into position in the middle of the convoy. All around us nowthe dust and sand that the vehicles were throwing up created a wild andturbulent agitation, sometimes reducing the visibility to just a few feet.Straining my eyes to peer out of the windows at the night as it rushed by, Iexperienced a sensation of tremendous momentum coupled with a feeling ofinevitability. I was on my way, going wherever I would go, to get whatever Fatewould send. And I thought: this is where I want to be; this is what I want todo.Shortly before seven we arrived at the border and halted at a Sudanese armycheck-point – just a collection of mud huts in the middle of a bleak andfurrowed plain. Carrying hurricane lanterns, a few uniformed men emerged out ofthe darkness and began to check documents and identities. Then, one by one, thelorries ahead of us were waved through.When our turn came Hagos was ordered out of the car by an officer who questionedhim closely, making frequent gestures towards the back seat – where Ed and Iwere doing our best not to look conspicuous. At one point our passports wereproduced and minutely examined under the headlights. Then suddenly the officerseemed to lose interest in us and walked off to harass the occupants of the nextlorry in the queue.Hagos climbed back into the Landcruiser and slammed the door.‘Any problems?’ I asked nervously.‘No. None at all,’ replied the TPLF official. He turned and gave me a broadsmile: ‘Don’t worry. They are not going to arrest Ed again. Everything is inorder. We can go.’He said something in Tigrigna to Tesfaye who happily released the handbrake andgunned the engine. Then we rolled forward across the border and on into Ethiopia– though not yet into Tigray. Our route, I knew, would take us first throughterritory controlled by the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, a guerillamovement older than the TPLF which had been fighting for the independence ofEritrea for almost thirty years and which now, in early 1991, was nearer thanever before to achieving its objective. As we drove I asked Hagos about thelinks between the two rebel groups.‘We co-operate closely,’ he explained. ‘But the EPLF is campaigning to create aseparate Eritrean state whereas we in the TPLF do not seek to secede but only tomake it possible for a democratic government to be elected in Ethiopia.’‘And to do that you have to overthrow Mengistu?’‘Certainly. He and his Workers’ Party are the main obstacles to freedom in ourcountry.’We drove on for about half an hour, during which we saw no sign of the rest ofthe convoy. Then suddenly lights appeared in front of us and we pulled to a haltamongst parked lorries in what seemed to be a broad valley surrounded by lowhills.‘Why are we stopping?’ I asked Hagos.‘We will wait for the other vehicles behind us to catch up. Also we will collectsome TPLF fighters who will travel with us as guards for the convoy.’Without further explanation Hagos then got out of the Landcruiser anddisappeared. Ed grabbed his camera and a hand-held light and walked off too.A moment later I decided that I might as well stretch my legs and have a lookaround. Stepping down into the velvety coolness of the night, I stood for awhile quite close to the vehicle gazing up at the sky. I was aware of the fainteffulgence shed by the clusters of stars and the crescent moon above me, and Icould just make out the silhouettes of the nearby trucks, their headlights nowextinguished. Off to my right, almost lost in deep shadow, was a grove of acaciathorn trees. Further away a white rock at the top of a hill reflected a delicateincandescence.Gradually my eyes adjusted and I was able to see more and more of what was goingon around me. Groups of fierce and brigandish-looking men stood here and thereor crouched down on the ground talking in low voices. And whereas there had beenno guns in evidence while we were still inside the Sudan, everyone now appearedto be armed with automatic weapons.Feeling slightly apprehensive, I walked amongst the parked lorries and, after afew moments, came across Hagos, who was conversing with several TPLF fightersdressed in battle fatigues. As I approached I was startled to hear the harshmetallic clunk of an AK47 assault rifle being cocked and I thought: I’m going toget shot and it’s going to be now.But instead Hagos welcomed me and introduced me to the other men. I had evenbeen wrong about the noise I had heard – which turned out to have been producedby a weapon being expertly stripped and cleaned. Not for the first time Iexperienced a sense of shame at the self-inflicted terrors that I had endured inthe months before setting out on this trip. And I resolved that henceforward Iwould trust the rebels – who, after all, had also been obliged to trust me.It was quite some time before we were back on the road: one of the lorries thathad passed through the border post behind us had punctured a tyre and it seemedto be a matter of policy to keep the convoy together. Eventually, however, weset off and drove for perhaps another two hours.Then – and I don’t think it was later than eleven p.m. – we stopped again. Weseemed, though I could not be sure, to be in the middle of a vast plain. Hereall the vehicles arranged themselves side by side into a straight rank anddoused their headlights.‘We won’t be going any further tonight,’ Hagos announced after a moment’ssilence.‘Why not?’ I asked.‘There is shelter nearby and we will have to spend tomorrow there. The next safeplace is too far ahead for us to reach before sunrise.’And with that, cradling an AK47 that he had somehow acquired, the TPLF officialfell asleep.BREAKFAST AT TESSENEII slept, too – though rather badly – with my feet and shins stuck out of theopen side-window of the Landcruiser. Then, after a few hours of troubled dreamsand restless discomfort, I was awakened by the asthmatic sounds of enginesturning over and the smell of diesel smoke.We did not drive far. Less than a kilometre away there was a copse of tall,thickly leaved trees under which the entire convoy proceeded to conceal itself.I watched with amazement as canvas tarpaulins were produced and draped over allthe vehicles, including our own. ‘To cut out reflections,’ Hagos explained.‘From the air we will be almost invisible unless any shining metal attracts theMiGs.’ He then added that even the most careful attempts at camouflage could notguarantee our safety: ‘Sometimes the pilots just bomb and strafe woodland likethis on the off-chance that relief trucks will be taking cover there.’The sun had risen while the convoy was being hidden and, in the pale light ofthe early morning, like a salutary lesson, I could see the blackened andburnt-out hulks of three Mercedes lorries. ‘They hit those a few weeks ago,’said Hagos. ‘It was just bad luck.’ He then broke a leaf-covered branch from oneof the trees and walked out onto the sandy plain behind us. There he joinedTesfaye and several of the other drivers who were methodically engaged inbrushing over the criss-crossed network of tyre tracks leading to the copse.At around eight in the morning all was done and Hagos proposed that we walk intothe nearby Eritrean town of Tessenei.‘How far is that?’ I asked.‘Not far. Half an hour or so. We should be quite safe. The MiGs are mainlyinterested in high-value targets like trucks. They don’t usually shoot up smallgroups of people out in the open.’‘And what about the towns?’‘Sometimes they attack the towns if they see any vehicles or any large publicgathering. Tessenei has been bombed many times.’The walk was a pleasant one, along an earth path through little clumps of scrubvegetation amidst which brightly coloured birds darted prettily to and fro.Looking around I could see that we were in rising country and, in the fardistance, I thought that I could just make out the hazy silhouettes of loftymountains.Tessenei itself was surrounded by eroded granite hills in a boulder-strewnvalley. Not a single car moved on the largely unpaved streets but there werepeople everywhere: children playing, an old woman leading a heavily ladendonkey, three attractive teenage girls who covered their faces and fled gigglingas we approached, and large numbers of armed men – all of whom greeted us withwarm smiles and cheerful waves.The town, frankly, was a mess. Most of the poor, flat-roofed buildings showedsigns of house-to-house fighting – gaping holes blown through walls, façadescratered by machine-gun bullets, collapsed masonry. Above us, to our right, wasthe hospital, completely gutted. Underfoot, everywhere we walked, were countlessspent shell cases that formed a glittering, clinking carpet.I asked Hagos: ‘What happened here?’‘A few years ago, when the government seemed to be winning the war, Tessenei wasone of the last strongholds of the EPLF. In fact the Ethiopian army seized thetown several times, but the EPLF always got it back again. There was a greatdeal of heavy fighting – very brutal, very bloody. But now the front line is faraway and it is peaceful here – except for the bombing.’A few minutes later Hagos led us into a small hotel which consisted of perhapstwenty rooms arranged in a square around an earthen courtyard. Here, under acanopy of camouflage netting, several groups of Eritreans were sitting at tablesdrinking cups of coffee and conversing light-heartedly. A waitress bustled toand fro and a promising aroma of cooking filled the air.There was, I decided, a rather décontracté, boulevard atmosphere about thislittle scene which contrasted remarkably with the devastation outside. People,clearly, could adapt to almost any circumstances – no matter how grim – and finda way to make life bearable.As though reading my thoughts, Hagos said to me as we sat down: ‘They don’t havemuch, but at least they are free now. And conditions are getting better everyday.’Evidence that this was indeed so soon arrived in the form of a breakfast offried eggs and a six-pack of Dutch beer.‘Where on earth did they get this from?’ I spluttered as I opened my first can.‘Since the EPLF took back the port of Massawa from the government last yearthere has been beer in Eritrea,’ explained Hagos with a smile. He opened a canfor himself and took a long swig, then added: ‘It is a great luxury afterKhartoum, is it not?’In this fashion, drinking beer and chatting with half the population of Tessenei– who had by now trooped into the hotel to see the foreigners – we whiled awaymost of the morning. At noon we tuned in to Ed’s short-wave radio and listenedto the increasingly gloomy news from the Arabian Gulf. It was now Monday 14January and the UN deadline for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from occupiedKuwait was due to expire at midnight on the 15th.We then slept for a few hours, awoke at four p.m., and walked out to rejoin theconvoy in time for its scheduled departure at six.THE MAGIC AND THE MARVELSThat night’s journey seemed to go on for ever, although in reality it onlylasted for eleven hours. Full darkness had fallen by the time we left Tessenei.Tesfaye manoeuvred us into his favourite spot in the middle of the convoy andthen, amidst the now familiar clouds of dust, we began an epic drive through thewestern foothills of Ethiopia’s great central escarpment and then up into themountains beyond.Around one in the morning we stopped to refill the Landcruiser’s tank from thereeking jerry-cans that we had brought with us. Stiff and cramped, bruised fromthe pounding I had taken on the bumpy and rutted tracks, I stepped down from thevehicle while this operation was under way and watched the lorries that had beenbehind us roll by one by one, their headlights blazing, air brakes hissing.When the last of them had gone past and disappeared I took a deep breath, andgazed up at the constellations overhead and felt grateful to whatever goodfortune it was that had allowed me to be here. Then we were back on the road,back amongst the potholes and the gullies, lurching forward to catch up with theconvoy.Soon I became aware, as I had not been before, that we were ascendingincreasingly precipitous gradients, winding around hairpin bends that seemed tohang suspended over empty space, powering forward across bleak stretches ofplateau, and then climbing again. And I had the sense of great distances beingcovered and of profound changes in the terrain.I knew that at some point in the past few hours we had crossed over the borderfrom Eritrea into Tigray. And gradually, though my body ached from theunremitting pummelling that it was taking, I found myself slipping into adream-like state in which everything that had happened to me during the past twoyears, the strange twists and turns of my quest, the dead-ends, and the momentsof discovery, seemed to merge into a single continuous and coherent form. And Iunderstood, all at once and with boundless clarity, that the search which hadobsessed me for so long would amount to just a poor and meaningless adventure ifit had been motivated only by avarice and ambition. Lying in the remote darknessof its sanctuary, the Ark of God might glitter with ancient gold, but its realvalue did not lie in that. Neither did it matter that it was an archaeologicaltreasure beyond price. Indeed nothing about it that could be measured, orcalculated, or evaluated, or costed out had the slightest significance, and if Ihad ever set my eyes on these things (and I knew in my heart that I had) thenthe error that I had committed verged on desecration – not of the object sought,but of the seeker, not of the the Holy Ark, but of myself.And where, if not in the material world, did the true value of the relic lie?Why … in its mystery, of course, and in its enchantment, and in the hold that ithad exercised upon human imaginations in many different lands across all thelong and weary centuries. These were the enduring things – the magic and themarvels, the inspiration and the hope. Better to hold fast to them than toephemeral prizes; better to aspire with a certain nobility and to win nothingthan to succeed and later be ashamed.LONELY ROADJust before dawn, exhausted, grey from head to toe with the fine, powdery grimeof the road, we pulled into a small town where not a single light flickered, nota single person stirred.Here Hagos beat unmercifully on a locked door until it was opened. Then weunloaded Ed’s camera equipment and other luggage that we might need during theday and went inside while Tesfaye drove off to hide the Landcruiser somewhere.We found ourselves in a half-covered, half-open courtyard where people laysleeping on rudimentary beds. Some of these beds, fortunately, were empty andEd, Hagos and I quickly acquired three of them. I then wrapped myself in asheet, closed my eyes and fell instantly asleep.A few hours later, when I awoke in full daylight, my two companions haddisappeared and a dozen Tigrayans were sitting around staring at me with keeninterest. I said good morning to them, got up with as much dignity as I couldmuster, washed my face in a dribble of water from a tap attached to a metalbarrel, and then sat down to write my notes.Soon Ed and Hagos came back – they had been filming the distribution of some ofthe food brought by the convoy. I asked where we were.‘This is Cherero,’ Hagos replied. ‘It’s an important town in this part ofTigray. Also it is the destination of the convoy. All the trucks have unloadedhere.’‘How far is it to Axum?’‘One more night of driving. But it is somewhat unsafe for us to proceed alone.It may be advisable for us to wait here until another convoy assembles.’I looked at the date indicator on my watch. It was Tuesday 15 January – justthree days away from the start of Timkat.‘Do you think we’ll have to wait long?’ I asked.‘Two, three days maybe. Or maybe we will be lucky and have the chance to leavetonight.’‘Why do you say that it’s unsafe for us to proceed on our own?’‘Because the government sends saboteurs into Tigray from their garrison atAsmara. They send out small teams to ambush vehicles moving on the roads. ALandcruiser like ours with just a few people in it would make a good target forsuch an attack.’‘What about the convoys? Aren’t they subject to attack too?’‘No. Almost never. Too many lorries. Too many guards.’The day passed long and slow, hot, boring and sticky. Then, as evening camedown, Hagos, who had been out and about for several hours, announced that noconvoy would be leaving that night. ‘I advise’, he said, ‘that we stay – atleast until tomorrow.’Seeing the look of horror that this remark had induced on our faces he thenadded: ‘But of course, it is up to you.’Ed and I had already made up our minds on this point, which we had discussedbetween ourselves at some length during the afternoon. We therefore told theTPLF official that we would like to press on – unless he thought it completelyfoolhardy for us to do so.‘No. It is OK. I understand that you want to get to Axum before Timkat. Thedanger is not very great. But I will see if we can bring one other TPLF fighterwith us in case there is any trouble.’At dusk we set off again. On the front bench beside Hagos was the guard he hadpromised – a teenage boy with startlingly white teeth, an extravagant Afro, anAK47, and three or four magazines of spare ammunition. He was a cheerful sort offellow who laughed a great deal and insisted on playing Tigrayan war songs atmaximum volume on the Landcruiser’s stereo as we drove through the night. But Icouldn’t help feeling that all his energy and bravado would not be sufficient tokeep the bullets at bay if anyone decided to shoot us up – from the cover, say,of that bush over there, or of that clump of trees, or from behind that bouldereven.I was amazed at how different it felt to be travelling alone like this,unescorted, with no great rumbling lorries in front of us and none behind.Before we had seemed part of some prodigious and invincible army relentlesslybeating down the barriers of darkness, driving away the shadows with a barrageof light. Now we were small, vulnerable, forsaken. And as we wound our wayamongst the withered trees of the mountain slopes I was conscious of theimmensity of these wild lands and of their bleak and implacable hostility.We climbed for several hours, the engine labouring under the stress, the outsideair temperature dropping steadily. Then suddenly we emerged at the top of anarrow pass to find armed men blocking our path.I muttered some expletive but Hagos reassured me: ‘Nothing to worry about. Thereis a TPLF camp here, guarding the road. These are our people.’ Opening his door,he exchanged words and handshakes with the rebels who had now surrounded theLandcruiser. Then we were waved through an improvised barrier and emergedmoments later on to a windswept plateau where campfires flickered amongst woodenhuts.We paused for half an hour to drink tea and then we were on the move again,edging forward through the lonely night. Behind us, one by one, the lights ofthe camp disappeared and were replaced by shadows.Time passed. I dozed, then awoke again to find that we were skirting the lip ofan immense valley: to our left the mountainside, stony and close, to our right aplunging abyss defined by the road’s ragged edge. And then, out of the inkyblackness that filled the chasm’s floor, a brilliant firefly soared up towardsus, a speck of pure energy pulling behind it a ghostly, luminescent trail. In afraction of a second this glowing apparition had reached us. It streakeddirectly across our path, narrowly missing the front windscreen of the car, andthen extinguished itself against the embankment.As this happened Tesfaye jammed on the brakes and switched off all theLandcruiser’s lights. Meanwhile Hagos and the guard whom we had brought with usfrom Cherero leaped out and rushed to the rim of the precipice clutching theirAK47S.The two men, I thought, looked lithe and dangerous, businesslike and unafraid.They seemed to move in harmony together, as though they were completing somemanoeuvre for which they had been well trained.‘What on earth’s going on?’ asked Ed, who had been awakened from a deep sleep bythe dramatic, skidding stop of the vehicle.‘I’m not sure,’ I replied, ‘but I rather think we’ve just been shot at.’I was about to suggest that it might be in our interests to get out of the carwhen Hagos and his companion came running back towards us. They clambered up onto the front bench, slammed the door behind them and ordered Tesfaye to proceed.‘I assume that was a tracer bullet we saw,’ I remarked a few moments later.‘Yes,’ replied Hagos matter-of-factly. ‘Someone down in the valley fired off afew rounds at us.’‘But there was only one.’‘No, no. We only saw one. Several shots would have been fired – a short burst.The normal practice is to load a round or two of tracer at the top of eachmagazine to enable the gunner to correct his aim. The rest of the bullets are ofthe ordinary type.’‘Charming,’ remarked Ed.We drove on in silence for a while, then I asked Hagos: ‘Who do you think shotat us?’‘It would have been government agents. As I told you, they are constantlysending such people into Tigray to cause trouble. At night they cannot bomb usfrom the air so they make use of these sabotage squads in order to disrupt thetraffic moving on the roads. Sometimes they succeed …’Another question had occurred to me: ‘Why didn’t they carry on firing? We weresitting ducks up there.’‘Too dangerous for them. Since they missed us with the first burst and sincethey were not very close to us, they would have been unwise to continue with theattack. There are a lot of TPLF fighters in this area. A prolonged exchange offire would have attracted attention.’‘Oh … I see.’I rested my head wearily against the side window of the Landcruiser and thoughthow easily life could be stolen by a mindless bullet and how fragile we all werebeneath our bluster and conceit.At around three that morning, picking up speed on a metalled road, we drove by afield in which a tank lay derelict, its turret blown askew, its gun-barreldrooping impotently. Then, to our left, I saw the hulking ruins of an ancientbuilding bathed in starlight. I was overtaken by an acute, almost poignant,sense of dejà vu and I asked: ‘Where are we?’‘We are coming into Axum,’ answered Hagos. ‘We have just passed the Queen ofSheba’s palace.’A few minutes later we entered the small town, turned right and left through thenarrow streets, and then pulled to a halt in front of a walled enclosure drapedwith creeping vines and tropical flowers. While the others knocked on the gateto gain admission, I slipped unnoticed around the side of the Landcruiser,dropped to my knees and kissed the ground. It was, I knew, an extravagant andsentimental gesture. But somehow it felt right.STRATEGYIn the morning I was awakened by bright sunlight streaming through theuncurtained window of the room that had been assigned to me. In the small hours,when we had arrived, everything had been in darkness, for there was noelectricity in Axum. But now, as I stepped outside, I could see that we werelodging in a pleasant little guest house built around a patch of green lawn.I ambled over to a terrace where some chairs were arranged. There, in a corner,a kettle was boiling promisingly on a stove fashioned out of a large oil can.Nearby was a kitchen in which two women, whom I judged to be mother anddaughter, were chopping vegetables.I was greeted with smiles and was almost immediately provided with a cup ofsweet, scented tea. Then I sat down and collected my thoughts while I waited forthe others to wake up.The date was now Wednesday 16 January 1991. During the night that had justpassed, the UN deadline for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait hadexpired – and I wondered, in a rather abstract way, whether World War III hadbroken out. Meanwhile, in just two days’ time, the Timkat ceremonies were due tobegin here in Axum and I needed to have a strategy worked out before then.I found myself curiously reluctant to march straight round to the Saint Mary ofZion church and to the sanctuary chapel. Strangely, having come all this way,those few final steps seemed the hardest of all to take. This was partly naturaldiffidence, partly superstitious dread, and partly because I felt that an earlyvisit to the church of Saint Mary of Zion would alert the priests to my presenceand would probably ensure that the true Ark would not on this occasion becarried out in the Timkat processions. It therefore seemed logical that I shouldhold back and keep a low profile until the beginning of the ceremony. Then, inthe scrum of wild dancing that I knew would occur, I might find some opportunityto get close to the relic and to take a proper look at it.There was, however, an argument against this strategy. Ever since my discussionin Jerusalem with the Falasha elder Raphael Hadane I had become aware that thereal Ark might never be used in the Timkat processions – that a replica might besubstituted for it while the genuine article remained safely inside the chapel.If this was so then clearly the sooner I introduced myself to the Axum prieststhe better. I would have nothing to gain by waiting and nothing to lose by beingopen and above board. Quite the contrary, in fact, because only by talking tothe clergymen at great length would I have any chance of persuading them that Idid not represent a threat, that I was sincere, and that I was a worthycandidate for admission into the presence of the Ark.For these reasons, faced with irrevocable decisions that had to be made rightaway, I was in something of a quandary as I sat drinking my tea on that morningof 16 January.In a little while a bleary-eyed Ed appeared from his room, clutching ashort-wave radio to his ear.‘Has the war started?’ I shouted.‘Well no, actually. It hasn’t. The deadline’s passed but there are no reports ofany fighting at all. Now what about some tea? Or coffee? Coffee will do. Andsome breakfast. Is there any of that around?’While Ed was being catered for, Hagos also arrived – though not from his room.He had obviously been into town already because, in tow behind him, was avenerable bearded old fellow in flowing vestments.‘This is my father,’ explained the TPLF official, making polite introductionsall round. ‘He is a priest at Saint Mary of Zion church. I told him about yourinterest in the Ark of the Covenant and he said that he would like to meet you.’AN HONOUR AND A BURDENI had, of course, talked to Hagos about my quest on several occasions during ourlong journey from Khartoum. I had learnt before we set out that he was a nativeof Axum but it had not occurred to me for a moment that he might have anyconnections with the church, let alone that his father would actually turn outto be a priest. Perhaps if I had known that I would have been more guarded in myremarks – but then again perhaps not. I had liked Hagos from the beginning andhad not wanted to keep anything from him.The end result was that any element of surprise that I might have retained hadbeen removed, not out of design or malice on anyone’s part but as the result ofa pure fluke. I decided, therefore, that there was no longer any point inattempting to be guarded or cloak-and-dagger about what I was here to do. Betterby far to put all my cards on the table and accept the consequences, whetherpositive or negative.I had a long discussion with Hagos’s father, who seemed intrigued by the notionthat a foreigner should have come all this way in the hope of seeing the Ark ofthe Covenant.‘And will I see it?’ I asked. ‘During the Timkat ceremonies? Do they use thereal Ark or do they use a replica?’Hagos translated my question. There was then a pregnant pause which the old maneventually broke with this reply: ‘On such matters I am not qualified to speak.You must talk to my superiors.’‘But you know the answer, don’t you?’‘I am not qualified to speak. It is not my responsibility.’‘Whose responsibility is it?’‘First and foremost you must meet the Nebura-ed, the most senior of all thepriests in Axum. Without his blessing you will be able to do nothing. If hegrants his permission then you must also talk with the guardian of the Ark …’‘I was here before,’ I interrupted, ‘in 1983, and I met the guardian then. Is hestill alive do you know? Or has someone else taken over from him?’‘Unfortunately that one died, four years ago. He was very old. He named hissuccessor to replace him and this new man is now at his post.’‘And he always stays at the chapel where the Ark is kept?’‘It is his burden that he may never leave the Ark. Do you know that hispredecessor, the guardian whom you met, attempted to run away when he was toldthat he had been appointed?’‘No,’ I replied, ‘I didn’t know that.’‘Yes. He fled outside Axum, into the mountains. Other monks were sent after himto catch him. When they brought him back he still wanted to escape. He had to bechained at the chapel for many months before he fully accepted hisresponsibility.’‘Chained, you say?’‘Yes. Chained inside the chapel.’‘I’m surprised.’‘Why?’‘Because it sounds like he really didn’t want the job. I would have thought itwas a great honour to be appointed as guardian of the Ark.’‘An honour? Yes, certainly. But it is also a heavy burden. After he takes up hispost the chosen monk has no life outside the Ark. He exists to serve it, to burnincense round about it, to be before it constantly.’‘And what would happen if it were ever taken out of the chapel – during Timkat,for example? Would the guardian go with it?’‘He must stay close to it at all times. But you should speak to others aboutthese matters. I am not qualified …’I put several other close questions about the Ark, but all of them produced thesame response from the old man – such matters were not his business, he couldn’tsay, I would have to talk to someone more senior. Interestingly, however, he didtell me that government officials had come to Axum shortly before the town wascaptured by the TPLF and had attempted to remove the relic.I asked: ‘How? I mean, what did they do? Did they try to go into the chapel?’‘Not at first. They wanted to persuade us that the Ark should go with them toAddis Ababa. They said that there was fighting coming and that it would be saferthere.’‘And what happened?’‘When they became forceful and aggressive we resisted them. They calledsoldiers, but we resisted them. The whole town heard what they were trying to doand there were demonstrations in the streets. Eventually they returned to AddisAbaba empty-handed. Soon afterwards, thanks be to God, Axum was liberated.’I was aware that the father of a guerilla fighter was likely to be biased infavour of the TPLF. Nevertheless I asked: ‘Since the government forces left,have things improved here for the clergy, or have they got worse?’‘Definitely things are better. In fact the situation in the churches is verygood. We go to the church to pray when we like – as much as we like, day, night,evening, whenever we wish. Before, under the government, due to the curfew thatthey had imposed, we were not allowed to go to the church at night, or to gohome from the church at night. If we went out from the church, even for freshair, they came and took us to prison. But we don’t have to fear now. We cansleep safe in our homes and go to church every day like normal people, and feelsafe. We don’t have to spend the night in the church for fear that we might becaught walking home at night. During the government’s time we never felt relaxedwhen we attended services. There was always fear, not knowing what might happento us or the church. Now we practise our faith in peace.’CROIX PATTÉEHagos’s father eventually left, promising that he would arrange a meeting for mewith the Nebura-ed, the chief priest of the Saint Mary of Zion church. He didnot advise that I should attempt to contact the guardian of the Ark before thismeeting had taken place: ‘That might cause some bad feeling. Things should bedone in the proper order.’Although this strategy seemed to me to be full of potential pitfalls, I realizedthat I had little choice but to go along with it. I therefore decided, whilewaiting for an appointment with the Nebura-ed, that I would explore some of thearchaeological sites which I had visited all too briefly in 1983 – and othersthat I had not been able to see at all.I remembered that there was supposed to be an ancient carving of a lioness on arock face near the quarries where Axum’s famous stelae had been cut inpre-Christian times. That carving had been out of bounds in 1983 because it hadbeen located beyond the area controlled by the military garrison. Now, however,it was accessible.While Ed went off with another TPLF official to film various sequences for hisChannel 4 news story, I persuaded Hagos to take me to the quarries in theLandcruiser. This was a risky thing to do because of the danger of an airstrike. However, we would be driving less than five kilometres and would be ableto conceal the vehicle when we arrived.We set off out of town past the so-called Queen of Sheba’s palace and soon cameto a rock-strewn hillside. We parked in a gully, covered the Landcruiser withits camouflage tarpaulin, and then began to hike up the scree.‘What do you think of my chances of persuading the priests to let me into thechapel to see the Ark?’ I asked as we walked.‘Oh … they will not allow you to do that,’ replied Hagos confidently. ‘Your onlyopportunity will be during Timkat.’‘But do you think they really do bring the Ark out at Timkat? Or do you thinkthey use a replica?’A shrug: ‘I don’t know. During my childhood I believed, and all my friendsbelieved, that it was the true Ark rather than a replica which was carried atTimkat. We never questioned that fact. It was not even an issue for us. But nowI am not so sure …’‘Why?’‘It does not seem logical.’Hagos would be drawn no further on this subject and for the next fifteen minutesor so we climbed strenuously in complete silence. Then he pointed out a giantboulder across a ridge: ‘Your lioness is there,’ he said.I had noticed that he had developed a slight limp. ‘What happened to your leg?’I asked. ‘Did you sprain it?’‘No. I was shot.’‘Oh. I see.’‘It happened a few years ago, in a battle with government forces. The bulletpassed through my shin, shattering the bone. Since then I have not been fitenough to participate in active service.’We had come now to the boulder and Hagos led me round its side. There, althoughpartially occluded by deep shadow, I could quite clearly make out the giganticsilhouette of a charging lioness carved in low relief. It was extensivelyeroded. Nevertheless it conveyed a lifelike sense of ferocity and sinuous grace.I knew that Theodore Bent, a British traveller and amateur archaeologist who hadvisited Axum in the nineteenth century, had also seen this carving – which hehad later described as ‘a very spirited work of art, measuring 10 ft. 8 in. fromthe nose to the tail. The running attitude is admirably given, and the sweep ofthe hind legs shows that the artist had thorough command of his subject.’ Benthad then added: ‘A few inches from the nose of the lioness is a circular diskwith rays, probably intended to represent the sun.’1[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-nts1]I now examined this ‘circular disk with rays’, which turned out to consist oftwo pairs of elliptical incisions cut into the bare rock. If these incisions hadbeen arranged around a watch-face then the top pair would have pointed,respectively, to 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock and the bottom pair to 4 o’clock and 8o’clock. I therefore found it easy to understand Bent’s interpretation of thedevice: at first glance it did indeed look like a series of spokes – or rays –emanating outwards from a disk-shaped centre.It was far from being that, however. Indeed the ‘circular disk’ that thetraveller had described was an illusion. If he had bothered to trace thecomplete shape defined by the spaces between the elliptical incisions he wouldhave found that the result was not a representation of the sun at all but of acroix pattée with arms that widened out from the centre point – in other words,a perfect Templar cross.‘Hagos,’ I said, ‘am I seeing things or is that a cross?’As I asked this question I ran my fingers around the outline that hadimmediately been so apparent to me.‘It is a cross,’ affirmed the TPLF official.‘But it shouldn’t be there. The lioness is definitely pre-Christian – so howcome there’s this Christian symbol beside it?’‘Who knows? Maybe someone added it later. There are other crosses, just likethis one, at the site of King Kaleb’s palace.’‘If you don’t mind,’ I said, ‘I think I would very much like to go and seethem.’THE WORK OF ANGELSI had visited Kaleb’s palace in 1983 and I knew that the ruins dated to thesixth century AD, the early part of the Christian era in Axum. I remembered thatit was a hill-top fortress with deep dungeons and chambers beneath.2[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-nts2] I did not, however, rememberseeing any crosses there.Now, as we drove back into town, I looked forward impatiently to exploring thepalace again. In 1983 the Templars had held no significance for me. My morerecent research, however, had raised the possibility that a contingent ofknights could have come from Jerusalem to Ethiopia in search of the Ark of theCovenant at the time of King Lalibela (AD 1185–1211) and could later have servedas bearers for the Ark itself.3 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-nts3]The reader will recall that I had found what looked like striking support forthis theory in an eyewitness account given by the thirteenth-century Armeniangeographer Abu Salih – an account that had spoken of the Ark being carried inAxum by men who were ‘white and red in complexion with red hair’.4[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-nts4]If those men had indeed been Templars, as I very strongly suspected, then it wasreasonable to suppose that they might have left some mementos of their orderbehind in Axum. It therefore seemed to me at least possible that the oddlyout-of-place croix pattée on the rock beside the carved lioness could have beenput there by a Templar artist.This particular type of cross, as I knew very well, was not one that was commonor popular in Ethiopia: indeed in all my years of travels in that country theonly place in which I had ever seen one had been on the ceiling of the rock-hewnchurch of Beta Maryam in the town of Lalibela – a town that had been the capitalof the very king who I believed had brought the Templars to Ethiopia in thefirst place.5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-nts5] Now I had foundanother croix pattée on the outskirts of Axum and, if Hagos was right, I wasabout to see several more in the ruins of King Kaleb’s palace – a structure thatcould well have been still standing and inhabited in the thirteenth century.After driving past the grass area where the majority of Axum’s great stelae werelocated, we skirted the huge and ancient reservoir known as the Mai Shum. Inlocal tradition, I remembered, this was supposed to have been the Queen ofSheba’s pleasure bath. Since the coming of Christianity, however, it had beenused for the curious baptismal rituals associated with Timkat. Here, in twodays’ time, the Ark was supposed to be brought in procession at the start of theceremonies that I had come to witness.Leaving the Mai Shum behind us, we motored about half way up the steep andbroken path leading to the site of King Kaleb’s palace and completed the journeyon foot after first camouflaging the car. Hagos then led me into the ruins wherehe poked around for a while amongst the rubble before finally exclaiming intriumph: ‘Here! Over here! I think this is what you want to see.’I hurried to join him and saw that he had retrieved a block of sand-colouredstone about two feet square and six inches thick. Out of it had been carved fourelliptical holes of precisely the same shape and disposition as the ellipticalincisions near the carving of the lioness. In this case, however, because theholes passed right through the block, there could be no ambiguity at all aboutthe shape of the remaining stone: it formed another perfect Templar cross.‘When I was a child,’ mused Hagos, ‘I and my friends used to play up here. Inthose days there were many blocks like this lying around. I expect that all theother ones must have been removed since then.’‘Where would they have been taken?’‘The townspeople constantly re-use the stones from the ruins to build or repairtheir own homes. So we’re lucky to have found this block intact … But there areother crosses, just the same shape as this one, in the cellars under thepalace.’We made our way down a flight of stairs into the dark dungeons that I hadvisited in 1983. Then, by flashlight, I had been shown a number of empty stonecoffers which the Axumites believed had once contained great riches in gold andpearls. Now, producing a box of matches, Hagos showed me a Templar cross carvedinto the end of one of these coffers.‘How did you know that was there?’ I asked in amazement.‘Everyone in Axum knows. As I said, I used to play in these ruins when I was aboy.’He then led me into the next chamber, struck a match, and showed me two moreTemplar crosses – one, rather crudely formed, on the far wall and another,beautifully executed, high up on the longer side wall.Until the flame guttered out I stood gazing up at these crosses lost in thought.I knew that I might never be able to prove my hypothesis to the completesatisfaction of archaeologists or historians, but I now felt certain in my ownheart that the Templars had indeed been here. The croix pattée had been theircharacteristic emblem, worn on their shields and on their tunics. It wasentirely in keeping with everything else that I had learnt about them that someof their number should have come down here, into the obscure darkness of thesedungeons, to leave that emblem on the walls – as a kind of puzzle perhaps, or asa sign, for future generations to wonder over.‘Are there any traditions’, I asked Hagos, ‘about who carved these crosseshere?’‘Some of the townspeople say that they were the work of angels,’ replied theTPLF official, ‘but of course that is nonsense.’A BEARER OF BAD NEWSI did not hear from Hagos’s father until after night had fallen, and when I didthe news was bad. He came round to the little guest house in which we werestaying shortly after seven that evening to tell me that the Nebura-ed was outof town.My first reaction, which I did not voice, was that it was extremely unlikelythat the chief priest of the Saint Mary of Zion church would be absent at thistime of year. With Timkat just around the corner, and many preparations to make,his presence would surely be required in Axum.‘How unfortunate,’ I said. ‘Where’s he gone?’‘He has gone to Asmara … for consultations.’‘But Asmara is still in government hands. How can he go there?’‘The Nebura-ed may go anywhere.’‘And will he be back before Timkat?’‘I am told that he will not return for several days. His deputy will stand infor him during the Timkat ceremonies.’‘So what does this mean for my work? Will I be able to talk to the guardian ofthe Ark, for example? There are so many questions that I have to ask.’‘Without the permission of the Nebura-ed you will be able to do nothing.’Hagos’s father was clearly an innocent messenger, so I had no right or reason tofeel furious with him. Nevertheless it seemed obvious that the information hehad just delivered was part of a strategy to prevent me from learning more aboutthe Ark. Though they would probably be polite and friendly towards me asindividuals, the plain fact was that the monks and priests of Axum would notco-operate with my investigation without the permission of the Nebura-ed. Sadly,however, the Nebura-ed was absent. Therefore I could not obtain his permission.Therefore I would not be able to find out anything of any significance fromanyone; nor would I be able to do any of the things that I had come so manymiles to do. In this classically Abyssinian fashion, I would be neutralizedwithout anyone actually having to refuse me anything. The clergymen would nothave to be boorish or rude; on the contrary they would only need to shrug andtell me with deep regret that this or that could not be done without thesanction of the Nebura-ed, and that – on this or that matter – they themselveswere not qualified to speak.‘Is there any way,’ I asked, ‘that we can get a message to the Nebura-ed – aboutmy work here?’‘While he is in Asmara?’ laughed Hagos’s father. ‘Impossible.’‘OK then. What about the deputy chief priest? Can’t he give me the permission Ineed?’‘I do not think so. To give you that permission he would first have to obtainthe permission of the Nebura-ed.’‘In other words he would have to get permission to give me permission?’‘Exactly.’‘But can’t I at least try? Can’t I even meet the deputy and explain to him whyI’m here? Who knows? He might be willing to help me.’‘Perhaps,’ said Hagos’s father. ‘At any rate I will talk to the deputy tonightand I will bring you his answer tomorrow.’SANCTUARY OF THE ARKThe next morning, Thursday 17 January 1991, we were all up and about beforedawn. Ed had wanted to shoot some general views at sunrise and Hagos hadsuggested that the summit of one of the several stony hills behind the townwould provide the best vantage point.Accordingly, at four-thirty a.m. we rousted Tesfaye, our driver, out of the bedthat he been sharing with a local prostitute virtually non-stop since ourarrival. On the road before five, we shoved the aerial of Ed’s short-wave radioout of the window. The reception was bad, fogged with static. Nevertheless wemanaged to unscramble enough of the broadcast to understand that war had finallybroken out in the Gulf, that American bombers had flown hundreds of sortiesagainst Baghdad during the night, and that massive devastation had been caused.Apparently the Iraqi airforce had not managed to send up a single fighter inresponse.‘Sounds like it’s all over,’ commented Ed with a certain amount of satisfaction.‘I doubt that,’ said Hagos. ‘We will have to wait and see.’We sat in silence for a while, listening to the continuing reports, as Tesfayemanoeuvred us up the steep track towards the summit we were heading for. The skywas still almost completely dark and he was perhaps dreaming of the humidpleasures he had so recently been enjoying; at any rate he managed to half rollthe vehicle at one point and only just avoided driving us over the edge of asmall cliff.Ed, Hagos and I took this as our cue to get out. Leaving Tesfaye to deal withthe camouflage tarpaulin we then walked the rest of the way to the summit.It was a short hike through the litter of an old battlefield. ‘This was wherethe last part of the Ethiopian army garrison held out when we took Axum fromthem,’ explained Hagos. ‘They were tough fighters, from the SeventeenthDivision. We over-ran them in eight hours.’All around us were smashed military lorries, burnt-out armoured personnelcarriers and gutted tanks. And, as the sun began to come up, I noticed that hugeamounts of munitions were still lying underfoot. Most of the debris consisted ofspent shells and chunks of shrapnel. There were also several 81mm mortar bombs,rusty but unexploded, which nobody had bothered to remove.Eventually we reached the summit, upon which perched the twisted and blackenedwreckage of a barrack block. There beneath the crimson sky of morning, I stoodand gazed gloomily down on the town of Axum.Behind me was the devastated ruin of a building. Its corrugated aluminium roof,still partially intact, creaked and groaned eerily in the cold dawn breeze. Onthe ground in front of me was a soldier’s helmet, split across the brow by someanonymous projectile. Further off, in a crater, lay a soldier’s rotting boot.The light was stronger now and far below I could see the garden in the centre ofAxum where the main collection of giant stelae stood. Beyond, across a desertedsquare, set back in a secluded compound, rose the battlements and towers of thegreat church of Saint Mary of Zion. And by the side of that imposing edifice,surrounded by barbed iron railings, sat a squat grey granite chapel, windowlessand barred, with a dome of green copper. This was the sanctuary of the Ark, nearand yet far away, approachable and yet unapproachable. Within it lay the answerto all my questions, proof or disproof of all my work. Accordingly I looked downat it with longing and respect, with hope and agitation, with impatience butalso with uncertainty.MEN OF STRAWWe returned to the guest house for breakfast. And there we sat until mid-morningsurrounded by a group of unusually sombre and pensive Tigrayans – all of whomhad come to hear the news that boomed and crackled out of Ed’s short-wave radioand that Hagos solemnly translated for them. Looking around at the faces, youngand old, handsome and plain, I was struck by the poignancy of this intenseinterest in a distant war. Perhaps it provided a distraction from the home-grownconflict that had killed and maimed so many in this little town. Perhaps itarose from feelings of sympathy at the thought of the savage bombing that otherswere now enduring.Taking in the nuances of this scene, I realized that such freedom of associationwould have been quite impossible for the browbeaten and terrorized townsfolk inthe days when the Ethiopian government still ruled in Axum. And it seemed to me,though there was great poverty, though the schools were closed, though peoplecould not move openly for fear of air strikes, though farmers could hardlyplough their fields, and though famine threatened, that things were better here– far better – than they had been before.Around eleven a.m., after Ed’s filming schedule for the day had been worked out,Hagos and I walked into town in the direction of the main stelae park. At onepoint we passed a handpainted TPLF mural which depicted President Mengistu as aravening demon with a blood-stained swastika on his cap and lines of armedsoldiers marching out of his mouth. Half a dozen MiGs circled above his head andhe was surrounded by tanks and artillery. The caption proclaimed in Tigrigna: Wewill never kneel before the dictator Mengistu.’We walked on through the pot-holed streets of Axum, past poor market stalls andempty shops, amongst the simple houses, encountering on our way a constantstream of pedestrians – monks and nuns, priests, urchins, dignified elders,peasants in from the countryside, townsfolk, a woman carrying a huge earthen potof water, groups of teenage boys trying to look stylish like teenagerseverywhere. And I thought: a few years ago I would have been quite happy tostand by while the government took all these people away to resettlement camps.‘Hagos,’ I said, ‘things are so different in Axum since you expelled thegovernment troops. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but the atmosphere’scompletely changed.’‘It is because no one is afraid any more,’ the TPLF official replied a momentlater.‘Not even of the bombing and the air raids?’‘We fear those things, of course. But they are more of a nuisance than a terror– and we have found ways to avoid them. In the past, when the government washere, we could not avoid the cruelty of the garrisons, the tortures, the randomarrests. That was the terror that oppressed us for so long. Yet when weconfronted it, do you know what happened?’‘No. Not exactly.’‘We discovered that it had been spread by men of straw and that freedom hadalways been within our grasp.’We had reached the garden of the stelae. As I walked amongst the greatmonoliths, I marvelled at the artistry and at the sheer skill of the forgottenculture that had conceived them. And I remembered that in 1983 the guardian monkhad told me that they had been raised up by the Ark – by ‘the Ark and thecelestial fire’.At the time I had not known what to make of the old man’s words: now, with all Ihad learned, I knew that he could have been telling the truth. In its historythe sacred relic had worked many great miracles: the erection of a few hundredtons of stone would surely not have been beyond its powers.MIRACLE MADE REALThat afternoon at four Hagos’s father came to the guest house to report that thedeputy chief priest would see us. He said that for reasons of protocol he couldnot accompany us there but gave us precise directions as to where we should go.Hagos and I then walked over to the Saint Mary of Zion church and entered into awarren of small dwellings built around the rear of the compound. Passing under alow arch we came to a gateway. We knocked and were admitted to a garden where,on a bench, sat an elderly man dressed in black robes.When he saw us approaching he murmured a quiet command. Hagos turned to me andsaid: ‘You must stay here. I will talk on your behalf.’An earnest conversation then ensued. Watching it from a distance Ifelt … impotent, paralysed, nullified, invalidated. I considered rushing forwardand passionately pleading my case. But I knew that my entreaties, howeverheartfelt, would fall on ears tuned only to the rhythms of tradition.Eventually Hagos came back. ‘I have told the deputy everything,’ he explained.‘He says that he will not talk to you. He says that on a matter as important asthe Ark only the Nebura-ed and the guardian monk are qualified to speak.’‘And I assume that the Nebura-ed is still away?’‘Still away. Yes. But I have good news. The deputy has accepted for you to talkto the guardian.’A few minutes later, having followed a maze of dusty paths, we came to the SaintMary of Zion church. Passing in front of it we arrived at the metal railingsthat surrounded the sanctuary chapel. I stood for a while, staring through theserailings. I calculated that with an energetic climb and a short dash I couldreach the locked door of the building in about ten seconds.Half joking, I mentioned this idea to Hagos, who responded with a look ofgenuine horror.‘Don’t think of it,’ he cautioned. He gestured back in the direction of SaintMary of Zion where half a dozen tall young deacons were loitering. ‘As aforeigner you command great respect. But if you were to commit such sacrilegeyou would certainly be killed.’‘Where do you suppose the guardian is?’ I now asked.‘He is inside. He will join us when he is ready.’We waited patiently until the sun was low in the sky. Then, as the darknessdeepened, the guardian appeared. He was a tall, heavily built man, perhapstwenty years younger than his predecessor. Like his predecessor, his eyes wereoccluded with cataracts. Like his predecessor he wore thick robes redolent ofincense.He showed no inclination to invite us in but approached and shook hands with usthrough the railings.I asked his name.In a gravelly voice he replied simply: ‘Gebra Mikail.’‘Please tell him’, I said to Hagos, ‘that my name is Graham Hancock and that Ihave spent the last two years studying the history and traditions of the Ark ofthe Covenant. Please tell him that I have come all the way from England, ajourney of more than seven thousand kilometres, in the hope that I will beallowed to see the Ark.’Hagos relayed this message. When he had finished the guardian said: ‘I know. Ihave been informed of this already.’‘Will you allow me to enter the chapel?’ I asked.Hagos translated the question. There was a long pause, and then the expectedanswer: ‘No, I cannot do that.’‘But,’ I protested lamely, ‘I have come to see the Ark.’‘Then I regret that you have wasted your journey. Because you will not see it.You should have known this if, as you say, you have studied our traditions.’‘I knew it, and yet I hoped.’‘Many hope. But other than myself no one may visit the Holy Ark. Not even theNebura-ed. Not even the Patriarch. It is forbidden.’‘This is a great disappointment for me.’‘There are worse things in life than disappointment.’I asked: ‘Can you at least tell me what the Ark looks like? I think that I couldgo away content if you would tell me that.’‘I believe that the Ark is well described in the Bible. You can read there.’‘But I want you to tell me in your own words what it looks like. I mean the Arkthat rests here in the sanctuary. Is it a box made of wood and gold? Does ithave two winged figures on its lid?’‘I will not speak about such matters …’‘And how is it carried?’ I continued. ‘Is it carried on poles? Or in some otherway? Is it heavy or light?’‘I have said that I will not speak about such matters, and therefore I will notspeak.’‘And does it perform miracles?’ I persisted. ‘In the Bible the Ark was describedas performing many miracles. So here in Axum does it also perform miracles?’‘It performs miracles. And it is in itself … miracle. It is miracle made real.And that is all that I will say.’With this the guardian thrust his hand through the bars again and clenched myown hand firmly for a moment as though in farewell.‘I have another question,’ I said insistently. ‘Just one more question …’A faint, affirmative nod.‘Tomorrow evening’, I continued, ‘is the beginning of Timkat. Will the true Arkbe brought out then, for the procession to the Mai Shum, or will a replica beused?’As Hagos translated my words into Tigrigna the guardian listened, his faceimpassive. Finally he replied: ‘I have already said enough. Timkat is a publicceremony. You may attend it and see for yourself. If you have studied as youhave claimed, even though it may only have been for two years, I think that youwill be able to know the answer to your question.’And with that he turned away and slipped into the shadows and was gone.THE SECRET BEHIND THE SIGNSThe object that was carried to the Mai Shum reservoir when the Timkat ceremoniesbegan late in the afternoon of Friday 18 January 1991 was a bulky rectangularchest over which was draped a thick blue cloth embroidered with an emblem of adove. And I remembered that in Wolfram’s Parzival the dove, too, had been theemblem of the Grail.6 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-nts6] Yet I knew,beyond any shadow of a doubt, that what I was looking at was neither Grail norArk. Rather it was in itself an emblem and a symbol, a token and a sign.As the Falasha priest Raphael Hadane had warned me months before, the sacredrelic kept in the sanctuary chapel remained there – jealously guarded in theHoly of Holies. What was brought out in public procession was therefore merely areplica of it – a replica, however, that was quite different in form from thefamiliar flat tabotat that I had seen paraded during the previous year’scelebrations at Gondar, and that did indeed accord with the shape and dimensionsof the biblical Ark.How, then, can I be so sure that it was a replica? The answer is simple. Not fora single moment during the whole of the two-day ceremony did Gebra Mikail, theguardian monk, leave the sanctuary chapel. Late in the afternoon of the 18th, asthe procession carrying the cloth-wrapped chest moved away in the direction ofthe Mai Shum, I saw him sitting there behind the iron bars, leaning against thegrey granite wall of the squat building, seemingly lost in contemplation. He didnot even look up as the priests departed, and it was plain that the object whichthey bore aloft held no special importance for him.Then, when they were gone, he disappeared inside the chapel. Moments later Iheard his slow arrhythmic chant. And had I been permitted to move closer I knewthat I would have recognized the sweet savour of frankincense.For what was Gebra Mikail doing, there in the thick darkness, if not offering upa fragrance pleasing to the Lord before the Holy Ark of His Covenant? And whyelse should he, who had been selected from amongst all his brethren to fulfil aprecious trust, have stayed closed within the sanctuary until morning, if thesacred and inviolable relic that he had forfeited his own freedom to guard hadnot remained there with him?In this way I believe at last that I did glimpse the secret behind the symbol,the glorious enigma proclaimed in so many wondrous signs – proclaimed and yetnot revealed. For the Ethiopians know that if you want to hide a tree you mustplace it in a forest. And what else are the replicas that they venerate intwenty thousand churches if not a veritable forest of signs?At the heart of that forest lies the Ark itself, the golden Ark that was builtat the foot of Mount Sinai, that was carried through the wilderness and acrossthe river Jordan, that brought victory to the Israelites in their struggle towin the Promised Land, that was taken up to Jerusalem by King David, and that –around 955 BC – was deposited by Solomon in the Holy of Holies of the FirstTemple.From there, some three hundred years later, it was removed by faithful priestswho sought to preserve it from pollution at the hands of the sinner Manasseh andwho bore it away to safety on the far-off Egyptian island of Elephantine. Therea new temple was built to house it, a temple in which it remained for twofurther centuries.When the temple was destroyed, however, its restless wanderings resumed againand it was carried southward into Ethiopia, into the land shadowing with wings,into the land criss-crossed by rivers. Having come from one island it was takento another – to green and verdant Tana Kirkos – where it was installed in asimple tabernacle and worshipped by simple folk. For the eight hundred yearsthat followed it stood at the centre of a large and idiosyncratic Judaic cult, acult whose members were the ancestors of all Ethiopian Jews today.Then the Christians came, preaching a new religion, and – after converting theking – they were able to seize the Ark for themselves. They took it to Axum andplaced it in the great church that they had built there, a church dedicated toSaint Mary the Mother of Christ.Many more years then went by and – as the weary centuries passed – the memory ofhow the Ark had really come to Ethiopia grew blurred. Legends began to circulateto account for the now mysterious and inexplicable fact that a small city in theremote highlands of Tigray appeared to have been selected – presumably by GodHimself – as the last resting place of the most precious and prestigious relicof Old Testament times. These legends were eventually codified and set down inwriting in the form of the Kebra Nagast – a document containing so many errors,anachronisms and inconsistencies that later generations of scholars were neverable to see their way through to the single ancient and recondite truthconcealed beneath the layers of myth and magic.That truth, however, was recognized by the Knights Templar, who understood itsearth-shaking power and who came to Ethiopia in pursuit of it. It was, moreover,expressed by Wolfram von Eschenbach in his story of Parzival, where the HolyGrail – ‘the consummation of heart’s desire’ – served as an occult cryptogramfor the Holy Ark of the Covenant.In Wolfram’s text the heathen Flegetanis was said to have penetrated the hiddenmysteries of the constellations and to have declared in a reverential voice thatthere was indeed ‘a thing called the Gral’. He declared also that this perfectthing, this spiritual thing, was guarded by a Christian progeny bred to a purelife. And he concluded his soothsaying with these words: ‘Those humans who aresummoned to the Gral are ever worthy.’7[Hanc_9780307829047_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c18-nts7]So too those humans who are summoned to the Ark – for Ark and Grail are one andthe same. I, for my part, however, was never worthy enough. I knew it even as Itraversed the waste land. I knew it as I approached the sanctuary chapel. I knowit still. And yet … And yet … ‘my heart is glad, and my very soul rejoices, andmy flesh also shall rest in hope.’Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.

V,1928, reprinted by KTAV Publishing House Inc., New York, 1968, p. 118: ‘the Arkitself came in popular thought and speech to be identified with the deity; theArk itself was to all extents and purposes the deity.’ The direct identificationof the Ark with God is well illustrated in the following passage from Numbers10:35: ‘And it came to pass, when the Ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up,Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee beforethee’ (King James Authorized Version). The Jerusalem Bible translation of thesame verse, which makes use of Yahweh, the name of God, reads: ‘And as the Arkset out, Moses would say, Arise, Yahweh, may your enemies be scattered and thosewho hate you run for their lives before you.’ The Interpreter’s Dictionary ofthe Bible comments: ‘The Ark is not only seen as the leader of Israel’s host,but is directly addressed as Yahweh. There is virtually an identification ofYahweh and the Ark … there is no doubt that the Ark was interpreted as theextension or embodiment of the presence of Yahweh’ (The Interpreter’s Dictionaryof the Bible: An Illustrated Encyclopaedia, Abingdon Press, Nashville, 1962, pp.222–3.2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts2a] See Exodus 37:1, which givesthe dimensions of the Ark as follows: ‘two cubits and a half was the length ofit, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the heightof it.’ The measurements in feet and inches are extrapolated from the ancientcubit, which was eighteen inches.

A.Wallis Budge used a variety of different words and phrases to refer to the Arkof the Covenant – e.g. ‘Zion’, ‘Heavenly Zion’, ‘Tabernacle of His Law’,‘Tabernacle of His Covenant’, ‘Tabernacle of the Law of God’. He makes clear atseveral points that these terms are all completely interchangeable and that theyrefer to exactly the same thing. For example, in his Introduction (p. xvii), hespeaks of ‘the Tabernacle of the Law of God, i.e. the Ark of the Covenant’.Likewise, within the main body of the translation, there are several points,cross-referenced to biblical passages, at which this interchangeability of termsfor the Ark (including ‘Zion’ and ‘Heavenly Zion’) is unequivocally spelled out– e.g. pp. 14–15 and 178. For purposes of clarity in my own text, and withapologies to Budge, I have adopted the policy of simplifying this confusingterminological spaghetti.

Stern was imprisoned, along with several other Europeans, and waseventually rescued by the Napier expedition to the citadel of Magdala which costthe British taxpayer several million pounds.41 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-nts41a] Date from The JerusalemBible, op. cit., Chronological Table, p. 343.42 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-nts42a] Leviticus 17:8–9.43 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-nts43a] See Geoffrey Wigoder (ed.)The Encyclopaedia of Judaism, op. cit., p. 615.44 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-nts44a] F.

Interestingly,the notion that Ethiopia might take steps to interrupt the flow of the Nile tothe disadvantage of Egypt is still in circulation. In January 1990, forinstance, aware of the close military and economic co-operation that was thenbeing developed between Ethiopia and Israel, the Egyptian government officiallywarned Ethiopia and Israel not to ‘tamper’ with the Blue Nile.

Thatmeeting may not necessarily have taken place in Avignon – which anyway was notpart of France at that time and which did not become the official seat of thePope until the year 1309. Between 1305 (the date of his coronation in Lyons) andMarch of 1309, when he officially took up residence in Avignon, Clement V had anitinerant existence, travelling around France and basing himself temporarily invarious cities. It is possible that he did meet with the envoys in Avignon: eventhough he had not yet established his official seat there in 1306 he could wellhave been temporarily in residence at the time. Alternatively the envoys mayhave travelled to meet him elsewhere in France. Foresti’s abstract from theoriginal chronicle was made nearly two hundred years after that chronicle waswritten. It may be surmised that the original did not even state where in Francethe meeting between the envoys and the Pope took place. If so Foresti may beexcused for jumping to the conclusion that the venue was Avignon since that wasthe Pope’s official seat for most of his period in office. Foresti may simplynot have known that he did not move there officially until 1309. At any rate,establishing the precise venue of the meeting is a matter of minor significance.The point is that a meeting did take place. For a discussion of these issues seeE. Ullendorff and C. F.

Here, for example, is Paez on his own visit to the twin springs whichlie to the south of Lake Tana and which are regarded as the source of the BlueNile: ‘On April 21 in the year 1618, being here together with the king and hisarmy, I ascended the place and observed everything with great attention; Idiscovered first two round fountains, each about four palms in diameter, andsaw, with the greatest delight, what neither Cyrus, the king of the Persians,nor Cambyses, nor Alexander the Great, nor the famous Julius Caesar, could everdiscover. The two openings of these fountains have no issue in the plain at thetop of the mountain, but flow from the foot of it. The second fountain lies abuta stone cast west from the first’ (quoted in Alan Moorehead, The Blue Nile, op.cit., p. 34). Jeronimo Lobo reached the source some twelve years after Paez, around theyear 1630. Here is his description: ‘The source of this famous river, the objectof so much searching but hidden for so long, is discovered … on a very gradualslope made by a certain mountain, seeming rather more like a rather irregularfield than a mountain slope with quite an expanse of open, flat ground, whereone can see for a fair distance. In this gradually rising plain, one discovers,in the driest part of summer, two circular pools or wells of water, which we canmore appropriately call pits four spans in width and separated from each otherby a distance of a stone’s throw … The whole plain, especially the part near thesaid wells … is swollen and undermined with water … and the reason it does notswallow up anyone who walks on it is that, since all the land is green and thispart has many various grasses and herbs, the roots are so intertwinedthat … they can support anyone who walks on the field’ (The Itinerario ofJeronimo Lobo, op. cit., p. 228). Bruce’s own ‘discovery’ was made on 4 November 1770 (a century and a halfafter Paez and Lobo) and was preceded by his guide pointing out to him a‘hillock of green sod … in [which] the two fountains of the Nile are to befound … Throwing off my shoes, I ran down the hill towards the little island ofgreen sods, which was about two hundred yards distant; the whole side of thehill was thick grown over with flowers, the large bulbous roots of whichappearing above the surface of the ground … occasioned two very severe fallsbefore I reached the brink of the marsh; I after this came to the island ofgreen turf … and I stood in rapture over the principal fountain which rises inthe middle of it. ‘It is easier to guess than to describe the situation of my mind at thatmoment – standing in that spot which had baffled the genius, industry, andinquiry of both ancients and moderns for the course of near three thousandyears. Kings had attempted this discovery at the head of armies, and eachexpedition was distinguished from the last only by the difference of the numberswhich had perished, and agreed alone in the disappointment which had uniformly,and without exception, followed them all … Though a mere private Briton Itriumphed here, in my own mind, over kings and their armies’ (James Bruce,Travels, op. cit., vol. III, pp. 596–7). As I read and re-read Bruce’s description I could not help but feel that itwas a kind of bastardized pastiche of the earlier experiences of Paez and Lobo(mixing the intertwined roots and swollen green marshes of the latter with theformer’s allusions to kings and conquerors). Moreover, as I have already stated,it cannot be denied that the Scottish traveller was thoroughly familiar with thewritings of both his predecessors.103 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts103a] Alan Moorehead, The BlueNile, op. cit., p. 49. Professor Edward Ullendorff, in his paper ‘James Bruce ofKinnaird’, op. cit., describes Bruce as ‘one of the great universal savants andmen of action of the eighteenth century’ and quotes the comment of the brothersd’abbadie, the French explorers, who said that they had consulted the Travels asa daily text-book and ‘had never discovered a mis-statement, and hardly even anerror of any considerable importance’.104 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts104a] James Bruce, Travels, op.cit., vol.

Both thesedocuments tell the story of the king going into the Holy of Holies and openingthe Ark. In his Travels Bruce gave a potted history of all the solar eclipsesand comets that had been seen in Ethiopia during the few centuries prior to hisown visit. In this potted history he drew extensively on Iyasu’s abbreviatedchronicle, which had mentioned a sighting of Richaud’s Comet in 1689. AsPankhurst put it: ‘The point is this. After describing the comet, theabbreviated chronicle goes on in the very next paragraph to report Iyasu’sencounter with the Ark in 1690. So Bruce must have known about it. That beingso, his suggestion that the relic had been destroyed by the Muslims in the early1500s does indeed look suspicious.’108 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts108a] James Bruce, Travels, op.cit., vol.

The Jerusalem Bibletranslation of the same, which makes use of ‘Yahweh’ (YHWH), the mystical nameof God, reads as follows: ‘Then from Yahweh’s presence a flame leaped out andconsumed them and they perished in the presence of Yahweh.’ It is important tostress that in this and many other similar contexts the Bible is actually andquite explicitly referring to the Ark when it speaks of ‘the Lord’ and/or‘before the Lord’, or of ‘Yahweh’ and/or ‘in the presence of Yahweh’. This isbest illustrated by the following passage from Numbers 10:35: ‘And it came topass, when the Ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thineenemies be scattered and let them that hate thee fall before thee’ (King JamesAuthorized Version). The Jerusalem Bible translation of the same verse reads:‘And as the Ark set out, Moses would say, Arise, Yahweh, may your enemies bescattered and those who hate you run for their lives before you.’ TheInterpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible comments: ‘The Ark is not only seen as theleader of Israel’s host, but is directly addressed as Yahweh. There is virtuallyan identification of Yahweh and the Ark … there is no doubt that the Ark wasinterpreted as the extension or embodiment of the presence of Yahweh.’ TheInterpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible: An Illustrated Encyclopaedia, AbingdonPress, Nashville, 1962, pp. 222–3.12 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts12a] Leviticus 16:1–2, amalgam ofKing James Authorized Version and Jerusalem Bible translations.13 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts13a] Louis Ginzberg, Legends ofthe Jews, Jewish Publication Society of America, Philadelphia, 1911, vol.

There has beena great deal of scholarly debate about whether the Israelites really did spendforty years in the desert (making Moses approximately 120 years old when thewanderings ended) or whether the period was shorter than this. Likewise the vastnumbers of the Israelites given in the Bible (600,000 men on foot, plus theirfamilies) have been hotly disputed on ecological grounds – since Sinai couldnever have sustained such a population. Both these points are irrelevant to myargument. For the record, however, I suspect that the Israelites spent a gooddeal less than forty years in the wilderness: four years sounds far more likely.And I suspect that their numbers were small – a few hundreds or thousands at themost.29 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts29a] Numbers 31:2–11.30 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts30a] Numbers 22:1.31 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts31a] Numbers 20:28.32 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts32a] Numbers 20:24–8.33 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts33a] Numbers 27:12–23.34 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts34a] Deuteronomy 34:4–6, 10–12.35 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts35a] Deuteronomy 31:14–15.36 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts36a] Joshua 3:3–4 (King JamesAuthorized Version translation).

It is therefore notdifficult to see how the word tebah came to be used in biblical Hebrew for theark of Noah and for Moses’s ark of bullrushes. That a different name (’Aron) wassubsequently used for the Ark of the Covenant could simply be a function of thefact that the Ark itself had disappeared from Jerusalem by the time that thebooks of the Old Testament came to be officially codified – and that thebiblical scribes, setting down the oral history of the Jewish people, had beenconfused or uncertain about some of the key details of the religious traditionfrom which the lost relic had hailed. If my theory is correct, of course, it wasnot “lost” at all, but instead had been taken to Ethiopia – where its originalname (Tapet or Tabot) has continued to be used right up to the present day.’ Ilater discovered that the Scottish explorer James Bruce had considered similarissues in vol. I of his Travels. He passed through Luxor (then known toEuropeans as Thebes) on his way to Ethiopia and speculated that the name‘Thebes’ must have been derived from ‘Theba, which was the Hebrew name for theArk when Noah was ordered to build it – Thou shalt “make thee an Ark (Theba) ofgopher-wood”. The figure of the temples in Thebes do not seem to be far removedfrom the idea given us of the Ark.’ Though he did not proceed, as I had done, tolink Tapet (the ancient Egyptian name for Thebes) to Tabot, I was intrigued thathe followed this particular linguistic trail.

In fact, as Lemesurier points out, thealignment is fractionally off true – by nearly five minutes of arc, orone-twelfth of a degree. But this would be to ignore the astronomical evidencethat the cause even of this minute error is to be found in the gradual movementof the earth’s own axis rather than in any inaccuracy on the part of thebuilding’s original surveyors.172 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts172a] Set Mystic Places, op.cit., p. 47; J.

Inthe late nineteenth century, for example, Sir William Flinders Petrie, certainlythe most eminent archaeologist of his generation, spent months at Giza carefullymeasuring the edifice – principally with a view to demolishing some of thewilder speculations of the pyramidologists. This he largely succeeded in doing(he claimed subsequently that he had provided ‘the ugly little fact which killedthe beautiful theory’). However, even he was forced to admit on severaloccasions that some of the achievements of the pyramid’s builders were quitebaffling. Commenting on the precision with which the 115,000 ten-ton casingblocks were laid around the core masonry, he wrote: ‘Merely to place such stonesin exact contact would be careful work, but to do so with cement in the jointseems almost impossible; it is to be compared to the finest opticians’ work on ascale of acres.’ Petrie’s remark is quoted in J. A. West’s Ancient Egypt, op.cit., p. 90.CHAPTER 13 TREASURES OF DARKNESS1 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-nts1a] Garth Fowden, The EgyptianHermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind, Cambridge UniversityPress, 1987, pp. 22–3.2 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-nts2a] See New Larousse Encyclopaediaof Mythology, Hamlyn, London, 1989, p. 28.3 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-nts3a] Ibid., p. 27. See also E. A.Wallis Budge, Egyptian Magic, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, London, 1901, p. xi:‘the world itself came into existence through the utterance of a word by Thoth.’Soon after I had learned this it occurred to me that the whole concept waseerily analogous to the well known biblical passage which stated: ‘In thebeginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. He waswith God in the beginning. Through him all things came to be, not one thing hadits being but through him’ (John 1:1–3). Intrigued by this coincidence I lookedfurther and discovered, to my considerable surprise, that the Judaeo-ChristianScriptures allowed a number of other close parallels to be drawn between Thoth,the pagan moon-god of the Egyptians, and Yahweh, the God of Moses. One of themost striking of these concerned the Ten Commandments given to Moses on MountSinai and supposedly inscribed on the tablets of stone that were containedwithin the Ark of the Covenant: ‘Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thoushalt not make unto thee any graven image … Thou shalt not take the name of theLord thy God in vain … Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy … Honour thyfather and thy mother … Thou shalt not kill … Thou shalt not commitadultery … Thou shalt not steal … Thou shalt not bear false witness … Thou shaltnot covet thy neighbour’s wife.’ (Exodus 20:3–17). I had always thought that this exacting legal code was unique to early Judaicculture. This assumption, however, was overturned when I found the followingremarkably similar formulae in Chapter CXXV of the ancient Egyptian Book of theDead – a chapter which consisted of a series of negative confessions that thesoul of the deceased was obliged to make before Thoth in his capacity as divinejudge and scribe: ‘Not have I despised god … Not have I killed … Not have Ifornicated … Not have I despoiled the things of the god … not have I defiled thewife of a man … Not have I cursed god … Not have I borne false witness’ (see E.A. Wallis Budge, The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Papyrus of Ani, BritishMuseum Publications, London, 1895, pp. 195–204). Perhaps the most strikingparallel of all, however, occurred in a rubric to one part of the Book of theDead which stated: ‘This chapter was found on an alabaster brick, under the feetof the Majesty of this venerable place, the God Thoth, and it was written by theGod himself.’ I already knew, of course, that the Ark of the Covenant hadfrequently been referred to in the Bible as the ‘footstool of God’ (e.g. 1Chronicles 28:2) and that it had contained the stone Tablets of the Law writtenby Yahweh’s own finger. I could therefore only conclude that the match betweenthe thinking and behaviour of Yahweh and Thoth – and also between the beliefsthat people had held about the two deities – was much too close to be entirelyfortuitous. Neither, I reasoned, was it possible that the biblical passages hadinfluenced the writers of the Book of the Dead since, of the two documents, thelatter was by far the most ancient (some of its contents, I knew, went back asfar as the fourth millennium BC; the most archaic sections of the Bible, bycontrast, were at least 2,000 years younger).4 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-nts4a] Garth Fowden, The EgyptianHermes, op. cit., p. 33.5 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-nts5a] Ibid., p. 23.

This earth shall enter into the wateryabyss by means of a raging flood, and will become even as it was in primevaltime’ (from the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead, quoted in E. A.

And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and itgrieved him at his heart … And God said, The end of all flesh is come before me;for the earth is filled with violence … And behold I, even I, do bring a floodof waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life fromunder heaven; and everything that is in the earth shall die’ (Genesis 6:5–17).32 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-nts32a] E.

It is worth adding with reference to this passage thatthe Israelites did not accept that it had been ‘the Lord’ who had blasted thehapless rebels. Instead they pinned the blame fairly and squarely on the man whocontrolled the Ark. Numbers 16:41 states: ‘All the congregation of the childrenof Israel murmured against Moses … saying You have brought death to the people’(amalgam of King James Authorized Version and Jerusalem Bible translations).

This was a dangerous trust, for out of the stavesattached to it would issue sparks that consumed Israel’s enemies, but now andthen this fire wrought havoc among the bearers of the Ark.’167 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-nts167a] See passage quoted in note164 above which specifies that the ‘veil of the screen’, a layer of leather anda layer of cloth were used to wrap the Ark. When the Tabernacle was pitched andat rest, the ‘veil of the screen’ hung in the entrance to the Holy of Holies. Itwas made of ‘blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunningwork’ (Exodus 26:31). Unusually for such an important accessory, it did notcontain any gold – and neither, of course, did the ‘covering of fine leather’ orthe ‘cloth of violet’. In other words before the Ark was moved it was firstthoroughly wrapped and insulated by several layers of non-conductive materials.168 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-nts168a] The view that the Ark wasdangerous to carry for some possibly electrical reason is supported by theJewish tradition quoted in note 166 above. The same tradition adds furthercredibility to this notion when it states that the Kohathites, rather thanbehaving as though they were honoured by being given the job of carrying the Ark– as one might have expected if it was indeed nothing more than a symbol oftheir God – in fact tried to avoid the duty, ‘each one planning cautiously toshift the carrying of the Ark upon another.’ Louis Ginzberg, Legends of theJews, op. cit., vol.

The oneness of this God is acceptedby all three faiths although Muslims believe that Christians are confused bysuch notions as the Trinity and the divinity of Christ.

Shishak’s campaign seems to have been mainly directed againstthe Northern Kingdom. Only one section of his army seems to have overrun theNegeb as far as Arad, without advancing towards the Judean hills. It is thus notimpossible that the temple treasuries and those of the king’s house with “allthe shields of gold which Solomon had made” were handed over to Shishak byRehoboam himself. He thereby succeeded in diverting the Egyptian army from hisland. This would be the meaning of his words “he took away” used with referenceto Shishak. The story in 1 Kgs 14:25–6 only mentions one particular part ofShishak’s route, highlighting it as viewed from Jerusalem.’54 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts54a] Professor Menahem Haran,Temples and Temple Service in Ancient Israel, op. cit., p. 284.55 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts55a] Ibid., pp. 284–5. Examples inthe Bible of Judaean kings who emptied the treasuries for their own purposesinclude Ahaz and Hezekiah.

The reign of Jehoash (Joash) is given as 798–783BC. 2 Kings 14:1 states that the conflict between Jehoash and Amaziah took placein the second year of the reign of Jehoash – hence the date 796 BC.57 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts57a] 2 Kings 14:12–14. The KingJames Authorized version states ‘in the treasures of the king’s house’. However,the more accurate and recent translations of the Jerusalem Bible and the NewEnglish Bible state, respectively, ‘the treasury of the royal palace’ and ‘thetreasuries of the royal palace’. It is clear that the translation ‘treasury’ or‘treasuries’ is the correct one here.58 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts58a] Professor Menahem Haran,Temples and Temple Service in Ancient Israel, op. cit., pp. 277 and 285,footnote 19.59 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts59a] According to theauthoritative chronology provided in the Jerusalem Bible, op. cit.

The King JamesAuthorized Version of the Bible wrongly translated the word hekal with thegeneral term ‘temple’, thus causing much confusion to subsequent generations ofscholars who did not have access to the original Hebrew. The hekal was aspecific part of the Temple – the outer sanctum which formed the ante-chamber tothe Holy of Holies.62 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts62a] For details see Chapter 11above.63 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts63a] See Professor EdwardUllendorff, ‘Hebraic-Jewish Elements in Abyssinian (Monophysite) Christianity’,in Journal of Semitic Studies, vol.

This outerpart corresponds to the haser of the Tabernacle or the ulam of Solomon’s Temple.The next chamber is the k’eddest where communion is administered to the people;and the innermost part is the mak’das where the tabot rests and to which onlypriests have access. In some parts of Abyssinia, especially the north, thek’eddest (the qodes of the Tabernacle of hekal of Solomon’s Temple) is called’enda ta’amer, “place of miracle”, and the mak’das is named k’eddusa k’eddusam(the qodes haqqodasim of the Tabernacle and the debir of the Temple). Thisdivision into three chambers applies to all Abyssinian churches, even thesmallest of them.’65 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts65a] This, as I subsequentlyestablished, had not been quite the act of senseless vandalism that the Englishversion of the text implied: the phrase ‘cut in pieces’ was a translation of theHebrew way-e-qasses, which did suggest cutting up but also connoted thestripping of metal plates from overlaid objects. Such a nuance made sensebecause the Bible stated unambiguously that the ‘golden furnishings’ that hadstood in the hekal had included the ‘altar’ and the ‘table of the showbread’ –both of which had been made of wood overlaid with gold. For a discussion seeProfessor Menahem Haran, Temples and Temple Service in Ancient Israel, op. cit.,p. 287, footnote 23.66 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts66a] 1 Kings 7:49–50 (JerusalemBible translation).67 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts67a] If this is not alreadypatently obvious to the reader, then it is made clear in the Jerusalem Bible’stranslation of 1 Kings 8:6 which reads as follows: ‘The priests brought up theArk of the Covenant of Yahweh to its place, in the debir of the Temple, that is,in the Holy of Holies, under the cherubs’ wings.’68 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts68a] As is demonstrated by theirtreatment of King Jehoiachin (2 Kings 24:11–12), their deportation of largenumbers of the inhabitants of Jerusalem (2 Kings 24:14–16), and theirdespolation of the Temple of Yahweh (2 Kings 24:13).69 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts69a] Research notes provided tothe author by David Keys, Archaeology Correspondent of The Independent, London.70 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts70a] 2 Kings 24:17.71 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts71a] 2 Kings 25:1.72 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts72a] 2 Kings 25:1–3. For the datesof these events I have relied on the Chronological Table in the Jerusalem Bible,op. cit., p. 346. There is a small margin of error in the dates allocated. Somearchaeologists put the ending of the siege and final destruction of the Templeat 586 BC – e.g. see Kathleen Kenyon, Jerusalem: Excavating 3,000 Years ofHistory. op. cit., p. 55.73 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts73a] 2 Kings 25:8.

Aparallel inventory, which does not contradict this one in any way, and whichalso makes no mention of the Ark, may be found in Jeremiah 52:17–23.75 [Hanc_9780307829047_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts75a] The view that the gold andsilver items taken by Nebuzaradan consisted only of relatively minor utensils isgiven additional weight by the text of the parallel list in Jeremiah 52:17–23which, in verse 19, states explicitly that commander of the guard ‘took thebowls, the censers, the sprinkling bowls, the ash containers, the lamp-stands,the goblets and the saucers: everything that was made of gold and everything ofsilver’ (Jerusalem Bible translation). See also Jeremiah 27:18–22 which refersto the objects not taken by Nebuchadnezzar in 598 BC and prophesies that theywill be taken after the second conquest of the city: ‘But if they be prophets,and if the word of the Lord be with them, let them now make intercession to theLord of Hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord, and inthe house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
