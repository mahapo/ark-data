[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 Commentary on the Pymander G.R.S. Mead from Thrice Greatest Hermes, Vol. II, by G.R.S. Mead . Of Vision and Apocalypse "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 The Pymander treatise not only belongs to the most important type of the literature attributed to Hermes Trismeg istus but is also the most important document within that type. It constitutes, so to speak, the Ground Gospel of the Hermetic Communities, in the form of a revelation or apocaly pse received by the founder of the tradition. That foun der, however, is not so much a historical personage as the person ification of a teaching-power or grade of spiritual illumination - - in other words, of one who had reached the Hermetic or rathe r \"Thrice- greatest\" state of consciousness or enlightenment. This stage of enlightenment is characterized by a h eightening of the spiritual intuition that made the mystic cap able of receiving the first touch of cosmic consciousness, and of retaining it in his physical memory when he returne d to the normal state. The setting forth of the divine teach ing is thus naturally in the form of apocalyptic scenes but of an ordered and logical nature. The treatise purports to be a s etting forth of the spiritual \"Epopteia\" (\"seeing beyond\") of the I nner Mysteries, the Vision revealed by the Great Initiat or or Master Hierophant, the One Mind of all-masterhood. This Vision, as we are told by many seers and proph ets of the time, was incapable of being set forth by \"tongue o f flesh\" in its own proper terms, since it transcended the consciou sness of normal humanity. Being in itself a living potent, i ntelligible reality, apart from all forms either material or in tellectual in any way known to man, it pervaded his very being and ma de his whole nature respond to a new key of truth, or rath er, vibrate in a higher octave so to say, where all things while r emaining the same, received a new interpretation and intensity. The interpretation of this Vision, however, was con ditioned by the \"matter\" of each seer; he it: was who had to cl othe the naked beauty of the Truth -- as the Gnostic Marcus would have phrased it -- with the fairest: garment he himself possessed: the highest thoughts, the best science, the fairest tra ditions, the most grandiose imagination known to him. Thus it is that we have so many modes of expression among the mystics, so many varieties of spiritual experience -- not becau se the experience itself was \"other;\" the experience was t he \"same\" for all -- but the describing of it was conditioned by the religious, philosophical, and scientific background of the see r."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 This element, then, is the basic fact in all such a pocalyptic vision. It is, however, seldom that we meet with a document that has come to us straight from the hand of a see r writing down his own immediate experience without admixture of the personal viewpoint. For the delight of this Vision is not that it gave new facts or ideas of the same nature as those already in circulation, but that it threw light on existing tr aditions, and showed them forth as being parts of a whole. Once a man had come into touch with the Great Synthesis, there rus hed into his mind innumerable passages of scripture, scraps of m yths, fragments of cosmogenesis, facts, and symbols of al l kinds that fitted naturally. These were not any special writer 's monopoly, there was no copyright in them, and they were all u tterances of the same Logos, the Great Instructor of humanity. The Corpus Hermeticum Thus the literature that was produced in the Corpus Hermeticum was anonymous or pseudographic. There was first of all a nucleus of personal vision and direct illu mination, then a grouping of similar matter from various sources int o a whole for didactic purposes. Nor was there any idea among the se mystics and scripture-writers that the form once is sued should become forever stereotyped as infallible; there wer e many recensions and additions and interpolations. It was left to those without the sense of illumination to stereotype the forms and claim for them the infallacy of verbal dictation by the Deity. Those who wrote the apocalypses from personal knowl edge of vision could not make such claim for their scriptur es, for they knew how they were written and the nature of their heari ng and sight at the time they were experienced. Traditionally, we have to treat all such documents as natural human compositions, analyzing them with microscopic attention as literary compositions put together from other so urces, overwritten, redacted, and interpolated. On the oth er hand, we have also to bear in mind that this was not done by clever manipulators and literary charlatans, but by men wh o regarded such work as a sacred and spiritual task, who endea vored to arrange all under the inspiration of a sweet influe nce for good, who believed themselves under guidance in their sel ection of matter, and in recombining the best in other script ures into a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 new whole that might prove still better for the pur pose of further enlightenment more suitable to their readers. The Great and the Little Man The treatise begins with a deep meditation. By open ing himself, the disciple reaches the consummation of his effort s, and receives initiation from the Master of the masters, who is to confer upon him authority to teach, that is, to be a master or like Hermes. That this Grand Master of the Inner My steries was both Man and Shepherd of men, the true Self of men, has been amply shown in the Prolegomena to the Corpus Hermeticum , but the striking parallelism with the very wording of our text, the Great Man, the \"Being more than vast\", who tells th e little man, that though for the first time he now knows his Gre ater Self, that Self has always been \"everywhere with you.\" Th is idea is best shown by the beautiful logos from the Gos pel of Eve (presumably an early Egyptian gospel): \"I stood on a lofty mountain and saw a gigantic Man and another, a dwarf; and I heard, as it were, a voice of thunder, and drew nigh for to hear; and He spake unto me and said: I am thou, and thou art I; and wheresoever thou mayes t be, I am there. In all am I scattered, and whencesoever thou willest, thou gatherest Me; and gathering Me, thou gatherest Thyself.\" The Presence The conditions of seeing the Holy Sight have been f ulfilled by the disciple; he has weaned himself from all lower desires. No longer, like the theurgist in the Hermes-invocation s of the popular cult, does he pray for wealth and fame and cheerful countenance, and the rest. His one desire, his only will, is now to \"learn the things that are, and comprehend their nature and know God.\" He craves for Gnosis -- Gnosis of the Co smos and its mysteries, Gnosis of Nature or the Great Mother , and, finally, Gnosis of God, the Father of the worlds. This is th e one question he \"holds in his mind.\" His whole being is concentrated into this question, this one point of interrogation. It is to be noticed that we are not told, as in the Gospel of Eve, that the seer stood, as it were, apart from himself , and saw his little self and greater Self simultaneously. He is conscious of a Presence, of a persona in the highest theological m eaning of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 the word, who is not seen so much as felt. He speak s to this Presence mind to Mind; he hears this Presence rather than sees it. The Vision of Creation The first part of the question he \"holds\" in his mi nd is: How came this cosmos into being? The answer is the chan ging of the Boundless Presence into \"Light -- sweet joyous Light.\" He loses all sight of \"all things\" in his mind (the me ntal image he had formed of cosmos) and is plunged into the infin itude of Limitless Light and infinite joy, which transports him out of himself in highest ecstasy. But he has craved for Gnosis, not joy and light, bu t Wisdom, the understanding and reconciliation of the great O pposites, the Cross of all Manifestation. Therefore must he know the Mystery of Ignorance as well as that of Knowledge. Within t he infinitude of Light appears the Shadow of the Unknown, which t ranslates itself to his consciousness as Darkness -- the Shad ow of the Thrice-unknown Darkness -- which, as Damascius tell s us, \"was the First Principle of the Egyptians, the inef fable Mystery, of which they said nothing,\" and of which our autho r says nothing. This Darkness comes forth from within outwards to t he disciple's consciousness, and it spreads \"downwards \" in sinuous folds like a Great Snake, symbolizing, pres umably, the unknown, and to him unknowable, mysteries of the differentiation of the root of matter of the cosmos that is to be. Its motion is spiral, sinuous, unending vibrations -- not yet confined into a sphere; not yet ordered -- but chao tic, in unceasing turmoil, a terrible contrast to the sweet peace of the Light. This primordial darkness gradually changes f rom Dark Space into a Fluid or Flowing Matter, or Watery Sub stance. That is, presumably, what the Greek mystics would h ave called Rhea, the Primal Mother or First Matter of the futu re universe before it has even been manifested. It wails and groans -- that is to say, its motion i s as yet unharmonized. In the terminology of the Sophia-myth us, it is the inchoate birth from the Sophia Above, in the Fu llness, brought forth by herself alone without her syzygy ( or consort). On account of its imperfection, she wails and groan s to the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Father of All and His Perfections, that her Perfect ion may be sent to fashion her child, who is herself in manife station, into a world of order, and eventually into Perfection in i ts turn. The Primal Undifferentiated or Chaotic Sound, from the Darkness of its first state, gradually manifests it self under the brooding power of the Boundless Light, into less co nfused thunderings and murmurings, and finally reaches a s tage symbolized by the \"Cry,\" which is a Voice of Fire. This is passionate Fire, not distilled Light, and it expres ses a need and want, longing for union with the Articulate Power o r Cosmic Word. The three most primal stages thus seem to be symbol ized by Fire, the Watery Substance, and Darkness. These wer e not our differentiated elements but the Primal Pre-cosmic E lements, what Christian theologists would call the Father, t he Son, and the Holy Ghost. The same idea, though in different forms, is met with in a system of the Gnosis preserved for us by the Old Latin translator of Irenmus and also by Theodorer w ho ascribes it to the Sithians, whom he says are also called Op hianae or Ophirae. Now, Seth was Typhon or Darkness, Dark Lig ht, and this Seth may very well have been symbolized as the Great Serpent of Darkness, as it is in our text. Hence th e name \"Those of the Serpent,\" perhaps given them by their theological adversaries (orthodox Jews and Christians). In this system the Primal Elements are given as Water, Darkness, Abyss , and Chaos. The Light was the Child of the supreme Trini ty -- the First Man, the Second Man, and the Holy Spirit or F irst Woman. This Light is what the Jewish and Christian overwor king of the original tradition called the Cosmic Christ. Thus the Fire of Desire, or the Cry in the Darkness , was to be satisfied or checked or quenched by the Light's fas hioning its inchoate substance into the cosmos; and so in anoth er Vision, preserved in another treatise in the Corpus Hermeticum , Hermes sees \"through the gaze of the Master,\" the c osmos in its finished beauty, when all things in it are full of Light and nowhere is there Fire or Darkness. First Emanation: The Descent of the Logos Upon this Cry for Light, into the Heart of the Dark -Moist-Fiery nature is injected a Holy Word, the Seed of the fut ure Cosmos."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 This Word is articulate, reasonable, and ordering. The Cosmic Animal Nature is impregnated with the Light of the Supernal Reason, which pervades its whole being. This pervad ing immediately effects an ordering of the Chaotic Elem ents into Pure Fire, Pure Air, and Pure Water-Earth. Moreover , it is to be gathered from the sequel that Nature saw the Word a nd all his beauty in her Fire and Air, but as yet only heard him in her Water-Earth. The Shepherd thus explains that Light is really Min d, and Mind is really God -- God prior to Nature but not prior to Darkness. The Unity of Light and Darkness is a still higher M ystery. Light and Mind is the highest concept the disciple can ye t form of God. The Light-Word, or emanation of Supernal Reaso n, is Son of God, Son of Great Mind. The Revelation of the Pleroma At this point in the treatise, the sequence of the narrative is broken by a second vision and is only resumed later . The breaking of the main narrative may be regarded as a necessary digression rather than as an interpolation of forei gn material. It is necessary in order to bring on to the scene the hitherto invisible Greatnesses, \"within\" the Veil of Light, which constitute the Economy of the Pleroma. More had to be seen by the disciple before he was in a position to understand what he had so far seen. He must now unite with the Light, his previous seeing being that of its reflection on his own mind . Not that this logos and Light (or Mind) are separate. They are in reality one, the Son is one with the Father in the state that tr anscends all opposites. The Logos apparently comes forth, yet it remains ever with the Father, and this coming-forth-and-yet -remaining constitutes its Life -- in other words, it is an em anation. Thus Hermes is bidden to understand the Light: as Life, and so make \"friends\" with it. Hitherto the Light had been one for him a sameness that his highest vision could not pierce, the Veil of Light that shut the beauties, perfections and greatnesses of the Intell igible from the eyes of his mind. To pierce this veil, a still more expanded power of sight had to be given him by the Master. T he little word or lightspark within him is intensified by the Great Word of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 the Master, this Word being an Intelligible Utteran ce of the One Mind, an intensification of being. Hermes now sees and understands the countless Power s within the Light, which constitute the Intelligible Archetypal Forms or Divine Ideas of all worlds. Between the sp ecial sensible cosmos of his prior vision and this Immens ity was a Mighty Power or Great Boundary (Horos) that encircl ed the elements of the sensible cosmos and held its Fire i n check. God Desiring Himself In amazement, Hermes asks whence come these apparen tly disorderly and untamed elements of the new world th at have to be subdued and separated from the concord of the pe rfection of the Powers? And the answer is that Chaos, too, h as its being from God's Will. Discord and Concord, Chaos and Cos mos, are both of God. The Primal Elements are, as it were, t he passions of God's Will desiring Himself. It is Himself as Mo ther or Spouse desiring Himself as Father. In other of the Trismegistic tractates this \"Feminine Aspect\" of Deity is called Wisdom, Nature, Generation, or Isis. He is Wisdom as desiri ng Himself -- that Desire being the Primal Cause as Mother of the whole world-process, which is consummated by His Fullness uniting with His Desire or Wisdom, and so perfecting it. Th is is the whole burden of the Gnostic Sophia-mythus, from whi ch the main elements of the Pymander might be derived. The Mother, when thought of as without the Pleroma, is impregnated by the Word, which the Gnostic Basilide s would have called the Allseed Potency of the Pleroma endo wed with all Powers, and sent forth as the seed of the sensi ble cosmos that is to be. The Mother in her higher nature cont emplates the Eternal Cosmos (or Order of the Pleroma) and in her lower nature copies its beauties by means of the permutat ions and combinations of her elements and the generations an d transformations of her lives or souls. What some authors have seen as the fundamental dual ism of our text is, however, by no means so very marked, f or it leaves it clearly to be inferred that the Darkness comes f rom the Light itself, for previously there was nothing but Light and all thing had become Light to the eye of the seer. It was, in my opinion, precisely for the sake of removing the thought of d ualism that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 the seer is shown a still more intimate vision with in the Light Veil, where all ideas of monotheism, dualism, trith eism, polytheism, and pantheism lose their formal distinc tions in a Formless State, or, at any rate, in a state of bein g where all are interblended with all. In describing it, the \"tongu e of flesh\" has to use the familiar language of form, but every wor d employed has a new significance; for even the \"tongue of ang els\" cannot describe it, or any of the \"tongues\" of heaven; He alone who speaks forth the Words of the One Mind can express it. Whence this sublime conception of the Pleroma came, I do not know. It seems to me impossible to find a geographi cal origin for such things, as, indeed, it seems vain to seek a geographical origin for the primordial dualism and the rest. For the writer of our tractate these ideas came from th e nature of things, from the immediate experience of sight. The form of expression, of course, may be susceptible of a geog raphical treatment, but as yet I am not satisfied that any c lear background has been made out for this supposed inte rpolation. The Feminine Divinity, next the Highest God, is not set over against that God, but is His own Will. He is in the Pleroma Vision as much and as little male and female as in the general narrative. He transcends all opposites and contains all opposites in Himself. What is clear, however, is that in the combination of both visions we have before us a simple and early form o f the Gnosis which we meet with later in Christian overwo rkings, and especially in the very elaborate expositions of the Basilidian and Valentinian schools, the systems of which can, in their main elements, be paralleled and compared point by point with our treatise; but this would be too lengthy a proce eding in our present study. Second Emanation: Mind the Maker We now return to the main narrative. Within the Wor ld-Egg, which was encircled by the Mighty Power (the Gnosti c Horos), there had already been developed the three Cosmic E lements of Fire, Air, and Water-Earth. This had been effect ed by the descent of the Cosmic Logos into the Primal Element s of Disorder. As the Logos descended, Fire and Air asce nded, and the Logos remained in Water-Earth. This was the res ult of the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 First Outpouring from the potency of the Pleroma th e First Word uttered by the One Mind. The Second Outpouring of Mind was of Mind no longer regarded as Light only, but as Light and Life, Male -Female. This emanation appeared as the enforming Mind -- th at is, Mind the Maker, the Fashioner or Former, Artificer or De miurge of lives or souls. It was the ensouling of the Ordered Elements of Nature with lives, whereby these Cosmic Elements we re drawn together into forms. The Great Mind, as Light and Life, reflected itself in the \"pure formation\" of Nature -- that is to say, in Fire and Spirit (Air), Fire for Light and Spirit for Life, to further enform, t hings. The Mighty Power or Self-limitation of Mind, the boundary that no mortal can pass, marks off the formative area of the whole cosmos. This area, however, was by no means only the mixed sensible world that we perceive with our present physical se nses. On the contrary, there are within it various orders of the main cosmos. For the Ordering Mind, as the Enformer or S oul- fashioner, differentiates itself into seven Ruling Forms or Spheres that \"enclose\" the mixed sensible cosmos; t hese spheres, therefore, must be of a psychic nature -- that is to say, of a pure or subtle substance. They are forms of su btle matter endowed with reason. They constitute the cosmic eng ine of the fashioning of souls, or psychic natures, and of the ir perpetual transforming. Their energies and activities are tho se of Fate, or the ordered sequence of cause and effect, symbolize d by spheres perpetually entering into themselves. In all the main phases of this divine operation, th ere is to be observed the idea of a downward tendency followed b y an upward. The Darkness descends; it then transmutes i tself and aspires above in a Cry, or Vibration, or primordial yearning for Light. The Word descends, and immediately the Fire and Air ascend. Mind the Maker descends, and immediately th e Word ascends from the mixed Water-Earth, which unites (a t-ones) itself with its co-essential emanation from the Fat her. This creates a space about the Seven, and thus leaves th e still down-tending elements in the Element Water-Earth de prived of its immediate presence, after giving physical matte r the initial impulse to order. This physical matter our author c alls \"pure"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 matter,\" meaning thereby matter deprived of the imm ediate presence of Reason. Hereupon from the impulse she has received, Nature begins her physical enformation, develops her physical ele ments and bodies of irrational lives. Water-Earth divides int o water and earth, and also air, for this air is clearly someth ing different from the Spirit-Air that ascended; the lower air is one of the downward elements. Third Emanation: The Descent of Man When this had been accomplished, there followed a T hird Outpouring -- the descent of Man, the consummation of the whole enformation of things, a still more transcend ent manifestation of Mind, the One Form that contains a ll forms, His Very Image coequal with Himself. God finally become s Himself to consummate and save the cosmos in the form of Ma n -- that is, to gather it to Himself and take it back into t he Pleroma. Nevertheless, the Word and the Mind the Maker and M an are not three different persons; they are all co-essent ial with each other and one with the Father. For the Word is co-e ssential with the Demiurgic Mind, and the latter is Brother of Ma n, and thus Man is coequal with God. And so Man, as the Beloved , descends; and in his descent he is clothed with all the powers of his Brother's creative energy, the creative ener gy of Life conjoined with rational Light. Having learned the lesson of the conformations and of the limitations of the Spheres, he desires to break rig ht through the Great Boundary itself; but to do this, he must desc end still further into matter. Before he can burst through up wards, he must break through downwards. Accordingly he breaks through the Spheres downwards, seeking his consort Nature b elow, and shows her his Divine Form radiant with all the energies bestowed on him by all the Powers above. And she in her great love, wound herself round the image of this Form mirrored upon her water, and the shadow o f it thrown upon her earth. Just as the Darkness wound itself, like a Great Serpent, round the lower parts of the Light, so doe s Nature coil herself round the shadow and reflection of Man. Man is Above,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 yet he is Below; man is free, yet is he bound -- th ough bound willingly in love for her who is himself. Some readers are greatly puzzled with all this. It must be noted, at this juncture, that the writer of our treatise d id not discover new ideas or invent new terms; he used what was in his mind and the mind of his circle. It was, however, the we aving of it into a whole, not as a literary exercise, but as a setting forth in the most understandable terms with which they were acquainted of the \"things seen,\" that was their mai n interest. Those who had the \"second sight'' would understand and appreciate their labors, those who had not would ne ver understand, no matter what terms or what language w as used. In this section of the Pymander, our treatise is en deavoring precisely to give an insight into the state of thin gs beyond Fate. The burden of its teaching is that all earthly dual ity and oppositions are really illusory; man can transcend these limitations and come into the freedom of the Sons o f God. Even the most terrible and fundamental oppositions are n ot really so, but all are Self-limitations of God's Will. And man is Son of God coequal with Him. The First Men Our treatise goes on to describe the first appearan ce of man on earth, which it regards as a great mystery never be fore revealed (\"the mystery kept hid until this day\"). T his I take to mean that it had hitherto never been written about but had been kept as a great secret. This secret was the doctrin e that the first men, of which there were seven types, were hermaphr odites, and not only so, but lived in the air; their frames were of fire and spirit, and not of the earth-water elements. The Ce lestial Man, or type of humanity, was gradually differentiating himself from his proper nature of Light and Life, and taking on bodies of fire and air, was changing into mind (Lightfire) and sou l (Life-spirit). This presumably lasted for long periods of time, th e lower animal forms gradually evolving to greater complexi ty as Nature strove to copy the \"Form\" of Man, and Man devolving gradually until there was a union of Mind and matter, and the human subtle form could find vehicles among the highest a nimal shapes. The first incarnate men appear to have been at first"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 also hermaphrodite; and it must have been a time wh en everything was in a far greater state of flux than things are now. To Increase and Multiply This period of pre-sexual or bisexual development h aving come to an end, the separation of the sexes took place. The commandment is given by the Word: \"Increase in incr easing and multiply in multitude.\" It is true that this is reminiscent of the oft-repeated formula in Genesis, but it is only sli ghtly reminiscent. The main injunction is similar, but th e rest of the Logos being quite different from anything found in Genesis. As nothing else in the whole treatise can be referred to direct Hebrew influence, we must conclude that the formula was, so to speak, \" in the air,\" and has so crept into our treatise. This increasing and multiplying, the perpetual coup ling of bodies and the birth of new ones, is effected by Fa te, or the Harmony of the Formative Spheres, the Engine of Bir th, set under Forethought or Providence. This Pronoia can b e none else than Nature herself as the Wisdom or Knowledge of God -- in other words, His Will. Love as the Will of God The motive power of all this is Love. If this Love manifests itself as Desire for things of matter, the Lover stays in Darkness wandering; if it becomes the Will to know Light, th e Lover becomes the Knower of himself, and so eventually at -one with Good. But why should love of body merit Death -- th at is to say, make man mortal? The disciple attempts an explanati on from what he has seen. Although his answer is approved, the meaning is by no means clear. The physical body, or body in the sense-world, is c omposed of the Moist Nature, which in a subsequent phase remai ns as Water-Earth, and in a still subsequent phase divide s itself into the elements of physical earth, water, and air. The dissolution of the previous combination of these elements is ef fected by Death -- that is, Darkness, the Drainer of the Wate r, the Typhonean Power. Water must thus here symbolize the Osirian Power of fructification and holding together. The M oist Nature seems to be differentiated from the Darkness by the energizing of Light in its most primitive brooding. But seeing that the Light"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 is also Life, the Darkness, which is posited as the ultimate opposite, must be Death. The Way of Deathlessness The Way of Deathlessness is then considered. The di sciple repeats his lesson, and the Master commends him; th e Way Up is the path of self-knowledge. Still the disciple c annot believe that this is for him; he cannot understand that the One Mind is in him, or rather is himself, in so much as Mind as Teacher seems to be outside him. The semantic play is on Mi nd and mind; the one gives the certitude of Immortality, t he other is still bound by the illusion of Death. The disciple has no t this certitude; the One Mind, then, is not his. The Master then further explains the mystery. Gnosi s must be preceded by moral purification; there must be a tur ning-away before the re-turn can be accomplished. The whole n ature must be changed. That is the alchemy of the cosmos. Ever y tortuous effort that the little man seems to make of his own striving is really the energizing of the Great Man. Those, however, who yield themselves to lower desir es, drive the One Mind away, find that their appetites are on ly the more strengthened by the mind in them. The original text of this paragraph is very corrupt, so that the exact sense of the original is not recoverable; and this makes it all the more difficult to understand what is meant by the Avengi ng Daimon, the Counterpart of the Mind. The Ascent of the Soul Before long, the subject of instruction becomes the Way Above, or ascent of the soul out of the body at death. The physical body is left to the work of change and dissolution. The life of integration and conservation ceases, and the life o f disintegration begins. The form thus vanishes, appa rently from the man's consciousness; that is to say, presumably , he is no longer clothed in the form of his physical body but is apparently in some other vehicle. The particular fixed form, o r \"way of life,\" or \"habit,\" he wore on earth being handed over to t he Daimon deprived of all its energy, so that apparently it b ecomes an empty shell."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 The senses that had previously been united by the m ind become separate. That is, instead of a whole they b ecome parts; they return to the natural animal state of s ensation, and the animal part of man, or his vehicle of sexual pa ssion and desire, begins in its turn to disintegrate, the min d or reason (logos) being gradually separated from it. Or rathe r, its true nature begins showing forth in the man, as he gradu ally strips off the irrational tendencies of the energies. Thos e irrational tendencies have their sources in Fate (the Harmony of the Spheres) It is in these seven subordinate spheres o r zones where he leaves his inharmonious propensities, depr ived of their energy. For Fate (the Harmony of the Spheres machine) is only evil apparently; it is really the Engine of Ju stice and Necessity to readjust the foolish choices of the so ul. That is, it exists to purify the soul's irrational desires, or those propensities in it that are not under the sway of t he right reason of the One Mind. The Eighth Sphere The soul of the initiated strips itself naked of th e \"garment of shame,\" the selfish energizings, and stands \"clothe d in its own power.\" This refers probably to the stripping off o f the dress of selfhood, the garments woven by its vices, and the putting on of the \"wedding garment\" of its virtues. This state of existence is called the Eighth, a state of comparative sameness that transcends the zones of \"difference.\" It is the Ogd oad of the Gnostics, the City of Jerusalem Above, the plane of the Higher Ego in its own form, the natural state of \"those-th at-are.\" In another sense, it may perhaps mean that man, aft er passing through the phases of the lower mind, now enters wi thin into the region of the pure One Mind, the Higher Ego, an d there is united (at-oned) with all the experiences of his pa st lives that are worthy of immortality, his virtuous energizings -- the \"those- that-are\" that perhaps constitute the \"crown of mig hty lives\" sung of by the Pythian Oracle when celebrating the death of Plotinus. In this state the man, who has freed himself from t he necessity of reincarnation, hears the Song of the Powers abov e the Ogdoad -- that is to say, in Gnostic terms, the Hym n of the Eons of the Pleroma, the Music of the Spheres. Such a man"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 would have reached the consummation of his earthly pilgrimage and be ready to pass on into the Christ- state, or, at any rate, the state of super-man. He would be the v ictor who had won the right of investiture with the Robe of G lory, and the dignity of the crowning with the Kingship of the He avens. This final initiation is most: beautifully set forth in the opening pages of the Pistis Sophia , and especially in the \"Song of the Powers,\" beginning with the words: \"Come unto us, for we are thy fellow- members. We are all one with thee.\" The consummation of the mystery is that the alter-e gos of the individual ego, or the sum total of purified person alities that in that state constitute its membership (or vehicles o f their own selves) surrender themselves to a fullness of union or a transcendency of separation, in which they become t he powers or energies of a New Man, the true Son of Man. They pass into a state where they each blend with all, and yet los e nothing of themselves, but rather find in this new union the c onsummation of all their powers. In this state of Sonship of th e Divine, they are no longer limited by bodies, nor even by partia l souls or individual minds; but, becoming Powers, they are no t only in God, but one with the Divine Will. In fact, in the final consummation, they are God Himself. Of such a nature was the Shepherd Hermes; he, too, was the Christ of God, the Son of the Father, who could tak e all forms to carry out the Divine Will. When the form -- even though that form might for the disciple take on the appearance of the cosmos itself, as he conceived it -- had served its purpose, the Shepherd once more \"mingled with the Powers.\" Thrice-Greatest Hermes The Shepherd Hermes was known as Thrice-Greatest, w hich described both his states of consciousness and the bodies in which he manifested. That trinity is carried forth in most modern religious and spiritual traditions. The Shepherd's name was Christ for those who prefer the name of the Christi an tradition, or Buddha for those who are more familiar with East ern terms. For instance, the so-called \"three bodies\" ( trikayam ) of the Buddha suggest he manifested on three levels not ju st earthly individuality. Buddhahood, like Christhood and Herm es, is a state beyond individuality in the separated sense i n which we"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 understand the term. In all three cases, the first step to existing in higher states is getting beyond the confines of one's individuality. In the Chinese Version of Ashvaghosh a's now lost Sanskrit treatise, Mabajana-Shraddbotpada-Shastra we read: \"It is characteristic of all the Buddhas that they consider all sentient beings as their own self, and do not cling to their individual forms. How is this? Because they know tr uthfully that all sentient beings as well as their own self come from one and the same Suchness and no distinction can be establi shed among them.\" The sentient beings who do not obtain Buddhahood or Christhood do not know that their Body of Transform ation is merely the shadow (or reflection) of their own evol ving consciousness. They imagine it comes from some exte rnal sources, and so they give it a corporeal limitation . But the Body of Transformation really has nothing to do with lim itation or measurement. That is to say, a Buddha can only comm unicate with such minds by means of a form, that form being really that of their own most highly evolved consciousness. The re are, however, others who have the consciousness of the \" formless\" state, but have not yet reached the Nirvanic Consci ousness. These in Buddhism are called Bodhisattvas. We have used the term \"formless state\" to signify t he states of consciousness in higher worlds but these are only \" formless\" for consciousness that has not reached the Bodhisat tva level. For this Body of Transformation has infinite forms and each form has infinite attributes. Each attribute has in finite excellencies. And the accompanying reward of Bodhis attvas -- that is, the region where they are predestined to b e born -- also has infinite merits and ornamentations. Manifesting itself everywhere, the Body of Bliss is infinite, boundles s, limitless, unintermittent, directly coming forth from the One Mind. An older Chinese version of the Sanskrit treatise quot ed above says of this Body: \"It is boundless, cannot be exha usted, is free from the signs of limitation. Manifesting itself wh erever it should manifest itself, it always exists by itself and is never destroyed.\" In other words, one who has reached the Nirvanic Consciousness -- that is to say, the Master -- can teach or be active on \"planes\" that are as yet unmanifested to us ordinary folk; these \"planes\", however, even when the discip le is"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 conscious of them, are conditioned by the self-limi tation of his own imperfection. The vehicles of this activity are called by various names in different spiritual traditions (Dh armakaya, Astral Body, the Wedding Garment) and the limitatio n of their activity is determined on the side of the disciple by the degree of his ability to function consciously in those sta tes that are known in theosophical nomenclature as those of Atma n, Buddhi, and the Higher Manas, or, in more general t erms, those of the divine, spiritual, and human aspects o f the self. In the first degree of conscious discipleship, then , the Master communicates with His disciples and teaches them by means of the human body. He quickens the highest form of consciousness or conception of masterhood they have so far attained to, taking the form of their greatest love , perhaps, as they have known Him in the flesh, or as He has been told of as existing in the flesh, but not His true form, which would transcend their consciousness. The next stage is wh en the disciple learns to transcend his own egoity in the ordinary sense of the word; this does not mean to say that h is true individuality is destroyed, but instead of being ti ed down to one ego-vehicle he has gained the power of manifesting himself wherever and however he will, at any moment of time . In brief, he has attained the power of self-generation on the plane of egoity in that he has reached a higher state that i s free from the limitations of a single line of egoity. The disciple now begins to realize in the very natu re of his being that the \"Self is in all and all in the Self. \" Such a disciple (or Bodhisattva) is taught by the Master in this st ate of being, and the body that he supplies for the energizing of his beloved Father is perfectly unintelligible to us, and can o nly be described as an expanded consciousness of utmost sy mpathy and compassion, which not only strives to blend wit h the life of all beings but also with the One Being in the world for him, the \"Beloved.\" Such a sensing of the Master's Presence is called the Body of Bliss. There is a still higher Perfection, the Own Nature of Masterhood, the \"I Am that I Am\" state. But how sho uld the dim mind of one who is outside imagine the condition of One who is not only Within, but who combines both the Outside and the Within in the Transcendent Unity of the Perfect Ful lness?"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 The Spread of the Gnosis With the consummation of the higher teaching and th e return to earth of the consciousness of the Seer, our treatis e breaks off into a graphic instruction of how the new Gnosis is to be utilized. The Wisdom is no man's property; he who r eceives it holds it in trust for the benefit of the world. Unt il this point, we have moved in the atmosphere of an inner intimate p ersonal instruction, set forth in a form evidently intended only for the few. Indeed, as we find in other treatises emphatic injunctions to keep the teaching secret, we cannot but conclude that such a revered and authoritative document of the Hermeti c school was at one time guarded with the same secrecy. In any case, all things are new for our author; all things have new meanings. He has become a Son of God, instead o f a procession of Fate; he has reached the \"Plain of Tr uth.\" In Christian terms, the Christ has been born in his heart consciously. Henceforth his effort will be to become like unto the Father Himself, to pass from Sonship into the P erfection of perfection, Identity or At-one-ment with the Father . The Meaning of \"Pymander\" Many researchers have already remarked that the nam e \"Pymander\" is formed irregularly in Greek, and this has led to an interesting speculation by Frederick Granger in his commentary where he writes: \"While, however, the na me Pymander does not answer to any Greek original, it is a close transliteration of a Coptic phrase. In the dialect of Upper Egypt 'py-meretre' means 'the witness'. That the Coptic a rticle (py) should be treated as part of the name itself is not unusual. Such a title corresponds very closely in style with the titles of other works of the Corpus Hermeticum , such as The Perfect Word, which is an alternative title of the \"Asclepius.\" T he term Pymander, therefore, on this supposition, contains an allusion to the widely spread legend of Hermes as the witnes s, a legend that is verified for us from many sources. Nonethel ess, the meaning taken in most commentaries is that of \"the Good Shepherd,\" in the sense of Hermes, the Shepherd of Man. This was certainly the idea conveyed to the non-Egyptians by the name, however philologically unsound its form may b e."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 It has been no part of our task to attempt to trace the Hermes idea, for this would have led us too far from our i mmediate subject. There is, however, one element of that tra dition which is of great interest, and to which we may draw the attention of the reader in passing. The beautiful idea of the Ch rist as the \"Good Shepherd\" is familiar to every Christian chil d. Why the Christ is the Shepherd of all men is shown us by th is first of the marvelous treatises of the Corpus Hermeticum . In it we have the universal doctrine apart from any historical do gma, the eternal truth of an ever-recurring fact, and not th e exaggeration of one instance of it. The representation of Christ as the Good Shepherd w as one of the earliest efforts of Christianity, although the prototype was far earlier than Christianity. In fact, it was exce edingly archaic. Statues of Hermes as the Kriophoros, or Hermes with a ram or lamb standing beside him, or in his arms, or on his shoulder, were one of the most favorite subjects for the chis el in Greece. We have specimens dating to the most archaic period of Greek art. Hermes in these archaic statues has a pointed cap and not the winged headdress and sandals of later art. This type in all probability goes back to Chaldean symbolic art, to the bearers of the twelve \"signs of the zodiac\" and the \"sacred animals\" of the stars. These were, in one human correspondence, the twelve \"septs\" or classes of priests. Here we see t hat the Greek tradition itself was not pure Aryan even in its so- called archaic period. Chaldea had given her wisdom to post-diluvi an Greece, even as she had perchance been in relation with Gre ece before the Great Flood. Conclusion Here, then, we have another element in the Hermes i dea. In fact, nowhere do we find a pure line of tradition; in every religion there are blendings and have always been b lendings. There was unconscious syncretism (and conscious als o) long before the days of Alexandria, for unconscious sync retism is as old as our race-bindings. Even as all men are kin, so are popular cults related; and even as the religion of nobler souls is of one paternity, so are the theosophies of all rel igions from one source."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 One of the greatest secrets of the innermost initia ted circles was the grand fact that all the great religions had the ir roots in one mother soil. And it was the spreading of the consci ousness of this stupendous truth that subsequently gave rise to the many conscious attempts to synthesize the various phases of religion, and make \"symphonies\" of apparently contradictory p hilosophical tenets. Modern research, which is essentially criti cal and analytical, and rarely synthetical, classifies all these attempts under the term \"syncretism\" -- a word that it invar iably uses in a depreciatory sense, as characterizing the blending of absolutely incompatible elements in the most uncritical fashio n. But when the pendulum swings once more towards the side of synth esis, as it must do in the coming epoch -- for we are but repea ting today in greater derail what happened in the early centuries -- then scholarship will once more recognize the unity of r eligion under the diversity of creeds and return to the original doct rine of the Hermetic Mysteries.
