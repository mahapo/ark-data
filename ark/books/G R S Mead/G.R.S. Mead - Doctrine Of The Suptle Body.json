THE notion that the physical body of man is as it were the exteriorization of an invisible subtle embodiment of the life of the mind is a very ancient belief. Conjectures concerning it vary with every stage of culture and differ within every stage. But the underlying conception invariably holds its ground, and makes good its claim to be one of the most persistent persuasions of mankind in all ages and climes. It is, however, the prevailing habit of the sceptical rationalism of the present day to dismiss summarily all such beliefs of antiquity as the baseless dreams of a pre- scientific age, and to dump them all indis criminately into the midden of exploded superstitions.

The notion of a subtle embodiment seems admirably fitted to provide a middle ground on which what, at present, are mutually exclusive views, may be focussed and brought into helpful co-operation.

It is beginning to be seen on all sides that the physical, the biological and the psychological activities of man as a unitary reality are so intimately interblended, that no arbitrary selection of any one of these standpoints can provide a satisfactory solu tion of the nature of the concrete whole which human personality presents.

Physical nature is found to be dynamic through and through, even when the method of research still insists upon arbitrarily abstracting the matter of our Great Mother from her life and mind. If then much of what we shall have to adduce about the nature of the subtle embodiment of man from the records of the most brilliant period of philosophic thinking in the ancient Western world, may seem to subjective idealists and abstractionists too materialistic, they would do well to reflect that we are dealing with what invariably purports to be a corporeal entity, and not with the soul proper, much less with the mind, both of which high philosophy asserts to be immaterial realities.

They got at it by the analysis of the whole of living experience without prejudice, by speculating on the phenomena of dreams and visions as well as on the facts of purely objective sense-data, by reasoning on what happened to them without any arbitrary exclusion of everything not given in patent physical perception. They arrived at their conclusions in what many to-day in their fancied superiority may be pleased to regard as an unscientific fashion.

No excuse then need be offered for the following three essays which attempt to give a brief sketch of the most interesting presentation of the subtle body notion in the history of its development in Western tradition. They might perhaps be called studies in Alexandrian psycho-physiology ; for Alexan dria was the chief centre of philosophic culture for the period under review. If, however, it be objected that Alexan drian is not sufficiently precise a term, seeing that this most famous city of the Hellenistic schools was the meeting-ground of many diverse and the battle-ground of many contradictory traditions and move ments of thought, then Platonic may be substituted ; for indubitably the views enunciated are throughout dominated by the spirit of that great tradition in its most highly developed period.

To mention the chief of these only, both on Later Platonisrn, we have now in our hands the excellent works of Mr. Thomas Whittaker 1 and of Dean Inge. 2 Evaluating the work of the school from a purely philosophical point of view, Mr. Whittaker writes (p. 209) : &quot; The Neo-platonic thought is, meta physically, the maturest thought that the European world has seen.

What that value is, in Dr. Inge s judg ment, may be seen by his declaration : &quot; We cannot preserve Platonism without Chris tianity, nor Christianity without Platonism, nor civilization without both &quot; (ii. 227).

It is with this strictly limited point of view that I propose chiefly to deal ; for the general subject is of vast extent, indeed of an encyclopaedic nature. Apart from the vast material setting forth primitive conceits and fancies, as surveyed by the busy industry of anthropological re search, the history of the development of the doctrine of the subtle body by minds of higher culture, even if it were confined solely to Western tradition, would require a very bulky volume ; while its parallel evolu tion in Eastern tradition, even if Indian thought alone, in which it reached its most mature expression, were submitted to review, would demand a still more bulky tome. It may however be of interest to glance for a moment at two of its obscurer aspects in the Occident.

The moderns, as we all know, have gone to the other extreme, and cast out the pair of them with contumely as bastards unworthy to company with the legitimate offspring of their eugenically engendered scientific family. The astral or sidereal religion of antiquity revolved round the central notion of an intimate correspondence between man s psychical and sensible apparatus, or his inner embodiment, and the subtle nature of the universe. The relative positions of the celestial bodies in the sether at any moment were regarded by the most advanced thinkers solely as indices of the harmonious inter action of invisible spheres, with appropriate fields of vital energy. The ground conviction of astral religion held that there was a subtle organon of great nature, an interior economy of the world-soul. Man s nature was so to say an excerpt from this greater nature ; and it was conceived of as a germ or seed as it were of the universal tree of life. Man was the microcosm of the macrocosm."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PROEM 13 Soaring far beyond the dross of vulgar horoscopy, philosophic astral theory set up a ladder of ascent from the earth to the light-world. As it climbed the successive rungs of this scale of ascent, the speculation of sidereal faith rose to ever more sublime heights, and brought such minds as could struggle to the topmost peaks of the mount of contempla tion, into communion with the ever living ideas or realities of the spiritual state which energized in the second degree as the formative principles of the world of becom ing. He who could reach to such com munion, we are told, had firmly planted his feet on what Plato calls the plain of truth. So at any rate did the best of them teach concerning the path of ascent, and such did they declare the end of their endeavour to be.

The general impression made on my own mind by a fairly extensive survey of its literature is that the typical alchemist would sooner commit suicide than commit himself to a plain straightforward statement concerning his art. The alchemists and alchemistical philoso phers were, however, by no means genuine enthusiasts for secrecy ; for then they would have held their tongues and never dipped a pen in ink.

The excuse they proffered in mitigation of the charge brought against their pro cedure was that they were compelled so to act in order to safeguard the inner mysteries of their craft from profanation at the hands of the vulgar, the curious and the unworthy. But this plea cannot be accepted as clearing them from the accusation of thereby also at the same time piling up stumbling-blocks in the way of the serious, the earnest and the worthy.

There can be no doubt that bungling experiments on one s own body, life and mind are fraught with great danger. But in every pursuit of knowledge risks must be taken, if there is to be any progress. The gravamen of the charge against the alchemists is that their elaborate camou flage increased the risks, and led the vast majority of the inexperienced into greater difficulties than they would have had to face if the way had been made clear for them by frank and straightforward statements.

But even as there was a deeper, more vital, side of astrology, a subtler phase intimately bound up with the highest themes of sidereal religion, so there was a supra-physical, vital and psychical side to alchemy a scale of ascent leading finally to man s perfection in spiritual reality. Indeed, with regard to the real work of the craft, its greatest adepts are never weary of asserting that their elements and metals, their apparatuses and operations, are all invariably philosophic.

Thus the wild riot of symbol, myth and allegory in which they delighted, was in tended by the best of them to set forth the sequence of a natural inner process of the life of the soul.

Everything concerning it was wont to be guarded with jealous secresy, and gnosis of this order was strictly reserved for the elect, who had first been thoroughly approved by rigid testing of their courage and character.

We thus find it boldly declared that the things which had hitherto been whispered in the secret places were now to be proclaimed on the house tops.

It came, as so much else came, by means of Latin translations from the Arabic, by way of the Schools of Moorish Spain, which played so important a part in the intellec tual development of Europe after the night of the dark ages. These philosophers and thinkers of Islam derived their culture in the first instance directly from the schools of Hellas.

In the first place I am unaware that any alchemical treatise, or even the hint of one, has as yet been found in hieroglyphic, demotic or coptic script. As to the genuine treatises of the Tris- megistic Hermetic tradition 1 preserved in the Greek corpus, and the excerpts and fragments associated with the honorific title Thrice-greatest Hermes they are entirely innocent of alchemy in the way that the Byzantine texts of the craft present it.

We find gold-making, recipes for substitute alloys feigning gold, quaint prescriptions of the workshops of the craftsmen, intermingled with the high doctrines of a spiritual philosophy. The main burden, indeed, of the exhorta tions of the genuine Zosimus to his pupil, the lady Theosebeia, is that, if she would know the truth, she should betake herself for refuge to Pcemandres the spiritual Shepherd of men, with whom those who were directly taught of God, those known 1 Collection chs anclens Alchimistet grecs, 3 vols., Paris, 1888."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PROEM 27 by the generic title Thrice-greatest Hermes, communed and baptize herself in the life of the Divine Mind.

It seems then only reasonable to reject the gold-making treatises ascribed to our Hermetic gnostic as clearly pseudonymous ; just as is the case with others ; as when, for instance, we find the great names of a Democritus or of an Aristotle filched to father the sorry offspring of far lesser minds, ooncooters not infrequently of recipes that are first cousins to the contents of a magical medicine bag.

In any case, it is sun-clear that the latter has nothing whatever legitimately to do with Thrice-greatest Hermes. But is alchemy in any sense of Egyptian origin ? It may very well be that in its lowest aspect it derived partly, may be even to a large extent, from the workshops of Egyptian craftsmen.

Now the two great wisdom-traditions of antiquity were for the Greeks those of Babylonia and of Egypt.

We shall thus find our quest after the psychical heredity of alchemy leading us to Syria and Hither Asia, to later Babylonian and Chaldsean sources, blended with Persian Magian traditions. If Greek genius, in the Hellenistic period, philosophized the ancient wisdom of Egypt, it also philosophized this Irano-Babylonian mystical syncretism. Indeed, if we except Plotinus on the purely negative ground that the Enneads make scant reference to the subject, all of the philosophers of the Later Platonic school, as is well known, took quite an absorbing interest in the mystery-lore enshrined in what were most generally referred to as the Chalda3an Oracles. 1 1 See my Chaldcean Oracles, 2 vols., London, 1908, in the series Echoes from the Gnosis,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"30 THE SUBTLE BODY In 1894 Kroll proved in masterly fashion that all the scattered fragments of quota tions, accepted as genuine and referred to this origin in Neoplatonic writings, were taken from one source.

Among other things this famous poem sets forth a highly mystical doctrine con cerning the nature of the subtle body, and of the soul and mind of man, and purports to reveal the mystery of the divine paternal fire and the secret of the life of the great mother.

Some of the Christian Gnostic schools, moreover, in like fashion supply us with indications of the psychical heredity of the higher alchemy ; and this too not obscurely, but sometimes very plainly, in that they employ a symbolism identical with that of the later art.

And in another we read of the mysterious stone which has its mystical implications set forth by free use of quotations from both the Old and the New Testaments.

This led to the revolt of Palestinian Jewry under Mattathias and his heroic sons the Macca bees ; and thereafter the name of Antiochus stood for all that was accursed in the history of the Hebrews.

Some held that it could ; others contended that it was only its impurities that could be cast off, as we shall see when we come to treat of what they called the luciform or radiant vehicle. That there were many different views among the philosophical schools in general, not only on the more transcendental rela tionships of the soul, but also on the inferior connection between soul and body, may be seen from Philoponus (9, 35f. ; 10, 4!. 1 ), to 3 The references are to Philoponi in Arittotelii de Anima, ed.

As to the vegetative soul, it has its existence in the physical body only and perishes together with it. There is no spirit-body in plants (17, 8f.).

As to the chastisements in Hades, they cannot really purify the soul ; for the soul being self-moved must purify itself of its own free-will, and must, therefore, return to earth for this purpose. The chastise ments are simply for the purpose of turning it to itself, causing it to repent, or wean itself from sympathy with the things of generation (17, 2518, 25). As to the inferior means of purification and the rationale of phantasms of the deceased, Philoponus has the following (19, 24ff.) : &quot; Now they say that the spirit-body also has somewhat of the vegetative life, for it 1 This view differs somewhat from that of the Trismegistic school (see p. 51 above)."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"68 THE SUBTLE BODY also is nourished, not however in the same way as this [gross body] , but by means of vapours, not by parts [i.e. by separate organs] , but the whole of it through the whole [as one organism] , so to say, just like a sponge.

In brief, it is the spirit-body that is the unitary or common sense-organ (433, 34). This, Philoponus says, is the doctrine of both Aristotle and the Platonici. Thus he tells us (488, 25) that, according to Aristotle : &quot; The first sensory, in which is the sensing power, is i the spirit, the substrate of the irrational soul ; for in this the sense has first of all its being. &quot; Eyes, ears and nostrils are sense-organs only, they do not come first, for the feeling soul is not in them.

This ground is the spirituous body. Thus the various orders of sensible phenomena, though different from one another, occur in the spirituous body, now 1 Cp. 201, 31 : &quot; In the spirit, however, the psychic powers are disposed, as are the vegetative in trees, the wlole of them being spread throughout the whole spirit.&quot;"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"72 THE SUBTLE BODY in one portion, now in another of it.

Not only Paul but many other early Christian mystics, notably the Gnostics, held views that we can hardly doubt were based on experience, and which seem to throw light on the problem. Now it is to be noted that Tertullian (D. R. C. 19) is specially annoyed with those whom he opposes (pars diversa), because they say the resurrection is to be taken in a spiritual sense. These he stigmatises as allegorists, and contends that they would make it all a purely figurative thing.

They seem, however, in their general outlines, not to have been secret teachings, but widely proclaimed ; for he continues : &quot; Indeed the majority (plerique), though claiming that there is a resurrection of the soul after its departure [from the body] , interpret the coming forth from the grave as escaping from the * world, inasmuch as the world is the dwelling place of the dead that is, of those who know not God ; or even as the escape from the body"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"128 THE SUBTLE BODY itself, because the body also like a grave keeps the soul shut up in the death of the worldly life.&quot; But for the spiritually experienced this was a very real happening and not an arbitrary interpretation, as Tertullian would have it. In some schools indeed it was associated with the first true initiation into the arcana of the spiritual life. If, for instance, we interpret the short passage of Irenseus (I. xxiii. 5) which sum marises the teachings of the Gnostic Menauder, by the light of recent religio- historical research and by what we know generally of the nature of the main psychology of the Gnostic schools, the view of the majority will be more clearly seen. Menander, who was strongly imbued with Chaldaeo-Magian mystery-lore, and stood on the borderland between it and general Christian doctrines, taught that the chief end of the gnosis was the overcoming of the world and its * rulers.

For it was believed to bestow upon the recipient an earnest of immortality and of eternal youth ; and this could not very well apply to the physical body. The clearest form of the teaching to which Tertullian refers, however, is to be found in the composite Naassene Document quoted by Hippolytus (v. 7 ff.). 1 Speaking of the primal Spiritual Man, the Pagan commentator (who is certainly pre-Christian) of the Greek mystery-hymn that forms the text of the whole exposition, tells us that this Immortal Man is buried in mortal man.

The Pagan commentator continues: &quot; The same Phrygians again call this very same 1 Cp. what underlies Mt. xxiii. 27, Lk. xi. 44 and Acts xxiii. 3. s Cp. \\rhat underlies Mt. xxvii. 52, 53."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE RESURRECTION-BODY 131 [Man or man], after the transformation, God [or a god] .&quot; And on this the Christian writer notes : &quot; For he becomes God when, rising from the Dead, through such a Gate, he shall pass into Heaven.&quot; The mystery of divinising (apotheosis) or transcending death (atlianasia) was not, however, to be deferred to post-mortem existence, though it had to be preceded by a mystical death. It was a mystery wrought in the living body of a man. With such spiritual rites and operations the members of most of the Christian Gnostic schools seem to have been familiar. What, however, many of them sought to do was to introduce a unique element in the case of Jesus. But here naturally there was much earnest debate. Thus we are told that even in one and the same school opinion was divided as to the mystery of the spiritual resurrection in the case of Jesus. The widespread Valentinian movement was so divided. In its Western tradition (Hipp., vi. 35) Jesus was said to have had, like all men, a"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"182 THE SUBTLE BODY psychic body, that is a fleshly, mortal vehicle of the soul. The resurrection from the dead was operated by the baptism of the Spirit. The popular story of the descent of the dove signified the descent of the Spirit, which they regarded in this con nection as the Logos or Supernal Wisdom. The descent of the Spirit was the resurrec tion or coming to life and consciousness in the mortal man of the Spiritual Man. The Eastern tradition, on the other hand, refined the uniqueness of Jesus to the utmost. They contended that the body of Jesus already from birth was the spiritual body. Now though this body from one point of view was the most real of all sub stantial things, from the physical standpoint it was an appearance, and therefore the Eastern Valentinians were regarded as extreme docetists.

According to Paul the * spiritual body is not a body of pure spirit, which would be, philosophically speaking, an absolute con tradiction in terms ; but a body capable by its purity of manifesting the immediate power of the Spirit. This, the fleshly, psychic body, he believed, could not do. The spiritual body was a glory, a body of power. In the Gnostic post-resurrectional Gospel, known as Pistis Sophia, we have a magnifi cent description of the perfect body of glory of the Master, the vesture of light, which is practically the vehicle of all the supernal powers of the Universe. In the Syrian Gnostic Hymn of the Soul, or Hymn of the Pearl, the robe of glory is sealed with the names or powers of the divine hierarchy from the King of kings downwards."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"184 THE SUBTLE BODY Many of these sublime descriptions are, no doubt, largely conditioned by the feeling that the physical body is a thing of dis honour or, at any rate, of humiliation. But this cannot really be so as viewed in the greater life. And so, in spite of the crudity of the belief in the resurrection of the actual physical body, there seems to be at the back of it the dim intuition of a certain great truth namely, that the whole man must embrace the corporeal as well as the psychic, the mental and the spiritual. Did the mystics then believe that there was an absolute divorcement in every sense between the physical or material vehicle and the spiritual body of the resurrection ? It seems already pretty evident that they did not do so. Tertullian s contention that the interpre tation he opposes is merely what might be termed the reification of a metaphor, or even at best an immaterial moral regen eration, as many may regard it to-day, is not, apparently, what was believed.

Was this, then, simply some subtle body of identical or even somewhat changed physical form, capable of manifesting more extended powers than the flesh ? Yes and No. It was not a body in any order of subtle bodies in immediate sequence with the physical body, of which so much is heard among the psychics of all ages. It was rather the source of every possibility of embodiment, the germ-ground, or seminarium, from which all such bodies could be produced.

The great change wrought at the resurrection was fundamental. It freed man from the constraints of fate, from the dominion of the rulers. Fortunately we possess a mystery-ritual, or rather the ritual of a mystic rite of personal religion, that gives us clear indica tions of the direction in which we should look to envisage the nature of this resurrec tion-body.
