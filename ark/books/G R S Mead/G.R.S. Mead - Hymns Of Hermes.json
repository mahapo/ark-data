Under this general title it is proposed to publish a series of small volumes, drawn from, or based upon, the mystic, theosophic and gnostic writings of the ancients, so as to make more easily audible for the ever-widening circle of those who love such things, some echoes of the mystic experiences and initiatory lore of their spiritual ancestry. There are many who love the life of the spirit, and who long for the light of gnostic illumination, but who are not sufficiently equipped to study the writings of the ancients at first hand, or to follow the labours of scholars unaided. These little volumes are therefore intended to serve as introduction to the study of the more difficult literature of the subject, and it is hoped that at the same time they may become for some, who have, as yet, not even heard of the Gnosis, stepping-stones to higher things.

Clement of Alexandria tells us that the whole of the religious philosophy that is, the wisdom, discipline and multi farious arts and sciences of the Egyptian priesthood was contained in the Books of Hermes, that is of Thoth. These Books, he informs us further, were classified under forty-two heads and divided into a number of groups according to the various septs or divisions of the priests. In describing a certain sacred cere monial a procession of priests in their various orders Clement tells us that it was headed by a representative of the order of Singers, who were distinguished by appropriate symbols of music, some of which apparently were carried in the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":".

These Singers had to make themselves masters of, that is, learn by heart, two of the divisions of the Books of Hermes, namely, those which contained collec tions of Hymns in Honour of the Gods or of God, and Encomia or Hymns in Praise of the Kings (iii., 222). Many specimens of similar hymns in praise of the Gods are preserved to us in Egyptian inscriptions and papyri, and some of them are most noble out-pourings of the soul in praise of the majesty and transcendency of the Supreme, in terms that may be not unfavourably compared with similar praise-giving in other great scriptures. But, alas ! the hymn-books of Thoth, to which Clement refers, are lost to us. He may, of course, have been mistaken in so definitely designating them, just as he was indubitably mistaken in thinking that they were collections of hymns composed by a single individual, Hermes. 10"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The grandiose conception of Thoth J5 s as the inspirer of all sacred writings and O F the teacher of all religion and philo- HERMES. sophy was Egyptian and not Greek ; and it was but a sorry equivalent that the Greeks could find in their own pantheon when, in the change of God- names, they were forced to &quot; translate &quot; &quot;Thoth&quot; by &quot;Hermes.&quot; Thoth, as the inspirer of all sacred writings and the president of all priestly discipline, was, as Jamblichus tells us, a name which was held by the Egyptians to be &quot; common to all priests &quot; that is to say, every priest as priest was a Thoth, because he showed forth in his sacred office some characteristic or other of the Great Priest or Master Hierophant among the Gods whose earthly name was Thoth Tehuti.

But here again, unfortunately, we have no collection of such hymns preserved to us ; and all we can do is to gather up the fragments that remain, scattered through the pages of the Trismegistic literature which have escaped the jealousy of an exclusive bibliolatry.

This majestic Reality or Essence of Certitude was conceived of as a limitless Presence, or Person, of Light and Life and Goodness, which enwrapped the contemplative mind of the pious wor shipper of God or the Good, of the single- hearted lover of the Beautiful, and of the unwearied striver for the knowledge of the True.

The soil must be cleared of tares and ploughed, before it can be sown.

Indeed this is the basis of all liturgy and cult, even in their crudest forms or reflections in the dreams of men s sleeping hearts. But the Trismegistic writings are dealing with the self-con scious realization of true Gnostic Passion, where feeling has to be consciously transmuted into knowledge.

The Isis of his spiritual nature is still weeping and mourning, gathering them together, await ing the day of the New Dawn, when the last member, the organ of Gnosis, shall complete the taxis, or order, or band of his members, and the New Man shall arise from the dead.

Man in limitation is two-fold, even as are his physical limbs ; man in freedom as cosmicly configured is two in one in all things. And therefore when this &quot; change of gnostic tendency &quot; is wrought, there is a marvellous transmutation of the whole nature. He abandons his Typhonic passions, the energizings of the nature that has battled with God, in order that what the anonymous writer of that mystic masterpiece The Dream of Rdvan, so finely calls the &quot; Divine Catastrophe &quot; may be precipitated, and the Titan in him may be the more rapidly destroyed, or rather transmuted into the God."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"VM For though these passions now seem OP to us to be of the &quot; Devil,&quot; and though HERMES, we look upon them as born of powers that fight against God, they are not really evil ; they are the experiences in our nature of the natural energies of the Divine Harmony that mysterious En gine of Fate, which is the seven-fold means of manifestation, according to our Trismegistic tradition. For the Divine Harmony is the creative instrument of the Divine Energy, that perpetually produces forms in substance for consciousness, and so gradually perfects a form that shall be capable of imaging forth the Perfect Man. The natural energies that have been hitherto working through him uncon sciously, in order that through form self-consciousness may come to birth, are, however, regarded by the neophyte, in the first stages of his gnostic birth, as inimical ; they have woven for him garments that have brought experience, but which now seem rags that he would 20"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"ain strip off, in order that he may put THE on new robes of power and majesty, and O J M so exchange the sackcloth of the slave HERMES. for the raiment of the King.

This gnostic change is in our treatise described by the Great Mind teaching the little mind, as following on the stripping off of the vices of the soul, which are said to arise from the downward mode of the energies of the seven spheres of the Harmony of Fate. The subsequent beati fication is set forth in the following graphic declaration : &quot; And then, with all the energizing of the Harmony stript from him, he 21"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"HYMNS cometn to tnat nature which belongs OF unto the Eighth, and there with those HERMES, that are hymneth the Father. &quot; They who are there welcome his coming there with joy ; and he, made like to them that sojourn there, doth further hear the Powers who are above the nature that belongs unto the Eighth, singing their songs of praise to God in language of their own. &quot; And then they, in a band, go to the Father home ; of their own selves they make surrender of themselves to Powers, and thus becoming Powers they are in God. This the good end for those who have gained Gnosis to be made one with God&quot; (ii., 16). This is the change of gnostic tendency that is wrought in the nature of one who passes from the stage of ordinary man, which Hermes characterizes as a &quot; pro cession of Fate,&quot; to that true manhood which leads finally to Godship.

Now the sekhem is generally translated &quot; power,&quot; but we have no description of it whereby we may satisfactorily check the translation ; and so I would suggest that the khaibit, though generally translated &quot; shadow &quot; (i., 89), is perhaps the mystery to which our text refers, for &quot; in the teaching of Egypt, around the radiant being [perhaps the ren or name], which in its regenerate life could assimilate itself to the glory of the Godhead, was formed the khaibit, or luminous atmosphere, consisting of a series of ethereal envelopes, at once shading and diffusing its flaming lustre, as the earth s atmosphere shades and diffuses the solar rays &quot; (i., 76).

And Plutarch tells us that linen was worn by the priests &quot; on account of the colour which the flax in flower sends forth, resembling the ethereal radiance that sur rounds the cosmos &quot; (i., 265). The same mystery is shown forth in the marvellous passage which describes the transfiguration of Jesus in the Gnostic gospel known as the Pistis Sophia, which is of almost pure Egyptian tradition. It is the mystic description of a wonderful metamorphosis or transformation that is wrought in the inner nature of the Master, who has ascended to clothe himself with the Robe of Glory, and who returns to the consciousness of his lower powers, or disciples, clad in his Robe of Power. 24"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"They saw Jesus descending shining THE exceedingly ; there was no measure to QF M the light which surrounded him, for he HERMES, shone more brightly than when he had ascended into the heavens, so that it is impossible for any in this world to de scribe the light in which he was.

As yet, how ever, the newly born cannot understand or bear, their song, for they sing in a language of their own, there being many tongues of angels and archangels, of daimones and gods in their many grades.

It is thus evident that our Hymns of Hermes are in direct contact with a tradition which regarded the spiritual life as a perpetual service of song ; and this is quite in keeping with the belief of the Egyptians that man was created for the sole purpose of worshipping the Gods and rendering them pious service. The whole duty of man was thus conceived of as an utterance of &quot; true words &quot; or a continual singing of a song of harmony of thought and word and deed, whereby man grew like unto the Gods, and so at last becoming a God was with the Great God in the &quot; Boat of 28"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"the millions of Years,&quot; or &quot; Barque of J NS the .^Eons,&quot; in other words, was safe for F eternity.

This Knowing, or Gnosis, is achieved by the Single Sense of the intelligence ; not by sense alone, nor by mind alone, but by a means superior to both, in which the twain blend in Gnosis, and so become conscious with a new consciousness, or self-knowledge, of the Light of God, or the Over-mind of all things, and of the Life of God, or the Over-Soul of all things, which latter is graphically described as the &quot;Fecund Womb that giveth birth to every nature.&quot; This is the Gnosis of the Divine as the Pleroma, or Fullness, which is replete with the Conception of universal nature from God Himself. Finally, God is praised for being known as the Eternal Constancy, Stability, Dura tion, Unchangeableness, Sameness.

What noble hymns are these four, hymns worthy of all that is best in man, and all that is worthiest in the true worshipper of God ! If only we had a psalter of such psalms, as doubtless once existed in this excellent community of servants of God and Gnostic liturgists ! But alas ! while the indifference of time has preserved for us so much of the classical writers that we could not un- frequently well spare, the jealousy of Providence has kept from us the major part of the most beautiful monuments of man s gnostic genius perchance, how ever, because the world was not ready to appreciate them.

We have no more Hymns of Hermes wherewith to make glad the hearts of our readers as we would fain hope they have gladdened them but we will add another hymn of so like a nature that it might very well have been penned by a Hermes of the Trismegistic faith. It is &quot; A Song of Praise to the .Eon,&quot; which is said to have been inscribed on a &quot; secret tablet,&quot; by some unknown Brother of a forgotten Order, perhaps one of the Communities of the sEon the Highest and Supercelestial One which Philo of Byblos, in the second half of the first century of our era, tells us were in existence in Phoenicia in his day, and doubtless were also existing in Egypt (i., 403).

The ^Eon is the Invisible Intelligible Cosmos, the All-Cosmos of Ethereal Spirit or Quintessence, as distinguished from the Sensible Cosmos of the four Great Elements, pure Fire and Air and Water and Earth, and not our mixed elements. The reader has only to compare the opening and closing sentences of &quot; The Secret Hymnody &quot; with the first para graph of our hymn to see that we are in precisely the same circle of ideas. Heaven, Earth and the Abyss, the three worlds, through which the Spirit, like Vishnu in the Purana s, takes &quot;three strides. &quot; It is this Spirit, the Great Breath of Life, that is the out-breath and in-breath of man s manifold existences.

The ^Eon is neither Beginning nor End, but both ; for all the Spheres of Being which it energizes, end where they begin, and begin where they end they dance in eternal revolution, for their &quot; everlasting revelling-place &quot; is in the Vortex of the Ceaseless Liturgy, or Service, of the Elements.

Therefore, the Brethren and Sisters of this community of gnostic servants of God rightly praise all the Gods, for these Gods are the true community of saints or holy ones in Heaven, even as the Brethren and Sisters are endeavouring to become saints on earth, holy as they are holy.
