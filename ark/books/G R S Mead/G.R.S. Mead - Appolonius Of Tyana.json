If it be a subject of lasting regret that no non-Christian w riter of the first century had sufficient intuition of the future to r ecord even a line of information concerning the birth and growth of what was to be the religion of the Western world, equally di sappointing is it to find so little definite information of the ge neral social and religious conditions of the time. The rulers and th e wars of the Empire seem to have formed the chief interest of th e historiographers of the succeeding century, and eve n in this department of political history, though p. 2 the public acts of the Emperors may be fairly well known, for we can check them by records and inscriptions, when we come to their private acts and motives we find ourselves no longer on the ground of history, but for the most part in the atmosphere of prejudice, scandal, and speculation. The political acts of Emperors and their officers, however, can at best t hrow but a dim side-light on the general social conditions of the time, while they shed no light at all on the religious conditio ns, except so far as these in any particular contacted the domain of politics. As well might we seek to reconstruct a picture of the religious life of the time from Imperial acts and rescripts, as en deavour to glean any idea of the intimate religion of this cou ntry from a perusal of statute books or reports of Parliamentar y debates. The Roman histories so-called, to which we have so far been accustomed, cannot help us in the reconstruction of a picture of the environment into which, on the one hand, Paul l ed the new faith in Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome; and in which , on the other, it already found itself in the districts bor dering on the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 south-east of the Mediterranean. It is only by piec ing together laboriously isolated scraps of information and frag ments of inscriptions, that we become aware of the existence of the life of a world of religious associations and private cults which existed at p. 3 this period. Not that even so we have any very dire ct information of what went on in these associations, guilds, and brotherhoods; but we have sufficient evidence to ma ke us keenly regret the absence of further knowledge. Difficult as this field is to till, it is exceeding ly fertile in interest, and it is to be regretted that comparatively so lit tle work has as yet been done in it; and that, as is so frequently the case, the work which has been done is, for the most part, not accessible to the English reader. What work has been done on this special subject may be seen from the bibliographical note a ppended to this essay, in which is given a list of books and a rticles treating of the religious associations among the Greeks and Romans. But if we seek to obtain a general view of the conditio n of religious affairs in the first century we find ourselves with out a reliable guide; for of works dealing with this particular su bject there are few, and from them we learn little that does not im mediately concern, or is thought to concern, Christianity; wh ereas, it is just the state of the non-Christian religious world abou t which, in the present case, we desire to be informed. If, for instance, the reader turn to works of gener al history, such as Merivale's History of the Romans under the Empir e (London; last ed. 1865), he will find, it is true, in chap. iv., a description p. 4 of the state of religion up to the death of Nero, b ut he will be little wiser for perusing it. If he turn to Hermann Schiller's Geschichte der römischen Kaiserreichs unter der Reg ierung des Nero (Berlin; 1872), he will find much reason for d iscarding the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 vulgar opinions about the monstrous crimes imputed to Nero, as indeed he might do by reading in English G. H. Lewe s’ article \"Was Nero a Monster?\" (Cornhill Magazine; July, 186 3)—and he will also find (bk. IV. chap. iii.) a general vi ew of the religion and philosophy of the time which is far more intell igent than that of Merivale's; but all is still very vague and unsatisfactory, and we feel ourselves still outside the intimate li fe of the philosophers and religionists of the first century. If, again, he turn to the latest writers of Church history who have treated this particular question, he will find that they are occupied entirely with the contact of the Christian Church with the Roman Empire, and only incidentally give us any information of the nature of which we are in search . On this special ground C. J. Neumann, in his careful study Der römische Staat and die allgemeine Kirche bis auf Diocletian (Leipzig; 1890), is interesting; while Prof. W. M. Ramsay, in The Church in the Roman Empire before A . D . 170 (London; 1893), is extraordinary, for he endeavours to interpret Roman history by the p. 5 [paragraph continues] New Testament documents, the dates of the majority of which are so hotly disputed. But, you may say, what has all this to do with Apol lonius of Tyana? The answer is simple: Apollonius lived in th e first century; his work lay precisely among these religio us associations, colleges, and guilds. A knowledge of them and their nature would give us the natural environment of a great part of his life; and information as to their condi tion in the first century would perhaps help us the better to underst and some of the reasons for the task which he attempted. If, however, it were only the life and endeavours o f Apollonius which would be illuminated by this knowledge, we co uld understand why so little effort has been spent in t his direction; for the character of the Tyanean, as we shall see, has since the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 fourth century been regarded with little favour eve n by the few, while the many have been taught to look upon our ph ilosopher not only as a charlatan, but even as an anti-Christ . But when it is just a knowledge of these religious associations an d orders which would throw a flood of light on the earliest evolution of Christianity, not only with regard to the Pauline c ommunities, but also with regard to those schools which were su bsequently condemned as heretical, it is astonishing that we p. 6 have had no more satisfactory work done on the subj ect. It may be said, however, that this information is n ot forthcoming simply because it is unprocurable. To a large exten t this is true; nevertheless, a great deal more could be done than has as yet been attempted, and the results of research in spec ial directions and in the byways of history could be combined, so that the non- specialist could obtain some general idea of the re ligious conditions of the times, and so be less inclined to join in the now stereotyped condemnation of all non-Jewish or non-C hristian moral and religious effort in the Roman Empire of t he first century. But the reader may retort: Things social and religi ous in those days must have been in a very parlous state, for, a s this essay shows, Apollonius himself spent the major part of h is life in trying to reform the institutions and cults of the Empire. To this we answer: No doubt there was much to reform, and w hen is there not? But it would not only be not generous, b ut distinctly mischievous for us to judge our fellows of those da ys solely by the lofty standard of an ideal morality, or even to scale them against the weight of our own supposed virtues and knowledge. Our point is not that there was nothing to reform, far from that, but that the wholesale p. 7"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 accusations of depravity brought against the times will not bear impartial investigation. On the contrary, there was much good material ready to be worked up in many ways, and if there had not been, how could there among other things have b een any Christianity? The Roman Empire was at the zenith of its power, an d had there not been many admirable administrators and men of w orth in the governing caste, such a political consummation coul d never have been reached and maintained. Moreover, as ever previously in the ancient world, religious liberty was guaranteed, and where we find persecution, as in th e reigns of Nero and Domitian, it must be set down to political and not to theological reasons. Setting aside the disputed que stion of the persecution of the Christians under Domitian, the N eronian persecution was directed against those whom the Imp erial power regarded as Jewish political revolutionaries. So, t oo, when we find the philosophers imprisoned or banished from R ome during these two reigns, it was not because they were phil osophers, but because the ideal of some of them was the restorati on of the Republic, and this rendered them obnoxious to the c harge not only of being political malcontents, but also of ac tively plotting against the Emperor's majestas . Apollonius, however, was throughout a warm supporter of p. 8 monarchical rule. When, then, we hear of the philos ophers being banished from Rome or being cast into prison, we mu st remember that this was not a wholesale persecution of philosophy throughout the Empire; and when we say t hat some of them desired to restore the Republic, we should remember that the vast majority of them refrained from polit ics, and especially was this the case with the disciples of the religio- philosophical schools "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 THE RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND COMMUNITIES OF THE FIRST CENTURY I N the domain of religion it is quite true that the s tate cults and national institutions throughout the Empire were al most without exception in a parlous state, and it is to be notic ed that Apollonius devoted much time and labour to reviving and purifying them. Indeed, their strength had long lef t the general state-institutions of religion, where all was now p erfunctory; but so far from there being no religious life in the la nd, in proportion as the official cultus and ancestral ins titutions afforded no real satisfaction to their religious ne eds, the more earnestly did the people devote themselves to priva te cults, and eagerly baptised themselves in all that flood of re ligious enthusiasm which flowed in with ever increasing vol ume from the East. Indubitably in all this fermentation ther e were many excesses, according to our present notions of relig ious decorum, and also grievous p. 10 abuses; but at the same time in it many found due s atisfaction for their religious emotions, and, if we except tho se cults which were distinctly vicious, we have to a large extent before us in popular circles the spectacle of what, in their las t analysis, are similar phenomena to those enthusiasms which in our own day may be frequently witnessed among such sects as the Shakers or Ranters, and at the general revival meetings of the uninstructed. It is not, however, to be thought that the private cults and the doings of the religious associations were all of th is nature or confined to this class; far from it. There were rel igious brotherhoods, communities, and clubs— thiasi , erani , and orge ō nes —of all sorts and conditions. There were also mutua l benefit societies, burial clubs, and dining compani es, the prototypes of our present-day Masonic bodies, Oddfe llows, and the rest. These religious associations were not onl y private in the sense that they were not maintained by the State, b ut also for the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 most part they were private in the sense that what they did was kept secret, and this is perhaps the main reason wh y we have so defective a record of them. Among them are to be numbered not only the lower fo rms of mystery-cultus of various kinds, but also the great er ones, such as the p. 11 [paragraph continues] Phrygian, Bacchic, Isiac, and Mithriac Mysteries, which were spread everywhere throughout the Empire. The famous Eleusinia were, however, still u nder the ægis of the State, but though so famous were, as a state-cultus, far more perfunctory. It is, moreover, not to be thought that the great t ypes of mystery- cultus above mentioned were uniform even among them selves. There were not only various degrees and grades with in them, but also in all probability many forms of each line of tradition, good, bad, and indifferent. For instance, we know t hat it was considered de rigueur for every respectable citizen of Athens to be initiated into the Eleusinia, and therefore the tests could not have been very stringent; whereas in the most recen t work on the subject, De Apuleio Isiacorum Mysteriorum Teste (Leyden; 1900), Dr. K. H. E. De Jong shows that in one form of the Isiac Mysteries the candidate was invited to initiation b y means of dream; that is to say, he had to be psychically imp ressionable before his acceptance. Here, then, we have a vast intermediate ground for religious exercise between the most popular and undisciplined forms of private cults and the highest forms, which could on ly be approached through the discipline and training of t he philosophic life. The higher side of these p. 12"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 mystery-institutions aroused the enthusiasm of all that was best in antiquity, and unstinted praise was given to one or another form of them by the greatest thinkers and writers o f Greece and Rome; so that we cannot but think that here the ins tructed found that satisfaction for their religious needs which w as necessary not only for those who could not rise into the keen air of pure reason, but also for those who had climbed so high upon the heights of reason that they could catch a glimpse o f the other side. The official cults were notoriously unable to give them this satisfaction, and were only tolerated by the instru cted as an aid for the people and a means of preserving the tradit ional life of the city or state. By common consent the most virtuous livers of Greec e were the members of the Pythagorean schools, both men and wo men. After the death of their founder the Pythagoreans s eem to have gradually blended with the Orphic communities, and the \"Orphic life\" was the recognised term for a life of purity and self-denial. We also know that the Orphics, and the refore the Pythagoreans, were actively engaged in the reformat ion, or even the entire reforming, of the Baccho-Eleusinian rite s; they seem to have brought back the pure side of the Bacchic c ult with their reinstitution or reimportation of the Iacchic p. 13 mysteries, and it is very evident that such stern l ivers and deep thinkers could not have been contented with a low f orm of cult. Their influence also spread far and wide in general Bacchic circles, so that we find Euripides putting the foll owing words into the mouth of a chorus of Bacchic initiates: \"C lad in white robes I speed me from the genesis of mortal men, an d never more approach the vase of death, for I have done wi th eating food that ever housed a soul.\" * Such words could well be put into the mouth of a Brahman or Buddhist ascetic, ea ger to escape from the bonds of Sam ̇ s ā ra; and such men cannot therefore justly be classed together indiscriminate ly with ribald revellers—the general mind-picture of a Bacchic com pany."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 But, some one may say, Euripides and the Pythagorea ns and Orphics are no evidence for the first century; what ever good there may have been in such schools and communities , it had ceased long before. On the contrary, the evidence i s all against this objection. Philo, writing about 25 A . D ., tells us that in his day numerous groups of men, who in all respects led this life of religion, who abandoned their property, retired fro m the world and devoted themselves entirely to the search for w isdom and the cultivation p. 14 of virtue, were scattered far and wide throughout t he world. In his treatise, On the Contemplative Life, he writes: \"This natural class of men is to be found in many parts of the in habited world, both the Grecian and non-Grecian world, sharing in the perfect good. In Egypt there are crowds of them in every pr ovince, or nome as they call it, and especially round Alexandr ia.\" This is a most important statement, for if there were so many devoted to the religious life at this time, it follows that th e age was not one of unmixed depravity. It is not, however, to be thought that these commun ities were all of an exactly similar nature, or of one and the sam e origin, least of all that they were all Therapeut or Essene. We h ave only to remember the various lines of descent of the doctri nes held by the innumerable schools classed together as Gnostic , as sketched in my recent work, Fragments of a Faith Forgotten, and to turn to the beautiful treatises of the Hermetic schools, to persuade us that in the first century the striving after the re ligious and philosophic life was wide-spread and various. We are not, however, among those who believe that t he origin of the Therapeut communities of Philo and of the Es senes of Philo and Josephus is to be traced to Orphic and Py thagorean influence. The question of precise p. 15"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 origin is as yet beyond the power of historical res earch, and we are not of those who would exaggerate one element o f the mass into a universal source. But when we remember the e xistence of all these so widely scattered communities in the fi rst century, when we study the imperfect but important record of the very numerous schools and brotherhoods of a like nature which came into intimate contact with Christianity in its orig ins, we cannot but feel that there was the leaven of a strong reli gious life working in many parts of the Empire. Our great difficulty is that these communities, bro therhoods, and associations kept themselves apart, and with rare e xceptions left no records of their intimate practices and beliefs, or if they left any it has been destroyed or lost. For the most par t then we have to rely upon general indications of a very superfic ial character. But this imperfect record is no justification for u s to deny or ignore their existence and the intensity of their e ndeavours; and a history which purports to paint a picture of the times is utterly insufficient so long as it omits this most vital su bject from its canvas. Among such surroundings as these Apollonius moved; but how little does his biographer seem to have been aware of the fact? Philostratus has a rhetorician's appreciation of a philosophical p. 16 court life, but no feeling for the life of religion . It is only indirectly that the Life of Apollonius, as it is no w depicted, can throw any light on these most interesting communiti es, but even an occasional side-light is precious where all is i n such obscurity. Were it but possible to enter into the l iving memory of Apollonius, and see with his eyes the things he saw when he lived nineteen hundred years ago, what an enormousl y interesting page of the world's history could be re covered! He not only traversed all the countries where the new faith was taking root, but he lived for years in most of them , and was intimately acquainted with numbers of mystic commun ities in"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Egypt, Arabia, and Syria. Surely he must have visit ed some of the earliest Christian communities as well, must ev en have conversed with some of the \"disciples of the Lord\"! And yet no word is breathed of this, not one single scrap of i nformation on these points do we glean from what is recorded of h im. Surely he must have met with Paul, if not elsewhere, then at Rome, in 66, when he had to leave because of the edict of ba nishment against the philosophers, the very year according t o some when Paul was beheaded! Footnotes 13:* From a fragment of The Cretans. See Lobeck's Aglaophamus, p. 622. INDIA AND GREECE T HERE is, however, another reason why Apollonius is of importance to us. He was an enthusiastic admirer of the wisdom of India. Here again a subject of wide interest ope ns up. What influences, if any, had Brahmanism and Buddhism on Western thought in these early years? It is strongly assert ed by some that they had great influence; it is as strongly denied by others that they had any influence at all. It is, therefore, ap parent that there is no really indisputable evidence on the subject. Just as some would ascribe the constitution of the Essene and Therapeut communities to Pythagorean influence, so others would ascribe their origin to Buddhist propaganda; and not only would they trace this influence in the Essene tenet s and practices, but they would even refer the general te aching of the Christ to a Buddhist source in a Jewish monotheisti c setting. Not only so, but some would have it"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 p. 18 that two centuries before the direct general contac t of Greece with India, brought about by the conquests of Alexa nder, India through Pythagoras strongly and lastingly influence d all subsequent Greek thought. The question can certainly not be settled by hasty affirmation or denial; it requires not only a wide knowledge of ge neral history and a minute study of scattered and imperfect indic ations of thought and practice, but also a fine appreciation of the correct value of indirect evidence, for of direct testimony there is none of a really decisive nature. To such high qualifica tions we can make no pretension, and our highest ambition is sim ply to give a few very general indications of the nature of the s ubject. It is plainly asserted by the ancient Greeks that P ythagoras went to India, but as the statement is made by Neo-Pytha gorean and Neo-Platonic writers subsequent to the time of Apol lonius, it is objected that the travels of the Tyanean suggested not only this item in the biography of the great Samian but sever al others, or even that Apollonius himself in his Life of Pythago ras was father of the rumour. The close resemblance, howeve r, between many of the features of Pythagorean discipline and doctrine and Indo-Aryan thought and practice, make us p. 19 hesitate entirely to reject the possibility of Pyth agoras having visited ancient Ā ry ā varta. And even if we cannot go so far as to entertain the possibility of direct personal contact, there has to be taken into consideration the fact that Pherecydes, the master of Pythagoras, may have been acquainted with some of the main ideas of Vaid ic lore. Pherecydes taught at Ephesus, but was himself most probably a Persian, and it is quite credible that a learned As iatic, teaching a mystic philosophy and basing his doctrine upon the idea of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 rebirth, may have had some indirect, if not direct, knowledge of Indo-Aryan thought. Persia must have been even at this time in close co ntact with India, for about the date of the death of Pythagora s, in the reign of Dareius, son of Hystaspes, at the end of the six th and beginning of the fifth century before our era, we h ear of the expedition of the Persian general Scylax down the I ndus, and learn from Herodotus that in this reign India (that is the Punjab) formed the twentieth satrapy of the Persian monarch y. Moreover, Indian troops were among the hosts of Xer xes; they invaded Thessaly and fought at Platæa. From the time of Alexander onwards there was direct and constant contact between Ā ry ā varta and the kingdoms of the successors of the p. 20 world-conqueror, and many Greeks wrote about this l and of mystery; but in all that has come down to us we loo k in vain for anything but the vaguest indications of what the \"p hilosophers\" of India systematically thought. That the Brahmans would at this time have permitted their sacred books to be read by the Yavanas (Ionians, th e general name for Greeks in Indian records) is contrary to a ll we know of their history. The Yavanas were Mlechchhas, outside the pale of the Ā ryas, and all they could glean of the jealously gua rded Brahma-vidy ā or theosophy must have depended solely upon outside observation. But the dominant religious act ivity at this time in India was Buddhist, and it is to this prote st against the rigid distinctions of caste and race made by Br ā hmanical pride, and to the startling novelty of an enthusiastic rel igious propaganda among all classes and races in India, an d outside India to all nations, that we must look for the mos t direct contact of thought between India and Greece."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 For instance, in the middle of the third century B . C ., we know from Asoka's thirteenth edict, that this Buddhist E mperor of India, the Constantine of the East, sent missionari es to Antiochus II. of Syria, Ptolemy II. of Egypt, Antig onus Gonatas of Macedonia, Magas of Cyrene, and Alexander II. of Epirus. When, in a land of such imperfect p. 21 records, the evidence on the side of India is so cl ear and indubitable, all the more extraordinary is it that we have no direct testimony on our side of so great a missiona ry activity. Although, then, merely because of the absence of al l direct information from Greek sources, it is very unsafe t o generalize, nevertheless from our general knowledge of the time s it is not illegitimate to conclude that no great public stir could have been made by these pioneers of the Dharma in the West. I n every probability these Buddhist Bhikshus produced no eff ect on the rulers or on the people. But was their mission enti rely abortive; and did Buddhist missionary enterprise westwards ce ase with them? The answer to this question, as it seems to us, is hidden in the obscurity of the religious communities. We cannot, however, go so far as to agree with those who would cut the gor dian knot by asserting dogmatically that the ascetic communities in Syria and Egypt were founded by these Buddhist propagandists. Already even in Greece itself were not only Pythagorean but even prior to them Orphic communities, for even on this ground we believe that Pythagoras rather developed what he found alre ady existing, than that he established something entire ly new. And if they were found in Greece, much more then is it rea sonable to suppose that such communities p. 22 already existed in Syria, Arabia, and Egypt, whose populations were given far more to religious exercises than the sceptical and laughter-loving G reeks."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 It is, however, credible that in such communities, if anywhere, Buddhist propaganda would find an appreciative and attentive audience; but even so it is remarkable that they ha ve left no distinctly direct trace of their influence. Neverth eless, both by the sea way and by the great caravan route there wa s an ever open line of communication between India and the Em pire of the successors of Alexander; and it is even permiss ible to speculate, that if we could recover a catalogue of the great Alexandrian library, for instance, we should percha nce find that in it Indian MSS. were to be found among the other rolls and parchments of the scriptures of the nations. Indeed, there are phrases in the oldest treatises o f the Trismegistic Hermetic literature which can be so cl osely paralleled with phrases in the Upanis\t hads and in the Bhagavad G ī t ā , that one is almost tempted to believe that the wr iters had some acquaintance with the general contents of thes e Br ā hmanical scriptures. The Trismegistic literature ha d its genesis in Egypt, and its earliest deposit must be dated at least in the first century A . D ., if it cannot even be pushed back earlier. Even more striking is the similarity between the p. 23 lofty mystic metaphysic of the Gnostic doctor Basil ides, who lived at the end of the first and beginning of the second century A . D ., and Ved ā ntic ideas. Moreover, both the Hermetic and the Basilidean schools and their immediate predecessors were devoted to a stern self-discipline and deep philoso phical study which would make them welcome eagerly any philosoph er or mystic student who might come from the far East. But even so, we are not of those who by their own s elf-imposed limitations of possibility are condemned to find so me direct physical contact to account for a similarity of ide as or even of phrasing. Granting, for instance, that there is muc h resemblance between the teachings of the Dharma of the Buddha a nd of the Gospel of the Christ, and that the same spirit of l ove and"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 gentleness pervades them both, still there is no ne cessity to look for the reason of this resemblance to purely physic al transmission. And so for other schools and other te achers; like conditions will produce similar phenomena; like eff ort and like aspiration will produce similar ideas, similar expe rience, and similar response. And this we believe to be the cas e in no general way, but that it is all very definitely ord ered from within by the servants of the real guardians of things rel igious in this world. We are, then, not compelled to lay so much p. 24 stress on the question of physical transmission, or to be seeking even to find proof of copying. The human mind in it s various degrees is much the same in all climes and ages, an d its inner experience has a common ground into which seed may be sown, as it is tilled and cleared of weeds. The good seed comes all from the same granary, and those who sow it pay no attention to the man-made outer distinctions of race and creed. However difficult, therefore, it may be to prove, f rom unquestionably historical statements, any direct in fluence of Indian thought on the conceptions and practices of some of these religious communities and philosophic schools of th e Græco- Roman Empire, and although in any particular case s imilarity of ideas need not necessarily be assigned to direct ph ysical transmission, nevertheless the highest probability, if not the greatest assurance, remains that even prior to the days of Apollonius there was some private knowledge in Gree ce of the general ideas of the Vedanta and Dharma; while in t he case of Apollonius himself, even if we discount nine-tenths of what is related of him, his one idea seems to have been to spread abroad among the religious brotherhoods and institutions o f the Empire some portion of the wisdom which he brought back wi th him from India. When, then, we find at the end of the first"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 p. 25 and during the first half of the second century, am ong such mystic associations as the Hermetic and Gnostic sch ools, ideas which strongly remind us of the theosophy of the Upanis\t hads or the reasoned ethics of the Suttas, we have always t o take into consideration not only the high probability of Apol lonius having visited such schools, but also the possibility of h is having discoursed at length therein on the Indian wisdom. Not only so, but the memory of his influence may have lingered f or long in such circles, for do we not find Plotinus, the cory phæus of Neo- Platonism, as it is called, so enamoured with what he had heard of the wisdom of India at Alexandria, that in 242 h e started off with the ill-starred expedition of Gordian to the E ast in the hope of reaching that land of philosophy? With the failu re of the expedition and assassination of the Emperor, howeve r, he had to return, for ever disappointed of his hope. It is not, however, to be thought that Apollonius s et out to make a propaganda of Indian philosophy in the same way t hat the ordinary missionary sets forth to preach his concep tion of the Gospel. By no means; Apollonius seems to have endea voured to help his hearers, whoever they might be, in the way best suited to each of them. He did not begin p. 26 by telling them that what they believed was utterly false and soul-destroying, and that their eternal welfare dep ended upon their instantly adopting his own special scheme of salvation; he simply endeavoured to purge and further explain wha t they already believed and practised. That some strong po wer supported him in his ceaseless activity, and in his almost world- wide task, is not so difficult of belief; and it is a question of deep interest for those who strive to peer through the mists of appearance, to speculate how that not only a Paul b ut also an Apollonius was aided and directed in his task from within."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 The day, however, has not yet dawned when it will b e possible for the general mind in the West to approach the qu estion with such freedom from prejudice, as to bear the thought that, seen from within, not only Paul but also Apollonius may well have been a \"disciple of the Lord\" in the true sense of the words; and that too although on the surface of things their ta sks seem in many ways so dissimilar, and even, to theological preconceptions, entirely antagonistic. Fortunately, however, even to-day there is an ever- growing number of thinking people who will not only not be shocked by such a belief, but who will receive it with joy as the herald of the p. 27 dawning of a true sun of righteousness, which will do more to illumine the manifold ways of the religion of our c ommon humanity than all the self-righteousness of any par ticular body of exclusive religionists. It is, then, in this atmosphere of charity and tole rance that we would ask the reader to approach the consideration of Apollonius and his doings, and not only the life an d deeds of an Apollonius, but also of all those who have striven to help their fellows the world over. THE APOLLONIUS OF EARLY OPINION A POLLONIUS of Tyana * was the most famous philosopher of the Græco-Roman world of the first century, and dev oted the major part of his long life to the purification of the many cults of the Empire and to the instruction of the ministers and priests of its religions. With the exception of the Christ no more interesting personage appears upon the stage of Wes tern history in these early years. Many and various and oft-time s mutually contradictory are the opinions which have been held about Apollonius, for the account of his life which has c ome down to us is in the guise of a romantic story rather than in the form of a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 plain history. And this is perhaps to some extent t o be expected, for Apollonius, besides his public teaching, had a life apart, a life into which even his favourite disciple does p. 29 not enter. He journeys into the most distant lands, and is lost to the world for years; he enters the shrines of the m ost sacred temples and the inner circles of the most exclusive communities, and what he says or does therein remains a mystery, or serves only as an opportunity for the weaving of some fant astic story by those who did not understand. The following study will be simply an attempt to pu t before the reader a brief sketch of the problem which the reco rds and traditions of the life of the famous Tyanean presen t; but before we deal with the Life of Apollonius, written by Fla vius Philostratus at the beginning of the third century, we must give the reader a brief account of the references to Apo llonius among the classical writers and the Church Fathers, and. a short sketch of the literature of the subject in more recent tim es, and of the varying fortunes of the war of opinion concerning h is life in the last four centuries. First, then, with regard to the references in class ical and patristic authors. Lucian, the witty writer of the first half of the second century, makes the subject of one of his satires th e pupil of a disciple of Apollonius, of one of those who were ac quainted with \"all the tragedy\" * of his life. And Appuleius, a contemporary of Lucian, classes p. 30 [paragraph continues] Apollonius with Moses and Zor oaster, and other famous Magi of antiquity. * About the same period, in a work entitled Quæstione s et Responsiones ad Orthodoxos, formerly attributed to Justin"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 Martyr, who flourished in the second quarter of the second century, we find the following interesting statemen t: \"Question 24: If God is the maker and master of cre ation, how do the consecrated objects † of Apollonius have power in the [various] orders of that creation? For, as we see , they check the fury of the waves and the power of the winds and th e inroads of vermin and attacks of wild beasts.\" ‡ Dion Cassius in his history, § which he wrote A . D . 211-222, states that Caracalla (Emp. 211-216) honoured the m emory of Apollonius with a chapel or monument ( heroum ). It was just at this time (216) that Philostratus co mposed his Life of Apollonius, at the request of Domna Julia, Carac alla's mother, and it is with this document principally that we sh all have to deal in the sequel. p. 31 Lampridius, who flourished about the middle of the third century, further informs us that Alexander Severus (Emp. 222- 235) placed the statue of Apollonius in his lararium together with those of Christ, Abraham, and Orpheus. * Vopiscus, writing in the last decade of the third c entury, tells us that Aurelian (Emp. 270-275) vowed a temple to Apol lonius, of whom he had seen a vision when besieging Tyana. Vop iscus speaks of the Tyanean as \"a sage of the most wide-s pread renown and authority, an ancient philosopher, and a true friend of the Gods,\" nay, as a manifestation of deity. \"Fo r what among men,\" exclaims the historian, \"was more holy, what more worthy of reverence, what more venerable, what more god-like than he? He, it was, who gave life to the dead. He, it was, who did and said so many things beyond the power of men .\" † So enthusiastic is Vopiscus about Apollonius, that he promises, if he lives, to write a short account of his life in L atin, so that his deeds and words may be on the tongue of all, for as yet the only"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 accounts are in Greek. ‡ Vopiscus, however, did not fulfil his promise, but p. 32 we learn that about this date both Soterichus * and Nichomachus wrote Lives of our philosopher, and shortly afterwa rds Tascius Victorianus, working on the papers of Nichomachus, † also composed a Life. None of these Lives, however, have reached us. It was just at this period also, namely, in the las t years of the third century and the first years of the fourth, th at Porphyry and Iamblichus composed their treatises on Pythagoras a nd his school; both mention Apollonius as one of their aut horities, and it is probable that the first 30 sections of Iambli chus are taken from Apollonius. ‡ We now come to an incident which hurled the charact er of Apollonius into the arena of Christian polemics, wh ere it has been tossed about until the present day. Hierocles, successively governor of Palmyra, Bithynia, and Alexandria, and a philosopher, about the year 305 wrote a criticism o n the claims of the Christians, in two books, p. 33 called A Truthful Address to the Christians, or mor e shortly The Truth-lover. He seems to have based himself for the most part on the previous works of Celsus and Porphyry, * but introduced a new subject of controversy by opposing the wonder ful works of Apollonius to the claims of the Christians to ex clusive right in \"miracles\" as proof of the divinity of their Mas ter. In this part of his treatise Hierocles used Philostratus’ Life o f Apollonius. To this pertinent criticism of Hierocles Eusebius o f Cæsarea immediately replied in a treatise still extant, ent itled Contra Hieroclem. † Eusebius admits that Apollonius was a wise and virtuous man, but denies that there is sufficient p roof that the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 wonderful things ascribed to him ever took place; a nd even if they did take place, they were the work of \"dæmons, \" and not of God. The treatise of Eusebius is interesting; he se verely scrutinises the statements in Philostratus, and sho ws himself possessed of a first rate critical p. 34 faculty. Had he only used the same faculty on the d ocuments of the Church, of which he was the first historian, po sterity would have owed him an eternal debt of gratitude. But Eus ebius, like so many other apologists, could only see one side; justice, when anything touching Christianity was called into ques tion, was a stranger to his mind, and he would have considered it blasphemy to use his critical faculty on the docume nts which relate the \"miracles\" of Jesus. Still the problem o f \"miracle\" was the same, as Hierocles pointed out, and remains the same to this day. After the controversy reincarnated again in the six teenth century, and when the hypothesis of the \"Devil\" as the prime- mover in all \"miracles\" but those of the Church los t its hold with the progress of scientific thought, the nature of t he wonders related in the Life of Apollonius was still so grea t a difficulty that it gave rise to a new hypothesis of plagiarism . The life of Apollonius was a Pagan plagiarism of the life of Je sus. But Eusebius and the Fathers who followed him had no su spicion of this; they lived in times when such an assertion co uld have been easily refuted. There is not a word in Philostratus to show he had any acquaintance with the life of Jesus, and fa scinating as Baur's \"tendency-writing\" theory is to many, we can only say that p. 35 as a plagiarist of the Gospel story Philostratus is a conspicuous failure. Philostratus writes the history of a good and wise man, a man with a mission of teaching, clothed in the wond er stories preserved in the memory and embellished by the imag ination of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 fond posterity, but not the drama of incarnate Deit y as the fulfilment of world-prophecy. Lactantius, writing about 315, also attacked the tr eatise of Hierocles, who seems to have put forward some very pertinent criticisms; for the Church Father says that he enum erates so many of their Christian inner teachings ( intima ) that sometimes he would seem to have at one time undergone the sam e training ( disciplina ). But it is in vain, says Lactantius, that Hierocl es endeavours to show that Apollonius performed simila r or even greater deeds than Jesus, for Christians do not bel ieve that Christ is God because he did wonderful things, but because all the things wrought in him were those which were ann ounced by the prophets. * And in taking this ground Lactantius saw far more clearly than Eusebius the weakness of the proo f from \"miracle.\" Arnobius, the teacher of Lactantius, however, writi ng at the end of the third century, before p. 36 the controversy, in referring to Apollonius simply classes him among Magi, such as Zoroaster and others mentioned in the passage of Appuleius to which we have already refer red. * But even after the controversy there is a wide diff erence of opinion among the Fathers, for although at the end of the fourth century John Chrysostom with great bitterness calls Apollonius a deceiver and evil-doer, and declares that the who le of the incidents in his life are unqualified fiction, † Jerome, on the contrary, at the very same date, takes almost a fav ourable view, for, after perusing Philostratus, he writes that Ap ollonius found everywhere something to learn and something whereby he might become a better man. ‡ At the beginning of the fifth century also Augustin e, while ridiculing any attempt at comparison between Apollo nius and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 Jesus, says that the character of the Tyanean was \" far superior\" to that ascribed to Jove, in respect of virtue. § p. 37 About the same date also we find Isidorus of Pelusi um, who died in 450, bluntly denying that there is any trut h in the claim made by \"certain,\" whom he does not further specify , that Apollonius of Tyana \"consecrated many spots in many parts of the world for the safety of the inhabitants.\" * It is instructive to compare the denial of Isidorus with the passage we have already quoted from Pseudo-Justin. The writer of Questions and Answers to the Orthodox in the second century could not dispose of the question by a blunt denial; he had t o admit it and argue the case on other grounds—namely, the agency of the Devil. Nor can the argument of the Fathers, that Ap ollonius used magic to bring about his results, while the untaugh t Christians could perform healing wonders by a single word, † be accepted as valid by the unprejudiced critic, for there is n o evidence to support the contention that Apollonius employed suc h methods for his wonder-workings; on the contrary, both Apol lonius himself and his biographer Philostratus strenuously repudiate the charge of magic brought against him. On the other hand, a few years later, Sidonius Apol linaris, Bishop of Claremont, speaks in the p. 38 highest terms of Apollonius. Sidonius translated th e Life of Apollonius into Latin for Leon, the councillor of K ing Euric, and in writing to his friend he says: \"Read the lif e of a man who (religion apart) resembles you in many things; a ma n sought out by the rich, yet who never sought for riches; who l oved wisdom and despised gold; a man frugal in the midst of fea stings, clad in linen in the midst of those clothed in purple, aust ere in the midst of luxury. . . . In fine, to speak plainly, perchan ce no historian will find in ancient times a philosopher whose life is equal to that of Apollonius.\" * "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 Thus we see that even among the Church Fathers opin ions were divided; while among the philosophers themselves th e praise of Apollonius was unstinted. For Ammianus Marcellinus, \"the last subject of Rome who composed a profane history in the Latin language,\" and the friend of Julian the philosopher-emperor, refers to the Tyanean as \"that most renowned philosopher\"; † while a few years later Eunapius, the pupil of Chrysanthius, one of the tea chers of Julian, writing in the last years of the fourth cen tury, says that p. 39 [paragraph continues] Apollonius was more than a ph ilosopher; he was \"a middle term, as it were, between gods and men.\" * Not only was Apollonius an adherent of the Pythagor ean philosophy, but \"he fully exemplified the more divi ne and practical side in it.\" In fact Philostratus should have called his biography \"The Sojourning of a God among Men.\" † This seemingly wildly exaggerated estimate may perhaps r eceive explanation in the fact that Eunapius belonged to a school which knew the nature of the attainments ascribed to Apol lonius. Indeed, \"as late as the fifth century we find one V olusian, a proconsul of Africa, descended from an old Roman fa mily and still strongly attached to the religion of his ance stors, almost worshipping Apollonius of Tyana as a supernatural b eing.\" ‡ p. 40 Even after the downfall of philosophy we find Cassi odorus, who spent the last years of his long life in a monaster y, speaking of Apollonius as the \"renowned philosopher.\" * So also among Byzantine writers, the monk George Syncellus, in th e eighth century, refers several times to our philosopher, a nd not only without the slightest adverse criticism, but he dec lares that he was the first and most remarkable of all the illust rious people who appeared under the Empire. † Tzetzes also, the critic and"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 grammarian, calls Apollonius \"all-wise and a fore-k nower of all things.\" ‡ And though the monk Xiphilinus, in the eleventh cen tury, in a note to his abridgment of the history of Dion Cassi us, calls Apollonius a clever juggler and magician, § nevertheless Cedrenus in the same century bestows on Apollonius the not uncomplimentary title of an \"adept Pythagorean philosopher,\" ** and relates several instances of the efficacy of his powers p. 41 in Byzantium. In fact, if we can believe Nicetas, a s late as the thirteenth century there were at Byzantium certain bronze doors, formerly consecrated by Apollonius, which had to be melted down because they had become an object of superstit ion even for the Christians themselves. * Had the work of Philostratus disappeared with the r est of the Lives, the above would be all that we should have k nown about Apollonius. † Little enough, it is true, concerning so distinguished a character, yet ample enough to show that, with the exception of theological prejudice, the suffrag es of antiquity were all on the side of our philosopher.

Apollonius ret urned to the memory of the world, after the oblivion of the dark ages, with evil auspices. From the very beginning the old Hier ocles- Eusebius controversy was revived, and the whole sub ject was at once taken out of the calm region of philosophy and history and hurled once more into the stormy arena of religious bitterness and prejudice. For long Aldus hesitated to print th e text of Philostratus, and only finally did so (in 1501) wit h the text of Eusebius as an appendix, so that, as he piously phr ases it, \"the antidote might accompany the poison.\" Together with it appeared a Latin translation by the Florentine Rinu cci. * p. 43"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 In addition to the Latin version the sixteenth cent ury also produced an Italian * and French translation. † The editio princeps of Aldus was superseded a century later by the edition of Morel ‡ , which in its turn was followed a century still later by that of Olearius. § Nearly a century and a half later again the text of Olearius was superseded by that o f Kayser (the first critical text), whose work in its last editio n contains the latest critical apparatus. ** All information with regard to the MSS. will be found in Kayser's Latin Prefaces. p. 44 We shall now attempt to give some idea of the gener al literature on the subject, so that the reader may be able to n ote some of the varying fortunes of the war of opinion in the bibli ographical indications. And if the general reader should be im patient of the matter and eager to get to something of greater int erest, he can easily omit its perusal; while if he be a lover of the mystic way, and does not take delight in wrangling controversy, he may at least sympathise with the writer, who has been comp elled to look through the works of the last century and a go od round dozen of those of the previous centuries, before he could venture on an opinion of his own with a clear conscience. Sectarian prejudice against Apollonius characterise s nearly every opinion prior to the nineteenth century. * Of books distinctly dedicated to the subject the works of th e Abbé Dupin † and of de Tillemont ‡ are bitter attacks p. 45 on the Philosopher of Tyana in defence of the monop oly of Christian miracles; while those of the Abbé Houttev ille * and Lüderwald † are less violent, though on the same lines. A pseudonymous writer, however, of the eighteenth cen tury strikes out a somewhat different line by classing together the miracles of the Jesuits and other Monastic Orders with those of"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 Apollonius, and dubbing them all spurious, while ma intaining the sole authenticity of those of Jesus. ‡ Nevertheless, Bacon and Voltaire speak of Apolloniu s in the highest terms, § and even a century before the latter the English Deist, Charles Blount, ** raised his voice against the p. 46 universal obloquy poured upon the character of the Tyanean; his work, however, was speedily suppressed. In the midst of this war about miracles in the eigh teenth century it is pleasant to remark the short treatise of Herz og, who endeavours to give a sketch of the philosophy and r eligious life of Apollonius, * but, alas! there were no followers of so liberal an example in this century of strife. So far then for the earlier literature of the subje ct. Frankly none of it is worth reading; the problem could not be ca lmly considered in such a period. It started on the fals e ground of the Hierocles-Eusebius controversy, which was but an in cident (for wonder-working is common to all great teachers and not peculiar to Apollonius or Jesus), and was embittere d by the rise of Encyclopædism and the rationalism of the Revolut ion period. Not that the miracle-controversy ceased even in the last century; it p. 47 does not, however, any longer obscure the whole hor izon, and the sun of a calmer judgment may be seen breaking t hrough the mist. In order to make the rest of our summary clearer we append at the end of this essay the titles of the works which have appeared since the beginning of the nineteenth century, in c hronological order."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 A glance over this list will show that the last cen tury has produced an English (Berwick's), an Italian (Lancet ti's), a French (Chassang's), and two German translations (J acobs’ and Baltzer's). * The Rev. E. Berwick's translation is the only English version; in his Preface the author, while a sserting the falsity of the miraculous element in the Life, says that the rest of the work deserves careful attention. No harm will a ccrue to the Christian religion by its perusal, for there are no allusions to the Life of Christ in it, and the miracles are based on those ascribed to Pythagoras. This is certainly a healthier standpoint than that of the traditional theological controversy, which, unfortunately, howe ver, was revived p. 48 again by the great authority of Baur, who saw in a number of the early documents of the Christian era (notably the c anonical Acts) tendency-writings of but slight historical co ntent, representing the changing fortunes of schools and p arties and not the actual histories of individuals. The Life o f Apollonius was one of these tendency-writings; its object was to put forward a view opposed to Christianity in favour of philosophy. Baur thus divorced the whole subject from its histo rical standpoint and attributed to Philostratus an elabor ate scheme of which he was entirely innocent. Baur's view was lar gely adopted by Zeller in his Philosophie der Griechen (v. 140), and by Réville in Holland. This \"Christusbild\" theory (carried by a few extrem ists to the point of denying that Apollonius ever existed) has had a great vogue among writers on the subject, especially comp ilers of encyclopædia articles; it is at any rate a wider is sue than the traditional miracle-wrangle, which. was again reviv ed in all its ancient narrowness by Newman, who only uses Apollon ius as an excuse for a dissertation on orthodox miracles, to which he devotes eighteen pages out of the twenty-five of hi s treatise."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 Noack also follows Baur, and to some extent Petters ch, though he takes the subject onto the ground of philosophy; while Möckeberg, pastor of St. Nicolai in Hamburg, p. 49 though striving to be fair to Apollonius, ends his chatty dissertation with an outburst of orthodox praises o f Jesus, praises which we by no means grudge, but which are entirely out of place in such a subject. The development of the Jesus-Apollonius miracle-con troversy into the Jesus-against-Apollonius and even Christ-a gainst-Anti- Christ battle, fought out with relays of lusty cham pions on the one side against a feeble protest at best on the ot her, is a painful spectacle to contemplate. How sadly must Jesus and Apollonius have looked upon, and still look upon, this bitter and useless strife over their saintly persons. Why should poste rity set their memories one against the other? Did they oppose one another in life? Did even their biographers do so after their deaths? Why then could not the controversy have ceased with Eus ebius? For Lactantius frankly admits the point brought forward by Hierocles (to exemplify which Hierocles only referr ed to Apollonius as one instance out of many)—that \"mirac les\" do not prove divinity. We rest our claims, says Lactantius , not on miracles, but on the fulfilment of prophecy. * Had this more sensible position been revived p. 50 instead of that of Eusebius, the problem of Apollon ius would have been considered in its natural historical envi ronment four hundred years ago, and much ink and paper would hav e been saved. With the progress of the critical method, however, opinion has at length partly recovered its balance, and it is p leasant to be able to turn to works which have rescued the subjec t from theological obscurantism and placed it in the open field of"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 historical and critical research. The two volumes o f the independent thinker, Legrand d’Aussy, which appeare d at the very beginning of the last century, are, for the ti me, remarkably free from prejudice, and are a praiseworthy attempt at historical impartiality, but criticism was still young at this period. Kayser, though he does not go thoroughly into the matter, d ecides that the account of Philostratus is purely a \" fabularis narratio ,\" but is well opposed by I. Müller, who contends for a st rong element of history as a background. But by far the best sif ting of the sources is that of Jensen. * Priaulx’s study deals solely with the Indian episode and is of no critical value for the estimation of the sources. Of all previous studies, however, the works of Chassang and p. 51 [paragraph continues] Baltzer are the most generall y intelligent, for both writers are aware of the possibilities of psychic science, though mostly from the insufficient standpoint of s piritistic phenomena. As for Tredwell's somewhat pretentious volume which , being in English, is accessible to the general reader, it is largely reactionary, and is used as a cover for adverse cri ticism of the Christian origins from a Secularist standpoint whic h denies at the outset the possibility of \"miracle\" in any mean ing of the word. A mass of well-known numismatological and oth er matter, which is entirely irrelevant, but which see ms to be new and surprising to the author, is introduced, and a map is prefixed to the title-page purporting to give the itinerarie s of Apollonius, but having little reference to the text of Philostr atus.

"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 THE BIOGRAPHER OF APOLLONIUS F LAVIUS P HILOSTRATUS , the writer of the only Life of Apollonius which has come down to us, * was a distinguished man of letters who lived in the last quarter of the second and the first half of the third century (cir. 175-245 A . D .). He formed one of the circle of famous writers and thinkers gather ed round the philosopher-empress, † Julia Domna, who was the guiding spirit of the Empire during the reigns of her husband Sept imius Severus and her son Caracalla. All three members of the imperial family were students of occult science, an d the age was preeminently one in which the occult arts, good and bad, were a passion. Thus the sceptical Gibbon, in his sketch o f Severus and his famous consort, writes: \"Like most of the Africans, Severus was p. 54 passionately addicted to the vain studies of magic and divination, deeply versed in the interpretation of dreams and omens, and perfectly acquainted with the science of judicial astrology, which in almost every age except the pre sent, has maintained its dominion over the mind of man. He ha d lost his first wife whilst he was governor of the Lionnese G aul. In the choice of a second, he sought only to connect himse lf with some favourite of fortune; and as soon as he had discove red that a young lady of Emesa in Syria had a royal nativity , * he solicited and obtained her hand. Julia Domna † (for that was her name) deserved all that the stars could promise her. She possessed, even in an advanced age, ‡ the attractions of beauty, and united to a lively imagination a firmness of mind, and str ength of judgment, seldom bestowed on her sex. Her amiable q ualities never made any deep impression on the dark and jeal ous temper of her husband, § but in her son's reign, she administered the principal affairs of the Empire with a prudence tha t supported his authority, and with a moderation that sometimes corrected"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 p. 55 his wild extravagances. Julia applied herself to le tters and philosophy with some success, and with the most spl endid reputation. She was the patroness of every art, and the friend of every man of genius.\" * We thus see, even from Gibbon's somewhat grudging e stimate, that Domna Julia was a woman of remarkable characte r, whose outer acts give evidence of an inner purpose, and w hose private life has not been written. It was at her request th at Philostratus wrote the Life of Apollonius, and it was she who su pplied him with certain MSS. that were in her possession, as a basis; for the beautiful daughter of Bassianus, priest of the sun at Emesa, was an ardent collector of books from every part of the world, especially of the MSS. of philosophers and of memor anda and biographical notes relating to the famous students of the inner nature of things. That Philostratus was the best man to whom to entru st so important a task, is doubtful. It is true that he w as a skilled stylist and a practised man of letters, an art crit ic and an ardent antiquarian, as we may see from his other works; bu t he was a sophist rather than a philosopher, and though an en thusiastic admirer of Pythagoras and his school, was so from a p. 56 distance, regarding it rather through a wonder-lovi ng atmosphere of curiosity and the embellishments of a lively imagination than from a personal acquaintance with its discipline, or a practical knowledge of those hidde n forces of the soul with which its adepts dealt. We have, therefor e, to expect a sketch of the appearance of a thing by one outside, rather than an exposition of the thing itself from one within. The following is Philostratus’ account of the sourc es from which he derived his information concerning Apollon ius: * "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 \"I have collected my materials partly from the citi es which loved him, partly from the temples whose rites and regula tions he restored from their former state of neglect, partly from what others have said about him, and partly from his own letters. † More detailed information I procured as follows. Da mis was a man of some education who formerly used to p. 57 live in the ancient city of Ninus. * He became a disciple of Apollonius and recorded his travels, in which he sa ys he himself took part, and also the views, sayings, and predict ions of his master. A member of Damis’ family brought the Empre ss Julia the note-books † containing these memoirs, which up to that time had not been known of. As I was one of the cir cle of this princess, who was a lover and patroness of all lite rary productions, she ordered me to rewrite these sketch es and improve their form of expression, for though the Ni nevite expressed himself clearly, his style was far from c orrect. I also have had access to a book by Maximus ‡ of Ægæ which contained all Apollonius’ doings at Ægæ. § There is also a will written by Apollonius, from which we can learn how he almost deified philosophy. ** As to the four books of Mœragenes ¶ on Apollonius they do not deserve p. 58 attention, for he knows nothing of most of the fact s of his life\" (i. 2, 3). These are the sources to which Philostratus was ind ebted for his information, sources which are unfortunately no lon ger accessible to us, except perhaps a few letters. Nor did Philostratus spare any pains to gather information on the subject, for in his concluding words (viii. 31), he tells us that he has himself travelled into most parts of the \"world\" an d everywhere met with the \"inspired sayings\" * of Apollonius, and that he was especially well acquainted with the temple dedicate d to the memory of our philosopher at Tyana and founded at t he imperial"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 expense (\"for the emperors had judged him not unwor thy of like honours with themselves\"), whose priests, it is to be presumed, had got together as much information as they could concerning Apollonius. A thoroughly critical analysis of the literary effo rt of Philostratus, therefore, would have to take into ac count all of these factors, and endeavour to assign each stateme nt to its original source. But even then the task of the hist orian would be incomplete, for it is transparently evident that Ph ilostratus has considerably . p. 59 [paragraph continues] \"embellished\" the narrative w ith numerous notes and additions of his own and with th e composition of set speeches. Now as the ancient writers did not separate their n otes from the text, or indicate them in any distinct fashion, we have to be constantly on our guard to detect the original sour ces from the glosses of the writer. * In fact Philostratus is ever taking advantage of the mention of a name or a subject to display his own knowledge, which is often of a most legendary a nd fantastic nature. This is especially the ease in hi s description of Apollonius’ Indian travels. India at that time and long afterwards was considered the \"end of the world,\" a nd an infinity of the strangest \"travellers’ tales\" and m ythological fables were in circulation concerning it. One has o nly to read the accounts of the writers on India † from the time of Alexander onwards to discover the source of most of the stran ge incidents p. 60 that Philostratus records as experiences of Apollon ius. To take but one instance out of a hundred, Apollonius had t o cross the Caucasus, an indefinite name for the great system o f mountain"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 ranges that bound the northern limits of Ā ry ā varta. Prometheus was chained to the Caucasus, so every child had bee n told for centuries. Therefore, if Apollonius crossed the Cau casus, he must have seen those chains. And so it was, Philost ratus assures us (ii. 3). Not only so, but he volunteers the addi tional information that you could not tell of what they we re made! A perusal of Megasthenes, however, will speedily redu ce the long Philostratian account of the Indian travels of Apol lonius (i. 41– iii. 58) to a very narrow compass, for page after p age is simply padding, picked up from any one of the numerous Ind ica to which our widely read author had access. * To judge from such writers, Porus † (the R ā j ā h conquered by Alexander) was the immemorial king of India. In fact, in speaking of I ndia or any other little-known country, a writer in these days had to drag in all that popular legend associated with it or he st ood little chance of being listened to. He had p. 61 to give his narrative a \"local colour,\" and this wa s especially the case in a technical rhetorical effort like that of Philostratus. Again, it was the fashion to insert set speeches an d put them in the mouths of well-known characters on historical o ccasions, good instances of which may be seen in Thucydides a nd the Acts of the Apostles. Philostratus repeatedly does this. But it would be too long to enter into a detailed i nvestigation of the subject, although the writer has prepared notes on all these points, for that would be to write a volume and not a sketch. Only a few points are therefore set down, to warn t he student to be ever on his guard to sift out Philostratus from his sources. * But though we must be keenly alive to the importanc e of a thoroughly critical attitude where definite facts o f history are concerned, we should be as keenly on our guard agai nst judging everything from the standpoint of modern preconcept ions. There is but one religious literature of antiquity that h as ever been"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 treated with real sympathy in the West, and that is the Judo- Christian; in that alone have men been p. 62 trained to feel at home, and all in antiquity that treats of religion in a different mode to the Jewish or Christian way, is felt to be strange, and, if obscure or extraordinary, to be ev en repulsive. The sayings and doings of the Jewish prophets, of J esus, and of the Apostles, are related with reverence, embellish ed with the greatest beauties of diction, and illumined with th e best thought of the age; while the sayings and doings of other p rophets and teachers have been for the most part subjected to t he most unsympathetic criticism, in which no attempt is mad e to understand their standpoint. Had even-handed justic e been dealt out all round, the world to-day would have been ric her in sympathy, in wide-mindedness, in comprehension of n ature, humanity, and God, in brief, in soul-experience. Therefore, in reading the Life of Apollonius let us remember that we have to look at it through the eyes of a Gr eek, and not through those of a Jew or a Protestant. The Many in their proper sphere must be for us as authentic a manifestation of the Divine as the One or the All, for indeed the \"Gods\" exist in spite of commandment and creed. The Saints and Martyrs and A ngels have seemingly taken the places of the Heroes and D aemons and Gods, but the change of name and change of view-poi nt among men affect but little the unchangeable facts. To se nse p. 63 the facts of universal religion under the ever-chan ging names which men bestow upon them, and then to enter with full sympathy and comprehension into the hopes and fears of every phase of the religious mind—to read, as it were, th e past lives of our own souls—is a most difficult task. But until w e can put ourselves understandingly in the places of others, we can never see more than one side of the Infinite Life of God.

To Apollonius the mere fashion of a man's faith was unessential; he was at home in all lands, among all cults. He ha d a helpful word for all, p. 64 an intimate knowledge of the particular way of each of them, which enabled him to restore them to health. Such m en are rare; the records of such men are precious, and require t he embellishments of no rhetorician.

But mere rhetoric and style and the life of the \"schools\" were little suited to his serious disposition, and he speedily left for Ægæ, a town on the sea-coast east of Tarsus. Here he found surrounding s more suitable to his needs, and plunged with ardour into the study of philosophy. He became intimate with the priests of the temple of Æsculapius, where cures were still wrought, and p. 66 enjoyed the society and instruction of pupils and t eachers of the Platonic, Stoic, Peripatetic, and Epicurean schools of philosophy; but though he studied all these systems of thought with attention, it was the lessons of the Pythagore an school upon which he seized with an extraordinary depth of comprehension, * and that, too, although his teacher, Euxenus, was but a parrot of the doctrines and not a practis er of the discipline. But such parrotting was not enough for the eager spirit of Apollonius; his extraordinary \"memory,\" w hich infused life into the dull utterances of his tutor, urged h im on, and at the age of sixteen \"he soared into the Pythagorean life , winged by some greater one.\" † Nevertheless he retained his affection for the man who had told him of the way, and rewarded h im handsomely (i. 7). When Euxenus asked him how he would begin his new m ode of life he replied: \"As doctors purge their patients.\" Hence he refused to touch anything that had animal life in i t, on the ground that it densified the mind and rendered it i mpure. He considered that the only pure form of food was what the earth produced, fruits and vegetables. He also abstained from wine, for though it was made from fruit, \"it rendered tur bid the p. 67 æther * in the soul\" and \"destroyed the composure of the m ind.\" Moreover, he went barefoot, let his hair grow long, and wore nothing but linen. He now lived in the temple, to t he admiration of the priests and with the express approval of Æsc ulapius, † "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 and he rapidly became so famous for his asceticism and pious life, that a saying ‡ of the Cilicians about him became a proverb (i. 8). At the age of twenty his father died (his mother ha ving died some years before) leaving a considerable fortune, which Apollonius was to share with his elder brother, a w ild and dissolute youth of twenty-three. Being still a mino r, Apollonius continued to reside at Ægæ, where the temple of Æsc ulapius had now become a busy centre of study, and echoed from one end to the other with the sound of lofty philosophical dis courses. On coming of age he returned to Tyana to endeavour to rescue his brother from his vicious life. His brother had appa rently exhausted his legal share of the property, and Apol lonius at once made over half of his own p. 68 portion to him, and by his gentle admonitions resto red him to his manhood. In fact he seems to have devoted his time to setting in order the affairs of the family, for he distributed the rest of his patrimony among certain of his relatives, and kept for himself but a bare pittance; he required but little, he sai d, and should never marry (i. 13). He now took the vow of silence for five years, for he was determined not to write on philosophy until he had passed through this wholesome discipline. These five years were passed mostly in Pamphylia and Cilicia, and though he spen t much time in study, he did not immure himself in a community or monastery but kept moving about and travelling from city to city. The temptations to break his self-imposed vow were enormous. His strange appearance drew everyone's at tention, the laughter-loving populace made the silent philosophe r the butt of their unscrupulous wit, and all the protection he h ad against their scurrility and misconceptions was the dignity of his mien and the glance of eyes that now could see both past and future.

Even at this early age he had begun to correct abuses. With eyes and hands and mo tions of the head, he made his meaning understood, and on one oc casion, at Aspendus in Pamphylia, prevented a serious corn rio t by silencing the crowd with his commanding gestures an d then writing what he had to say on his tablets (i. 15). So far, apparently, Philostratus has been dependent upon the account of Maximus of Ægæ, or perhaps only up to th e time of Apollonius’ quitting Ægæ. There is now a considerab le gap in the narrative, and two short chapters of vague gene ralities (i. 16, 17) are all that Philostratus can produce as the re cord of some fifteen or twenty * years, until Damis’ notes begin. After the five years of silence, we find Apollonius at Antioch, but this seems to be only an incident in a long rou nd of travel and work, and it is probable that Philostratus brin gs Antioch into prominence merely because what little he had learnt of this period of Apollonius’ life, he picked up in this mu ch-frequented city. p. 70 [paragraph continues] Even from Philostratus himsel f we learn incidentally later on (i. 20; iv. 38) that Apolloni us had spent some time among the Arabians, and had been instruct ed by them. And by Arabia we are to understand the countr y south of Palestine, which was at this period a regular hot-b ed of mystic communities. The spots he visited were in out-of-th e-way places, where the spirit of holiness lingered, and not the crowded and disturbed cities, for the subject of hi s conversation, he said, required \" men and not people.\" * He spent his time in"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 travelling from one to another of these temples, sh rines, and communities; from which we may conclude that there was some kind of a common freemasonry, as it were, among the m, of the nature of initiation, which opened the door of hosp itality to him.

At sun-rise he practised certa in religious exercises alone, the nature of which he communicate d only to those who had passed through the discipline of a \"f our years\" (? five years’) silence. He then conversed with the te mple priests or the heads of the community, according as he was staying in a Greek or non-Greek temple with public rites, p. 71 or in a community with a discipline peculiar to its elf apart from the public cult. * He thus endeavoured to bring back the public cults to the purity of their ancient traditions, and to suggest improve ments in the practices of the private brotherhoods. The most imp ortant part of his work was with those who were following the inne r life, and who already looked upon Apollonius as a teacher of the hidden way. To these his comrades ( ἑ ταίρους ) and pupils ( ὁ \u0010ιλητάς ), he devoted much attention, being ever ready to answ er their questions and give advice and instruction. Not howe ver that he neglected the people; it was his invariable custom to teach them, but always after midday; for those who lived the in ner life, † he said, should on day's dawning enter the presence of the Gods, ‡ then spend the time till mid-day in giving and rece iving instruction in holy things, and not till after noon devote themselves to human affairs.

As his story advances, it is true it ta kes on a soberer tint; but what Damis omits, Philostratus is ever re ady to supply from his own store of marvels, if chance offers. Nevertheless, even were we with the scalpel of crit icism to cut away every morsel of flesh from this body of tradit ion and legend, there would still remain a skeleton of fact that would still represent Apollonius and give us some idea of his stature. Apollonius was one of the greatest travellers known to antiquity. Among the countries and places he visited the follo wing are the chief ones recorded by Philostratus. * From Ninus (i. 19) Apollonius journeys to Babylon ( i. 21), where he stops one year and eight months (i. 40) an d visits surrounding cities such as Ecbatana, the capital of Media (i. 39); from Babylon to the Indian frontier no names p. 76 are mentioned; India was entered in every probabili ty by the Khaibar Pass (ii. 6), * for the first city mentioned is Taxila (Attock) (ii. 20); and so they make their way acros s the tributaries of the Indus (ii. 43) to the valley of the Ganges (iii. 5), and finally arrive at the \"monastery of the wis e men\" (iii. 10), where Apollonius spends four months (iii. 50). This monastery was presumably in Nepal; it is in the mountains, and the \"city\" nearest it is called Paraca. The cha os that Philostratus has made of Damis’ account, and before him the wonderful transformations Damis himself wrought in Indian names, are presumably shown in this word. Paraca is perchance all that Damis could make of Bharata, the general n ame of the Ganges valley in which the dominant Ā ryas were settled. It is also probable that these wise men were Buddhists, f or they"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 dwelt in a τ ύ ρσις , a place that looked like a fort or fortress to Damis. I have little doubt that Philostratus could p. 77 make nothing out of the geography of India from the names in Damis’ diary; they were all unfamiliar to him, so t hat as soon as he has exhausted the few Greek names known to him f rom the accounts of the expedition of Alexander, he wanders in the \"ends of the earth,\" and can make nothing of it til l he picks up our travellers again on their return journey at the mouth of the Indus. The salient fact that Apollonius was making for a certain community, which was his peculiar goal, so impresse d the imagination of Philostratus (and perhaps of Damis b efore him) that he has described it as being the only centre o f the kind in India. Apollonius went to India with a purpose and returned from it with a distinct mission; * and perchance his constant inquiries concerning the particular \"wise men\" whom he was seeking, led Damis to imagine that they alone were the \"Gymnosophists,\" the \"naked philosophers\" (if we ar e to take the term in its literal sense) of popular Greek leg end, which ignorantly ascribed to all the Hindu ascetics the m ost striking peculiarity of a very small number. But to return t o our itinerary. Philostratus embellishes the account of the voyage from the Indus to the mouth of the p. 78 Euphrates (iii. 52-58) with the travellers' tales a nd names of islands and cities he has gleaned from the Indica w hich where accessible to him, and so we again return to Babylo n and familiar geography with the following itinerary: Babylon, Ninus, Antioch, Seleucia, Cyprus; thence t o Ionia (iii. 58), where he spends some time in Asia Minor, espec ially at Ephesus (iv. 1), Smyrna (iv. 5), Pergamus (iv. 9), and Troy (iv."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 11). Thence Apollonius crosses over to Lesbos (iv. 13), and subsequently sails for Athens, where he spends some years in Greece (iv. 17-33) visiting the temples of Hellas, reforming their rites and instructing the priests (iv. 24). We next find him in Crete (iv. 34), and subsequently at Rome in the tim e of Nero (iv. 36-46). In A . D . 66 Nero issued a decree forbidding any philosophe r to remain in Rome, and Apollonius set out for Spain, a nd landed at Gades, the modern Cadiz; he seems to have stayed in Spain only a short time (iv. 47); thence crossed to Africa, an d so by sea once more to Sicily, where the principal cities and temples were visited (v. 11-14). Thence Apollonius returned to Greece (v . 18), four years having elapsed since his landing at Athens fr om Lesbos (v. 19). * p. 79 From Piræus our philosopher sails for Chios (v. 21) , thence to Rhodes, and so to Alexandria (v. 24). At Alexandria he spends some time, and has several interviews with the futu re Emperor Vespasian (v. 27-41), and thence he sets out on a l ong journey up the Nile as far as Ethiopia beyond the cataracts , where he visits an interesting community of ascetics called loosely Gymnosophists (vi. 1-27). On his return to Alexandria (vi. 28), he was summon ed by Titus, who had just become emperor, to meet him at Tarsus (vi. 29- 34). After this interview he appears to have return ed to Egypt, for Philostratus speaks vaguely of his spending som e time in Lower Egypt, and of visits to the Phoenicians, Cili cians, Ionians, Achæans, and also to Italy (vi. 35). Now Vespasian was emperor from 69 to 79, and Titus from 79 to 81. As Apollonius’ interviews with Vespasian too k place shortly before the beginning of that emperor's reig n, it is reasonable to conclude that a number of years was s pent by our"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 philosopher in his Ethiopian journey, and that ther efore Damis’ account is a most imperfect one. In 81 Domitian bec ame emperor, and just as Apollonius opposed the p. 80 follies of Nero, so did he criticise the acts of Do mitian. He accordingly became an object of suspicion to the em peror; but instead of keeping away from Rome, he determined to brave the tyrant to his face. Crossing from Egypt to Greece a nd taking ship at Corinth, he sailed by way of Sicily to Pute oli, and thence to the Tiber mouth, and so to Rome (vii. 10-16). He re Apollonius was tried and acquitted (vii. 17–viii. 1 0). Sailing from Puteoli again Apollonius returned to Greece (v iii. 15), where he spent two years (viii. 24). Thence once mo re he crossed over to Ionia at the time of the death of D omitian (viii. 25), visiting Smyrna and Ephesus and other of his f avourite haunts.

Therefore the trial of Apollonius at Ro me took place somewhere about 93, and we have a gap of twelve yea rs from his interview with Titus in 81, which Philostratus can only fill up with a few vague stories and generalities.

But if he were still young (say thirty years old or so) when he left for India, he must p. 79 ei ther have spent a very long period in that country, or we have a ve ry imperfect record of his doings in Asia Minor, Greece, Italy, and Spain, after his return. IN THE SHRINES OF THE TEMPLES AND THE RETREATS OF RELIGION S EEING that the nature of Apollonius’ business with the p riests of the temples and the devotees of the mystic life was necessarily of a most intimate and secret nature, f or in those days it was the invariable custom to draw a sharp l ine of demarcation between the inner and outer, the initia ted and the profane, it is not to be expected that we can learn anything but mere externalities from the Damis-Philostratus narr ative; nevertheless, even these outer indications are of i nterest. The temple of Æsculapius at Ægæ, where Apollonius s pent the most impressionable years of his life, was one of t he innumerable hospitals of Greece, where the healing art was practised on lines totally different to our present methods. We are at once introduced to an atmosphere laden with psychic influences, to a centre whither for centuries patie nts had flocked to \"consult p. 83 the God.\" In order to do so, it was necessary for t hem to go through certain preliminary purifications and follo w certain rules given by the priests; they then passed the ni ght in the shrine and in their sleep instructions were given t hem for their healing. This method, no doubt, was only resorted t o when the skill of the priest was exhausted; in any case, the priests must"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 have been deeply versed in the interpretation of th ese dreams and in their rationale. It is also evident that as Apollonius loved to pass his time in the temple, he must have found there satisfaction for his spiritual needs, and instructi on in the inner science; though doubtless his own innate powers soo n carried him beyond his instructors and marked him out as th e \"favourite of the God.\" The many cases on record in our own da y of patients in trance or some other psychic condition prescribing for themselves, will help the student to understand the innumerable possibilities of healing which were in Greece summed up in the personification Æsculapius. Later on the chief of the Indian sages has a disqui sition on Æsculapius and the healing art put into his mouth ( iii. 44), where the whole of medicine is said to be dependent upon psychic diagnosis and prescience ( παντεία ). Finally it may be noticed that it was the invariabl e custom of patients on their recovery to p. 84 record the fact on an ex-voto tablet in the temple, precisely as is done to-day in Roman Catholic countries. * On his way to India Apollonius saw a good deal of t he Magi at Babylon. He used to visit them at mid-day and mid-n ight, but of what transpired Damis knew nothing, for Apollonius would not permit him to accompany him, and in answer to his d irect questions would only answer: \"They are wise, but no t in all things\" (i. 26). The description of a certain hall, however, to whic h Apollonius had access, seems to be a garbled version of the in terior of the temple. The roof was dome-shaped, and the ceiling w as covered with \"sapphire\"; in this blue heaven were models of the heavenly bodies (\"those whom they regard as Gods\") fashioned in gold, as though moving in the ether. Moreover fr om the roof were suspended four golden \"Iygges\" which the Magi call the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 \"Tongues of the Gods.\" These were winged-wheels or spheres connected with the idea of Adrasteia (or Fate). The ir prototypes are described imperfectly in the Vision of Ezekiel, and the so- called Hecatine strophali or spherulæ used in magical practices p. 85 may have been degenerate descendants of these \"livi ng wheels\" or spheres of the vital elements. The subject is on e of intense interest, but hopelessly incapable of treatment in our present age of scepticism and profound ignorance of the past. T he \"Gods\" who taught our infant humanity were, according to o ccult tradition, from a humanity higher than that at pres ent evolving on our earth. They gave the impulse, and, when the earth- children were old enough to stand on their own feet , they withdrew. But the memory of their deeds and a corru pt and degenerate form of the mysteries they established h as ever lingered in the memory of myth and legend. Seers ha ve caught obscure glimpses of what they taught and how they t aught it, and the tradition of the Mysteries preserved some m emory of it in its symbols and instruments or engines. The Iygg es of the Magi are said to be a relic of this memory. With regard to the Indian sages it is impossible to make out any consistent story from the fantastic jumble of the D amis- Philostratus romance. Damis seems to have confused together a mixture of memories and scraps of gossip without an y attempt to distinguish one community or sect from another, and so produced a blurred daub which Philostratus would ha ve us regard as a picture of the \"hill\" and a description p. 86 of its \"sages.\" Damis’ confused memories, * however, have little to do with the actual monastery and its ascetic inh abitants, who were the goal of Apollonius’ long journey. What Apo llonius heard and saw there, following his invariable custo m in such circumstances, he told no one, not even Damis, exce pt what could be derived from the following enigmatical sen tence: \"I"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 saw men dwelling on the earth and yet not on it, de fended on all sides, yet without any defence, and yet possessed o f nothing but what all possess.\" These words occur in two passage s (iii. 15 and vi. 11), and in both Philostratus adds that Apo llonius wrote † and spoke them enigmatically. The meaning of this saying is not difficult to divine. They were on the earth, but not of the earth, for their minds were set on things ab ove. They were protected by their innate spiritual power, of which we have so many instances in Indian literature; and yet they p ossessed nothing but what all men possess if they would but develop the spiritual part of their being. But this explanation is not simple enough for Philostratus, and so he presses into p. 87 service all the memories of Damis, or rather travel lers' tales, about levitation, magical illusions and the rest. The head of the community is called Iarchas, a tota lly un-Indian name. The violence done to all foreign names by the Greeks is notorious, and here we have to reckon with an army of ignorant copyists as well as with Philostratus and Damis. I would suggest that the name may perhaps be a corruption of Arhat. * The main burden of Damis’ narrative insists on the psychic and spiritual knowledge of the sages. They know what ta kes place at a distance, they can tell the past and future, and read the past births of men. The messenger sent to meet Apollonius carried what Damis calls a golden anchor (iii. 11, 17), and if this is an authentic fact, it would suggest a forerunner of the Tibetan dorje , the present degenerate symbol of the \"rod of power,\" something like the thunder-bolt wielded by Zeus. This would also point to a Buddhist community, though it must be confessed tha t other indications point equally strongly to Br ā hmanical customs, such as the caste-mark on the forehead of the messenger (iii. 7, 11), the carrying of (bamboo) staves ( dan\td\t a), letting the hair grow long, and wearing of turbans (iii. 13). But indeed the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 p. 88 whole account is too confused to permit any hope of extracting historical details. Of the nature of Apollonius’ visit we may, however, judge from the following mysterious letter to his hosts (iii. 51): \"I came to you by land and ye have given me the sea ; nay, rather, by sharing with me your wisdom ye have give n me power to travel through heaven. These things will I bring back to the mind of the Greeks, and I will hold converse with you as though ye were present, if it be that I have not dr unk of the cup of Tantalus in vain. It is evident from these cryptic sentences that the \"sea\" and the \"cup of Tantalus\" are identical with the \"wisdom\" w hich had been imparted to Apollonius—the wisdom which he was to bring back once more to the memory of the Greeks. H e thus clearly states that he returned from India with a d istinct mission and with the means to accomplish it, for not only h ad he drunk of the ocean of wisdom in that he has learnt the Br ahma-vidy ā from their lips, but he has also learnt how to conv erse with them though his body be in Greece and their bodies in In dia. But such a plain meaning—plain at least to every st udent of occult nature—was beyond the understanding of Damis or the comprehension of Philostratus. And it is doubtless the mention p. 89 of the \"cup of Tantalus\" * in this letter which suggested the inexhaustible loving cup episode in iii. 32, and it s connection with the mythical fountains of Bacchus. Damis press es it into service to \"explain\" the last phrase in Apollonius’ saying about the sages, namely, that they were \"possessed of not hing but what all possess\"—which, however, appears elsewhere in a changed form, as \"possessing nothing, they have the possessions of all men\" (iii. 15). † "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 On returning to Greece, one of the first shrines Ap ollonius visited was that of Aphrodite at Paphos in Cyprus ( iii. 58). The greatest external peculiarity of the Paphian worshi p of Venus was the representation of the goddess by a mysterio us stone symbol. It seems to have been of the size of a huma n being, but shaped like a pine-cone, only of course with a smoo th surface. Paphos was apparently the oldest shrine dedicated t o Venus in Greece. Its mysteries were very ancient, but not in digenous; they were brought over from the mainland, from what was subsequently Cilicia, in times of remote antiquity. p. 90 [paragraph continues] The worship or consultation o f the Goddess was by means of prayers and the \"pure flame of fire,\" and the temple was a great centre of divination. * Apollonius spent some time here and instructed the priests at length with regard to their sacred rites. In Asia Minor he was especially pleased with the te mple of Æsculapius at Pergamus; he healed many of the patie nts there, and gave instruction in the proper methods to adopt in order to procure reliable results by means of the prescripti ve dreams. At Troy, we are told, Apollonius spent a night alon e at the tomb of Achilles, in former days one of the spots of gre atest popular sanctity in Greece (iv. 11). Why he did so does not transpire, for the fantastic conversation with the shade of the he ro reported by Philostratus (iv. 16) seems to be devoid of any ele ment of likelihood. As, however, Apollonius made it his bus iness to visit Thessaly shortly afterwards expressly to urge the T hessalians to renew the old accustomed rites to the hero (iv. 13) , we may suppose that it formed part of his great effort to restore and purify the old institutions of Hellas, so that, the accustomed channels being freed, the life might flow more heal thily in the national body. p. 91"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 Rumour would also have it that Achilles had told Ap ollonius where he would find the statue of the hero Palamede s on the coast of Æolia. Apollonius accordingly restored the statue, and Philostratus tells us he had seen it with his own e yes on the spot (iv. 13). Now this would be a matter of very little interest, were it not that a great deal is made of Palamedes elsewhere in Philostratus’ narrative. What it all means is difficult to say wi th a Damis and Philostratus as interpreters between ourselves and the silent and enigmatical Apollonius. Palamedes was one of the heroes before Troy, who wa s fabled to have invented letters, or to have completed the alphabet of Cadmus. * Now from two obscure sayings (iv. 13, 33), we glean that our philosopher looked upon Palamedes as the philosophe r-hero of the Trojan period, although Homer says hardly a wor d about him. Was this, then, the reason why Apollonius was so an xious to restore his statue? Not altogether so; there appear s to have been a more direct reason. Damis would have it that Apol lonius had met Palamedes in India; that he was at the monaster y; that Iarchas had one day pointed out a young ascetic who could \"write without ever learning letters\"; and that p. 92 this youth had been no other than Palamedes in one of his former births. Doubtless the sceptic will say: \"Of course! Pythagoras was a reincarnation of the hero Euphorbu s who fought at Troy, according to popular superstition; therefore, naturally, the young Indian was the reincarnation o f the hero Palamedes! The one legend simply begat the other.\" But on this principle, to be consistent, we should expect to fi nd that it was Apollonius himself and not an unknown Hindu ascetic , who had been once Palamedes."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 In any case Apollonius restored the rites to Achill es, and erected a chapel in which he set up the neglected statue of Palamedes. * The heroes of the Trojan period, then, it would see m, had still some connection with Greece, according to the scien ce of the invisible world into which Apollonius was initiated . And if the Protestant sceptic can make nothing of it, at least the Roman Catholic reader may be induced to suspend his judgm ent by changing \"hero\" into \"saint.\" Can it be possible that the attention which Apollon ius bestowed upon the graves and funeral monuments of the mighty dead of Greece may have been inspired by the circle of idea s which p. 93 led to the erection of the innumerable d ā gobas and st ū pas in Buddhist lands, originally over the relics of the B uddha, and the subsequent preservation of relics of arhats and gre at teachers? At Lesbos Apollonius visited the ancient temple of the Orphic mysteries, which in early years had been a great ce ntre of prophecy and divination. Here also he was privilege d to enter the inner shrine or adytum (iv. 14). The Tyanean arrived in Athens at the time of the El eusinian Mysteries, and in spite of the festival and rites n ot only the people but also the candidates flocked to meet him to the neglect of their religious duties. Apollonius rebuked them, and himself joined in the necessary preliminary rites and prese nted himself for initiation. It may, perhaps, surprise the reader to hear that A pollonius, who had already been initiated into higher privileges t han Eleusis could afford, should present himself for initiation .

To restore these ancient rites to their purity, or to p. 94 utilise them for their original object, it was nece ssary to enter within the precincts of the institution; nothing co uld be effected from outside. The thing itself was good, and Apollo nius desired to support the ancient institution by setting the p ublic example of seeking initiation therein; not that he had anyt hing to gain personally. But whether it was that the hierophant of that time was only ignorant, or whether he was jealous of the great in fluence of Apollonius, he refused to admit our philosopher, on the ground that he was a sorcerer ( γόης ), and that no one could be initiated who was tainted by intercourse with evil entities ( δαι\u0010όνια ). To this charge Apollonius replied with veiled irony: \" You have omitted the most serious charge that might have bee n urged against me: to wit, that though I really know more about the mystic rite than its hierophant, I have come here p retending to desire initiation from men knowing more than myself .\" This charge would have been true; he had made a pretence . Dismayed at these words, frightened at the indignat ion of the people aroused by the insult offered to their disti nguished guest, and overawed by the presence of a knowledge which h e could no longer deny, the hierophant begged our philosoph er to accept the initiation. But Apollonius p. 95 refused. \"I will be initiated later on,\" he replied ; \" he will initiate me.\" This is said to have referred to the succeedin g hierophant, who presided when Apollonius was initiated four yea rs later (iv. 18; y. 19)."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 While at Athens Apollonius spoke strongly against t he effeminacy of the Bacchanalia and the barbarities o f the gladiatorial combats (iv. 21, 22). The temples, mentioned by Philostratus, which Apoll onius visited in Greece, have all the peculiarity of bein g very ancient; for instance, Dodona, Delphi, the ancient shrine of Apollo at Abæ in Phocis, the \"caves\" of Amphiaraus * and Trophonius, and the temple of the Muses on Helicon. When he entered the adyta of these temples for the purpose of \"restoring\" the rites, he was accompanied only by t he priests, and certain of his immediate disciples ( γν ώ ρι\u0010οι ). This suggests an extension to the meaning of the word \"restoring\" or \"reforming,\" and when we read elsewhere of the many spots consecrated by Apollonius, we cannot but think that part of his work was the reconsecration, and hence psychic puri fication, of many of these ancient centres. His main external wo rk, however, was the p. 96 giving of instruction, and, as Philostratus rhetori cally phrases it, \"bowls of his words were set up everywhere for the thirsty to drink from\" (iv. 24). But not only did our philosopher restore the ancien t rites of religion, he also paid much attention to the ancien t polities and institutions. Thus we find him urging with success the Spartans to return to their ancient mode of life, their athl etic exercises, frugal living, and the discipline of the old Dorian tradition (iv. 27, 31-34); he, moreover, specially praised the ins titution of the Olympic Games, the high standard of which was still maintained (iv. 29), while he recalled the ancient Amphictioni c Council to its duty (iv. 23), and corrected the abuses of the Panionian assembly (iv. 5).

D ., who was also a philosopher and a deep student of religion (iv. 4 0). But his stay in the imperial city was speedily cut short, for in October Nero crowned his persecution of the philosophers by publ ishing a decree of banishment against them from Rome, and bo th Telesinus (vii. 11) and Apollonius had to leave Ita ly.

But to reform the public cults of Egypt was a far more dif ficult task than any he had previously attempted.

Many abuses he trie d to reform in the manners of the Alexandrians, but upon none was he more severe than on their wild excitement over horse-rac ing, which frequently led to bloodshed (v. 26).

Had Philostratus devoted a chapter or two to the na ture of the practices, discipline, and doctrines of the innumer able ascetic and mystic communities that honeycombed Egypt and a djacent lands in those days, he would have earned the bound less gratitude of students of the origins. But of all th is he has no word; and yet he would have us believe that Damis’ reminiscences were an orderly series of notes of wh at actually happened. But in all things it is very apparent tha t Damis was rather a compagnon de voyage than an initiated pupil. Who then were these mysterious \"Gymnosophists,\" p. 100"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 as they are usually called, and whence their name? Damis calls them simply the \"Naked\" ( γυ\u0010νοί ), and it is very clear that the term is not to be understood as merely physically n aked; indeed, neither to the Indians nor to these ascetics of upp ermost Egypt can the term be applied with appropriateness in its purely physical meaning, as is apparent from the descripti ons of Damis and Philostratus. A chance sentence that falls from the lips of one of these ascetics, in giving the story of his l ife, affords us a clue to the real meaning of the term. \"At the age o f fourteen,\" he tells Apollonius, \"I resigned my patrimony to those who desired such things, and naked I sought the Naked \" (vi. 16). * This is the very same diction that Philo uses about the Therapeut communities, which he declares were very numerous i n every province of Egypt and scattered in all lands. We ar e not, however, to suppose that these communities were all of the same nature. It is true that Philo tries to make ou t that the most pious and the chief of all of them was his particular community p. 101 on the southern shore of Lake Mœris, which was stro ngly Semitic if not orthodoxly Jewish; and for Philo any community with a Jewish atmosphere must naturally have been t he best. The peculiarity and main interest of our community, which was at the other end of the land above the cataracts, w as that it had had some remote connection with India. The community is called a φροντιστ ή ριον , in the sense of a place for meditation, a term used by ecclesiastical writers for a monastery, but best known to classical students fro m the humorous use made of it by Aristophanes, who in The Clouds calls the school of Socrates, a phrontist ē rion or \"thinking shop.\" The collection of monasteria ( ἱ ερά ), presumably caves, shrines, or cells, * was situated on a hill or rising ground not far fr om the Nile. They were all separated from one another, dot ted about the hill, and ingeniously arranged. There was hardly a tree in the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 place, with the exception of a single group of palm s, under whose shade they held their general meetings (vi. 6 ). It is difficult to gather from the set speeches, pu t into the mouths of the head of the community and Apollonius (vi. 10 -13, 18-22), any precise details as to the mode of life of these p. 102 ascetics, beyond the general indications of an exis tence of great toil and physical hardship, which they considered t he only means of gaining wisdom. What the nature of their c ult was, if they had one, we are not told, except that at midda y the Naked retired to their monasteria (vi. 14). The whole tendency of Apollonius’ arguments, howeve r, is to remind the community of its Eastern origin and its former connection with India, which it seems to have forgo tten. The communities of this particular kind in southern Egy pt and northern Ethiopia dated back presumably some centur ies, and some of them may have been remotely Buddhist, for o ne of the younger members of our community who left it to fol low Apollonius, says that he came to join it from the e nthusiastic account of the wisdom of the Indians brought back b y his father, who had been captain of a vessel trading to the Eas t. It was his father who told him that these \"Ethiopians\" were fr om India, and so he had joined them instead of making the long an d perilous journey to the Indus itself (vi. 16). If there be any truth in this story it follows that the founders of this way of life had been Indian ascetics, and if s o they must have belonged to the only propagandising form of In dian religion, namely, the Buddhist. After the impulse had been given, the communities, p. 103"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 which were presumably recruited from generations of Egyptians, Arabs, and Ethiopians, were probably lef t entirely to themselves, and so in course of time forgot their o rigin, and even perhaps their original rule. Such speculations are permissible, owing to the repeated assertion of the original connection between these Gymnosophists and India. T he whole burden of the story is that they were Indians who h ad forgotten their origin and fallen away from the wisdom. The last incident that Philostratus records with re gard to Apollonius among the shrines and temples is a visit to the famous and very ancient oracle of Trophonius, near Lebadea, in Bœotia. Apollonius is said to have spent seven days alone in this mysterious \"cave,\" and to have returned with a book full of questions and answers on the subject of \"philosophy \" (viii. 19). This book was still, in the time of Philostratus, i n the palace of Hadrian at Antium, together with a number of letter s of Apollonius, and many people used to visit Antium fo r the special purpose of seeing it (viii. 19, 20). In the hay-bundle of legendary rigmarole solemnly s et down by Philostratus concerning the cave of Trophonius, a s mall needle of truth may perhaps be discovered. The \"cave\" seem s to have been a very ancient temple or shrine, cut in the he art of a hill, to which a number of underground p. 104 passages of considerable length led. It had probabl y been in ancient times one of the most holy centres of the a rchaic cult of Hellas, perhaps even a relic of that Greece of thou sands of years B . C ., the only tradition of which, as Plato tell us, w as obtained by Solon from the priests of Saïs. Or it may have b een a subterranean shrine of the same nature as the famou s Dictæan cave in Crete which only last year was brought back to light by the indefatigable labours of Messrs. Evans and Hoga rth. As in the case of the travels of Apollonius, so wit h regard to the temples and communities which he visited, Philostra tus is a"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 most disappointing cicerone. But perhaps he is not to be blamed on this account, for the most important and most in teresting part of Apollonius’ work was of so intimate a nature, pr osecuted as it was among associations of such jealously-guarded se crecy, that no one outside their ranks could know anything of i t, and those who shared in their initiation would say nothing. It is, therefore, only when Apollonius comes forwar d to do some public act that we can get any precise historical t race of him; in every other case he passes into the sanctuary of a temple or enters the privacy of a community and is lost to vi ew. It may perhaps surprise us that Apollonius, p. 105 after sacrificing his private fortune, could nevert heless undertake such long and expensive travels, but it w ould seem that he was occasionally supplied with the necessar y monies from the treasuries of the temples ( cf . viii. 17), and that everywhere he was freely offered the hospitality of the temple or community in the place where he happened to be stay ing. In conclusion of the present part of our subject, w e may mention the good service done by Apollonius in driving away certain Chaldæan and Egyptian charlatans who were making ca pital out of the fears of the cities on the left shores of th e Hellespont. These cities had suffered severely from shocks of e arthquake, and in their panic placed large sums of money in th e hands of these adventurers (who \"trafficked in the misfortun es of others\"), in order that they might perform propitia tory rites (vi. 41). This taking money for the giving instruction i n the sacred science or for the performance of sacred rites was the most detestable of crimes to all the true philosophers. "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 Footnotes 100:* The word γυ\u0010νός (naked), however, usually means lightly clad, as, for instance, when a man is said to ploug h \"naked,\" that is with only one garment, and this is evident from the comparison made between the costume of the Gymnosop hists and that of people in the hot weather at Athens (vi . 6). 101:* For they had neither huts nor houses, but lived in the open air. APOLLONIUS AND THE RULERS OF THE EMPIRE B UT not only did Apollonius vivify and reconsecrate th e old centres of religion for some inscrutable reason, an d do what he could to help on the religious life of the time in its multiplex phases, but he took a decided, though indirect, par t in influencing the destinies of the Empire through the persons of its supreme rulers. This influence, however, was invariably of a moral and not of a political nature. It was brought to bear by means o f philosophical converse and instruction, by word of mouth or letter. Just as Apollonius on his travels conversed on philosophy, and discoursed on the life of a wise ma n and the duties of a wise ruler, with kings, * rulers, and magistrates, so he endeavoured to advise for their good those of the e mperors who would listen to him. p. 107 Vespasian, Titus, and Nerva were all, prior to thei r elevation to the purple, friends and admirers of Apollonius, whi le Nero and Domitian regarded the philosopher with dismay. During Apollonius’ short stay in Rome, in 66 A . D ., although he never let the slightest word escape him that could be construed by the numerous informers into a treasonable uttera nce, he was nevertheless brought before Tigellinus, the infamou s favourite"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 of Nero, and subjected to a severe cross-examinatio n. Apparently up to this time Apollonius, working for the future, had confined his attention entirely to the reformat ion of religion and the restoration of the ancient institutions of the nations, but the tyrannical conduct of Nero, which gave peace no t even to the most blameless philosophers, at length opened h is eyes to a more immediate evil, which seemed no less than the abrogation of the liberty of conscience by an irresponsible ty ranny. From this time onwards, therefore, we find him keenly in terested in the persons of the successive emperors. Indeed Damis, although he confesses his entire igno rance of the purpose of Apollonius’ journey to Spain after his e xpulsion from Rome, would have it that it was to aid the for thcoming revolt against Nero. He conjectures this from a thr ee days’ secret interview that Apollonius had with p. 108 the Governor of the Province of Bætica, who came to Cadiz especially to see him, and declares that the last w ords of Apollonius’ visitor were: \"Farewell, and remember V index\" (v. 10). It is true that almost immediately afterwards the r evolt of Vindex, the Governor of Gaul, broke out, but the wh ole life and character of Apollonius is opposed to any idea of p olitical intrigue; on the contrary, he bravely withstood tyr anny and injustice to the face. He was opposed to the idea o f Euphrates, a philosopher of quite a different stamp, who would h ave put an end to the monarchy and restored the republic (v. 3 3); he believed that government by a monarch was the best for the Empire, but he desired above all other things to se e the \"flock of mankind\" led by a \"wise and faithful shepherd\" (v. 35). So that though Apollonius supported Vespasian as lo ng as he worthily tried to follow out this ideal, he immedia tely rebuked him to his face when he deprived the Greek cities o f their privileges. \"You have enslaved Greece,\" he wrote. \" You have"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 reduced a free people to slavery\" (v. 41). Neverthe less, in spite of this rebuke, Vespasian in his last letter to his son Titus, confesses that they are what they are solely owing to the good advice of Apollonius (v. 30). p. 109 Equally so he journeyed to Rome to meet Domitian fa ce to face, and though he was put on trial and every effort mad e to prove him guilty of treasonable plotting with Nerva, he c ould not be convicted of anything of a political nature. Nerva was a good man, he told the emperor, and no traitor. Not that Domitian had really any suspicion that Apollonius was personally plotting against him; he cast him into prison solely in the hope that he might induce the philosopher to disclose the confid ences of Nerva and other prominent men who were objects of s uspicion to him, and who he imagined had consulted Apolloniu s on their chances of success. Apollonius’ business was not wi th politics, but with the \"princes who asked him for his advice on the subject of virtue\" (vi. 43). Footnotes 106:* He spent, we are told, no less than a year and eig ht months with Vardan, King of Babylon, and was the ho noured guest of the Indian R ā j ā h \"Phraotes.\" APOLLONIUS THE PROPHET AND WONDER- WORKER W E will now turn our attention for a brief space to t hat side of Apollonius’ life which has made him the subject of invincible prejudice. Apollonius was not only a philosopher, i n the sense of being a theoretical speculator or of being the foll ower of an ordered mode of life schooled in the discipline of resignation; he was also a philosopher in the original Pythagorean meaning of"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 the term—a knower of Nature's secrets, who thus cou ld speak as one having authority. He knew the hidden things of Nature by sight and no t by hearing; for him the path of philosophy was a life whereby the man himself became an instrument of knowing. Religi on, for Apollonius, was not a faith only, it was a science. For him the shows of things were but ever-changing appearances; cults and rites, religions and faiths, were all one to him, p rovided the right spirit were behind them. The Tyanean p. 111 knew no differences of race or creed; such narrow l imitations were not for the philosopher. Beyond all others would he have laughed to hear the word \"miracle\" applied to his doings. \"Miracle,\" in its Christian theological sense, was an unknown term in antiquity , and is a vestige of superstition to-day. For though many bel ieve that it is possible by means of the soul to effect a multitude of things beyond the possibilities of a science which is conf ined entirely to the investigation of physical forces, none but t he unthinking believe that there can be any interference in the w orking of the laws which Deity has impressed upon Nature—the cred o of Miraculists. Most of the recorded wonder-doings of Apollonius ar e cases of prophecy or foreseeing; of seeing at a distance and seeing the past; of seeing or hearing in vision; of healing th e sick or curing cases of obsession or possession. Already as a youth, in the temple at Ægæ, Apolloniu s gave signs of the possession of the rudiments of this psychic insight; not only did he sense correctly the nature of the dark past of a rich but unworthy suppliant who desired the restoration of his eyesight, but he foretold, though unclearly, the ev il end of one who made an attempt upon his innocence (i. 12)."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 On meeting with Damis, his future faithful p. 112 henchman volunteered his services for the long jour ney to India on the ground that he knew the languages of several of the countries through which they had to pass. \"But I un derstand them all, though I have learned none of them,\" answ ered Apollonius, in his usual enigmatical fashion, and a dded: \"Marvel not that I know all the tongues of men, for I know even what they never say\" (i. 19). And by this he meant simply that he could read men's thoughts, not that he could spe ak all languages. But Damis and Philostratus cannot unders tand so simple a fact of psychic experience; they will have it that he knew not only the language of all men, but also of birds and beasts (i. 20). In his conversation with the Babylonian monarch Var dan, Apollonius distinctly claims foreknowledge. He says that he is a physician of the soul and can free the king from th e diseases of the mind, not only because he knows what ought to b e done, that is to say the proper discipline taught in the Pytha gorean and similar schools, but also because he foreknows the nature of the king (i. 32). Indeed we are told that the subject o f foreknowledge ( προγν ώ σεως ), of which science ( σοφία ) Apollonius was a deep student, was one of the princ ipal topics discussed by our philosopher and his Indian hosts ( iii. 42). In fact, as Apollonius tells his philosophical p. 113 and studious friend the Roman Consul Telesinus, for him wisdom was a kind of divinizing or making divine of the whole nature, a sort of perpetual state of inspiration ( θειασ\u0010ός ) (iv. 40). And so we are told that Apollonius was apprise d of all things of this nature by the energy of his dæmonial nature ( δαι\u0010ονίως ) (vii. 10). Now for the student of the Pythagorean and Platonic schools the \"dæmon\" of a man was what may be"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 called the higher self, the spiritual side of the s oul as distinguished from the purely human. It is the bett er part of the man, and when his physical consciousness is at-oned with this \"dweller in heaven,\" he has (according to the highe st mystic philosophy of ancient Greece) while still on earth the powers of those incorporeal intermediate beings between Gods and men called \"dæmons\"; a stage higher still, the living m an becomes at- oned with his divine soul, he becomes a God on eart h; and yet a stage higher he becomes at one with the Good and so becomes God. Hence we find Apollonius indignantly rejecting the accusation of magic ignorantly brought against him, an art whi ch achieved its results by means of compacts with those low ent ities with which the outermost realm of inner Nature swarms. O ur philosopher repudiated equally the idea of his bein g a soothsayer or diviner. p. 114 [paragraph continues] With such arts he would have nothing to do; if ever he uttered anything which savoured of foreknowledge, let them know it was not by divinati on in the vulgar sense, but owing to \"that wisdom which God r eveals to the wise\" (iv. 44). The most numerous wonder-doings ascribed to Apollon ius are instances precisely of such foreknowledge or prophe cy. * It must be confessed that the utterances recorded are often obscure and enigmatical, but this is the usual case with su ch prophecy; for future events are most frequently either seen i n symbolic representations, the meaning of which is not clear until after the event, or heard in equally enigmatical sentences. A t times, however, we have instances of very precise foreknow ledge, such as the refusal of Apollonius to go on board a vesse l which foundered on the voyage (v. 18). The instances of seeing present events at a distanc e, however— such as the burning of a temple at Rome, which Apol lonius saw"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 while at Alexandria—are clear enough. Indeed, if pe ople know nothing else of the Tyanean, they have at least hea rd how he saw at Ephesus the assassination of Domitian at Rom e at the very moment of its occurrence. p. 115 It was mid-day, to quote from the graphic account o f Philostratus, and Apollonius was in one of the smal l parks or groves in the suburbs, engaged in delivering an add ress on some absorbing topic of philosophy. \"At first he sank hi s voice as though in some apprehension; he, however, continued his exposition, but haltingly, and with far less force than usual, as a man who had some other subject in his mind than tha t on which he is speaking; finally he ceased speaking altogeth er as though he could not find his words. Then staring fixedly o n the ground, he started forward three or four paces, crying out: 'Strike the tyrant; strike!' And this, not like a man who sees an image in a mirror, but as one with the actual scene before his eyes, as though he were himself taking part in it.\" Turning to his astonished audience he told them wha t he had seen. But though they hoped it were true, they refu sed to believe it, and thought that Apollonius had taken leave of his senses. But the philosopher gently answered: You, on your p art, are right to suspend your rejoicings till the news is b rought you in the usual fashion; \"as for me, I go to return thank s to the Gods for what I have myself seen\" (viii. 26). Little wonder, then, if we read, not only of a numb er of symbolic dreams, but of their proper p. 116 interpretation, one of the most important branches of the esoteric discipline of the school. (See especially i. 23 and iv. 34.) Nor are we surprised to hear that Apollonius, relying entir ely on his inner knowledge, was instrumental in obtaining the reprieve of an innocent man at Alexandria, who was on the point of being"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 executed with a batch of criminals (v. 24). Indeed, he seems to have known the secret past of many with whom he cam e in contact (vi. 3, 5). The possession of such powers can put but little st rain on the belief of a generation like our own, to which such facts of psychic science are becoming with every day more fa miliar. Nor should instances of curing disease by mesmeric proc esses astonish us, or even the so-called \"casting out of evil spirits,\" if we give credence to the Gospel narrative and are fa miliar with the general history of the times in which such heal ing of possession and obsession was a commonplace. This, h owever, does not condemn us to any endorsement of the fanta stic descriptions of such happenings in which Philostrat us indulges. If it be credible that Apollonius was successful in dealing with obscure mental cases—cases of obsession and possess ion—with which our hospitals and asylums are filled to-day, and which are for the most part beyond the skill of official scie nce owing to its ignorance of the real agencies at work, it is equal ly evident p. 117 that Damis and Philostratus had little understandin g of the matter, and have given full rein to their imaginati on in their narratives. (See ii. 4; iv. 20, 25; v. 42; vi. 27, 43.) Perhaps, however, Philostratus in some instances is only rep eating popular legend, the best case of which is the curin g of the plague at Ephesus which the Tyanean had foretold on so many occasions. Popular legend would have it that the ca use of the plague was traced to an old beggar man, who was bur ied under a heap of stones by the infuriated populace. On Apoll onius ordering the stones to be removed, it was found tha t what had been a beggar man was now a mad dog foaming at the mouth (iv. 10) On the contrary, the account of Apollonius’ \"restor ing to life\" a young girl of noble birth at Rome, is told with gre at moderation. Our philosopher seems to have met the funeral proce ssion by"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 chance; whereupon he suddenly went up to the bier, and, after making some passes over the maiden, and saying some inaudible words, \"waked her out of her seeming deat h.\" But, says Damis, \"whether Apollonius noticed that the sp ark of the soul was still alive which her friends had failed t o perceive— they say it was raining lightly and a slight vapour showed on her face—or whether he made the life in her warn again and so restored her,\" p. 118 neither himself nor any who were present could say (iv. 45). Of a distinctly more phenomenal nature are the stor ies of Apollonius causing the writing to disappear from th e tablets of one of his accusers before Tigellinus (iv. 44); of his drawing his leg out of the fetters to show Damis that he was no t really a prisoner though chained in the dungeons of Domitian (vii. 38); and of his \"disappearing\" ( ἠ φανίσθη ) from the tribunal (viii. 5). * We are not, however, to suppose that Apollonius des pised or neglected the study of physical phenomena in his de votion to the inner science of things. On the contrary, we have s everal instances of his rejection of mythology in favour o f a physical explanation of natural phenomena. Such, for instanc e, are his explanations of the volcanic activity of Ætna (v. 1 4, 17), and of a tidal wave in Crete, the latter being accompanied with a correct indication of the more immediate result of the occurrence. In fact an island had been thrown up fa r out to sea by a submarine disturbance as was subsequently asce rtained (iv. 34). The explanation of the tides at Cadiz may also be placed in the same category (v. 2). "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 Footnotes 114:* See i. 22 (cf. 40), 34; iv. 4, 6, 18 (cf. v. 19), 24, 43; v. 7, 11, 13, 30, 37; vi. 32; viii. 26. 118:* This expression is, however, perhaps only to be ta ken as rhetorical, for in viii. 8, the incident is referre d to in the simple words \"when he departed ( ἀ π ῆ λθε ) from the tribunal.\" HIS MODE OF LIFE W E will now present the reader with some general indi cations of the mode of life of Apollonius, and the manner of h is teaching, of which already something has been said under the heading \"Early Life.\" Our philosopher was an enthusiastic follower of the Pythagorean discipline; nay, Philostratus would have us believe that he made more superhuman efforts to reach wisdom than even t he great Samian (i. 2). The outer forms of this discipline a s exemplified in Pythagoras are thus summed up by our author. \"Naught would he wear that came from a dead beast, nor touch a morsel of a thing that once had life, nor offer it in sacrifice; not for him to stain with blood the altars; but honey-c akes and incense, and the service of his song went upward fr om the man unto the Gods, for well he knew that they would tak e such gifts far rather than the oxen in their hundreds with p. 120 the knife. For he, in sooth, held converse with the Gods and learned from them how they were pleased with men an d how displeased, and thence as well he drew his nature-l ore. As for the rest, he said, they guessed at the divine, and held opinions on the Gods which proved each other false; but unto hi m Apollo's self did come, confessed, without disguise, * and there did come as well, though unconfessed, Athena and the Muses, and other Gods whose forms and names mankind did not yet know .\""},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 Hence his disciples regarded Pythagoras as an inspi red teacher, and received his rules as laws. \"In particular did they keep the rule of silence regarding the divine science. For t hey heard within them many divine and unspeakable things on w hich it would have been difficult for them to keep silence, had they not first learned that it was just this silence which s poke to them\" (i. 1). Such was the general declaration of the nature of t he Pythagorean discipline by its disciples. But, says Apollonius in his address to the Gymnosophists, Pythagoras was no t the inventor of it. It was the immemorial wisdom, and P ythagoras himself had learnt it from the Indians. † This wisdom, he continued, had spoken to him in his youth; she had said: p. 121 \"For sense, young sir, I have no charms; my cup is filled with toils unto the brim. Would anyone embrace my way of life, he must resolve to banish from his board all food that once bore life, to lose the memory of wine, and thus no more to wisdom's cup befoul—the cup that doth consist of wine-untain ted souls. Nor shall wool warm him, nor aught that's made from any beast. I give my servants shoes of bast and as they can to sleep. And if I find them overcome with love's delights, I've rea dy pits down into which that justice which doth follow hard on w isdom's foot, doth drag and thrust them; indeed, so stern am I to those who choose my way, that e’en upon their tongues I bind a chain. Now hear from me what things thou’lt gain, if thou endure. An innate sense of fitness and of right, and ne’er to feel that any’s lot is better than thy own; tyrants to strike with fear instead of being a fearsome slave to tyranny; to have the Gods more greatly bless thy scanty gifts than those who pour before them blood of bulls. If thou art pure, I'll give thee ho w to know what things will be as well, and fill thy eyes so full o f light, that thou may’st recognise the Gods, the heroes know, and pro ve and try the shadowy forms that feign the shapes of men\" (vi . 11)."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 p. 122 The whole life of Apollonius shows that he tried to carry out consistently this rule of life, and the repeated st atements that he would never join in the blood-sacrifices of the pop ular cults (see especially i. 24, 31; iv. 11; v. 25), but openly co ndemned them, show not only that the Pythagorean school had ever set the example of the higher way of purer offerings, but t hat they were not only not condemned and persecuted as heretics o n this account, but were rather regarded as being of pecul iar sanctity, and as following a life superior to that of ordinar y mortals. The refraining from the flesh of animals, however, was not simply based upon ideas of purity, it found additio nal sanction in the positive love of the lower kingdoms and the horror of inflicting pain on any living creature. Thus Apollo nius bluntly refused to take any part in the chase, when invited to do so by his royal host at Babylon. \"Sire,\" he replied, \"hav e you forgotten that even when you sacrifice I will not be present? Much less then would I do these beasts to death, and all the more when their spirit is broken and they are penned in contr ary to their nature\" (i. 38). * But though Apollonius was an unflinching task-maste r unto himself, he did not wish to p. 123 impose his mode of life on others, even on his pers onal friends and companions (provided of course they did not ado pt it of their own free will).

Three times a day Apollonius prayed and meditated; at daybreak (vi. 10, 18; vii. 31), at mid-day (vii. 10), and at sun-down (viii. 13). This seems to have been his invariable custom; no matter where he was he seems to have devoted at least a fe w moments to silent meditation at these times. The object of his worship is always said to have been the \"Sun,\" that is to say the Lord of our world and its sister worlds, whose glorious symbol is the orb of day.

His style of teaching and sp eaking was the opposite of that of a rhetorician or professional o rator. There was no art in his sentences, no striving after effe ct, no affectation. But he spoke \"as from a tripod,\" with such words as \"I know,\" \"Methinks,\" \"Why do ye,\" \"Ye should know. \" His sentences were short and compact, and his words car ried conviction with them and fitted the facts. His task , he declared, was no longer to seek and to question as he had don e in his youth, but to teach what he knew (i. 17). He did no t use the dialectic of the Socratic school, but would have hi s hearers turn from all else and give ear to the inner voice of ph ilosophy alone (iv. 2). He drew his illustrations from any chance occurrence or homely happening (iv. 3; vi. 3, 38), and pressed al l into service for the improvement of his listeners. When put on his trial, he would make no preparation for his defence. He had lived his life as it came from day to day, prepared for death, and would continue to do so (vi ii. 30). Moreover it was now his deliberate choice to challe nge death in"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 the cause of philosophy. And so to his old friend's repeated solicitations to prepare his defence, he replied: \"Damis, you seem to lose your wits in face p. 125 of death, though you have been so long with me and I have loved philosophy e’en from my youth; * I thought that you were both yourself prepared for death and knew full well my generalship in this. For just as warriors in the fi eld have need not only of good courage but also of that generalsh ip which tells them when to fight, so too must they who wisdom lov e make careful study of good times to die, that they may c hoose the best and not be done to death all unprepared. That I hav e chosen best and picked the moment which suits wisdom best to gi ve death battle—if so it be that any one should wish to slay me—I've proved to other friends when you were by, nor ever ceased to teach you it alone\" (vii. 31). The above are some few indications of how our philo sopher lived, in fear of nothing but disloyalty to his hig h ideal. We will now make mention of some of his more personal trait s, and of some of the names of his followers.

His manner was ever mild and gentle (i. 36; ii. 22) and modest (iv. 31; viii. 15), and in this, says Damis, he was more like an Indian than a Greek (iii . 36); yet occasionally he burst out indignantly against some special enormity (iv. 30). His mood was often pensive (i. 3 4), and when not speaking he would remain for long plunged in de ep thought, during which p. 127 his eyes were steadfastly fixed on the ground (i. 1 0 et al.). Though, as we have seen, he was inflexibly stern wi th himself, he was ever ready to make excuses for others; if, o n the one hand, he praised the courage of those few who remai ned with him at Rome, on the other he refused to blame for t heir cowardice the many who had fled (iv. 38). Nor was h is gentleness shown simply by abstention from blame, h e was ever active in positive deeds of compassion (cf. vi. 39) . One of his little peculiarities was a liking to be addressed as \"Tyanean\" (vii. 38), but why this was so we are not told. It can hardly have been that Apollonius was particularly p roud of his birth-place, for even though he was a great lover o f Greece, so that at times you would call him an enthusiastic pa triot, his love for other p. 128 countries was quite as pronounced. Apollonius was a citizen of the world, if there has ever been one, into whose s peech the word native-land did not enter, and a priest of uni versal religion in whose vocabulary the word sect did not exist."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 In spite of his extremely ascetic life he was a man of strong physique, so that even when he had reached the ripe age of four- score years, we are told, he was sound and healthy in every limb and organ, upright and perfectly formed. There was also a certain indefinite charm about him that made him mo re pleasant to look upon than even the freshness of youth, and this even though his face was furrowed with wrinkles, just as the statues in the temple at Tyana represented him in the time of Philostratus. In fact, says his rhetorical biograph er, report sang higher praises over the charm of Apollonius in his old age than over the beauty of Alcibiades in his youth (viii. 2 9). In brief, our philosopher seems to have been of a m ost charming presence and lovable disposition; nor was his absol ute devotion to philosophy of the nature of the hermit ideal, fo r he passed his life among men. What wonder then that he attracted to himself many followers and disciples! It would have been in teresting if Philostratus had told us more about these \"Apolloni ans,\" as they were called (viii. 21), and whether they p. 129 constituted a distinct school, or whether they were grouped together in communities on the Pythagorean model, o r whether they were simply independent students attracted to the most commanding personality of the times in the domain o f philosophy. It is, however, certain that many of th em wore the same dress as himself and followed his mode of life (iv. 39). Repeated mention is also made of their accompanying Apollonius on his travels (iv. 47; v. 21; viii. 19, 21, 24), sometimes as many as ten of them at the same time, but none of them were allowed to address others until they had fulfilled the vow of silence (v. 43). The most distinguished of his followers were Musoni us, who was considered the greatest philosopher of the time after the Tyanean, and who was the special victim of Nero's t yranny (iv. 44; v. 19; vii. 16), and Demetrius, \"who loved Apol lonius\" (iv."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 25, 42; v. 19; vi. 31; vii. 10; viii. 10). These na mes are well known to history; of names otherwise unknown are th e Egyptian Dioscorides, who was left behind owing to weak heal th on the long journey to Ethiopia (iv. 11, 38; v. 43), Menip pus, whom he had freed from an obsession (iv. 25, 38; v. 43), Ph ædimus (iv. 11), and Nilus, who joined him from Gymnosophists ( v. 10 sqq ., 28), and of course Damis, who would have us think t hat he p. 130 was always with him from the time of their meeting at Ninus. On the whole we are inclined to think that Apolloni us did not establish any fresh organisation; he made use of th ose already existing, and his disciples were those who were att racted to him personally by an overmastering affection which coul d only be satisfied by being continually near him. This much seems certain, that he trained no one to carry on his tas k; he came and went, helping and illuminating, but he handed on no tradition of a definite line, and founded no school to be contin ued by successors. Even to his ever faithful companion, wh en bidding him farewell for what he knew would be the last tim e for Damis on earth, he had no word to say about the work to w hich he had devoted his life, but which Damis had never underst ood. His last words were for Damis alone, for the man who had lov ed him, but who had never known him. It was a promise to co me to him if he needed help. \"Damis, whenever you think on hi gh matters in solitary meditation, you shall see me\" (viii. 28 ). We will next turn our attention to a consideration of some of the sayings ascribed to Apollonius and the speeches put into his mouth by Philostratus. The shorter sayings are in a ll probability authentically traditional, but the p. 131 speeches are for the most part manifestly the artis tic working-up of the rough notes of Damis. In fact, they are defi nitely declared"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 to be so; but they are none the less interesting on this account, and for two reasons. In the first place, they honestly avow their nature , and make no claim of inspiration; they are confessedly human do cuments which endeavour to give a literary dress to the tra ditional body of thought and endeavour which the life of the phil osopher built into the minds of his hearers. The method was commo n to antiquity, and the ancient compilers of certain oth er series of famous documents would have been struck with amazem ent had they been able to see how posterity would divinise their efforts and regard them as immediately inspired by the sour ce of all wisdom. In the second place, although we are not to suppose that we are reading the actual words of Apollonius, we are neve rtheless conscious of being in immediate contact with the in ner atmosphere of the best religious thought of the Gre ek mind, and have before our eyes the picture of a mystic and sp iritual fermentation which leavened all strata of society i n the first century of our era. Footnotes 126:* Rathgeber (G.) in his Grossgriechenland and Pythag oras (Gotha; 1866), a work of marvellous bibliographical industry, refers to three supposed portraits of Apollonius (p . 621). (i) In the Campidoglio Museum of the Vatican, Indicazione delle Sculture (Roma; 1840), p. 68, nos. 75, 76, 77; (ii) in the Musée Royal Bourbon, described by Michel B.

Q.) in the atlas o f his Iconographie Grecque (Paris; 1808), vol. i. plate 1 7, facing p. 68, gives the reproduction of a contorniate, or med al with a circular border, on one side of which is a head of Apollonius and the Latin legend APOLLONIVS TEANEVS. This also represents our philosopher with a beard and long ha ir; the head is crowned, and the upper part of the body covered with a tunic and the philosopher's cloak. The medal, however, is of very inferior workmanship, and the portrait is by no mea ns pleasing. Visconti in his letterpress devotes an angry and co ntemptuous paragraph to Apollonius, \"ce trop célèbre imposteur ,\" as he calls him, based on De Tillemont. FROM HIS SAYINGS AND SERMONS A POLLONIUS believed in prayer, but how differently from the vulgar. For him the idea that the Gods could be swa yed from the path of rigid justice by the entreaties of men, was a blasphemy; that the Gods could be made parties to our selfish hopes and fears was to our philosopher unthinkable. One thing alone he knew, that the Gods were the ministers of right and the rigid dispensers of just desert. The common belief, which has persisted to our own day, that God can be swayed fr om His purpose, that compacts could be made with Him or wi th His ministers, was entirely abhorrent to Apollonius. Be ings with whom such pacts could be made, who could be swayed and turned, were not Gods but less than men. And so we find Apollonius as a youth conversing with one of the pr iests of Æsculapius as follows: \"Since then the Gods know all things, I think that one who enters the temple with a p. 133 right conscience within him should pray thus: 'Give me, ye Gods, what is my due!'\" (i. 11)."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 And thus again on his long journey to India he pray ed at Babylon: \"God of the sun, send thou me o'er the ear th so far as e’er ’tis good for Thee and me; and may I come to k now the good, and never know the bad nor they know me\" (i. 31). One of his most general prayers, Damis tells us, wa s to this effect: \"Grant me, ye Gods, to have little and need naught\" (i. 34). \"When you enter the temples, for what do you pray?\" asked the Pontifex Maximus Telesinus of our philosopher. \"I p ray,\" said Apollonius, \"that righteousness may rule, the laws remain unbroken, the wise be poor and others rich, but hon estly\" (iv. 40). The belief of the philosopher in the grand ideal of having nothing and yet possessing all things, is exemplifi ed by his reply to the officer who asked him how he dared enter the dominions of Babylon without permission. \"The whole earth,\" s aid Apollonius, \"is mine; and it is given me to journey through it\" (i. 21). There are many instances of sums of money being off ered to Apollonius for his services, but he invariably refu sed them; not only so but his followers also refused all presents . On the occasion when King Vardan, with true Oriental p. 134 generosity, offered them gifts, they turned away; w hereupon Apollonius said: \"You see, my hands, though many, a re all like each other.\" And when the king asked Apollonius wha t present he would bring him back from India, our philosopher replied: \"A gift that will please you, sire. For if my stay there should make me wiser, I shall come back to you better than I am\" (i. 41). When they were crossing the great mountains into In dia a conversation is said to have taken place between Ap ollonius and"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 Damis, which presents us with a good instance of ho w our philosopher ever used the incidents of the day to i nculcate the higher lessons of life. The question was concerning the \"below\" and \"above.\" Yesterday, said Damis, we were below in the valley; to-day we are above , high on the mountains, not far distant from heaven. So this is what you mean by \"b elow\" and \"above,\" said Apollonius gently. Why, of course, im patiently retorted Damis, if I am in my right mind; what need of such useless questions? And have you acquired a greater knowledge of the divine nature by being nearer heaven on the tops of the mountains? continued his master. Do you think that those who observe the heaven from the mountain heights are an y nearer the understanding of things? Truth to p. 135 tell, replied Damis, somewhat crestfallen, I did think I should come down wiser, for I've been up a higher mountain than any of them, but I fear I know no more than before I as cended it. Nor do other men, replied Apollonius; \"such observa tions make them see the heavens more blue, the stars more larg e, and the sun rise from the night, things known to those who tend the sheep and goats; but how God doth take thought for human kind, and how He doth find pleasure in their servic e, and what is virtue, righteousness, and common-sense, that neith er Athos will reveal to those who scale his summit nor yet Olympu s who stirs the poet's wonder, unless it be the soul perceive t hem; for should the soul when pure and unalloyed essay such heights , I swear to thee, she wings her flight far far beyond this loft y Caucasus\" (ii. 6). So again, when at Thermopylæ his followers were dis puting as to which was the highest ground in Greece, Mt. Œta being then in view. They happened to be just at the foot of th e hill on which the Spartans fell overwhelmed with arrows. Climbing to the top of it Apollonius cried out: \"And I think this the highest ground, for those who fell here for freedom's sake have mad e it high as Œta and raised it far above a thousand of Olympuses \" (iv. 23)."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 Another instance of how Apollonius turned p. 136 chance happenings to good account is the following. Once at Ephesus, in one of the covered walks near the city, he was speaking of sharing our goods with others, and how we ought mutually to help one another. It chanced that a num ber of sparrows were sitting on a tree hard by in perfect silence. Suddenly another sparrow flew up and began chirping , as though it wanted to tell the others something. Wher eupon the little fellows all set to a-chirping also, and flew away after the new-comer. Apollonius’ superstitious audience were greatly struck by this conduct of the sparrows, and thought it was an augury of some important matter. But the philosophe r continued with his sermon. The sparrow, he said, has invited his friends to a banquet. A boy slipped down in a lane hard by and spilt some corn he was carrying in a bowl; he picked up most o f it and went away. The little sparrow, chancing on the scattered grains, immediately flew off to invite his friends to the f east. Thereon most of the crowd went off at a run to see if it were true, and when they came back shouting and all agog with wonderment, the philosopher continued: \"Ye see what care the sparrows take of one another, and how happy they ar e to share with all their goods. And yet we men do not approve ; nay, if we see a man p. 137 sharing his goods with other men, we call it wastef ulness, extravagance, and by such names, and dub the men to whom he gives a share, fawners and parasites. What then is left to us except to shut us up at home like fattening birds, and gorge our bellies in the dark until we burst with fat?\" (iv. 3). On another occasion, at Smyrna, Apollonius, seeing a ship getting under weigh, used the occasion for teaching the people the lesson of co-operation. \"Behold the vessel's cr ew!\" he said."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 100 \"How some have manned the boats, some raise the anc hors up and make them fast, some set the sails to catch the wind, how others yet again look out at bow and stern. But if a single man should fail to do a single one of these his duties, or bungle in his seamanship, their sailing will be bad, and they wil l have the storm among them. But if they strive in rivalry eac h with the other, their only strife being that no man shall se em worse than his mates, fair havens shall there be for such a sh ip, and all good weather and fair voyage crowd in upon it\" (iv. 9). Again, on another occasion, at Rhodes, Damis asked him if he thought anything greater than the famous Colossus. \"I do,\" replied Apollonius; \"the man who walks in wisdom's guileless paths that give us health\" (v. 21). p. 138 There is also a number of instances of witty or sar castic answers reported of our philosopher, and indeed, in spite o f his generally grave mood, he not unfrequently rallied his hearers , and sometimes, if we may say so, chaffed the foolishnes s out of them (see especially iv. 30). Even in times of great danger this characteristic s hows itself. A good instance is his answer to the dangerous questi on of Tigellinus, \"What think you of Nero?\" \"I think bett er of him than you do,\" retorted Apollonius, \"for you think h e ought to sing, and I think he ought to keep silence\" (iv. 44 ). So again his reproof to a young Croesus of the peri od is as witty as it is wise. \"Young sir,\" he said, \"methinks it i s not you who own your house, but your house you\" (v. 22). Of the same style also is his answer to a glutton w ho boasted of his gluttony. He copied Hercules, he said, who was as famous for the food he ate as for his labours."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 \"Yes,\" said Apollonius, \"for he was Hercules. But you , what virtue have you, midden-heap? Your only claim to no tice is your chance of being burst\" (iv. 23). But to turn to more serious occasions. In answer to Vespasian's earnest prayer, \"Teach me what should a good king d o,\" Apollonius is said to have replied somewhat in the following words: p. 139 \"You ask me what can not be taught. For kingship is the greatest thing within a mortal's reach; it is not taught. Ye t will I tell you what if you will do, you will do well. Count not th at wealth which is stored up—in what is this superior to the sand haphazard heaped? nor that which comes from men who groan beneath taxation's heavy weight—for gold that comes from tears is base and black. You'll use wealth best of any ki ng, if you supply the needs of those in want and make their we alth secure for those with many goods. Be fearful of the power to do whate’er you please, so will you use it with more p rudence. Do not lop off the ears of corn that show beyond the r est and raise their heads—for Aristotle is not just in this * —but rather weed their disaffection out like tares from corn, and sh ow yourself a fear to stirrers up of strife not in 'I punish you' but in 'I will do so.' Submit yourself to law, O prince, for you will make the laws with greater wisdom if you do not despise the law y ourself. Pay reverence more than ever to the Gods; great are the gifts you have received from them, and for great things you p ray. † In what concerns the state act as a king; in what conc erns yourself, act as p. 140 a private man\" (v. 36). And so on much in the same strain, all good advice and showing a deep knowledge of human a ffairs. And if we are to suppose that this is merely a rhet orical exercise of Philostratus and not based on the substance of w hat"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 Apollonius said, then we must have a higher opinion of the rhetorician than the rest of his writings warrant. There is an exceedingly interesting Socratic dialog ue between Thespesion, the abbot of the Gymnosophist community , and Apollonius on the comparative merits of the Greek a nd Egyptian ways of representing the Gods. It runs somewhat as follows: \"What! Are we to think,\" said Thespesion, \"that the Pheidiases and Praxiteleses went up to heaven and took impress ions of the forms of the Gods, and so made an art of them, or w as it something else that set them a-modelling?\" \"Yes, something else,\" said Apollonius, \"something pregnant with wisdom.\" \"What was that? Surely you cannot say it was anythi ng else but imitation?\" \"Imagination wrought them—a workman wiser far than imitation; for imitation only makes what it has see n, whereas imagination makes what it has never seen, conceivin g it with reference to the thing it really is.\" Imagination, says Apollonius, is one of the p. 141 most potent faculties, for it enables us to reach n earer to realities. It is generally supposed that Greek scul pture was merely a glorification of physical beauty, in itsel f quite unspiritual. It was an idealisation of form and fea tures, limbs and muscles, an empty glorification of the physical with nothing of course really corresponding to it in the nature of things. But Apollonius declared it brings us nearer to the real , as Pythagoras and Plato declared before him, and as all the wiser teach. He meant this literally, not vaguely and fantastically . He asserted that the types and ideas of things are the only rea lities. He meant that between the imperfection of the earth and the highest divine"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 type of all things, were grades of increasing perfe ction. He meant that within each man was a form of perfection , though of course not yet absolutely perfect. That the angel i n man, his dæmon, was of God-like beauty, the summation of all the finest features he had ever worn in his many lives on eart h. The Gods, too, belonged to the world of types, of models, of perfections, the heaven-world. The Greek sculptors had succeeded in getting in contact with this world, and the faculty they us ed was imagination. This idealisation of form was a worthy way to repre sent the Gods; but, says Apollonius, if p. 142 you set up a hawk or owl or dog in your temples, to represent Hermes or Athena or Apollo, you may dignify the ani mals, but you make the Gods lose dignity. To this Thespesion replies that the Egyptians dare not give any precise form to the Gods; they give them merely sym bols to which an occult meaning is attached. Yes, answers Apollonius, but the danger is that the common people worship these symbols and get unbeautiful id eas of the Gods. The best thing would be to have no representa tions at all. For the mind of the worshipper can form and fashion for himself an image of the object of his worship better than a ny art. Quite so, retorted Thespesion, and then added misch ievously: There was an old Athenian, by-the-by—no fool—called Socrates, who swore by the dog and goose as though they were Gods. Yes, replied Apollonius, he was no fool. He swore b y them not as being Gods, but in order that he might not swear by the Gods (iv. 19)."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 This is a pleasant passage of wit, of Egyptian agai nst Greek, but all such set arguments must be set down to the rhet orical exercises of Philostratus rather than to Apollonius , who taught as \"one having authority,\" as \"from a tripod.\" Apol lonius, a priest of universal religion, might have pointed ou t the good side and the p. 143 bad side of both Greek and Egyptian religious art, and certainly taught the higher way of symbolless worship, but he would not champion one popular cult against another. In the a bove speech there is a distinct prejudice against Egypt and a g lorification of Greece, and this occurs in a very marked fashion in several other speeches. Philostratus was a champion of Greece aga inst all comers; but Apollonius, we believe, was wiser than his biographer. In spite of the artificial literary dress that is g iven to the longer discourses of Apollonius, they contain many noble t houghts, as we may see from the following quotations from the conversations of our philosopher with his friend De metrius, who was endeavouring to dissuade him from braving Domit ian at Rome. The law, said Apollonius, obliges us to die for lib erty, and nature ordains that we should die for our parents, our friends, or our children. All men are bound by these duties. Bu t a higher duty is laid upon the sage; he must die for his pri nciples and the truth he holds dearer than life. It is not the law that lays this choice upon him, it is not nature; it is the streng th and courage of his own soul. Though fire or sword threaten him, it will not overcome his resolution or force from him the sligh test falsehood; but he will guard the secrets of others’ lives and all that p. 144"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 has been entrusted to his honour as religiously as the secrets of initiation.

In the above we have the true philosopher's contemp t for death, and also the calm knowledge of the initiate, of the comforter and adviser of others to whom the secrets of their live s have been confessed, that no tortures can ever unseal his lip s. Here, too, we have the full knowledge of what consciousness is, o f the impossibility of hiding the smallest trace of evil in the inner world; and also the dazzling brilliancy of a higher ethic which makes the habitual conduct of the crowd appear surp rising—the \"that which they do—not with shame.\" Footnotes 139:* See Chassang, op. cit., p. 458, for a criticism on this statement. 139:† This was before Vespasian became emperor.

It is evident that Philostratus had access to lette rs attributed to Apollonius, for he quotes a number of them, † and there seems no reason to doubt their authenticity.

Here is one to the magistrates of Sparta: “Apollonius to the Ephors, greeting! “It is possible for men not to make mistakes, but i t requires noble men to acknowledge they have made them.” All of which Apollonius gets into just half as many words in Greek. Here, again, is an interchange of notes betw een the two greatest philosophers of the time, both of whom suf fered imprisonment and were in constant danger of death. “Apollonius to Musonius, the philosopher, greeting! “I want to go to you, to share speech and roof with you, to be of some service to you.

And if the healing art is most divine, it must occu py itself with the soul as well as with the body; for no creature can be sound so long as the higher part in it is sickly.\" Writing to the priests of Delphi against the practi ce of blood- sacrifice, he says: 27. \"Heraclitus was a sage, but even he † never advised the people of Ephesus to wash out mud with mud.\" ‡ p. 149 Again, to some who claimed to be his followers, tho se \"who think themselves wise,\" he writes the reproof: 43. \"If any say he is my disciple, then let him add he keeps himself apart out of the Baths, he slays no living thing, eats of no flesh, is free from envy, malice, hatred, calumn y, and hostile feelings, but has his name inscribed among the race of those who’ve won their freedom.\" Among these letters is found one of some length add ressed to Valerius, probably P. Valerius Asiaticus, consul in A . D . 70. It is a wise letter of philosophic consolation to enable Valerius to bear the loss of his son, and runs as follows: * \"There is no death of anyone, but only in appearanc e, even as there is no birth of any, save only in seeming. The change from being to becoming seems to be birth, and the change from becoming to being seems to be death, but in reality no one is ever born, nor does one ever die. It is simply a be ing visible and then invisible; the former through the density of m atter, and the latter because of the subtlety of being—being which is ever the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 109 same, its only change being motion and rest. For be ing has this necessary p. 150 peculiarity, that its change is brought about by no thing external to itself; but whole becomes parts and parts become whole in the oneness of the all. And if it be asked: What is thi s which sometimes is seen and sometimes not seen, now in th e same, now in the different?—it might be answered: It is t he way of everything here in the world below that when it is filled out with matter it is visible, owing to the resistance of it s density, but is invisible, owing to its subtlety, when it is rid of matter, though matter still surround it and flow through it in tha t immensity of space which hems it in but knows no birth or death. \"But why has this false notion [of birth and death] remained so long without a refutation? Some think that what has happened through them, they have themselves brought about. T hey are ignorant that the individual is brought to birth through parents, not by parents, just as a thing produced through the earth is not produced from it. The change which comes to the individual is nothing that is caused by his visible surroundings, but rather a change in the one thing which is in every individua l. \"And what other name can we give to it but primal b eing? ’Tis it alone that acts and suffers becoming all for all th rough all, eternal deity, deprived and wronged of its own self by names and forms. But this is a less serious thing than p. 151 that a man should be bewailed, when he has passed f rom man to God by change of state and not by the destruction o f his nature. The fact is that so far from mourning death you oug ht to honour it and reverence it. The best and fittest way for y ou to honour death is now to leave the one who's gone to God, an d set to work to play the ruler over those left in your char ge as you were wont to do. It would be a disgrace for such a man a s you to owe"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 your cure to time and not to reason, for time makes even common people cease from grief. The greatest thing is a strong rule, and of the greatest rulers he is best who fir st can rule himself. And how is it permissible to wish to chang e what has been brought to pass by will of God? If there's a l aw in things, and there is one, and it is God who has appointed i t, the righteous man will have no wish to try to change go od things, for such a wish is selfishness, and counter to the law, but he will think that all that comes to pass is a good thing. On! heal yourself, give justice to the wretched and console them; so shall you dry your tears. You should not set your private woes above your public cares, but rather set your public cares before your private woes. And see as well what consolation you already have! The nation sorrows with you for your son. Mak e some return to those who weep with you; and this p. 152 you will more quickly do if you will cease from tea rs than if you still persist. Have you not friends? Why! you have yet another son. Have you not even still the one that's gone? Y ou have!— will answer anyone who really thinks. For 'that whi ch is' doth cease not—nay is just for the very fact that it wil l be for aye; or else the 'is not' is, and how could that be when th e 'is' doth never cease to be? \"Again it will be said you fail in piety to God and are unjust. ’Tis true. You fail in piety to God, you fail in ju stice to your boy; nay more, you fail in piety to him as well. Wo uld’st know what death is?
