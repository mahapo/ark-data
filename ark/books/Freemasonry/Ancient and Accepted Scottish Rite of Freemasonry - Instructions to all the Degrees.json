If the Wardens are the least ancient, thei r places shall be filled by those most ancient in degrees, whom the T.: P.: Grand Master shall name; and the same rule is to be observed with the other officers.

If a brother is a prey to misfortune, it is the dut y of every brother to endeavour to alleviate his unhappy situation. It is the duty of the Hospitable Brother to visit a ll sick brethren, and see that they are well attended to. If any brother is taken sick, and it s hall come to the knowledge of any member, he shall give early advice of it to the Hospitable Bro ther and to the Lodge, that the necessary succour may be administered.

The King of Israel selected seven of the most worth y and expert brethren, Master Masons, and appointed them special guardians of the Sanctum San ctorum, and of the sacred furniture of that most Holy Place. They were called Secret Masters, a nd as in due time they were advanced to higher grades, and thus vacancies were created, oth ers were selected to fill their places. But one guard was on duty at a time, yet seven were selecte d, and this is termed the mysterious number of this degree, it having many allusions, to the se ven cardinal virtues; to happiness, to which our brethren thought there were seven degrees; to the s even stages of life; to the seven laws or principles of Noah, given for the government of his posterity; and to the seven days of the week the last having been set apart for the great teachi ng of this degree, Secrecy and Silence. This degree forms a beautiful introduction to the Ineffa ble series. SECRET MASTER In the grey dawn of morning, even before the sun ri sing over Mount Olivet flushed with crimson the walls of the Temple, the chosen few, awe-strick en and grave, had assembled. The light from the seven-branch candlestick in the East was reflec ted back from the golden floor, from the brazen laver of water, with hyssop and napkins, but fell sombrely on the heavy drapings of the sack-cloth on the walls. Amidst the prayers and exh ortations, and the solemn chanting of the Levites, the seven entered into a mystic bond, and the duty of secrecy and silence was laid upon them. And then the doors of cedar and olivewood hea vily carved and gilded were opened, the Page 5 of 242"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"veils of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and richly embroidered white linen were drawn aside, and the mysteries of the Holy of Holies revealed to the m. None but the Priests and Levites had entered the Sa nctum Sanctorum since the Sacred Ark had been brought thither, and now as the Seven Secret S entinels put off their shoes and washed their feet, and stepped over the golden threshold, they s tood in silence blinded with the light that burst upon them. The spreading wings of the Cherubim cove red the Ark of the Covenant, but from all sides the walls glittered with gold and precious st ones. THE LODGE AND ITS DECORATIONS The Lodge of Secret Masters represents the Holy Pla ce or Sanctuary of the Temple; is hung in black, strewed with white tears, and contains the b razen salver of pure water, with napkins and bunch of hyssop, the seven-branch candlestick, whic h is burning in the East, and which is the only light in the Lodge.

The furniture is also draped in black. The altar of perfumes, which is in the Southeast co rner of the Sanctuary, during a Reception is burning No working-tools are used in this Lodge, for the re ason that the labours on the Temple were suspended after the death of Hiram the Builder.

In the Ineffable degrees, every lesson taught is co nnected, directly or indirectly with our dearest interest in this or in a future world. The whole sy stem tends to promote the glory of God and the good of mankind. In the symbolic degrees these thin gs are taught generally; in the Ineffable and Sublime degrees, in detail. Genuine Freemasonry, my brother, is a system of mor als, and approaches religion: in fact, such was primitive Freemasonry. Ineffable Freemasonry is practised with an eye single to the improvement of our morals, and a reference to those sublime truths which constituted its principal essence in the earlier ages of the world. It rises above all human institutions, and forms a beautiful auxiliary to the practice of religion. In no place, except in God's Holy Word, are the moral and social virtues enforced by such awful sanctions and decrees. The degrees upon which you are now entering, are ca lled Ineffable, because they treat of the Ineffable name of the Great Jehovah, and of his Ine ffable essence. Page 11 of 242"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"O Jehovah! our Adonai, how excellent is Thy name ov er all the earth! Thy name declares the glory of Elohim. There appears to be power in the n ame which revealeth secrets. Freemasonry is an art of great compass and extent. A knowledge of its mysteries is not attained at once, but by degrees. Each degree in Ineffable M asonry is intended to inculcate a moral lesson and the practice of some particular virtue. Advance s are made only by much instruction and assiduous application. Each step is progressive, an d opens new light and information. According to the progress we make, we limit or extend our inq uiries; and in proportion to our capacities, we attain a greater or lesser degree of perfection. Freemasonry is an allegorical system. Every doctrin e and ceremony has its mystical reference, which is not always apparent at the first blush; so that where the uninformed and weak find only mystery, the true initiate and thoughtful, possess food for the employment of the noblest faculties. The true Mason will not rest satisfied with mere ce remonies, which in themselves are cold and heartless, but will study to comprehend their mysti cal signification. We, as Ineffable Masons, retain and continue to practise these signs and sym bols, because we believe they work closer into our hearts than mere words. Permit me now, my brother, to receive you as a Secr et Master, and give you rank among the Levites. The laurel, an emblem of victory, is to remind you of the conquest you ought to gain over your passions; the olive, a symbol of peace, which shoul d over reign among us. With Wisdom, Strength, Prudence, and Fortitude, may you soon obt ain the favour of an entrance into the secret vault. It will be your own fault if you are not fou nd worthy, and do not in due time arrive at the sacred place, where, wrapped in divine joy, you may contemplate the pillar of Beauty. By the rank you now hold among the Levites in the q uality of Secret Master, you have become one of the guardians of the Sanctum Sanctorum, and I place you in the number of seven. The eye upon your apron is to remind you to keep a watchful eye upon the sacred treasures you are set apart to guard, and over the moral conduct of the Craft in general. Remember, too, that the eye of the Lord is on them that fear him. Brother Adoniram, it is our order that you cause to be erected a tomb or obelisk, of white and black marble, west-southwest of the Temple, wherein shall be deposited the embalmed remains of our lamented Grand Master Hiram Abif. The white marble shall denote the innocence and purity of our departed Grand Master, and the black the untimely death of him we mourn. See, therefore, that the solemn duty is speedily ex ecuted, and let the obsequies be performed with becoming and imposing ceremonies. Freemasonry is of heavenly birth the pillars of Wis dom and Strength support it; its foundation- stone is Virtue; its cement, Charity. Like a rock i n the midst of the ocean, it rises above every storm, and bids proud defiance to the raging waves which dash against its base. Freemasonry, in its theoretic and speculative sense , is an acknowledged moral order founded on Charity, the handmaid of Religion, and having for i ts object the inculcation of divine truths and moral teachings through symbolism.

This ceremony was orginially established to commemo rate the death of our Grand Master Hiram Abif, whose labours at the building of the first Te mple, and whose tragical. death, furnish so much of the mystical knowledge of Ancient Craft Masonry. It is retained by us that it may be improved as a lesson both useful and instructive.

Traditional History First Version Solomon, having been informed that the body of Hira in Abif was found and already deposited on the outside of the temple, towards the north, near to a well, in which his Jewel had been found, was happy to have the poor consolation of finding t he precious remains of so great a man. He Page 18 of 242"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"gave orders and strict charge to his Grand Inspecto r, the noble Adoniram, that the funeral obsequies should be as pompous and magnificent as f or the king himself. He likewise ordered that all the brethren should attend it with white a prons and gloves and strictly forbad that the bloody stains should be washed away, until he had w reaked his vengeance on the perpetrators of the horrid deed. The noble Adoniram chief of the wo rks of the temple, soon finished a plan for a beautiful monument, which was erected and finished in nine days. It was made of black and white marble. The heart of Hiram Abif was enclosed in an urn, and exposed for nine days on the three steps of the sanctum sanctorum, previous to the fin ishing of the temple, and then placed on the top of a beautiful obelisk, which was built on the side of the temple, at the west door, a little to t he north, in order to mark out the place where the mur derers had first deposited him in a pit, before they removed him to the place where Stolkin found h im under the sprig of Cassia. The heart of the excellent Hiram Abif was then exposed to public view in the urn with a sword run through it. The brethren came to express their grief on the occ asion, kneeling on the first step which led to the sanctum sanctorum. At the expiration of nine da ys, the heart was deposited on the obelisk, and covered with a triangular stone, on which was e ngraved, in Hebrew, the characters I. M. R The I is the initial letter of the ancient master's word, and M. B. are initials of the new word. A sprig of Cassia was entraved over the I. After this, Solomon had all the triangular medals t aken from the Masters, and the Master's word changed to that now given in the third degree. The body of the respectable Hiram Abif was buried in middle of the great chamber, separated from the temple, with all the honours due to so great a man. It was in this chamber that Solomon used to ho ld his chapter, and confer with Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, on the sacred mysteries. Thr ee days after the ceremonies were over, Solomon, surrounded by all his court, went to the T emple, and all the workmen were placed in the same order as on the day of the funeral. The king o ffered up a prayer to the Almighty, then examined the tomb, the canopy, the repeated triangl e, and the letters which were engraved thereon. He also examined the pyramid, and finding everything perfectly executed, he cried, in ecstasy. CONSUMMATUM EST. All the brethren answered with the sign of admiration, and said, Amen, amen, amen. Traditional History Second Version G.: O.: Some time after the death of our Grand Mast er Hiram Abiff, King Solomon was informed that the body was found. The perpetrators of the horrid deed were not at thi s time discovered, and it was not certain but that they might have the hardihood and effrontery t o mingle with the brethren, and seem to join in the general grief, in order to better conceal their guilt and prevent suspicion. In order to ascertain the truth of the matter, King Solomon caused a gene ral muster of all the workmen to be made. Happy to have the poor consciousness of having found the precious remains of so great and so good a man as Hiram Abif, and having an opportunity of paying a just tribute of respect to his memory, he ordered the noble Adoniram, his Grand Inspector, to make suitable arrangements for his interme nt. The brethren were directed to attend with white gloves and aprons, and h e forbade the marks of blood which had been spilled in the Temple to be effa ced until the traitors should be discovered and punished. In the meanwhile, he directed the noble Adoniram to furnish a plan for a superb tomb or obelisk, of white and black marble, which plan was accepted and the work finished. Three days after the funeral ceremonies had been pe rformed, King Solomon repaired with his Court to the Temple, and all the brethren being arr anged as at the funeral, he proceeded with his Page 19 of 242"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"brethren to see and examine the tomb and obelisk, w ith the inscription there on.

What could Solomon mean by establishing this deg ree ? A. He did it in honour of Hiram Abif, in order to i mprint on the minds of the people an unaffeeted love and respect for his memory, and to incite in t hem a desire to find out his murderers ; for, at this time, it was not known of the murderers' audac iousness to mix themselves with the brethren, and to partake in the general expressions of conste rnation and grief in order to conceal their guilt, and prevent suspicion. Solomon, to ascertain this o rdered a general muster of all the workmen, and found that they all answered to their names exc epting the ruffians who had run away. He therefore ordered the noble Adoniram to build an el egant monument for him, at the westsouth- west part of the temple, that there the body should be privately interred, and no brother admitted to the knowledge it, who was not a secret master. T he body was also privately embalmed and some time after removed to another apartment separa ted from the temple, where the King held the chapter. The heart of that great man, after being exposed ni ne days, on the third step of sanctum sanctorum, and having received the homage of the br ethren who knelt on the first step, was then deposited in the urn, and fixed on the top of the o belisk, with a sword pierced through it, implying that such an atrocious deed had cried aloud for pub lic vengeance.

What was the name of the Master of the Masters? A. His name was Mahabone or Macbenach, a very virtu ous man, held in the highest esteem by Solomon and one of the first intendants of the buil ding. He was also the intimate friend of Hiram. Abif, which induced Solomon to send him in search o f the body of his deceased friend, when every former attempt to find it had proved ineffect ual. Solomon ordered him to go, and requested three things of him ? First, that he should bring b ack that respectable man's jewel ; second, that he should bring with him that ever-to-be-lamented m an, dead or alive; and third, that he should discover the perpetrators of that horrid deed. Q. Did Macbenach comply with these three orders ? A. With fifteen others, who were chosen to attend h im on this search, he first went to the Temple, where, seeing the blood that had been spilt in many parts, he traced it to a well in the north part of the Temple, whence he concluded, that Hiram Abif ha d been killed and thrown into this well. Thus prompted, and further encouraged by a luminous mete or which stood over the well, he determined to have it drawn dry. This being done, h e went down into it, found not the body, but the Master's jewel. It appears, that Hiram Abif, wh en attacked by the ruffians, must have plucked off this jewel, and thrown it into the well near th e great staircase, rather than it should fall into the hands of such villains. Macbenach blessed heaven, a nd jointly with his companions, offered up a prayer of thanksgiving for their signal success. Af ter this they went on, in order to comply with the other part of their instructions. They had the mete or still for their guide, when they stopped it a small hill between Lydria, and Joppa, to rest awhil e, and then it was that Brother Stolkin found the body of the respectable Hiram Abif, as is related i n the third degree.

The life of the supposed spy was deman ded, but saved by the intercession of King Solomon, and his zeal and trustworthiness, upon exa mination, rewarded by his becoming the witness to a new compact.

Ritual Form of the Lodge This lodge is lighted with twenty-seven lamps, in t hree branches, nine in each, and placed, as in the third degree, east, west, and south, hung with black, and strewed with tears. At a reception, there are only two brethren in this lodge, who represent Solomon, King of Israel, and Hiram, King of Tyre. They are dressed in blue r obes, lined with ermine, with crowns on their heads, and sceptres in their hands. A table stands between them, on which are placed two swords, a cross, and a roll of parchment. The breth ren in this lodge are called Perfect Masters, wear white aprons, lined, bordered, and trimmed wit h fiery red, a collar of the same to hang round their necks, with a plain triangle painted on the f lap of the apron, and white gloves bordered with red. The room in which this lodge is held represents the Hall of Audience for Masons. It is opened and closed by twenty-seven knocks of a hammer, nine str okes at short intervals, and an interval between the eighth and ninth. Form of Opening Solomon strikes his twenty-seven, and Hiram does th e same. The brethren present bend their right knees, cross their hands, and raise them so that their thumbs touch their forehead. Then, altogether, they repeat the word Jova in a low voice. They then draw their swords and retire; Solomon having a ppointed them guards, with a captain and lieutenant, whose business it is to see that the ot hers behave themselves with decency, to keep the lodge well tiled, and to drive away brethren wh o would, come near it: thus there remain in the lodge only the two kings. Form of Reception The candidate being in the anti-chamber, the Captai n of the Guards orders one of the men to take away his hat, sword, gloves, apron, and jewel of a Perfect Master. He is then placed at the lodge-door, which is purposely left on the jar, tha t he may peep in at the two kings. When he is well fixed, the Guards make a noise, which being he ard by Hiram, he looks about, and seeing a man peeping, throws up his hands and cries in a rag e: O heavens! We are overheard ! Solomon says, That cannot be, as my guards are at the door. Hiram, without reply, runs to the door, seizes the listener by the hands, and drags him into Solom on's presence, and says, Here, see then! Solomon asks what shall be done with him. Hiram say s we must put him to death, and puts his hand on his sword. Solomon quits his place, runs to Hiram, lays his ha nd upon the sword, and says: Stop, my brother. He then strikes hard on the table, on whic h the Captain and his Guards enter and salute the kings, by drawing their right hands from their left shoulder to their right hip. Solomon says to them: take away this guilty man, and let him be for thcoming when wanted: your lives must answer for him. (They depart with the prisoner.) Page 27 of 242"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Solomon and Hiram remain alone for some time, as if in contemplation, and talking very low. Solomon strikes the table loudly, when the Captain and his guards enter, leading the candidate, and remain with him in the west, till by a sign giv en by Solomon, they bring him before the throne. The brethren then take their places, and Solomon th us addresses the candidate: By my treaties and solicitations, I have so for pre vailed on my ally, the King of Tyre, whom you by your curiosity, had so offended, as to oblige him t o pronounce a sentence of death upon you ; I have so far prevailed on him, as not only to procur e his pardon for your offence, but have even obtained his consent to receive you as an Intimate Secretary to the articles of our new alliance. Do you think that you can inviolably keep secret wh at we are about to communicate to you, and will you bind yourself to do it by an inviolable ob ligation? Answer. I do and will. The penalty of this obligation is to have the body opened, entrails plucked out, heart torn to pieces and the whole thrown to the wild beasts of t he forests, guaranteed by three amens. Solomon then shows the draft of the lodge to the ca ndidate. and thus explains it to him. The window represented in the clouds is, in emblem of t he dome of the Temple In the glass of it is the letter J, which is the initial of the name of the G rand Architect of the Universe, Jova . The building at a distance represents Solomon's Palace, with the door and great gate to go in by the mausoleum. The tears marked out represent the mason 's audience chamber, hung with black, where Solomon used to shut himself up, when he coul d spare a minute from business, to lament the unhappy fate of Hiram Abif. It was in this cham ber, that Hiram, King of Tyre, found him in a deep meditation, when he came to visit him. The let ter A signifies alliance ; the first P to the fight , of the mausoleum promise; the other to the left per fection. Solomon orders the candidate to advance, and says t o him, I receive you as Intimate Secretary, on the condition that you will as faithfully fulfil your duty, and be as much attached to this order, as the person was whom you are about to succeed in office. The colour of the ribbon with which I now decorate you must ever bring to your memory the wounds which that great man received from the traitors who so inhumanly murdered him; an d, likewise, of the blood which he rather chose to spill than to reveal the secrets with whic h I am about to entrust you. We expect, my brother, that your fidelity will be proof against a ll temptations and dangers; and that the sword which I give you will serve to protect you against any villains who shall dare attempt to surprise you into a confession of our mysteries. The first sign is to draw your right hand from your left shoulder to your right hip, as the penalty of your obligation. The second sign is to raise both your hands, cross them, and let them fall by your sword, at the same time lifting up your eyes to heaven. The grip is to take each other's right hand, in the usual manner of saluting. Traditional History First Version You will now go to the Grand Orator and learn the h istory of this degree. G.: O.: Solomon, in consequence of the treaty estab lished between his ambassadors and Hiram, King of Tyre, solemnly covenanted to furnish a cert ain number of measures of oil, honey, and wheat, besides the grant of twenty cities, in lieu of the timbers hewn in the forest of Libanus for the building of the Temple, as well as for the ston e hewn in the quarries of Tyre. King Hiram went Page 28 of 242"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"to see the cities so assigned to him, and had the m ortification to find them a barren and sandy soil, almost depopulated, and the inhabitants of a rude and uncultivated class, the cities greatly fallen to decay, and that the province in that cond ition was likely to be a burden rather than an advantage to his treasury. He determined to go in person to Jerusalem and expo stulate with Solomon on his breaking the spirit of his promise; while, in truth, it was the intention of King Solomon, before putting the King of Tyre in possession, to rebuild and adorn the cit ies, and to change the inhospitable land into cultivated gardens, fields, and meadows. Arriving at Jerusalem, King Hiram entered the palac e, and, without waiting to be announced, went through the court and angrily passed the guard into the audience-chamber, where he found King Solomon alone, mourning over the death of Hiram Abi f. Joabert, the favourite of King Solomon, newly appoi nted Lieutenant of the Guards - all composed of Perfect Masters - seeing King Hiram enter in suc h excitement and rage, and not knowing him personally, feared that he intended some violence, and approached the door of the audience- chamber, to be ready to rush in and defend his mast er if there should be occasion. His zeal and devotion causing him to neglect the precaution whic h merely curiosity would have observed, he was seen by King Hiram, seized upon by him and drag ged into the hall, where he would have been at once slain by the enraged king but for the interference of his own sovereign, who immediately called the guard and ordered them to se ize the guilty man and be answerable for his appearance when wanted. The guards being sent away, King Solomon explained to Hiram that he had intended to rebuild the twenty cities and to furnish the fields with hu sbandmen before giving them to him: he also assured the king that, of all the favourites and lo rds of his court, Joabert had always evinced the warmest attachment to his person, and he knew him s ufficiently well to be convinced that the indiscretion he had been guilty of was not attribut able to the desire to gratify any idle curiosity, b ut to watch over his safety and interests. He therefor e entreated the king to withhold the sentence he had determined to pronounce against him. The King of Tyre, knowing how gratifying it would b e to King Solomon that his favourite should be pardoned, and convinced by the statement of the Cap tain of the Guard, readily assented, and the two kings renewed their alliance, which was to be p erpetual, with mutual promises of fidelity; to which treaty Joabert was selected as the witness or Confidential Secretary - which position had theretofore been filled by the lamented Hiram In this you are taught to be zealous and faithful t o be disinterested and benevolent - to act the peacemaker in case of dissensions, disputes, and qu arrels among your brethren and to beware of eaves-dropping. Traditional History Second Version Solomon, in consequence of the treaty established b etween him and the ambassadors of Hiram, King of Tyre, solemnly covenanted to furnish Hiram with a certain number of measures of oil, honey, and wheat, and a grant of province consistin g of thirty governments, in exchange for timber, hewn formed, and drawn from the Forest of L ebanon, by King Hiram's people, and hewn stones to be formed in the quarries of Tyre, and fi tted for immediate use. This treaty was to have been fulfilled as the Templ e should be finished. But Solomon allowed a year to elapse, without paying any regard to its fu lfilment: during which, Hiram visited the province, and had the mortification to find it a ba rren and sandy soil, inhabited by an uncultivated people, so that its possession was rather likely to be a burden than a benefit. Not hearing from Page 29 of 242"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Solomon, he determined to go in person to Jerusalem , to expostulate with him for having neglected to comply with the terms of the treaty. On his arrival, he entered the palace, went through the guard room, where, Solomon's court was assembled, and rushed directly into the king's apar tment, who happened to be alone, bemoaning the loss of Hiram Abif. Hiram walked so hastily, an d seemingly in so passionate a manner, as to raise the suspicion of Joabert, one of Solomon's fa vourites. Struck with a notion that Hiram had some evil design on Solomon, Joabert followed to th e door to listen, and was discovered there by Hiram, who exclaimed : - \"O heavens ! We are discov ered !' And running to the door, seized Joabert by the hand and dragged him into Solomon's presence, saying, Here he is ! Solomon, who could not doubt the trespass, said, what shall we do with this criminal ? Hiram replied, we must kill him, and drew his sword for that purpose on which Solomon, rushing from his throne, cried, My Brother, and suspend your wrath awhile. H e gave a knock on the table, on which the guards came in. Solomon said to them, Seize that gu ilty man, and be answerable for his appearance when requested. The guards retired with the prisoner, and Solomon t hus addressed Hiram. This Sir, is the only person among my favourites, and the lords my court, who has zeal and an affectionate attachment to my person. I know him sufficiently to be convinced that his indiscretion is less to be attributed to an imprudent curiosity than to his ap prehensions for my safety. Your looks, change of countenance and hasty manner in passing through the guard room, were the causes that exited his curiosity and alarm for my person. I the refore, entreat of you to recall the sentence of death, which you have pronounced against him, and I will be answerable for his zeal and discretions. Hiram seeing how agreeable it would be to Solomon t hat his favourite should be pardoned, readily consented, and the two renewed their treaty , which was to be perpetual with different claims, and promises on both sides of lasting frien dship to which Joabert was Intimate Secretary.

Ye shall not fear the face of man, for the judgement is God's S.: W.: Thou shalt provide out of all the people ab le men, such as fear God: men of truth and haters of injustice, and set them to judge the peop le at all seasons. J.: W.: Open thy mouth and judge righteously, for h e that followeth after righteousness and mercy, findeth life, happiness, and honour T.: I.: Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between man and man, and between the citizen and the stranger. Ye shall not respect persons in judgement, but shall listen to the humble as well as to the great. S.: W.: See that ye judge not falsely, nor slay the Innocent and the righteous; and take no gift, for a gift blindeth the wise and perverteth the words o f the righteous. Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall see the Lord. J.: W.: You shall have one manner of law, as well f or the stranger as for one of your own country. One ordinance shall be for you and the stranger tha t sojourneth with you: one law and one custom shall be adjudged for all. T.: I.: Love justice, you that are the judges of th e earth. Justice is perpetual and immortal. Oppress not the poor just man, but spare the widow, and honour the ancient gray hairs of the aged. Let not your strength be the law of justice, nor hold that which is feeble to be nothing worth. Let justice be ever meted out by you; yet let it be tempered with mercy, for as ye judge, so shall ye be judged. My brother, it is your desire to become a Provost a nd Judge. Are you aware that he, who would assume that character and would judge and decide be tween his brethren, must himself be a just and upright man-impartial, cautious, merciful-of pu re morals and blameless life and conversation- and that he must, first of all, give judgement agai nst his own faults?

What was the intention of King Solomon in formin g this degree ? A. To appoint grand superintendents over the archit ects to carry into execution the plans of Hirain Abiff in the outer works of the Temple, and to hono ur the great servant of the most high lord, who was, for that purpose, created Prince of Harodim, a nd Jerusalem, set above the great and Page 36 of 242"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"learned King of Tyre, and the most powerful king th en on earth, whose wisdom far exceeded that of all men.

Zadok, the great favourite of King Solomon, and to him, was entrusted the four keys of the sacred treasures contained in the oracle, above it in the obelisk of lliram Abif, and below it in the sacred private arch of Solomon. Q. In what manner did Zadok obtain admission into t he Sacred places? A. Into the obelisk he had free access without atte ndance. Into the sanctum sanctoram, or holy of holies, only with permission and in the presence of Tito Zadok, the High Priest who opened with the second key of the door the holy place leading t o the sanctum sanctorum, and having the glorious veil of the temple, which separated the ho ly place from the most holy sanctum sanetorum, thrown aside by twelve of the priesthood , representing the twelve tribes of Israel, he was permitted, during the reading of the law by the Senior Priest of the tribes of Israel, to view that glorious treasure exhibited in due form by the High Priest.

It is said that King Solomon, after the dea th of the Grand Master Hiram, in order that justice might be administered among the workmen upo n the Temple, their complaints heard and their disputes be decided, appointed seven Provosts and Judges to adjust their demands, listen to their complaints, and settle any disputes and di fferences that might arise among them. He appointed Tito, Prince Of Herodim, to be the chief Provost and Judge, Adoniram, and Abda, his father, and four others lea rned in the law of Moses, to complete the number and constitute the Tribunal. They held their sittings in the middle chamber of the Temple, where the records of the Tribunal were kept, in a b ox of ebony, studded with precious gems, the key of which was committed to the Provosts or Judge s; and there they considered and adjusted the demands and differences of the workmen, and det ermined all appeals from the judgement of a single Provost and Judge administering the same l aws to the Phoenician as to the Hebrew, and endeavouring to do entire justice, according to the law of Moses, between man and man. The necessity for a Court of Judges did not exist u ntil after the death of the Grand Master Hiram, as the number of difficulties and dissensions among the workmen was not so numerous, and judgement was arrived at by the ready decisions of Hiram, which all quietly acquiesced in. As a Provost and Judge, it is your especial duty to render justice to all, to hear patiently, remember accurately, and weigh carefully the facts and the arguments offered. In our intercourse with others, there are two kinds of injustice: the first, of those who offer an injury; the second, of those who have it in their power to avert an injury from those to whom it is offered, and yet do it not. So active injustice may be done in two ways-by force and by fraud. Respect not persons in judgement, but listen to the humble as well as to the great. Fear God, for judgement is God's. While you would administer justice, show mercy. Exh ibit the subduing influences of pity, the might of love, the control of mildness, the commanding ma jesty of that perfect character which mingles grave displeasure with grief and pity for the offen der. So brother Masons should treat their fellow Masons who go astray - not with bitterness, nor yet with good-natured easiness nor worldly indifference. The human heart bows not willingly to what is infir m or wrong in our nature. If it yields to us, it rather yields to what is divine in us. The wickedne ss of my neighbour will not submit to my wicked. ness Therefore deal faithfully but patientl y and tenderly, with evil. Remember that it becomes not frail and sinful human ity to be vindictive towards even the worst of criminals. Perhaps we owe it solely to a kind Provi dence having kept from us those temptations, under which we, too, like them, would have fallen. Finally, as a true Mason and Judge, always remember the injunction: \" Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mi ghty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.\" Beware of injury to your neighbour. If you have wro nged another, you may grieve, repent, and resolutely determine against any such weakness in f uture; you may, so far as it is possible, make reparation. This is well. The injured party may for give you, according to the meaning of human language, but the deed is done, and all the powers of Nature, were they to conspire in your behalf, could not make it undone; the consequences to the body, the consequences to the soul, though no man may perceive them, are there-are writ ten in the annals of the past, and must reverberate throughout all time. Page 38 of 242"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Repentance for a wrong done, bears, like every othe r act, its own fruit-the fruit of purifying the heart and amending the future; but not of effacing the past. Even the pulsations of the air, once set in motion by the human voice, cease not to exist with the sounds to which they gave rise; their quickly atten uated force soon becomes inaudible to human ears. But the waves of air thus raised perambulate the surface of earth and ocean; and in less than twenty hours every atom of its atmosphere take s up the altered movement, due to that infinitesimal portion of primitive movement, which has been conveyed to it through countless channels, and which must continue to influence its path throughout its future existence. The air is one vast library, on whose pages is fore ver written all that man has ever said or even whispered. There, in their mutable but unerring characters, mi xed with the earliest as well as the latest signs of mortality, stand, forever recorded, vows unredee med, promises unfulfilled. God reads that book, though we cannot. So earth, air, and ocean, are the eternal witnesses of the acts that we have done. Every criminal is, by the laws of the Almighty, irrevocably chaine d to the testimony of his crime. No more fearful punishment to a superior intelligence can be concei ved, than to see still in action, with the consciousness that it must continue in action forev er, a cause of wrong, put in motion by itself ages before. There is its perpetual, its inevitable punishment, which no repentance can alleviate, and no mercy can remit. Let us be just, also, in judging of other men's mot ives. No man need covet the office of Judge, for, in assu ming it, he assumes the most serious and oppressive responsibility. On all accounts, therefore, let the true Mason neve r forget the solemn injunction, necessary to be observed at almost every moment of a busy life: \"Ju dge not, lest ye yourselves be judged; for whatsoever judgement ye measure unto others, the sa me shall in turn be measured unto you.\" Form of Closing High Priest. Companions and explorers of the bowels of the earth, be pleased to assist me in closing the lodge of Judges of the holy city of Jer usalem. Pray, Senior Companion, what is the last duty?

T. P. M. Most illustrious prince and brother Tito, your advice is too good to be neglected ; and to show you how much I am swayed by it, I now appoint you, Brother Adoniram, and Abda his father, to inspect the work. Go to the middle chamb er, and see if there be any of the chiefs of the five orders of architecture there. The grand Master of the Ceremonies withdraws to the other room, and inquires if there be any chiefs there. The candidate answers, - I am here. T he G. M. C. puts to him the following Q. Are you possessed of zeal to apply with scrupulo us attention to the works which the Thrice Puissant Master will commit to your care? A. I look upon it as the greatest happiness and adv antage I am blessed with. to have an opportunity of conversing with him on the great and glorious work, when he purposed to erect a temple to the Almighty, worthy of his glory. Adoniram receives from the candidate the sign, toke n, and word of the three first degrees; after which he leads him to the door of the lodge, and kn ocks three, five, and seven times at intervals.

He is allowed to p ass, and is taken by the hand by Adoniram, with the master's grip, to the middle of the lodge, where he is instructed to kneel on a square flag stone, opposite to a table, behind which Tito sits, who puts a sprig of cassia, or any other green sprig, into his hand, and then in that position, he takes the obligation: the penalty which is, to observe all rules laid down by the grand council of the princes of Jerusalem, under the penalty of all former obligations, with the addition, \"that hi s body may be severed in two, and bowels torn out, and given as a prey to the fowls of the air, i n justice and equity.'

He was was well convinced of their zeal and abilities, and therefore, hoped to to see the w ork completed in a masterly manner. We flatter ourselves, my dear brother, that you will contribut e with all your might to this grand end. As you represent a dead man, it must be to you an emblem, that, in order to succeed in this great work, you must execute it with the same spirit as our res pectable master, Hiram Abif, would have done. You must also be possessed of the same spirit and r esolution as he was - which was to prefer death to the divulging of the mysteries of the Orde r. We hope you will follow his example.

Traditional History G.: O.: My brother, but little need be said to you of the history of this degree, as it is fully given in the reception. You have on this occasion represente d one of the five chief architects appointed by King Solomon to conduct the work upon the Temple, i n the place of Hiram, the chief architect, who had been murdered. The king was always desirous of carrying to the highest state of perfection the work he had begun in Jerusalem, and upon the loss of the skilful Hiram, much concern was felt as to whether the original design of the structure could be completed and, also, as to whether the arrangements that had been projec ted for ornamentation and decoration would not fail for want of skill and ability on the part of the workmen. Pending these difficulties, on consultation, it was recommended by the High Priest , Sadoc, and Ahishar, Governor of the House, that five artificers, who had been pupils of Hiram, should be placed, as chiefs, over five departments in the construction of the edifice, and that at least the building could proceed, until they could find a Grand Master Architect. Page 49 of 242"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Adoniram, the son of Abda, was selected as the Pres ident of the Board of Architects, the others being Joabert, a Phoenician the chief artificer in brass; Stolkin, a Hebrew, chief carpenter; Selec, the Giblemite, chief stone-mason; and Gareb, a Hebr ew, chief worker in silver and gold, and chief engraver. King Solomon was well aware that the zeal and abili ties of these brethren would be exerted to the utmost in bringing to perfection so glorious a work . In like manner, we expect you to do all in your power to promote the grand design of Masonry, and t o bring to perfection the works of this Lodge of Intendants of the Building, exercising and propa gating charity and benevolence, educating the poor orphan, comforting the sick and distressed, an d providing refuge for the unfortunate. You have learned in your previous degrees that, in order to succeed in the great work of erecting a temple not made with hands, and dedicated to the Grand Architect of the Universe, you must emulate the same spirit, the same fortitude and res olution possessed by our Grand Master Hiram - preferring your integrity to your life. You will still advance toward the light -- toward t he star blazing in the distance - which is an emblem of the divine truth, given by God to the fir st men, and preserved amid all the vicissitudes of ages in the traditions and teachings of Masonry. Here, as everywhere in the world, Darkness struggles with Light, and clouds and shadows interv ene between you and the truth. You are now, my brother, a student of the morality of Masonry, with which, we trust, you will become imbued, as for some time you will be exclusi vely occupied in its study. Step by step you must advance toward perfection in the moral code of Masonry: each Masonic degree is meant to be one of those steps: each is a development of a p articular duty, and in the present one you are taught charity and benevolence. With these two virt ues, man can best prepare for that future which he hopes for. The law of our being is love of life-this wonderful creation of God-and its interests and adornments, love of the world; not a low and sensual love, not love of wealth, fame, ease, power, and splendour, not low worldliness, bu t the love of earth as the garden on which the Creator has lavished such miracles of beauty - as t he habitation of humanity - the dwelling-place of the wise, the good, the active, and the loving - the place for the exercise of the noblest passions, the loftiest virtues, and the tenderest s ympathies : this is the charity or love we would teach in this degree, for God himself is love, and every degree of charity that dwells in us is the participation of the divine nature.

The great purpose of the degree is to inculcate and illustrate this lesson: That we should be careful how we allow ourselves to be led away by an excess of zeal, even in a good cause, to in. dict, as an individual, the punishment justly due f or the violation of human or divine laws Page 51 of 242"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Free, Ancient and Accepted Scottish Masonry has no ambition to be considered a Charitable Institution, in the modern acceptation of that term .

The greatest of the divine virtues give n to man is Charity. It is that great vital principle of fraternity, of equality, and of liberty, which prompts a man to lo ve his neighbour as himself - it is humble, retiring, hath no shadow of envy, hatred, or maliceit is that love to mankind which prompts us to rush to the res cue of our brethren in adversity, as well as to rejoice with them in their prosperity.

Their aprons are lined and bordered with black. They wear a broad black ribbon from their left shoulder to their right hip, on the brea st of which are painted three heads of fear and terror. A poniard hangs to this ribbon, with nine r ed roses painted on it near the bottom, four on each side, and one in the centre. Each brother has a naked poniard lying at his feet. The plan of the draft of the lodge or chapter is an oblong squa re, at the upper part of which, to the right, is drawn the city of Jerusalem. At the left is represe nted a cave near the sea-side and the river Joppa, surrounded with rocks, in which a man is see n, lying with his head on a rock, a lamp burning by him, a poniard at his feet, a running st ream of water, and a cup. Over the mountain the setting sun is seen. In the middle of the draft app ears a bush, which seems to be on fire, occasioned by the reflection of a rainbow. A brilli ant star is fixed immediately over the cave, above the setting sun, to point out the retreat of the murderer. On the draft is likewise seen a winding road which leads from Jerusalem to Joppa. O n this road a dog ' is seen near to the cave, which is the figure under which the unknown person is drawn. A man closely follows, and, at a distance, are seen eight other men walking without order. Near the room where this chapter is held there must be a small room made to represent a cave, and a large stone in it for the candidate to sit upon, a little table with a lamp l ighted and, under it, the word REVENGE written. A poniard lies on the table, a spring or fountain r uns in the room, a cup to drink out of, and an effigy of a man asleep. In this chapter, the sovereign sits under a canopy, in an elevated chair of state covered with black. Before him stands a table covered with black and a grey coloured carpet, on which is a bible, a sceptre, and a dagger. Solomon strikes wit h his sceptre, and Stolkin strikes with his poniard, which he holds in his hand as a symbol of revenge. Form of Opening Q. Are you an elected Knight? A.

Know, my brother, that, at this moment, we have in our power one of the murderers o f our respectable Master, Hiram Abiff, who groans under the enormity of his guilt and expects every instant to undergo the rigorous torture which his crimes merit, to serve as an example to d eter others.

A. I shall be happy of the opportunity to revenge t he death of our dear Grand Master. T, P. M. I must previously inform you that this man is, perhaps, one of your acquaintances, probably your friend, or your brother; but in such a case as this every sentiment must give way to that of revenge, which, with you, is to stifle ever y other consideration, because no bad consequences will attend your accomplishment of thi s revenge. Besides, this is the only opportunity that offers of making us sensible of yo ur zeal, by which you will be admited into this degree; therefore, determine immediately. A. I am determined. T. P. M.

The candidate is now blindfolded and conducted to t he cave, where he is seated on a stone, opposite to the sleeping murderer. When seated, the guide tells him that he shall have to leave him for a while ; another brother shakes a parcel o f chains and groans heavily. The guide places the candidate's left hand on the table, tells him t o lay his head on his arm, and his right hand on his thigh and thus addresses him My dear brother, I must leave you a little while, b e of good courage, and not daunted. Promise me faithfully that you will remain in the posture in w hich 1 now leave you, however much alarmed you may be by any noise which you may hear. Attend to w hat I say ; for, if you neglect it, your life may be the cost. As soon as you hear a masonic knock, t ake the bandage from your eyes, and closely examine every object that is around you. When you h ear a second knock drink out of the cup, which you will find near your left hand. When you h ear a third knocking you must do exactly as a voice shall bid you. Although I leave you alone, be lieve me, the eyes of the whole chapter are upon you ; therefore, I beg that you will not fail to comply with these instructions. Farewell, I leav e you. He quits the room, and shuts the door sharply after him. In a minute or two he knocks three distinct knocks; after awhile he knocks again, as b efore; and then again when a voice tells the candidate to take that dagger and strike the villai n, first on the head, then in his heart. Cut off th e head and follow me with it in your left hand, and t he dagger in the right. He is again brought to the door of the lodge, and knocks eight and one.

The king, seeing the candidate, rises with great indign ation, and says : - Wretch! what have you done? My orders were, that the traitor should be ta ken and brought to me, not that you should put him to death. Your disobedience of orders shall, th erefore, cost you your life. Stolkin, put him to death.' On hearing this the brethren fall on one knee, and beg pardon from Solomon for the candidate, saying, that it was an excess of. zeal and love for the memory of our respected Master, Hiram.Abif, that prompted him to disobey the King's orders. While this entreaty is making, Stolkin seizes the candidate and stands ready to execute hi s orders. Solomon says - Stop! My Brother Joabert, I freely f orgive you, the second time, as you meant no wrong, but beware of the third offence - The head a nd poniard are then taken from him, and the obligation is administered. The penalty of this obligation embraces all those o f the foregoing with a promise to revenge masonry in general ; to protect the order of one's own brethren with all one's might and power ; to submit one's self to perish by the same weapon whic h will be given as an honourable mark of this order, and, as a reward for zeal and constancy. The Thrice Puissant raises the candidate and gives him the dagger, saying : - I deliver you this vindictive weapon : makea good use of it when requi red. The first sign of this order is for one to take a p oniard or sword and stab another on the forehead. The one that is struck claps his hand to his forehe ad to see if it is bloody.

You know that Solomou, on hearing that he was missing, put a stop to the building, and swore that no person should be paid his wages, until this great man was found dead or alive. You also recollect that the brethren went in search of him, and that Stolkin's good luck on this melancholy occasion, endeared him to the king, and procured him his grea test confidence. Nor was Solomon contented with having the funeral obsequies of that great man celebrated with as much splendour and magnificence as possible but was also determined to take public satisfaction with the perpetrators of that horrid crime, and to sacrifice them to the manes of his deceased friend. He issued a proclamation, offering a reward to any person who w ould give information where the villains were concealed ; and that he would even forgive the real assassin if he would come into his presence, acknowledge his guilt, and give up his accomplices, so that they might suffer condign punishment for the expiation of the greatest of crimes. This p roclamation was Iong out to no purpose. But one day, when Solomon was sitting in his hall, giving a udience to more than ninety masters and other officers of the order, Jerbel, Captain of the Guard s, entered and informed him that an unknown person wanted to speak to him in private, as he had a matter of high importance to impart. The brethren were alarmed at the readiness with which t he king consented to a private audience from fear of danger to his person ; but the audience bei ng short, a speedy return removed those fears. He informed them, this unknown person was acquainte d with the retreat of the murderers of Hiram Abif, and had offered to accompany such peopl e as would accompany him and inform themselves of the truth of what he asserted. The br ethren, to a man, immediately stood up and ofiered their services on that occasion. The king w as highly pleased at their zeal, but declared, that among such a number of virtuous brethren, they who should be employed in the honour of taking these victims of vengeance should be determi ned by lot The names of the Intendants of the Buildings who were present were put in a box, w hen the king declared the nine whose names should be first drawn should follow the unknown str anger and bring the traitors alive, to be made an example to the latest posterity. Lots were accor dingly drawn, and joy gladdened the faces of those whose names came out. These received instruct ions from the king to follow the unknown man, who would conduct them to the cave which was t he retreat of the traitors. They departed, but one of the nine, Joabert, whom you this day rep resent, animated with uncommon ardour, and thinking his brethren walked too slow, got before t hern, and was the first that came to the cave, which was situated near the sea side, not far from Joppa. Near it was a bush, which seemed to burn ; and a star, which had conducted them, stood fixed over the cave. Joabert, inflamed with rage, entered, and by the aid of a lamp which was b urning, saw the villain asleep lying on his back. A dagger lay at his feet, which Joabert seize d and struck with all his might, first on the head, and then in the heart. The villain sprang up with fury; but, immediately dropped dead at his feet, and pronounced the word Necum. Joabert cut of f his head, and then quenched his thirst at the spring in the cave, when he was joined by his b rethren, whom he was just going to meet. They, seeing the head of the villain, represented t o Joabert that he had committed a fault by his zeal, and that thus putting an end to the villain's life, he had rescued him from the tortures which Solomon had prepared for him. They promised to inte rcede and use their influence with the king to procure his pardon. All quenching their thirst, Joabert taking the head, they walked back to Jerusalem. On seeing them Solomon was about to give orders for the intended tortures ; but, espying the villain's head in the hands of Joabert, he could not restrain his wrath, and ordered Stolkin to put him to death. This would have been i nstantly executed had not all the brethren thrown theanselves on their knees and begged him of f, as the illustrious brethren of this chapter have done for you. From the historical circumstance s related you may see what useful instruction can be drawn. First, by the traitor's death, you se e that crimes never go unpunished; but that, sooner or later, they meet their deserts. Secondly, you may learn from Joabert's danger, how unsafe it is to exceed orders ; and that it is a ne cessary strictly to comply with the orders of your superiors. Thirdly, by the pardon procured for this zealous brother, you may learn, how easily the heart of a good king is influenced to be merciful. You also see how necessary it is to have friends who will interest themselves warmly for us on criti cal occadons.

Traditional History G.: O.: After the death of the Grand Master, the as sassins having made their escape, a great assembly of Masons was convened by King Solomon, to consult as to the best means of discovering and apprehending them. Their deliberati ons were interrupted by the entrance of a herdsman, who demanded to speak to the king. On bei ng admitted to an interview, he acquainted King Solomon that he had discovered persons conceal ed in a cave near the coast of Joppa, answering the description given of the traitors; an d he offered to conduct those whom the king should select to the place of their concealment. This being communicated to the Masters, they one an d all eagerly requested to be made participators in the vengeance due the assassins. S olomon checked their ardour, declaring that only nine should undertake the task; and to avoid g iving any offence, ordered a selection of nine of the brethren by lot, to accompany the stranger. At the first hour of the night, the favourite of King Solomon and eight others, conducted by the str anger, travelled onward through a rough and dreary country toward the coast of Joppa. On the wa y, the most ardent of the nine, learning that the murderers were hidden in a cavern not far from where they then were, pressed on ahead, found the cavern, entered it with the shepherd, whe re, by the dim light of the lamp, he discovered one of the assassins asleep, with a dagger at his f eet. Inflamed at the sight, and actuated by an impatient patient zeal, he immediately seized the d agger and stabbed him, first in the head and then in the heart. The assassin had only time to sa y \" Necum\" [pronounced nay-coom], or \" vengeance is taken,\" and expired. The avenger then quenched his thirst at the fountai n. When the eight arrived at the spot, they asked him what he had done. He replied, \" I have sl ain the assassin of our Grand Master, and have performed a feat for the honour and glory of t he Craft, for which I. hope to be rewarded.\" He then severed the head from the body, and taking it in one hand and his dagger in the other, with the eight returned to Jerusalem. In his zeal, however, he hastened into the presence of the king, passing the guards at the entrance. Solomon was at first very much offended t hat it had been put out of his power to take Page 62 of 242"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"vengeance in the presence of, and as a warning to, the rest of the workmen, and ordered the guards to put his favourite to death but by the int ercession of his brethren he was pardoned for his zeal, and they became reconciled. Solomon estab lished the grade of Master Elect of Nine, and conferred it upon the nine companions. Form of Closing the Chapter Solomon makes the sign by putting his hand to his f orehead and says : - My brethren, let us renew our obligation. (The brethren make the sign w ith their daggers, first striking the head and then the heart. Solomon strikes 8 and 1 : Stolkin d oes the same and the chapter is closed.) MASTER ELECT OF FIFTEEN The Tenth Grade of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and the Seventh Degree of the Ineffable Series ARGUMENT This degree is a continuation of the series known a s the Elu, or Elect degrees, and recounts in detail the mode of the arrest and punishment of the remaining assassins; and reminds us that the unerring eye of Justice will discover the guilty, a nd they suffer the punishment their crimes deserve.

Excellen t Grand Orator, what saith the law as to him who slayeth his brother? If an man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for h im, and rise up against him and smite him mortally, that he die, and fleeth into one of the c ities of refuge, then the Elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the Avenger of Blood, that he may die. Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt p ut away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee. Such is the law; and the land of Israel is not yet purified of the innocent blood of our brother shed upon the floor of the Temple. One of his assassins has suffered swift punishment, but two remain at large, nor have yet been traced from their retre at in the mountains of Joppa. I fear they have escaped by sea, and are beyond our reach. Most Potent King, doubt not that the Lord will at l ength give the two assassins into thy hand. T.: P.: I therefore declare you to be duly investe d with the rank and dignity of Illustrious Elu of t he fifteen which degree I declare to be devoted now an d always hereafter to Liberty and Toleration; and I invest you with its collar, apron, and jewel, which need no explanation. HISTORY G.: O.: About six months, it is said, after the exe cution of the assassin, as detailed in the degree of Master Elect of the Nine, Bengaber, an intendant of King Solomon, in the Country of Gath, which was tributary to him, caused diligent inquiry to be made if any person had lately taken shelter in that region who might be supposed to hav e fled from Jerusalem: he published at the same time an accurate description of the traitors w ho had made their escape. Shortly afterward he received information that persons answering the description had lately arrived there, and, believing themselves to be perfectly secure, had be gun to work in the quarry of Ben-Dekar. Page 66 of 242"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"As soon as Solomon was made acquainted with this ci rcumstance, he wrote to Maaka, King of Gath to assist in apprehending them, and to cause t hem to be delivered to persons he should appoint to secure them, and have them brought to Je rusalem to receive the punishment due to their crimes. Solomon then selected fifteen Masters in whom he co uld place the greatest confidence, and among whom were those nine who had been in the cave rn, and sent them with an escort of troops in quest of the villains. Five days were spe nt in the search, when Zerbal, who bore King Solomon's letter to King Maaka, with Stolkin and an other of his companions, discovered them cutting stone in the quarry. They immediately seize d them, and, binding them in chains, conducted them to Jerusalem. On their arrival they were imprisoned in the tower of Achizar, and the next morning received the punishment which thei r crimes deserved. This degree, my brethren, as you learned by your re ception and obligation, is devoted to the same objects as those of the Elu of the Nine; and a lso to the cause of the oppressed against the oppressor, and of toleration against intolerance; t hat is, to the cause of human freedom, corporal and mental, against tyranny exercised over the soul or body. The assassins of Hiram Abif, whose capture and exec ution are recounted in this degree, are the symbols of those special enemies of freedom of the body and the soul - Ambition, of which tyranny or despotism is born; and Fanaticism, from which springs intolerance and persecution. To the objects of this degree you have irrevocably con secrated yourself, and whenever in your presence a Chapter of this degree is opened, you wi ll be most impressively reminded of your solemn vows here taken at our altar.

HISTORY G.: Or.: The history of this degree is brief. After punishment had been inflicted on the murderers mentioned in the preceding degrees, King Solomon in stituted this degree, both as a recompense for the zeal and constancy of the Elus of the Fifte en, who had assisted him to discover them, and also to enable him to elevate other deserving breth ren from the lower degrees to those of places in the higher, which had been vacated by their prom otion. Twelve of these fifteen he elected Sublime Knights, and made the selection by ballot, that he might give none offence, putting the names of the whole in an urn. The first twelve that were drawn he formed into a Chapter, and Page 70 of 242"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"gave them command over the twelve tribes. He gave t hem the name of Emeth, which is a Hebrew word signifying a true man. He exhibited to them the precious things which were deposited in the tabernacle. These, my brother, are the chief objects delineated on our tracing- board, and these you should make the constant subje ct of your reflections. These last three degrees constitute what are called the Elu degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish rite. They elucidate a particular part of the legendary h istory of Freemasonry, and constitute a peculiar system which is necessarily contained in every rite . In the York rite the Elus are combined into one, and form a part of the third degree. In the Fr ench rite they constitute a separate degree, called \"Elu,\" and forming the fourth degree of that rite. In some of the other systems of Masonry the Elus have been divided into numerous degrees, b ut their purport is always the same to give details of the detection and punishment, by chosen or elected brethren, of those murderers who first stained the escutcheon of Freemasonry by an a trocious crime.

RECEPTION J.: G.: W.: A wise man will hear and increase in le arning, and a man of understanding will attain unto wise counsels; to understand a proverb, and th e interpretation; the word of the sages and their obscure sayings. J.: G.: W.: Wisdom preventeth them that covet her, so that she first showeth herself unto them. He that awaketh to seek her shall not labour; for h e shall find her sitting at his door. The Lord giveth wisdom; out of his mouth come knowledge and understanding. J.: G.: W.: When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul, discretion shall preserve thee, and understanding s hall keep thee, and thou shalt understand righteousness, judgment, equity, and every good pat h. S.: G.: W.: I wished, and understanding was given m e; and I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me, and I preferred her before kin gdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison to her. The Lord by wisdom ha th founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. Page 74 of 242"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"S.: G.: W.: Get wisdom! Exalt her, and she shall pr omote thee; she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her. She shall give to thy h ead an ornament of grace; a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. T.: P.: No evil can overcome wisdom. She glorifieth her nobility by being conversant with God, and the Lord of all things loveth her. For it is sh e that teacheth knowledge of God and is the expounder of His works. T.: P.: She knoweth things past, and judgeth things to come.

By means of her w e shall, have immortality. LECTURE It is the true Masonic Light. He who obeys the Maso nic law shall find it. The degree which you seek was first conferred upon Adoniram, the son of Abda, when he was appointed Chief Architect of the Temple, and as such the successor of the Mas ter Hiram after having been for a time the chief of the five Intendants of the Building, and a fter his skill and science as an architect had been thoroughly tested, and he found to be superior to t he other four Intendants. It was but the ceremony of his investiture with that office. After ward it became an honorary degree, conferred first upon the other Intendants, and then upon the Elus, as a mark of honour and distinction. As he advanced, the ancient Freemason ceased to work w ith the instruments of the labourer the square, the level, the plumb, and the trowel, and a ssumed those of the Architect and Geometrician. As he advanced, also, he passed from that branch of geometry and mathematics which occupies itself with the earth, its surface a nd the things, that belong to it, with right lines and angles, and all the figures formed thereby, to the mathematics of the heavens and the spheres. We no longer occupy ourselves with geometr y and mathematics as sciences, nor expect of our initiates a knowledge of their problems, or even of their terms. To us the instruments of the geometrician, and all the figures, plane and spheri cal, drawn by these instruments, have a symbolical meaning. By means of the morality of Mas onry, we advance toward its philosophy, and every degree is a step in that direction. If yo u would succeed to the rank held by Adoniram,. you must assume the obligation which it imposes. INVESTMENT T.: P.: I invest you with the apron, collar, and je wel of this degree. Their colours white and blue, will remind you of what is commonly called symbolic Masonry, or the Blue degrees, - the foundation, but not the completion and perfection o f Masonry. Upon the apron and jewel you see the five orders of Architecture, and the instrument s of a Grand Master Architect; the symbolic meaning of which you have yet to learn. I now prese nt you with the instruments with which a Grand Master Architect works. Listen, and you shall learn their uses, and of what they are the symbols to us in this degree. T.: P.: Such are the instruments of a Grand Master Architect, and such the lessons which they teach us. Forget not that you have solemnly sworn t o practise all the virtues which they symbolically teach; for thus only can you deserve, how proudly so ever you may wear the title of a Grand Master Architect. HISTORY The history of this degree is brief, as its ceremon ies are simple. After the murderers of the Master Hiram Abif had been discovered, apprehended, tried, and punished, his monument and mausoleum completed, and the matters which concerne d the revenue of the realm provided for, Page 75 of 242"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"King Solomon, to assure uniformity of work and vigo ur in its prosecution, and to reward the superior and eminent science and skill of Adoniram. . the son of Abda, appointed him to be chief Architect of the. Temple, with the title of Grand M aster Architect, and invested him with that office, as sole successor and representative of the decease d Master Hiram Abif, and at the same time made him Grand Master of Masons and the Masonic pee r of and King Hiram of Tyre Afterward the title conferred upon other Princes of the Jewis h Court as an honorarium, and thus the degree became established. You have heard what are the les sons taught by the working instruments of a Grand Master Architect, and I shall not now enlarge upon those lessons. The great duties which they inculcate demand much of us, and take for gran ted our capacity to perform them fully. We hope that we are not mistaken in believing that you possess that capacity, and in expecting that you will be always be found equal to the task which you thus have thus imposed upon yourself. CLOSING S.: G.: W.:. The sun has set, and the evening star has risen. T.: P.: The hour of rest has arrived. Give notice t o the Grand Masters that this Chapter of Grand Master Architects is about to be closed, that they may aid in so doing. S.: G.: W.: Brethren in the North, the Thrice Poten t Grand Master is about to close this Chapter of Grand Master Architects, and desires your assistanc e since the hour of rest has arrived.

RECEPTION I shall now invest you with the apron, collar, and jewel of a Knight of the Ninth or Roya l Arch. The colour of your apron and collar is purple, and denotes the royal origin of the degree and the dignity of your station. The jewel alludes to the delta or golden plate found in the subterranean arch, a more full description of which will be obtained by attending to the history and lecture of the degree. HISTORY G.: O.: Companions: this is the history and legend of this degree. Enoch, the son of Jared, was the sixth in descent from Adam. Filled with the love and fear of God, he strove to lead men in the way of honour and duty. In a vision the Deity appeared to him in the visible shape of a pure golden triangle, and said to him, \" Enoch, thou hast longed to know my true name: arise and follow me, and thou shalt know it.\" Enoch, accepting his vision as an inspiration, journeyed in search of the mountain he had seen in his dream, until, weary of t he search, he stopped in the land of Canaan, then already populous with the descen dants of Adam, and there employed workmen; and with the help of his son Methusel ah, he excavated nine apartments, one above the other, and each roofed with an arch, as he had seen in his dream, the lowest being hewn out of the solid r ock. In the crown of each arch he left a narrow aperture, closed with a square sto ne, and over the upper one he built a modest temple, roofless and of huge unhewn stones, to the Grand Architect of the Universe. Upon a triangular plate of gold, inlaid with many precious gems, he engraved t he ineffable name of God, and sank the plate into one face of a cube of agate. None knew of the deposit of the precious treasure; and, that it might remain undiscovered, and survive the Flood, which it was known to Enoch would soon Page 80 of 242"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"overwhelm the world in one vast sea of mire, he covered the aperture, and the stone that closed it and the great ring of iron used to raise the stone, with the granite paveme nt of his primitive temple. Then, fearing that all knowledge of the arts and sciences would be lost in the universa l flood, he built two great columns upon a high hill-one of brass, to resist water, and one of granite, to resist fire. On the granite column was written in hieroglyphic s a description of the subterranean apartments; on the one of brass, the rudiments of the arts and science s. The granite column was overturned and swept away, and worn to a shapeless mass by the Deluge, but that of brass stood firm, and was found by Noah. Thenceforward the true name of God remained unknown until he said unto Moses in Egypt, when he orde red him to go to Pharaoh, and cause him to send forth the children of Israel out of Egypt: \" I am that which I was and shall be: I am the God of thy fathers; the God of Abraham, of Isaac,, and of Jacob. Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, HE who is hath sent me unto you. 1 am the Lord, that appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob by my name AL-SHEDI but my name - I did not show them.\" Moses engraved the ineffable name upon a plate of gold, and deposited it in the ark of the covenant. Moses made the name known to Aaron and Joshua, and afterwards it was made known to the chief priests. The word being composed of consonants only, its true pronunciation was soon lost, but the word still remained in the ark; and in the time of Othniel in a battle against the King of Syria, those who bore the ark were slain, and the ark fell to the ground. After the battle, the men of Israel, searching for it, were led to it by the roaring of a lion, which, crouching by it, had guarded it, holding the golden key in its mouth. Upon the approach of the High-priest and Levites, he laid down the key, and withdrew. Hence, upon the golden key worn by the treasurer, you see the initials of these words: \"In are leonis verbum inveni\"---~'In the lion's mouth I found t he word.\" This plate of gold was melted down, and made into an image of Dagon by the Philistines, who took it in battle. David intended to build a temple to God. but bequea thed the enterprise to Solomon, his son, and Solomon selected a place near Jerus alem; but finding Page 81 of 242"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"overthrown columns of Enoch's temple, and supposing the m to be the ruins of a heathen temple, and not wishing to select a desecrated sp ot, selected Mount Morlah for the site of his Temple to the true God. Un der this temple he built a secret vault, the approach to which was through eight ot her vaults, all under ground, and to which a long and narrow passage led un der the king's palace. In the ninth apartment was placed a twisted column of whit e marble, on which it was intended to place the ark, and in this apartment h e held his private conferences with King Hiram of Tyre and Hiram Abif, th ey only knowing the way by which it was approached. Solomon proposed to erect a Temple of Justice, and selected as a site the spot where Enoch's temple ha d stood, and to that end directed that the fallen columns and rubbish should be removed. Gibulum, Joabert, and Stolkin were selected to survey the ground and lay off the foundations.

And now in adoration bow To Him who hears and seals each vow: Glory to God, who reigns above, And to our fellow-creatures, love! INVESTMENT I now invest you with the apron, girdle, collar, an d jewel of a Grand Elect Mason ; and with the greatest pleasure salute you with the title, and gr ace you with the symbols thereof. The collar is emblematical of ardent zeal, affectio n, and charity. The crown upon your jewel is a symbol of the royal origin. of the degree. The comp ass, extended to ninety degrees, denotes the extensive knowledge of the Grand Elect: the sun, in the centre, that our actions should be as open as the full blaze of the noon-day sun, and our charity as diffusive as its beams. This jewel, suspended upon your breast, should make you attenti ve to your duties, and cause you to walk so as to adorn your station. The apron, my brother, which you wear, is white, li ned with white, and bordered with gold. The white is to remind us of innocence, and of that pur ity which was required for an entrance to this place; the gold, of wisdom, which should characteri ze all Grand Elect Masons. Its form is supposed to be the true form used by the Perfect Ma ster Mason at the building of the Temple, and alludes to the golden triangle or delta of Enoc h which adorns the centre. The girdle, which I also invest you with, is the an cient girdle of a Grand Elect Mason. It was used of old to bind up and strengthen the body, and enab le man to persist in his labours it is, therefore, an emblem of activity, promptness, and perseverance . The girdle was also used to bind up the garments, and prevent them from flying open and dis covering nakedness in it, therefore, it is an emblem of charity, the observance of which has laid you under renewed obligations. It was also used for beauty and ornament. Let it be your endeav our to be adorned and rich in the many virtues and qualities which are represented by its various colours. The colours are arranged according to the mystic nu mbers of this degree-3, 5, 7, 9. The three are blue, red, and yellow, by the due mix ture of which the primitive colours are all formed. The five consist of the first three, and green and purple. The seven consist of the first five, and of white a nd black. The nine consist of the first seven, and of stone a nd flame colour Page 91 of 242"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"They are thus explained: The blue is an emblem of f riendship; the red of zeal; the yellow of wisdom, on account of its resemblance to gold. Wisd om, saith the wisest of kings, is far better than fine gold. The green is a beautiful emblem of hope, and of that immortal part of man which never, never dies; the purple, being a royal colour of dignity and majesty; the white, of purity and innocence ; the black, of seriousness and modestnes s of demeanor. The next colour is that of stone, which denotes firmness and durability, and i s an emblem of constancy, fidelity, and decision of character - qualities which should be p ossessed by those who take the degree of Grand Master Architect, and attempt to walk in the footsteps of our Grand Master H.: A.:; and the flame colour of ardent affection and charity, the p eculiar traits of a Grand Elect Mason.

CHARGE Thus, my brother, by your meritorious and unblamabl e conduct, assiduity, constancy, and integrity, you have at last attained the title of G rand Elect Mason, which is the summit of Ancient Craft Masonry, and upon your arrival to which I mos t sincerely congratulate you. I most earnestly recommend to you the strictest car e and circumspection in all your conduct, that the sublime mysteries of this degree be not profane d or disgraced. As to what remains of completing your knowledge of Ancient Graft Masonry, you will find, by attending to the following history of the degree, a nd a careful study of its mysteries. You will now proceed to the Grand Orator, in the So uth, who will instruct you in the HISTORY G.: Or.: My brother, you were informed in the degre e of Royal Arch that King Solomon builded a secret vault, the approach to which was through eig ht other vaults, all under ground, and to which a long and narrow passage led from the palace. The ninth arch or vault was immediately under the Holy of Holies of the Temple. In that apartment King Solomon held his private conferences with King Hiram and Hiram Abif. After the death of Hiram Abif the two kings ceased to visit it, resolving not to do so until they should select one to fill his place; and that, until that time, they would make known the sacred name to no one. After A doniram, Joabert, and Stolkin had discovered the cube of agate and the mysterious nam e, and had delivered it to King Solomon, the two kings determined to deposit it in the secret va ult, permit the three Masters - who discovered it to be present, make known to them the true pronunci ation of the ineffable word, constitute the last degree of Ancient Craft Masonry, and term it Grand Elect Mason. The cube of agate was so deposited. Afterward the twelve Princes of Ameth, the nine Ele ct, and the Chief Architect were admitted to this degree. The secret vault was thereafter called Sacred Vault, and was originally built by Hiram Abif and none but Grand Elect Masons knew of its ex istence, or knew other than the substituted word. The Temple was completed in the year 3000 - six yea rs, six months, and ten days after King Solomon had laid the first cornerstone ; and its co mpletion was celebrated with great pomp and splendid magnificence. Page 92 of 242"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Subsequently, while the Temple was being dedicated, King Solomon conferred this sublime degree on the twenty-five brethren we have mentione d, and in the form you have but now witnessed. And when the singers and trumpeters were to make on e sound in praise and thanks to the Lord, saying, \" Praise the Lord, for he is good: his merc y endureth forever.\" that the Temple was filled with a cloud, and the name was fully pronounced. On the second day, an audience was given to all Mas ons, from the degree of Master to the Royal Arch, and all vacancies were filled. On the third day, King Solomon devoted his time to advancing and raising Fellow Crafts and Entered Apprentices. Thus far the wise King of Israel behaved worthy of himself, and gained universal admiration; but in process of time, when he had advanced in years, his understanding became impaired; he grew deaf to the voice of the Lord, and was strangely ir regular in his conduct. Proud of having erected an edifice to his Maker, and much intoxicated with his great power, he plunged into all manner of licentiousness and debauchery, and profaned the Tem ple by offering incense to the idol Moloch, which, only should have been offered to the living God. The Grand Elect Masons saw this, and were sorely grieved, being fearful that his apostas y would end in some dreadful consequences, and perhaps bring upon them those enemies whom Solo mon had vainly and wantonly defied. The people, copying the follies and vices of their king, became proud and idolatrous, neglecting the true worship of God for that of idols. As an adequate punishment for this defection, God i nspired the heart of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, to take vengeance on the kingdom of Israel . This prince sent an army, with Nebuzaradan, captain of the guards, who entered Jud ah with fire and sword, took and sacked the city of Jerusalem, razed its walls, and destroyed t hat superb model of excellence, the Temple. The people were carried away captive to Babylon, an d the conquerors carried away with them all the vessels of gold and silver. This happened four hundred and seventy years, six m onths, and ten days after the dedication. After the city was taken, and. the king's palace an d the Temple demolished, some of the Grand Elect Masons bethought themselves of the Sacred 'Va ult and the inestimable treasure it contained. Repairing to the ruins of the Temple at night, they found that, the way which led down to the vault had not been discovered, nor the slab of marble which covered it disturbed but upon it they found the dead body of Galaad, an eminent brot her, and Chief of the Levites. He had been intrusted with the custody of the Sacred Vault and the care of the lamps that burned continually. Finally, when the time arrived that the Christian P rinces entered into a league to free the Holy Land from the oppression of the infidels, the good and virtuous Masons, anxious for so pious an undertaking, offered their services to the confeder ates, upon condition that they should have a chief of their own election, and whose name was onl y made known in the hour of battle; which being granted, they accepted their standard and dep arted. The valour and fortitude of these Elected Knights w ere such, that they were admired by, and took the lead of, all the Princes of Jerusalem, who, bel ieving that their mysteries inspired them with courage and fidelity to the cause of virtue and rel igion, became desirous of being initiated. Upon being found worthy, their desires were complied wit h, and thus the Royal Art, meeting the approbation of great and good men, became popular a nd honourable, and was diffused to the worthy throughout these dominions, and thus continu ed to spread, far and wide, through a succession of ages to the present day.

ARGUMENT This degree, which is intimately connected with the one that succeeds it, relates to the Babylonish captivity, which lasted seventy years, the release and return of the 42,360 captives to Jerusalem, and the attempt to build the Second Temple under th e direction of Zerubbabel or Sheshbazzar. King Cyrus also permitted the return of the Holy Ve ssels and Ornaments which had been removed by Nebuzaradan at the time of the destructi on of the First Temple. The return of the captives was contested at the bri dge over the river Euphrates, but unsuccessfully; and finally, when labouring to lay the foundation of the Temple, beset on every side by enemies, Zerubbabel ordered that the Masons should work with the sword in one hand and a trowel in the other, that they might be able at any moment to defend themselves from attack. The Second Temple was forty-six years in constructi on. The purpose of the Degree of Knight of the East or Sword is to animate and encourage the Mason to be active in his duties, by presenting in an effective manner some illustrious examples of Humility, Patience, Truth, Wisdom, Chivalric cou rage and Devotion, as displayed by our ancient Brethren. and also to preserve the remembra nce of the events upon which the grade is founded.

This Temple covered the same ground as the one destroyed by Nebuzaradan, and was furnished with the same precious vessels returned b y King Darius from Babylon to the Jews.

RECEPTION Zer.: O King, the Masonic people whom I have the ho nour to govern, wishing to testify to you their joy at the advancement of your august majesty to th e throne, have deputed me, with these illustrious Knights, my companions, to tender to yo u their congratulations on your ascension to the throne of all the East. You have their sincere wishes for your health and happiness. In consequence of the kindness and benevolence with which you formerly favoured me, they have been induced to hope that, in choosing me as t heir representative, you would be pleased the more graciously to receive what I have to Commu nicate in their behalf; and I myself am happy, while paying you their tribute of respect, t o have the opportunity to acquit myself also of what is due to our former friendship. Darius.: Zerabbabel your people have not misjudged. They could not have selected an agent to act for them that could possibly have been more acc eptable to me than thou art. We notice with pleasure that you have not forgotten our ancient ties of affection and friendship; and Darius will not, on his part, forget those ties which were dear to him while yet in private life. Your arrival among us is very opportune, to enable you to participate in the feast we give this day to the grandees of our kingdom, and to this we invi te you and your associates. Previous to which we wish you to pronounce your opinion on a certain question that shall be propounded for discussion. Page 106 of 242"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Satrap of Assyria, do you state the question, and t he reward we have promised to him who shall answer it in the most satisfactory manner. Sat.: of A.: The King of Kings, wishing to dispense his favours with a liberal hand, has deigned to promise the second place near his august majesty, t he privilege of being clothed in purple, wearing a golden baldric, and being seated on a gol den throne, to him who shall be able in the most satisfactory manner to resolve the question: \" What is that which holds the. most powerful sway over mortals ?\" Can it be possible that a question like this can fo r one moment be a subject of doubt or deliberation to any one who adverts to thee, thou S on of the Sun? You have this day, composing your court, one hundred and twenty-seven potentates of the most distant nations. Peace and war are in your hands. The life and death of your subje cts depend upon your will. A word from your lips is a decree to all the earth. All we possess b elongs to thee. Our very persons are yours. The universal world has no master but you. There cannot be a more puissant, than Darius, King of all the East-Sovereign of Sovereigns. Therefore I say, The King Darius.\" Sat.: of M.: What remains for me to say, O King? Sh all I dare to differ in opinion from the Satrap of Assyria, who has received the plaudits of your w hole, court? He contends there is nothing greater than yourself. O King! I acknowledge your g reatness--the eclat of your name, the splendour of your throne, the magnitude of your pow er, and the grandeur of your riches. But greater than all this is the empire of Beauty! This softens the heart of the most ferocious, gains over judges the most severe, and triumphs ove r masters the most imperious. Deprived of fortune, it needs it not. If devoid of worldly rank and dignity, it rises above all. All stations of l ife are sub subject to it. The power of the gods of the earth, though respected and feared, is as nothing in comparison with the power of Beauty. The will of sovereign rulers often depends upon its caprice. What was my daughter Apame? Without wealth or rank, before her beauty elevated her to the nuptial bed of Darius. To-day this great Prince rules over you. In her turn, she reign s over him. He wills what she desires - he does what she approves. Does she rejoice, he is pleased. Is she melancholy, he is afflicted. She is the soul that gives the impress and the bias to all his movements. From her he learns to find something more interesting than kingly greatness. S he sees him at her feet, and he voluntarily submits all his imperial glory to her beauty. There fore I say, \"Beauty.\" Zer.: What is this, O Darius, I hear in your court? Is it. already corrupted by flattery and effeminacy? Reject! reject with indignation those s entiments of yourself that have just been uttered. Strength and power reside in kings. Beauty has its influence, but it is the mark of wisdom to acknowledge the empire of Truth. Truth is omnipo tent - greater than. any transitory throne - more endurable than any frail decaying beauty. Thes e are both of short duration but truth lives forever. The power of kings, as well as that of beauty, is s ubject to the revolutions of chance. Truth changes never - always pure, always simple. It is t he essence of the Grand Architect of the universe. It is the tie of all treaties. It is the motive of every just action, the basis of all laws, the seal of sovereign majesty, the object of every good man's search. We love those who demonstrate it, and detest those who conceal it. Ly ing disguises it, and, by borrowing its appearance, furnishes the best proof and clearest a vowal of its superiority. Considerations more powerful than human, O King, induce me thus to dare to speak to you in its favour in opposition to the too flattering sentiments which might have sedu ced you from the true path. You are yourself, great Prince, I am sure, about to confirm by your d ecision the empire of Truth.

The highest reward we can bestow upon you will not be commensurate with your deserts for having saved us from this snare of corruption. We a re infinitely indebted, besides the recompense offered, and in order to attach nearer to our perso n so precious a friend as thou art, Zerubbabel, we tender you, this moment, the office of Grand Mas ter of our House. Zer.: Sovereign of Sovereigns, for the favours whic h you lavish on me, I have not words to express my heartfelt gratitude; but the will of Him who regulates the destinies of all men, does not permit me to be the master of my own destiny. I am irrevocably bound to the fortunes of my people whom I conduct; and the accomplishment of th e decrees of heaven, relative to the re- edification of God's holy Temple, will not allow me to accept what you are so willing to do for me this day. DECREE Darius, King of Kings, Sovereign of Sovereigns, to Saraboyan, Grand Master of the Army, and to our other Grand Officers, and to our people beyond the river, Greeting: Zerubbabel and the Deputies of the Jews, having bro ught their complaints of the troubles with which you harass them, in their efforts to reconstr uct their Temple and city, which Cyrus, of glorious memory, had permitted them to build, we wr ite this letter; commanding you, as soon as you receive it, without fail to second, with all yo ur zeal and our authority, the execution of the work. If any one dare to impeach these our commands, or i n any way hinder the execution of them, we order you to crucify him, and to confiscate his pro perty for the use of the holy Temple. As a mark of our confidence in Zerubbabel, we creat e him Sovereign Prince of Jerusalem, and on the Knights that accompanied him in his embassy we confer the rank and title of Princes, with such powers as he shall establish on them; and we g rant him full power and authority to install Princes, and elevate to the dignity of Princes of t he Cities those whom he may see fit, and deem worthy and capable.

The mother-of-pearl denotes pu rity; the scales, justice; the dagger, vengeance; the five stare, Zerabbabel and his four companions. HISTORY Knights, and Princes, I deem it unnecessary to narr ate to you an extended history of this degree. Like the preceding one, the ceremony is so replete with the incidents relating to the history of the re-edification of the Temple, that little need be a dded. The first fourteen degrees of Ineffable Masonry hav e reference to the construction of the first Temple the demolition of it by Nebuzaradan, under t he authority of Nebuchadnezzar and Balthasar, and the conveying to Babylon of all the precious vessels and material; also, the driving into the fastnesses of the mountains and the uncult ivated country all Masons Of whatever grade. The fifteenth and sixteenth degrees have direct ref erence to the reconstruction of the Temple by Zerubbabel; first, by permission of Cyrus, King of Persia-as exemplified in the fifteenth degree- and then more completely by the sanction of his suc cessor, King Darius, who (with Artaxerxes) made every effort to restore the Temple in its beau ty, and to refurnish it with the precious vessels taken from the first edifice. After the sacking of Jerusalem, and the destruction of King Solomon's Temple, the Masons remained captives and exiles for seventy years, dur ing all which period they kept faithfully their promise to rebuild the Temple of their God, by pres erving some portions of the holy furniture and holding Masonic Lodges. Shortly subsequent to obtai ning permission of King Cyrus to reconstruct the edifice, and while the foundation was not yet c omplete, Cyrus died. Great apathy and indifference, in consequence, existed among the bre thren, more especially as they were the subjects of hatred by the various tribes of Samarit ans and Syrians, who constantly harassed them; and they were compelled, if they continued th eir work at all, to labour with the sword in one, hand and the trowel in the other. In the second yea r of the reign of King Darius, however, the High Priest succeeded in arousing a spirit of indus try, and obtaining the consent of Zerubbabel to again make application for protection and liberty t o rebuild the Temple. Darius, or Darayavaste, in the Persian part of the great triangular inscription at Behestun, on the frontier of ancient Media, reigned 485 years B. C. He was 29 years old when he ascended the throne, and reigned 36 years. The friendship of Darius for Zerubbabel, in his you nger days, gave opportunity for the pressure of the suit of the Jews; and by the power of truth - a s exhibited in the striking incident in the ceremony - permission in its amplest form was obtai ned from the king, and Zernbbabel created a Prince: which honour was confirmed by the Jews, and made a Masonic grade of distinction.

ARGUMENT The Seventeenth degree of the Rite Ancient and Acce pted, is the first of the series of Modem or Accepted degrees, as used in contradistinction to t he term Ancient, It may also be designated, the first of the Philosophic degrees. The Word is again lost, and, figuratively, the thir d Temple - in the heart of man - is to be built and dedicated to the God of Truth. The revelations made in the ceremony of initiation cannot be fully understood in this degree, as they are introductory to the succeeding degree of Rose-Croix, in which mysterium consumum est . When the Knights and Princes united to conquer the Holy Land, they took an oath to spend, if necessary, the last drop of their blood to establis h the true religion of the Most High God. Peace having been made, they could not practically fulfil their vows, and therefore, on returning to their respective countries, they resolved to do in theory what they could not do in practice.

Remember that it, like the other insignia of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, is honourable only so long as it is worn with honour. On the brow of the dishonest, the diss ipated, the vicious, or the base, honours undeserved are the extremest disgrace. See, therefo re, that you wear it worthily and well.

LECTURE My brother, this Preceptory is in the form of a hep tagon, hung with crimson, and sprinkled with stars of gold. In each angle is a column, on the ca pitals of which, beginning at the southeast and going round by the southwest in regular succession, are the initials respectively of the words Beauty, Divinity, Wisdom, Power, Honour Glory, and Force - the seven mystic characters of the heptagon, signifying: Beauty, to adorn our works. Divinity, to study which is one of our principal ai ms. Wisdom to invent and work. Power to punish and confound the calumnies of wicke d brethren and the profane. Honour is an indispensable quality in a Freemason, to labour with respectability. Glory, that the true Freemason is an equal to the p rince or potentate. Force, which is necessary to support and maintain u s On the bases of the columns you will observe the in itials of the seven qualities which should be possessed by brethren of this grade: FRIENDSHIP, UNION, RESIGNATION, DISCRETION, FIDELIT Y, PRUDENCE, TEMPERANCE. Friendship is a virtue which ought to reign among t he brethren. Union is the foundation of our society. Resignation to the regulations and decrees of the o rder without murmuring. Discretion, that as a Mason you should be on your g uard and never suffer yourself to be surprised in relation to our mysteries. Fidelity, to observe all your engagements. Prudence, to conduct yourself so that the profane, though jealous, may never be able to censure your conduct. Temperance, to always avoid every excess which may tend to injure the soul or body. The seven vices which all good and true Freemasons will ever strive to avoid are: Page 119 of 242"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"HATRED, PRIDE, DISCORD, INDISCRETION, PERFIDY, RASH NESS, CALUMNY. Hatred injures all the fine feelings of the heart. Discord is contrary to the very principle of societ y Pride prevents the exercise of humility. Indiscretion is fatal to Freemasonry. Perfidy should be execrated by every honest man. Rashness leads into unpleasant and difficult dilemm as Calumny, the worst of all, should be shunned as a v ice which saps the very foundations of friendship and society. The Book of the Seven Seals, which only one can ope n, is Masonically explained as representing a Lodge or Council of Masons, which the all-puissan t alone has the right or power to convene or open. The breaking of the first seal displayed a bow, arr ows rows, and crown, signifying that the orders of this Preceptory should be executed with as much promptness and exactitude as an arrow sent from a bow, and be received with as much submission as if they came from a crowned head. The second seal displayed the sword, denoting that this Preceptory and the order in general is always armed for its defence and to punish the guil ty. The third seal revealed the balance - the symbol th at Masonry should always act with justice in all her ministrations. The fourth seal produced the skull, which is the re presentative of that brother who has caused himself to be excluded from the Lodge or Preceptory . The fifth seal displayed a white cloth stained with blood, invoking us that we should not hesitate if necessary, to spill our blood in the defence or in the promotion of the cause of Freemasonry. The sixth seal when opened caused the sun to be dar kened and the moon to be changed to blood, as a representation of the power of Supreme Councils to interdict the works of inferior bodies, when irregular, until they shall have ackno wledged their error and submitted to the rules and regulations of the Craft. The seventh seal when broken was followed by silenc e, broken by the successive blasts of the seven trumpets, signifying that Freemasonry is exte nded over the surface of the earth on the wings of the wind and fame, and supports itself wit h honour The perfume from the altar represents the good odour of virtue, and denotes th at the life of a good Freemason should be free from all reproach and perfumed by a good report. Your Masonic age is very ancient, and you are terme d a Patmian, as coming from Patmos.

HISTORY Lecturer.: This, my brother, is the first of the Ph ilosophical degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, and the beginning of a course of instruction which will fully unveil the heart and inner mysteries of Masonry. Do not despair because you ha ve often seemed on the point of attaining the inmost light, and have as often been disappoint ed. In all time truth has been hidden under symbols, and often under a succession of allegories - where veil after veil had to be penetrated before the true light was reached and the essential truth stood revealed. We are about to approach those ancient religions wh ich once ruled the minds of men, and whose ruins encumber the plains of the great Past, as the broken columns of Palmyra and Tadmor lie bleaching on the sands of the desert. They rise bef ore us - those old, strange, mysterious creeds and faiths - shrouded in the mists of antiquity, an d stalk dimly and undefinedly along the line that divides time from eternity, and forms of strange, w ild, startling beauty mingle in the vast throng of figures with shapes monstrous, grotesque, and hideo us. The religion taught by Moses, which, like the laws of Egypt, enunciated the principle of exclusion, borrowed at every period of its existence from all the creeds with which it came in contact. . While by the study of the learned and wise, it enriched i tself with the most admirable principles of the religions of Egypt and Asia, it was changed in the wanderings of the people, by everything that was impure or seductive in the pagan manners and su perstitions. It was one thing in the time of Aaron and Moses, another in that of David and Solom on, and still another in that of Daniel and Philo. At the time when John the Baptist made his appearan ce in the desert, near the shores of the Dead Sea, all the old philosophical and religious s ystems were approximating to each other, while the philosophers of Greece, all (except the discipl es of Epicurus) more or less Platonicians, seized eagerly upon the beliefs and doctrines of th e East. The Jews and Egyptians, before then the most exclusive of all people, yielded to that e clectism which prevailed among their masters, the Greeks and Romans. It was held by a vast number , even during the preachings of Paul, that the writings of the Apostles were incomplete, that they contained only the germs of another doctrine, which must receive from the hands of phil osophy not only the systematic arrangement which was wanting, but all the developments which l ay concealed therein-mysteries handed down from generation to generation in esoteric tradition .

This degree, like the one preceding it, is philosop hical. The end of all philosophy is to free the mind from those encumbrances which hinder its progr ess toward perfection and to raise it to the contemplation of Immutable Truth and the knowledge of divine and spiritual objects. This effect must be produced by easy steps, lest the mind, hith erto conversant only with sensible things, should revolt at the change. Knight of the Eagle and Pelican is one of the title s applied to a Rose-Croix H-R-D-M Freemason; yet that degree is not strictly an order of knighth ood, in the commonly received sense of the term. In these degrees, it is readily perceivable that w e have now fully entered upon a long course of instruction into all the mysteries of the esoteric doctrine.

The following words of one of the most eminent students of Masonry, and an ardent admirer of the A .: and A.: Rite, may be quoted here. If anywhere brethren of a particular religious beli ef have been excluded from this degree, it merely shows how gravely the plans and purposes of Masonry may be misunderstood; for whenever the door of any one degree is closed again st him who believes in one God and the soul's immortality, on account of the other tenets of his faith, that degree is no longer Masonry, which is universal, but some other thing, that is e xclusive, and accordingly Intolerant, Each degree erects a platform on which the Israelite, th e Mahommedan, and the Christian may stand side by side and hand in hand, as brethren.\" Whatev er your religion, your birth- place, or your language, you are among brethren. One language is s poken in common, the language of the Scottish Rite of Masonry, which speaks directly to the heart. APARTMENTS The ceremony of Reception of a Knight of the Eagle and Pelican requires properly four apartments, as follows. FIRST APARTMENT The first apartment is hung in black, spread with w hite tears; and is lighted simply by the taper of the Most Wise, the two lights on the throne, and th e dim light of three transparencies. Three columns, of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders of architecture respectively, about five feet in height, are appropriately placed in the Cha pter, and support on their capitals transparent inscriptions of the three virtues, one on each, whi ch should be removed when the Chapter is closed. The canopy in the East is black, bordered with whit e fringe; on the platform below it is the irregular throne of the Chapter, surmounted by thre e crosses, the centre one most prominent, with a full-blown white rose upon it: on either sid e thereof is a candlestick with a yellow wax candle lighted. Both throne and crosses are to be c oncealed by two black curtains coming together before them, and which are opened at the a ppointed time. The Most Wise Master has before him a small low tab le covered with black, and on it, lighted, one wax candle, a Book of the Testimony, a compass and square, and a triple triangle; also the regalia for the candidate. By the table is a. low black seat or ottoman. The f urniture and properties are in disorder. A ewer, with water and napkins, should be placed in the Sou th.

FOURTH APARTMENT Which may very properly and advantageously be repre sented by a judicious rearrangement of the first apartment.

When a candidate is admitted he is called a probati oner or novice: when fully received he becomes a neophyte, or one newly born. The crux ansata in the East should be of gold. The labours are supp osed never to close, and when a Chapter is about to work, it is said the lab ours are resumed. The labours begin when the Word is lost, and are su spended when the Word is recovered. A novice must be subjected to three ballots.

My brother, you are still engaged as a Mason in sea rch of light and truth; of which search, the many journeys you have made in the different degree s are symbolical. But your search is not for the truth of any particular creed or religion-that search would be in vain, for what is truth to one i s not truth to another: often by argument and evidenc e, but almost always by the accidents of birth, education, and circumstances, our religious belief is formed; and argument and testimony strike the mind of man, when arrived at his religious cree d and faith, only to glance off and leave no impression. Our symbols and ceremonies envelop the great primit ive truths, known to the first men that lived: with whatever particular meaning they may have- pec uliar, or believed to be peculiar, to particular creeds, and differing, as the faith differs of thos e who receive them-we have nothing to do. We are about to conduct you through certain forms a nd ceremonies, to display to you certain symbols and emblems; we do not give you in advance their interpretation, but only indicate to you their general tendency; we place the thread in your hands that will guide you through the labyrinth; it is for you to apply and interpret the symbols and ceremonies of the degree in such manner as may seem to you truest and most appropria te. A vast multitude of men believe that the Redeemer o f man has already appeared upon the earth: many believe he was a man; many, the Son of God; an d many, the Deity incarnate: a vaster multitude still wait for the Redeemer: each will ap ply our symbols and ceremonies according, to his faith. PRAYER Great and dread Being, Father, who wast, when besid e thee there were time and space alone; a single thought of whom shaped itself into an univer se of suns and worlds, and infinite myriads upon myriads of living creatures; eternal as time a nd infinite as space; to whom all the past and all the future now is and ever will be present; tho u by whom no creature that lives is forgotten or unregarded, look with favor upon us and upon this o ur brother; deign to bless him, to protect him, and make his labours fortunate; watch over him; ill uminate his mind with wisdom, that he may understand our symbols; and teach him to trust in t hee. Amen! Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evi dence of things not seen. By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered his only-begotten son. B y faith the children of Israel forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; by faith, they passe d through the Red Sea as by dry land, which the Egyptians essaying to do, were drowned. By faith th e walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. Faith subdueth kingdoms , worketh righteousness, obtaineth promises, stoppeth the mouths of lions. By faith, a steady course we steer through ruffling storms and swelling seas; By faith, we pass the vale of te ars safe and secure, though oft distressed; By faith, subdue the king of fears, And go rejoicing t o our rest. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and w hose hope the Lord is : for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her r oots by the river.

My Brother, virtue and humility are the foundations of this degree; henceforward be you, therefore, virtuous, modest, and unpresuming; mark our guiding star of prudence, and so live that you may not disgrace or dishonor the name that you have earned, the characteristic to which you are entitled, and the jewel which you will hereafte r wear.

The Feast of Bread and Wine is to us the symbol of fraternity and affection, and of that perfect union which must ever exist among Knights of the Rose-Croix.

She invites all men of all religions to enlist under her banners, a nd to war against evil, ignorance, and wrong. You are now her knight, and to her service your swo rd is consecrated: may you prove a worthy soldier in a worthy cause, and may the great and Su preme Architect be always with you, and bless you with life ever-lasting.

HOLY THURSDAY, OR MAUNDAY THURSDAY DECORATIONS, ETC. A stated meeting of all Chapters Rose-Croix is held on Thursday before Easter: this meeting is indispensable. If a Rose-Croix Knight be necessaril y alone, he must, in spirit at least, feast that day with his brethren. A wreath must be placed upon the cross in the East. The Pelican feeding its young should be prominently displayed in the Ch apter-room upon a white column. Two additional yellow wax candles should be burning on the irregular throne in the East. The three columns, Faith, Hope, and Charity, should be displa yed in Position. The silver salver with Passover-bread and goblet of whitewine should also be provided. The altar should be plain and hung with black, with the Book of Constitutions, an d a square, compass, and Crux ansata of gold upon it. On the Crux ansata should be enamelled the letters. A little in front of the Master, on his right and l eft, are two triangular columns, draped in white, f ive feet in height. Upon each is a triangular transpare ncy, on one side of which is a word. This word, on the column on his right, is I.: on that on his l eft I.: In the West, a little in front of the Warde ns, on the right and left, are two columns, precisely a like, each with a similar transparency.

Amen! BRIEF OF ADDRESS From time immemorial, man has plighted his faith an d confidence in his fellow-man by drinking from the same cup and eating from the same loaf. Am ong Eastern nations at the present day has this method of solemnizing a pledge been retained. We learn from history, and our fathers of the Masonic faith, that in the ancient mysteries of Jud ea and Egypt, the newly initiated were presented with bread and wine as a symbol of the ne w life they were about entering upon, and that they were henceforth to be devoted to the laws of truth, and knowledge of their rights and duties. This ceremony is noted as having been practised in the mysteries of Judea and Eleusis, in their initiation to what they called the degree of Perfec tion. The Hebrews acquired the custom from the Egyptians, and celebrated their feasts of the Sprin g full moon, with bread and wine. With us it is simply a manifestation of fraternal love, as inculc ated by Charity and Masonic philosophy. The solemn feast of the Rose-Croix Knights is held this day, and commemorates the feast of the Passover, observed by the Jews. Respectable and Perfect Knights, the feast of which we are about to partake is thus ordered: \"On the 10th of the month of Nisan, they shall take to them every man a lamb, a lamb for a house; and if the household be too little for the l amb, let him and his neighbors next unto his house take it, according to the number of the souls . Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year and ye shall keep it up until the 14 th day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill i t in the evening: and they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and ye shall let not hing of it remain until the morning, nor break any bone of it; and that which remaineth of it until th e morning, ye shall burn with fire and thus shall y e Page 132 of 242"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes upon you r feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat in haste; it is the Lord's Passover. And this d ay shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall. keep it as a feast to the Lord throughout your gene rations, a feast by an ordinance forever.\" This feast, and the bread and wine of which we part ake, are to us symbols of fraternity and brotherly affection, and of that perfect union that must ever subsist among Brother Knights of the Rose- Croix. Thus, Brother Knights, are we assembled, solemnly a nd fraternally pledging ourselves one to another in brotherly love, in the presence of the a ngels and of that great Intelligence that surrounds us in our every action. We belong to no creed or school, but to universalit y, where Truth is the base and Morality the handmaid: we are Knights of Masonry, and to her ser vice our swords are consecrated: may we prove worthy soldiers in a worthy cause. The Most Wise then takes two cakes whole of the Pas sover-bread, and a broken one, in his hand together, and breaks the upper cake; but he must no t eat thereof till he breaks a piece off the broken one; then saying the correct word gives a pi ece of each to every one at the table. Both pieces are eaten together. After this commence s the general feast of the lamb and white wine. The Ceremony of Extinguishing the Lights will then proceed. CEREMONY OF EXTINGUISHING THE LIGHTS This ceremony takes place on every Thursday before Easter, after the Table Ceremony, and begins the moment the \"Word\" is returned to the Mos t Wise, and when all have resumed their positions. At the West end of the table is a candelabra with s even branches of unequal size, so as to form a triangle, the middle branch making the top of the t riangle. In each a yellow wax candle must be burning. All be ing around the table, at a sign from the Most Wise, the officers in reverse order proceed to perf orm their allotted tasks. Behold, the Emancipator of mankind, the friend of t he poor and destitute, the comforter, who, covering with the mantle of his word the nakedness of the lowest among the low, has introduced them into the Banquet-room of Immortality, there to enjoy the seat which has been from all eternity prepared for them by the Father. Guests of one day, and disinherited the next! the f riend is dead, the benefactor is no more! Woe unto us! Woe unto us! Woe unto us! Error, Error tri umphs, Truth has disappeared, ignorance has extinguished the light of philosophy. Thy fate is sealed, thou must die! and thy Knights will not be there to defend thee. Pray unto our Father to guide us in the arduous path of life, so that, when the last hour shall have come, we may rise to the bosom of our only friend, contempla te his beaming countenance, and enjoy forever the sublime lessons which he, no doubt, del ivers to the pure beings who surround him. \"Love ye each other.\" Page 133 of 242"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Close, as in the Table Ceremony, with the Benedicti on.

In the north is an eagle, hovering in the air; the squ are, compasses, trowel, and other Masonic emblems are scattered about, as also the cubical st one. The words Faith, Hope, Charity, and Truth will be displayed on a ribbon over this scene . CEREMONY-EASTER SUNDAY Proceed as on Holy Thursday till the time for the T HE ADDRESS, which may be delivered by the Most Wise, Orator, or such Brother Knight as may be selected for the special occasion. The Address should be brief, and explanatory of the joyful feast about to be partaken of, and at which greater license is given than on the Feast of Holy Thursday. The feast is not confined to any particular class of food, nor to white wine. Th e following hymn of praise may succeed the Address: HYMN. O God we lift our hearts to thee, and grateful voic es raise; We thank thee for this festive night, accept our humble praise.

May each unholy passion cease, each evil thought be crushed, each anxious care that mars our peace in Faith and Love be hushed. Oh! may we all in Truth abound, and Charity pursue; thus shall we be with glory crowned, and love as angels do.

LECTURE O.: My brother, the true Mason labours for the bene fit of those who come after him, as well as for the advancement and improvement of his race. That i s a poor ambition which contains itself within the limits of a single life. All men who des erve to live desire to survive their funerals, and to live afterward in the good that they have done mank ind, rather than in the marble of men's memories. Most men desire to leave some work behind them that may outlast their own day and generation: that is an instinctive impulse given by God, and is often found in the rudest human heart - the surest proof of the soul's immortality and of the fundamental difference between men and the wisest brutes. To plant the tree that, afte r we are dead, shall shelter our children, is as natural as to love the shade of those our fathers p lanted. The rudest unlettered husbandman, painfully conscious of his own inferiority, will to il and stint himself, to be enabled to educate his child, that he may walk in a higher sphere of usefu lness in this world. We build slowly and destroy swiftly. Our ancient br ethren who built the temples at Jerusalem, with myriad blows felled, hewed, and squared the cedars, and quarried the stones, and carved the intricate ornaments which were to compose the templ e: by stone after stone, with the combined efforts and long toil of Apprentices, Follow Crafts , and Masters, the walls arose; slowly the roof was framed and fashioned; and many years elapsed be fore at length the building stood finished, all fit and ready for the worship of God, gorgeous in the sunny splendors of Palestine. So they were built. A single motion of the arm of a rude, b arbarous Assyrian, or drunken Roman or legionary Goth of Titus, moved by a senseless impul se of the brutal will, flung in the blazing brand; and with no further human agency, a few shor t hours sufficed to consume and melt the temple to a smoking mass of black and unsightly rui n. Be patient, therefore, my brother, and wait. The is sues are with God, to do if right belongs to us. Therefore faint not, my brother, nor be weary in we ll-doing; be not discouraged at men's apathy, nor disgusted with their follies, nor tired of thei r indifference. Care not for returns and results, b ut see only what there is to do, and do it, leaving th e result to God.

THE APARTMENT, AND ITS DECORATIONS But one apartment is needed, and the assembly is st yled a Lodge; the hangings are blue and gold. In the East is a throne, ascended by nine ste ps, and is surmounted by a canopy. Over the East, lighting the Lodge, is a glory surrounding a triangle, in the centre of which are the words \"Fiat lux.\" In the centre of the room is the triang ular altar, on which rest a Bible, Square, Compass, Sword, and Mallet. The altar has three col umns about it, forming a triangle, on which are these words: on that in the East, \"TRUTH;\" on t hat in the West, \"JUSTICE;\" on that in the South, \"TOLERATION.\" The rough and smooth ashlars and working-tools of a Symbolic Lodge are disposed about the apartment. The Lodge is lighted by nine lights of y ellow wax, in a candlestick with nine branches, placed between the altar and the South; the lights are arranged in three triangles, one within the other.

It is unnecessary to sta te to you that its form relates to the fourth great light, which reminds us of the Deity and his attrib utes; the yellow relates to the superiority of the grade, while the blue border and lining is the embl em of Truth, which encompasses it; the triple triangle on the area exhibits the threefold power o f God, and their angles the nine great lights, with the initial letter of each 'm the respective c orners; the Tetragrammaton, crossed by the words, \" Fiat lux,,\" in the centre of the triangle, needs no explanation. The Cordon is yellow and blue, for reasons already set forth in describing the apron. The Jewel, also, is described by the representation on the area of the apron.

As the presiding officer of a Lodge, it will be your particular duty to dispense light and knowledge to the brethren. That duty is not perform ed - nor is that which the old charges require, that, at opening and closing, the Master shall give , or cause to be given a lecture, or part of a lecture, for the instruction of the brethren - by a sking and receiving the answers to three or four merely formal and trivial questions. On the contrar y, that duty is far higher and more important; and it behooves the Master to be prepared to perfor m it. Nor should any one accept the office of Master, until, by acquaintance and familiarity with the history, morals, and philosophy of Masonry, he is fitted to enlighten and instruct his brethren . That you may ever remember that duty, you will now, under the direction of the Senior Warden, proc eed symbolically to perform it, by restoring to us the splendor of our nine great lights in Masonry . LECTURE The true Mason, my brother, is a practical philosop her, who, under religious emblems, in all ages adopted by wisdom, builds, upon plans traced by nat ure and reason, the moral edifice of knowledge. Masonry and Philosophy, without being on e and the game thing, have the same object, and propose to themselves the same end - th e worship of the Great Architect of the Universe.

Eight hund red degrees of one kind and another were invented. Infidelity, Hermeticism, Jesuitry, were t aught under the mask of Masonry. The rituals of the regular Orders, copied and imita ted by ignorant men, became nonsensical and trivial. Candidates were made to degrade themselves , and to submit to insults not tolerable to a man of spirit and honour. It has even been seriousl y questioned whether, notwithstanding the beautiful order and systematic arrangement of the d egrees in the Ancient and Accepted rite - free as they are from all incongruities, and perfect as the lessons are in the teachings of the various virtues - the number might not advantageously have been reduced, and thus Masonry have been simplified. In the heterogeneous mass of over eight hundred deg rees called Masonry, was found Judaism and chivalry, superstition and philosophy, philanth ropy and insane hatred, a pure morality and unjust and illegal revenge, strongly mated, and sta nding hand in hand within the temples of peace and concord; and the whole system was one grotesque commingling of incongruous things and fine conceptions overlaid and disfigured by absurdi ties engendered by ignorance, fanaticism, and senseless mysticism. And empty and sterile pomp, with lofty titles arbit rarily assumed, and to which the inventors had not condescended to attach any explanation that sho uld acquit them of the folly of assuming temporal rank, power, and titles of nobility, made the world laugh and the initiate feel ashamed. Some titles we retain ; but they have with us meani ngs entirely consistent with the spirit of equality which is the foundation and peremptory law of its being - of all Masonry. The Knight, with us, is he who devotes his hand, his heart, his brai n to the science of Masonry, and professes himself the sworn soldier of Truth. The Prince is h e who aims to be chief (princeps) - first or leader - among his equals, in virtue and good deeds . The Sovereign is he who, one of an order whose members are all sovereigns, is supreme only b ecause the law and constitutions are so which he administers, and by which he, like every b rother, is governed. The titles, Puissant, Potent, Wise, and Venerable, indicate that power of virtue, intelligence, and wisdom, which those ought to strive to attain who are placed in high of fice by the suffrages of their brethren; and all ou r other titles and designations have an esoteric mean ing, consistent with modesty and equality, and which those, who receive them should fully unde rstand. As Master of a Lodge, it is your duty to instruct y our brethren that the degrees are all so many constant lessons, teaching the lofty qualifications which are required of those who claim them, and not merely idle gewgaws, worn in ridiculous imi tation of the times when the nobles and priests were masters, and the people slaves; and th at in all true Masonry, the Knight, the Pontiff, the Prince, and the Sovereign are but the first amo ng their equals; and the Cordon, the Clothing, and the Jewel, but symbols and emblems of the virtu es required of all good Masons. As Master of a Lodge, you will be exceedingly caref ul that no candidate, in any degree, be required to submit to any degradation whatever, as has been too much the custom in some of the degrees; and take it as a certain and inflexible ru le, to which there is no exception, that Masonry Page 148 of 242"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"requires of no man anything to which a knight and g entleman cannot honourably, and without feeling outraged or humiliated, submit.

To every Prussian Mason be it known notwithst anding the recent vengeance which the Deity had taken up mankind for their iniquities, by causing universal deluge notwithstanding the Deity had given the rainbow as a sign reconciliatio n, vouchsafing that favour declared that the world should not be again destroyed by waters, the descendants Noah, from their want of faith in the divine prediction, being apprehensive of a seco nd deluge, said,-Let us build a city whose top may reach the heavens, and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth. To accomplish their designs, they began to erect a high tower in plain of Shinar; but this enterprise being displeasing in the eye of their Ma ker, as tending to frustrate or delay the execution of his design, that mankind should not al ways continue together, he obliged them to discontinue the project, by confounding their langu age, so that one could not understand another. From this circumstance the city took its name of Ba bel, which signifies confusion; and a dispersion of the people and a planting of nations ensued. It was on the night of the full moon that the Lord worked this wonder, in remembrance of which, the Noahites hold their lodges at this season. The architect was named Peleg; at leas t, it was he who gave the idea of this building. As a punishment for his contumacy, and th e presumption of his brethren, he was deprived of his speech; and to avoid the outrages o f his companions, who considered him as the cause of the failure of their design, he travelled into countries remote from Shinar, and from thence, only by moonlight, as he was fearful of mas sacre if his person were recognised. His place of retirement was Prussia, where having, erec ted a triangular dwelling, he, by humiliation, and contrition for the part he had taken in the pla in of Shinar, obtained remission for his sins, and had his speech restored to him. This dwelling of Peleg's was discovered fifteen cub its deep from the surface of the earth, in the year 553. In it was found a stone of white marble, on which was inscribed the particulars I have related in the Hebrew tongue, and, adjacent was the following epitaph :.-Here repose the ashes of the grand architect of the tower of Babel.

So may it be turned aside from all his succes sors Lecture To be Delivered after the Ceremony, but before the Lodge is closed, for the instruction of the newly made Prussian Knight-Mason. The Knights of this Order originally united themsel ves together in the times of the Crusades; when, in consequence of the general disorder that p revailed all over Europe, and the multitude of estates and titles left to be disputed, wrong an d violence went unrebuked, and became superior to the law. Composed at first of a few Masons, who had learned the rules of justice from the teachings of the Order, they exerted only a moral influence, owi ng to the purity of their lives and the justice of their opinions. They called themselves Noachite Mas ons; because they strove to imitate the primeval justice and purity of the beloved Patriarc h. Finding that where their influence was most needed, mere advice and exhortation, addressed to t he rude Barons and haughty rapacious priesthood, had no effect, they assumed the power t o enforce performance of their judgments; and through the common people and a multitude of th e poorer Knights who had found the benefit of their protection, and who revered their justice, they found a ready means of compelling obedience and inflicting punishment. Their number w as limited, and their persons unknown. They met always at night, when the moon was full; a nd the more perfectly to remain unknown, allowed no light but hers. Lest their own members should become haughty and va in-glorious on account of the mysterious power they possessed, they inculcated humility, and incessantly reminded each other of that haughtiness and pride which led the descendants of Noah to erect the Tower of Babel; and of the miseries of Peleg, who suggested the idea of it s building, and who therefore condemned himself to a rigorous penitence, and buried himself in the vast solitudes of Northern Germany, in what is now the kingdom of Prussia, where he is sai d to have builded a temple in the shape of a Delta, and therein to have passed his life, implori ng the mercy of God. The Order was popularly known as the Holy Vehmne, a nd even kings trembled at its judgments. It continued to exercise its vast powers until law and civilization rendered them no longer necessary; but the Order still continued to exist, deciding Masonic controversies only and inflicting no other than Masonic punishments. As in time the Order came to flourish, particularly in Prussia, the members took the name of Prussian K nights. The Chapters of this degree are no longer tribunals to try and punish for offences committed without the limits of Masonry. They claim no jurisd iction except between their own members, and exercise none between those of the inferior degrees , except by their consent. And in all their judgments it is their rule and duty to judge of oth er men's motives and actions by the same rules by which they judge their own; to believe others eq ually as honest in their views as themselves; and to find for the conduct of others the same excu ses that they find for their own; for this alone is justice. And they prove their humility by their tolerance; which causes them to believe that their opinions are as likely to be erroneous as the opini ons of others to the contrary, and that the Deity alone knows what is truth. They meet only on the nights of the full moon, and allow no other light than hers, because such Page 156 of 242"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"was the ancient custom of the Order, derived from t he mysteries of Ceres and the old worship of Isis.

Amen ! HISTORY The Tsidunians or Phoenicians were ever ready to ai d the Israelites in their holy enterprises. The tie between them was the mysteries, into which the principal persons of both nations were initiated; Moses having necessarily received them i n Egypt, before he could marry the daughter of a priest of On. These mysteries, modified by Solomo n, or perhaps at an earlier day by Joshua, or even Moses, to suit the genius and manners of the J ewish people, became Masonry, such as it was practised at the building of the Temple, and su ch as it has in part come down to us. Khurum, King of Tsur, in Phoenicia, and Khurum Abai, also a Phoenician and not a Jew, were likewise initiates; and hence the intimate connection betwee n them and Solomon, as Masons. The people of Tsidun, a city of Phoenicia, were employed by No ah to cut cedars on Mount Libanus, of which Page 158 of 242"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"to build the ark, under the superintendence of Japh et. His descendants repeopled Tsidun and Phoenicia, and procured and furnished the cedar fro m Lebanon to build the Ark of the Covenant; and at a later day his posterity, under Adon Khurum , cut in the same forests cedars for King Solomon; and at a time, still later, they felled ti mber on the same mountains to construct the second temple. Upon the same mountain they established Colleges of Artificers, like those in Etruria, and afterward at Rome; from which latter many deduce Ma sonry. But the Etrurians, who emigrated from Assyria to Egypt and afterward to Etruria -bet ter known as the Hyksos, from Rosen on the Tigris, or as the Shepherd Kings-carried with them the same mysteries, which went also with them into Phoenicia; and the Etrurian and Roman Col leges were in all respects like those of Mount Libanus. These artificers everywhere adored t he Grand Architect of the Universe, and had their signs and words by which to recognise each ot her. Solomon himself, whose wisdom necessarily gave him a true idea of the dignity of labour, built a palace on the mountain, to which he often repaired to inspect the progress of the wo rk. The names of the Patriarchs who were the inspectors and conductors of the workmen on the mou ntain at different periods, are preserved in our passwords. The institution of Colleges upon Mou nt Libanus was perpetuated by the Druses, from whom the Crusaders obtained a knowledge of thi s degree. CLOSING ADDRESS When God in His eternal council conceived the thoug ht of Man's creation, He called to Him the three ministers that continually waited upon the th rone - Justice, Truth, and Mercy - and thus addressed them: 'Shall we make Man?' Justice answer ed: 'O God, make him not, he will trample on Thy laws;' and Truth also answered: 'O God, make him not, for he will pollute Thy sanctuaries.' But Mercy, dropping on her knees and looking up thr ough her tears, exclaimed: 'O my God, make him and I will watch over him with my care through the dark and dreary paths he will have to tread.'

The Tabernacle is also termed Mikdash, or Sanctuary. It was constructed of curtains, woven of fine thread, of white linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, embroidered with cherubin. The length of each curtain was twenty-three cubits or forty-two feet, and each was six feet in width. They were ten in number; and five of them were coupled or sewed toge ther in one piece, and five in another; and these two were so arranged that they could be faste ned together along their edges, by fifty loops on one edge of each, and fifty hooks of gold; so th at \"it should become one Tabernacle.\" Over this Tabernacle was a Tent [Ahel] or cover, of cloth of goats' hair, composed of eleven curtains, each thirty cubits or forty~five feet lon g, and six feet wide. Of these, five were coupled together in one piece, and six in another; and the two pieces were so arranged, with fifty loops on one edge of each, and fifty hooks of brass, that th ey could be fastened together, \" that it might be one.\" In the East, and especially in Arabia, customs and fashions have not changed; and the shape of the tent is now what it was in the days of Moses. T he shape of the tent is of an oblong, eight or ten feet high in the middle. It can vary in size, a nd have accordingly a greater or less number of poles to support it-from three to nine. And it is u sual for one large tent to be divided into two or more apartments by curtains, for the different port ions of the family. The tents of the Bedouins are not conical, as they are often represented in pictu res, but have a roof edged with drop-curtains, or such curtains as might be made from the dark tanned skins of-goats, hung around the eaves. Below is a drawing of a Bedouin tent.

Over this, hanging to the floor, on the North and South sides, and the re ar or West, and stretching on top, on each side, to and over the ridge pole, should be two curtains, joining together by hooks and loops in the middle of the rear, of white, blue, scarlet, and pu rple linen or cotton thread woven together, and embroidered with cherubim, or animals with the bodi es of lions, the feet of oxen, the faces of men, and the wings of eagles. Over this should be s imilar curtains of gray woollen stuff; and on top, as a covering red morocco, and over that, tann ed leather. The hanging curtain at the mouth of the tent, and t he veil dividing the Tabernacle into two parts, should be as above described; as also should the en closure of the Court, if not the fence. The furniture of the Court is as follows: In front of, and perhaps ten feet from the entrance of the Tabernacle, is the altar of sacrifice, made of white wood, hollow, and plated on top with brass. It is to be four and a half feet high, and seven and a half feet square, with projections in t he shape of tongues of flame (called horns in the Bible) at each corner, standing up-right. It is made to be carried by staves of light wood, banded with brass, passing through rings in two of the sides. Between this altar and the Tabernacle is a laver or large basin of bronze, with a foot to it, filled with water. In the front part of the tent, in front of the veil , on the North side, is the Table of the Presence o r Shew-bread. It is made of white wood, and is three and a half feet long, one and a half feet broad, and two and one-fourth feet high, the top covered w ith plates of brass, gilded, and with a gilded rim or border round its edge on the top. Below the top is a strip of wood four inches wide, with a similar rim or border round its lower edge. A littl e lower down, at equal distances from the top, is a ring, gold-plated, on each leg, through which gilde d staves pass to carry it. On this table are twelve small loaves of wheat brea d, in two piles of six each, sprinkled with frankincense and salt; and a large bowl of pure win e. On the south side of the tent, opposite the table, is the candelabrum, gilded, representing pure gold. It consists of an ornamented base, of a shaft rising out of it, and six arms, coming out by threes from two opposite sides of the shaft, each t wo arms equidistant from the central shaft, forming a semicircle, and all being in one line and of equal height or level on top. On the summit of the central shaft, and on those of the six arms, are lamps, not candles, all in globular shades, but the central one being much the largest. These l amps are to be fed with pure olive-oil.

In the centre of the inner portion of the tent (the Kadosh Kadoshim, or Holy of Holies,) stands the Ark of the Covenant, of wood, three and three-fourt h feet long, two and one-fourth feet broad, and two and one-fourth feet high, with short feet at ea ch corner. It is plated within and without with brass, so as to appear like pure gold, and has roun d, its upper edge a rim or cornice, gilded to represent gold. On the two longer sides, at the cor ners, are four brass rings, to receive the staves of wood, gilded, by which it is carried. On the Ark is a lid, called the Expiatory (or Mercy -Seat), as long and wide as the Ark, and representing solid gold. At each end is, also, as o f solid gold, a cherub, or winged figure of a female, each with two wings long enough to meet hal f-way between them, higher than their heads. Their heads should be bent down as though lo oking upon the Expiatory. On the altar of incense are the roll of the Book of the Law and a poniard; and on the Book of the Law, the Square and Compasses.

All except the first three officers are styled \"Worthy Levites .\" The presiding officer wears a robe or gown, of pure white linen, reaching to the feet, fitting close to the body, with loose sleeves coming as low as th e elbows - covering the shoulders, and closed round the neck. This is girded to the body, just un der the breast, by a girdle four fingers broad, wound round and round the body from the breasts to the navel, and the ends hanging down to the ankles. The robe is embroidered with needlework , in different colors; and the girdle is of loosely woven white cotton, embroidered with flower s of blue, scarlet, and purple. Over the robe or gown is the \" robe of the Ephod,\" an Egyptian tu nic of blue stuff, woven in one piece, with an aperture for the neck in the middle of it, and aper tures for the arms; without sleeves, large and loose, and reaching to the knees. Round the hem, at the bottom, is a fringe of blue, scarlet, and purple tassels, in the form of pomegranates, with a small gilded bell between each two; this is also tied round with a girdle, white, embroidered w ith blue, scarlet, and purple, and gold interwoven. He wears also the Ephod, a short cloak with the sle eves, of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen thread, embroidered richly, and covering the shoulders, by shoulder pieces that unite the back and front parts, which are separate. On each s houlder of it is an agate, set in gold, and each having upon it six names of the tribes, according t o precedence of birth. This Ephod has strings, that go out from each side, and tie to the body. He also wears the breastplate or gorget, ten inches square, of the same sort of cloth as the Ephod, doubled so as to form a kind of pouch, to ho ld the Aurim and Themim. On its outside are twelve precious stones, in four rows, as they are n amed in Exodus xviii. 17-20; on each side of which is engraved the name of one of the tribes. Th is is fastened to the front of the Ephod by means of dark blue ribbons, tied in four rings of g old at the corners of the breastplate, and four that meet them on the ephod itself . The rings at t he upper corners are on the inside of the breastplate, but those below are outside. There are also two other rings of gold, larger, at the Page 164 of 242"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"upper corners, on the outside, from which cords of twisted gold-thread reach and fasten to the agates on the shoulders.

The Urim or Aurim, and Thummim or Themim, carried i n the pouch or breastplate, are small images of sapphire (or blue stone), of Re and Thmei , Light and Truth, in a sitting posture, each holding the tau cross. The bonnet is a turban of fine white linen, circula r, covering half the head, something like a crown, of thick linen swathes doubled round many times, an d sewed together, surrounded by a linen cover, to hide the seams of the swathes. The mitre of the High-Priest is this turban, with another above it, of swathes of blue, embroidered, so that the whole is conical in shape. In front of the turban, on the forehead, is a plate of gold, extend ing from one ear to the other, fastened by strings tied behind, and also by a blue ribbon atta ched to the mitre; on which is engraved the inscription: \"HOLY TO THE LORD\" The two Wardens wear the same dress in all respects , except the breastplate, and the mitre, instead of which they wear the bonnet or turban of white linen. The High-Priest and Wardens wear no apron. The othe r officers and members wear a white apron, lined with scarlet, and bordered with red, b lue, and purple ribbons. In the middle is painted or embroidered the g olden candelabrum with seven l ights. They also wear a red leather belt, fringed along th e lower edge with gold, and edged with gold; from which hangs a small silver censer, or ornament ed cup, with a long handle, the end whereof, on which the cup sits, in shaped like an open hand. This is also the form of the jewel of the degree. For receptions there is also a dark apartment, with an altar in the centre, on which are placed a feeble light and three skulls. In front of the alta r is a skeleton. Battery - ** - ** - ** - * RECEPTION 1. Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and t ell the children of Israel: Ye have seen what I did unto the Mitzrayim, and how I bare you on the w ings of eagles, and brought you unto myself. 2.

LECTURE H.: P.: I accept and receive you, my brother, as a Levite and Chief of the Tabernacle, and consecrate and devote you henceforth to the service of the children of light; and I now invest you with the belt, jewel, and apron of this degree. The jewel, or censor is of silver, is ever to remind you to offer up unceasingly to God the incense of g ood deeds and charitable actions, dictated by a pure and upright heart. Josephus tells that the mixture of materials, in th e curtains of the Tabernacle, and the clothing of the priests, was not without design. \"It served,\" h e says, \"as a symbol of the universe. For the scarlet seemed emblematical of fire; the fine linen , of the earth; the blue, of the air; and the purple, of the sea; two of them being thus compared for their colour: the fine linen and the purple on account of their origin, as the earth produces t he one, and the sea the other.\" To us, in this degree, the white of the apron, its principal and chief colour, is symbolical of the infinite beneficence of God; the blue, of His profo und and perfect wisdom; the crimson, of His glory; and the purple, of His power. The candelabrum with seven branches, upon the apron , wrought in gold, represents to us, as it represented to our ancient Hebrew brethren, what we re known in the earlier ages as the seven planets, or principal heavenly bodies: the Sun in t he middle, with Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn on one side, and Venus, Mercury, and the Moon on the o ther. It also represents the seven archangels whom the Hebrews assigned to the governm ent of those planets; Zerakhi-el, the Dawn, or Rising of God, to the Sun; Auri-el, the Li ght of God, to Mars; Gabari-el, the Strength of God, to Jupiter: Mayak-el, the Semblance of God, to Saturn; Khamali-el, the Mercy of God, to Venus; Raph-el, the Healing of God, to Mercury; and Tsaph-el , the Messenger of God, to the Moon: of whom Mayak-el, or Michael, was represented with the head of a lion; Auri-el, or Uriel, with that of an ox; Raph-el, or Raphael, with a hum an head and the body of a serpent; and Gabari-el, or Gabriel with that of an eagle; and al l of the seven being attributes and manifestations of El, the great Semitic Nature-God of the ancient Patriarchs; as to whom, and these planets, and angels, and their connection wit h Masonry you will be more fully instructed as you advance The number 7 is the sacred number in all theogies a nd in all symbolisms. It is the spirit, assisted by all the elementary powers; the soul, served by n ature ; the Holy Empire ( Sanctum Regnum ), spoken of in the clavicules of Solomon. It reappear s everywhere in the Hebrew writings and in the Apocalypse; and here, particularly, in the seven la mps of the candelabrum. Under the symbols of the seven planets which it represents, the ancients figured the seven virtues so peculiarly Masonic: Faith, that aspiration toward the infinite, was rep resented by the Sun; Hope by the Moon; Charity, by Venus; Force (or Fortitude), always victor over rage and anger, by Mars; Prudence, by Mercury; Temperance, by Saturn; and Justice, by Jup iter (Tsadue, the Just), conqueror of the Titans.

These forces, analogous and contrary the one to the other , by their counter-action, produce the equilibrium, and regulate the movements of the sphe res. The Hebrews called them the Seven Great Archangels. The seven planets correspond with the seven colors of the prism, and the seven notes of the musical octave. The seven sacram ents are also referred to in this great universal number of the Master Mason. PRINCE OF THE TABERNACLE The Twenty-Fourth Grade of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite and the Sixth Degree of the Historical and Philosophical Series ARGUMENT The degree of Prince of the Tabernacle illustrates the ceremonies of the Priests in the ancient Temples, and explains the esoteric meaning of their many avocations in equipping the Temple and sustaining their various sacerdotal duties. Thi s degree is most intimately connected with, and should be considered a continuation of, that of the Chief of the Tabernacle. The especial duties of a Prince of the Tabernacle are to labour incessantl y for the glory of God, the honour of his country, and the happiness of his brethren; to offe r up thanks and prayers to the Deity in lieu of sacrifices of flesh and blood.

RECEPTION My brother, the initiate is he who possesses the la mp, the cloak, and the staff. The lamp is reason enlightened by science; the cloa k is liberty, or the full and entire possession of one's self, which isolates the sage from the cur rents of instinct; and the staff is the assistance of the occult and eternal forces of nature. The lamp lights the past, the present, and the futu re, which are the three sides of the triangle. It burns with a threefold flame; the cloak is in three folds; and the staff is divided into three parts. This number, nine, is that of the reflexes of the D eity, and expresses the divine idea in all its abstract power. Hence it is sacred in Masonry. For that it was that Hermes made it the number of initiation; because the initiate reigns over supers tition, and by superstition, and can walk alone in the darkness, supported as he is upon his staff, wr apped in his cloak, and lighted by his lamp. Page 170 of 242"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Reason has been given unto all men; but all do not know how to use it. That is a science that must be learned. Liberty is offered to all; but all have not the power to be free. That is a right which we must conquer. Force is within the reach of all men; but all men do not know how to lean upon it. That is a power of which one must possess himself. These are to us, in this degree, the three great li ghts on the east, west, and south of the altar. To attain the Holy Empire, that is to say, the scie nce and power of the Magi, four things are indispensable: an intellect enlightened by study; a n audacity which nothing checks a will that nothing can conquer; and a discretion that nothing can corrupt or intoxicate. To Know, to Dare, to Will, to be Silent - these are the four words of th e Magus, written in the four symbolic forms of the sphinx. All the phenomena of nature depend on one single im mutable law, represented by that symbolic form, the cube; and this furnished the Hebrews with all the mysteries of the divine tetragram. Take care that thou dost not mistake the shadow for the reality. In everything, the vulgar habitually do so. They turn from the light, and won der at the obscurity which they themselves project. Listen and learn. Interpret our symbols for yoursel f. In every rough ashlar of marble is hidden the perfect cube. One is the symbol, the other its mean ing. The sun and moon in our lodges are the truth, and the reflection of the truth in doctrine. Allegory, the mother of all dogmas, is the substitution of the impression for the seal, of the shadow for the reality. It is the falsehood of the truth, and the truth of the falsehood. A dogma is not invented; a truth is veiled and a sh adow produced, to suit weak eyes. The initiator is not an impostor, but a revealer - that is, in th e original meaning of the word, one who veils anew. He is the creator of a new shadow. The work of God is the book of God. For the letters to appear, there must needs be two colours on the page. Search and discover. You are about to be taught by symbols. Forget not the universal law of equilibrium. The ancients, in thei r evocations, always erected two altars, and sacrificed two victims, one black and one white; an d the Priest, holding in one hand the sword, and in the other the rod, had to have one foot nake d and the other shod. Prepare, now, for admission to the inner mysteries. M.:. P.: My brethren, the power of darkness has pr evailed over the Prince of light. The earth mourns, and is wrinkled with frost.

The Chaldea ns lament for Bel, and the Phoenicians for Thammuz. The Phrygian women clash their cymbals and weep for Atys; on the Syrian hills and over the Etruscan plains the virgins lament for Dio nusos; while far in India the Brahmans pray for the return of Cama; and in Persia the Magi predict the resurrection of Mithras. The dead will rise again, as the wheat grows from the grain ; and all the world will then rejoice. M.: P.: We, like our ancient masters, mourn Osiris - the type to us of the sun, of light, of life.

Battery - ***** - *** - * RECEPTION So much of the truth as it is given to mortals to k now, is within the reach of those alone whose intellects are unclouded by passion or excess. To a ttain it, to comprehend the delicate distinctions of the thought in which the truth is embodied, the intellect, like a keen instrument of the finest steel, must be able to dissect the thought, and dis tinguish one from the other its invisible nerves. The edge of the instrument is blunted by the indulg ence of the sensual appetites, or of the intemperate passions of the soul. Therefore it is that the sages have always required of those who sought to scale the heights of philosophy a preparatory discipline, of long-contin ued temperance and self-restraint; and fasting is enjoined, as well as prayer. If thy intellect is dull and coarse by nature, or c louded and confused by indulgence, the symbolisms of the Kabala will have no meaning to th ee; and we shall address thee in a foreign tongue. Thus it is that true Masonry has always been, and a lways must be, confined to a few; since to the mass its truths are foolishness and valueless.

There is no bread nor any water, and our souls loathe this light manna. We go to and fro these forty year s; and as Aaron died in the desert, so also shall we all die here. Let us put trust in Adonai no long er; but let us call on the great gods Amun and Astarte, Osiris and Isis, to deliver us from this m isery.\" And as they cried aloud on them, lo! Adonai sent fiery serpents among them, by whom much people hath died. And those that remain have repented and, said unto me: \"Put chains upon t hy neck in token of our penitence, and go unto Moses our leader, and beseech him to pray unto Adonai that he take away the serpents from us;\"' and I have done as they desired. My brother, life is a war, in which one must prove his soldiership, in order to rise in rank. Force is not given. It has to be seized. He only is worthy of initiation in the profounder m ysteries who has overcome the fear of death, and is ready to hazard his life when the welfare of his country or the interests of humanity require it; and to die even an ignoble death, if thereby th e people may be benefited. I have prayed for the people, and Adonai hath said unto me: \"Make thee an image of a venomous springing serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it s hall come to pass that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.\" The plague of serpents is stayed; and as they have fled to their caves, so the celestial serpent flees, with the scorpion, before the glittering sta rs of Orion. The great festival of the vernal equinox approaches, and it is time to prepare ourse lves by purification for the Passover. Light will soon prevail once, more over darkness; and the puls es. of life again beat in the bosom of the earth, long chilled by the wintry frosts. Let the brazen cross and the serpent be borne befor e the congregation, and be forever a symbol of Faith, by the dying out whereof in the hearts of nations, they fall into decay; and lest the knowledge of its true symbolic meaning should in ti me be lost, and the people hereafter imagine it to be something divine, and worship it, we will per petuate the remembrance of this day's events, and the true meaning of this and our other symbols, and of the fables of Osiris and Ormuzd, and Typhon and Ahriman, as the last degree of those sac red mysteries which Joseph, the son of Jacob, like myself, learned from the Egyptians, and which I have taught to you such as our forefathers practised on the plains of Chaldaea. The Father sends fiery serpents to sting and slay h is children. Yet he commands us to forgive those who trespass against us. And this law is not the mandate of his will, but the expression of his nature. Who will explain this great mystery? Below, upon the earth, the serpent is the minister of death. Its image, lifted on high, heals and restores life. The first sages who sought for the cause of causes saw good and evil in the world; they observed the shadow and the light; they compared winter with spring, old age with youth, life with death, and said: \"The first cause is beneficent and cruel. It gives life hnd destroys.\" Are there, then, two contrary principles - a good a nd an evil?\" cried the disciples of Manes. No! the two principles of the universal equilibrium are not contrary to each other, though in apparent opposition; for it is a single wisdom that opposes them one to the other.

The canopy over the throne is green, white, and red; and befor e the throne is a table, covered with a cloth of the same colors. Over the throne hangs a triple int erlaced triangle of broad bars, two of which are white, and one black; and in its centre the letter yod . Instead of a gavel, the presiding officer uses an arrow, the plume of which is red on one side and green on the other, the spear white, and the point gilded. By the altar is a statue or statuette of white marb le, the naked figure of a virgin. Over it is a drapery of thin white gauze. This represents Truth, and is the palladium of the Order of Princes of Mercy. The altar, placed in the centre of the room, is of a triangular shape, each side measuring 18 inches, and its height being 36 inches. The top is a plate, like gold, on which, formed of different colored stones, is the word HoLaTal ; and under that a passion cross, on either side of which, above the arms, are the Greek letters Alpha and Ome ga.

Or.: Thus said the holy books of ancient India: Th ere are three supreme gods, the three forms and aspects of the first, the supreme, single, invi sible God, cause of all phenomena, and soul of the world: and these three, the powers of creation, preservation, and destruction, distinct in persons, are but one God, the triple form of the Su preme, the word A.: U.: M.:, first utterance of the Eternal. J.: W.: Said the ancient Hindoos: Chrishna, the sec ond person of the Trimourti, born of a royal virgin, without sin, descended into hell, arose aga in, and ascended to heaven. He will appear again at the end of the world, will become man, and mounted on a white horse, with a sword glittering like a comet, will traverse the world an d destroy the guilty. The great serpent shall consume the universe; but the, seeds of creation sh all be preserved in the lotus; and a new creation shall commence. S.: W.: Above all existences, said the ancient Boud dhists, is the spirit, universal, indestructible, who during incalculable time preserves all that is, and remains in repose, until the laws of destiny oblige him to create new worlds. From him flow the Bouddhas, each a trinity of intelligence, law, Page 178 of 242"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"and unison, each a Redeemer. The stars shall salute him at his nativity, and all mankind unite in orisons to God. M.: E.: From the supreme divinity and ancient unlim ited time, said the old Persians, emanated the pure light. He will in the fourth age create Sosios ch the Saviour, who shall prepare the human race for the general resurrection. Or.: Mithra, it was said in the ancient Sabean Myst eries, is the Grand Architect of the universe himself, appearing in visible shape, the spirit of the sun and light, the eye of Ormuzd. He is three and one; for his essence illuminates, warms, and ma kes fruitful at once. He is the incarnate mediator, bringing back souls to God. J.: W.: The Supreme God Alfader, said our ancient b rethren the Druids, is eternal. He made heaven, earth, and air, and men, and gave to men im mortal souls. S.: W.: Amun-Re, said the ancient Egyptians, the un created, is the Supreme Triad, father, mother, and son, from whom the long chain of Triads descends to the incarnations in human form. Osiris, final conqueror of Typhon, shall sit in judgment on all the dead, and pronounce the final sentence, on each according to his deserts. M.: E.: He, said the Hebrew Kabalists, is the Supre me, the hidden lamp, whereof is no cognition. He is found to have three heads, contained in one h ead. Wisdom is the father, and intelligence the mother, and from them flows truth. These three are - Chochmah, wisdom; Binah, the mother of understanding; and Daath, intellectual cognition . Or.: Again, hear ye! In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God: all things were made by him: in him was li fe, and that life was the light of mankind; the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh in to the world. And the Word became incarnate, and dwelt among men, and they beheld his glory, the glory of the first-born of the Father. Thus said the ancient Christian Masons; and they said al so: There are three that bear record in heaven; the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one. J.: W.: Thus in all ages the golden threads of trut h have gleamed in the woof of error. Fortunate the Mason who, by the light of wisdom, the true Mas onic light, second emanation from the Deity, can discern the golden threads, God's hieroglyphics , written when time began; and read them aright, as they were read by our ancient brethren i n the early ages! S.: W.: Thus in all ages the word of God, his thoug ht, not uttered in a voice audible to mortal ears, has spoken in the souls of men, and taught them the great truths of reason, philosophy, and religion. Fortunate the Mason to whom that word, th e Deity manifest, is audible, intelligible, significant; God's thought, that made the stars and all that is, and the great laws of harmony and motion! M.: E.:. Thus in all ages rosy gleams of light, pie rcing the dark clouds of error, have taught mankind that truth and light, perfect and glorious, linger below the horizon, in time to rise to fill God's universe with light and glory, at the dawn of his promised day. Fortunate the Mason, who with firm faith and hope accepts these struggling r ays that gild the clouds, as ample evidence that in God's good time his dawn of day will come, and b e eternal.

M.: E.: My brother, you have ascended too high in M asonry to be longer subjected to physical tests and trials, or you would again in this degree have represented the Fellow Craft, or Companion, advancing toward the Master's degree. In the early days of Christianity, there was an ini tiation like those of the Pagans. Persons were admitted on special conditions only. To arrive at a complete knowledge of the doctrine, they had to pass three degrees of instruction. The initiates were consequently divided into three classes: the first, auditors, the second, catechumens, and t he third the faithful. The auditors were novices, prepared by ceremonies and instruction to receive t he dogmas of Christianity. A portion of these dogmas was made known to the Catechumens; who, afte r particular purifications, received baptism, or the initiation of the theogenesis (divi ne generation); but in the grand mysteries of that religion, the incarnation, nativity, passion, and r esurrection of Christ, none were initiated but the faithful. These doctrines, and the celebration of t he holy sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, were kept with profound secrecy. To avoid persecution, the early Christians were com pelled to use great precaution, and to hold meetings of the faithful [of the household of faith ] in private places, under concealment by darkness. They assembled in the night, and they gua rded against the intrusion of false brethren and Profane persons, spies, who might cause their a rrest, During the early persecutions they took refuge in the vast catacombs which stretched for mi les in every direction under the city of Rome, and are supposed to have been of Etruscan origin. T here, amid labyrinthine windings, deep caverns, hidden chambers, chapels and tombs, the pe rsecuted fugitives found refuge, and there they performed the the ceremonies of the mysteries. They conversed together figuratively and by the use of symbols; and those who were initiated were bound by solemn promise not to disclose or eve n converse about the secrets of the mysteries, except with such as had received them un der the same sanction. Page 180 of 242"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"This then is the history of the suffering of Jesus the Christ, and its Masonic application as made by the Christian Mason. Some of the ceremonies of t he first three degrees, which, whatever your faith, may not be uninteresting to you, since you a re in no wise required to receive them as correct, are as follows: M.: E.: Behold, the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. My brother, you have before this been brought to light in Masonry, when the Wor shipful Master, with the aid of the brethren, first made you a Mason. You have been taught to bel ieve in the true God. You have passed through degrees intended to remind you of the Essen ian and Hebrew mysteries; and in this you have heard described those practised by the first C hristians. As you were not required to profess a belief in the tenets of the Essenes or the Pharis ees, so neither here are you required to believe in the divine mission or character of Jesus the Naz arine. We shadow forth the secret discipline of the early Christians, as we do the other Mysteries, as the diverse and often eccentric forms in which Masonry has developed itself in the different ages of the world. Masonically, we know not whether you be Christian, Jew, or Moslem. If you be Christian, you will see in this degree a Christian ceremony; and so you have the right to interpret it. Your brethren will respect your faith , as they have a right to demand that you shall respect theirs. If you be not a Christian, you will see in it a mere historical allegory, symbolizing great truths, acknowledged alike by you and them. While you were veiled in darkness, you heard repeat ed by the voice of the great past its most ancient doctrines. No one has the right to object, if the Christian Mason sees foreshadowed in Chrishna and Sosiosch, in Mithras and Osiris, the d ivine Word, that, as he believes, became man, and died upon the cross to redeem a fallen rac e. Nor can he object if others see in the Word that was in the beginning with God, and that was Go d, only the logos of Plato and Philo, or the uttered thought or first emanation of light, or the reason, of the great, silent, uncreated Deity, believed in and adored by all. We do not undervalue the importance of any truth. W e utter no word that can be deemed irreverent by any one of any faith. We do not tell the Moslem that it is only important for him to believe that there is but one God, and wholly uness ential whether Mahomet was his prophet. We do not tell the Hebrew that the Messiah, whom he ex pects, was born in Bethlehem nearly two thousand years ago; and as little do we tell the Ch ristian that Jesus the Nazarine was but a man, or his history the revival of an older legend. To d o either is beyond our jurisdiction. Masonry, of no one age, belongs to all time; of no one religion, i t finds its great truths in all. Masonry is a worship; but one in which all civilize d men can unite. It trusts in God, and hopes; it believes, like a child, and is humble. It draws no sword to compel others to adopt its belief, or to be happy with its hopes. And it waits with patience to understand the mysteries of nature hereafter. The greatest mysteries in the universe are those wh ich are ever going on around us; so trite and common to us that we never note them or reflect upo n them. There are other forces in the universe than those that are mechanical. Here are two minute seeds, not much unlike in appea rance, and two of larger size. Hand them to Chemistry, which tells us how combustion goes on in the lungs, and plants are fed with phosphorus and carbon, and the alkalies and silex. Let it decompose them, analyze them, torture them in All the ways it knows. The net result of ea ch is a little sugar, a little fibrin, a little wat er- carbon, potassium, sodium, and the like - one cares not to know what. We hide them in the ground; and the slight rains mo isten them, and the sun shines upon them, and little slender shoots spring up and grow; and w hat a miracle is the mere growth! the force, the Page 181 of 242"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"power, the capacity, by which the little feeble sho ot, that a small worm can nip off with a single snap of its mandibles, extracts from the earth and air and water the different elements with which it increases in stature, and rises imperceptibly to ward the sky! One grows to be a slender, feeble stalk, like an or dinary weed; another a strong bush, armed with thorns, and sturdy enough to bid defiance to the wi nds; the third a tender tree, subject to be blighted by the frost, and looked down upon by all the forest; while another spreads its rugged arms abroad, and cares for neither frost nor ice, n or the snows that for months lie heaped around its roots. But lo! out of the brown foul earth, and colourless invisible air, and limpid rain-water, the chemistry of the seeds has extracted colours-four d ifferent shades of green, that paint the leaves, which put forth in the spring upon our plant, our s hrub, and our trees. Later still come the flowers- the vivid colours of the rose, the beautiful brilli ance of the carnation, the modest blush of the apple, and the splendid white of the orange. Whence come these colours? By what process of chemistry are they extracted from the carbon, the p hosphorus, and the lime? Is it any greater miracle to make something out of nothing? Pluck the flowers. Inhale the delicious perfumes, e ach perfect and all delicious. Whence have they come? By what combination of acids and alkalis could the chemist produce them? And the fruit - the ruddy apple and the golden orange - the texture and fabric how totally different! the taste how entirely dissimilar! the perfume of each distinct from its flower, and from the other. Whence the taste and this new perfume? The same ear th and air and water have been made to furnish a different taste to each fruit, a differen t perfume not only to each fruit, but to each fruit and its own flower. Is it any more a problem whence come thought and wi ll and perception, and all the phenomena of the mind, than this, whence come the colours, the p erfumes, the taste of the fruit and flower ? And lo! in each fruit new seeds, each gifted with t he same wondrous power of reproduction - each with the same wondrous forces wrapped up in it to b e again in turn evolved; - forces, that had lived three thousand years in the grain of wheat fo und in the wrappings of an Egyptian mummy; forces, of which learning, and science, and wisdom know no more than they do of the nature and laws of action of God. What can we know of the natu re, and how can we understand the powers and mode of operation, of the human soul, when the glossy leaves, the pearl-white flower, and the golden fruit of the orange are miracles wholly. beyond our comprehension? We but hide our ignorance in a cloud of words; and the words too often are mere combinations of sounds without any meaning. What force draws the needle toward the north? What force moves the muscle that raises the arm, when the will determines it shall rise? Whence come s the will itself ? Is it spontaneous - a first cause, or an effect? These too are miracles, inexpl icable as the creation, or the self-existence of God. On being now again brought to light, you see upon t he altar before you the luminous delta, with three equal sides, in all ages the representation o f Deity, the trinity of wisdom, power, and harmony; and upon it the ineffable name, and the cr oss, in all time the emblem of eternity. M.: E.: My brother, the colours of this degree are green, red, and white. They symbolise the Masonic trinity. The green is an emblem of the infi nite wisdom; the red, of the supreme energy, force, or power; and the white, produced by minglin g all the colours, of the divine harmony.

HISTORY When St. Jean d'Acre, the ancient Ptolemais, on the southern side of which was Mount Carmel, was besieged by the Christian forces, for nearly tw o years, under Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat, and other princes and leaders from every country in Europe, - and especially by Henry VI. of Germany, s on of Frederich Barbarossa, joined, near the end of the siege, by Philip Augustus of France and Richard Coeur de Lion of England, - they were long afflicted with famine, until they ate the fles h of horses with joy, and even the intestines sold Page 187 of 242"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"for ten sous; men of high rank, and the sons of gre at men, greedily devoured grass; the starving fought together like dogs for the little bread bake d at the ovens; they gnawed the bones that had already been gnawed by the dogs; and noblemen, asha med to beg, were known to steal bread. Sickness, also, caused by the rains and the intense heat, decimated the Christian forces. The wounded German soldiers, whom none of the others un derstood, could not make known their sickness nor their necessities. Certain German nobl es from the cities of Bremen and Lubee, who had arrived at Acre by sea, moved by the miseries o f their countrymen, took the sails of their ships, and made them a large tent, in which for a t ime they placed the wounded Germans, and tended them with great kindness. Forty nobles of the same nation united with them, a nd established a kind of hospital in the midst of the camp; and this noble and charitable associat ion, like the Knights of the Temple and of St. John of Jerusalem, soon and insensibly became a new Hospitaller and Military Order. This was in the year 1191. In 1192, Pope Celestin III., at the request of the Emperor Henry VI., solemnly approved of the Order, by his bull of the 23d of Fe bruary. He prescribed, as regulations for the new Knights, those of St. Augustine; and for specia l statutes, in all that regarded the poor and the sick, those of the Hospitallers of St. John; in reg ard to military discipline the regulations of the Templars. This Order, exclusively composed of Germa ns, was styled \" The Order of Teutonic Knights of the House ol St. Mary of Jerusalem ;\" as the Templars were styled, \"of the House of the Temple at Jerusalem.\" A great number of noblemen, who had followed that P rince (Frederic of Suabia, second son of the Emperor) to Acre as volunteers, some actuated b y religious enthusiasm, and some by the desire of glory, joined the soldiers of the Temple and of the Hospital, or engaged in attending on the wounded and caring for the sick of their nation . This was the origin of the Teutonic Order, the first branch of that of the Templars. The chiefs, desiring to advance these pious gentlem en and to gratify the German nation, proposed to them the institution of a new Order of Chivalry, to be at once hospitaller and military. Forty German lords, distinguished by their nobility ; and feats of arms, agreed to these, and became the Founders and original members of the Ord er. On entering the Order, they bound themselves by the three solemn vows, and also oblig ed themselves to serve the poor, in imitation of the Hospitallers, and to follow the claustral an d military discipline of the Templars, in peace as well as in war. Their title of Knights of the House of St. Mary of Jerusalem was given them, because while, the city of Jerusalem was under the government of the L atin Christians, a German had erected there, at his own expense, a hospital and oratory for the sick of his nation, under the protection of, and dedicated to, the Virgin Mary. To distinguish this Order from the other two, they adopted the black cross. It is ordinarily said that they also adopted the white mantle; but about the y ear 1210, the Templars of Palestine complained to Pope Innocent, that after they had re ceived from the Holy See the white mantle as the distinctive dress of their Order, the Teutonic Knights, and especially those of St. Jean d'Acre, had assumed to wear it. Innocent wrote to the latter, and to their Grand Ma ster, Herman Bart, a gentleman of Holstein, and directed that, in order to avoid all occasion f or jealousy or quarrel, they should content themselves with their ordinary dress, and leave the white colour to the Templars; and at the same time he ordered the Patriarch of Jerusalem to see t o it that the Teutonic Knights should follow their first custom, and to censure, and so compel t hem to do it, if necessary. Page 188 of 242"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"It is true that they paid little regard to the mand ate of the Pope, and soon adopted the white mantle again; but it was not their primitive dress; and therefore we, in this degree, wear a different colour. The leading objects of the three great military ord ers were the same. The Teutonic Knights soon rivalled the other orders in numbers and influence. In the year 1226, most of the Teutonic Knights went from the Holy Land to Prussia; the people of which were still idolaters, waging cruel war agains t their Christian neighbors, murdering priests at the foot of the altar, and employing the sacred ves sels for profane uses. For many years the Teutonic Knights held Prussia as a fief depending on the crown of Poland. After the Order of the Temple had been \"suppressed, extinguished, and abolished,\" in the year 1312, by the papal bull of the 6th May of that year , by which all persons were forbidden to enter the Order, or to assume the name of Templars, or to wear their dress, under pain of excommunication, an extension of the same, in the s ame year, adjudged all the Property and estates of the Templars to the Knights of Rhodes (o f St. John, or the Hospitallers, afterward Knights of Malta), except such as were in the realm s of Spain, and without prejudice to the right of any kings, princes, or lords to any property of the Order in other countries. A Knight Commander of the Temple should have five e xcellent qualities, which are represented by the five lights that form the symbolic cross upo n our table, - Humility, Temperance, Chastity, Generosity, and Honour. KNIGHT OF THE SUN OR PRINCE ADEPT THE TWENTY-EIGHTH GRADE OF THE ANCIENT AND ACCEPTED SCOTTISH RITE, AND THE TENTH DEGREE OF THE HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL SERIES. Page 189 of 242"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"ARGUMENT. There is but one God, uncreated, eternal, infinite, and Inaccessible: that the soul of man is immortal, and his existent life but a point in the centre of eternity: that harmony is in equilibrium, and equilibrium subsists by the analogy of contrari es: that analogy is the key of all the secrets of nature, and the sole reason of being of all revelat ions: and, finally, that the Absolute is Reason, which exists through itself: that evil, and wrong, and misery are the necessary discords that unite with the concords of the universe to make one great harmony forever. Such is the argument of this the last philosophical degree of the Ancient a nd Accepted Scottish Rite; its doctrine is derived from the Kabala, and is the same as that of the Her metic philosophers who wrote on Alchemy. Nature is revelation, and the light of truth shines everywhere in the world, Magism was made for kings and priests alone. He who dreads to lose his own ideas, and fears new truths, and is not disposed to doubt everything, rather than admit any thing at random, should not seek to learn the teaching of this degree, for they will be useless a nd dangerous to him; he will misunderstand them and be troubled by them, and yet be more troub led should he chance to comprehend them. He who prefers anything to reason, truth, and justi ce, whose will is uncertain and wavering, who is alarmed by logic and the naked truth, should not rashly engage in the pursuit of the high sciences; but once on the road, he must reach the g oal or perish; to doubt is to become insane, to halt is to fall, to back is to precipitate one's self into an abyss. Sancta Sancis! The holy things for the holy! SANCTO : SANCO: SEMONI - DEO FIDIO SACRUM' In the Veda there are only three deities Dyaus in h eaven, Indra in the sky, and Agni on the earth. Dyaus, Indra, Agni, however, are but manifestations in the Sun, the bright Sky, and the Fire derived from the solar light. In the Vedic hymns, w e find perpetual allusion to the sun with his life- bestowing rays. The Persians, the Assyrians, the Ch aldeans, all worship the sun. Sun worship was introduced into the mysteries not as a material idolatry, but as the means of expressing an idea of restoration to life from death, drawn from the daily reappearance in the cast of the solar orb after its nightly disappearance in the west. The Sun is the symbol of sovereignty, the hieroglyp hic of royalty; it doth signify absolute authority. Sol is the fire of heaven which lights the generati ve fires of earth, the genial parent who renews in its season all nature, and gives fertility to both animal and vegetable creation, and which, therefore, came to be worshipped as the giver of pr ocreative power. As men are, so will their ideas of God be; each one, according to his cultiva tion and idiosyncrasies, projects on his mental canvas the highest ideal of the Illimitable of whic h he is capable. Had man worshipped nought less noble and elevating than the Sun he would have done well; for he could adore nothing greater save the Supreme Creator of the Sun. THE COUNCIL-CHAMBER-ITS FURNITURE, ETC. Bodies of this degree are styled Councils. Each Cou ncil consists of not less than ten members. The hangings of the Council-Chamber should represen t the open country-mountains, plains, forests, and fields. The chamber is lighted by a si ngle light. This is a great globe, suspended in the South, and represents the sun. The only additio nal light is from the transparencies. In the East is suspended a transparency, displaying the sign of the Macrocosm or of the Seal of Solomon, the interlaced triangles, one white and th e other black Page 190 of 242"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" Above the transparency in the East are, in gilded l etters, the words Lux e Tenebris . In the West is suspended a transparency, displaying the sign of the Microcosm or the Pentagram, traced on white with lines of vermilion, and with a single point upward, thus: In the South is a painting of the Temple of Solomon . At the entrance to it, to which an ascent by seven steps is represented, is painted a man, holdi ng in his arms a white lamb, between the columns Jachin and Boaz. In each corner of the chamber is suspended, about s ix feet above the floor, an equilateral triangle; its three sides coloured respectively whi te, black, and red, and each side measuring about eighteen inches, thus: 'In the North is a transparency, on which the follo wing figure appears: Page 191 of 242"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" On the right of the presiding officer, in the East, on a gilt pedestal, is a caduceus, gilded; the upper part of it a cross, surmounted by a globe-two serpents twining around the caduceus, their heads rising above the cross.

The altar is square, with a gilded horn or flame at each corner. On it is a plate of white marble, upon which is inlaid in gold the pentagram. Upon th is lies the book of constitutions open, and near it a censer. OFFICERS- THEIR STATIONS, CLOTHING, ETC. The presiding officer is styled \"Father Adam.\" He s its in the East, clothed in a saffron-colored robe, and with head covered. In his right hand he h olds a sceptre, its handle gilded, and on the top a globe of gold. His jewel is a sun of gold, su spended by a chain of gold,. worn round the neck. The reverse side of the jewel is a hemisphere of gold, showing the northern half of the ecliptic and zodiac, with the signs from Taurus; to Libra inclusive. When the degree is conferred, no jewel or apron is worn. There is but one Warden. He sits in the West, and i s called \"Brother Truth.\" He wears a rose- coloured robe, and bears a white rod, at the end of which is an eye of gold. His jewel is like that of the Master. The order of the degree is also worn by each of the se officers. It is a broad, white, watered ribbon, worn as a collar. On the right side is an e ye of gold. The apron is of pure white lambskin, with no edging or ornament except the pentagram, which is traced on the middle of it with vermilion. There are seven other officers, who are styled, col lectively, \"The Seven Malakoth\", Kings, Envoys, Angels), and, separately, the first, second , third,\" etc, Malak, or, \"Brothers Gabriel, Uriel, Michael, Raphael, Zarakhiel, Hamaliel, and Tsaphiel .\" The first is called \"Malak Malakoth.\" These officers wear robes of a bright flame-color, with t he cordon of the degree, and for a jewel a seven- pointed star of gold. They wear also the apron. The jewel may be suspended from the collar.

PRAYER 0 uncreated reason, spirit of light and wisdom, who se breath gives and withdraws the form of everything! The universe is thy utterance and revel ation. Thou, before whom the life of beings is a shadow that changes, and a vapour that passes away! Thou breathest forth, and the endless spaces are peopled; thou drawest breath, and all th at went forth from thee return to thee again. Unending movement, in eternal permanence! we adore and worship thee with awe and Page 195 of 242"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"reverence. We praise and bless thee in the changing empire of created light, of shadows, of reflections, and of images; and we incessantly aspi re toward thy immovable and imperishable splendour. Let the ray of thy intelligence and the warmth of thy love reach unto us! Then what is movable will be fixed, the shadow become a body, th e dream a thought. Incline us, 0 Spirit of Spirits to obey thy will ! Help us, 0 Eternal Soul of Souls to perform our duties! 0 imperishable breath of life, 0 mouth that givest and takest away the existence of all beings, in the flow and reflow of thy eternal word, which is the divine oce an of movement and of truth; make our efforts to do good effectual, and let the light of thy divine truth shine in the souls of all mankind! Amen! RECEPTION But little of the immense amount of instruction con tained in the degree of Knight of the Sun can be given in a manual of the rite; the degree is vol uminous, and the monitorial parts are extensive, and it is deemed more appropriate that they should be laid before the student and neophyte directly from the ritual in the hands of the Comman der-in-chief of the Consistory. The following points are however inscribed. 1. Science is preserved by silence, and perpetuated by initiation. The law of silence is absolute and inviolable, only with respect to the initiated multitude. Science makes use of symbols; but for its transmission, language also is indispensable wh erefore the sages must sometimes speak. But when they speak, they do so, not to disclose or to explain, but to lead others to seek for and find the truths of Science and the meaning of the symbol s. 2. The Hermetic Masters said, \" Make gold potable, and you will have the universal medicine.\" By this they meant to say, appropriate truth to your u se, let it be the spring from which you shall drink all your days, and you will have in yourselves the immortality of the sages. We are the authors of our own destinies; and God does not save us without our co-operation. Death is not, for the sage. It is a phantom which the ignorance and weakness of the multitude make horrible Change is the evidence of movement, and movement reveals life alo ne. Even the body would not be decomposed if it were dead. All the atoms that comp ose it retain life, and move to free themselves. The spirit is not the first to be disen gaged that it may live no longer. Can thought and love die, when the basest matter does not? If chang e should be called death, we die and are born again every day; for every day our forms change. Le t us fear, then, to go out from and rend our garments, but let us not dread to lay them aside wh en the hour for rest comes! 3. The divine light, that outshining of the supreme reason or word of the Deity, \"which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,\" has not been altogether wanting to the devout of any creed. The permanent revelation, one and universal, is written in visible nature, is explained by reason, and completed by the wise analogies of fait h. Faith has in all ages been the lever whereby to move the world. 4. There is no invisible world. There are only diff erent degrees of perfection in the organs The body is the gross representation, and, as it we re, the temporary envelope of the soul. The soul can perceive, by itself, and without the i ntervention of the bodily organs, by means of its sensibility and lucidity, the things, whether spiri tual or corporeal, that exist in the universe. There is no void in nature; all is peopled. There is no real death in nature; all is living. Page 196 of 242"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"5. What we call death is change. The supreme reason , being unchangeable, is therefore imperishable. Thoughts, once uttered, are immortal. Is the source or spring from which they flow less immortal than they? How could the thoughts exi st, if the soul from which they emanated were to cease to be? Could the universe, the uttered tho ughts of God, continue still to exist if he no longer were? 6. Nature is the primary, consistent, and certain r evelation or unveiling of God. It is his utterance, word, and speech. Whether he speaks to us through a man, must depend, even at first, on human testimony, and afterward on hearsay or tradit ion. But in and by his work we know the Deity, even as we know the mind of another man, and his thoughts, by his acts and words. We can no more be face to face with the soul of anothe r man than we can with God. 7. Analogy is the last word of science, and the fir st of faith. Harmony is in equilibrium; and equilibrium subsists by the analogy of contraries. The absolute unity is the supreme and last reason of things. This reason can neither be one pe rson or three persons: it is one reason, and the reason, surpassing and transcendent. Religions seem to be written in heaven and in all nature. That ought to be so; for the work of God is the book of God, and in what lie writes we ought to see the expression of his thought, and con sequently of his being; since we conceive of him only as the supreme thought. In the West, over the Warden, you behold the holy a nd mysterious pentagram, the sign of the microcosm, or universe, called \"The blazing star,\" the sign of intellectual omnipotence and autocracy, which has been partially explained to yo u heretofore. It represents what is called in the Kabala microprosopos, being in some sort a human fi gure, with the four limbs, and a point representing the head. It is the universe contained within the Deity. It is a sign ancient as history and more than history; and the complete understandi ng of it is the key of the two worlds. It is the absolute philosophy and natural science. All the mysteries of Magism,.all the symbols of the gnosis, all the figures of the occult philosophy, all the kabalistic keys of prophecy, are summed lip in the sign of the pentagram, the greatest and most potent of all signs. The white dove and black raven in the West represen t the two principles of Zoroaster and Manes, good and evil, light and darkness; and the fourth a nd fifth sephiroth of the Kabala, the mercy or benignity, and the justice or severity of the Deity . The candidate in the ancient initiations surrendere d without reservation his life and liberty to the Masters of the Temples of Thebes or of Memphis; he advanced resolutely amid innumerable terrors,- that might well lead him to suppose that it was intended to take life. He passed through fire, swam torrents of dark and foaming water, was suspended by frail ropes over bottomless gulfs. Was this not blind obedience, in the fullest sense of the word ? To surrender one's liberty for the moment, in order to attain a glorious emanc ipation, is not this the most perfect exercise of liberty itself? This is what those have had to do, what those have always done, who have aspired to the Holy Empire of magical omnipotence. The disc iples of Pythagoras imposed on themselves a complete speechlessness for many years; and even the followers of Epicurus only learned the sovereignty of pleasure, by a self-imposed sobriety and calculated temperance. Life is a warfare, in which one must prove himself a man, to ascend in rank Force is not given: it must be seized. If the sacred Scriptures are inspired, God himself has told us that he makes good and creates evil. It is owing to human vanity that no man has e ver dared to reason with common sense on this subject Man pursues, tortures, and kills the most i nnocent animals, birds, and fishes, to gratify his appetite, or for mere pleasure. He crushes thousand s of insects without a thought of wrong; nay, he destroys, as does every other animal, myriads of animalalae and infusoria daily, unconsciously, and without being able to avoid it. Throughout the whole scale of animal creation, Page 197 of 242"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"one creature lives by devouring another, and every step taken, or movement made, or breath drawn by each, crushes out life. Pain and sickness, calamity and death, are the lot of all created beings. The world teems everywhere with life, and is people d with innumerable myriads of beings sensitive to pain. It was not created for man alone ; and it is not only precisely what the divine and perfect wisdom intended, but it is all that a mater ial world, peopled by beings with material bodies, could by possibility be. The millennium on this ear th is the real Utopia, fabulous and impossible, of visionary dreamers. Man is what the Deity meant he should be-imperfect, feeble, fallible, liable to err, and sensitive to pain, but capable of impro vement and progression, and of a heroism that can smile at agony, be content with destitution, pr eserve an equal mind under the lash of injustice, and without unmanly fear await the appro ach of death and count the pulses of his life. The man who can do this has attained the equilibriu m of faith and reason, and may claim to be called Magus, Prince, Adept, and Knight of the Sun.

I understand the sanctity of the knightly word, as you may see by the confidence I have place d in yours; and 1 have also heard from those who have been in your camps, as prisoners and otherwise, that there is among you a strange equality, so that a knight, though poor, ma y sit in the presence of a monarch. Tell me if that be so. G.: M.: It is. Thou hast not been misinformed. The name of Knight, and gentle blood, entitle the possessor to place himself in the same rank with so vereigns of the first degree, so far as regards Page 201 of 242"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"all but kingly authority and dominion. If the great est king were to wound the honour of the poorest knight, he could not, by the law of chivalry, refus e satisfaction by single combat.

The poorest knight is free, in all honourable service, to devote his hand and sword, t he fame of his exploits, and the deep devotion of his heart, to the fairest princess that ever wore a coronet. G.: M.: Thou must profess thy belief in the one tru e and everliving God; and ye Saracens worship not the true God. M.: of C.: Thou art mistaken, prince, for thou know est not our faith.

We believe in God, and that which hath been sent down to us, and that which hath been sent unto Abraham and Ishmael, and Isaac and Jacob, and the t ribes; and that which was delivered unto Moses and Jesus; and that which was delivered unto the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to God are we resigned. So speaketh the Koran everywhere. G.: M.: Princely Saladin, didst thou ever think of the Lord Jesus Christ, or does thy faith allow thee to believe in him?

Doth it not say,\" We formerly delivered the book of the law unto Moses, and caused apostles to succeed him, and gave evident miracles to Jesus, the Son of Mary, and strengthened him wit h the Holy Spirit? The angels said: O Mary, verily God hath chosen thee - verily God sendeth th ee the good tidings, that thou shalt bear the Word, proceeding from himself; his name shall be Ch rist Jesus; God shall teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the law and the gospel, and shall a ppoint him his apostle to the children of Israel. God took him up unto himself, and God is mi ghty and wise.

The Order of Knights Ecossais is a chivalric order, of great antiquity, and has numbered among its members many kings and princes; but its greatest boast is its in timate connection and alliance with an Order more ancient still.

Rise, good Knight and true Mason: be faithful, fear less, and merciful. LECTURE Masonry is the handmaid of religion. The Brahmin, t he Jew, the Mahometan, the Catholic, the Protestant - each professing his peculiar religion, sanctioned by the laws, by time, and by climate - may retain their faith, and yet may be Masons. Masonry teaches, and has preserved in their purity, the cardinal tenets of the old primitive faith, which underlie and are the foundation of all religi ons. Masonry is the universal morality which is suitable to the inhabitants of every clime - to the man of every creed. It has taught no doctrines except those truths that tend directly to the well- being of man; and those who have attempted to direct it toward useless vengeance, political ends, the Kabala, Hermeticism, Alchemy, Templarism, and Jesuitism, have merely perverted it to purposes foreign to its pure spirit and real nature. The best, and, indeed, the only good Mason, is he w ho, with the power of labour, does the work of life the upright mechanic, merchant, or farmer-t he man who exercises the power of thought, of justice, or of love - whose whole life is one great act of performance of Masonic duty. The natural work of Masonry is practical life: the use of all t he faculties in their proper spheres and for their natural functions. Love of truth, justice, and generosity, as attribut es of God, must appear in a life marked by these qualities. The natural form of Masonry - is goodnes s, morality, living a true, just, affectionate, sel f- faithful life, from the motive of a good man. It is loyal obedience to God's law. The good Mason does that which is good, which comes in his way, fr om a love of duty; and not merely because a law enacted by man or God commands his will to do i t. Not in, vain does the poor or oppressed look up to him. Page 203 of 242"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"You find such men in all Christian sects, Protestan t and Catholic; in all the great religious parties of the civilized world - among Buddhists, Mahometan s, and Jews. They are kind fathers, generous citizens, and unimpeachable in their busin ess: you see their Masonry in their works and in their play. The true Mason loves not only his ki ndred and his country, but all mankind; not only the good, but also the evil among his brethren. Tho ugh the ancient and the honourable of the earth bid him bow down to them, his stubborn knee b ends only at the bidding of his manly soul His Masonry is his freedom before God, not his bond age unto men. The old theologies, the philosophies of religion of ancient times, will not suffice us now; there are errors to be made way with, and their places suppli ed with new truths, radiant with the glories of heaven. There are great wrongs and evils in Church and State, in domestic, social, and public life, to be righted and outgrown. Masonry cannot in our age forsake the broad way of life; she must journey on in the open street, appear in the c rowded square, and teach men by her deeds - her life - more eloquent than any lips. This degree is much devoted to Toleration, and it i nculcates in the strongest manner that great leading idea of the Ancient Art - that a belief in the one true God, and a moral and virtuous life, constitute the only religious requisites needed to enable a man to be a Mason. It has ever the most vivid remembrance of the terri ble and artificial torments that were used to put down new forms of religion or extinguish the old. I t sees with the eye of memory the ruthless extermination of all the people, of all sexes and a ges - because it was their misfortune not to know the God of the Hebrews, or to worship him unde r the wrong name - by the savage troops of Moses and Joshua. It sees the thumbscrews and the r acks; the whip, the gallows, and the stake; the victims of Diocletian and Claverhouse; the mise rable covenanters; the non- conformists; Servetus bound, and the unoffending Quaker hung. It sees Cranmer hold his arm, now no longer erring, in the flame, until the hand drops off, in the consuming heat. It sees the persecutions of Peter and Paul, the martyrdom of Stephen, the trial s of Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin, and Irenaeus; and then, in turn, the sufferings of the wretched P agans under the Christian emperors, as of the Papists in Ireland, and under Elizabeth and the bes otted Henry; and all that in all ages have suffered by hunger and nakedness, peril and prison, the rack, the stake, and the sword - it sees them all, and shudders at the long roll of human at rocities. Man never had the right to usurp the unexercised pr erogative of God, and condemn and punish another for his belief. Born in a Protestant land, we are of that faith: if we had opened our eyes to the light under the shadows of St. Peter's at Rome, we should have been devout Romanists; born in the Jewish quarter of Aleppo, we should have con temned Christ as an impostor; in Constantinople, we should have cried, ' Allah il Al lah - God is great, and Mahomet is his Prophet.\" Birthplace and education give us our faith. Few believe in any religion because they have exami ned the evidences of its authenticity, and made up a formal judgment, upon weighing the testim ony. Not one in ten thousand knows anything about the proofs of his faith. We believe what we are taught; and those are most fanatical who know least of the evidences on which their creed is based. What is truth to me is not truth to another. The sa me arguments and evidences that convince one mind, make no impression on another: this differenc e is in men at their birth. No man is entitled positively to assert that he is right, where other men, equally intelligent and equally well-informed, hold directly the opposite opinion. Each thinks it impossible for the other to be sincere; and each, as to that, is equally in error. \"What is truth?\" w as a profound question - the most suggestive one ever put to man. Many beliefs of former and present times seem incomprehensible. They startle us with a new glimpse into the human soul - that my sterious thing, more mysterious the more we note its workings. Page 204 of 242"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Here is a man, superior to myself in intellect and learning, and yet he sincerely believes what seems to me too absurd to merit confutation; and I cannot conceive, and sincerely do not believe, that he is both sane and honest; and yet, he is bot h. His reason is as perfect as mine, and he, is as honest as I am. The fancies of a lunatic are realities to him. Our dreams are realities while they last; and in the past, no more unreal than what we have acted in our waking hours. No man can say that he hath as sure possession of a truth as of a chattel. When men entertain opinions diametrically opposed t o each other, and each is honest, who shall decide which hath the truth, and how can either say with certainty that he hath it? We know not what is the truth. That we ourselves believe and fe el absolutely certain that our own belief is true, is, in reality, not the slightest proof of the fact , seem it never so certain and incapable of doubt t o us. Therefore no man hath, or ever had, a right to pers ecute another for his belief; for there cannot be two antagonistic rights; and if one can persecute a nother because he himself is satisfied that the belief of that other is erroneous, the other has, f or the same reason, equally as certain a right to persecute him. The truth comes to us as the image of a rod comes t o us through the water, bent and distorted: an argument sinks into and convinces the mind of on e man, while from that of another it rebounds most quickly. It is no merit in a man to have a par ticular faith, excellent, and sound, and philosophic as it may be. It is no more a merit tha n his prejudices and his passions. The sincere Moslem has as much right to persecute u s, as we to persecute him ; and therefore Masonry wisely requires no more than a belief in on e great. all-powerful Deity, the Father and Preserver of the universe. Therefore she teaches he r votaries that toleration is one of the chief duties of every good Mason. The Masonic system rega rds all the human race as members of one great family - as having the same origin and the sa me destination; all distinctions of rank, lineage, or nativity, are alike unknown. The whole tenor of the life of the benevolent Founder of the Christian religion was unremitting benevolence; his kind offices were extended alike to Gentiles and Jews, to publicans and sinners, as well as to h is disciples. Yet Masonry is eternally vigilant that no atheist o r base libertine contaminates with his unhallowed tread the Sanctum sanctorum of our temple; such can never gain admission there, without the grossest violation of vows the most sacred and sole mn. It requires the acknowledgment of the existence of the Grand Master of the Universe, and to reverence his great and sacred name, irrespective of sectarian ideas; in a word, to prac tise every virtue which adorns and ennobles the human character, and fly every vice which sullies a nd degrades it. It inculcates a generous love for all mankind, it matters not of what religious c reed. No evil hath so afflicted the world as intolerance of religious opinion; the human beings it has slain in various ways, if once and together brought to life, would make a nation of people, which, left to live and increase, would have doubled the p opulation of the civilized portion of the world; among which civilized portion it chiefly is that re ligious wars are waged. No man truly obeys the Masonic law who merely toler ates those whose religious opinions are opposed to his own. Every man's opinions are his ow n private property, and the rights of all men to maintain each his own are perfectly equal. Merel y to tolerate, to bear with an opposing opinion, is to assume it to be heretical, and assert the rig ht to persecute, if we would, and claim our toleration as a merit. Page 205 of 242"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Mason's creed goes further than that; no man, i t holds, has any right, in any way, to interfere with the religious belief of another. It holds that each man is absolutely sovereign as to his own belief, and that belief is a matter absolutely fore ign to all who do not entertain the same belief; and that if there were any right of persecution at all, it would in all cases be it mutual right, because one party has the same right as the other t o sit as judge in his own case - and God is the only magistrate that can rightfully decide betw een them. To that Great Judge Masonry refers the matter; and, opening wide its portals, it invites to enter there, and live in peace and harmony, the Protestan t, the Catholic, the Jew, the Moslem - every one who will lead a truly virtuous and moral life, love his brethren, minister to the sick and distressed, and believe in the One, All-Powerful, A ll-Wise, Everywhere- Present God-Architect, Creator, and Preserver of all things-by whose unive rsal law of Harmony ever rolls on this universe: the great, vast, infinite circle of succe ssive death and life; to whose ineffable name let all true Masons pay profoundest homage! For whose t housand blessings poured upon us let us feel the sincerest gratitude, now, henceforth, and forever. Amen. Knight Kadosh The Thirtieth Grade of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and the First Degree of the Chivalric Series PREFATORY The three chivalric degrees of Knight Kadosh, Inqui sitor Commander, and Prince of the Royal Secret are intimately connected, and form the Templ ar degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. The labours of Masonry are well-nigh ended, so far as instruction is concerned,-the virtues of the Order are rehearsed, and the reward for a due rever ence of the obligations and a retention and observance of the vows and tenets of the Institutio n is accorded.

The four words of the Magi are, To Know, to Dare, t o Will, to be Silent, and are written in the four symbolic forms of the Sphynx. The accomplishment of these degrees brings us to th e completion of the third Temple; and the Royal Secret is solved, as to whether we have made this world a Temple fit for the abiding-place of the Grand Architect of the universe. If it be asked, for what good are the Superior degr ees cultivated? We might answer, that as to personal benefits, the opportunity to do good and c ommunicate; to practise all the Masonic virtues, as well as enjoy all the pleasures of fell owship and sociality-so far as these are considered within the sphere of the Masonic acquire ments of any brother-the original working degree of Ancient Craft Masonry will for him suffic e. Only to one who wishes to attain a more extensive knowledge of, and become fully accomplish ed in, the religious, philosophic, and chivalric departments of our Order, as they were cu ltivated in the dillerent ages of the world gone by, as well as at the present day, would we recomme nd initiation into the high degrees. He only will be competent to appreciate the honours and pri vileges attached to them, who possesses the disposition and ability to study the deeper and hig her mysteries of our Kabala, and will not rest satisfied until he has discovered a satisfactory so lution to every Masonic problem, and can, in every case, explain \"de que fabulum narratur;\" who can thoroughly understand the moral mysteries, as well as those of art and science, whi ch our legends unfold, and who has a laudable ambition to participate in the most exalted sphere, with congenial associates, in that subtle communion and fraternization which genuine 'Sublime Freemasonry' is peculiarly calculated to afford. ARGUMENT A Knight and Soldier of the Cross called Knight Kad osh proves himself practically a true defender of the Temple of the Most High God; and while armed with steel outwardly, he is inwardly armed with Faith and Love - Faith to God and Love to his fellow-man. It is his duty to defend the Order, to protect and assist all worthy pilgrims, the weak and the injured, the needy and the oppressed, with becoming humility and meekness, and yet with f idelity and prudence, as vowed on the Mystic Ladder. This practical trial degree of the Knight Templar i s replete with effective incident, and stands prominently forward as an interesting and exciting drama.

In the inferior bodies, instead of a collar, a Gran d Inspector Inquisitor Commander may wear around his neck a golden chain, from which hangs th e cross of the Order; the links of the chain are formed of the interlaced attributes of the eigh t fundamental degrees of Masonry-viz., 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and.30th The jewel is a silver Teutonic cross. The hat, same as Kadosh. When a Grand Inspector Inquisitor Commander, wearin g the proper insignia, viisits a Lodge of an inferior degree, he announces himself as a Grand In spector Inquisitor Commander. He is proved in the ordinary manner, and the report is made in t he ear of the Master, who causes all the members to be placed around the altar; he then send s the two Wardens to receive him, by whom he is conducted to the altar. The Master then leave s his seat, and placing the three gavels upon the altar, he presents them to the visiting brother , who accepts, and returns them to the Master, and to each of the Wardens, after which he is condu cted by the Master to the seat of honour. RECEPTION PRAYER Hear us with indulgence, O infinite Deity, whose at tributes are infinite, and yet infinitely harmonious. Thou, of whose essence all justice, equ ity, and mercy, intermingled into one infinite excellence. Thou, to whom all thoughts and all acti ons of men are known and visible, as thine own; to whom the infinite past and the infinite fut ure are one now; and the infinitudes of space in all directions are here. Give us the wisdom and the will to judge justly, accurately, and mercifully; and when we come to be finally judged by thee, do n ot thou judge us as, in our feebleness and passion, we may have judged others; but forgive us and take us home to thee. Amen! If the Knight Kadosh, when performing his pilgrimag e, proves himself recreant of any obligation, he should here be accused of the same. If deemed an unworthy Knight by the Judges on any a ccusation, he should be returned to the outer world for a probationary period; if not, the Most Perfect President proceeds, first taking a vote of the Judges.

All hu man judgment is, at best, uncertain; serious in its consequences, it must often, when time develops its errors, produce regret, and sometimes remorse. It is not wise to seek to judge our fellow -man; it is a stern duty, and an unwelcome task to be performed, and not a privilege to be coveted; and woe unto that man who assumes the prerogative of judgment, and, to some extent, usurp s the functions of God, not being himself just, upright, impartial. Subsequent to the dismissal of the Inquisition, and preparatory to the lessons and warnings being given, the music will be played. I was the just King Alfred of Saxon England; I fram ed wise laws, made upright judges, independent of my will and that of the people, and caused just and speedy judgment to be given. In all my realm, justice and right were sold to non e; denied to none; delayed to none. I slept little, I wrote much; I studied more. I reigned only to bless those over whom I had dominion. I have vanished into the thin past, and many ages have mar ched in solemn procession by my grave, yet I still live in the memory of men. They call me gre at king, wise law giver, just judge; follow, then, my example, or shudder to sit in judgment on thy fe llows. I was Socrates, the Athenian; I knew the holy myste ries, and reverenced God in nature. In the sacred groves of Athens, I taught to young and old that God was one, and the soul of man immortal. I taught obedience to the laws and decree s of the people of Athens, and the council of five hundred. When I sat in the court of the Areopa gus, I swore by the paternal Apollo, by Ceres, and by Jupiter the King, that I would sentence upri ghtly and according to law - or, when the law was silent, to the best of my judgment; and that I would not receive gifts, nor should any other for me; nor recieve bribes from any passion, prejudice, or affection; nor allow any other person to do the like by any means, whether direct or indirect, to prevent justice in the court. And when, by an unjust judgment, the same court condemned me to dea th, I refused to flee and escape, lest I should bring the laws into disrepute; holding the g ood citizen bound to submit to even the unjust judgment of the State. If thou wouldst fain become a judge of others, first prepare thyself by learning to obey the laws. I was Confucius, who read and interpreted to the pe ople of ancient China the great laws engraved by the finger of God, in everlasting lette rs, upon the pages of the many-leaved book of nature. I said to them, desire not for your country any other benefit than justice; the great law of duty is to be looked for in humanity. \"Justice is E quity,\" to render to every man that to which he is entitled. He who would stand above the ordinary lev el of man must be exempt from prejudices and self-conceit and obstinacy, and be governed by the mandates of justice alone. Hear much, reflect much, and say nothing superfluous. Let doub t of guilt be acquitted; and presumption of innocence be solid proof. \" That is the noblest rec ompense of human virtue!\" Do thou strive so to live and act, to obey and govern, and thou, too, ma yest live in the good opinion of men, after thou art dead, and thine influences may make thee, too, a king over the minds of men. I was Minos, the lawgiver of Crete. I taught the Cr etans that the laws which I enacted were dictated by Zeus, the Father; for all true and righ teous laws, and all human justice, are but developments of that eternal and infinite justice, that is of the essence of the Deity . He who assumes to judge his brethren clothes himself with the prerogative of God. \" Woe unto thee,\" if, being thyself vicious or criminal, thou dost assume to judge others; and still more, if thou givest corrupt judgment; for then will thy memory be execr ated, and in all time it shall be the bitterest reproach to an unjust judge to call him by thy name . I was Zoroaster, whose words became law to the Pers ians. I said he is the best servant of God, whose heart is upright, who is liberal, with due re gard to what is just to all men; who turns not his eyes toward riches, and whose heart wishes well to everything that lives. He alone is just who is charitable, and merciful in his judgments; and he a lone is wise who thinks well, and not evil, of Page 221 of 242"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"other men. Satisfy thine own conscience, and fear n either the outrages of fortune nor the injuries of enemies. Crime is not to be measured by the issu e of events, but by the bad intentions of the doer. Study, therefore, the dominion of thyself, an d quiet thine own commotions, and hold it the noblest ovation to triumph over thy passions. I was Moses, the leader and lawgiver of the Israeli tes. I was initiated into the mysteries and wisdom of Ancient Egypt; and that wisdom dictated t he statutes by which Israel was governed. Thou shalt take no gift; for the gift blindeth the wise and perverteth the words of the righteous. Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty. Ye shall hear the small as well as the great. Ye shall not fear the face of man; for judgment is of God. Sen.: Couns.: Thou hast heard the words of the grea t sages, lawgivers, and philosophers of antiquity. Behold! the monogram of the greatest law giver that has ever come among men, and listen reverentially to his teachings. If ye forgiv e not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your trespasses. But if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged. And with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. If thy brother trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. If h e shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. Judge not according to the appearance, but judge ri ghteous judgment. If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him; and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent,\" thou shalt forgive him. Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtai n mercy. You have heard the lessons of immortal wisdom, once uttered by mortal lips that have long since mouldered into dust.

The degree was originally a Christian degree of kni ghthood; its object was, for a long time, to reconquer the Holy Land and plant the Banner of the Cross once more on the ruined walls of Jerusalem. Many of the Knights of the Crusades were Masons, and thus became acquainted with the legend which Masonry had preserved. The Knights Kadosh are the legitimate successors of the Templars. None but earnest and sincere men, unselfish, and wh ose philanthropy is not a mere name, but a practical reality, should enter here - such as will do Masonry good service in the war which she is waging against the ancient enemies of the human rac e - a lover of wisdom and an apostle of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.

As you pass around and through this camp, we will give you the necessary explanation as to its extern al features, and recall briefly to your mind the characteristics of the several degrees whose standa rds float over the camp, to aid you in hereafter understanding the esoteric meaning of the whole. The external lines of the camp form a nonagon, or a figure of geometry with nine equal si des. You perceive that on each side of the nonagon is a tent with a flag and pennon; that each flag and its pennon are of a different color from the others, and that each tent is designated b y a letter. Each represents a camp, and the several sides of the nonagon are assigned by our ri tuals to the Masons of the different degrees from the 1st to the 18th. At the 9th tent were encamped the Apprentices, Fell ow-Crafts and Masters of the Blue or Symbolic Degrees, and the volunteers. The commandin g officer represents Ezra. The 1st degree shows you man, such as nature has ma de him, with no other resources than his physical strength. The 2d degree teaches the necessity and holiness of labour, and consequently of knowledge. The 3d degree teaches us that our unavoidable desti ny is death; but at the same time, in the ceremony and in the very name of Hiram, it shadows forth the great doctrine of another life, and the immortality of the soul.
