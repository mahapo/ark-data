The light that Shines in our Council, is composed of a glass globe filled with water, and the light is placed behind it, therefore renders the light more clear through the glass of reflection – this globe when lighted is placed in the South. The Grand Master or Thrice Puissant is named Father Adam, is placed in the East, vested in a Robe of pale yellow, like the morning, his hat on – holding in his hand a Scepter on the top of which is a globe of gold, and the handle or Extremity of the Scepter, also gilded. The reason that Adam Carries the globe above the Scepter in this council is, because he was constituted sovereign master of the world, and created Sovereign father of all men.

He sits in the west opposite Father Adam, and is decorated with the Same Jewel and order as the Thrice Puissant Father Adam. He wears besides a large white watered ribbon, as a collar, with an Eye of gold embroidered or painted thereon above the gold chain and Sun. The Number of the other officers are 7, and are Called by the names of the Cherubim, (viz.): Zaphxiel, Zabriel, Camael, Uriel, Michael, Zaphael & Gabriel. These ought to be decorated in the Same manner as the Thrice Puissant Father Adam. If there are more than that number of Knights of the Sun, they go by the names of Sylphs, and are the preparers of the Council and assistants in all the ceremonies, or operations of the Grand Council. These wear the same jewel, to a ribbon of a fiery color to the 3 rd buttonhole of their coats. TO OPEN THE GRAND COUNCIL, THE MIGHTY FATHER ADAM SAYS: Q: Brother Truth, what time is it on the Earth? A: Mighty Father, it is midnight among the Cowans or Profane, but the Sun shines in its Meridian in this Lodge. Then Father Adam proceeds and says: “My dear children, profit of the favor of this austere Luminary, showing its light to us which will conduct us in the path of virtue, and to follow that Law, which ought Eternally to be engraved on our hearts, and which Law is the only that can conduct us, and by which we cannot fail to come to the knowledge of pure Truth.”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Then Father Adam makes the Sign, and puts his right hand on his left breast, on which all the brethren put up the first finger of their right hands above the height of their heads, the other fingers clenched, showing thereby, that there is but one God, who is the beginning of all Truth.

THE FORM OF A RECEPTION. After the Lodge, or Council, is opened, the Candidate is introduced in an ante-chamber, where there are a number of Sylphs, each with a pair of Bellows, blowing a large pot with fire, which the Candidate sees, but they take no notice of him. After 2-3 minutes the Most Antient of the Sylphs goes to the Candidate and covers his face with a black crepe or veil (he must be without hat or sword). The Antient Sylph tells him that he must find the door of the Holy Sanctuary, which, when he has found it, he must knock six times on it with an open hand. After he has knocked, Brother Truth goes, and opens the door a little, and asks the Candidate the following questions, which he answers by the help of the Antient Sylph: Q: What do you desire? A: I desire to go out of darkness; to see the true light; and to know the Holy Truth in all its purity. Q: What do you desire more? A: To divest myself of Original Sin, and destroy the juvenile"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"prejudices of Error, to which all men are liable: namely, the desires of all worldly attachment and pride. On which, Brother Truth goes to Father Adam and relates what the Candidate has told him, who then gives him orders to introduce him to true happiness. Brother Truth then opens the door, takes the Candidate by the hand, and conducts him to the middle of the Lodge or Sanctuary, which is also covered with Black Cloth, when Father Adam addresses him: “My son, seeing that by your labor in the Royal Art, you are now come to the desire of knowing the pure and holy truth, we shall lay it open to you, without any disguise or covering. But before we do this, consult your heart, and see in this moment, if you feel yourself disposed to obey Her (namely Truth) in all things that She commands? If you are at present disposed as I have desired, I am sure, She is ready in your heart, and you now must feel an Emotion that was unknown to you before?

Then Brother Truth proceeds: “My dear Brother, by my mouth Holy Truth speaks to you – but before She manifests Herself to you, She requires from you Proofs by which She is to be Satisfied. In your Entrance into the Masonic Order She has appeared to you in many things, which you could not have comprehended without Her assistance!

To know the price and value of the action, and that God with whom everything is possible, communicates nothing of his will, but such as his great goodness pleases, and everything in the universe is governed, as he has decreed it, with just being able to compare it to the attributes of the Divinity. I equally say that in himself there is no Evil, because he has made everything with exactness, and that everything exists according to his will, consequently, as it ought to be. The distance of good and evil with the Divinity, cannot be more justly and clearly compared, than that which a Circle formed with a compass, from the points reunited form an entire Circumference, and represents the Immensity of God who is the beginning of all things. For as the points form a Circumference by its reunion, which points when separated, is the beginning of all solids existing or possible; and when any point in particular equally approaches or equally separates from its point is only a faint resemblance of the distance between good and evil, which we compare by the points of a compass forming a circle, which Circle, when completed, is GOD. Square. By the Square, we discover, that GOD has made everything equal. In the same manner, as you are not able to dig a body in a quarry complete or perfect.
