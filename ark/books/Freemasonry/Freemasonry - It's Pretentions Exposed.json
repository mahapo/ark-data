THE first Free Mason Lodge in North America was es- tablished in New-Jersey, A. D. 1730, by warrant from the mother of lodges, the Grand Lodge of England, under the hand of the Duke of Norfolk, Grand Master. (Preston.) The revolutionary struggle caused Free Masonry, for a season, to flourish; then it languished; and it was almost breathless at the time the first grand chapter was formed; and the first edition of Webb's Free Mason's Monitor was published, A. D. 1797. Then it revived, and though checked by the works of theAbbe Barruel, and Professor Robison, it bore them down at length with the multiplicity of its as- sertions, and went on increasing until A.

The opinions of the writer cannot be mistaken; but they have no value that you do not give them; and if they are not justified by a perusal of the copious authorities within the two covers of this book, neither his nor any other name will justify them. He asks no credit for facts, or for asser- tions: these are made and furnished by Webb, Town, Cross, Preston, Hutchinson, Cole, Lawrie, Dermott, Smith, Greenleaf, Dalcho, Tannehill, Hardie, and the various grand officers and grand lodges, who have sanctioned their labours. The writer is a compiler from their pages, with only the remarks suitable for refreshment; and, if Free Masonry is condemned, it must be from just quotations of her own commentators, the title and page in every instance accompanying the quotation. The whole merit of the question lies between faithful extracts of masonic authors here given, and the truth. The attorney collects, arranges, and illustrates facts; the reader is to decide the case; the reader is the judge; and if your attorney appear before you in a respectful manner, address you in plain English, and argue his case diligently, not tra- velling out of the record, I trust you will give him a patient hearing; and, believe, if his name could be valuable to you, it should be forthcoming with the promptness of truth, and without fear of the mystery whose doctrine is VENGEANCE, and whose daring defies both the laws of God and of man. \" Yet all are not satisfied.\" All cannot be satisfied.

But she may run against \" Free Masonry\" until out of wind, and it will hold way with her. She will escape from it, when the horse escapes from his shadow. Every assault upon \" Free Masonry\" will surely be well directed; she has liber- ty ; let no name parry her blows. Again, what can any name add to the author's view of this subject ? Suppose the name were Jefferson ; she would array against it, in a single paragraph, Washington, Frank- lin, Warren, La Fayette, George the King, the Dukes of York, and of Sussex, &c. and what could he do ? With one flourish of her magical wand, she would marshal against it the Patriarchs, the Kings of Israel, and the Prophets; with another, all the heathen philosophers of Greece and of Rome; what could the supposed Jefferson say? Only that truth will stand in its own name against the assembled universe.

He received the secret of the lodges in due form, under able masters; laboured at the lectures with the resolution of a hale man taking patent medicines; others found them so beneficial, he would not fail of their benefit for the want of a fair trial, All the language of the lodges, and the te- dious details of the lectures, he learned by dint of perseve- rance, and could once rehearse equal to his satisfaction: still the charm refused to operate, the talisrnanic influence failed to exert itself; and, like one fairly innoculated with genuine matter, he, to the disappointment of the doctor, .yet took the disease the natural way. With great simplicity he sought the meaning of this, mo- destly inquiring of the Royal Arch and great Masons; but a sure hint at the master's entire ignorance of the subject, was always sufficient, when coming from men four, seven, and ten degrees above him, completely to shut his mouth. He could not presume to doubt what they, from their ele- vation, saw clearly; and having no disposition further to climb the eminence, nor relish for the twilight of the lodges, he withdrew from the connexion; travelling, but neither giving nor receiving lion's patvs, due guards, or grips ; nei- ther knowing a man, nor being known, as a Free Mason. From this state of tranquillity he was disturbed by an event, which, unworthy as it might seem to its agents, dis- turbed every Mason, and shook every lodge, in the Union; agitated, and does yet greatly agitate, the public mind; sever-. ing friendships, dividing families, rending churches.

Here the veil drops; the victim can be traced no further, except in the reports of his merciless death, which are not a little strengthened by the flight, and continued absence in foreign parts, or in distant terri- tories, of three active masonic conspirators.

In strict accord with this view, the poet sings in lines ap- proved by the constituted authorities of Free Masonry; \" When earth's foundation first was laid By the Almighty Artist's hand, 'Twas then our perfect laws were made, Established by his strict command.\" It ifr plainly, then, one of the pretensions of Free Ma- sonry, that the order of Masonry was established at the pe- riod of creation.

It is very evident, then, that Free Masonry lies under a flat contradiction on the first pretension. The principle of liberty is as old as the creation, or as any of the principles of masonry. But how absurd it would be to date the independence of these United States from the beginning of time! And hot less absurd is it, to date ma- sonry from that early period, because some of the principles it has chosen to adopt are, indeed, much older. So con- clusive is this argument to my mind, that I take my leave of the first pretension with a strong hope, that an effort will be speedily made to rectify the 6ra of Free Masonry to some possible date; and, as one of the brethren, I cheerfully offer my services to aid in the work. A lame attempt is made to rest the second pretension on the authority of Josephus; but as the relation of that author differs essentially from the masonic tradition, if it proves any thing in the premises, it is unfavourable to the pretensions of Free Masonry. 1 I will set the pretension from the Monitor by the side of Josephus 9 relation, that the reader may compare for him- self. .

Josephus supposes the stone pillar to remain in the land of Siriad to his day; but masonic tradition says, \" the marble pillar fell in the general destruction of the deluge. 11 Not to waste time on these matters, I have three princi- pal objections to allege against the reasonableness of this second pretension. Sec. 1.

Had the erection of the pillars been the work of the last years of his life, they must have been 569 years old at the deluge; and, if there were not some Old Mortality of the antediluvian world, to clink his hammer and chisel over the hieroglyphics anew, from century to century, the builder of the monuments might reasonably fear that the corroding hand of time would utterly destroy the inscriptions before they could be read \" by the posterity of those whom God should be pleased to spare\" Sec 3.

If the lodges are a little vexed, it is not so with the social circles; and, as a lover of all that is Ioyely, I freely confess, that the interest of the ladies is worth incompara- bly more to my single self, than the interest of Free Mason- ry; that one glance of encouragement from their eyes, whom it is man's high privilege to love, to cherish, and to admire, would enable the humble writer to withstand the frowns of the lodges through time. I desire to say this with some spirit, my reader, knowing as I do that there are those who knit their brows, and make use of swelling words against an honest attempt to investi- gate an ancient institution, and who regard, as nearly allied to sacrilege, any attempt to remove the rubbuh of the dark ages from the inside, and to put the true colour upon the out- side of the fabric of Free Masonry.

Any disposition, therefore, to check inquiry upon this sub- ject, will not be well received by an intelligent community; and any attempt to put down the investigation, except by meeting it fairly, will necessarily recoil upon the heads of the adventurers. After this refreshing excursion; I return to the Free Ma- son's Monitor, New-York edition, 1802, and find among the more important, obnoxious, and fully detailed pretensions of the institution, the following, respecting the miraculous commitment, from time to time, of the true name of the Deity, to the keeping of the fraternity! Fifteen pages of that edition of the Monitor, from the 245th to the 260th, are principally devoted to the detail^ of this wonderful trust; faithful extracts of these details I will now lay before the reader. Part 2. Chap. 1.—\" Enoch, the son of Jared, was the sixth son in descent from Adam, and lived in the fear and love of God his father. God appeared to him in a vision, and thus deigned to speak to him. As thou art desirous to know my name, attend, and it shall be revealed nto thee. Upon this a mountain seemed to rise to the heavens, and Enoch was transferred to the top thereof, where he beheld a triangular plate of. gold most brilliantly enlightened, and upon which were some characters, which he received a strict injunction never to pronounce. Presently he seemed to be lowered perpendicularly into the bowels of the earth, through nine arches; in the ninth or deepest of which, he saw the same brilliant plate which was shown to him in the mountain.\" \" Enoch being inspired by the Most High, and in com*"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"14 PRETENSIONS OF FREE MASONRY. memoration of this wonderful vision, built a temple under ground, in the same spot where it was shown to him— which, like that, consisted of nine arches, one above ano- ther, and dedicated the same to God. This happened in that part of the world which was afterwards called the land of Canaan, since known by the name of the Holy Land. \" Enoch, in imitation of what he had seen, caused a tri- angular plate of gold to be made, each side of which was a cubit long; he enriched it with the most precious stones, and incni8ted the plate upon a stone of agate of the same form. He then engraved upon it the same ineffable cha- racters which God had shown to him, and placed it on a triangular pedestal of white marble, which he deposited in the ninth or deepest arch. \" When Enoch's temple was completed, he received the following command, viz. ' Make a door of stone, and let there be a ring of iron therein, by which it may be occa- sionally raised, and let it be placed over the opening of the first arch, that the sacred matters enclosed therein may be preserved from the universal destruction now impending/ And he did so; and none but Enoch knew of the precious treasure which the arches contained, nor knew the right pronunciation of the great and sacred name. 1 ' The Monitor next gives an account of Enoch's two pil- lars, and the wonderful preservation of the knowledge of the liberal arts, \" particularly of Masonry/ 9 during the univer- sal deluge; which topic has been already noticed. I take up the account of the Monitor relating to this ineffable name after the deluge, in the following words: \" We learn from Holy Writ, the history of succeeding times, till the Israelites became slaves to the Egyptians; from which bondage they were freed under the conduct of Moses. The same sacred book informs us that Moses was beloved of God, and that the Most High spoke to him on Mount Sinai. To Moses God communicated his divine law writ- ten on tables of stone, with many promises of a renewed alliance. He also gave him the true pronunciation of his"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"rKETENSIONS OP FREE MASONRY. 15 sacred name, which he told him should be found by some of his descendants, engraved upon a plate of gold; and God gave a strict command unto Moses that no one should pro- nounce his sacred name; so that, in process of time, the true pronunciation was lost.\" Thus the true word was lost, Free Masons having only the promise of God left, that it should be found \" engraved upon a plate of gold.\" The particulars of the wonderful discovery of Enoch's triangular plate of gold, will be food for admiration. CHAPTER IV. Containing an account of wonderful adventures, to which the poet pro- bably alluded when he sung: \" Unite, unite, your voices raise, \" Loud, loudly sing Free Mason's praise; \" Spread far and wide their spotless fame, \" And glory in the sacred name: \" How just, how just are all their ways, \" Superior far to mortal praise! \" Their worth, description far exceeds, \" For matchless are Free Masons' deeds.\" Preston. London edition. A. D. 1792, p. 379. THE preceding chapter gives ample details from the Free Mason's Monitor, of the pretended revelation of the true name of the Most High to Enoch and Moses, for the be- nefit of the masonic fraternity I With the reader's patience, I shall continue that subject; but observe that I extract from the New-York edition, 1802, as some later editions of the Monitor fail of giving all the particulars here quoted,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"16 PRETENSIONS OF TREE MAbUNRY. « though the principal facts are alluded to with undoubting confidence; for convenience I number the sections ex- tracted. 1. \"Solomon, being the wisest of princes, had folly in remembrance the promise of God to Moses, that some of his descendants, in fulness of time, should discover his holy name ;* and his wisdom inspired him to believe, that this could not be accomplished until he had erected and con* secrated a temple to the living God, in which he might deposit the precious treasure,\" 2. u Accordingly, Solomon began to build, in the fourth year of his reign, agreeably to a plan given him by his fa- ther David, upon the ark of the alliance.\" By a careful reading of sections 1 and 2, it appears, that King Solomon, under the impression that the holy name of the Deity could not be discovered until he had erected and consecrated a temple to the living God, \" accordingly began to build ;\" that is, Solomon built the temple chiefly to recover the lost word, the ineffable word, the shibboleth of Free Masonry! And, reader, do you not believe it ? The important fact perfectly accounts for the craft's having ever since so much to do with that holy edifice; and the next edition of the Bible ought to be corrected; 1 Kings, v. 5, where Solomon says, \" And, behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God;\" that it may read, I purpose to build a house to discover the lost name, &c. 3. u He chose a spot for this purpose, the most beautiful and healthy in all Jerusalem.

What were the materials of the tapestry which lay bu. ried in ruins from the time of the deluge, and was tapestry yet after a lapse of 1400 years ? 4. \" All the treasures\"—but I must abridge; the rela- tion is long, and so particular as to be wholly incredible. Solomon, the king, supposing something idolatrous in these ruins, \" declined building in that spot, lest the worship of the Deity should be profaned by the place.\" Under the temple (which was erected in another place) he built a vault, having a long narrow descent through nine arches, where he used to retire in company with Hiram of Tyre and Hiram of Abiff, when they had occasion to enter upon things of a secret and important nature. 5. \" There were then none else living qualified to enter the sacred vault. One of their number being removed from them, disordered their system for a time; and, as they were consulting in what manner to supply his absence, - application was made to them by some intendants of the building, illustrious knights, and grand master architects, who well knew there was a secret place under the temple, in which the king, &c. used to meet, soliciting the honour of being admitted there; to whom Solomon replied with an open air, my brethren, it cannot now be granted.\" How wonderfully exact is Masonic tradition! even the \"open air\" with which the king put off his inquisitive princes is not forgotten. 6. \" Some days after this circumstance, Solomon sent for the three grand master architects, Joabert, Stockin,and G., and directed them to go and search once more amongst the ancient ruins, where so much treasure had been already found, in hopes of finding more. They accordingly de- parted, and one of them, viz. O., in working with the pick- axe amongst the rubbish, came to the large iron ring;—they found it fixed in a large stone perfectly square. With much difficulty they raised it, when the mouth of a deep and dis- mal cavern appeared.\" This is the identical iron ring which Enoch placed there 3"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"18 PRETENSIONS OF FREE MASONRY, 3000 years before!

But this was dry as a garret quite to the bottom of the ninth arch, where G. arrived much fatigued; having been twice discouraged in his descent, and compelled to return; giving a signal to his companions to draw him up. 7. \" When (on the third trial) he had descended into the ninth arch, a parcel of stone and mortar suddenly fell in and extinguished his light; and he was immediately struck with the sight of a triangular plate of gold, richly adorned with precious stones; the brilliancy of which struck him with astonishment. Again he gave the signal, and was as- sisted in reascending.\" [Observe; he saw not the triangle until his extinguished light left him in total darkneps. O, Free Masonry, what a wonder!] 8. G., who it appears is no other than the promised de- scendant of Moses, who was in due time to find the sacred name, \" engraved on a plate of gold,\" told his companions, Joabert and Stockin, the wonders he had seen; and, by means of a rope ladder, they all descended to the bottom together. They examined the gold plate, and observed cer- tain characters engraved thereon, of the meaning of which they were then ignorant; they therefore determined to car- ry the treasure to Solomon, and solicit the honour of being admitted to the knowledge of this sublime mystery.\" 9.

In consideration of this, Solomon conferred upon them u the most sublime and mysterious degree of rqyal arch Masonry,* and explained to them, how the promise of God, made to Noah, Moses, and his father David, was now accomplished. That promise which assured them that in fulness of time his name should be discovered, engraved upon a plate of gold; that they were, bound to defend the sacred characters, and that they were not at liberty to pro- nounce the sacred name/ 1 11. \"The king* informed the three knights, that until that time, they knew nothing of that word but by tradition ; and that in the course of its being handed down through a succession of ages, it had been much corrupted.

It seems impossible that a sober man can persuade himself of a fact so absurd and extravagant, as that Masonry, through Enoch and Moses, is by the divine favour alone made acquainted with the true name of the Deity; yet foolish Masons, pillars of the lodges, have challenged professing Christians to give the true name of God, and on failure to give the Shibboleth of Masonry, have replied with evident self-complaisance— \" you do not know the true name of God:\" the God of the holy scriptures! Masons, seeing this pretension set out by itself, will, I hope, be universally shocked at it; but the admirers of the institution, reading it as it is set forth in the Monitor, do naturally pass it without consideration; and flatter them- selves that such particular tokens of divine favour are sure proof of the antiquity, grandeur, and divinity of this self- privileged system.

If this pretension mean any thing, it is no less than impious; but as in the hearts of intelligent Masons, it means nothing, let us away with it; let it be blotted out of the books for ever, that it no longer prove a snare to the un- wary. One notable circumstance (sec. 11.) is: u The true name is said to have been visible in the temple at the time St Je- rome flourished, written in the ancient Samaritan charac- ters.\" This is the way with masonic tradition, so exact, as even to remember the Samaritan characters! but what temple was that? Enoch's subterraneous temple fell in, after the erection of Solomon's; Solomon's was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar; and the foundations of the second temple were ploughed up by Titus, A. D. 70. Free Masonry pretends, that the true and ineffable name was deposited in each of these three temples; but what ma- sonic temple was there in the time of St. Jerome ? St. Je- rome is well known to have been among the most learned of the ancient fathers, the mortal enemy of the Origenists, the cotemporary of Theodosius the Great, and of Alaric, king of the Goths; and to have died A. D. 420, 350 years after the total subversion of the last temple by Titus. Yet in St. Jerome's time, if we can believe masonic tradition, the true name was visible in the temple, written in the an- cient Samaritan characters! v This is the same witness who testifies that king Solomon built the temple, not unto the name of the Most High; and that the wisest man (0,Free Masonry, how much your debtor for this information,) did not know the true pronunciation of the name which his father David had sweetly sung: \" Bless the Lord, O my soul; all that is within me bless his holy name:\" \" O, give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name ; sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works; glory ye in his holy name :\" but he learned it from the golden triangle, which no sooner than his light expired, the man saw!"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"22 PRETENSIONS OF FREE MASONRF.

These began to be extremely jealous of the pre-eminence shown to ths twenty-five brethren. They deputed, therefore, a cer- tain number * to wait on King Solomon, with their compli- ments? to request that similar honours might be conferred on them. The king heard them with the most benign air imaginable, gave them for answer, that the twenty-Jive masters were justly entitled, 11 &c.; and bade them \" Go in peace.

They accordingly departed at break of day, and upon their arrival were perfectly astonished at the sirange appearance of the place. There were no re- mains of the arches to be seen, nor could they learn that one single person, of all those who had descended, escaped the destruction.\" Three things, among others, are particularly noticeable in this story. 1st The impression calculated to be made by the fol- lowing words: \" Solomon told them that God had bestow- ed upon them a particular favour, in having permitted them to discover the most precious jewels of Masonry; by which he seemed to intimate their election,\" &c. And again; 44 God may one day permit that you may be rewarded,\" &c\\ This is magnifying most artfully: \" Viz illam famuli Phegeus Sagarisque ferebant u Multiplicem* connixi bumeris; indutusat olim u Demoleus, cursu palantes Troas agebat.\" Demoleus, wearing a coat of mail a burden for two ser- vants, drove whole squadrons of Trojans before him; and a gallant exploit it must have been to slay this same Demoleus.

The Holy Scriptures, and masonic tradition, inform us, that in the building of Solomon's temple, 3600 overseers, or masters, were employed.

These pretensions, so intimately united with the \" most ancient institution,\" that death alone can part them, I am thankful for an opportunity of stating, without jesting at their odd features, or their strange complexion. I willingly leave it to my masonic friends, whether to maintain, or to ridicule them. Deny their genuineness none can. They are drawn from the pure fountains of masonic truth; from the authorized publications of the fraternity. 3d. Such was the end of the pretended subterraneous temple, built by pretended inspiration, to preserve, as is pretended, the true name of the Most High for the benefit of the masonic fraternity I It stood water-tight nineteen centuries I capacious enough to hold 3568 ancient master masons, it no sooner received them within its dark vaults, than, without the intervention of any means, it devoured them in a moment; not one escaped the destruction. At first view this might seem miraculous; but it is only monstrous. True miracles are always wrought by the in- tervention of means. When God would punish Philfatia, and three thousand of her lords perished beneath Dagon's proud roof, Sampson stood by the two pillars which supported the temple ? \" and fttnjning all his nerves, he bowed; \" As with the force of winds and waters pent, \" \"When mountains tremble; these two massy pillar?, 4"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"26 PRETENSIONS OF FREE MASONRY, \"With horrible convulsion, to and rro, ' ** He tugged—he shook—till down they came, and drew \" The whole roof after them, with bunt of thunder, \" Upon the heads of all who eat beneath.\" * This was a miracle; but the masonic event was a mole- ster, ill-formed, hideous, and merciless; destroying not the enemies of Israel, not the assassins of Tyre, but the ge- nuine ancient master masons of king Solomon's temple.

I was aware, before venturing objections to the preten- sions of Masonry, that the materials.to frame them were not scarce; but so much more numerous are they, than I had expected, that the topics on which it was my purpose Chiefly to dwell, have not even been touched. I can give no new view of this part of the subject by farther pursuing it; and although the pretensions connected with the build- ing of Solomon's temple, have a common importance at- tached to them, entitled to peculiar attention, I pass them by for the present, confident that the sample of ancient pretensions which has been presented and amply examin- ed, is a fair specimen of the whole lot. It would be wrong to weary the reader's patience with this branch of the sub- ject, when others more interesting are pushing into view. But before I take leave of the ancient pretensions of Masonry, I will throw together those already considered, in the way of a review, stamp them genuine, and lay them up for future use. They are as follows. 1st That masonry is coeval with time. The charters, cer- tificates, diplomas, &c. of our lodges and grand lodges, &c. are almost uniformly dated Anno Liicis. Even our com- mon masonic celebrations, for the greater mysticism, are often dated, not in the year of our Lord, but in the year of Masonry, i. e. in the year of creation. 3d.

The wonderful discovery of this ineffable name, agreeably to the prophecies of Moses and of David, en- graved on a triangular plate of gold, with the admiration of kings Solomon and Hiram, at sight of the ineffable types; and the still more wonderful fact that it was \" visible in the temple* at the time St. Jerome flourished, written in the ancient Samaritan characters\" 6th. The annihilation of the subterraneous temple, and the instantaneous destruction of the master Masons of king Solomon's temple, flesh and bone, so that not a relic of them was left to soothe a friend, or to receive funeral honours. These pretensions seem to be made in contempt of com- mon sense, and there are those who will be ready to think they are made in contemptof Free Masonry; to think that these are not the genuine and unqualified pretensions of the masonic institution; and that, if in any degree connected with the fraternity, it must be through weak brethren, and extravagant Masons; men who do not give, and ought not to give, a character to the institution. Heavenly charity must have hitherto thrown this veil over their weakness. It is my unpleasant duty to remove that veil, and to show them in all their deformity; to show that they are the so- lemn and certified pretensions of the Masonic fraternity, published by its ablest advocate, and sanctioned by its high- est authorities. \" A great Mason,\" it will appear in the sequel, is an im- possible thing; but if ever man could deserve that appella-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"30 PRETENSIONS OF FREE MASONRY. tk>n, it was Col. Webb. Of amiable manners and a virtuou* life, he devoted his time to Masonry; he introduced greater order into the lectures, and uniformity into the lodges; he published ^nany editions of his Monitor, the latter editions being among the most valuable treatises upon Masonry ex- tant He came with the highest masonic claims, to the second post of honour in the masonic temple of the United States, when De Witt Clinton attained the first, being made Deputy General Grand High Priest of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of North America, when that eminent politician was made General Grand High Priest The other posts of lesser honour which fell to his lot, were some of them as follows: Grand King and Grand Scribe of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the Northern States; Past Master of Temple Lodge, Albany; High Priest of the Providence Royal Arch Chapter, &a &c. This is the Mason who has published these pretensions to the world; from his book I copy them; a book prefaced as follows: -' Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the state of R. /., Provi- dence, Jtdy 7, A. L. 5802. \" The subscribers having been appointed a committee to examine a publication by Companion Thomas & Webb, entitled, \" The Free Mason's Monitor,\" beg leave to re- port, that having attended to the subject of their appoint- ment, they are of opinion, that the said publication is re- plete with useful masonic information, and is fully entitled to the sanction of this Grand Chapter.

Extract from the records. * * Grand Sec'y.\" What further proof can be desired ? And these preten- sions are not only genuine, as coming from under the hand of one whose reputation as a Mason is higher than that of any other man in America, (the most puissant sovereigns of S. C. not excepted,) whether before or after him, and as being officially sanctioned by one of the highest, purest, and most intelligent masonic associations in the United States; but also as being commonly received, and, in their indistinct character, believed among Masons* Some intel- ligent Masons take no pleasure in contemplating them, and give them no place in their memory; hut surely these claims have passed hitherto little disputed by any of the fraternity. Masons do not generaUy hesitate to ascribe the origin of the institution to the period when their greatest men; their official papers, and their approved treatises, assert its be- ginning. Vhey do not scruple to teach the novice, that Enoch built two pillars, by which the knowledge of Ma- sonry was preserved to the descendants of Noah; to teach that Moses had the true word of the master Mason mira- culously revealed to him, which word was singularly lost and found in the days of King Solomon, when there hap* pened events important to be known, which are only known to the Free and Accepted Mason. Why should not such tales pass current upon the lips of ordinary Masons, when they are certified by the authorities of Masonry? Another highly approved Masonic work (as an edition of 12,000 copies assures us) contains the following: \" Cer- tain it is, that Free Masonry has been from the creation; (though not under that name;) that it was a divine gift from God; that there were but four Masons in the world when the deluge happened; that one of the four, even the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"32 PRETENSIONS OF FRM MASONRY. second son of Noah, was not master of the art/ 9 &c—JMiar- somc Minstrel^ p. 337. Free Masonry a divine gift from God! I have seen this assertion in more Masonic works than one. It may be a duty solemnly to charge the institution with this presump- tuous claim, but not now; and I return to say what so great extravagance called me from saying, that while such claims are boldly thrown out by the authorized publications of the fraternity, it can be op wonder that the same things are re- peated and magnified by the herd of tongues. Haidie's Monitor (p. 390;) mentions it as an important fact in maso- nic chronology, that \" during the forty years peregrination of the Hebrews in the wilderness, it pleased the Divine Architect to inspire with wisdom certain persons, who erect- ed the glorious tabernacle in which the Sbeckhinah (or Di- vine Glory) resided;\" and why should not a Free Mason say, as Free Masons do say, that the tabernacle of Moses was built by masonic art; meaning such art as was then, and is now, peculiar to Free Masonry ? Such pretensions are mon- strous ; I present them, not for any pleasure they aAbrd, but only to show that the proof of the genuineness of the kind of pretensions already offered to the reader, is pain- fully abundant; is not confined to slanderous lips, but is uniformly found in the records and papers of the Masonic fraternity. Individual Masons, were they charged with framing or maintaining these pretensions, might clear themselves. They are not charged, but the institution; and who can dear the institution ? Its pages abound in these preten- sions ; its rites depend on them; its superstructure is raked on them; its whole mystery is involved in them. Free Ma- sonry, and its pretensions, already named, with its unrea- sonable ones yet to be named, cannot be separated; take them from it, and it becomes a social club, at best a charita- ble association; it is Free Masonry no longer. Its mys- tery has fled, its glory departed, its spirit sunk for ever."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"PRETENTIONS OF FREE MASONRY.  33 Take it with its pretensions, and it is certainly liable to great objection; which is the very thing I set out to prove. N. B. Thus far this work has been publicly read by many of the fraternity, without a whisper of objection to its accuracy. Yet some of the brethren, men of inquisitive mind and good information, treated the effort with little re- spect; and, by significant signs, required the writer to utter proverbs upon fitter subjects. It is to be feared that, in imitation of the 3568 ancient Masons, they have, in their vexation, done that which will hasten the downikl of the modem mystical temple; but our masters will fare better, I hope, than those ancients, and be seen and heard of long after the total annihilation of the visionary fabric of Free Masonry.

How many spears are sharpened for the fight, cannot now be known; but truly the pretensions of Masonry have been hitherto ks eggs that are left; and al- though gathered in the open day, and in the face of the sun, \" there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.\" . Extraordinary pretensions excite suspicion; solid merit and real excellence confide in their own powers of recom- mendation, and avoid splendid professions. The magnifi- cent pretensions of Masonry, like all braggarts, are cowards: met boldly, they faint away; there is no more spirit in them. The world is full of falsehood, which ever conceals its own name. Its tendency is not on that account the less pernicious. Men may most innocently imbibe and main- tain wrong views; yet not with impunity: wrong opinions tend to wrong conduct, and error, like poison, is poison still, though taken by the unsuspecting.* The subject of Free Masonry has distressed me.

Masonry may perish, and I will not mourn, for it is an error which lies near to the hearts of thousands; yet the respect which I cannot find it in my heart to pay tho institution for its own sake, I will cheerfully pay for tho sake of those who reverence it. Many think it a very se- rious and important concern, and I will not trifle with their v opinion. I will fearlessly avow my own convictions, as a lover of truth ought to do, without indulging in mirth and jest, and lightness of remark. I will be serious. The objections I have to make, with the reasons of them, shall be given plainly, candidly, and kindly. I have to beg of my intelligent brethren to read them in the same spirit, and to decide as those who believe that error is destructive of the best interests of society, and that truth is the sole security both of our enjoyments and our hopes. I entreat those into whose hands these sheets may come, to form an opinion upon the subject, indepen- dent of the prejudices and the fears of this generation. There is a responsibility to conscience, a responsibility to the worlds and to posterity, and to a tribunal at which both Masons and Christians must answer. We owe it to our- selves, and to our final Judge, to maintain the truth for the truth's sake, confident that truth must finally prevail, and desiring that it may the more speedily triumph through our instrumentality. I know that it is a new thing for a master Mason to ob- ject, in any great degree, to the character of the masonic institution; that Washington blessed the fraternity, and Warren presided over the lodges; that it is made to bestow mercy upon the widow, humanity upon the selfish, and. civility upon the rude.

Who would not stand aloof from it ? Nay, who would not feel in duty bound to lay hold of its timbers, and prostrate it to the ground ? Reared by past ages, supported by the various interests and prejudices of men, moulded into their language, and manners, and habits of social intercourse, spread over the tiations of the earth, and serving as a common bond of union among strangers and foreigners, it cannot be brought down by a feeble, or by an injudicious effort; and its fall, with all possible care to prevent it, will produce a violent ' concussion in the community, and may make a temporary desolation around in its overthrow. Free Masonry in America is like a bad system of govern- ment in the hands of a virtuous administration; its faults are rendered nearly harmless by the purity of its magis- trates, and its advantages are heightened by the integrity of its supporters. u Why disturb its operations, then ?\" Because the good it seems to do is not its own, and will not disappear with the loss of Free Masonry; because it aims at too much, quite misleading some, and darkening the truth in many; because it offers itself in the way, of a higher, nobler, brighter, hoKer, happier institution; because pretending to have descended from the skies, to be the daughter of Heaven, \" The gift of God to the first Ma- sons ;\"* it does find a way, with its very emptiness, to serve, in many minds, as a substitute for that glorious institution, which alone is heavenly and divine. Free Masonry never opposes Christianity, or Mahomedanism, or idolatry, or any such thing. It merely offers itself in the place of either of them, as a clever thing to suit every body, and of- fend none; as a law which secures to the faithful peace on earth, and bliss in Heaven, of whatever name or nature, religion or superstition. * Book of Const, p. 19.

Men in this Christian land are not made better by their attendance upon the institutions of Free Masonry; and half the time, devoted in the lodges and in the lectures to senseless forms and ceremonies, if once devoted to the lectures, to the em- blems, and to the heaven-born doctrines of Christianity, would leave them but little relish for the table which the lodges spread; and so, also, the time spent in the lodges, and in the vain repetitions of the order, neither fit the mind, nor leave it room or relish for the simple and una- dorned truths of the Gospel. Nay, more. Men, taught by the books of Masonry that this and that wonder were wrought by Heaven for Free Masonry; and that the Most High did interest himself up- on several occasions, personally, and often by his acknow- ledged servants, the patriarchs, the prophets, and the apos- tles, to ordain, preserve, and enlarge the Masonic institu- tion ; and finding Free Masonry itself to be emptiness and vanity, are foiced to regard all religious truth with less res- pect and confidence. In this light I cannot but consider the great pretensions of the institution, as a contempt upon the Most High, and upon his chosen servants; for, if the choicest men of the antediluvian world, Adam, and Enoch, and Noah; and the holiest, the wisest, and the greatest men since the flood, Moses, and Solomon, and John Bap- tist, together with the most beloved Evangelist, were inte- rested in empty Free Masonry as the institution represents them, they must fail to be regarded in their teachings in the holy scriptures, with that entire respect and reverence* which is their due.

But gentlemen Masons of all professions, will find something new in this volume. Their avocations al- low them no leisure for the researches necessary to form any other than the common estimate of Masonry. What is good in the order they adorn, and what is bad they over- look, and it is forgotten. They think and act as their fa- thers have done in respect to Masonry, and push their in- quiries after new truth in a more grateful direction. To them I cheerfiilly commend my labour, with full confidence of a good degree of harmony in the entire abandonment of the institution. They are capable of examining, and deciding rightly upon the subject: with them I leave it, nothing doubting. But in large societies there must be great varieties, and some will be found ready to adhere to the institution after it is proved to be a fraud; will adhere to it perhaps the more closely for its being a friend in need ; a fraud detected, belonging to that class of men \" who make it a point of honour not to be disabused, and who had rather fall into a hundred errors than confess one.\" But Free Masonry has no more than a fair proportion of such men.

If I could not charge Ma- sonry without deeply implicating either their judgment, or integrity, or understanding, I would be the last man to speak evil of it If my present views of Masonry were not consistent with a high regard for the brethren, I would not pen them, I would not for a moment indulge them.

This consideration has not been wholly out of sight, neither shall it be. We cannot change the com- plexion nature has given; neither can I change, nor alto- gether conceal, those opinions which have strengthened with time, and enlarged with opportunity, to the distrust of Free Masonry. It is not a little embarrassing to one who would serve his generation in peace, to enter upon a work, which, if it could fail, would cover him with confusion, and expose him through life to contumely; and which, if it succeed, must triumph over an organized body of shrewd men, closely connected throughout the country, and able to concert and act together without all the responsibilities which attach to individuals. Some of the highest and ablest names in the country, some most esteemed in the circle of private friends, are to be gained to this enterprise, or long habits of implicit belief in masonic testimony, will lead them to denounce the work altogether. Enemies rise up; but truth, in the hands of the upright, is a spear which will find the joints of their armour, and lay open to view the entire anatomy of those who feed on error, and strengthen them- selves with delusion. While I proceed to examine the consistency of Mason- ry, as exhibited in the authorized books of the order, with the actual state of the art, as it exists in the lodges; if at any time I speak lightly of the empty trappings, of the senseless ceremonies, and the vain-glorious pretensions of Masonry; I hope to be acquitted of all intended disrespect to \" the general grand kings, thrice illustrious knights, and sublime and perfect Masons, 11 who wear, who observe, and who believe them.

The three first degrees lie at the foundation of the whole: / These I have never ceased to observe, to weigh, and to distrust, during six years of favourable opportunity; until these views of the institution have, like ripened fruit, been fully matured, and now naturally drop for the refreshment of others.

No institution in tins age can sustain claims so monstrous, though made in Mack letter. The Book of Constitutions does not say this story was published to impose on the weak; does not say that the men who copied and published it in that solemn and official manner, did not believe one word of its wonders; does not say that it is an abomination to the truth, a scandal upon common sense, a foul Mot attempted to be fixed on the escutcheon of Free Masonry; no such thing; but the Book of Constitutions relates it with perfect gravity, with a re- commendatory preface, and with explanatory notes!

It is published, also, with particular zeal by Mr. Hutchin- son, under the sanction of the Grand Lodge of England, and by Calcott, and by the renowned Master of the Lodge of Antiquity, Mr. William Preston. I wipe my hands of this, as well as the other erroneous pretensions of Masonry.

Example. A carpenter's square in the chart, is thus explained in the Monitor: u It en- ables the artist to form and fashion his works, and teaches us symbolically to form and fashion our lives.

The emblems are most of them well enough, considered merely as em- blems ; and, although they fail of affecting deeply the con- science, those who find them good are welcome to them, claiming them only as emblems, and not as the mysterious characters and dark hieroglyphics of a divine and \" mys- terious science,\"—an art u which the first Masons re- ceived from God.\" I say most of them are well enough, for I do not think they all are •, for instance, the explanation of the lamb skin, or white leather apron: it is given thus in Hardie*s Monitor, p. 140. \" The lamb has been in all ages considered as an emblem of innocence and of peace. The Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world, will grant to those who put their trust in him, his peace. He, therefore, who wears the lamb skin as a badge of Masonry, is thereby reminded of that pu- rity of life and conversation, which it is absolutely necessary for them to observe, who expect to be admitted into the Grand Lodge above; where, under the precedency of the Grand Master of heaven and earth, they will for ever enjoy those pleasures which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,\" &c* \" This lamb skin, or white apron, the person initiated is told, is more ancient than the golden fleece, or Roman eagle, more honourable than the star and garter, or any other order which could be conferred upon him, then, or at any time thereafter, by king, prince, potentate, or any other person, except he be. a Mason; and which everyone ought to wear with equal honour to himself, and to the fraternity.\" — Hardie's Mon. chap. 17. p. 141."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"60  EMBLEMS OF FREE MASONRY. A white apron is a very innocent thing in itself, and if one can learn purity of life from it, let him wear it by night and by day. But this disposition to draw in the Lamb that taketh away sin, to the support of Masonry; and to call Heaven's Ma- jesty by the heathenish names of a secret society; and to set the pleasures which God has prepared for those that love him, before cold moralists in damask aprons, deserves reproof; I cannot away with it The bragging which fol- lows, that this white apron is more honourable than any thing in the gift of kings, or princes, or people, is too child- ish to move indignation. \" Let coxcombs grin, and critics sneer, \" While we are blithe and jolly; * Let fops despise the badge we wear, « We laugh at all their folly.\" Preston, Lon. ed. 1792. p. 396. The moral attached to these emblems, is not often re- hearsed in the lodge; very seldom. How impressively, when it is done, let Masons decide. It is a vain attempt to feed the immortal mind with chaff for bread; to incul- cate a never dying hope on the sandy foundation of self- righteousness ; to prepare men for the retributions of eter- nity, by the morality of a temporal law, and thus to plant itself in the way of the true faith, and to turn men aside from the sure hope, the bright realities, and the searching doctrines of the gospel."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"CROSS'S MASONIC CHART.  61  CHAPTER XI. \" Mark you this, Bassanio, u The devil can quote scripture fer hla purpose. «* An evil soul, producing holy witness, \"Is like a villain with a smiling cheek; \" A goodly apple, rotten at the heart. \" O, what a goodly outside falsehood bath!\" Merck, of Venice. I COME next to sixteen pages of hieroglyphics in Royal Arch Masonry. These it belongs not to a Master Mason to explain; but their extraordinary character will not suffer me to pass them unnoticed. The tabernacle of the Lord built by Moses, and its utensils; the ark of the covenant and its contents; the pot of manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the two tables of the law-, the cherubim oyer the mercy seat; the table of show bread, the altar, the golden candlestick, the pot of incense, and the pontifical garments, consecrated by the Most High to his own peculiar service in the family of Aaron; constitute three fifths of the em- blems in Royal Arch Masonry! While Masonry confines itself, as it does for the most part in the three first degrees, to compasses, plumb lines, setting malls, scythes, bee hives, &c. &c. no fault can be found with the emblems, but only with the explanations of them; if such simple tools will preach morality to rational creatures, it is harmless at least; but when men take the things of the Most High, dedicated to his service, and use them as emblems of a mystical science, put they what ex- planation upon the emblems they may, the mind revolts from the sacrilege.

H to the tabernacle and to the mercy seat, in which the glory of the Highest dwelt, not to the tables of the covenant, not to the altar and golden candlestick, not to the consecrated garments of the Levitical priesthood, all which she assumes. Masonry has, properly, nothing to do with these things; she cannot use them without sacrilege. Masonry may with equal justice take for her emblems, the awful representa- tions of the Apocalypse; the seven trumpets, the seven vials, the river of water of life, ami the hew Jerusalem, and the throne of God! Masonry has, properly, nothing to do with any of these things; and to represent it otherwise, is fearful. When Mr. Cross, the grand lecturer, gives Moses with his flocks, covering his eyes on the holy ground before the Lord in the bush which burned and consumed not; and when this em- blem is sanctioned by the most excellent names of the fra- ternity, the impression conveyed, and intended to be con- veyed, is, that Free Masonry has some interesting connex- ion, to say the least, with that portentous event.* It does not become a master to speak as though he knew the se- crets of the Royal Arch; but it is proper for him to speak as one who knows the art of which he has by proper au- thorities been entitled a master; and as a lawfully consti- tuted master of the art of Free Masonry, I declare my tho- rough conviction, that Free Masonry has no more legitimate connexion with Moses and the burning bush, than it has with the seven trumpets of the Apocalypse; that it has no more rightful claim to the tabernacle and its utensils, than to the Christian sacraments for emblems. The use of common utensils for emblems is harmless, if the thing sig- nified be innocent; the use of things holy in the same way, is an abuse of them not justifiable on any conceivable ex- planation.! Therefore it is, that I am indignant to see the Holy of * The F. M.

Those solemn remembrancers of God's visible presence, and of the displays of his righteous judgments and pardoning mer- cies, to the chosen but rebellious sons of Jacob, are gravely trifled with, when made to serve in the workshop of a Free Mason, use them as he may. I cannot endure it, that an in- stitution, which, as far as I have known it, is a perfect TE~ KEL, should endeavour to compensate for its emptiness, by wresting the characters of the patriarchs to its support; that an institution which, to the end of the degree it calls sublime, is, in my sober judgment, very ridiculous, both in its rights and ceremonies, should, for the greater sanctity, draw into its use in the higher degrees, the most solemn events and sacred furniture of the ancient church. When Masonry answers it, it will be with her life. The destruction of Jerusalem, the plan of Babylon, and the maps of those ancient countries, are all free to the fra- ternity. If it can draw wisdom from such emblems, it is well: there is nothing in the sight of a burning city, and captive train, &c. &c. that may not be turned to a good account; so these the Royal Arch may have, together with its claw hammer, key, and barn shovel. But that triangle of Enoch's, so often presented to view, giving a splendid light in the darkness of the deep arches the moment is extensively circulated, and may be genuine Christianity to the exalted Mason; but to the humble master, it is simple blasphemy. Describing his ascent in the higher degrees, one says of the latter he had taken: u I be- came a pilgrim, travelled to the awful dome of the K. T. and sued for admittance. I gained it, trod the paths of my Redeemer, drank the bitter cup, was crucified with him, and triumphed over death and hell.\" This is admitted into the preface of the Free Mason's Library, p. 7, with marked approbation.

Prayer is, not an empty form ; is not a service operating only upon the heart of the peti- tioner ; but it ascends to one who hears, and will in won- derful condescension answer.

For the honour of His holy name, the words of the prayer say; but, indeed, it does not mean any such thing. He that wrote, and whoever uses the prayer, must know in his own heart, that the mighty God is not one covertly to honour his own name. Only Free Masonry does that What says Jehovah to David, his offending servant ? \" Thou didst it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun : saith the Lord.\" It is mon- strous presumption to entreat God to honour his own holy name by the greater display of the beauties of holiness through the secrets of a mystical science I Indeed, the prayer does not mean so \\ but the spirit of it is—honour Masonry, our secret art, that it may appear in his eyes hal- lowed by prayer and allied to heaven, who kneels now blindfolded, expecting something, and who will soon open his eyes upon vanity and disappointment.* The propriety of this explanation will appear the more striking, when we learn more particularly what the secret art is.

An extract from the Charge: \" No institution was ever raised on a better principle, or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down, than are inculcated in the several masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been encouragers and promoters of the art; and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity, to level themselves with the fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies.\" While Free Masonry thus exalts herself above all the forms of government and religion; above all systems of truth, and maxims of duty; and freely takes to herself the greatest and best of men of all ages, the reader may be exercising his imagination to conceive what kind of a re- velation, or heavenly wonder this secret art must be; but it a master may explain the,above, this is its meaning: the newly entered apprentice is in the greatest danger of sick- ening with disgust at the disappointment he has suffered.

To please the accomplished scholar and ingenious artist, Ma- sonry is wisely planned; and in the investigation of its latent doctrines, the philosopher and mathematician may expe- rience equal delight and satisfaction/ 9 An apprentice who would stop with such a bright pros- pect before him, must be exceedingly faithless, especially when on the same page it is added : \" To exhaust the va- rious subjects of which it treats, would transcend the pow- ers of the brightest genius; still, however, nearer approach- es to perfection may be made, and the man of wisdom will not check the progress of his abilities, though the task he attempts may at first seem insurmountable ;\"t and more, a plenty; but this is enough to lead an apprentice on to the degree of fellow craft, and to lead the uninitiated to think there is some singular mystery in Free Masonry; and as that is what such statements are intended for, we will pro- ceed next to the matter of the degree of fellow crafts, to which this is an introduction.

Without ceremony, the Chart, like the Monitor, the Ma- nual, Preston, and Book of Constitutions of South Caro- lina, &c. passes from the five senses to treat— \" Of the seven liberal arts and sciences; which are grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy.\" This enumeration shows the antiquity of Masonry; for, having always a desire for the best things, as well as the best men, of all ages, it undoubtedly chose the seven most-libe- ral and honourable of the arts and sciences of the age in which the selection was made; and some years have now elapsed since, in the estimate of the learned world, natural philosophy and chemistry would have found a place among the liberal arts and sciences. This is honourable tq the antiquity of the institution, without reproach to its discernment; and we are not to in- fer hence, that the study of natural philosophy and chemis- try is neglected by the fraternity; or because these sciences have no place of honour in the books of the craft, that, therefore, they are omitted in the instructions of the lodge room.

The good seeming to flow from it, is not its own, and will not perish with Free Masonry. In the hands of good men it is made useful; in the hands of bad men it is mischievous. The good would do more good without it, and the bad will not be strengthened by the retiring of the virtuous. But, to make the argument short, every reason which occurs, or has been offered, for the continued support of an institution justly described in the preceding pages, is equally applicable to prove that we may do evil, if good will come; and this all good men will pronounce to be heresy in a fear- ful sense. Masonry is that boasting thing already described, and on all the ground over which we have passed, it cannot be de- nied, that its great boasting is empty and vain; it is not supported by the truth, neither can it be. This is an evil; the most inveterate must allow that this is an evil which has only one palliation, viz. that it makes men reverence a use- ful institution; it is allowed and practised very commonly with this apology alone, \" that it helps to uphold an insti- tution inculcating divine maxims, and leading to righteous- ness and peace;\" a little evil done to effect a great good.

This subject is easy in itself, but exceedingly difficult in tke opposition it meets. Having been induced to join the fraternity, by the solemn and reiterated claims of Free Ma- sonry to peculiar excellence, and a most ancient origin, I am compelled either to countenance its claims by silence, while others proclaim them; or to reply with reason. To countenance them, is to take a part of the responsibility for their truth, and to reply is singular. Fen- their truth, I can be in no degree responsible; and have no way left but to be singular. Telemachus refused \" sauver sa vie par un men- songe,\"t and many generations have applauded the Arch- bishop Fenelon for this stern integrity of his hero. I will not consent to uphold Free Masonry by means which an honourable man scorns for the saving of his Ufe. Truth is worth every thing besides; why sacrifice it upon the shrine of Free Masonry ? That Free Masonry requires the sacri- fice, is proof enough that it is unworthy of the countenance it receives.

But the mole will have the eyes of the lynx before Free Ma- sonry enables her pupil \" to hold converse with the spirit of other ages, .while he reads on every mossy stone, mystic chronicles\" &c. No; I greatly fear that she, who in the three first degrees, boldly contradicts the truth for her own praise, is, through Mr. S., piaking, in the higher degrees, a vigorous effort, by deceit and falsehood, to sustain her repu- tation. I can neither hear nor read such claims advanced in a public assembly before the highest dignitaries of Free Ma- sonry, andpublished in the official records of the fraterni- ty t without revolting from all participation in the deed; I will be no accessary either before or after the act. \" Why ?—what hurt do they do ?\" It is possible, because it is true, that enlightened and good men seriously put and sometimes urge this question. I answer, as to a friend, that these pretensions are edge topis, with which it is dangerous to play; fables which, though they deceive not the learned, do miserably impose on the multitude; at best, white lies, which the judicious Paley de- clares are apt to lead to those of a darker hue. But they do the hurt that positive and reiterated asser- tions of the weightiest import ever do, when entirely groundless, or sustained only by some concealed catch, or double entendre.

So Noah and John were build- ers, the one of the ark, the other, in the gospel; and are railed Masons, and Free Masons, on this ground alone. Truth is of a character too sacred to be trifled with after this manner. Such pretensions do harm; they are an ex- ample of prevarication, which, followed in youth, leads to baser falsehood in old age. They corrupt the confiding temper of the young; they harden the vicious heart; they tempt the tyro in deception ; \" men do these things,\" ex- claims his passion, \" and yet are good and great.\" They defile the land. When I look around, and behold the political lies told for the salvation of the country, which is depending on the election of a favourite candidate ; the lies of bargain and sale, told for the accumulation of what is necessary to put cvgry man his family above the reach of want; the lies of scandal greedily caught up and circulated, that no aristo- cracy of virtue may be allowed to establish itself in this republican community; and know that the Lodges per- vade the land, and that Masonry is warranted and justified in doing what is severely condemned in the others mention- ed, I cannot doubt that her example goes far to encourage in men this disposition to glorify a false God for the attain- ment of their several purposes, and for the gratification of their ardent desires. What privilege has Masonry to trifle with the truth, that is not common to all ? What the brother, to trifle for the benefit of virtue and Masonry, which will not warrant him in the like for virtue and his country ? for virtue and him- self—for his pelf, for his party ? If, to advance virtue and Masonry, one may say, that\" Masonry the first Masons re- ceived from God,\" [Booh of Cons. p. 19.] then may one for the support of his own purse and family, cry in the market, \" this is a good horse.\" which is blind of both"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"FREE MASONRY A PIOUS FRAUD.

If the pretensions of Masonry are other than equivocations, they are of a darker hue, and must be met by flat contradiction; but as brethren with whom I have the honour to converse, choose to maintain them on the ground of white tie*, harm- less deceit, pious frauds, I meet them on that ground; meet them seriously, and urge, that if a Mason may say. \" Masonry includes within its circle almost every branch of polite learning; under the veil of its fnysteries is compre- hended a regular system of science;\" [Mon. chap. 10. p. 50; also, Preston^ book 2, sec. 4, and Free Mason's Li- brary , p. 165, the same words.] then may any man say, \" Benedict Arnold is a pattern of patriotism ;\" provided only, that if an honest man say it, he has some honourable pur- pose to attain. This ia a terrible mistake in morals; mak- ing a good end justify unholy means; making virtute ad- vance by the help of vice; the majesty of heaven honour- ed by disobedience to the command, \" thou shalt not bear false witness;\" the truth of God advanced by our false- hood.

This is an important argument to show the falsity of the tradition. All the Manuals of Free Masonry, in illus- trating the mark master's degree, say, \" that men of this degree at the erection of Solomon's temple, were enabled, without difficulty, to ascertain who was the faulty workman, in case any defect appeared in the work.\" Masons are never mark masters until after being made masters. And if there were masters and mark masters at the building of the temple, and superintending the work, what was their sign, token, grip and word ? And what be- comes of the reiterated declaration, that Solomon and the Hirams were at that time the only Masters in the world ? We have 3,600 masters, and an unknown number of mark masters;—and none but the three possessed of the master's word, &c.! As the Inspector General declares: \" Nil fuit unquam \" Sic impar ribi.\" Never was any thing so contradictory. Suppose there were 3,600 ancient masters besides mark masters, as masonic tradition informs; and that the ruf- fians passed by them to assault the Grand Master; the first rufiian struck him with the working tool of an entered ap- prentice, on the sign of the apprentice's obligation ;> the se- cond, with the working tool of a fellow craft, gave his blow on the sign of the fellow craft's obligation; and the third gave his blow with the master's mall, and neither struck * twice, though death ensued.

The pursuers, only twelve in number, depart in triplets, east, west, north, and south, and return without success; threatened with death if they fail, they alone depart in triplets as before.

But if they were together in a gloomy cavern, repenting, as represent- ed, it is wholly incredible that they should have been so particular in their imprecations, and yet so various; that each should have preferred a claim to death under circum- stances much more horrid and minute than I have repeated, without having the manner of one, similar to that of the other, in any one material point!"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"DR.

Besides, none reach the sublime degrees without passing through the barren waste of the lodges; and they of the chapters and encampments are no more delighted with their secrets, and discoveries, and mysteries, than your masters are with theirs.

What is the tradition? That Solomon and the two Hi- rams often retired to the secret vault of the temple for the study of Masonry. How could this be ? The King of Tyre had a great go- vernment at home to manage; he could not spend his months at Jerusalem, probably not less than 130 miles dis- tant ; and post coaches did not run on the roads of Galilee in that day; nor have kings been in the habit of visiting foreign parts without a retinue, which forbids rapidity of motion: he could not go up, then, to lodge meetings at Je- rusalem, if they had been most worthy of his attendance. How this affair is to be accommodated I know not; let the reader decide.

The three degrees are emblematic of three divine dispen- sations of grace, the Antediluvian, the Mosaic, and the Christian. (New Man.

All their excel- lence, however, is as free of Masonry as the cloak is free of the back it covers; it forms no part of the man, nor does the character of the wearer affect the value of the cloak. Masonry has adopted many perfect rules of conduct; but they will live when she is dead; they will feel no pang when she expires. The mockery of truth and Heaven, by the prayer found in the Book of Constitutions, and Monitor, and Chart, as already quoted; which is found also in Calcott's Disquisi- tions, p. 199. \" Endue him with divine wisdom, that he may, with the secrets of Masonry, be able to unfold the mysteries of Godliness and Christianity;\" found also in the Masonic Manual, p. 137., is a presumptuous and deceitful supplication, as every novice does seriously fear by the end of the first lodge night. But, bid on all hands to smother his fears, and to advance to the sublime degree of a Master Mason,* before he in- dulges his disappointment, the candidate becomes a fellow craft. , This is the degree which treats of the five senses, the five orders of architecture, and the seven liberal arts and sci- ences, if we can believe the testimony of the Chart, Moni- tors of all descriptions, Manual of Masonry from p. 169. to 189., and Preston 62. to 72., and Book of Cons. S. C. p. 62. to 85., and F. M. Library, 165. to 180.; and contains espe- cially, that singular art of discovering divine truth by geo- metrical solutions. (New Mm. p. 157.) Summing up the particulars taught in this degree, Mr. Preston gravely adds: \" Besides a complete theory of phi- losophy and physics, this lecture contains a regular system * This is the common term among masonic authors for the third degree."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"MASONIC DEGREES.  Ill  of science, demonstrated on the clearest principles, and es- tablished on the firmest foundation.'\"* Morals in the first degree, physics, and all the arts and sciences, in the second, or fellow craft's degree, history alone is left for the master's degree; and Masonry, being \" wisely planned to please the accomplished scholar,\" (Man., Preston <$• Co.) in this degree, \" recites the tradi- tions of the order, and presents to view a finished picture of the utmost consequence to the fraternity;\" viz, that \" in- stance of virtue, fortitude and integrity\" exhibited in the death of Hiram Abiff. All this is done in the three first degrees, it would seem, by the words of these masonic authors; what is left for the remaining degrees to teach ? We have the mark master's next; suppose that teaches \" the universal language which survived the confusion of Shinar, (i. e. Babel,) and, to our great consolation, has been handed down to posterity.\"t {Hutchinson*s Sp. of Masonry, p. 6. and 131.) The alphabet of this strange tongue would be enough, perhaps, for the mark degree; and as even that is not taught in the lodges, it would seem inexcusable to post- pone it longer. The past master's degree may teach the grammar of the same tongue. The most excellent masters will translate a little, the royal arch will pursue the same study for aught I see, in the want of something else to do, and the royal * Book of Const S. C. p. 85. F. M.

It is difficult to conceive what they are doing, unless they are helping the lodges, as Harry and Dick were helping John to do nothing. It must strike every one as mysterious, that off the liberal arts and sciences should be huddled into one degree of Ma- sonry, and that the second. With proper economy they might have been distributed among the 33 or 53 degrees of the order, and have served a valuable purpose as pretensions ; but, crowded together where they are, they choke our cre- dulity with their prodigious bulk, and leave the superior de- grees destitute of thq semblance of an art or science to support life and character. This shows that the higher de- grees are illegitimate children, having a shelter under the paternal roof, but not a cent of the inheritance. And now, reader, we have travelled through the lodges, with a short flight to the sublime degrees, carefully inspect- ing the pretensions of Free Masonry, and exposing her va- nity and emptiness.

But observe, that none can open a master** lodge on a degree above the third degree in Masonry. The degrees above are a late invention, and belong to the chapters, &c.; with them I have nothing to do:—let them live; the three first degrees, which are embodied in lodges, and governed by the officers here explained, are alone under consideration.

This was the prelude to some business, and served the purpose of gain- ing the attention of the children. Its striking similarity t both in manner and design, to the masonic ceremonies of opening and closing the lodges of the different degrees, would induce one to think it must have been adopted from the lodges into the schools; but in the schools it has an im- provement in respect to simplicity, and in being a prelude to business of importance. A lodge of masters does never regularly open on the third degree, until after having ceremoniously opened and closed the two preceding. In this way apprentices and fellow crafts are regularly paid their wages and dismissed, leaving the masters to themselves. But any business properly be- longing to a particular degree, is done while the lodge is open on that degree, that all interested may have qn op- portunity to act. What can the lodges be doing one night in a month ? Every society, whether of agriculturists, mechanics, or philanthropists, will find something to entertain and engage them when they meet in conclave. They have by-laws to make and repeal, and enforce and waive ; and so have the lodges.

These things would not keep men together long even- ings once in a month, nor bring them together, only as they serve another turn. In the lodge the politician gains in- fluence, the tradesman makes friends and customers, the mechanic secures employers, and various minds in various callings meet and communicate upon various interests, with a good degree of freedom, and confidence, and social plea- sure. They pay no more respect to vain Masonry than this; she brings them together, and helps them each to gain his own ends, only demanding from him in return, that atten- tion to her forms and ceremonies which is necessary to her existence, and that they give. It is a school of discipline to the ambitious; an apology for an entertainment to the convivial; and a distinguished opportunity for the selfish, as well as a season of recreation to the labourer.

It will not seem strange to the reader, that the time should be fully taken up with these things one evening in a month, when he recollects, that Masonry intrusts nothing to wri- ting which relates to her numerous signs,-tokens, &c. and to her varied catechisms and lectures, and to her tradition. It must all be learned by dictation, and that is no small affair, especially when it is considered how much more diffi- cult to commit a senseless thing is, than any matter of com- mon sense, and of impressive import. Few men, having on hand the usual cares of life, can afford time for the tedious operation; but young minds, aspiring to the official stations of the lodge, and to be distinguished in the crowd on some public occasion, as great Masons, apply themselves to the task, day by day, and night after night, and make suitable proficiency. This is called lecturing, because the advanced Mason dic- tates while the others learn. I hope it is no breach of trust in me, no contempt of my masonic obligations, to say, that the rehearsed of these things, accompanied by the exercise of the manual, consti- tutes that business in modern lodges signified by the word work —work over which the master presides, and in which all the brethren assist. The term makes an important figure in the treatises on Masonry; and while every one may know, from the stillness of the lodge room, that the temple of the lodges, like that of our ancient grand master, is erected without the sound of a hammer; and from the state of the room after the lodge have retired, that no rubbish is there sufficient to conceal the baseness of any improperly 16"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"1^2  PBEE MASONRY. aspiring fellow crafts of this generation; and so, that the term work, as used by modern artists, must have a significa- tion different from its common acceptation; yet one would scarcely suspect it had an application so very humble, as to signify the dictation or repetition of the masonic catechism, and the rehearsal of all those senseless peculiarities by which Masonry entwines her votaries of every country in one mystic band; but it does mean neither more nor less. I have pleasure, for the sake of my friends in the lodges, of stating one other employment which much better occu- pies a portion of their, time. It is the exercise of that grace which covers a multitude of sins. The fees of ad- mission are not uniform throughout the country, but they every where amount to a large sum, a part of which goes to erect and to furnish the hall, to purchase the regc&ia, &c, and another part to support and comfort poor widows and orphans of Masons. This is a charity confined to its circle, and useful there; and though limited in its opera- tions, and sometimes perverted from its course, it does go far to engage friends of a pure purpose to the support of theinstitution, go far to cover the nakedness of the lodges, and may serve as an open door for any to escape whole from the tottering edifice who will; but as true charity is not dependent upon any invention of man, it is unneces- sary, for its sake, to sacrifice immutable truth to Free Ma- sonry.

I am bold to follow so high masonic autho- rity, notwithstanding a trifling dilemma in which it seems involved; not unlike that of the origin of the royal arch degree. Masonic history asserts, that Adam and his sons were Free Masons; it would seem absurd, then, to say that Noachida, was the first name of Free Masons. But, doubtless, that Mesourania, which unites men of the most opposite tenets in one sacred band, can reconcile this discrepance with perfect harmony. \" TIB Masonry unites mankind; \" To generous actions forms the soul; \" In friendly converse all conjoined, \" One spirit animates the whole.\"—OW Song."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"HUTCHINSON'S SPIRIT OF MASONRY. 127 doubt, since rocks were handled by architects,*) and the vanity of the pretension sinks into the most lowly humility, and its seeming falsehood is converted into self-evident truth.

And to operative Masons, who know the use of plumb lines and squares, shovels and common gavels, rough ashler, perfect ashler, and trestle board, the ceremonies of Masonry may in some parts be delightful and pro- fitable. Such will enjoy the lines placed at the head of this chapter. True Masons know the meaning of the lines, and relish them. But pretended Masons, ignorant of the art, would understand, u True your joints break,\" in a literal sense ; and so pretend broken limbs. \" Take care that you follow your leaders,\" they would separate from all connexion with operative Masonry, and apply it as a rule to obey the grand officers. \" Work, rake, back, and tueth ;\" that would be to them the secret: a mystery inexplicable. \" And be sure that you fill up your headers,\" would be understood in a convivial sense. A thousand times worse perverted is Free Masonry. Having come into the hands of lords and gentlemen and tailors, most of whom have not the smallest idea of the pe- destal, column and entablature; the plinth, the die and the surbase; and finding the terms of Masonry either vulgar, as brick and mortar, or obscure, as \" ledgers and putlocks,\" they think the very brick and mortar has some hidden mean- ing, known only to the gifted Mason; and \" the ledgers and putlocks,\" (pudlogs. Walker,) are terms of the universal language, which has come down to Masons uncorrupted from the plains of Shinar; and which they, poor fellows, have not had opportunity to learn yet; and so it is that the plain noun Masonry, which every child knows to mean the art of building with brick, and stone, and mortar, is made to come from the t Greek, Mi#vg«M»; SUM in medio Coelf; AnglicS, lam in the midst of heaven.

If Mr. Hutchinson was mad, my Lord Petre, and Mr. Holt, and Mr. Noel, &c. ought not to have recommended his labour, and Mr. Preston should not have quoted his work as follows: \" Mr. Hutchinson, in bis ingenious trea- tise entitled, The Spirit of Masonry.\"* And, if Mr, H. were in his right mind, he should not have asked the follow- ing questions, p. 170. u If our ceremonies mean not the matter which I have expressed; if they imply not the moral and religious principles which I have endeavoured to unveil; I ask you, MASONS, what they do imply, import or indi- cate?\" (Because they are senseless and ridiculous, he thinks they must be unearthly, heavenly, divine.) \" Can we presume so many learned and noble personages would, for many successive ages, have been steady members of the fraternity, if the mysteries were unimportant, and the ceremonies unintelligible?

On the lips of labouring Masons they have a literal, and natural, and honest meaning; but with those, like Mr. Hutchinson, who cannot bear to think of any. thing beneath the highest display of Heaven's mercy, in connexion with the paltry ceremonies of a nocturnal so- ciety, they are made to mean science, and art, and magic, and religion, indiscriminately, and the folly of one has been so played off, as to beguile a thousand. Previous to 1717, Masonry was this honest society of labourers; but then a change was introduced, and modern or speculative Masonry sprung up.

They might, they do; but such would not have strength to labour in the ancient lodges of operative masons. These ancient charges are found in most manuals of Ma- sonry. They are various, but generally correspond with the following, extracted from \"New Monitor,\" p. 208. \" Thirdly. You must conduct yourselves as men of ho- nesty and integrity, and serve your master in such manner as may be most conducive to his honour and profit.\" u Sixthly. Wherever you go, you shall be careful to pay for your board and lodging,\" &c. \" Some other charges, which equally demand your atten- tion. \" First. No Mason should take upon him his master's work, or any other person's, unless he is conscious to him- self that he is able to perform it in such manner as will not injure the craft. \"Second. No master shall take work without a reasona- ble compensation : nor shall any master or fellow supplant another in regard to employment. \" Third.

How natural among men of a trade is that charge, \"no master shall take work without a reasonable compensation.\" And not less necessary is that which follows it: u nor shall any master supplant another in regard to employment ;\" that is to say, if one brother is undertaking a job, another shall not rob him by underbidding. This is suitable to the art of compacting bricks and mortar; but what it has to do with the 1 art M«T»^,I«, Sum in medio coeli, lam in the midst of heaven, is a MYSTERY, of which Mr. Hutchinson, my Lord Petre, and others, think the explanation either ridiculous, or glorious: as saith the poet, \" Hail, mysterious, hail, glorious Masonry.\" The history of the craft will abundantly show the fitness of its emblems with its origin; aprons and trowels belong only to brick and mortar; and the mystical application of the terms to the use of a secret society is a perversion, by which they become, \" High words, that bear \" Semblance of worth, not substance.\" This is the true key to the mystery of Free Masonry. At first, a combination of honest labourers, to protect each other from the oppressions of the feudal barons, and to command their own price for their labour, they, like ninety other crafts and trades in London, met in fraternities.

Previous to 1717, there Was (I think it will appear) no Free Masonry, but only Masonry ; neither speculative Ma- sonry, but only operative Masonry. But when other trades and professions were admitted into the lodges, .Masonry was only speculative to the newly accepted Masons, and began to be spoken of as both operative and speculative. Now it became Free Masonry, and passing as it has done entirely out of the hands of operative Masons, into the hands of speculative Masons, it is to them truly a mystery. They know nothing about the setting mall, the ashler, and the level, technical terms of operative Masonry. The whole subject becomes to them, like the line of the poet: \" Rake, back, and toeth;\" a great secret—genuine Free Masonry. This explanation of the origin of Free Masonry is easy and natural, and is well supported by facts. If the frater- nity h^ve great doubts upon the subject, those doubts will be much diminished by a perusal of the history of Mason- ry since the beginning of the 18th century, as given by Lawrie, and Preston, and Smith, all faithful Masonic writers, who agree to state, that after 1790, Free Masonry passed from the Grand Lodge of London to the numerous places in the four quarters of the earth with which Great Britain had a colonial or commercial intercourse : the name of the Grand Master, the date of the warrant to a year, and the place where it was sent, are particularly stated by each of these Masonic historians :* and the fact goes far to prove * These facts are also stated in the Encyclopedia Britannica, Art.

ONE difficulty remains to perplex the reader, viz. \" If this is Free Masonry, how has it been endured so long?\" A hard question, which admits of an answer. But suppose it do not admit of an answer ? Is it, therefore, to overset a series of well established facts ? Because we can not tell how the Franklin rod attracts the lightning, shall we doubt its attractive power ? The fact is established, be the explanation what it may. Again, the question may admit of an answer, and yet through infirmity, the writer may fail to give it. The planets cease not to run their several circuits, though Des Cartes' theory of their motions was never satisfactory, and is now quite exploded. Should I fail, then, in an attempt to answer this question, the facts stated with respect to it remain unabated; and should the following argument seem as hypothetical as Des Cartes 9 theory, the planets are not more true to the sun, than the facts of this treatise are to Free Masonry. \" How then has it been endured so long ?\" Men have been ever fond of strange things.

Indeed, to read of ani- mals, and vile insects, honoured with religious worship, placed in temples, and maintained with great care at an extravagant expense; to read that those who murdered them were punished with death, and that these animals were embalmed, and solemnly deposited in tombs, assigned them by the public; to learn that this extravagance was carried to such a pitch, that leeks and onions were acknow- ledged as deities, were invoked in necessity, and depended upon for succour and protection ; are absurdities which we, at this distance of time, can scarcely believe; and yet they have the evidence of all antiquity. 11 [Rolling vol. i. p. 116.] This superstition is a matter of historical fact: how could"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"148  FREE MASONRY. it have been endured a moment ? Free Masonry, making every allowance, offers nothing in absurdity equal to it. The crocodile, the rat, the cat, &c. are found by modern travellers, embalmed by the side of their deluded worship- pers. The children of Abraham, distinguished by the most as- tonishing miracles, taught by the prophets, and possessed of the oracles of God, had neither eyes to see, nor hearts to understand, neither knowledge nor understanding to say of their idols of wood, \" I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also, I have baked bread upon the coals of it; I have roasted flesh and eaten it; and shall I fall down to the stock of a tree.\" [Isaiah, ch. 44.] Making every allowance, Free Masonry furnishes nothing in absurdity to equal this. How could it have been endur- ed for a moment ? Pass to the Greeks, that high-spirited people, that nation of philosophers and heroes, to whom the rest of mankind were barbarians. They believed in the divinity and the vices of Jupiter, the oracles of Apollo, the labors of Her- cules, and the innumerable fables of a ridiculous mytholo- gy ; Socrates, their highest boast, in his last moments, so- lemnly reminding his friends of the rooster, due to the dei- fied Doctor Esculapius. This entirely surpasses the follies of Free Masonry, and yet it is undeniably true, and the Sovereign Inspector General might declare it so without fear of contradiction.

We are, unfortunately, independent of antiquity for ex- amples of this sort. Man is the same inconsistent being in all ages of the world, in all stages of civilization. Idola- try, superstition, and imposture, have not ceased from the earth. Folly is not confined to Free Mason lodges. One half of the human race are now the miserable victims of a faith scarcely superior to the worship of leeks and onions: one fifth, a brave, and honest, and intelligent people, are the followers of the false prophet—to this day, the dupes of the Mahommedan imposture; and when we come to our own family of men, we find the enlightened and philoso- phic, the liberal and pious of Christendom, divided into the worshippers of images and saints, and the rebels from the authority of the Pope; each to the other no less strange, unaccountable, and absurd, than Free Masonry is to the reader. An ancient, and yet a modern fact, more hideous and unnatural than any yet mentioned, but perfectly sure, is: \" Pilate said, whom will ye that I release unto you, Barrab- bas or Jesus, who is called Christ ? And they say unto him, Barrabbas: they cried out all at once, not this man, but Barrabbas. \" And he released unto them him that for sedition and mtirder was cast into prison, whom they had desired: but he delivered Jesus to their will.\" Their preference was meditated^ was expressed with loud clamour ; u away with this man !\" And millions of the people favoured of heaven, children of faithful Abraham and chosen Israel, have steadily, for eighteen centuries, maintained the obstinate unbelief of their fathers, and do yet maintain it.

So with Free Masonry; if not believed, it is practised as if it were: if the leaders are wiser, they still have their reasons for teaching, enforcing, extending, and maintaining it. Have we no more sense than the men of Israel ? No understanding to say, a part of it I have burned; and shall I make the residue therepf an abomination ? A large part of it I know to be false; shall I make the residue my religion ? It is evident that the wisest nations, in their best days, have fallen into greater errors than this of Free Masonry; and that the men who might be supposed to know better, have either encouraged, or yielded to the folly. This is precisely the ground on which our order stands. The mul- titude are duped by it; and the knowing ones either yield, to, or encourage the folly. This is my answer, generally, to the question, \" how could it be endured so long ?\" At another time, I will give particular reasons for the appear- ance of the names of Washington, Warren, George IV., Frederick the Great, &c. upon the rolls of the fraternity. \" Sufficit huic diei sua vexatio.\" * \" Stultorum infinitus est numeruB.\""},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"MENTAL DUPRAVITV.  151  And must this great society, this mighty society, which has waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies, and has kings for her grand masters, and the princes of the earth for her priests and ministers; which saith in her heart, \"I sit as a queen and am no widow, and shall see no sor- row ;\" must she be numbered with the superstitions and im- postures which have deceived mankind; must she pass away and be found no more at all ?* Indeed, I think so;—let those who will, take up the la- mentation, (not given for the mourners on this particular occasion, yet so admirably suited, that may I be pardoned for introducing it) \"Alas!

In the common intercourse of the fraternity in this country, she does claim, it is true* most effectually to execute what Christianity was intended to accomplish, the establishment of fraternal relations among all the sons of Adam; but this without the most distant idea of representing herself to be a very efficient character, and Christianity feeble; no, no; \" the universal principles of the art unite men of the most opposite tenets, of the most distant countries, and of the most contradictory opinions, in one indissoluble bond of af- fection;\" (F.

They sought the deliverance of their country from foreign sway.. One who works against the ruling powers of any form of government, will find Free Masonry, as Weishaupt did in working againdt all forms of government, a good tool. Many officers of our revolutionary army, for pastime, and a confederacy to sustain them under their peculiar trials and dangers, fell into the arms of Free Masonry. They were regarded as rebels,, without being paid like patriots; and so it was, for whatever reason, Free Masonry first flou- rished in our country, through the struggle for our national independence. Why Frederick the Great was engaged in the lodges, will appear in the sequel. That the present king of England* while Prince of Wales, presided over the lodges of England, may be accounted for by the use then made of Free Masonry on the continent of Europe, to destroy, not only every throne, but every form of government. He, as heir to a throne, would take care for it: and how better, than by heading and thus guiding the most powerful engine of attack level- led against the Bourbons of France ?

She discourses upon religion and mo- rality, like a saint; and pretends to guide her followers to a blessed immortality. They find the white oak and the lake, two truths; but the main thing is false: Free Ma- sonry is a blind guide. She pretends that \" the WORD in the first verse of St. John, in all its relations to man, time, and eternity, constktUes the very spirit and essence of speculative Free Masonry :\" Town's Spec.

What! not be able to take a degree of Masonry in all Great Britain higher than the third, or sublime degree of master Mason ? How must the masonic reader be surpri- sed to hear it: it is not credible: yet the most excellent grand master affirmed that it was so. \" How do they manage in the master's degree, where our lodges give a substitute for the lost word ?\" \"They give the word at once,\" he replied, \"andthe chase ends there. 9 '' , I have heard that the British have a portion of good sense, and was inclined to believe this true friend of An- cient Free Masonry; but the affair was too important to rest upon individual testimony.

Preston's Illustrations of Masonry pretend, to give a full and perfect illustration of all the degrees, public ceremo- nies, and forms of Free Masonry. He takes no notice of any degree in Masonry higher than the master's. But in the historical part of his later editions, lie mentions the for- mation of the Harodim Chapter, A.

Hutchinson's Spirit of Masonry, published in 1764, treats liberally of the three degrees, and of the three only. He speaks of the royal arch; but indistinctly, and does not account it a fourth degree of Masonry. He was a man who would not have spared to honour the glorious craft, Mesourania, with higher degrees,- had they been known then to English Masons. Jachin and Boaz professes to give a perfect key to all the arcana of Free Masonry, without kn intimation of a degtee above the lodges: that was published about 1770.

It is very plain; I wonder at Masons' having made so much difficulty about the matter. Our author says, (p. 58.) \" All civilized nations admit, that Solomon most probably was a Mason; and the fact is admitted from the circumstance of his building the temple.

Just as far, therefore, as the mind was led, through this medium, to contemplate the divine plan in the economy of redemption, just so far Ancient Masonry [or geometry] in- volved ancient Christianity.\" [p. 85.] P. 86. u A knowledge, belief, and due reverence of the divine WORD, constitutes the very essence of all true religion, whether ancient or modern. St John begins his gospels, by saying, \" in the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with. God, and the WORD was God. This WORD, how- ever mysterious it may appear to the world, has been un- derstood and held sacred by the masonic order, from time immemorial.\" This is singularly edifying to masonic brethren of Jewish And Turkish families.

The grand chaplain and his chapter are of the Christian persuasion, since they connect Free Masonry only with Christianity in their eulogiums, and show at full length the coincidence of the craft and divine revelation. I am not acquainted with Chinese or Arabic, else I would make an effort to find a parallel in the manner of Mr. Town, between their reli- gious schemes, and Free Masonry. But every reader can imagine the character of such a parallel, from a perusal of Mr. Town's, and a moment's reflection upon the follow- ing statement: \" When the lodge is closed, each departs untainted by the other; the Jew to his synagogue, the Mahometan to his mosque, and the Christian to his church, as fully impressed as ever, with the divine origin and rectitude of his own faith, from the principles of which he has never for one moment deviated, either in thought or deed.\" (New Moni- tor, p. 110.)

Besides, \" as Masons, we belong to the oldest Catholic re- ligion :\" {Ahiman Rezon, p. 30.) and as this is more an- cient than the Christian era, there is a natural propriety in preserving independence. \" Ours is the true religion,\" says a Mahommedan, \" and Abraham was a true believer; he was neither Jew, Christian, nor Idolator. But what ren- ders our religion more especially holy and admirable, is its being the only one which makes alms-giving an essential duty.\" This is also the boast of Free Masonry. \" The dunce, he imagines that science and art « Depend on some compact or magical part; u Thus men are so stupid, to think that the cause \" Of our constitution's against divine laws. \" Each profession and class of mankind must agree, \" That Masons are jovial, religious, and free, \" Religions and free* Ahiman Rezon. \" The Chinese, the Algerine, the Persian, the native of Indostan, the Turk, and the Jew, may, under the masonic banner, associate in love with their Christian brethren, and participate of all the benefits of the institution.\" (Mas. Mir. and M. L p. 273.) They could not associate in love, if the Lord Jesus were named by any in adoration; so, for the sake of peace, this name is altogether omitted. Truly \"mutual toleration in religious opinions, is one of the most distinguishing and valuable characteristics of the craft;\" (Preston, 29.) and Mr. Town has erred in say- ing, \" if we would add universal celebrity to our institution, the world must be convinced, that the foundation is laid in evangelical truth.\" (Town, 14.)

Let him who believes it, purchase the book; but there is no need; hear Mr. Smith once more, p. 330. Masons put on white raiment as a type of innocence. \" The Druids were apparelled in white at the time of their sacrifices. , The Egyptian priests of Osiris, wore snow white cotton. The Grrecian, and most other priests, wore white garments; as Masons, we regard the principles of those who were the first worshippers of the true God, and. imitate their apparel\" Put these extracts of Smith together, and they fairly prove, that \" Glorious Masonry\" comprises all divine inspi- ration in its Book of Constitutions; and at the same time, inculcates the principles of the Druids, Egyptians, and Greeks, with perfect harmony. \" Pray make no mistake, M But true your joints break,\" &c.

By John G. Stearns, Pastor of the First Baptist Church in Paris, New-York.\" This little work, published early in 1826, was not sought by the public until after the abduc- tion in that same year, awakened attention to the claims of Free Masonry. It fell into my hands under circum- stances grateful to memory, and at a time when the mind was agitated and tossed between the manifest disparity of the promises and the rewards of Masonry; between its pretensions and the truth; its wise and learned supporters, and its ridiculous tradition and ceremonies. Mr. Stearns treats only of the religious pretensions of Free Masonry, leaving all other claims of the most ancient and honourable institution to make their own way in the world; but his work helped greatly to settle my convic- tions, to confirm my purposes, to encourage and counte- nance this effort. His manner will be seen in the following extract from his 44 Inquiry,' 1 chap. iv. \" The meekness of Christ does not characterise the ma- sonic institution.

How can Masonry produce or nourish this spirit, when it is said to unite men of the most opposite tenets, and of the most contradictory opinions ? u The spirit of Masonry is the spirit of the world, and not of Christ. Christianity lays aside every needless orna- ment, every thing that glitters, and every thing the world admires, and passes through it like a still small voice; often unobserved by the great, except as an object of ridicule and contempt. Not so with Masonry ; its parade is well known, and is often seen, jn pompous ceremonies, and em- blems, and splendid attire, which dazzle the eyes of gazing multitudes. The world has no war with this; it is perfect- ly congenial with its spirit But how far, how very far from the spirit of Christianity. Call a man a high priest of Ma- sonry ; clothe him in all the insignia of his office; write HO- LINESS TO THE LORD on his front; does he look like an humble disciple of Jesus? \" Christianity teaches the doctrine and precepts of mo- rality in plain language, in a plain simple manner; but Masonry pretends to teach them by a routine' of ceremo- nies. The former is God's method; the latter is man's. \" Masons may tell us, that certain things in their institu- tion are designed to teach certain truths, and to be emblems of certain virtues; but by whose authority ? and what in- struction can they give us from these things ? Where has the Lord informed us, in his word, that a chisel, a mallet, a square, a compass, a troivel, a scythe, and a white leather apron, are emblems of the virtues of the human heart, and are designed to inculcate moral truth ? Mr. Town tells us, 1 that a habitual practice of every commendable virtue, is taught by suitable and appropriate masonic emblems; 9 also, ' in a word, the history of nature and grace is most beautifully prefigured in a hvely display of masonic sym- bols.' (pp. 184.24.) u Now, the Almighty has taught us these things in his"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"224 REV. MR.

I may say that my candle and snuffers before me, are emblems of the virtues of the heart, and are de- signed to teach moral truth; I should be as nobly employ- ed, should I attempt to communicate religious instruction from these to lost, dying men, as from a chisel, or a mallet. My authority is as good in one case as in the other.\" This is good sense, and it came upon my ear like pure water upon parched lips, soothing, refreshing, and strength- ening. With a view to make Mr. Stearns 9 effort better known, and at the same time to touch the most ancient in- stitution on a point that otherwise might be overlooked, I continue to extract from the same fourth chapter of \"Steams' Inquiry.\" 1 \" There is something worthy of notice respecting the dedication of masonic lodgGs and halls. 'Our ancient breth- ren,' says Mr. Bradley,' dedicated their lodges to king So- lomon ; yet Masons professing Christianity, dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist, who were eminent patrons of Masonry.' (p. 59.) Has Mr. B. any proof that these two men were Masons ? If he has, it would have been important to Masonry had he produced it. No proof is offered, and there is none to offer, unless it be masonic tradition. This may satisfy Masons, but it ne- ver will satisfy those who think for themselves. We are at liberty to reject the proposition, and to believe that those men were not Masons; (and we take the liberty;) and when Masons say they were, they say what they cannot prove. In dedicating their lodges to them, they are guilty of consummate folly, for even if they were Masons, and Ma- sonry were of God, why dedicate lodges to them ? Strange if the property of the Almighty must be dedicated in so- lemn form lo somd of his creatures. \" The method of dedicating a masonic hall is, in its na- ture, nothing less than blasphemy ; though Masons may in- tend to perform a religious, and a very solemn ceremony."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"BKV.

Op this occasion the great name of God is taken in vain, trifled with, and blasphemed. 19 Mr. Stearns is a Mason, and well understands of what he affirms. The manner of dedicating masonic halls is correctly described, according to the form given also in the Book of Constitutions, (p. 99.) Here observe one of the sweet catches of our dark Mis- tress, 44 Whose word at any lima will paaa, \" Point blank on both aides of a caae.\" She says: \" In the name of the holy St. Join, I do so- lemnly dedicate this hall to virtue. 99 Very well. The lecture on the first degree, accords with the follow- ing : \" Our ancient brethren dedicated their lodges to Solo- mon, yet Masons professing Christianity dedicate theirs to St John the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist.\" (F. M. L. p. 148.) But the ceremony of dedication says: \" In the name of the holy St John, 99 and not St Johns: which has this masonic advantage, that Jews, Turks, and Infidels, will un- derstand the dedication as made to the Baptist; for him they honour; while Christians will understand the Beloved disciple. Thus all parties are pleased, and the harmony of the lodge is preserved; whereas, if the dedication were to the holy St Johns, the infidels might fly, and discord break the bonds of affection among the brethren.

STEARNS 1 INQUIRY, Mr* Town's Speculative Free Masonry, which will be ap- proved by the reader. \" It has been said by some of the fraternity, that Mr. Town's book is incorrect, and of little consequence; that it does not contain the sentiments of Masons, only those of the author. This is an impeachment of the grand body of Masons in the State of New-York, some of whom are of high standing in various departments of life. The book professes, on its title-page, to be, 'A System of Speculative Free Masonry;' 'exhibited in a course of lectures before the Grand Chapter of the State of New-York, at their an- nual meetings in the city of Albany.' ' It was reduced to a regular system by their special request;' and recommend- ed by them to the public, as 'A System of Free Masonry.' It is further recommended by no less than nine grand offi- cers, in whose presence the lectures were delivered, by an* other who had examined them, and by the honourable De Witt Clinton, General Grand High Priest, &c. At the time of its publication, it was patronized by individuals of near- ly 150 different lodges and chapters through the States, and more than four thousand copies were subscribed for. All this may be seen by examining the book.\" Free Masonry is capable both of solemnly recommending, and solemnly denouncing Mr. Town's Speculative Masonry, having regard not to the book itself, but solely to her own locality and convenience; as in Britain or Turkey, among Christians or Hindoos: \" Her oaths not being bound to bear, \" That literal now the words infer, \" But, bj her well established usage, \" Are to be Judged how far th' engage; \" And where the sense by custom's checked, * Are found void, and of none effect.\""},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"FME MASONRT—BJCiaM. 227 CHAPTER XXXVII. u Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far ** Let evening blush to own a star: **No; when I blush, be this my shame* u That I no more revere his name. 1 ' Gregg.

Tins weighty charge is considerately made, as will appear from the ac- companying documents. It is the common boast of the books, and treatises, and orators of Free Masonry, that in a lodge, all the members, of whatever country or religion, character or sect, meet on the level, and part on the square; that the Arab and Turk, Chinese and American, Hindoo and European, harmoniously join in the work and services *>f the lodge, with mutual plea- sure and edification. Now, if any man name the Lord Jesus, except lightly, in such an assembly, he must offend the Musselmen to say something reverential of Mahomet, &c, and the harmony of the lodge would be sacrificed. If Vishnu were praised, the Christians present might take alarm at the proselyting spirit of their Hindoo brethren, and withdraw from the dis- cordant lodge. No peculiar views of religion are taught, but only grand, moral principles; duty to heaven, to self, and to neighbours; leaving the Chinese to worship then- emperor, the Hindoos, their three millions, &c. &c.

How can that be managed with harmony among so discordant believers, so heterodox worshippers ? Simply by reducing every form of expression to pure Deism: by worshipping under the name of the Deity, the unknown God of the Greeks, or any other which may be in the heart of the supplicant Christians, Mahometans, and Jews, unite in one name, and agree in the lodges to call on that name ; but that is more in the spirit of personal accommodation, than in obedience to the true principles of Free Masonry; for should a Brahmin or Chinese be present, he would at once complain of the exclusive spirit, the proselyting spirit of his masonic brethren, while they addressed prayers to the God of the Patriarchs and Prophets: and that will never do; the harmony of the lodge is no more, under such circum- stances, to boast of, than the union of Christians; and to ac- commodate the Chinese, who arc a great people, we must call on u the Deity,\" and then they can believe Fo is meant, or the emperor. Though three great classes of men do agree in the lodges to worship a particular name, eontrary to the true spirit of Free Masonry, and at the risk of offending their half civi- lized and savage brethren; yet, they must, for the sake of harmony, sink all differences amqng themselves; neither the Saviour of the world, nor the false prophet, may be named, without offence to the Jew, and to either Turk or Christian. To offer a petition in his name who is our Ad- vocate with the Father, to call on his name to whom Ste- phen committed his departing spirit, and besides vyhom, crucified, Paul would know nothing, serving to bonds and death; this would interrupt the harmony of the masonic system, the concord of the Turk, Jew, and Christian, and, therefore, must be dispensed with; and, sorry to say, it is dispensed with; the name of die Lord Jesus is banished, as from a system of pure Deism.

Christian worshippers, that is, men using the forms of Christianity in their usual services, and bred up to no other, except as they were taught in the lodges, did not leave out this glorious name in our worship by an oversight No, no; much as I would rejoice to light upon the slightest palliation of this treason against their Lord, in our grand chaplains, I must believe the omission is not accidental, is not made by a momentary forgetfiilness of the pro- mise, \" Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you,\" (John, xvi. 23.) but in obedience to the stern laws of Free Masonry, which level all dis- tinctions of religion as well as rank, and hail the Arab, the Mohawk, and the Tartar, as brethren of the same de- votional family with the Christian and the Jew. The wor- ship compiled in the Books of Constitutions of Free Ma- sonry, is modelled on the principles of Free Masonry, and not on the doctrines of the cross: it is made subservient to the laws of a mystical society, and contrary to the precepts of the gospel; it is published for the honour of the mystery, and is a reproach upon Him who came down from Heaven, and now has the government there. Reader, let not a doubt check the rising of your indig- nation against this deep scheme of infidelity; against this new mode of attack upon the religion in which we have been bred. Under the influence of Christianity, our coun- try has risen from a feeble band to be a mighty nation; and the district school and the Christian temple, rise on every hand, where our fathers have seen the hut of the savage and the beast of prey. No lover of his country, no dema- gogue of a party, can wish to see the religion of his country and of his fathers trampled upon and despised, however secretly it may be done, whether in a lodge-room, or in the vault of the royal arch, or in the masonic tabernacle.

Indeed, it is despised by Free Masonry: deny it none can: men may shut their eyes upon the meridian sun, but the light of the universe shines still. They may refuse to see that the worship which strikes out the name of the Lord Jesus from its ritual, is hostile to the name of Jesus: but that is Free Masonry; and is hostile to the name of Jesus.

So does Free Masonry to the Christian, when she says, \" the Word in the first verse of St. John, in all its relatoins to man, time, and eternity, constitutes the very spirit and essence of Specu- lative Free Masonry ;\" ( Town, p. 155.) while, at the instant, she banishes the name of the Lord Jesus from her ritual, teaching to approach the throne of grace in another way.* I do not say, that all masters of lodges feel bound so * 1 make no exception in farour of the Knights Templars and others; for if Free Masonry hare a fair claim to these, I have a separate account open with her there."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"232   FREE MASONRY. close by their pledge of obedience to the general regula- tions of the grand lodge, as never to use any other form of prayer than is prescribed in their Books of Constitutions. I have heard the name by which we of this favoured land are called, pronounced in the reverential tone of worship in a lodge of Master Masons. But that master carried his religion where he had better not have gone himself, and obeyed his Lord, rather than the Book of Constitutions, So, in every case, those who, in a masonic lodge, call upon the name of Jesus, or lift up their voice through the only Mediator between God and man, depart from the true ma- sonic character, and from the wwd masonic manner; the expression sounds unnatural there. It is not admissible in lodge meeting, or in a Mason any where, to do, or say, what will offend an Arab, or brother Turk. \" As Masons, we only pursue that universal religion which unites the most different principles in one sacred band, and brings together those who were most distant from one another/ 1 (Book of Const. 133.) That is pure Deism. \" It is now thought most expedient, that the brethren in general should only be charged to adhere to the essentials of religion in which all men agree. 91 (Book of Cons. p. 34.) That is pure Deism, and is taught in the Book of Constitutions of Free Masonry. ( Vide F. M. L. p. 66.)

Free Masonry has no inherent good to create factions. When it is made the servant of a Dektical party, as it was by Voltaire and his crew, before the French Revolution; or of political factions, as it is at this time in Mexico; or of vanity and pompous show, as is common in our own coun- try, Free Masonry derived some consequence from the use made of it: but that it has no natural stamina upon which men may divide; no inherent virtue or benefit for which it is possible to excite a passionate desire, is manifest from the cheapness of her favours, and from the readiness with which she accommodates herself to all classes and condi- tions of men^ pagans or savages. None quarrel for the dirt which is trodden under foot by every passenger; it is the silver and the gold, the precious treasures, which excite men to disgraceful bickerings. Frail man will yet rudely contend for an unequal portion of eve-* ry earthly good; and no strife of this kind being found with- in the lodges, is a clear demonstration of the fact, that Free Masonry is a senseless thing, incapable of exciting the natural passions of the soul. But the history of Free Masonry shows that the use of tian to excuse their indocility; (Voltaire) but justice obliges us to acknow- ledge, that this is the only sect of all others, (Deists,) that has not disturbed society by its disputes; and which, though erroneous, has always been dear of fanaticism.

IT is not a little difficult, satisfactorily to prove any thing in relation to a topic which is sometimes operative, some- times s peculative, a mechanic art, or. a liberal science; which is sometimes the very essence of Christianity, and sometimes the way of winning the faculty of magic ; a re- ligion in whieh all men agree, and the art of foresaying things to come; which, in fine, bows the knee sometimes in solemn invocation to the Deity, and teaches its pupils to become good and perfect without the help of fear or hope. Such a farrago of absurdities is ancient Free Masonry; and yet, if it have any distinguishing and uniform charac- teristic, this is it, viz. it acknowledges a God without the re- ception of divine revelation. The quotations already made from standard treatises on Masonry, establish this trait in her character. But such is the importance of the subject, when viewed in connexion with the two thousand lodges of our country, and with the glorious and fearful truths of the gospel rejected by Free Masonry, that I shall not fear to tire the reader's patience by summoning before him further witnesses. .

Free Masonry inculcates pure Deism; if her disciples refuse to learn, that is not altogether her fault; she is entitled to the credit of a diligent and faithful in- structress. This will more fully appear by what follows. \" Let a man's religipn, or mode of it, be what it will, we do not exclude hiih from our order, provided he believes in the glorious Architect of heaven and earth, and practises the sacred duties of morality.\"— (F. M. Library, p. 160.) This is part of the charge given to an entered appren- tice. This is a part of the first lessof of Free Masonry. \" You worship the universal Lord of nature in the way you think most pleasing to him; you practise every duty of mo- rality, and he does not reject you; and shall we? no; come to us, and find your friends, your brethren.\"(— Idem.) Whether it \" please\" the apprentice to worship the uni- versal Lord as the God Saturn, the God Moloch, the God Vishnu, the God Fo, the God Jupiter, or the God Reason with the IUuminfes, is all one to Free Masonry; she is a professed teacher of religion, and only requires him \" to adhere to the essentials in which all men agree\" — (Book of Cons. p. 34. Idem, F. M. Library, p. 66.) But he must not have a humped back, or a maimed limb, or an illegiti- mate parentage. \" The apprentice must be free front, and of limbs whole, as a man ought to be, and no bastard.\" (F. M. Library, p. 14. Idem, Preston. London, 1788. p. 103. The same in other authors, under the title, Ancient Charges.) He must be \"free 6orn, of a good kindred, and have his right limbs, as a man ought to have\" (F. M. L. p. 14.) She is very particular. Now, that the lodges sometimes admit dismembered pupils, and even Atheists, I readily grant; but that only proves, that the lodges depart froth their instructions. Free Masonry teaches and charges her apprentice: Adore the Being ofaU beings, of whom thy heart is full; (Free Mas.

She does certainly inculcate upon him the religion in which all men agree ; and can as readily ex- cuse his errors, as those of her pupils, who fall into the uncha- ritable faith in divine revelation: \" Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\" (John, iii. 3.) Free Masonry regards all her children with impartial fondness; she weeps over their errors, and does her utmost to reclaim them, whether they deviate to the right hand or left, and aims alike! to tame the spirit of the fulminating priest, and to engage the esteem of the moral brother.* Not destitute of the wisdom which is from beneath, she chooses her measures with deep cunning. Having learned that the most stupid, when he regards the heavens, must acknowledge that there is a God ;t she, too, is very forward to acknowledge it. But millions, blindly worshipping him in the stock of a tree, or a block of stone, carved with men's hands, she is blind with them, and worships him so too: millions, sharper sighted, see and worship him in the river that fertilises their fields, and in the corn that renews their strength; she sees and worships too, bowing most humbly to the drag and the net, for by these we the.

Many writers in the English language have been quoted, to show that Free Masonry inculcates pure Deism; (what- ever her pupils may learn;) and the grand chapter have freely told us, how Masonry arid Christianity are one; and this, too, in the face of truth, and the day. Now we will hear what\" Esprit du dogme de la Franche Maconrie\" has to say upon the subject. The work is not sanctioned by any grand chapter or grand officers. Whether that fashion is unknown upon the Contihent of Europe, or whether the book is too barefaced to require letters of credit, does not appear. The reader cannot suppose, after what has been presented in this volume, that Free Masonry would hesi- tate to sanction any thing, for absurdity or impiety. \" Esprit du Dogme^ was published at Brussels, in the Netherlands, A.

Free Masonry is defining herself in a way not to be, mistaken; and if any, looking «t the number of her lodges, fear for the moral health of our country, it is well to be on the alert, using gentle Re- medies, and, by no means, harsh or violent medicine?, which inevitably weaken the body,.

This is her obscure cunning, to make the profane ad- mire her mystery, to give Revelation a stab in its glorified Author, and then, next to plead the illimitable extent of masonic charity, not as if for the wound just given, but seemingly for treating of various mysteries 1 This is Free Masonry, both in doctrine and in example. She pleads her law of charity in a most edifying manner: \" Do I couple the doctrines of Egypt and Judea? it is not to give an opinion upon them,\" she says. \" Do I present Zoroaster and the Lord in the same point of view ? Every brother knows it is his duty to take dans son sem, to his bo- som the honest man, of whatever religion he may be.\" This is liberality not to to be questioned. This is chari- ty sufficient to pacify the most impious. The Arch Enemy can ask no more: to revile the Lord Jesus, sincerely and ho- nestly, in conformity to the tempters religion. To put the mys- teries of the Persian Zoroaster and of the Holy Gospel upon the same level, for the edification of Free Masons; and in the same breath remind the pupil, that in modes of faith and forms of worship, honest men may be allowed to differ without stint of love or charity. The Father of Lies is a deceiver still, whether he come in the form of an angel of light, or of the daughter of night; he is the tempter still, whether he come in the form of a serpent, or of Free Masonry.

This is too much,, too much for silly Masonry. She is but a puppet made to play antic tricks, while a master spirit moves the wires, and filches the pockets of the gaping crowd. The whole object of the divine economy, as re- vealed in the holy scriptures, is to make men \" good and perfect; 19 and the method taken by heaven's Truth, is, to invite by hopes of joy unspeakable, and to persuade by the fear of terrors inconceivable. ' The Enemy's method, or Free Masonry's, if you please, is exactly the reverse of this. He began his instructions neat* the time of the masonic era* teaching Eve, without the help of fear , to eat, and be like God, knowing good and evil. And man being ruined, the enemy has only to keep him perfect without the help of hope, or fear , and his work is done. Thus we arrive at the spirit of the doctrines of Free Masonry, by collecting them from the standard treatises x)f the fraternity, and showing their relation to the Father of Lies, and to eternal night and death. I know the relation- ship will disgust many, and will offend soiqe; offend them with the discoverer nearly as much as with the connexion discovered; But if masonic charity will justify an at- tack both secret and open upon revealed religion, seeing it is made honestly, and in conformity to the assassin's mode of worshipping the Dew, she will undoubtedly be able to re- ceive kindly a rap upon her own head, seeing it is honestly laid on, and, also, in conformity to the assailant's mode of worship."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"246 ANCIENT FREE HA80NRT 18 DK18V.

They are little aware of it, and I cannot but hope to deserve their hearty thanks for presenting Free Masonry to them, as they once wer» presented to her, neither barefoot nor shod, with a cable tow about the neck ; her's was a night scene, when she laughed in her heart, to see sober men groping after the light which her own bandage had shut from thdir eyes; ours is an atfair of the day. The Deistical character of the institution is abundantly proved, without meaning, now or at any time, that the fra- ternity assume that character. In pursuing the subject, I propose only to show the easy way Free Masonry has of putting a most important construction upon rites senseless and unmeaning in themselves. She says, in Esprit du Dogme, p. 115., \" We have many rites and degrees which recall to mind our divine Master, Jesus, the supper, the pas- sion, and his resurrection;\" but these must be rites belong- ing to higher degrees than the master's, and I would only observe, in relation to trjem,that they more clearly discover the anti-religious ppirit of Free Masonry; she does not cel- ebrate the Lord, or his sufferings, with an honest purpose, however honest her followers are: not she."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"AKCIBNT raSfi MASONRY IS DKISM, 347 But the following a Master Mason can understand. \" In these days, the allegory of Hiram, which is used in every ritual of Masonry, varies in our mysteries and ceremonies, and it is applied under such circumstances, and used in the same manner, as the ancient feierophants represented, sometimes, Otitis, at others Bacchus, Amman, or Ids ; and every other form of the Deity whom they variously worship- ped. So we, in the same manner, change in our temples the legend of Hiram* and of his three assassin*, according to the ritual to which they belong.

It requires no stretch of fancy to find the bearing of this masonic lesson. The legend of Hiram, with its usual ex- planation, is no more \"interesting than a bare hook thrown into the water; but if it will catch the hopes of immortal souls, it assumes quite a new aspect That doctrine which has ever been a stumbling block to the self-righteous, and an offence to the conceitedly wise, may well be supposed to awaken the contempt of Free Masonry. No doubt she regards the sacrifice of the cross with a feeling of inexpressible ridicule; the meekness of the Lamb that was slain, is in her estimate no better than the pusillanimity of Hiram Abiff: that is natural to the pha- risee. It is not passing belief that she should mock at the blood which was shed for the remission of sins; that she should celebrate the agony of the Passion without sorrow, and the sacrament of the supper without love; that she should present the grand master, Hiram Abiff, basely dying for the masonic word, as a leer upon him who died upon the cross to save sinners. I do not say she does this; it has been far from me to suspect her of this; indeed a hint of it from any profane, would have sounded like the echo of distant scandal, or appeared like the insinuations of jealousy. But when her followers come before the public in a handsome volume, with indisputable evidence that they are initiated into her mysteries, and declare that Free Masonry does this, it would be blindness not to examine the matter; to inquire, at least, whether Free Masonry is capable of doing this?

Masonry, yet we will strive to conduct it without prejudice or partiality. Let justice decide. He} favourite biographers in the English tongue, may be divided into two classes; those who make her spring up with time, or come from -the Almighty hand at the beginning; and those who trace her origin in the odious mysteries of the ancient heathen. Anderson, Preston, and Webb, are leaders of,the former class; and Lawrie, Greenleaf, and Cole, are of the latter. Hutchinson ought to be passed by,, for he clearly supports both. Let us see if her origin forbid the imputation upon her character made by Esprit. Heaven is a place of truth; and the established reputation of Free Masonry for false- hood, compels us to believe that, if she came from heaven to earth, it was because she was driven out, or had lost all power to deceive there; and, therefore, she would be capa- ble of the profanity attributed to her by Esprit. If she sprung up in the beginning, not coming from tteaven; then she would be capable of the blasphemy which,her pupil, Esprit, has laid at her door. And her origin, as given ei- ther way by the former class, will not deliver her from a righteous condemnation. If she came, with Lawrie and others, from the Eleusi- nia, the Bacchanalia, and the- degrading rites of heathen Rome and Greece, Britain and Gaul, then she may^well be thought capable of the deeds credited to her by her own son, Esprit du Dogme. And she cannot be rescued, by the purity of her origin, from the reproach of mocking the King of Kings, in the interpretation of the legend of Hiram* We will see if her well established character forbids our be- lief of the charge; the known maxims of her life, and rule of her conduct. Her system of morality is founded upon temporal expe- diency ; which is no better foundation than that of the royal arch. Her own example is proof.

In Turkey, she kneels seven times a day, in obedience to the false-prophet; and in revolution- ary France, kicks up her heels without decency, but with every demonstration of joy, to the cry of \"Free! Free! Free! Free from every restraint of religion, and of law; free to follow after reason.\" This is matter of history; the records of the times show it beyond dispute. Her faith- ful pupil, Esprit , declares it; and, perhaps, the Mason still refuses to believe this is the Daughter of night; as if one m the intoxication of her cups, could not be the same one who laboured patiently to Jill them. Her system of morality has no dependence upon the law of the Eternal, and any independent system is, like Free Masonry, rottenness to the bones. To establish a rule of conforming religious principles according to circumstances ; charging men, as Masonry says she formerly did,* to wor- ship in the mode of the people among whom they reside) is a scheme, worthy of the darkest complexion of Free Ma- sonry, and is proof enough, that if it were her interest to scoff at the sacrifice of the cross, she is capable of the blasphemy attributed to her by Esprit. It only remains to examine the point of interest. All who are guided in their views of interest by bare expe- diency, are in great danger of mistaking their interest; but views of expediency, founded on the law of God, and hav- ing reference to the day which is after death, are well founded; no doubt, to the short sighted, they may some- times appear mistaken views, but all must acknowledge they have good foundation; they alone have good founda- tion. But Free Masonry, it has been shown, governs herself by a view to bare expediency, independent of the immutable law of God; bowing here, cringing there, and again, throwing her cap with the madness of a demon, to suit local circumstances; having no respect to consistency of * Book of Constitutions of Massachusetts, p. 34."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"ANCIENT FREE MASONRY IS DEISM. 251 character, and to the value of plain truth, but solely to her own advantage; (in the words of her Books of Constitu- tions,) \" to her own profit and praise.\" Sueh a moralist, who had contributed' an incalculable amount of labour to produce the scenes of the reign of terror^ when the Scriptures of heavenly truth, and of glo- rious promise, were indignantly rejected before the multi- tude, denounced by the national convention, and burned in the public place by the common executioner, while reason mounted tfye throne of moral government, and received the homage of laws abolishing the Sabbath day, and the religious rite of marriage, might be pardoned for thinking, in the fulness of her joy, that interest required her to exhi- bit more completely, the features of a faqe, which, darkly seen, drew multitudes of admirers. It is the interest of vice, when her pupil has become familiar with one shade of her character, to exhibit a darker.* Free Masonry is a perfect illustration, of this truth, while .the fact is a per- fect illustration of the character of Free Masonry. And it was for her interest, in the progress of vice, to scoff at the name she had always despised.

We have seen, in the notice of the royal arch emblems, that our lady makes bold with the tabernacle, and its con- secrated utensils, with the burning bush, the heavenly manna, the tables jof the covenant, &c.; that she sets them out in dumb show as a part of her paraphernalia.

Now, whence should we expect aid in support of our assertion, sooner than from the Christian Mason ? Who would more readily contribute to preserve the hallowed vessels of the church, than brethren of the church ? Ah! they did not believe it When it was told to them, and perhaps their very reverence for these things has been, no doubt it has been, one of the chief folds of the bandage to blind them. . I do not now presume to know the use our brethren make of the emblems of the royal arch degre^; but surely they do not mean to use them sacrilegiously; they do not use them as we shall see Free Masonry uses them. They are Christians; -she is a heathen, or what you please; and yet we would call her by some amiable name here, for the kindness of discovering to us the use to which she can put the holy things of the ancient church. As a porch to the masonic tabernacle, she ever has much to say about the Free Mason who built it. You shall find it so in the Chart, Monitors> Library, &c. It was Moses upon Mount Sinai, that received the masonic word from the mouth of the Most High, and handed it down to poste- rity ; and various passages of the Pentateuch are read in the ceremonies of the royal arch chapters, calculated and intended to impress the reader or hearer with the belief, that they have some indefinite relation to the mysteries of Free Masonry. I frankly confess that, some time having been confident they had no honest connexion with the modern invention, I have not suffered a suspicion to arise of their nefarious connexion. They have seemed to Stand among the rega- lia and insignia of the lodge, rather to ennoble base Ma- sonry, than for any malicious purpose of degrading them; and probably that is yet the right interpretation of these emblems in the chapters of North America; but our lady is a mistress, knows how to train up children, has a large school of dull scholars, we may charitably hope; and though Americans may not learn so fast in this degenerating cli-"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"254 ANCIENT FEEE MASONRY IS DEISM. t mate,* as the more favoured inhabitants of central and southern Europe, the very least progress in the science which follows, is greatly to be deprecated. \" It is said that Moses wrote different books of the Bible : Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. Thtse books have a great resemblance to the lessons of the Egyptian priests:—nevertheless, it appears, that besides the' Egyp- tian books, Moses had the Phenician history of the crea- tion, by Sanchoniathon, who lived before Moses, 937 years,\" ad annum. (Esprit du Dogme, p. 27.) This is another specimen of Masonic tradition. She knows Sanchoniathon 1 ^ history, and where Moses found the materials for the PENTAteuch: ay, she knows rjiuch more than her diffidence permits her to discover: yet she would seem not to know, that Moses wrote Deuterono- my; and that, my reader, was no oversight iri her,—enu- merating four books, to leave the fifth: no; she under- stands very well that Penta means five, and that she has enumerated but four ; and she did it of mere wantonness, to insinuate a falsehood, preparatory to the positive un- truth following it; that Moses gathered his writings from Egyptian priests. Our American Free Masonry is not by many degrees so far advanced as this; but perseverance will accomplish wonders. \" Moses, having learned the institutes of the Egyptian priests, gave to the Jews, for the foundation of their reli- gion and creed, the worship of the one only God, of the great Jehovah.\" (Idem. p. 30.) - Now Free Masonry cares not for the name she affects to be fearful of sacrilege in pronouncing. She does pro- nounce it, with falsehood on her lips. She has ever denied divine revelation, by setting at nought the name of Jesus; and here she is emboldened, aiming at Atheism. She adores the God of the holy scriptures, and still denies those scriptures; she is a fast friend of the Unity, and still puts * VideBuffon."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"ANCIENT FREE MASONRY IS DEISM.  255 contempt upon the doctrine, drawing it from the polluted idolators of Egypt; she magnifies Jehovah, and yet reviles his servant Moses, and the Prophets, and the only begotten Son of God. These are fearful things, being true. All the evidence of their truth it is not possible to lay before the reader, as it lies before me; but enough is here, perhaps too much, and it goes to prove what has been little suspected; viz. that the grand secret of Free Masonry is Atheism. Now we will have her explanation of the tabernacle with its contents, as used in her workshop; by no means the maxi- mum of her impiety, and chiefly interesting to show what she can have to do with the golden candlestick, and Aaron's rod that budded. Esprit du Dogme, i. e. Spirit of the Doctrine, de la Frtmche Map.: of Free Masonry, p. 39, says: \"Moses, in his mysteries, and Solomon after him, adopted a great part of the Egyptian emblems, which from them we have pre- served in our mysteries. Let us see what they teach us. , \" The brazen sea, among the Egyptians, was used for the purification of candidates with water; it was an emblem of the year, supported by twelve bullocks, which represent- ed the twelve months, of which three looked east, three south, three west, and three north; making allusion to the four seasons. 41 Moses adopted this emblem; and in Exodus, 38. 8. we see that the women of the tribe of Levi, who passed the night watching at the door of the tabernacle, presented to Moses their mirrors, which were of brass or silver, to make the brazen sea. Hence the lodges of Adoption.\" It is instructive to see how certainly the doctrines of de- vils lead to infernal practices.

And our modest author would charge the Jewish women with that which few of his readers could have a Bible at their side to contradict; appealing to Exodus xxxviii. 8. for the origin of Jodges of Adoption. The verse reads, \" And he made the laverof brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the looking glasses {brazen mirrors] of the women assem- bling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation/ 1 \" THE CANDLESTICK \" Hath seven branches and seven lights, .symbols of the seven sciences, to which the priests ought to apply them- selves, like the priests of Memphis and of Thebes, to wit: grammar, rhetoric, logic,, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.\" We must infer from this, that the studies of the fellow craft's degree are reviewed in the chapters; which is a match for the allegory of a scene which never occur- red, as faithfully represented by Free Masonry, in the tra- dition of Hiram Abiff. \" THE TAB&E OF SHEW BREAD \" Was intended to show the necessity of union among the priests: this allegory instructs us, as it did the Levites.\" But concluding the command to Moses how to construct the table, (Ex. xxv* 30.) the Lord said, \" And thou shah set upon the table shew bread before me alway\" Reason is certain that it is not her part, faithlessly to inquire why it pleased the Lord to have a table of shew bread in the cere- monial of his ancient church; but only to inquire into the fact: did it please ? And rinding God's own word in sup- port of the fact, while only her own blindness is counter to it, she is reason no longer, but a fool, to doubt it, to despise it, to degrade it among plumb-lines and trowels, in the mystical ceremonies of a nocturnal society."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"\" SPIRIT OF THE DOCTRINE OF FREE MASONRY.\" 357 \" THE ALTAR OF INCENSE* \" Showed the Hebrews, as it-docs us, that our vows ought always to be addressed to the 8/.

WE have been furnished by the grand chapter with a specimen of Free Masonry's reasoning in support of a doc- trine possessing some part of the mighty influence it ought to possess over those who cordially receive it, viz. the mode of divine existence expressed by the term Trinity; the reader may find instruction in observing how she can also attack that doctrine, and in assisting, punish her folly. She is giving a store of traditional knowledge, alias true as Free Masonry, with respect to the foreign trade of the Jews in India and Persia, Greece and Arabia, where they carried their mysteries and their dogmas, receiving in turn many opinions before unknown in Judea, \" whence sprung\" she says, \" the sects of the Sadducees, the Herodians, the learned Pharisees, and the virtuous Essenes\" \" Under these circumstances, the worship of the great Jehovah, with its mysteries and allegories, was nigh being destroyed, and even forgotten, by the introduction of new systems, and in particular by that of the Trinitarians, which was introduced from Persia. In that country the sages adopt the belief of one God, with two elements, light and darkness.\" \" To strengthen these false principles brought by the Jews from Persia, there came from Greece the allegories and reveries of Plato, by the aid of which that philosopher 34"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"966 U SPIRIT OP THE DOC TRIM;; OF FUSE MAM)NRY.

Maconneri<>, pp. 85,86.) She exhibits several pages of her traditionary lore upon this subject, without making the slightest inference from any part: \" Critics assure us,\" she says, \" that Jesus never spoke of the doctrine of the Trinity.\" She would seem to hide her own modest opinion, and, with a bewitching timidity, considering the stores of her learning, she only repeats what the critics say. It is to her usual credit, that the name she banishes from her devotions, is here quoted under the authority of the critics, for her own purposes, to vilify the holy name unto which we are baptized, and sa- credly dedicated. Whether supporting the doctrine by the aid of the grand chapter, and the argument of the three pillars, and of the three lights of a lodge, or opposing it by the pretence of its Persian original, with some Grecian refinement, her ob- ject is always the same*—to heap up contempt against the Majesty of heaven; and although the difference in the mo- tives of her instruments is immense, it is difficult to tell which serves her best, the profound argument of the pil- lars, or the affectedly modest insinuations of Esprit. These are considerations of awftd import, not suggested by enemies of Masonry, but by her pupils and friends. Messrs.

It is worthy of the reader's notice, that Hutchiifson, with the sanction of the Grand Lodge of England, Smith, Lawrie, the learned historian of Free Masonry, and many others, represent Egypt and her priests as largely connot- ed with Masonry and Esprit, giving the masonic tradition of wh&t the Egyptian priests did, and did not believe, is within the record, ho brother can call him to order. (P. 75.) Esprit informs us that the legend of Hiram and his assassins is a Jewish substitute for the Egyptian repre- sentation of the murder of Osiris; and again, (p. 77.) that the legend of Hiram is an allegory of the Saviour; so that the representation of the death of Hiram is a middle link, connecting the death of the Cross to the death of Osiris. Now we see the use of knowing what the Coptic priests be- lieved with respect to the death of Osiris; and how artfuOy our lady insinuates a falsehood, that openly asserted would fail of all impression, from the notorious character of the as- sertef. \" The Egyptian priests never believed in the reality of the assassination of Osiris;\" and the legend of Hiram be- ing an allegory of the death of the cross, and, previously, the allegory of the death of Osiris, which is the allegory of a falsehood, the death of the cross becomes no better to Free Masonry, than the aneieht Masons' WORD, \" which, 1 ' says the Sovereign Inspector General, \" is not a word, but a itaere jumble of sounds without meaning.\" \" Neither did the Egyptian priests believe, that a calf or nil onion could be god*;\" she will pawn her word for it— When they bowed down before them in worship, invoking"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"268 u SPIRIT Or THK DOCTEIIfE OF FREE MASOHKY.\" their mercy and aid, and offering costly sacrifices, it is plain they did believe in the divinity of the calf and of the onion, or in some Free Masonry, \" They never believed in the reality of devils and of an- gels.\" Next to the denial of the God of revelation, it is important to the devil to persuade men of his own non-ei* tity: no devil, no hell, no wicked.

Free Masonry is a secret: does he know that secret ? Men climb to a giddy height, and yet the thing is beyond them.—Suppose it is not American, yet it is Free Masonry; and the day our lodges are sufficiently trained, to receive the odious impiety which has gone over France like a flood, that day will make this infidelity -, American Free Masonry. It is right to know what fruit she has produced in other countries, whether of doctrine or example, that we may form some reasonable expectation of the harvest to be reaped from her unprece- dented expansion (I will not say growth) in this country. And what is the harvest we are to expect from her in- structions in the two thousand lodges of this country, being once made acquainted with her falsehood, her doctrine of temporal expediency, her acknowledged Deism, her per- fecting men without the aid of fear or hope?

I was acquainted with many, and some were my intimate friends. These, with all that zeal common to young adepts, frequently pressed me to become one of their brotherhood. As I constantly refused, they undertook to enrol me, notwithstanding my refusal. The plan settled, I was invited to dinner at a friend's house, and was the only profane in the midst of a large party of Masons. Dinner over, and the servants or- dered to withdraw, it was proposed to form themselves into a lodge, and to initiate me. 1 persisted in my refusal, and particularly refused to take the oath of keeping a secret, the very object of which was unknown to me. They dis- pensed with the oath, but I still refused. They became more pressing, telling me that Masonry was perfectly inno- cent, and that its morality was unobjectionable; in reply, I asked whether it was better than the Gospel. They only answered by forming themselves into a lodge, when began all those grimaces and childish ceremonies which are de- scribed in books of Masonry, such as Jachin and Boaz.* I attempted to make my escape; but in vain; the apart- ment was very extensive, the house in a retired situation; the servants in the secret, and all the doors locked.!

At length the* venerable, with the utmost gra- vity, put the following question: * Brother, are you disposed to execute all the orders of the grand master, though you were to receive contrary orders from a king, an emperor, or any other sovereign whatever? 1 My answer was, * iVb.' —' What, no,' replies the venerable with surprise! \" Are you only entered among us to betray our secrets! Would you hesitate between the interests of Masonry, and those of the profane?

I certainly believed the whole to be a farce; but even in joke I would not promise obedience to their grand master, especially on the supposition that his commands could ever be contrary to those of the sovereign.

Every one kept the most pro- found silence, except the venerable, though they were much amused with the scene. \" It at length grew more serious between the venerable and me. He would not give up the point; and, renewing his question over and over again, he was in hopes, by tiring my patience, to extort a YES. At length I found myself quite wearied out. I was blindfolded. I tore off the ban- dage, threw it upon the ground, and stamping my foot, called out No, with every sign of impatience.

In the mean while he gave, me the signs and the pass-words for the third degree, as he had done for the other two.* This was sufficient to enable me to be admitted into a re- gular lodge, and now we were all brethren.

The English good sense has banished such an explanation. I have even heard of a resolution taken by some of the chief craftsmen, of rejecting all those who might seek to intro- duce the revolutionary liberty among them. I have read most excellent discourses and lectures on the avoiding of abuses in the history of Masonry. I have there seen the grand master telling the brethren, that the true equality of the craft does not authorize the brother, when out of the lodge, to derogate from that respect and deference due to the rank which any person bears in the world, or their dif- ferent political degrees and titles.

Most certainly the Free Masons tio hot make a se- cret of what is praiseworthy in their association. It is not that fraternal affection for their neighbour which they hide, and which they only have in common with every religious observer of the gospel. Neither do they make a secret of the sweets of that convivial equality which accompanies their meetings, and their fraternal repasts. On the contra- ry, they are perpetually extolling their benevolence, and nobody is ignorant of the conviviality of their entertain- ments. Their secret must, therefore, contain something widely different from this fraternity, and something less in- nocent than the mirth of the masonic table. \" Such language, in general, might have been held to all masons; such reasonings might have made them suspect that the higher degrees of their association contained mysteries, which it was far more interested in hiding, than their fra- ternity, their signs, and pass-words. \" That affected secrecy on the first principles of Masonry, liberty and equality, the oath never to reveal that such was the basis of the doctrines, premised that there existed such an explanation of these words, as the sect was interested in hiding, both from the state and church.

They were three thousand workmen. That each one might re- ceive his due, Adoniram divided them into three classes, apprentices, fellow-crafts, and masters. He intrusted each class with a word, signs, and a grip, by which they might be recognised. Each class was to preserve the greatest se- crecy as to these signs and words. Three of the fellow- crafts, wishing to know the word, and by that means obtain the salary of master, hid themselves in the tem- ple, and each posted himself at a different gate. At the usual time, when Adoniram came to shut the gates of the temple, the first of the three met him, and demanded the word of the masters: Adoniram refused to give it, and re- ceived a violent blow with a stick on his head. He flies to another gate, is met, challenged, and treated in a similar manner by the second : flying to the third door, he is killed by the fellow-craft posted there, on his refusing to betray the word.

He receives a sort of benediction in the name of the immortal and invisible Jehovah, and in future it is under that title that he is to adore the Deity, because the significa- tion of JEHOVAH is far more expressive than that of ADONAI. 44 In this first degree he receives the masonic science only as descending from Solomon and Hiram, and revived by the Knights Templars.

The gospel, in declaring the unity of God, teaches us the trinity of persons; but this mystery, like all others which we learn from revelation, humbles the sophisters in their own minds.

He thereby learns that the day on which the word JEHOVAH was lost, is precisely that on which the son of God, dying on a cross for the salvation of mankind, consummated the grand mystery of our religion, destroying the reign of every other, whether Judaic, natural, or sophistical. The more a Mason is attached to the word, that is, to his pre- tended natural religion, the more inveterate will his hatred be against the author of revealed religion. \" Neither is this word, which he has already found, any longer the object of his researches; his hatred- has further views.

If they had to do with a man who was proof against their impiety, they sought to divert him from the church under pretence of regenerating his faith; they represented to him, that there existed an infinity of abuses in Christianity at present, with respect to the liber- ty and equality of the children of God. With them the word to be recovered was, a wish for a revolution which should revive those times, when every thing was common among Christians; when the distinctions of rich, of poor, or of high and mighty lords, were unknown. They were taught to look forward to the most happy regeneration of mankind, and almost to a new heaven and a new earth. [See TowrCs Speculative Masonry, for the masonic mille- nium, p. 171.] Credulous and simple minds were caught by such magnificent promises. They looked upon the re- volution as that sacred fire which was to purify the earth; and these credulous adepts were seen to second the revo lution with the enthusiastic zeal of a holy cause. This may be called mystical Masonry. Such was the craft of all those fools for whom the occult Masons set up the Prophe- tess La Brousse, so famous in the beginning of the revolu- tion. Such, again, was that of the weak minded Vaylet, the Bishop in partibus of Babylon. I never could con- ceive where he had gathered his religious opinions, when with the greatest simplicity he complained, that I had com- bated them. I was informed of it by a guest of his, whose reputation of great knowledge in Masonry had acquired him a seat at the masonic repasts, which the poor simple man used to give ; and even at those dinners the difference was observable in the adepts, though of the same degree, each having received an explanation of the mysteries coin- ciding with his own disposition. Our simple Bishop viewed"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"OF FREE MASONRY. 305 the whole science of the craft in no other light, than as the perfection of the Gospel; and even in his repasts he was ever mindful of the precepts of the church, keeping abstinence on days appointed, &c. \" The apostate Dom Gerles, on the contrary, was a Ma- son of a quite different system or explanation. He already sung those verses which, in a letter since found among Ro- bespierre's paperg,* he declares to have addressed to truth alone: u Ni Culte, ni Pretres, ni Roi, \"Car la Nouvelle Eve, c'est toi.\"t \" It was at these repasts that the Doctor La Mothe, a learned Rosicrucian, behaved with a modesty which seem- ed to prognosticate that one day he would equally hate both the craft of Varlet and of Dom Gerles. The latter paid his revolutionary debt to the guillotine; the other two are living, and I name them because I am not afraid of being v contradicted, and because these sorts of anecdotes carry strong proof with them, and explain how many persons of the most pious and charitable dispositions have been mis- led ; how a Princess, the sister of the Duke of Orleans, was so blinded as even to pant after the revolution, which in her eyes was to be nothing less than the regeneration of the Christian world. \" Such explanations of the Rosicrucian degree were only for those dupes in whom they remarked a certain bias to- wards mysticity. The generality were abandoned to their own interpretations; but when an adept testified a great desire of acquiring new lights, and was thought able to un« dergothe necessary trials, he was admitted to the degree of Kadosch, or of the regenerated man, where all ambiguity ceases. •Proces Verbal, No. 57. t Neither worship, nor priests, nor king, for thou art the new Ere. 39"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"306  ABBE BARRUEL'S VIEWS \" It was to this degree that the adept of whom we have before spoken, was admitted. Nor was the exhausted state in which he found himself, after having undergone those trials, to be wondered at. Adepts have told me, that no physical art is spared; that there is no machinery, spectres, terrors, <kc. &c. which are not employed, to try the con- stancy of the candidate. We are told by Mr. Montjoye, that the Duke of Orleans was obliged to ascend, and then throw himself off a ladder. If that were all, he was most kindly treated. A deep cave, or rather a precipice, whence a narrow tower rises to the summit of the lodge, having no avenue to it but by Subterraneous passages replete with horror, is the place where the candidate is abandoned to himself, tied hand and foot. In .this situation he finds him- self raised from the ground by machines making the most frightful noise. He slowly ascends this dark vault, some- times for hours together, and then suddenly falls, as if he were not supported by any thing. Thus mounting and falling alternately, he must carefully avoid showing any sign of fear. All this* however, is a very imperfect ac- count of the terrors of which men, who had undergone these trials, speak. They declare that it was impossible for them to give an exact description of them; they lost their senses; they did not know where they were. Draughts were given them, which, adding to their corporal strength, did not restore them to their mental faculties; but rather increased their strength, only to leave them a prey to fury and terror.* \" Many circumstances relating to this degree made us be- lieve, at first sight, that it was connected with Illuminism; but, on examination, we find it to be only a further explana- * The ceremony of admission into the three first degrees, is, in Ame- rica, of a less brutal character than it was some years ago.

Here again the candidate is transformed into an assassin. Here it is no longer the founder of Masonry, Hiram, who is to be avenged, but it is Molay, the Grand Master of the Knights Templars, and the person who is to fall by the assassin's hand is Philippe le Bel, King of France, under whose reign the order of Templars wo* destroyed. \" When the adept sallies forth from the cavern with the reeking head, he cries, Nekom. (I have killed him.) After •this atrocious trial he is admitted to take the oath. I learn- ed from one of the adepts, that at the time when he was about to take the oath, one of the Knights Kadosch held a pistol at his breast, making a sign that he would murder him if he did not pronounce it. On my asking if he believed that he was in earnest, he said that he certainly did believe so, though he could not be sure. At length the veil is rent -asunder. The adept is informed, that till now he had only been partially admitted to the truth; that liberty and equa- lity, which had constituted the first secret on his admission into Masonry, consisted in recognising no superior on earth, and in viewing kings and pontiffs in no other light than as men on a level with their fellow men, having no other rights to sit on the throne, or to serve at the altar, but what the people had granted them, and of which they had the power of depriving them whenever they pleased. They are also informed, that princes and priests have too long abused the goodness and simplicity of the people; that the grand ob- ject of Masonry in building temples to liberty and equality, is, to rid the earth of this double pest, by destroying every altar which credulity and superstition had erected, and every throne on which were only to be seen despots tyrannizing over slaves. \" These documents concerning the degree of Kadosch, are not merely taken from the works of Montjoye and Le Franc, but from the adepts themselves.

After that it occupies the attention of its novices with puerile games of fraternity, or masonic re- pasts ; but it already trains its adepts to the profoundest se- crecy by the most frightful oaths. 44 In that of mas er, it relates to the allegorical history of Adoniram, who is to be avenged; and of the word which is to berecove cd. 41 In the degree of elect, it trains the adepts to vengeance* without pointing out the p rson on whom it is to fall. It carries them back to the time • f the patriarchs, when, ac- cording to them, men knew no religion but that of nature, and when every body was equally priest and pontiff. But it had not as yet declared, that all religion revealed since the time of the patriarchs was to be thrown aside. 44 This last mystery is only developed in the Scotch de- grees. There the brethren are declared free; the word so long sought for is Deism; it is the worship of Jehovah; such as was known to the philosophers of nature. The true Mason becomes the Pontiff of Jehovah, and such is the grand mystery by which he is extricated from that dark- ness in which the profane are involved. 44 In the degree of Rosse Crucis, he who wrested the word, who destroyed the worship of Jehovah, is Christ himself, the author of Christianity ; and it is on the. gospel and on the Son of Man that the adept is to avenge the brethren, the Pontiffs of Jehovah. 44 At length, on his reception as Kadosch, he learns that the assassin of Adoniram is the king, who is to be killed to avenge the grand master Molay, and the order of the Ma- sons, successors to the Knights Templars. The religion"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"OF FREE MASONRY.  300  which is to be destroyed to recover the word, or the true doctrine, is the religion of Christ, founded on revelation. This word, in its full extent, is liberty and equality, to be established by the total • overthrow of the altar and the throne. u Such are the incipient degrees, the process, and the whole system of Masonry; it is thus that the sect, by its gradual explanation of its two-fold principle of liberty and equality, of its allegory of the founder of Masonry to be revenged, of the word to be recovered, leading the adepts from secret to secret, at length initiates them into the whole Jacobinical code of the revolution. 14 We are not to lose sight of the extreme care with which the adept is questioned on all that he has seen be* fore, whenever he is initiated to a new degrefc, lest he should overlook the intimate connexion subsisting between each; and thus, in the first degrees, liberty and equality are given to him as the secret, while the complete explanation and application of them form the mysteries of the last. 44 The more frightful these hidden mysteries of the lodges shall appear to the historian, the more strenuously it be- comes his duty to insist on the numbers of honest Masons, who never partook of these horrid mysteries. Nothing is more easy than to be duped in Masonry. Such may have been the lot of those who only seek to make acquaintance in the lodges, or to pass their leisure hours with men appa- rently intimate at first sight. It is true, that this intimacy seldom extends beyond the walls of the lodge; but the days of their meeting are often days of festivity. These repasts are certainly heightened by the temporary equality, which adds much to the mirth of the meeting; and all cares subside for ihe day. u What has been said of certain assemblies where de- cency was not respected, is most certainly the invention of calumny.

This monstrous Adonis disgusted all Strasburg, and was betrayed by the cries of the Egyptian sisters* It was no longer the age when the mysteries of the Adamites could be approved of. He was driven from that town for having attempted to introduce them. He would, in like manner, have ruined the craft, had he continued to con- found his lodges with those of the east Such was not the behaviour of our modern Masonry. On the contrary, it appeared, that it had neither religion nor government in view; and they were seldom mentioned in the generality of lodges. It was only on the day of initiation, that the re- flecting adept could surmise that it had any future object; but even on those very days, the trials were rather a subject of diversion than of reflection; and so far from meditating on the allegorical emblems, they were rather diverted from it by the sect, until favourable dispositions had been disco- vered in them for their farther initiation. The sect well knew, that a day would come, when a small number of the Occult Masons would suffice to put all the inferior multi- tude of. adepts in motion. It is thus that it may be easily explained, how there have existed so many honest Masons, and how so many are still to be found, who have never surmised any thing in their games, but the mysteries of an innocent Uberty and equality, no ways alluding either to re- ligion or to the state. \" In defence of English Masonry, we may add, that they allow only of the three first degrees. Prudence and wis- dom have made them reject the wish of avenging the death of Adoniram on his pretended assassin, a wish that we have seen converted, in the occult lodges into a desire of re- venging the Masons, and their founder, Molay, and then into a wish of avenging the masonic liberty and equality by the extinction of all kings. Nothing of this is to be found in the English Masonry. Nor is that mysterious pursuit of the word which was lost by Adoniram, to be traced. You are immediately informed that it is Jehovah. [Vide p. 160."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"OF FREE MASONRY.  311  of this volume.] He who could wish to draw certain infe- rences from this, would have a long course of reasoning to run through, none of which appear to have ever been thought of by the English Masons. With them, Jehovah is no more than the universal God of human nature; it is, to be sure, rather extraordinary, that they should pretend to be the only people who have any knowledge of that God; but their conclusion is, that all mankind, and particularly the Free Masons, ought to live with, and succour each other, like brethren. Nothing appears in their mysteries tending towards the hatred of Christianity, pr that of kings. \" Their laws and institutes, with respect to religion, are comprehended in declaring, * That a Mason will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious libertine. That though, in former times every Mason was obliged to profess the re- ligion of the state or nation he lived in, at present, leaving every one to enjoy his own private opinions, they- are only bound to follow the religion in which every body agrees; a religion which consists in being good, sincere, modest, and men of honour. 9 Certainly such laws do not oblige the English Mason to be a Deist, but only to be an honest man, whatever may be his religion. M With regard to the civil powers, a part of their laws are expressed as follows: * A Mason shall be a peaceable subject, and cheerfully conform to the laws of the country in which he resides. He shall not be concerned in plots or conspiracies against government; and he shall pay proper respect to the civil magistrate. Should a brother be impli- cated in rebellion against the state, he shall not be support- ed in his rebellion. 1 Such are the laws to be found in Tho- mas Wolson and William Preston, the one full of con- tempt, the other full of zeal for English Masonry; both, nevertheless, agree as to the laws of the lodges.

To our ears his language is occasionally severe; but then we forget that he lived in the darkest scenes created, not merely by the irreligious principles of Brother Frederic, Brother Voltaire, and Bro- ther Robinet! but by the active labours of Brother Orleans and Egalite, Brother Condorcet, and Brother Mirabeau I !* The lodges were the schoolrooms, these were the teach- ers, and 600,000 men of France were the pupils.

It seems, indeed, peculiarly suited to the talents and taste of that vain and ardent people.

The degrees afterwards superadded to this, leave us in doubt which of these views the French entertain of our Masonry. But at all events this rank of Scotch Knight was called the first degree of the Magon Parfait. \" In 1716, this, and still higher degrees of Masonry, were much in vogue in the Court of France. The refining ge- nius of the French, and their love of show, made the hum- ble denomination of the English brethren disgusting; and their passion for military rank, the only character that con- nected them with the court of an absolute monarch, made them adapt Free Masonry to the same scale of public esti- mation, and invent ranks of Magons Chevaliers, ornament- ed with titles, and ribbons, and stars. These were highly relished by that vain people; and the price of reception, which was very high, became a rich fund, that was gene- rously applied to relieve the wants of the banished British and Irish adherents of the unfortunate family who had ta- ' ken refuge among them. [The Stuarts, who carried Ma- sonry to France, as Mr. Robison supposes.] Three new degrees of Novice, Eleve, and Chevalier, were soon added, and the Parfait Magon had now seven receptions to go through, for each of which a handsome contribution was made. Afterwards, when the first beneficent purpose of this contribution ceased to exist, the finery that now glitter- ed in all the lodges made a still more craving demand for reception money, and ingenuity was set to work to invent new baits for the Parfait Magon. More degrees of chi- valry were added, interspersed with degrees of PhUosophe, Pellerin, Clairvoyant, &c. &c. till some Parisian lodges had forty-five ranks of Masonry, having fifteen orders of chivalry.* For a knighthood, with a ribbon and a star, was a bonrie bouche, given at every third step.

We generally consider a man, advanced in life, with less respect, if he shows any serious attachment to such things. But, in France, the civil and religious restraint on conversation, made these secret assemblies very precious; and they were much fre- quented by men of letters, who there found an opportunity of expressing in safety their dissatisfaction with those re- straints, and with that inferiority of rank and condition to which they were subjected, and which appeared to them- selves so inadequate to their own talents and merits. \" The Avocats do Parlement, the young men of no for- tune; the unbeneficed Abb&s, and the soi-disant philoso- phers, formed a numerous band, frequented the lodges, and there discussed every topic of religion and politics.

But the most remarkable performances of this kind are, the Archives Mystico-Hermetiques, and the Des Erreurs, ei de la Verite. The first is considered as an account historical and dogmatical, of the procedure and system of the Loge des Chevaliers Bienfaisants at Lyons. This was the most zealous and systematical of all the cosmopolitical lodges in France. It worked long under the patronage of its Grand Master the Due de Chartres, afterwards Orleans, and at last, Ph. Egalite. It sent out many affiliated lodges, which were erected in various parts of the French dominions. The daughter lodges at Paris, Strasbourg, Lille, Thoulouse, took the additional title of Philalethes. There arose some schisms, as maybe expected, in an .association where every man is encouraged to broach, and to propagate, any the most singular opinion. These schisms were continued with some heat, but were, in a great measure, repaired in lodges which took the name of Amis reuflis de la Verite. One of this denomination at Paris became very eminent. The mother lodge at Lyons extended its correspondence into Germany, and other foreign countries, and sent consti- tutions or systems by which the lodges conducted their ope- rations. \" The book Des Erreurs et de la Verite must, therefore, be considered as a classical book of these opinions.

They were called Martinets, from a St. Martin who founded a schisnt in the system of the Chevaliers Bien- faisants, of which we have not any very precise account. Mercier gives some account of it in his Tableau de Paris, and in his Annee, 1888. The breach alarmed the brethren, and occasioned great heats.

Free Masonry was imported into Germany somewhat later than into France. The first German lodge that we have any account of, is that at Cologne, erected in 1716, but very jsoon sup- pressed. Before the year 1725, there were many, both in Protestant and Catholic Germany. Those of Wetzlar, Frankfort on the Maine, Brunswick, and Hamburg, are the oldest, and their priority is doubtful. All of them re- ceived their institution from England, and had patents from the mother lodge in London. All seem to have got the mystery through the same channel, the banished friends of the Stuart family. Many of these were Catholics, and en- tered into the service of Austria and the Catholic princes. \" The true hospitality, that is no where more conspicuous than in the character of the Germans, made this institution a most agreeable and useful passport to these gentlemen; and as many of them were in military stations, and in garri- sons they found it a very easy matter to set up lodges in all parts of Germany. These afforded a very agreeable pastime to the officers, who had little to occupy them, and were already accustomed to a subordination which did not affect their vanity on account of family distinctions. As"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"328  PROFESSOR ROBISON'S VIEWS the ensign and the general were equally gentlemen, the allegory, or play of universal brotherhood, Was neither no- vel nor disgusting. Free Masonry was then of the simplest form, consisting of the three degrees of apprentice, fellow craft, and master. It is remarkable, that the Germans had been long accustomed to the word, the sign, and the grip of the Masons, and some other handicraft trades. In many parts of Germany there was a distinction of operative Ma- sons into Wort Maurers and Schrift Maurers. [Word Masons, and Writ Masons.] The Wort Maurers had no other proof to give of their having been regularly brought up to the trade of builders but by the word and signs; the Schrift Maurers had written indentures to show. < \" There are extant, ana* in force, borough laws, enjoining the masters of Masons to give employment to journeymen who had the proper word and signs. In particular, it ap- pears, that some cities had more extensive privileges, in this respect than others. The word given at Wetzl&r, the seat of the great council of revision for the empire, entitled the possessor to work over the whole empire. We may infer, from the processes and decisions in some of those munici- pal courts, that a master gave a word and token for each year's progress of his apprentice. He gave the word of the incorporated imperial city or borough on which he de- pended, and also a word peculiar to himself, by which all his own pupils would recognise each other. \" This mode of recognizance was probably the only docu- ment of education in old times, while writing was confined to a very small part of the community,\" (P. 56.) \" The Germans have always exhibited a strong hankering after every thing that is wonderful, or solemn, or terrible; have always furnished partisans in the foremost ranks of gross absurdities, listening with greedy ears to the nonsense and jargon of fanatics and cheats; and though they every day see examples of many ruined, or rendered ridiculous by their credulity, new pretenders to"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"OF fBU MASONRY* 329 secrets find numbers ready to listen to them, and to run over the same course. \" Free Masonry, professing mysteries, instantly roused these people, and the lodges appeared to the adventurers who wanted to profit by the enthusiasm, or the aoarice of their dupes* the fittest places m the world for the scene of their operations. The Rosierucians were the first who availed themselves of the opportunity. This was not the society which had appeared formerly under that name, and was now extinct; but a set of Alchymist*, pretenders to the transmutation of metals and the universal medicine, who, the better to inveigle their votaries, had mixed with their own tricks, a good deal of the absurd superstitions of that sect, in order to give a greater air of mystery to the whole, to protract the time of instruction, and to afford more room for evasions, by making so many difficult con- ditions necessary for perfecting the grand work, that the unfortunate gull, who had thrown away his time and his money, might believe that the failure was owing to his own incapacity or unfitness for being the possessor of the grand secret 19   I   (P. 64) \" The German Masons, however, did one sensible thing; they sent a deputation to .Old Aberdeen, Scotland, to inquire alter the caves where their venerable mysteries were known, and their treasures were hid.

They said, that the homespun Free Masonry, which had been imported from England, was fit only for the unpolished minds of the British; but that in France it had grown into an elegant system, fit for the pro* fession of gentlemen. Nay, they said, that the English were ignorant of true Masonry, and possessed nothing but the introduction to it; and even this urns not understood by them. When the ribbons and stars, with which the French had ornamented the order, were shown to the Germans, they could not resist the enchantment A Mr. Rosa, a French commissary, brought from Paris a complete wa- gon-load of Masonic ornaments, which were all distributed before it had reached Berlin, and he was obliged to order another, to furnish the lodges of that city. It became for a while a most profitable business to many French officers and commissaries dispersed over Germany, having nothing els^ to do. Every body gaped for instruction, and these kind teachers were always ready to bestow it. In half a year Free Masonry underwent a complete revolution all over Germany, and Chevaliers (Knights) multiplied without number. The Rosaic system was a gospel to the Masons, and the poor British system was despised. But the new lodges of Berlin, as they had been the teachers of the whole empire, wanted also to be the governors, and insist- ed on complete subjection from all others. This startled the Free Masons at a distance, and awaked them from their golden dreams. Now began a struggle for dorainion and for independency. This made the old lodges think a little about the whole affair. The result of this was a counter revolution. \" Though no man could pretend that he Understood the true meaning of Free Masonry, its origin, its history, or its real aim, all saw that the interpretations of their hiero- glyphics, and the rituals of the new degrees imported from France, were quite gratuitous.

Many lodges, therefore, applied for patents and instruc- tions. Patents were easily made out, and most willingly sent to the zealous brethren, and these were thankfully re- ceived and paid for. But instruction was not so easy a mat- ter. At that time we had nothing but the Book of Consti- tutions, dawn up about 1720, by Anderson and Desaguil- tiers, two persons of little education, and of low manners, who had aimed at little more than making a pretext, not altogether contemptible, for a convivial meeting.. This, how- ever, was received with respect. We are apt to smile at grave men's being satisfied with feuch coarse and scanty fare. But it was of use merely because it gave an ostensi- ble reason for resisting the despotism of the lodges of Ber- lin. Several respectable lodges, particularly that of Frank- fort on the Maine, that of Wetzlar, and the Royal York of Berlin, resolutely adhered to the English system, and denied themselves all the enjoyments of the French de- grees, rather than acknowledge the supremacy of the Mo- saic lodges of Berlin.\" Professor Robison is qualified to speak of Free Masonry. He was a scholar, had taken its higher degrees, had taken a part in its lod^s in the various capitals of Europe, en- joyed its privileges of introduction to a high degree, and sometimes speaks of it with a weakness scarce pardona- ble: \"innocent hypocrisy; 91 \"a pretext for a convivial meeting not altogether contemptible;\" yet how frivolous and vain he makes it appear!

The particulars are numerous and interesting, but we must come at once to the conclusion. (P. 75.) \" And thus it appears, that Germany has ex* perienced the same gradual progress from religion to Athe* ism, from decency to dissoluteness, and from loyalty to re- bellion, which has had its course in France. And I must now add, that this progress has been effected in the same manner, and by the same means; and that one of the chief means of seduction has been the lodges of the Free Masons. The French, along with their numerous orders of knighthood, and stars, and ribbons, had brought in the custom of ha* ranguing in the lodges; and as human nature has a conn-* derable uniformity every where, the same topics became favourite subjects of declamation that had tickled the ear in Franee: there were the qame corruptions of sentiments and manners among the luxurious or profligate, and the same incitements to the utterance of these sentiments, wherever it could be done with safety; and, I may say, that the zealots in all these tracts of free*thinking, were more serious, more grave, and fanatical. These are not assertions a priori. I can produce proofs.

I cannot enter upon this subject farther, without express- ing my high consideration of the Abbe BarruePs treatise upon the Illuminees: to him I am most indebted.

Every considerable town, too, had its name of IHuimnism; and every kingdom. They wrote also in cipher, the different degrees having different hiero- glyphics. Their papers were seized by the different go- vernments of Germany and published; and their whole aim was completely detected and exposed by these, and by the confessions of the disappointed of their order. In speaking of the principals, I will give both their own name, and their name of adoption. It is worthy of remark, that the names they affected were such as honest men would hate. The founder and builder, Adam Weishaupt, took the name of Spartacus, a gladiator of ancient Rome, who, in a desperate rebellion of three years, caused scarce- ly less danger to the commonwealth than Hannibal had done. It would be odious to place this man before the reader in the depravity of his private life, with the full blase of proof upon his countenance. And to call him by the epithets he deserves for his base immorality, would unne- cessarily disfigure the page. It is enough to say, that he gave fidl proof, in his own life, of the detestable nature of the false principles which guided him, and which he zea- lously communicated to others. Though of mean birth, his talents and acquirements were sufficient to gain for him the Professorship of Laws in die University of Ingolstadt, in Bavaria; his native country, before he had attained his twenty-eighth y^ar; and before he was thirty he had plans in operation for the reformation of the world, by the destruction of all religious principles.

It is important, too, as it gives the Free Mason an undue advantage over his fellow citizens not mason?. Two men of a trade or profession, equally deserving public favour, but one a Free Mason and the other not, the fraternity are bound by their Masonic obligations, to employ and prefer the brother Mason. The Mason may think this is quite right; but the honest mechanic, who is left with a bare support, to contend both against the hardships of poverty, and the secret influ- ence of a selfish fraternity, will most certainly complain. The known advantage of the patronage of the craft, is undoubtedly the reason why thousands of young men, feeling about them for supports in the first part of the du- ties of life, have entered into the fellowship of the lodges; and the countenance and support they have received from acquaintances formed there, will he, perhaps, the most powerful bond of attachment to the interests of this mys- terious association.

It is true, the candidate invokes a cruel death, which would make a com- mon executioner shudder to inflict; but if one acknow- ledges any power short of the Supreme, adequate to inflict that death, he errs. This would be effectually clearing a transgressor from all danger of the precise death invoked; but it is leaving the case with Him who will not suffer the wicked to go un- punished, and who, \" after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell.\"— (Luke, xii. 5.) The novice is now ready for promotion. He is caused by his introducer to request the protection of the order.

At the rate Pres- ton, Webb, Cross, and a host, pretend they learn in the three first degrees, if Masons do not begin to unlearn by the time they reach the twelfth or fifteenth degree, they must get out of all known materials of acquisition. This fact will be very plain, when it is recollected, that in the sin- gle degree of fellow craft, if we may believe these renown- ed Free Masons, are taught the five noble orders of archi- tecture, and the seven liberal arts and sciences, to perfec- tion.

The nation know, and it is the reproach of the state, that on any question of great public interest, the decision of New-York cannot be calculated from her past expres- sions at the polls, within any definable limits; a difference of 20,000 votes sometimes occurring in a very short pe- riod. Again, Connecticut, on the eastern border of New-York, is not less celebrated for her steady habits. None can fail to have observed this, who notice the events of past times. Connecticut has a soil proverbial among the fraternity for the stinted growth of Free Masonry; and in New- York, this society has pushed deeply its roots, enlarged its trunk, and spread abroad its branches, flourishing and tow- ering like a plane tree in the rich vale of the Ohio. It is not only in mechanics that action and reaction are equal. The habits of Connecticut and New-York have not been inert under the action of Free Masonry, nor has Free Masonry failed to exert a powerful influence on the morals and politics of the chief state of the union. The contests of Clinton and Tompkins for the chair of the grand master were parallel in the fraternity to the po- litical struggle of the same candidates for the office of go* vernor of New-York.

Having dwelt at length upon the great objects of his as- sociation, enumerating the obstacles to be overcome, and the supports to be derived from various sources, Weishaupt, in view of the necessary coadjutors in his work of moral reformation, exclaims: (R. p. 93.) \" But where are the proper persons, the good, the generous, and the accomplished, to be found ?

Our task, therefore, is doubled. We must give such an account of things, that fanatics shall not be alarmed, and that shall, notwithstanding, excite a spirit of free inquiry.

This increases every day. But, then, the spirit of freedom breathes and sighs in every corner; and, by the assistance of hidden schools of wisdom, liberty and equality, the natural and imprescripti- ble rights of man, warm and glow in every breast We must, therefore, unite these extremes. We proceed in this manner. \" Jesus Christ established no new religion; he would only set religion and reason in their ancient rights. For this purpose he would unite men in a commbn bond. He would fit them for this by spreading a just morality; by en- lightening the understanding, and by assisting the mind to shake off all prejudices. He would teach all men, in the first place, to govern .themselves. Rulers would then be needless, and equality and liberty would take place without any revolution, by the natural and gentle operation of rear son and expediency. This great teacher allows himself to explain every part of the Bible in conformity to these pur- poses ; and he forbids all wrangling among his scholars, because every man may there find a reasonable application to his peculiar doctrines. Let this be true or false, it does not signify. This was a simple religion, and it was so far inspired; but the minds of his hearers were not fitted for receiving these doctrines. ' I told you,' says he, ' but y& could not bear it 1 Many, therefore, were called, but few chosen. To these elect were intrusted the most important secrets; and even among them there were degrees of in- formation. There was a seventy, and a twelve. All this was in the natural order of things, and according to the habits of the Jews, and, indeed, of all antiquity. The Jewish Theosophy was a mystery ; like the Eleusinian, or the Pythagorean, unfit for the vulgar. And thus the doc- trines of Christianity were committed to the Adepti, in a Disciplina Arcani. By these they were maintained like the vestal fire. They were kept up, only in hidden societies, who handed them down to posterity; and they are now pos- sessed by the genuine Free Masons\""},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"364  ItLUJUNISM.  N. B. \" This explains,\" says Professor Robison, \" the origin of many anonymous pamphlets which appeared about this time in Germany, showing that Free Masonry teas Christianity. They liave, doubtless, been the works of Spartacus and his partisans among the Eclectic Masons. Nicholai, the great apostle of infidelity, had given very fa- vourable reviews of these performances, and having always shown himself an advocate of such writers as depreciated Christianity, it was natural for him to take this opportunity of bringing it still lower in the opinion of the people. Spar- tacus, therefore, conceived a high opinion of the impor- tance of gaining him to the order, and exults exceedingly in the acquisition, saying, \"that he was an unwearied champion, et quidem contentissimus.\" [He took the name of Lucian, the ancient scoffer.] Of this man, Philo says, u that he spread this Christianity into every corner of Ger- many.\"    ,    \" I have put meaning,\" says Philo, u to all the dark sym- bols, and have prepared two degrees, introducing beautiful ceremonies, which I have selected from among those of the ancient communions, combined with those of the Rosaac Masonry; and now,\" says he, \" it will appear that we are the only true Christians. We shall now be in a condition to say a few words to priests and princes. I have so con- trived things, that I would admit even pope? and kings, af- ter the trials which I have prefixed; and they would be glad to be of the order.\" This Philo-Knigge is the famous Free Mason mentioned by Professor Robison. (p. 332.) He subdivides the adepts of Illuniinism into two classes; those who scoff at revela- tion, and those who need a revealed religion to fix then- ideas. To explain this he writes to Cato, (that is Zwack,) in the following terms. (B. p. 121.) \"To unite these two classes of men, to make them concur and co-operate towards our object, it was necessary to represent Christianity in such a light, as to recall the superstitious to reason, and to teach our more"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"4 iLLuaciKiM.  385  enlightened sages not to reject it on account of its abuse. ' This should have been the secret -of Masonry, and have led lis to our object Meanwhile despotism strengthens daily, though liberty universally keeps pace with it It was neces* eaxy then to unite the extremes. We therefore assert here, that Christ did not establish a new religion, but that his in- tention was simply to reinstate natural religion in its rights; that by giving a general bond of union to the world, by diffusing the light and wisdom of his morality, and by dissipating prejudices, ?us intention was to teachus the means of governing ourselves, and to re-establish, without the vUh lent means of revolutions, the reign of liberty and equality among men. This was easily done by quoting certain texts from scripture, and by giving explanations of them,4rif* or false is of little consequence, provided each one finds a sense in these doctrines consonant with his reason. We add, that this religion, so simple in itself, was afterwards de- faced ; but that fry means of inviolable secrecy, it has been transmitted in purity to us through Free Masonry.\" \" Sparta- £us (Weishaupt) had collected many materials for this, and I added my discoveries in the instruction for these two de- grees. Our people, therefore, being convinced that we alone are possessed of the real secrets of Christianity, we have but to add a few words against the clergy and prin- ces. In the last mysteries we have to unfold to our adepts this pious fraud, and then by writings demonstrate the ori- gin* of all religious impositions, and their mutual connex- ion with the other.\" (R. p. 169.) Again, Philo says,\" I have been at unwea- ried pains to remove the fears of some, who imagine that our superiors want to abolish Christianity;, but by and by their prejudices will wear off, and they will be more at their ease.

To what may est thou not be persua- ded/\" This is the language of truth and soberness. The very aim of those dark conspirators of the old world, has been, in one essential feature, aided materially by the Masons in the New. I know, brethren, \" that through ignorance ye did it.\" But what induced that ignorance ? what led to the unhallowed deed ? what has so long concealed it from the searchings of conscience, and from the reproof of the just ? A fond attachment to a nocturnal association, blinding the eyes, and perverting the heart, is both the source and the support of this singular delusion. (B. p, 1524.) \" We must, first,\" says Spartacus, \" gradu- ally explain away all our preparatory pious frauds. And when persons of discernment find fault, we must desire them to consider the end of all our labour. This sanctifies our means, which, at any rate, are harmless,and have been useful, even in this case; because they procured us a patient hearing, when, otherwise, men would have turned away from us like pet- ted children. This will convince them of our sentiments in all the intervening points; and our ambiguous expres- sions will then be interpreted into an endeavour to draw answers of any kind, which may show us the minds of our pupils.

These things he calls preparatory pious frauds, which are gradually to be explained away; and then he unfolds, from history, the origin and fabrication of ail religious lies whatever. No, it is not art; it is depraved cunning, joined with inhuman malice; it is the serpent writhing his secret way to nestle in the open bosom. Free Masonry afforded a shelter for Weishaupt; she masked his batteries; she co- vered his attacks; she divided and distracted his enemies, the friends of civil government and religion ; she enlisted his recruits; she disseminated his doctrines.. She did; and if this were all, we might forgive her; but she has never ceased to do it. Weishaupt is forgotten, but his doctrines and his disciples live. JUuminism is accursed, but it costs her pupils nothing to change the name, and re- tain the principles. They have done it. The name is abandoned, as the name of Free Masonry eventually must be; but the principles find a channel for themselves, and they will find one in every large community. Falsehood is their life; yet, to be current, they must appear fair and true. They, therefore, assume the form least to be feared or doubted; they attach themselves to morality and piety, as very important to screen them from suspicion, though quite in the way of their ulterior designs. We have no reason to be anxious; we have abundant reason to be on the alert; and only one rule upon this head will always serve, i. e. to punish JUuminism under whatever cloak we find it."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"368 ILLUMINISM.

We see that their uniform progress has been from frivolity and nonsense, to wickedness and sedition. Weis- haupt has been at great pains to show the good effects of secrecy in the association, and the arguments are valid for his purpose. But all his arguments are so many dissuasive advices to every thinking and sober mind. The man who really wishes to discover an abstruse truth, will place him- self, if possible, in a calm situation, and will by no means expose himself to the impatient hankering for secrets and wonders; and be will always fear, that a thing which reso- lutely conceals itself cannot bear the light.\" [i. e.JFree Ma- sonry.] 49"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"386  PROFESSOR ROBlSON f S \" All who have seriously employed themselves in the discovery of truth, have found the great advantage of open communication of sentiment.

And, accordingly, we see, that in every quarter of Europe where Free Masonry has been establish- ed, the lodges have become seed beds of public mischief I believe that no ordinary brother will say, that the occupa- tions in the lodges are any thing better than frivolous, and very frivolous indeed. [So mote it be.] The distribution of charity needs be no secret, and it is but a very small part of the employment of the meeting. This being the case, his in human nature, that the greater we suppose the frivolty of such association to be, the greater chance of its ceasing to give sufficient occupation to the mind, and the greater is the risk that the meetings may be employed to other purposes which require concealment.

The desire of making proselytes is in every breast—and it is whetted by the restraints of society. And all countries have discontented men, whose grumblings will raise discontent in others, who might not have attended to some of the trifling hardships and injuries they met with, had they not been reminded of them. To be discontented, ana not to think of schemes of redress, is what we> cannot think natural or manly; and where can such sentiments and schemes find such safe utterance, and such probable support, as in a secret society ? Free Masonry is [not] in- nocent of all these things, but Free Masonry has been abused, and at last totally perverted; and so will, and must, any such secret association, as long as men are licentious in their opinions, or wicked in their dispositions. M It were devoutly to be wished, therefore, that the whole fraternity would imitate the truly benevolent conduct of those German lodges who have formally broken tip, and made a patriotic sacrifice of their amusement to the safety of the state. I cannot think the sacrifice great or costly. It can be no difficult matter to find as pleasant a way of passing a vacant hour; and the charitable deeds of the members need not diminish in the smallest degree. Every person's little circle of acquaintance will give him opportu- nities of gratifying his kind dispositions, without the chance of being mistaken in the worth of the persons on whom he bestows his favours. \" But not only are secret societies dangerous, but all so- ' cieties whose object is mysterious.

Now, for what was the fire* three years before kindled by the scrupulous brethren, except, by destroying the re- cords, to throw an air of mystery over the monstrous birth they were hatching ? It is but too plain: for Preston, Law- rie, Smith, and others, agree to state, that Free Masonry first went from this same mother lodge to India, in 1728-9, and to America, in 1730; to Gibraltar and Madrid, 1727, and to Saxony, 1730. \" From this period,\" says u the re- nowned historian of Free Masonry,\" Mr. William Preston, from 1730 \"we may date the commencement of the conse- quence and reputation of the society m Europe, as daily ap- plications were made for constituting new lodges, and the most respectable characters of the age desired their names to be enrolled in our records. 11 (Illustrations of Masonry, p. 180.

In 1730, the limit in America was three. In 1797, a push was made to seven. In 1801, the sove- reign inspectors announced thirty-three in direct ascent, and twenty collateral degrees. (See Jkddufs Orations.) In 1816, the number in direct ascent was increased to forty-three. (See F- M. L.) And now why not go to ninety? It is done. I have before me, in fair type, the names, and the numbers against the names, of ninety de- grees of Free Masonry as given in Europe in 1825. They are in French, divided into four series; the first of thirty- three symbolic degrees; the second of thirty-three philo- sophic degrees; the third of eleven mystic degrees, and the fourth of thirteen hermetic and cabalistic degrees. The four series are again divided into seventeen classes. The last I copy for the satisfaction of the brethren; but let me not attempt to translate the universal language. \" 17th Class. 87°.

Masonics, could never again run the lines and establish the corners; without a very free use of her faculty of Abrac. It has not fared better with our ancient customs and usa- ges. Time was when men disabled in body or limbs, men of mean parentage, and without some reputable mode of obtaining a living, were excluded from our privileges. But the licentiousness of modern times makes little account of these wholesome regulations, admits the halt, the maimed r and the disreputable alike; and this to an extent that we are sometimes pinched for want of honourable men to sus- tain the dignities of the society; ojiir very grand masters being lifted up by their station. And, if only men were ad- mitted, we might yet hopet, that some Napoleon in.Mason- ry, by a complete overthrow of the temple, would remodel it upon the ancient foundation, according to the usages of antiquity; but wKh the admission of ladies, all hope is lost. Once a Mason always a Mason; the ladies have their lodges, their fetes, their funerals; the ship is lost, we can- not hinder it; we have only to seize a plank, and save our own lives. Again, our emblems were our boast. We learned to cir- cumscribe our passions by the compasses; to do as we would be done by, upon the square; and freedom, fervency, and zeal, were deeply instilled into our minds with chalk, charcoal, and clay. We could see the very image of inno- cence in our white aprons, the frailty of mortal hopes in a broken column, and the truth of history in the death of Hi- ram. But another has robbed us of our art; an infernal grand master has entered into our schools, takes our mas- ter's gavel to knock off all religious prejudices, the trestle- board of Hiram to draw schemes of infidelity, and the Ma- son's trowel to spread the cement of hatred to the cross.. It is high time for common men to forsake the school. In view of these things, brethren, it had been my duty as a master Mason, to confer with you plainly upon this subject; (Vide Master's Charge;) my duty as one appointed \" to cor- rect irregularities\" \" to preserve unsullied the reputation of"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. 395 tAe fraternity,\" and to whom \" the ancient land-marks of the vrder are intrusted ;\" as one charged \" never to suffer a devia- tion from the established usages and customs of the frater- nity,\" and to \"let no motive make me swerve from duty, violate my vows, or betray my trust;\" to address you, brethren, freely, as I have done in this volume, upon the subject of Masonry. None can deny it: but I renounce the harlot, I serve a better master, obey a holier command- ment, and address you in the name of your country, and of your religion, your children, and your immortal hopes. I have no apology to make for disrespect to Masonry; but if, in the heat of the battle, or in the ardour of the pursuit, I have once been unkind toward brethren, my countrymen, and my friends, I regret it Lodges and grand lodges with their seals, authors and orators with their ef- forts, are her organs, and have necessarily shared more or less with her in condemnation. As organs of Free Ma- sonry, I can proffer no apology to them; but, if at any mo- ment, sentiments have been uttered disrespectful to them, except as the organs of Free Masonry, I regret it. You, reader, may be free to laugh at Free Masons, but the writer is not He was lawfully made, in a legally con- stituted lodge of Free Masons, and has never openly signi- fied to his lodge, nor to any lodge, that he should have no more concern with the Daughter of the Night Until he has so signified to his lodge, his name supports the fraterni- ty $ and he will not revile the men. who compose it He will respect and honour them. They have been led in by a good motive, and have not yet seen cause for so extreme measures as attend a public disavowal of Free Masonry. But the writer has seen cause, and will take an early op- portunity, formally to withdraw his name from the lodge. Others, having studied the subject, as he ha* studied it, will revolt from it too: even reading the result of his labours, they will have less relish for the lodges, less zeal for the chapters, less eagerness in pursuit of the secret, less ambi- tion to become great Masons, less love of Masonic pomp, aprons, and sashes, and titles."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"396  CONCLUSION.  The glory of Us darkness has departed from Free Ma- sonry, and none is left it save the honour of the gentlemen - who support it; men more honouring than honoured The present state of things will not long continue. The sober part of the members will secretly or openly forsake the nocturnal assembly; the more sensible will avoid being seen in public, childishly girt with a feminine badge,\" more ancient than the golden fleece, or Roman eagle, more ho- nourable than the star and garter, or any other order which can be conferred by any king, prince, potentate, or other person, except he be a Mason, 19 viz. a white leather apron. The society will fall entirely into the hands of the igno- rant and selfish. And who will have the courage to rescue it from their hands ? What good man will enter its dark yaults to control the spirits who will assemble there ? Not one who prizes his good name enough to avoid bad com* pany ; not one who is unwilling to countenance dark delu- sion, at the risk of being accounted simple, or deeply de- signing ; not one who has understanding to perceive, that in supporting a hypocritical mystery, he will stand convict- ed before the public of some base purpose, some pursuit of darkness, some selfish aim, which, to succeed, must, like the fallen angel, \" be cautious of day.\" Such there are, and will be. To them Free Masonry is suitable; they are welcome to it. But the virtuous and upright, the pious and faithful, the just and true, have no proper connexion with Free Masonry; those who revere the testimony of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, \" Whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels:\" to them I call, in the language of the prophet, \" Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\" THE END."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"TABLE OF CONTENTS.
