This is not so. The great Obediences remain closed to this type of passion and continue to follow (dare we say religiously ?) the secular traditions of tolerance, moral elevation and intellectualism which, in the 18 th Century, enjoyed the approbation of all cultivated society. Let us never forget what Queen Marie-Antoinette said to her mother, the Empress of Austria: “Everybody is one...” Manifestations present in all human teaching, idiotic persecutions and sectarianism made the Order move towards taking a defensive attitude towards its own principles, without which its very soul would be affected. We remember that in Malta, during the Napoleonic wars, some French prisoners who were Masons, who had set up a Lodge with permission of their English ”Brothers” found themselves attacked by a large crowd of Maltese peasants armed with pitchforks and scythes. The local Catholic clergy had accused the French Masons of “flying in circles, like swallows, above the village, performing conjurations...”. After the sack of the premises, the clergy came in procession to exorcize the place. This is one example from among hundreds. The preceding edition only contained the rites of the very old Rite of Memphis . Now more recent formulations have been added to it; such as the Conjugal Recognition Ceremony, the Baptism of a Louveteau 1 , a Funeral Service, a Ritual for a Banquet of the Order (part ritual, part open), and a Masonic Death. To be comprehensive, it was necessary to include the Rituals of the Rite of Memphis , a little older still, since from the unification of the two Rites by Garibaldi, they have formed but a single Obedience. In preparing it for commercial publication, certain details had inevitably been omitted; other details are missing from the manuscripts of those times, for they were always transmitted by word of mouth and never written down. It was ever thus for a great number of details pertaining to Masonic life, and we respect this custom. Finally, let us remember that publication of these rituals was unanimously approved by the great International Convent of Paris in 1966. We mention this in order to silence the demented lucubrations of certain fanatical adversaries. We are not violating any obligations of silence...   1 The French word used is Louveteau , which literally means ‘wolf-cub’. In English tradition the son of a Mason is traditionally termed a Lewis , after the cramp which is used to grip stones when being raised by pulleys, probably to indicate his responsibility for looking after his father, represented by the stone. However, since the French word carries other connotations it has been preserved here."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 T O T HE G LORY O F T HE G RAND A RCHITECT O F T HE U NIVERSE Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm SYMBOLIC GRAND LODGE The Convent of Lodges of our Rite for Europe and Africa (France, Belgium, Switzerland, Netherlands (Central African Republic), Madagascar) and Venezuela, laying down its foundations for the year 1965 C.E., having decided with complete unanimity to have the Rituals for the three grades of “Symbolic” Masonry (excluding the Instructions , Words and Probatory Signs ) published – as much to dispel the malevolent stories about Masonic Ceremonies spread abroad by our constant adversaries as to deliver a uniform and complete set of Rituals to our Blue Lodges – the current edition is therefore created and offered in consequence of this decision by the aforementioned Convent. Global unity of the Rite having being realized with our Grand Lodges in Latin America (Chile, Bolivia, Argentina), it is understood that these, who were still not represented at the Convent of 1965, remain free either to preserve the present Rituals in use or to rally to the decision of the Grand Lodges of Europe, Africa and Madagascar.

THE RITE OF MEMPHIS-MIZRAÏM This Obedience, which will commemorate its second centenary in 1988, resulted from the fusion of the two Rites of M IZRAÏM and M EMPHIS which was undertaken in 1881 by G ARIBALDI , who was the first Grand Master-General. The Rite of M IZRAÏM had been constituted in 1778 at Venice; it took its line from C AGLIOSTRO , who had himself received the lower grades from the Grand Lodge of E NGLAND , and the high grades of German Templar Masonry. The Rite of M EMPHIS was constituted at Montauban in 1815 by Masons who had participated in the Mission to Egypt with Bonaparte. Other initiatic Grades coming from the ancient esoteric Obediences of the 18 th Century were associated with these two Obediences: the P RIMITIVE Rite, Rite of the P HILADELPHIANS , etc. In the 19 th Century, M IZRAÏM and M EMPHIS were the two Obediences from which the Carbonari 2 were recruited. They had numerous Lodges in France, and counted among their dignitaries very important people, including the Duc de D ECAZES and Compte M URAIRE , Grand Commander of the S COTTISH Rite to mention but two. At the present time in international Masonry, M EMPHIS - M IZRAÏM can count around five thousand five hundred members, grouped in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Venezuela, Haiti), Australia, and Europe (Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, France). In France the Obedience is above all a place of assembly for Masons who are generally in the higher grades, who belong to the G RAND -O RIENT DE F RANCE , to the G RANDE L OGE DE F RANCE , to the G RANDE L OGE N ATIONALE F RANÇAISE “Opéra”, and who are joined by a mutual attraction to Esotericism, Occultism, Symbolism, etc. It is in sum a crossroads or meeting-place. However, except in France it only has about thirty Lodges, not including the higher Lodges where one can find those Masons of all Obediences who are most qualified in the realm of the Occult and Esotericism; and some of these are in fact the heads of other Organizations of this genre, which are more secretive. Moreover, the Rite of M EMPHIS - M IZRAÏM continues the tradition of adhering to those principles of tolerance and freedom of thought which in the 19 th Century, during the White Terror 3 , made it the refuge and nursery of the Carbonari .   2 Lit: Charcoal-burners . This was the name of a secret political society, which played an important part, chiefly in France and Italy, during the first decades of the nineteenth century, mainly in deposing lawful monarchs and stirring insurrection. Their rites were very similar to Freemasonry and led to the edict against secret societies (esp. Freemasonry and Carbonari) in 1814 by Cardinals Consalvi and Pacca . 3 The Terreur Blanche or ‘White Terror’ was a counter-revolutionary movement led by royalists following the fall of Napoleon. Armed bands, called verdets , massacred revolutionaries and Protestants. Following the success of the ultraroyalists in the elections of 1815 the White Terror was institutionalized, and those"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 THE RITE OF MIZRAÏM This Rite appeared for the first time in Venice in 1788. A group of Socinians (an anti-Trinitarian Protestant sect) requested a patent from Cagliostro, then from Trente 4 . Not wishing to practice the magical-kabbalistic rituals of the latter, they chose to work the Templar Rite . Cagliostro thus gave them only Masonic light; he held the first three Degrees of English Masonry, and the higher Grades of German Masonry which were strongly marked by the templar tradition. The name Mizraïm is simply the plural of Egyptian , the only reminder of this Egyptian Rite which transmitted to them the authority for the Obedience. It hived off rapidly to Milan, Genoa, Naples and appeared in France through Michel Bédarride, who have received the magisterial powers in 1810 in Naples, from Bro. De Lassalle. From 1810 to 1811 the three Bédarride brothers successfully developed the Rite in France, to all intents and purposes under the protection of the Scottish Rite. Indeed, it could count several illustrious Masonic names at its head: the Comte Muraire, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, the Duc Decazes, the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Leicester, Lieutenant-General Baron Teste, etc. Just before the White Terror it quickly became the Masonic Obedience which transmitted the required mastership to the Carbonari , and this Rite amassed 22 Lodges in Paris, 6 at Lyons, 6 at Metz, 5 in Toulouse, 3 I Bordeaux, 3 in Geneva, 2 in Lausanne, and 1 at Courtray. Violently anticlerical 5 , antiroyalist, the police of the Restoration had it dissolved. Clandestine for eighteen years, it was restored in 1838, only to be dissolved once more in 1841. It arose once more from a clandestine existence in 1848. Mizraïm made its way towards joining with the Rite of Memphis in 1881, a fusion which was the work of Garibaldi. THE RITE OF MEMPHIS The majority of members who accompanied Bonaparte on the Mission of Egypt were Masons from the ancient initiatic Rites: the Philalethes , the African Brethren , the Hermetic Rite , the Philadelphians , the Primitive Rite , not to mention the Grand-Orient de France . Having discovered a gnostic-hermetic survival in Cairo, and then the Druze Masonry encountered by Gérard de Nerval in the Lebanon which could be traced back to the Operative Masons who had accompanied the Templars – their protectors – there, the Brothers in the Mission to Egypt in consequence decided henceforth to renounce their Masonic lineage which came from the Grand Lodge in London , and to set out once more in a new Rite, which owed nothing to England, then Enemy Number One. Thus, under the guidance of Samuel Honis and Marconis de Nègre, the Rite of Memphis was born in Montauban, in 1815.       associated with the Revolution or Napoleon’s Empire executed. It was finally dissolved by Louis XVIII in 1816. 4 He came to Venice and remained there for six weeks. 5 But still thoroughly deist and spiritual, as can be seen from the rituals."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 With great speed, just as the Rite of Mizraïm had brought together nostalgic Jacobeans and the Carbonari , the Rite of Memphis regrouped those in the pay of the ex- Grand Army and the Bonaparte-ists who remained loyal to the Eagle 6 . In 1816 the two Rites had the same Grand Master-General, which would permit a future fusion. Bt the Grand-Orient was still mainly composed of monarchists, its seal carrying the fleur de lys , and it secured the dissolution of Memphis . This did not last, and in 1826 this Rite took up its labors once more under the Obedience of the selfsame Grand-Orient . Dissolved in 1841, just like Mizraïm , Memphis also became clandestine, and only reappeared in plain view in 1848 with the Republic. Dissolved once more in 1850, reawakened in 1853, Memphis joined with the Grand-Orient in 1862, compelled to by a decision of the Prince- President. Having many Lodges abroad by now, it attracted illustrious names, such as Louis Blanc and Garibaldi, who was soon to be the unifier of Memphis and Mizraïm . THE RITE OF MEMPHIS-MIZRAÏM Up to 1881, the Rites of Memphis and Mizraïm proceeded in parallel and in concert, in a very extraordinary atmosphere; indeed, these Rites both began to gather Masons from the Grand-Orient de France and the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite who were interested in studies pertaining to the esotericism of Masonic symbolism, gnosis, Kabbalah, also Hermeticism and occultism. Now, these two Rites were the inheritors and depositaries of the old initiatic Obediences of the 18 th Century: the Philalethes , the Philadelphians , the Hermetic Rite , the Primitive Rite , etc. And all this was represented in Mizraïm in 90 different grades, and in Memphis , by 95. How to administrate and make use of this great disparate ensemble? When Garibaldi was designated first Grand Master- General ad vitam for the entire world (since Brothers abroad had not suffered political persecution as in France), he established a type of classification which was not at all hierarchical in the beginning, but which quickly became so. In fact, the 95 degrees of the Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm should be considered to be an ambulatory, where the old Masonic degrees which were no longer or rarely practiced, and not as a series of values, are to be found. Moreover, the accords of 1863 with the Grand-Orient of France , and 1896 with the Symbolic Scottish Grand Lodge , the future Grand Lodge of France only treated on the 33 classic degrees (the Rite of Perfection , followed by the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite). The higher echelons of Memphis-Mizraïm compulsorily practiced: the 9 th Degree (Master-Elect of Nine), 18 th Degree (Knight Rose-Croix), 30 th Degree (Knight Kadosh), 32 nd Degree (Prince of the Royal Secret), 33 rd Degree (Sovereign Grand Inspector-General). The 66 th , 90 th and 95 th degrees were conferred as honorific titles on senior Masons, in recompense for their valor and fidelity. The other degrees (Secret Master, Royal Arch, etc) are optional and left to the discretion of the Brothers of higher degrees. Today, the Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm comprises around 5,500 Masons, the majority of laborers being located in South America. It possesses around a hundred Symbolic Lodges for the first three grades (not counting the higher echelons) in France,   6 After proclaiming himself Emperor, Napoleon’s Coat of Arms bore the Imperial Eagle."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, Australia, etc. Since the General Grand Mastership of Garibaldi, the position has been successively secured by Theodore Reuss (also Grand Master of the Grand-Orient of Germany ), Doctor Gérard Encausse ( Papus), Charles Détré (alias Teder), Jean Bricaud, Constant Chevillon, Charles-Henry Dupont, Robert Ambelain, and Gérard Kloppel since 1984. In 1964 a grand Convent-General of the Lodges of South America decided that the seat of the General Grand Mastership would be obligatorily in Paris, and a Convent-General of the Lodges of Europe ratified this vote in 1965. The Convent of South America also expressed the wish that the Grand Master-General should obligatorily be French. This appears to be more difficult to impose. Remembering its deaths (the Grand Master Chevillon was assassinated by the Vichy Militia, and his Belgian alter ego , Brother Delaive, was decapitated with a hatchet by the Nazis), this Rite perpetuates their tradition of fidelity to democratic principles and to the initiatic sciences. Uncompromisingly Deist, it makes the definition of “Masonic religion” laid out in Anderson’s Constitutions of 1723, and considered in “ general morality of honest men ” its own. Its Symbolic Lodges work the Templar Rite ( Mizraïm ) or the Egyptian Rite ( Memphis ), but on their altars they join the Ruler with the traditional interlacing of the Compass and Square . THE BÉDARRIDE BROTHERS Michel, Marc and Joseph Bédarride, one born in Avignon and the others in Cavaillon, all belonged to the Napoleonic army. Michel was superintendent of Vivres, Mark was a major, and Joseph captain of the train of artillery. Initiates of a field Lodge of the Italian army, Candor , Orient 7 of Cezena, they had very active Masonic careers. Marc in particular was the founder of many military Lodges, notably the 18 th of the Line, Rivals of Mars , of which he was the first Worshipful Master, the 12 th Division, Orient of La Rochelle, The Military Glory , then in Naples with Murat 8 , where they were guardsmen protecting buildings against looting, under the name of Children of Wisdom . On returning to France in 1813, they founded the French Obedience of Mizraïm , having received the requisite authority from Grand Commander De Lasselle in Naples. Then came the Restoration and the White Terror. The Bédarride brothers then lived in Paris on half pay, and in order to survive, albeit parsimoniously, tried their hand at commerce. Probably suspicious, keeping aloof, they became bankrupt. The famous police report of Simon Duplay, written in 1822, indicates that their activities extended over all parts of the realm; in Toulon a Bédarride is among “the most fanatical revolutionaries... ” ( sic ). They were everywhere, in Switzerland, in Belgium, founding Lodges under the Rite of Mizraïm , which the Duplay report classes among the constitutive secret societies of the Carbonari . The fact that all the Bédarride brothers had been Carbonari demonstrates the accuracy of the comment by Pierre Mariel, that is to say that the extravagance of the pretended origins of the Rite made Mizraïm “the most troubling enigma in French Masonry”, for, as Gaston Martin suggested: “One is allowed to wonder if this tissue of   7 Orient and East are usually interchangeable. However, the word ‘ Orient’ will be preserved where it occurs in a title, or refers to a Grand Jurisdiction: in the Lodge Room ‘ East’ will be used. 8 King of Naples (1808 – 15)."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 absurdities were not a pleasantry masking a very different objective. In fact, the Rite of Mizraïm recruited from among the most visible Masons of the Grand-Orient ... It seems that we were in the presence of a type of Masonry with secret goals, no doubt political 9 ... .”. Marc Bédarride died in 1846, and Michel in 1856. Brother Hayère succeeded him as the Head of the Rite. Today the Rite observes neutral politics and a complete adherence to religion. MARCONIS DE NÈGRE Gabriel-Mathieu Marconis, to which was added “De Nègre” in allusion to his dark complexion, was born in the 18 th Century, date unknown, and was one of the founders of the Rite of Memphis in France. He figured among the members of an esoteric group which, on May 23 rd 1815 in Montauban, constituted the Lodge named The Disciples of Memphis , the Mother-Lodge of the Rite. Already Grand Master of this Rite, he was elected Grand Master of the Rite of Mizraïm on January 21 st 1816. He was therefore one of the first unifying links between the two “Egyptian” Obediences. He held all the degrees of the old Rite of Perfection and all those of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite . From recent research one can conclude that he was also a member of the Ancient and Primitive Rite , which the father of the Marquis de Chefdebien d’Aigrefeuille had introduced into France following the war of the Austrian Succession. Because of this he would have been a member of the mysterious Chapters of Rose-Croix of the Grand Rosary 1 0 , where they studied Pneumatology 1 1 , Theurgy, etc. From these attachments he therefore appears to be a Mason who was deeply initiated into the secret sciences. His son, Jean- Étienne Marconis de Nègre, was born on January 3 rd 1795 and died in Paris on November 21st 1868. He was first elected Grand Master for France, then Grand Master- General of the Rite on July 7 th 1838. It was for him that a 96 th Degree was created, added to the preceding 95 degrees, called “Grand Hierophant”. He went to the United States in 1856, there constituting the American Obedience. Then he went to Egypt and established an Obedience of the same kind, under the name Grand-Orient of Egypt . The Marquis de Beauregard was its first Grand Master. NAPOLEON BONAPARTE From his accession to the imperial purple, Napoleon Bonaparte was always proclaimed and considered to be a genuine Freemason in his lifetime, as were his father, his brothers and his Marshals. In his book The Freemasonry of Bonaparte ( Payot edition 1982), François Collaveri showed the considerable role of Lodges in the diffusion of the great ideals of the French Revolution across Europe. “I am a man of the Revolution... ”, the Emperor had declared. In 1986 the same author assembled all the proofs of his personally belonging to the Masonic Order in a second volume : Napoleon, Emperor Freemason (Tallandier edition 1986).   9 Certainly supporters of Bonaparte. 1 0 Rose-Croix du Grand-Rosaire . 1 1 The Doctrine of the Holy Spirit."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 All the documents, with the very important witness of the archives of the Grand- Orient de France of former times, affirm that the initiation of Napoleon Bonaparte took place in Egypt. To those we can add the documentation published by us in Number 1 of the magazine L’Initiation in 1979, an article which included the recall of a letter of Grand Master Constant Chevillon, dated November 10 th 1934, confirming to Grand Master Fletcher of the USA that Napoleon Bonaparte had been received as a Mason in a Lodge in Cairo, which brought together the Masonic members of the Mission to Egypt, and that Kléber presided, the Lodge carrying the name Isis . These were the Masons, or their successors, who thereafter formally constituted the Rite of Memphis at Montauban in 1815. From this period, violet became the Masonic color of its rituals, blue being that of the Rite Français and blue edged with red that of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite . Violet constituted a reminder of the color of Parma violets, the duchy where the little king of Rome resided, then four years old. The Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm associated the violet of these origins with the turquoise blue attributed to great Isis in ancient Egypt, thus joining together a double esoteric symbolism. This is why Napoleon was one of the very first Masons of this Rite of Memphis . And the Emperor never forgot that he had “received light” on the antique soil of holy initiation. This is why he also adopted the Bee as a symbol of his reign, with the Eagle 1 2 . The bee was the image of Pharaoh in ancient Egypt, and two wings of an eagle flank the Osirian sun. Finally a comment by the Emperor to Josephine has been reported by one of her intimate friends, the celebrated Mlle Lenormand in her Memoirs : “I have consumed my life in continual movement which hasn’t allowed me to fulfill my duties as an initiate of the Egyptian sect”. (Cf. Mémoires historiques et secrets de l’Impératrice Joséphine , Paris 1920).

RITUAL OF AFFILILATION “A Mason is oblig’d by his Tenure, to obey the moral law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist nor an irreligious Libertine. But though in ancient Times Masons were charg’d in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet ‘tis now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all Men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves; that is, to be good Men and true, or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Persuasions they may be distinguish’d ; whereby Masonry becomes the Center of Union, and the Means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must have remain'd at a perpetual Distance.” (Cf. Anderson Constitutions, London 1723). The Lodge being duly assembled, the Works are opened on the First Degree, for the winning over of a Mason to a new Obedience must take him back to the precise moment where formerly he received Light and thus became a Freemason. Worshipful Master 1 3 : – Brother N... ., you have asked to be integrated into the particular Chain which constitutes our Obedience. Taking note of your request, the Masters of this Lodge have announced their verdict, and it is with sincere joy that our hands and yours are joined for evermore, drawing the fraternal bonds which Universal Masonry had already established between you and us a little closer.

This first chapter, also called The Obligations of a   1 3 The French refers to the Master as ‘Worshipful Master’ and the Wardens as ‘Wardens’. In this instance, as these are generic terms and not peculiar to these Rites, I have substituted the terms ‘Worshipful’ and Warden’ respectively. Where specific terms are used – for example ‘Assessors’ I have retained this. Naturally, anyone working these Rites should decide for themselves whether to use ‘Worshipful’ or ‘Worshipful’; ‘Warden’ or ‘Warden’."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Freemason , constitutes the beginning of the famous Anderson Constitutions , written in London in 1723 1 4 .

Worshipful Master : – As you have just heard, my Brother, it remains clear that our Obedience does not allow the imposition of any particular exoteric religious form upon a Profane or Mason desirous of coming among us. Nevertheless, while we reject all religious dogmatism, be it what it may, we immutably reject atheistic denial, and all sterile materialism. And it now becomes necessary, in the presence of this Worshipful Assembly of Masons, that you publicly manifest that to which you have previously given your assurance in this province. This is why I shall now ask you , in the name of all my Brothers and on my own behalf, to kindly reply “I believe this” to each of the three required questions of Traditional Freemasonry. Short silence.

Son of the Widow, do you believe this? Candidate : – I believe this, Worshipful Master. Worshipful Master : – Son of the Widow, considering that ancient Hermetic Tradition and modern Science teach that Life truly resides in the bosom of the three kingdoms of Nature: mineral, vegetable and animal, from the infinitely small to the infinitely large; and considering that it is highly probable that Nature equilibrates for the best the Universal Plan and its diverse finalities, in the face of fundamental manifestations, that it so harmonizes the progress of each of the three kingdoms, we believe that Man has a duty towards Nature, towards all living beings, and that it is for him to prove himself to be its intelligent protector.

RITUAL OF THE MASONIC TRIANGLE The Constitution of the G RAND L ODGE OF M EMPHIS -M IZRAÏM includes a section dedicated to Masonic Triangles. Here is the text, which defines their purpose, formation, rights and duties. Purpose – The Triangle is a Masonic structure which allows Brothers of an insufficient number to form a regular Lodge, and living in a place far from any regular Lodge, to meet. The purposes of Triangles are: 1) To maintain those relations, concord, ties of solidarity and mutual aid which should exist among all Masons, between Brothers isolated in an Orient far from a regular Lodge; 2) Through study, example and action, particularly in planning in concert by all legal means, to promote the growth of Freemasonry and its principles in general, and M EMPHIS -M IZRAÏM Masonry in particular; 3) To bring about the creation of a Symbolic Lodge in centers where they meet. Formation – The formation of a Triangle requires the presence of at least three regular Masons, of whom one at least shall hold the grade of Master, regardless of the Obedience in which he has received it. When three Masons have determined t o create a Triangle, they must address a request signed by all of them to the Federal Council of the G RANDE L OGE F RANÇAISE DE M EMPHIS -M IZRAÏM . The Triangle can comprise three to six members. If more than four, it takes the name of Just Lodge 1 6 . Rights of Triangles – Triangles can make any resolution or take any decision leading to the objectives started below, notably: a) to conduct studies for the education of Brothers or profanes; b) to create or propagate any work likely to make know or promote Freemasonry in general and the R ITE OF M EMPHIS -M IZRAÏM in particular, or to aid in its development; c) to collect subscriptions destined to meet their own expenses, either for the relief of the unfortunate, or for Masonic works or institutions.   1 6 Juste could also be translated as ‘ Righteous’, ‘Equitable’, ‘Proper’, ‘Apt’, ‘True’, ‘Exact’, ‘Precise’."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 Duties of Triangles – Once the aforesaid Triangle has received the Patent of Constitution, it must place itself in relations with the nearest G RAND L ODGE to the place at which it meets. They will need to provide this Body with: a) the names, professions, Lodges and grades of the Masons comprising the Triangle; b) the Agenda and Minutes of each meeting; c) the dates and times of meetings of the Triangle, as well as the reasons given by absent Brothers. Functioning – The Work of Masonic Triangles must be sheltered from any indiscretion, in a completely exclusive place, where no profane may be able to penetrate during the Work in question. The Work should utilize an appropriate Ritual. At the first meeting, a Master-Warden shall be elected, and a Secretary who is charged with recording all documents and activities, and a Treasurer-Hospitaller. The term of their office is one year maximum, and they are eligible for reelection each year in the Fall. Brothers belonging to regular Masonic Obediences can participate in the Works under the title of visitors, but they cannot be elected to one of the three Offices of the aforesaid Triangle, unless they are already affiliated with a Lodge of the G RANDE L OGE F RANÇAISE DE M EMPHIS -M IZRAÏM . Triangles have a requirement to meet at least once a month. Decoration – Members of a Triangle must wear the Masonic Apron of their grade, soberly dressed with a black tie, white or light shirt, and white gloves. They may wear the insignia of their Office on a Collar of turquoise moiré, in conformity with the Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm, lined with black. The insignias are: – Master-Warden: a Square at 90 o – Brother Secretary: two crossed Goose Feathers – Brother Treasurer: an embossed Key or two crossed Keys These Jewels of the Order are in gilded metal. Temple – The Triangle Members meet around a Table covered with a linen broadcloth Cover or Tablecloth in blue. They sit in a triangle around the Table. The Master-Warden is armed with a gavel. Upon the Table, in front of him, is the Sacred Book. Upon the Book are the Square and Compasses laid out as for the First Degree, and upon these two jewels is a Sword, with a flaming blade if possible."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Each of the three Members of the Triangle has a lit Candle before him. The Master-Warden also has a copy of the Ritual. The Secretary has the Register of Protocol, and the Treasurer the Book of Accounts, and both of them the Ritual appropriate to their Office. It is desirable to have a censer with glowing coals placed in the center of the Table, before the Sacred Book. In this case, the Brother Master-Warden will also have an Incense Boat containing a mixture of Frankincense and Benzoin. The doors must be closed, and windows should have the curtains drawn. Advancement 1 7 – Initiations – a Triangle composed of a Master and two Apprentices can receive a Profane into the First Degree (Apprentice). A Triangle composed of a Master and two Companions can receive a Profane in the First Degree (Apprentice) and then elevate him to the Second Degree (Companion). A Triangle composed of three Masters can receive him into all three Degrees: but each reception firstly requires a dispensation from the Grand Master. In principle, any Initiation and all Receptions into a higher Degree should take place in the Lodge of the Rite nearest to the place where the Triangle meets. In the worst case, they may take place in a Lodge of another Obedience, and the recipient is subsequently affiliated to the G RANDE L OGE F RANÇAISE DE M EMPHIS -M IZRAÏM . OPENING OF THE WORKS The Brothers who are members of the Triangle are seated in their places, the Master-Warden in the East, the Brother Secretary in the North, the Brother Treasurer in the South.

CEREMONY OF FOUNDATION OF A MASONIC LODGE RITUAL SACRED CALENDAR Classical Masonic Tradition measures its Sacred Chronology from Year One of the Creation of the World, according to Genesis and Judeo-Christian calculations. It is simply by adding 4,000 years to our Christian era 2 1 . Thus we say 1965 C.E. (Common Era). The Latin vulgaris or vulgo 2 2 signifying public, common to all, has in it nothing offensive for Christian chronology. But one also says 5965 (meaning “from the Creation of the World”).

In other countries local Triangles may consider requiring local police records or references to insure the integrity and lack or police record of the postulant. 2 1 Bishop Ussher, Primate of All Ireland, incorporated his calculation – that the world was created on Sunday 23 October 4004 B.C. – into a Bible printed in 1701. For Masons it is simpler to add 4000 years rather than 4004 years to be present date. 2 2 In Latin Common Era is anno vulgaris ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25 action, in the course of which Universes succeeded Universes, Creations succeeded Creations, this Tradition generally uses the following chronological transcription: “000.000.000 th Year of T !

The nine zeros then signify that it is E TERNAL L IGHT which acts, since the zero is the symbol which allows any number to multiply itself to infinity. Another Tradition specific to the R ITE OF M EMPHIS -M IZRAÏM takes its chronology from 1292 BCE, the year in which R AMESES II, the first great king of the XX th Dynasty and last of the grandiose Pharaohs, creator of the famous Temples at Abu Simbel, ascended to the throne of Egypt. Nearly half the Egyptian sanctuaries which still inspire our admiration date form his glorious reign. He left a legend so universal and impressive of the qualities of a superman that his successors devoted themselves in trying to be his dull reflection. A King-Magician, he had the power to make it rain or to cause drought, and that at a distance. A Protector of the Arts, he knew how to collect and protect the ancient treasures of his realm. An excellent Strategist, he compelled respect and fear of holy Egypt upon his turbulent neighbors. In this second Chronology, the year 1965 is thus Year 3257. Here are the names of the Egyptian months 2 3 : Season of Akhet 2 4 (Inundation): FALL, start of the Sacred Year ( Convents ) First month THOTH begins August 29 th Second month PHAOPHI begins September 29 th Third month ATHYR begins October 28 th Fourth month CHOIAK begins November 27 th Season of Peret (Emergence): WINTER Fifth month TYBI begins December 27 th Sixth month MECHIR begins January 26 th Seventh month PHAMENOTH begins February 25 th Eighth month PHARMUTHI begins March 27 th Season of Shenu (Low Water): SPRING Ninth month PACHON begins April 26 th Tenth month PAYNI begins May 26 th Eleventh month EPIPHI begins June 25 th Twelfth month MESORI begins July 25 th This twelfth and final Egyptian month thus ends on August 23 rd , leaving a void of five days before the first day of the month of THOTH (August 29 th ). These are the Five   2 3 The Seasonal names given by R. Ambelain are Schâ , Pré and Schemon . I could find no reference to these names anywhere so have substituted the most commonly used words for the seasons. 2 4 In R.

All these Delegations were saluted by the Most Serene Grand Master who took care to underline all the secular ties which unite our R ITE with the Grand-Orient de France (accords of 1806 and 1863), and with the Grande Loge Écossaise , later called the Grande Loge de France (accord of 1880). He then proceeded to give a brief exposition of the history and origins of our R ITE , coming from the Rite of Mizraïm (created in Venice in 1788), associated with the Primitive Rite (1779), then, and through Garibaldi, united with the Rite of Memphis (1815). He recalled that this latter, founded by the scholars who participated in the Egyptian Campaign, and all members of the old initiatic Obediences of the Philalethes , the Philadelphians and the Hermetic Rite ( Illuminati of Avignon ), had been based on the   2 5 Taken from the creation of an actual Lodge in Rue La Condamine, Paris. 2 6 Very Worshipful Brother (lit.

Gérard de Nerval, in his Voyage en Orient 2 8 , showed that there existed ancient traditions and a secret society among the Druzes, coming from the Medieval Trade Guild which had accompanied the Crusades, and were later associated with the Temple . Also, the role played by the Khalif Hakem in the maintenance of Gnostico-Egyptian traditions, which were still very much alive in Cairo. And so the Rite of Memphis , thanks to Gaspard Monge, Larret, etc, was truly brought forth from these remnants of Ancient Egyptian Mysteries at the bosom of Druze Masonry. If we were to doubt this, we had only to remember that the Bibliothèque Nationale possesses Gnostic manuscripts written as late as the 12 th Century in Damas. Finally, it was not without reason that Masons who constitute the Rite of Memphis choose for their Lodges and Chapters such names as The Reunited Druzes or Knights of Lebanon , nor that one of the high grades of the Rite carries the title of Sublime Day , which is one of the secret grades of initiated Druzes. The Most Serene Grand Master ended by thanking the Representatives of friendly Obediences who had kindly desired to have themselves represented by some of their high dignitaries: the Grande Loge de France , the Grand-Orient de France , the Grand Lodge d’Italie , the Grand Lodge Féminine de France . He mentioned that our R ITE has an accord with the Grande Loge Nationale Française “ Opéra ”, and that the Grand Loge Nationale Française “Neuilly” , if it cannot recognize our Symbolic Grand Lodge, at least recognizes our high grades, since some of its high dignitaries are also ours. Then, with the extensive and numerous assistance of the Brothers and Sisters who filled to overflowing the Great Temple in the Rue La Condamine, came the Ceremony of Constitution of the “Pavement” of the Temple, with the assistance of the Egyptian Cord and the Sacred Triangle.

The Works were now Closed in the Third and second Degrees. The Brothers Grand Master of Ceremonies and Grand Hospitaller circulated the Box of Beneficence and the Bag of Propositions.

They cannot occupy any position. And in the Masculine Grand Lodge of the Rite, Sisters are absolutely not allowed to attend. From this one may see that it is only the Rite itself which unites the Feminine Obedience and the Masculine Obedience.

My Brothers, please be seated. We will now proceed with the Installation of the Worthy Master and his Officers. N OTE : – The phylacteries (from the Greek phulattein : to preserve, to keep) are the ribbons of moiré or silk of turquoise color, 10 to 12 cm wide, and at long as the future diagonal of the Egyptian Triangle, which are intended to at the time of the drawing of the Pavement . One of them bears the sixteen essential hieroglyphs of Ancient Egypt, the second bears the sixteen equivalent demotic characters. The first are drawn in red and the second are drawn in black. The Egyptian Triangle is made of three small cords of white cotton or nylon in the same color, joined by rings of plastic or celluloid material, or even better, ivory, 3 to 4 cm in diameter, to which they are attached with simple knots. The Egyptian Triangle is necessarily made to the dimensions of the future Pavement. Its base is 3, its height 4 and its diagonal 5. Its esotericism is described in La Symbolique des Outils 3 2 (ed. EDIMAF, 16 rue Cadet, Paris). The Chalk used to draw the Pavement is blue or green, preferably white. All other color is proscribed. The drawing of the characters on the phylacteries will preferably be reserved to a Mason knowledgeable in design or calligraphy, in order to avoid clumsy deformations. In Obediences where the phylacteries will be frequently used, it would be a good idea to adorn the first one with gold braid on top, with a gold fringe at the bottom. The second one can be similarly adorned in silver. They are then carried and used by the Grand Installing Officers, and returned each time to the offices of the Obedience, in a protective bag along with the Egyptian Cord . The whole Ritual of Installation of a new Lodge is moreover inspired by that of founding the Temples of Egypt by the reigning Pharaoh, Supreme Pontiff and “Vehicle” for Osiris.   3 2 “The Symbolism of the Tools”."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39 5.

Grand Master : – From time immemorial, my Brother, it has been established by virtue of secular custom among Freemasons for each Lodge, once in every year at a stated period, to select from among those who have been noted by their Brother as the most capable, an experienced Brother to preside over the Lodge in the capacity of Worthy Master. He must initially have been elected at the time of the foundation of the Lodge, through the direct choice of the Grand Master, by the Federal Council, or by the direct choice of the future members of the Lodge which assure its succession. My Brother N... .., you have been so led to this charge by the play of our Institutions.

Secondly, he must have been regularly initiated, passed and raised in the three established Grades of Egyptian Masonry, be well-skilled in our Architectural Art and in its mysteries, and have always been assiduous in his Work. Thirdly, he ought to be exemplary in conduct in Lodge, courteous and affable of manners, easy of address, firm and inflexible in the principles and traditions of Freemasonry, equitable and just in judging human weakness, well versed in our traditions and usages.

RITUAL OF THE FIRST DEGREE • Opening of the Works • Reception of an Apprentice • Closing of the Works OBSERVATIONS A Masonic Temple should be completely hung in blue, strewn with golden stars on the normally vaulted ceiling. In the East is the magisterial Chair, in the middle of a dais of three steps, flanked by the pedestals of the Secretary and Orator. At the base of the dais, in front of these Officers, are the pedestals of the Treasurer and Hospitaller, flanked by the seats reserved for the Expert and Master of Ceremonies. In the West, before the two Columns “J” and “B”, are the pedestals of the Senior and Junior Wardens. Between them but a little behind, is the Tiler, in front of the two leaves of the door. He communicates with the Guardian of the Threshold, who is seated in the Parvis, through a peep-hole made in one of the doors. All the Officers have a Masonic sword carried in hand, the Master of Ceremonies alone having an ebony cane with ivory pommel. The Worshipful Master and Wardens also have Gavels. These customs are common to all Rites and all Masonic Obediences. LODGE TRACING BOARDS When Speculative Freemasonry began, Lodge members did not possess Temples laid out and decorated for their ritual assemblies. These took place in a large saloon or hall, the home of one of the members, or a bar endowed with all the required equipment. As a result it was necessary to draw the Pavement with a piece of chalk on the floor of the room, without which no ritual meeting would be valid. There they enacted an evocatory Rite of the Masonic Spirit, Elias Artista of Rosicrucian tradition; his true name in Hebrew is known in Chapters of the 18 th Degree, and signifies “Prodigious Founder of the Strong God”. He is Tubalcain, mentioned in Genesis , IV, 22. After the meeting, during the Closing Ceremony, the drawing of the Pavement was effaced. The use of a rectangle (baptized Pavement) was borrowed from ancient grimoires, which used it in preference to the traditional magic circle. Later, it was found more logical to have this Mosaic Pavement painted on a thick cloth stretched between two rollers, now ornamented with Masonic emblems proper to"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45 Figure 1 – First Degree Tracing Board"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 the Degree being practiced 3 3 . It was then enough to unroll it soon after the ritual Opening of the Works, and to roll it up again afterwards. Of course it is on the Mosaic Pavement, upon the alternating black and white squares, that one unrolls the Lodge Tracing Boards. But in the Rite of Memphis , they are not used, having regard to the small central Altar erected in the middle, and which absolutely must not be moved , since the Lights or central lamp are supposed never to be extinguished. All these traditions constitute the occult spirit of the whole Masonic Order. Nowadays it is the same with this as with the Catholic Church: the efficacious character of these Rites is lost because men do not understand them. ABRIDGED RITUAL 3 4 (from the Manuscripts of 1824) TEMPLE LAYOUT The temple is laid our as all other Masonic Lodges. Still, behind the Worshipful Master, a painted Picture represents a Door of Ivory and Gold, closed, with no visible lock, framed by two Columns in Egyptian style, terminating with the djed , or “occult pillar of Osiris”. Between the Columns is stretched a turquoise blue transparent Veil, masking a part of the Door. Above is the Delta, with a Point in its center. At the center of the room is a large rectangle paved with one hundred and eight black and white squares. On this rectangle, in the corners, are three Columns about one meter high, laid out in a square, one towards the East, two at the base towards the west. On each of them is a Candlestick 3 5 allowing one, two or three Lights of the Order to be carried, being three, six or nine in total. In the middle of the Mosaic Pavement is a small triangular Altar representing a fragment of the Obelisk on which are laid out the Square and Compasses according to the Degree being worked. Over both is the Ruler. The base of the triangular Altar faces the East, the point towards the West. In the middle of the base, on the axis of the Sacred Tools, is a Candlestick and lit Candle. At the point of the triangular Altar is a Censer containing burning charcoal, and the Incense Boat. The Officers’ Pedestals are draped in turquoise blue, edged with violet. A three- branched Candelabra is on the Worshipful Master’s Pedestal, and a single Candlestick on those of each of the Wardens and on that of the Secretary. The Apprentices are seated at the Column “J” in accordance with the French Rite.   3 3 R. Ambelain appears a little confused: the Mosaic Pavement would be the carpet with alternating black and white squares, with a rope border bearing the embroidered lake of love knots. It is the Tracing Boards which change for each Degree and bear the appropriate Masonic symbols of the Degree. 3 4 Modified in conformity with the decisions of the Convent of 1969 C.E. 3 5 This implies the Candlesticks are three-branched Candelabras."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47 The Members of the Lodge who are Apprentices and Companions wear a white Apron, the latter with the flap turned down, and their waistband may be violet.

The Honorary Past Masters wear the same, as do the Past Masters, but the Sash is edged with a gold ribbon ten millimeters wide. The Jewels are gilded.

Above is the Delta, with a point in its center. In the center of the room is a large rectangle of black and white flags of 108 Squares. On this rectangle, in the corners, three Columns, disposed in a set square, the base towards the West, with a Light on each of them, allowing the use of three, six or nine lights of the Order. In the middle of this Rectangle is a small triangular Altar representing a fragment of an Obelisk, on which rests the Book of Wisdom, a Candle and a Censer. Also a small votive light serves to light the others. The Officers’ Pedestals are draped in sky blue (or turquoise blue), edged with violet. A three-branched Candlestick is on the Worshipful Master’s Pedestal, and a single candlestick on those of the Wardens. The Apprentices are seated on Column “J”, as in the Rite Français. The Masters wear a sky blue or turquoise Apron, with a white base, as in the Rite Français, decorated with three sky blue or turquoise rosettes 4 3 .

RECEPTION INTO THE GRADE OF APPRENTICE Following the traditional preliminary inquiry by three Brothers, if the Lodge is in agreement, the Candidate is first summoned outside of a regular Meeting, to submit to the customary Interrogation under the blindfold. The Masters will ask him such questions as they judge useful, and capable of allowing the Candidate clearly to manifest his opinions regarding religion, metaphysics, philosophy and politics. This interrogation should always be conducted with the highest standard of courtesy, and one should use that tone of perfect tolerance which should reign in the heart of a well-conducted Masonic Lodge, regarding the pronouncements of the Profane. When the Interrogation is over, and the Candidate conducted back to the Parvis, the Masters will proceed, by secret ballot, to decide on the reception or refusal of the candidacy of the aforementioned Profane. If he is accepted, the Lodge Secretary will summon him to a later Meeting, during which the ceremony of Reception will take place. But first, he must give his word to keep silent on all he has seen or heard. * * * The ceremony of Reception will always be preceded by the solemn Opening of the Works, and followed by their Closing. The Lodge being open, the Worshipful Master invited the Brother Expert 4 6 to being the Ritual of Reception. * * * The Expert then takes possession of the Candidate in the Parvis, carefully binds his eyes and leads him to the Chamber of Reflection. He has him sit before a table, sparingly furnished with a real human Skull; a lit wax Candle, half-consumed,; a sheet of white paper, pen and ink. The seat is a stool without a back.

Expert : – Sir, alone, left to yourself, before an image of termination of terrestrial Life, I invite you to write your Philosophical Testament. The Ceremony which you are about to undergo will, through its esoteric symbolism, bring to life the process, following death , of separation of the constitutive elements of Being. So that you will truly absorb the real purpose of Masonic Initiation, we ask you to meditate upon three metaphysical terms which dominate the entire question of human existence. This is why I invite you, in this place and at this time, to set down your conception of the main elements of the duties of Man towards God, the World, and himself. When you are alone, with this door once more closed, then only are you permitted to remove your blindfold. When the Candidate has removed his blindfold, he finds the following text and three questions upon the table, which he must answer in writing: 1) Considering that Philosophy leads us to conceive, and observation to admit, the probable existence of an Intelligence at work in all the Universe, an Intelligence whose elementary light is probably the first tangible manifestation, and the creative and organizing agent of Universal Matter; and considering that this Universal Intelligence orders and leads this Universe towards and end whose distant perspectives pass the feeble intelligence of man, what, in your opinion, are the duties which Man owes to this Intelligence, which human religions call God, the Pythagoreans identified by the name “God who Geometrizes”, and which, in the same manner, Freemasons call “The Grand Architect of the Universe”. 2) Considering that ancient Hermetic Tradition and modern Science teach that life resides very truly within the three kingdoms of Nature: mineral, vegetable and animal, from the infinitely small to the infinitely large; and considering that it is highly probable that Nature perfectly balances the Universal Plan and through its great diversity the appearance of its vital manifestations, what, in your opinion, are the duties which Man owes to the Universe? 3) Considering that is equally highly probable that Man placed upon this orb is, through his intelligence, his reason, and through his undeniable material potentials, the reflection of this Universal Intelligence at work in all the Universe; and considering equally that each human individuality is, ultimately and likewise, but a lesser reflection of the total human collectivity, called Humanity, what, in your opinion, are the duties which Man owes firstly towards himself, and towards Humanity?"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 The Expert leaves the Chamber of Reflection, closes the door and returns to the Lodge to give an account to the Worshipful Master . After a period of time, the Expert returns to fetch the Profane . For this he wears his apron and collar and carries his sword. Having blindfolded the Candidate once more, he divests him of all metallic substances, and clothes him according to the Ritual of 1786, being: bareheaded, blindfolded, in shirtsleeves, left arm and breast bare, without garters, right knee bare, left foot “slipshod”, that is to say, shoe half off, and around his neck the Expert will run a cabletow, by which he gently leads him. Expert : – Sir, to be initiated was “to learn to die” in the Ancient World. The cord which you are now wearing about your neck should not be seen by you to be a humiliation or a punishment. It is certainly not for the purpose of a meaningless hazing. This symbolic cord is none other than the image of the fluidic chain which linked your subtle body to the carnal envelope of which material Death has deprived you. Leaving the Chamber of Reflection and its funereal furniture, you are now crossing – as if in a dark dream – somber Amenti , Hades , the Realm of the Dead. Guided by the subterranean Hermes, conductor of souls to the Hereafter, you are blindly led towards the ineffable Light, and this under its only guide. May it help you to penetrate the esoteric teachings of our Ritual: for without providential intervention, without some occult and mysterious predestination, there is little chance for the human soul, living in darkness, to find once again the path to his original Liberty. Such is the formal teaching of Gnosis. Having taken the Philosophical Testament of the Candidate , he folds it into a triangle, places it on the point of his sword and takes it to the Worshipful Master . He returns to fetch the Candidate . The Expert then leads him gently towards the door of the Lodge. Arriving before the entrance, he asks the Neophyte to knock on the door several times. WM : – Who knocks at the door of the Temple as a Profane? Expert : – It is indeed a Profane, who asks to be received as a Mason. WM : – How does he dare to hope for this? Expert : – Being free born and of good morals. WM : – In that case, let him enter, but for prudence I invite this worthy Assembly to observe the usual discretionary measures. Those present wear black masks and take hold of their swords. The Brother Tiler opens both leaves of the door of the Temple, and the Expert , addressing the Candidate , says:"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63 Expert : – Sir, bow your head and bend your body before this threshold, for this door is very low. The Neophyte is introduced, bent double, into the Lodge, and he is assisted to sit on a stool in front of the two Columns “J” and “B”, facing the East. WM : – Sir, the secular Fraternity with which you have asked to be affiliated has shown confidence in you up till now. But before allowing you to undergo the next part of the Ritual of Reception, I ask you, in the name of all the Brothers here present and in my name also, to solemnly reiterate your first vow of Silence. Do you swear that whatever happens, whether this Ceremony be interrupted or runs its course, you will reveal nothing to anyone, not even to a close relative, nor to a confessor, not even to a brother or spouse, of what you are going to see or hear, do or undergo. Can.: – I so swear. WM : – Sir, Freemasonry, heir of ancient esoteric and occult meeting chambers, has preserved the secret of a very ancient drink, a true philter, composed of plants gathered at precise lunar periods, worked and infused with certain others, and finally consecrated according to millenary Rites. This beverage has the effect of depersonalizing you. A few weeks after its ingestion, while in no way affecting physical health, your past personality will slowly dissolve. Gradually, over time, you will become another being. Slowly, but surely, the Egregore which quickens and leads our ancient Society will penetrate you, substitute its will for yours and, at the anniversary of your Reception, nothing of the man who you presently are will remain. Then you will no longer be, in the words of an ancient and very occult formula: “similar to the corpse that the hand of the washer of the dead 4 7 turns and turns again as he wills”. One last time, Sir, do you consent to die to your past life? Can.: – I consent. W M : – So be it. Brother Expert, cause the Neophyte to partake of the Cup of Forgetfulness. The Expert then places in the left hand of the Candidate a Cup containing the aforementioned drink. The Candidate slowly drinks the contents. Once done, the Expert takes the Cup from him. WM : – Sir, I congratulate you on your courage. However, know that the proofs which await you, while symbolic, are paralleled on more subtle “planes” where they have an immediate and lasting realization. It is not to your physical courage that I appeal, but to your moral audacity. There are thresholds which, once crossed, no longer permit you to turn back. According to the popular adage: “Only the first step is costly... ”. But you are   4 7 Laveur des morts."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 still ignorant of what the cost will be! Once more, Sir, before continuing to “live” this Ceremony, I ask you to reflect. Do you consent? Can.: – I do. WM : – In that case, Brother Expert, have the Neophyte make his first Journey. The Worshipful Master give a blow with his Gavel. The Expert then takes the Candidate and says to him: Expert : – My son, come with me... Tumult breaks out in the Lodge. The Brothers make a noise with the blades of their Swords, and imitate the sound of thunder with their feet. The Expert conducts the Candidate from the Columns in the West, passing to the South, the East and arrives at the North. During the Journey the Brothers jostle and harass the Neophyte as he passes, and the Expert turns him about from time to time with jerks and jolts. On arriving at the North, he stops before the Junior Warden , who rises and pushes the Candidate roughly, his Gavel pressed against his breast, saying: JW: – Who goes there? Expert : – A Profane who asks to be received as a Mason. JW: – How do he dare to hope for this? Expert : – Being free born and of good morals. JW: – In that case let him pass, and let him be purified by Water . The Brother Master of Ceremonies seizes the right hand of the Recipient and plunges it into a vase filled with pure water; he then wipes the Candidate’s hand, and the Expert leads him to his seat between the two Columns. WM : – Sir, what esoteric teaching do you believe can be drawn from this first symbolic Journey? Can.: – ... WM : – Sir, once again I say to you that all Masonic Ceremony is paralleled in the more subtle planes, in an occult realization. The Journey you have just made, following your departure from the Chamber of Reflection, is symbolic of your first post-mortem contact"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"65 with their spiritual regions immediately above the physical plane. The tumult, the various obstacles which impeded your progress are but the image of the difficulties of every kind which are arrayed against attempts by the human soul to liberate itself from the shadow of materialism and lower passions. Similarly, it is a living representation of the prejudice, erroneous beliefs, and the blind yet tenacious hatred which rise up before any attempt to raise up the Mystic Temple , considered to be the symbol of all Humanity or simply one of its participants. Thanks to your mystical protection, you finally passed through the first “Door”, and the Archon who guards it gave you entrance, once you had submitted to the first necessary purification, that of Water. You are now Mundus . Other proofs, physical or moral, await you on the Second Journey. Do you believe yourself to be sufficiently strong to confront them, and to regret nothing which may be inflicted on you? Candidate – ...

The Expert gently guides the Candidate .

Then the Expert leads him to his place between the Columns. W M : – Sir, what esoteric teaching do you believe can be drawn from this second symbolic Journey? Can.: – ...   4 8 Although obstacles were not explicitly mentioned in the first Journey, one may assume they refer to items similar to the ‘rocky road’ of York Rite Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 WM : – Sir, this Journey continues the series of natural purifications to which the human Soul submits in its ascent towards the Divine. Casting off the successive subtle envelopes which robe this divine spark which we call the Soul, you have arrived at the middle region, the intermediate realm, where the heaviness of sensual passions, symbolized by Water , are already forgotten, but where live those of intellectual beliefs, symbolized by Air . If the needs of the flesh are things which are finally dead for you, the passions of the spirit remain, imperious and unreasonable. Now, to become a Sage, Sir, know that nothing must remain of all which deceives us here below. No contingency merits man, often voluntarily, becoming its subject. No belief, no opinion sufficiently approaches Total Truth to merit a similar slavery. And it is here that we must return to the affirmation of one of our Brothers, called Goethe, who tells us that: “Nothing past merits being revived; the New Eternal is only created out of the developed elements of the Old, and true and pure burning desire must ever be productive, in order to arrive at new and better things”. This simple phrase, sums up Masonry which, on the path to luminous becoming, for many centuries has shown us the way to ideal Beauty. Your route, Sir, is still long. Other proofs, as I have told you, still await. Do you agree to make the third Journey? Can.: – ... WM : – In that case, Brother Expert, have the Neophyte make his third Journey...

The Baptism of Water made you mundus , or washed. Fire has made you purus , or purified. Water may purify the body of flesh, but for the purification of the Double, the intermediary mediator between the corporeal Form and the Spirit, only Air , the median element in the universal energetic quarter, is able to accomplish this. Now it belongs to Fire alone, the superior, occult and divine element, to accomplish that of the Soul, the divined principle which animates you, that imperishable reality of Being. Your Journey was made without any obstacle, so that nothing might trouble the inner silence of your Being. This is because you have now arrived in those spiritual realms where all is Beauty, Wisdom and Harmony. In a plane where you are still blind, in spite of everything, you can yet sense the imminent splendor of the Light close by. Two final proofs await you. They are perhaps more dangerous than those to which you have submitted, and are required to prove to us your sincerity and your future devotion to our Order. This is what they are. Sir, it is a tradition of ours to mark our new Brothers with a Seal of hot iron, upon the left arm. The esoteric design made by this Seal is both a discreet mark imprinted on your flesh and a required signature which you deposit in the heart of the Invisible Realm.

The solemn Obligation which you are now going to take, written on vellum according to custom must, in order to be able to be projected by Fire into the heart of the Invisible, be signed with your own blood. All Pacts, whether infernal or divine, have always been thus. Do you accept the necessary wound which must be inflicted upon your Flesh, and which to us will at the same time be the esoteric engagement that, if required on a future date, you will not hesitate to shed it, voluntarily and happily, for the defense of all Masonry?

Ranged in a semicircle about his, facing the Western Door, the other Brothers , masked in black, swords in hand, point their arms towards the Neophyte which the Expert has just led in. Two torches alone illuminate the Lodge, either side of the “cadaver”. The Recipient’s blindfold is removed. 5 0 W M : – Sir, you see here the deadly fate which belongs to perjurers, traitors and profaners. If you have intended to penetrate our Order with such a hidden motive, we urge you to reflect immediately on the gravity of the Obligation which you are about to take, without any possible mental restriction. Even if your Brothers pardon you, the ritual malediction, launched beforehand against you, and by you yourself , will most surely put into action the Fatal Forces; and Misfortune, Misery, Dishonor and a violent Death would be the sad milestones of your earthly life. Once again, Sir, reflect upon the gravity of your Obligation. Brother Expert, reconduct the Neophyte to the Chamber of Reflection. The Expert leads the Candidate to the Chamber of Reflection.

A short time ago you drank the Cup of Forgetfulness , intended to depersonalize you, and remove your free will. Here is a second Cup, that of the Drink of Memory , the Water of Mnemosyne... When you absorb this, you will be completely possessed. The occult Spirit of Masonry will pass completely into you. And wherever you are in the World, you will always be one with all your Brothers, and their likes and dislikes will be yours. Just as the Cup of Forgetfulness made of you’re a dead body, without free will, so the Water of Memory will make of you a militant Mason, the true Son of the Widow.

WM : – Brother Junior Warden, what should we understand by this word “Worship”? Does it refer to a new religion? SW : – Worshipful Master, the word ‘religion’ comes from the Latin religio signifying integrity, duty, and conscience. Such is the religion of a Mason.   5 5 In the French text the word “ Culte ” is used. This is a common French word for group of worshipers.

However, the reason I raise this question is because we are not accustomed to having independent Minutes for Fellowcraft (or Companion) Lodges, since according to tradition either Apprentices are not present hear minutes in general (e.g. USA); or the minutes are heard by Apprentices, but simply refer to the fact that a Degree was given and the participants (e.g. UK) without giving details. 6 1 The use of ‘Cartouches’ is unusual.

DISCOURSE OF THE WORSHIPFUL MASTER From the most distant ages, from the Constructors of the Pyramids to the Builders of the Cathedrals, passing by the Tyrian and Judaic Corporations, the Greco-Roman Collegia, the Medieval Confraternities and the Operative Masons have, at all times been led by mysterious philosophies, which entrusted them with the task of conveying – consciously or unconsciously – the essence of a precise initiatory technique. Long before giving birth to Speculative Masonry, its contemporary elder Sister, Operative Masonry, had from the Middle Ages created a symbolic language, with images full of substance, so"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83 that free thought, jealously guarded in the minds of the elite, might not run the risk of being diluted 6 2 . The subtle feelers which the human spirit sometimes launches into the mysterious world of Archetypes and Universals often harness concepts whose fleeting images remain only with difficulty in the consciousness of Man unless, like bridges stretched between flesh and spirit, Symbols are allowed to conceive, represent and translate them. We know the singular phenomenon by which Man imprints upon an object or being in the world which surrounds us, a psychic tenor or tonality which is in reality a trait of his own inner life. The philosophers gave this the name “projection”, and they considered it complemented by “perception”, that is to say, completed through the contribution of the classic sense. Now, all initiatory techniques in Speculative Freemasonry rest upon these two notions. It uses the Symbolism, sublimated to a maximum in each of their analogical correspondences across the planes, of the Nine Tools , three of which are attributed to each of the three traditional Degrees: Apprentice, Companion, Master. The practice of true alchemy, both intellectual and moral, applied with perseverance, is alone capable of transforming the spark placed within you at the time of your Reception as an Apprentice, into a real “inner light”, where Knowledge and Reason will collaborate and mutually work together. The Nine Tools are the concrete and very recondite images of the nine senses, of which you still only know of the initial five. These images are moreover symbols of the virtues, the powers, the natural potential inherent in every human being. Only putting them into rational action will make of you a true initiate. Finally, these Nine Tools are also symbols of the nine essential forces at work in the Universe, the nine Demiurges who serves the Supreme Architect in ordering and perfecting His Work. During your Reception as an Apprentice, you made a certain number of symbolic “Journeys” and after each submitted to a “purification” connected to the corresponding Element. As a form of Baptism, you were at the same time washed clean of faults pertaining to this Element, freed of the inferior and weighty manifestations of your psyche in its analogical “correspondences”, and endowed with superior potential regarding your spirit. On the first “Journey”, leaving the Chamber of Reflection, crossing Earth , you were in principle purified of your past Avarice ; and we tried to awaken the virtue of Prudence within you, counseled you to Silence ; and we tried to arouse in you the power of Counsel and the gift of Interpretation . On the second “Journey”, among tumult and obstacles, crossing Water , you have been purified in principle of your past Gluttony . We tried to awaken the virtue of   6 2 ‘prostituted’ in the original text."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 Temperance within you; counseled you to Solitude through Silence ; and we tried to arouse in you the power of Fear and the gift of Tongues or Glossolalia . On the third “Journey”, in the contrast of a hostile silence sown with traps and pitfalls, crossing the Element of Air , you were purified of your past Lechery . We tried to awaken the virtue of Justice within you; counseled you to a moderation of Appetites ; and we tried to arouse in you the sense of Masonic Duty , equivalent to Piety among the Profane, and the gift of Discerning Spirits , which is but Psychology . On the fourth “Journey”, in a silence without material obstacles, crossing the Element of Fire , you were purified of your past Indolence . We tried to awaken the virtue of Fortitude ; counseled you to silent meditation through Vigil ; we tried to arouse in you the power of Spiritual Courage and the gift of Perspicacity , which is but the Prophecy of the ancient religious Scholastic. Thus has Masonry tried to awaken within you the four Cardinal Virtues and their traditional corollaries. This word, coming from the Latin cardinalis signifying “door” or “hinges”, shows you that the Ritual had tried to open doors within you, by which the Superior Light may one day flow into you. My Brother, Apprentice, through this brief sketch you should now have a partial understanding of the allegories of your Reception as an Apprentice. Have ever in mind this overriding thought: know that all the understanding that you will receive, as much from the bosom of Masonry as from your reading and meditations, must lead you towards a perpetual improvement of yourself, of your Brothers and of Society, as well as to the moral development which will necessarily result from this. Such is the spirit in which you must cultivate the sciences in which we will have the opportunity to explain to you during your reception as a Companion. A few moments’ silence, or soft and slow music. FIRST JOURNEY: THE FIVE SENSES First Cartouche: Sight, Hearing, Touch, Smell and Taste. WM: – My Brother, to arrive at the Degree which you solicit, you have Five Journeys to make, no longer across the Universal Elements , but within yourself, across your own sensory activities. Brother Expert, please equip this Apprentice with a Gavel and Chisel , then taking him by the right hand, have him make the First Journey. The Brother Expert takes the Crowbar from the hands of the Apprentice which he had hitherto held across the shoulders, and hands him the Gavel and Chisel , takes him by the right hand, and makes him go once round the Lodge by means of the West towards the South. He continues, ending in the West between the two"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85 Columns, and alerts the Senior Warden that the First Journey has ended. SW: – Worshipful Master, the First Journey of the Apprentice is ended. Brother Expert, replace the Tools carried by the Traveler on the Altar of Work. WM: – My Brother, this First Journey represents the first year of study of the Neophyte; its symbolism is expressed by the Gavel and Chisel . Until this moment you have only been busy with rough-hewing the rough ashlar: now, as a Companion, you must learn to carve the materials and give them that polish and elegance which should shine forth in this Temple which we are called to raise, firstly within ourselves, then in Human Society, and which is, according to the famous inscription in the Temple of Rameses II, a vestige of ancient and Worshipful Egypt, in its proportions and its disposition, “in the image of the very Heavens..”. Such is the use that the initiated Workman must make of the Tools which are given to him. You are already too well instructed in the figurative language of Masonry for it to be necessary for us to emphasize the esoteric significance of this Symbolism. Indeed you know that you must apply the principles and precepts of the manual art, from which Masonry has borrowed its exterior forms, to the intellectual faculties. But above all the Mason must seek to know himself, and it is for this reason that the first subject indicated to your study is the Five Senses . This title, the Five Senses , should not be considered as absolute, since it refers both to the corporeal organs and the faculties of the soul. Now, the soul is only able to approach the ambient world by means of the five organs that the body places at its disposal in order to understand the exterior world, and also to take possession of it. We see that four of these, Sight, Hearing, Taste and Smell are to be found assembled and conjoined in one single location: whereas Feeling, like Touch, spread over the entire corporeal surface, is in consequence only the auxiliary and companion of the four others. We can do no better regarding these Five Senses than to counsel you to exercise discipline at all times. Turn your eyes from anything which might risk polluting your vision. Close your ears to words which divide or which impair your inner life. Discipline your taste by curbing excess. May your sense of smell know how to distinguish between purifying perfumes and those which degrade and debase. And may your hand henceforth only know those gestures which honor and ignore those which insult. My Brother Apprentice, please salute the Orient with the Sign of your Grade. The Apprentice salutes with the sign of the Square. SECOND JOURNEY:THE ORDERS OF ARCHITECTURE Second Cartouche: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 WM: – Brother Expert, please have the Candidate take his Second Journey, and in order to do this, hand him the Level and Plumb 6 3 . The Brother Expert takes the Level and Plumb from the Altar of Work and hands them to the Candidate . Then he has him go once round the Lodge by means of the West towards the North, returning by the South. While passing, he has him observe the Cartouche bearing the names of the four Orders of Architecture. SW: – Worshipful Master, the Second Journey of the Apprentice is ended. Brother Expert, replace the Tools carried by the Traveler on the Altar of Work. WM: – My Brother, this Second Journey represents the second year, or rather the second epoch in the life of the Initiate. I will not speak to you of the material use of the Tools which you have carried during this circumambulation 6 4 . You now know that they are not about material Operative Masonry, but rather the edification of an Inner Temple within yourself, and that of another Temple, having All Humanity for stones, and that the Tools also indicate Virtues, natural Gifts and human Faculties, put into action for this purpose, which the Metaphysical Principles which are used by the Divine Organizer to order, conduct and perfect his cosmic Masterpiece. The architecture in question here is not material architecture, you may be sure. This word in fact derives from the Greek A RKITEKTOE , just as the Architect is called A RKITEKTOS or also A RKITEKTONIKOS . From Greek we also find A RKE : supreme, divine; and T EKNIKOS : technique. And so our Esoteric Architecture is the Supreme and Divine Technique which from an individual with animal and gross passions allows the creation of an evolved, refined being, an imperfect reflection but despite this a refracted image of his Divine Model. In this domain, the four Orders of Architecture , as you realize, do not indicate material types of realization in this domain, however perfect they may be. They designate esoterically the three Theological Virtues which, in ancient medieval Scholasticism, the four Cardinal Virtues. These are Faith , Hope and Charity , which follow Prudence , Temperance , Justice and Fortitude . They also designate our three Columns which, by their luminous Right Angle on the Pavement of our Lodges have forever framed Wisdom , Strength and Beauty . The characteristic of the Column in the Doric style, massive and short, is to have a height equal to eight times the diameter at its base. The characteristic of the Column in the Ionic style, more svelte and gracious, is to have a height equal to nine times the diameter at its base. The characteristic of the Corinthian style, the most beautiful of all, if to have a height equal to ten times the diameter at its base.   6 3 “Perpendiculaire” , usually a Plumb in Lodges. 6 4 “périple”: as this links to ‘circumference’ the traditional word ‘circumambulation’; seems appropriate."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87 The Column in the Tuscan style participates in the three preceding styles, of which it is the synthesis. Its symbolism likewise participates in the three others, and it constitutes an arcanum which is not to be unveiled in a Companions’ Lodge. Your attention will most certainly have been drawn to the number attributed to each style regarding the proportions of its Column: eight , nine and ten . Eight is the number of Charity , nine that of Hope and ten that of Faith . In the same order of ideas, the Corinthian Column is that of Wisdom , the Doric Column is that of Strength and the Ionic Column is that of Beauty . The sum of the three numbers gives twenty-seven: the Number of the Universe . Now you understand, my young Brother, that these four Orders of Architecture esoterically designate the three higher modes of behavior in the moral, intellectual and spiritual planes, and their ultimate harmonious synthesis. For the Inner Temple which you will henceforth build within yourself will pass through the three types of architecture in the rhythm of your daily behavior. When you reveal yourself by manifesting Masonic Faith , it will be Corinthian; when you reveal yourself by manifesting Masonic Hope , it will be Ionic; and when you reveal yourself according to Masonic Charity , it will be Doric. But one day, when you have become a true Master, the synthesis of the Tuscan style will become yours, and your Inner Temple will be in accordance with that. The Doric Column has lent the Man’s form its nobility and strength. The Ionic Column has lent the Woman’s body its delicacy and beauty. The Corinthian Column lends androgynous Adolescence its more slender form, in which it is not forbidden to see the descent of Man and Woman. Ancient, mysterious and wise Egypt would, in these, have meditated upon the triple symbol of Osiris, Isis and Horus, the triple manifestation of the divine mystery, refracted in man.

THIRD JOURNEY: THE LIBERAL ARTS & SCIENCES Third Cartouche: Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Astronomy 6 5 . WM: – Brother Expert, please have the Candidate take his Third Journey, and in order to do this, hand him the Square and Compasses . The Brother Expert takes the Square and Compasses from the Altar of Work and hands them to the Candidate . Then he has him go once round the Lodge passing by the South and returning by the East. While passing, he has him read the names of the Seven   6 5 In a different order to the first listing at the start of the Degree."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88 Orders of Architecture, then he leads him between the two Columns. SW: – Worshipful Master, the Third Journey of the Apprentice is ended. Brother Expert, replace the Tools carried by the Traveler on the Altar of Work. WM: – My Brother, this Third Journey represents the third year of study of the Initiate. Its symbolism is sufficient clear to not have need for long justification. It is evident that the Masons, in order to claim perfect Mastership, must be an educated, not an ignorant man. You know the significance of these seven names. However, there is a Masonic aspect to these subjects, which is applied to the inner life of our Lodges. I believe it will be useful to present you these seven sciences, though classical, in a light which particularly evokes their action within you, and through you regarding other people. Grammar , for the Mason, consists of the correct observation of the way of speaking and the precise orthography of Masonic language and terminology in Lodge, of the ritualistic prescriptions (Openings and Closings of the Works, Initiatory Ceremonies), the wearing of the traditional, complete and exact “decorations”, and finally the equally correct use of gestures and probatory attitudes. These are all things which, little by little, penetrate the Mason newly entered into the Order, infuse him with the Masonic spirit and make him insensibly the “vehicle” of the latter, its living expression, in the simple intellectual and moral planes. The quality of a Mason may be recognized in the attentive observance of all of these elements, and thus one can say that this Brother expresses himself Masonically, in conformity with the esoteric Grammar of the entire Order. Rhetoric allow a Masons to express with elegance and clarity that which he is capable of communicating to another person. And since that which has been well- conceived is clearly enunciated, it will, little by little, demonstrate the need, in order to normalize and regularize the behavior of that other person, or to correct his way of thinking, to put one’s own ideas in order first before speaking. Thus he will have observed the old Masonic device: “Ordo ab chao 6 6 ”. Equally he will understand the necessity, in order to convince another, of acquiring the art of rhythm in enunciating his proposals, the science of “meter 6 7 ” in matters of prose just as it is customary in the domain of poetry. Did not the Masonic Temple, under its term Lodge , draw this name from the Greek logos signifying the eminently occult role of the Word 6 8 ? Logic is the essential tool of Reason . It is the methodical art of setting up the scaffolding of our ideas, the art of regulating the use of the faculties of understanding, of   6 6 Order out of Chaos – Albert Pike’s motto for the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite. 6 7 “chutes” – lit. falls, tumbles. As this refers to rhythm, prose and poetry, this is a best guess. 6 8 Remember the French for Lodge is ‘loge’, which is closer to ‘logos’ than ‘lodge’. Either way, this is still an etymological stretch."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89 linking our concepts. Perceiving in a precise manner, comparing, judging with knowledge and justice, and discoursing with clarity are the very conditions of good logic. Only accept things as true when they appear incontestably to be so; see the issues beneath all their aspects, let them conceal nothing, divide them into their smallest parts, so that all may be submitted to examination in order to arrive at a solid foundation, a rigorously valid solution. Then reassemble the simplest objects, and when understanding those is easy, move on to more complex objects. Finally, bring to their enumeration such a close attention that nothing may be omitted from their inventory. These, my Brother, are the conditions which you must impose on all your intellectual activities. Arithmetic is the science of Numbers and their manipulation. The study of their symbolism id, along with Geometry, essential for the Mason worthy of that name, for Numbers (we do not say Figures, which are only their ideograms), Numbers allow access to a whole philosophy and to a true metaphysics. “Everything is arranged according to Number” Iamblichus tells us, citing the Heiros Logos of Pythagoras, and affirmation repeated by Aristoxenes of Tarentum. In fact, in Pythagorean metaphysics, the ten first Numbers, source of all others, constitute the initial classification of all ordinary numbers and, in consequence, are truly metaphysical potentialities, transcendent in the Universe. They only become immanent through the intervention of the vulgar numbers which issue from them. This is the notion of the Idea-Number, or Pure-Number developed by Nicomachus of Gerasa in his Theologumena Arithmeticae , which also tells us that “the divine Decade is itself the All , for it has served to measure All , as the Square and Line in the hand of the Organizer”. It is that which Solomon, emblem of the Grand Master of Universal Masonry, expresses in his book Wisdom in telling us: “But Thou, O Eternal One, Thou ruleth over all things by Measure and Number and Weight .” Geometry is also indisputably the science of the Mason. “Let nothing enter here if it is not geometry”, declared Pythagoras. Truly there is nothing more philosophically esoteric than Geometry. He who would wish to go to the trouble of seeking the metaphysics secretly enfolded within its essential theories, that man will enter into a marvelous “garden”. If we doubt these things, it would suffice us, my Brother, to reread the seventh and renowned letter of Plato, which we will permit ourselves to recall for you: “If someone is found to write a book in which he claims to expose my doctrine on the points closest to my heart, which he believe he has learned from me or from another, or came to them himself, know that this man understands nothing about it. For there is nothing written which treats of these various points, and such will never exist. For this knowledge cannot be transmitted as a banal set of theorems: it is only after prolonged meditation, and after an intimate familiarity with his object that, as if set on fire by a lightning bolt, the inner flame bursts forth, and its light endures without the need for external fuel... Since, for him who has once and for all grasped this teaching, there is no"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90 danger that it will ever be forgotten. It only works through a few very short formulae, and only very few men existing understand it. 6 9 ” This is the mysterious interior “garden” which we have just evoked, my Brother. The heavy perfume of the ancient Mysteries ever hangs there, and in its center, from which spread the great paths of initiatory thought, stands immutable and tutelary the Royal Tree of Philosophy par excellence, that of the great and divine secret of Numbers ... Music , in the same Pythagorean climate of the ancient world, was not designated solely a science of sonorous harmony, but also the nine Subjects personified by the nine Muses. In fact the term ‘ Music’ comes in fact from the very name of the Muses. This comes out of the Greek mousa , the present participle of maomaï , the primitive form of maïno : to think, understand, enthuse. What could be more significant? Does one not talk of the “joy of knowledge”? It is evident, in fact, that the Mason should be an educated man, and that to the maximum. The letter “G” which shines in the center of our “ Flaming Star ” in the Orient of this Temple is its symbolic representation. It is the initial of the Greek work “ Gnosis ”, signifying “Knowledge”. And in his celebrated Stromata Clement of Alexandria affirms his admiration for Plato by declaring that: “If we were to choose between Health and Gnosis, our interest would be to choose Gnosis”. Long before the Alexandrine tradition, the prophet Hosea stigmatized Ignorance in these terms: “Thus says the Eternal One: ‘My people are destroyed because they have lost Gnosis! And since they have rejected Gnosis, I shall reject them and they shall be stripped of My priesthood’”. And the founder of Christianity will similarly chastise the followers of Ignorance: “Woe to you, Doctors of the Law! For you possess the keys of Gnosis, and you do not use them to improve yourselves, but to prevent others from achieving it”. Astronomy, as is indicated by the Greek origin of the term (aster: stars, and nomos: laws), is the science of the movements of the celestial bodies. The purely descriptive part of Astronomy is often designated by the terms Uranography and Cosmography. You should always interest yourself in keeping up to date with the various progresses made in this science, my Brother, since it involves the knowledge of the majority of the others: mathematics, physics, chemistry, optics, etc. It is progress in these sciences which, little by little, permits Man to create for himself an idea of the Universe, a little more exact and precise than that which was the vision of previous generations. It will always be difficult for a Mason passionate for the science of the Heavens to be interested in base or totally profane subjects. For the sight of the starry firmament is the immutable progenitor of the highest thoughts.   6 9 As usual this is not a direct quotation from Plato’s Seventh Letter but a very loose paraphrase of part of it, reinterpreted to emphasize Ambelain’s point."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"91 Of all the sciences, Astronomy is thus that which may best enlighten us regarding our relative worth, lead us to a better understanding of the correspondences which link our terrestrial globe to the rest of the Universe. Without it, as the history of past centuries bears witness, it is impossible to know from whence we came, who we are, or to establish a constructive comparison between the place we occupy in Space and the totality of this Universe. Without it we would ignore both the true expanse of our cosmic “country”, its nature, and the nebulous land to which it belongs. Enclosed in the language of our ignorance, we would not be capable of forming the least idea of the general disposition of the world. Then a thick fog would cover the narrow horizon which hems us in, and our thoughts would remain incapable of raising themselves above the mean preoccupations of daily life, to cross the narrow sphere drawn by the limits of the action of our senses. After this short examination of the Liberal Arts, you should understand, my Brother, that no science should remain unknown to a Mason, since all of them can be the source of a Virtue . My Brother, this does not mean that you must obtain a thorough understanding of all the Sciences; it is enough for a Mason and for all men in general to possess at least the elementary concepts of each of them, in order to avoid the errors and prejudices that total ignorance will lead him to commit. So work to acquire those concepts which you lack, for in the ancient Initiations, the Neophyte did not return into Society until he had traveled through the cycle of human knowledge, and only them was he considered to be truly initiated .

FOURTH JOURNEY: THE PHILSOPHERS Fourth Cartouche: Solon, Socrates, Lycurgos, Pythagoras, “I.N.R.I.”. WM: – Brother Expert, please have the Candidate take his Fourth Journey, and in order to do this, hand him the Compasses and the Ruler . The Brother Expert takes the Compasses and Ruler from the Altar of Work and hands them to the Candidate . Then he has him go once round the Lodge by means of the North. While passing, he has him contemplate the names written in the Cartouche, then leads him to the West. WM: – Brother, Expert, is the Fourth Journey ended?"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 Expert: – It is, Worshipful Master. WM: – Brother Expert, please replace the Tools of the Traveler on the Altar of Work. My Brother, in the course of your Fourth Journey, we have put you in the presence of certain names, the pride and honor of Philosophy. The first, Solon , was one of the seven sages of ancient Greece. At this time, scarcely one Athenian in eight actually possessed any civil rights, and the Athenian people were divided into citizens (scarcely an eighth of the total population); aliens, inhabitants of foreign origins, possessing no rights except that of residency, and whose children were necessarily bastards, inheriting none of their parents’ goods; and slaves , considered to be material goods, having no legal existence, any familiar organization, being nothing more than domestic animals. At this time, Solon had the courage to fight in Athens for a Constitution aimed at replacing the old, draconian, inhuman regime, which considered as a highly religious ceremony one where the baptism of a ship basically consisted of the sacrifice of a slave, spread-eagled naked across the bow of the ship, crushed between the bow and the quay, whose blood so shed was considered an offering to the gods. The second, Socrates , was the creator of moral education. He didn’t hesitate to demonstrate the ridiculous aspect, poor example and infantile character of the pagan religions of his time. For him the gods, molded with the same qualities and faults as men, had no right to demand from them their costly adoration. He resisted the thirty Tyrants who had usurped the power of Athens, and he never ceased to reproach them for their exactions and their crimes; and in his turn, accused by people in their pay, was condemned to death and had to drink hemlock. He did this while smiling, thus showing that a good man whose conscience is at peace, absolutely knows not how to fear death. His philosophy rests on the knowledge of oneself. Against the sophisticated methods of the philosophers who had preceded him, with their vain reasoning, he substituted the method of observations, which we use today. The third, Lycurgos , was a legislator in Sparta. Obliged to go into exile to escape his adversaries, he visited all of Asia Minor, learning and observing wherever he stayed. On returning to his own country, he found disorder and embezzlement, and became convinced of the need to reform the turbulent and barbarous people who were the Spartans. He then went to Delphi and consulted the Oracle of Apollo, which responded through the voice of the Pythia: “that he was going to lay the foundations of the most celebrated republic in History”. He returned to Sparta, where his laws were then adopted. Nevertheless this was not without opposition, and he had an eye punctured in the public square during a scuffle. His laws were founded upon profound wisdom, ultimately leading to love for one’s country and a purification of morals, creating courageous citizens. We do not know the true circumstances of his death, but it is believed that he returned to die close to the Temple of Delphi, following a fast which was voluntarily prolonged until his final liberation."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93 The fourth, Pythagoras , was born in Samos, and was at first a sculptor and athlete. At the age of eighteen he won the prize for wrestling at the Olympic Games. A pupil of Pherekydes, he adopted the latter’s theory on the immortality of the human soul. Traveling through Egypt, Greece, Chaldea and Asia Minor, he was able to learn about the very sources of ancient esotericism. Some say he even went on to visit India. Finally, forty years old, he returned to sojourn in Greater Greece, at Croton, a town nowadays situated in the Southern part of Italy. There he founded a famous institute, a kind of sacerdotal, mystical and scientific corporation. One could only be admitted after a novitiate of silence which lasted two years if one was classed as a serious candidate, or five years if one was estimated to be a little frivolous. There they lived communally, abstaining from non-ritual meats, and cultivating all the sciences of that epoch: mathematics and arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy, astrology, etc. There they taught everything that we now find in our esoteric traditions, that is to say: the transmigration of the soul for the profane who are chained to the “wheel” of life, but final liberation for initiates who have scrupulously observed the rule of the Order; the gross and malefic aspect of the material World, and the absolute reality of a spiritual universe in which all is in the archetypal state, the eternal image , the perfect model for that which is refracted in a very imperfect manner in our material universe. The fifth, characterized by the sigil “I.N.R.I.”, designates th e mystical and philosophical current issued forth from the founder of Christianity, that is to say, Jesus Christ Himself. His historical reality is not proven by the Christian writings, but rather by the positions taken by the adversaries of his closest disciples, and these support that very reality which is not, in this sense, under discussion. Under the sigil “I.N.R.I.” it is not only the moral and social program of education contained within Freemasonry that is understood, but also that of our illustrious founders, the mysterious Rose+Cross . Love of one’s neighbor, scorn for the impermanent riches and honors of this very imperfect and deceitful world, a permanent fight against Evil in all its aspects, the purification of Man, Nature and the entire Cosmos. Christianity necessarily comprised an essential part of the Inner Alchemy, if one knew how to free oneself from all clerical and selfish mastery. The sigil, as you are no doubt aware, signifies: “ Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum ”, meaning: “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews”, the inscription figured on the cross upon which Jesus died. The Rose+Cross , our occult guides, saw in it this alchemical device: “ Igne Natura Renovatur Integra ”, meaning: “It is through Fire that Nature renews itself”. One can also see there: “ Intra Nobis Regnum Ieshouah ”, meaning: “The Kingdom of God is within us”. We can also read the Hebrew words for the four Elements: “ Iammim ” (Water), “ Nour ” (Fire), “ Ruach ” (Air), “ Iebechah ” (Earth). Let us conclude that these five philosophical systems indicate nothing less than inner potentialities , sleeping in man, and which had to be awakened in turn, as they were awakened in Humanity, in the Collective Man , through the course of the ages and at the call of those sent from On High to promote them. The first, Solon , was his system rest upon Justice : the second, Socrates , saw his founded upon Prudence . The third, Lycurgos , saw his resting on Fortitude . The fourth, Pythagoras , saw his seated upon the virtue of Temperance . And the fifth, veiled behind"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 the sigil “I.N.R.I.”, is the quintessence of all the others, the Chrysopeia , born of and resulting from the four Elements : Earth ( Prudence ), Water ( Temperance ), Air ( Justice ) and Fire ( Fortitude ), the four branches of the Cross in the center of which is born the Rose of our illustrious promoters of yesteryear.

FIFTH JOURNEY: GLORIFICATION OF LABOR WM: – Brother Expert, please have the Candidate take his Fifth Journey, but for this last circumambulation, you will observe our custom of leaving his hands free. The Brother Expert has the Apprentice go once round the Lodge leaving the West, passing by the South and the East, and leads him between the Columns in the West. WM: – Brother, Expert, is the Fifth Journey ended? Expert: – It is, Worshipful Master. WM: – My Brother, you have completed this Fifth Journey with free hands, but still wearing your Apron, the emblem of Work. In truth, we have but a very short time to live, and we must spend it in labor. Still, this labor is performed in the Liberty that we exercise, and this is expressed by the fact that this last journey is accomplished with free hands. We should also perform it with Impartiality. We cannot become Masons except through journeys which sow the seeds of a better Future, like our forebears, the Rose+Cross . Here, too we find the symbolism of the free hands. My Brother, you should therefore penetrate the duties that liberty imposes on man; in society, the great secret of enjoying it without dissolution is to use it without harming ones fellow-man. Your practical education as a Mason is ended. Henceforth you will leave the practical plane, this formal world so that, with new insights, you may hope to access a very different world. It only remains to you to file away in your spirit that which you have learned, so that you may be able, through your work and your example, to transmit to those who will come after you that which you have yourself received. Our constant aim, as Masons, is the perfection of society through the propagation of the sciences; and the moral and spiritual improvement of humanity by the morality resulting from the influence in us of every piece of knowledge.

In summarizing what you have learned during the course of your preceding “Journeys”, you have noted that the study of yourself is the first level of study in order to come to wisdom. Remember moreover that it is from one of the most respected sciences, Astronomy , that Masonry has extracted the allegorical formulae which give a kind of body to its thoughts. Thus, all the emblems which decorate its Temples are there to remind us of the Great Temple of the Universe, and the Blazing Star which shines in their Orient is the most esoteric emblem of the Mysterious Cause of the Author of all these marvels, which we have named the Grand Architect of the Universe , and which the Pythagoreans called the “ God Who Geometrizes ”.

Many times the Ritual underlined how your complete, absolute acceptance, without any mental reservation, gave efficacy to this entry into the secular Chain uniting Freemasons across time and place; notwithstanding the simplicity of the Symbols thus put into action, and sometimes even the poverty of these simulacra serving as a vehicle for the manifestation of our Mysteries. Moreover, these platonic teachings were recalled through various repetitions, which indicated that “to be initiated is to die”, and “those who have drawn close to sacred initiations and those who ignore them will not, in the abode of the dead, have similar destinies...”. Today, are going to follow your periplus in this mysterious and unknown World. For the second time the Initiatory Ritual born of early times will put you in the presence of what the ancient Initiations named, with as much terror as respect: “ the Mysteries”. You may be sure that all of Masonic ritual is none other than the equivalent of the “ Book of the Dead ” of ancient Egypt. From the ancient mysteries, celebrated long ago in the temples of Memphis, to the veiled lights of Orphic teachings which illuminated the initiates of Greater Greece at Crotona or Metaponte, the continuity is perfect, and it is through yourself that you will come to realize this. The Initiation which, since your reception as Apprentice has led you here and, I trust, will soon make of you a Candidate for Mastership, is in fact, through the revelation of its symbols, a very real funerary ritual. As Plato tells us, Freemasonry has no other object than to “teach you to die”. It first teaches you to kill the “old man” within, the instinctive and egotistical being. After this it teaches you to direct your steps into a universe unfamiliar to you. And in a short time it will teach you to live again , this time forever... In drawing your attention to your five senses, Masonry teaches you the need to preserve, whatever may befall , these potentialities which constitute the permanence of consciousness . By teaching you the human sciences, Masonry built up your spirit, and gave your soul the necessary tools to know, to appreciate, to judge . By placing you in the presence of various stages of philosophy and morality, enjoining you to observe them, to the improvement of yourself and your fellow man, it gave your soul the opportunity to lay claim to eternal light which that received in your initiation as Apprentice was but a pale reflection. From this you now begin to comprehend why we insist on a belief in the immortal soul, and in a subtle plane from which it comes and to which it aspires to return, which we called the Eternal Orient , being the conditions of your postulate. Brother Orator, please give he who is going to become a Companion the traditional discourse of our tradition. Orator: – My Brother, it is only through legend, myth, image and symbol that the spirit of man may approach higher truths. For him, all is presented as if in a dream, and it is banal and common images which express transcendent realities."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"97 For the followers of Pythagoras and Plato, the soul, stripped of its carnal envelope, proceeds along a single route, in dim light, and then arrives as a crossroads. There it must choose between two routes, two roads, one leading to its left, the other to its right. It is at this crossroads that it must decide its ultimate destiny: to be a fortunate immortal, or to suffer a dissociation of the personality and its return to inferior forms of life. It is “ Gnosis ”, represented by the letter “G”, and communicated by initiatic “ Light ”, and conveyed by the “ Blazing Star ” which conditions triumph in this test. The image of his mysterious “crossroads”, where the ultimate journey finds its end, is presented to you by Freemasonry. The S q u a r e represents the two roads, before the C o m p a s s e s symbolizing the Divine Architect. This tradition was known to the Greeks through Pythagoras, and in Judea through Kabbalism. Do we not read the following passage in one of the prophetic books: “For the King of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with teraphim, he looked in the liver. At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem... And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken... ” (Ezekiel: XXI, 21). 7 3 It is the same in the Orphic Mysteries. The soul, coming to a crossroads on the path followed by the dead, must choose between one road leading to a white Cypress, shading a spring from which flows the Water of Forgetfulness. The Mystic has previously been warned that he must certainly not approach this way. On the contrary, he must take the right-hand path, which leads to the fresh water of the Lake of Memory. It is a survival of this image which gave birth to the superstition which says that the crossing of a river and one of its tributaries, or the bifurcation of two roads in a forest, are supposed to constitute places where one may, more than in other places, stir up and propitiate subterranean entities or the dead. See then in this symbolism, my Brother, the need to construct within yourself a enduring being, a human entity who through his high intellectual moral and spiritual worth, will be able to endure beyond corporeal death, and finally arrive at the Eternal Orient, freed of all desire and all need. It is by three steps of Apprentice , the little death 7 4 , that you have been placed in the presence of the Light, and you were then taught the need to kill the old man within you. It is by the two steps of C o m p a n i o n that you have been led to the Great Crossroads, where you must choose between the way of darkness, leading towards the dissolution of your personality, or the luminous path leading towards the full flowering of man. ( Silence ).   7 3 Listed as Ezekiel XXI, 26 in Ambelain. Also, I preserved his use of the word ‘teraphim’ while the King James Bible actually uses ‘images’. 7 4 ‘ tré-pas’ is a pun on the word ‘ trépas’ , meaning ‘passage’, or more poetically and commonly , ‘death’. We realize from this the powerful symbolism of the three Masonic steps in French!"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 WM (gives a blow of the gavel): – Please rise and come to Order, my Brothers, facing the Orient.

RITUAL OF THE THIRD DEGREE • Opening of the Works • Reception of an Apprentice • Closing of the Works OBSERVATIONS The Temple should be hung with black hangings, strewn with skulls, crossbones and tears, all in silver. Each of the three Columns bear three wax candles, making nine lights in all. The Orient is called the Debhir 7 6 , and the rest of the Temple bears the name Hikhal . A large black hanging separates the two. The Masters (alone present) are dressed in black with a black tie. All should be covered, as in the “Middle Chamber” 7 7 . Myrrh burns in the Censer, in place of all other incense (The “Middle Chamber” analogically draws its name from the central box of the famous “Magic Square” of nine boxes). In the middle of the Temple, where the Trestleboard habitually is, a funerary drape in black and fringed with silver is laid out, covering a skeleton stretched out on a mat or cushion. The three Columns with their nine luminaries thus flank “Hiram’s Tomb”. The small central Altar is therefore of necessity placed between the Orient and the funerary drape. In the Hikhal , before the final illumination, there are no other lights other than those described above; penumbra reigns. The Blazing Star is lit, in the North- West of the Temple.

The Masons for whom we weep is our Master, who was called Imhotep in Egypt and Hiram Abif in Tyre, and who directed our Works across the World, advised us, and enlightened us with his sage counsels. As knowledgeable in architecture as working in metals, he was sent by Hiram, King of Tyre, to King Solomon, to direct the construction of the Temple at Jerusalem, which the people of Israel intended to erect to the glory of the Divine Architect of the Universe. Hiram divided his workmen in to three groups: Apprentices, Companions and Masters. To differentiate between them and to recognize them, he gave each their own class of Words, Signs and a Grip. The signs of recognition are those which still serve us in the Grades of Apprentice and Companion. The works drawing to their close, three wicked Companions, having been unable to obtain their Mastership, decided to extract the Signs, Words and Grips of Master from Hiram Abif by any means. The Master Architect had the habit, when the building yards were empty following the departure of the Workmen, of going to inspect the Works. They each hid themselves at one of the three Gates of the Temple, and waited for him. When his visit was ended, Hiram left the Middle Chamber and made his way towards the West Gate.

But before pressing on with your search, let us assume that the Master’s Word and Sign have been obtained from Hiram, and agree in advance that the first Word which spring from our lips, and the first Sign which escapes us, shall be considered by us to have been inspired from On High. Thus, the Sign and the Word shall henceforth become the Sacred Word and Sign of recognition among Masters. My Brothers, please excavate the soil of this mound. The Brother Expert raises the funerary drape, removes the Apron veiling the face of the Candidate and, with the other Brothers, gives the Sign of Horror . Expert: – M...B...!

He then places the Branch of Acacia on the Compasses , Square and Holy Book on the dais of the Very Worshipful Master . VWM: – My Brothers, let us put an end to our sadness. The Acacia is and shall be to us the essential mark of recognition among Masters. In certain processions, the priests of ancient Egypt carried a holy Ark, made from Acacia wood. And on the sides of this Ark could be read the following inscription: “Osiris rises up anew”. This, then, was a representation of eternal life, symbolized by the grain which dies in the earth in order to be reborn, and carrying within itself the glory and all the power of the future tree. Likewise was the holy Ark of the people of Israel not made of Acacia wood covered with gold? Thus light finally triumphs over darkness, life triumphs over death, knowledge triumphs over ignorance and liberty over oppression. Worshipful Brother Expert, please conduct our Brother to his seat, among the Masters in the Middle Chamber, and may the Light of Ancient Egypt illumine our whole Temple...( Illumination )."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 Brother Companion, the moment has come to explain to you the high symbolism drawn from the legend of Hiram, which we have brought to life for you, and from the initiation which you have just in part received. Hiram, in this esoteric tradition, represents Knowledge , signified by the letter “G”, revealed after your reception into the grade of Companion. It stands for Gnosis – that essential instrument for the Salvation of Man and his immortality. The three evil Companions who assailed him are the vehicles and hypostases of Error , symbolized by the reversing of the symbolism of the Rule (the image of Truth ); of Fanaticism , symbolized by the Square (the image of Rectitude ); and Pride , expressing the authority of the Gavel, but an authority which one tries to usurp by means of this same Pride. This triple warning against the dangers which follow the Initiate from the moment he seeks his Ideal and looks for the Truth, should incite you to exercise the greatest vigilance towards yourself, as much as towards the ignorant crowd, still unfit to receive particular truths. This first part of Initiation into Mastership recalls the symbolism of the Chamber of Reflection. To achieve absolute Mastership, everything profane which lives within you must completely die in order to be reborn to a new life, made of abnegation and self- sacrifice. The rest of the Ceremony showed you how you were going to be able to come out of your Tomb in order to take up a new form of “life”. Firstly, three Brothers left to seek you. Why three? To recall to your mind your first steps as an Apprentice upon the initiatic road, to show you that the teachings of initiation in the first grade must always be in your mind, and that, without them, you could do nothing. But these three Brothers should above all have reminded you of what you said at the time of your first entry into Masonry, that is that to be initiated is to above all to learn to die, as Plato said. For the march of three steps of the Apprentice is to recall the trépas 8 7 – the death of the old man. But these three Brothers were unable to find you, and this signifies the fact that the teachings given to the Apprentice are incomplete, and that you should not be content with them alone. Then, five Brothers were assembled to find you. Five is the number which characterizes the grade of Companion, and its symbolic Journeys. As before, it is an invitation to you to recollect the knowledge acquired in this grade. But the last Companion received understood that this second attempt was doomed to defeat, for   8 7 A play on the words trois pas , three steps, and trépas , passage of the dead ( trépassé means the dead or departed)."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"115 nothing amenable to the binary is complete. Also, failure marked this second initiative to have you reborn to the true life to which you aspire. Thus is was necessary for seven Brothers to come and find you. Seven is in fact the characteristic number of Masters, that which shows you that the initiatory knowledge of a Master Mason must comprise all the teachings of the three grades, which thus constitute and indivisible whole. But three Brothers of the required seven cooperated to raise you out of the Tomb, to make you reborn. This is to show you that, in the mass of Initiates, only some achieve the highest initiatic results. It also shows you that of the septenary of moral virtues revealed to you in your previous initiations, three are more important than the others. These are: Faith , in our O RDER and in its ideals; Hope that, whatever may come, these ideals will one day be realized in their entirety; Charity , that is to say, the love of Brothers one for another, which is the best cement lying between all the stones of our Temple. The Worshipful Brother Expert was charged with raising you with the assistance of two other Brothers, and it was he who led you out of the Tomb by the Five Points of Perfection of Master 8 8 . I leave to your meditation the care of arriving at the meaning of this detail of our Ritual. Simply remember that the Worshipful Brother Expert, in the initiatic “mystery”, fills the role of Hermes, Conductor of the Dead in ancient Egypt, he who lead Souls to the Sovereign Tribunal of the Ineffable God. The Five Points of Master have the following significance: the first, the pedal, shows that we are ever ready to walk to the aid of our Brothers; the second, the bending of the knees, is there to incite us to humility, and sets us on guard against immoderate and rash ambition. The third, the joining of hands, recalls to us that we must assist our Brothers, in need as in misfortune, and that it is the Blazing Star which its five points of light, which puts the final seal on our fraternity, from which comes the disposition of the five fingers in the grip of Master Masons. The fourth, left hand upon the shoulder, shows you that you must listen to the teachings to inspire your wisdom, those counsels which will always come from your elders. The fifth, the fraternal kiss, indicates that sweetness, that inalterable union, which must be at the very foundation of our Order. On the Tomb in which you were laid down, was a Sprig of Acacia , Compasses , a Square at your head, and a Square at your feet. The Acacia symbolizes rebirth 8 9 , the Compasses at your head recalls the bounds from which you should never deviate in all your actions. The Square at your feet is there so that you will never forget to secure your foundations and support your reasoning upon sound and true knowledge.   8 8 Known as the Five Points of Fellowship in many Orders. 8 9 Renaissance: rebirth, regeneration, renewal, revival."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116 The Ritual teaches us that when a Master is lost, he will be found again between the Compasses and the Square . The first sense of this axiom is that the Master Mason worthy of this name cannot err, since he is ever on the way of Duty (the Square ) and of Reason or Intelligence (the Compasses ). The second sense we leave to your meditation reminding you only that the Compasses , according to the ancient symbolism of our Order, signifies Heaven , and that the Square signifies Earth . Thus is appears that the Master who strays, in the spiritual 9 0 sense of the word, is induced to wander between two Worlds. But once again, we find this esoteric arcanum holding the oldest Traditions of our Order. In the second part of the Ceremony, you took the place of Hiram, and you should therefore understand that the Architect is reborn and lives in his disciples ; for he is called to pursue his masterpiece in order to perfect it, and in his turn bequeath the results of his labor to those who survive him. My Brother, now that you have lived and understood the supreme initiation which completes those which preceded it, we are going to share our Work in the Middle Chamber with you. Do you agree to work with us towards the accomplishment of the common Great Work 9 1 , in order to realize our secular Goal? Can.: – I do. The Brother Expert conducts the Candidate to the Debhir.

In these, faithful to the essential principle of Masonic tolerance and liberty, we have not participated 1 0 3 . May your young lady we welcome among us, as are also your families and your friends. The symbolic ceremonies which, in accordance with our accustomed rites, are going to surround the commencement of your conjugal union have nothing in common in effect, form or basis with those of religion. Their purpose is neither to bless nor confirm the civil or religious aspects of your union. Their sole purpose is to imbue the hearts and souls of our Brother and Sister 1 0 4 with those feelings of renewed duty which are incumbent upon them within the frame of conjugal life, by helping them to better understand these duties through the traditional symbolism of our rituals. I therefore invite you, my Very Dear Brother, and your new wife, to link your very souls to these ceremonies, by following them with the attention merited by the high moral import of their teachings. My Brothers and Sisters, Ladies and Gentlemen, please be seated. Column of Harmony. Music, chant, etc. WM : – Brother Orator, please give knowledge to our Brother and his companion of our Legend of the Order on this subject. Orator : – In distant times when men lived like the beasts, Osiris, the preeminent Good Being, brought to them the knowledge of that which is good, kind, and true. He was their first Initiator. But behind Onnophris, the Good Being, was outlined the great tenebrous shadow of Typhon-Seth, the eternal root of metaphysical evil and the twin brother of Osiris. And that which had to happen, happened. A first time Typhon, treacherously, trapped his brother Osiris in a trunk of precious wood, locked him in, and abandoned him to the waters of the Nile, which carried him towards the sea.   1 0 2 In France all marriages are performed by the State, but many also choose to hold a church ceremony as well, although this is not officially recognized by the State for legal purposes. 1 0 3 Literally ‘ intervened’ – PV. 1 0 4 The original says “ Brothers and Sisters ”, but this does not make sense in the context – PV."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"130 When Isis learned of what the millenary texts call “the Great Distress”, she cut her hair and put of robes of mourning, for she was become “the Widow”. Yielding to the most cruel apprehensions, she ran from border to border, seeking news from all whom she encountered. Finally, she met some small children, who by chance had seen it, and they told her by which branch of the Nile the waves had carried the chest containing the body of Osiris. This chest had been carried by the sea to the city of Byblos, in Syria, the city of Adonis. A thick bush of acacia concealed it from view. Yet because of the divine virtue which shone forth from the cadaver of the god, this bush had taken on such a level of grandeur, beauty and perfume that it was not hard to discover the chest. But Seth, roaming by night, in the moon’s rays, the better to accomplish the evil deeds which he carried within himself, found the chest and cut the body of Osiris into fourteen pieces, which he dispersed in fourteen different locations. And Isis was compelled to renew her sad search, so that each fragment might receive burial in the heart of a sanctuary. Yet neither divine justice nor that of man was satisfied with this; and Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis, with the assistance of pious men, undertook to wrest the Principle of Evil from the empire of the world. He succeeded. Then, with Isis, faithful companion of the god, with the aid of Horus, their son, his sister Nephthys, Thoth and Anubis, confidants of the thoughts of Osiris, and inheritors of his mysterious and divine science, they discovered in these very teachings the secret of restoring one to life anew, or better still, of rendering one invulnerable to a second death. Ancient tradition has carried to us the poignant, funereal chant by which the Divine Company were able to try to call him back to life, in his loyalty beyond death: “Come to thy home, for thine enemies are not here. Come to thy home, and see me! It is I, your Divine Sister who loves thee. Do not set me aside, Osiris! When I see thee no more, my sad heart bleeds for thee, mine eyes seek thee, and I run like a madman to see thee again... Come back to she who loves thee, O Onnophris, O Good God, come back to thy Sister, come back to thy Wife! O thou whose heart beats no more, return to thy home! I am thy Sister, born of thy mother, the Gods and men weep for thee together... And I, here am I calling thee through my tears. Let my voice rise up to heaven. Dost thou hear not my voice? Am I no longer thy Sister, whom thou loved on earth among men, and none more than me was loved by thee”. And these rites were celebrated and Horus, the Divine Son, assisted by Isis, the Divine Mother, through the mysteries of life which Osiris had so fortunately revealed to his own before his death; and Osiris receive new life, through that which the ancient texts call “the passion of Osiris”, clothed once again with Eternity... WM : – Madam, you who will shortly be our Sister, you should meditate upon the high esoteric significance of this antique “mystery”, and for this reason, in silence, I will suspend the ritual for a short time. Silence. After a few moments: Orator : – Madam, you have no doubt realized that this sacred account, which has come to us through so many centuries, has been kept by our Order to help you understand how a wife worthy of that title should play a role analogous to that of ancient Isis towards"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"131 Osiris, towards her husband. She is often to him the transforming leaven: she is likewise the communicator of a new life, that of the heart. WM : – My Brother, I thank you. Brother Senior Warden, please remind us of the rightful obligations which bind Freemasons one to another. SW : – First of all, fraternity, Worshipful Master. His virtue ensures the gentleness of those relations, order, harmony, trust and affection necessary for work undertaken in common. Secondly, that solidarity on which all Masons have the right to rely, in legitimate circumstances, when he has need of his Brothers. Also that mutual instruction and education which permits all to benefit from the intelligence and knowledge of each; and which makes of our Temples centers of intellectual, moral and civic culture, in which are expounded those doctrines of progress which Freemasonry is tasked to spread abroad in the world. It is through a solemn promise, freely given, that we are bound, each to the other, and that our duty resides in a strict observance of our customs 1 0 5 . It flows from this that we are equally bound to he families of our Brothers, particularly to their wives and children, who are likewise adopted by us according to traditional and secular rite. WM : – Brother Junior Warden, please explain to the new bride how Masons envisage the matrimonial union. JW : – Worshipful Master, Freemasonry, profoundly respectful of the laws of the country, admits as valid only the union between two beings of different sex, declared by an official of the Civil State, representing the Nation. The religious form which, at the pleasure of the couple, can only clothe the blessing of their union according to their united perception and their perfect accord in this domain. Freemasonry takes no position regarding this latter decision. Situated above these several contingencies, and by virtue of its principles of liberty and tolerance, it does not consider the union of two human beings as indissoluble, if after a fair experience, a life in common becomes impossible or too painful for them. Before all and above all, Freemasonry enjoins a love shared by both spouses, outside of all familial or mundane considerations. This love, which alone in its eyes justifies the marriage of a man and woman, proclaims it boldly as the first and necessary element, the social, natural and human foundation of the family. In marriage, Freemasonry refuses to see only a simple human organization for the reproduction of the species, and still less an imposition on the spouses, who should remain free, and solely responsible for their common consciousness in this delicate domain. The great Law of Love with dominates all of Nature creates affinities between individuals as between nations; it is the sovereign regulator of the life of humans, which it makes fit to work in common towards moral and intellectual perfection, as well as the improvement in condition of future generations. It is the immutable basis of fraternity and solidarity, those two great Masonic virtues.   1 0 5 In passing it might be worth noting that Ambelain is using a number of terms from other orders, including Septentrion, Way of the Heart, Strict Observance and so on – PV."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"132 In marriage, after the first transport of heart and senses, love must take root and grow strong, and carried forward in the children, by looking out for their education, by shaping their spirit and heart according to our ideal of liberty, equality and fraternity. Later, in the decline of life, love becomes deep, affectionate friendship, in which the memories of youth let us forget the abuses of the years; it transforms itself into a still purer, more indestructible love. It is found in their descendants, who renew the chain of a Past from which the Future is born once more. WM : – Madam, and my Very Dear Brother, do you promise to give all your efforts towards realizing this ideal union, through which you will come to learn how to express the principle directives which are those of the whole Masonic Order? Brother : – We so promise, Worshipful Master. WM : – In this hope, we are going to celebrate your Conjugal Recognition according to our accustomed rites. I now invite you both to give the greatest attention to the profound significance of the symbols of this initiatory union. Blow of the gavel: O. Brother Master of Ceremonies, please raise the veil which covers the Altar of Hymenia and light the candles. The veil is lifted, and the two candles lit. WM : – Brother Grand Expert, please approach the Altar of Hymenia and fulfill your office... The Brother Grand Expert approaches the table, takes the Square in hand, and raises it to the level of the faces of the husband and wife. WM : – Consider this instrument of classic geometry. The Square is an emblem which speaks. It reconciles adversaries in a true coordination, in the order: justice, equity, organization. Thus it forms a solid and stable whole. Personifying both sense and morality, consciousness and moral rigor, it symbolizes what should be the life of a Masonic household. The Brother Grand Expert replaces the Square and takes the Compasses in hand, which he raises as before. WM : – In these Compasses, instrument of exact measurement, you see the emblem of wisdom which must direct our actions through constant self-control. Just as the head of these Compasses directs the movement of the branches through the impetus of the human"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"133 hand, so should we measure all things according to their true value, under the direction of our reason, without allowing ourselves to be invaded by false illusions. The Brother Grand Expert replaces the Compasses and takes the Level. WM : – Before this emblem of Masonic equality, allow me to remind you of the fruitful and legitimate equilibrium of those equal rights of each spouse, which should be present in a human couple for the perfection and prosperity of the common family, as much as for mutual understanding. The enfranchisement of womankind from the chains of ancient slavery should make her every day the equal to man in common rights, just as she is in trials and cares. This is an act of justice, issuing forth from the most ancient principles of Freemasonry, that a Mason more than any other citizen should observe. I should remind this assembly that it was Freemasonry which, in the 19 th Century, fought to obtain for women the right to participate in the universal proofs, and I should also remind you that it was the whole Masonic Order which first took in hand the battle for women to have the right to participate as citizens in affairs of the State? The Brother Grand Expert replaces the Level and takes the Rule. WM : – Finally, this is the Rule, which characterizes the straight line and indefeasible norms from which we should never deviate. It comprises all the virtues and qualities represented by the other geometric instruments of Freemasonry for which, after lifting the veil, we have just revealed one of their symbolic aspects. I say one in truth, for thee aspects are uniquely reserved for the symbolism of this particular ceremony. The sacred tools wear many other esoteric forms for the Mason, in many realms, and some of these aspects are even unsuspected in our first initiatory Degrees. My Brother and Lady, let there several counsels be of use during the new existence in which you are now entering. And now I kindly ask you to rise, both of you, hand in hand. Brother Grand Expert, please pass the blue sash of symbolic Freemasonry over the two newly-weds, from the right shoulder of the husband to the left hip of the wife, while our Bothers Treasurer, Hospitaller and four other Brothers will form the symbolic and most occult Arch of Steel over their heads. The six Brothers so designated create an Arch of Steel over the couple, holding their swords with arms extended. WM : – Madam, this ribbon, in the color of the Masonry of Egypt and of the very shade which symbolizes she who is called the “Lady of Turquoise”, the “Queen of the West”, that is ancient Isis; this ribbon, which closely unites you to our Brother, signifies that we now recognize you as a new member of the great Masonic family, as a Sister with the right to our common fraternal affection. In fact, from the 17 th Century the oldest documents in speculative Freemasonry show us the tradition of Masonic adoption of wives, sisters or daughters of our Brethren."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"134 Indeed, from 1693, in a manuscript from this period, property of the York Rite in Great Britain, we find the custom of receiving wives into Freemasonry. When a “military” Lodge departed obligatorily on a campaign with the Regiment to which it was attached, the Officers and sub-Officers comprising the Lodge, in the course of a special ceremony, entrusted their sisters, daughters or wives to the “civil” Lodge remaining at their usual garrison. It is there that the origin of the present ceremony of conjugal recognition arises. As a consequence of this exclusively feminine Lodges, called Lodges of Adoption, were born, immutably attached to a masculine Lodge. Brother Grand Expert, please restore the conjugal ring to our Brother so that he might place it himself on the finger of his wife. Restore the second ring to our new Sister, so that she might do the same to her husband. This is done. WM : – My Brother, Madam, these two rings, universal symbols adopted as the legal bonds which thereafter unite Man and his Companion before human society, are also the public symbol of this union. May they shine all your lives upon your hands and, beyond the tomb, attest to your common love. Brother Grand Expert, please place the symbolic wand between the hands of the newly-weds. The Brother Grand Expert hands the husband and wife the glass rod, each spouse taking one end, without straining it, and taking care not to drop it. He explains these precautions to them in a low voice. W M : – My Brother, Madam, this glass wand possesses purity, transparency and refulgence, as should your love ever be and ever endure. Yet it also possesses fragility. May this symbol remind you that this love has need of attentive and constant care. The day when, through imprudence or negligence, it is allowed to break, it truly cannot be restored, no more than could the fragments of this fragile wand of glass if it were allowed to fall to the ground. Brother Grand Expert, take back this wand and separate it into two fragments... This is done. WM : – Our Brother Grand Expert has just reminded you that Civil Law can, by a legal act of its representative, break a union. This is an aspect of human liberty – for men as well as for women – which our Order has always defended, which demands that no human being may ever be the object or the possession of another, and maintains his right to make what he will of himself, in freedom and complete honesty. This separation is a lways painful, above all when children have been born of the union. It often causes many regrets in those who sometimes have taken this decision lightly, and who perhaps could have come to dispel their misunderstandings. However,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"135 legal separation is sometimes preferable to sterile discord and undignified conflicts, which sometimes traumatize forever those children who are their impotent and mournful witnesses. When a union has become illusory, when it only serves to veil hidden hatred or scorn, it no longer has a moral right to exist. So as no to leave you with the painful impression, our ritual now looks forward to proffering the drink of perfect union. Brother Grand Expert, please fulfill your office. The Brother Grand Expert takes the glass containing the wine, which he gives to the husband; then he takes the glass containing the water to the wife. He then takes the crystal goblet and places it before them on the table. WM : – My Sister and my Brother, please slowly pour the contents of your glasses into the Nuptial Goblet. This is done. The Brother Master of Ceremonies removes the two glasses. WM : – May this union of wine and water, symbols of the eternal roots of Nature, of Light and fertile Darkness, of Sun and Moon, of Man and Woman, remind you that the different qualities must be united and melt into a total and absolute harmony, so that the fusion of two persons into one may be assured, and that the primitive Androgyne might be reconstituted. My Sister and my Brother, please drink from the goblet. The Brother Grand Expert offers the chalice to the wife, who drinks part of it, then to the husband, who must drink the rest of the mixed wine and water. The Brother Grand Expert then carries the chalice to the Worshipful Master . He places it in front of him and breaks it with a single blow of the gavel, hitting it in the middle. WM : – Just as by its definitive fracturing, this Nuptial Goblet can nevermore be polluted by a third, so may no human being ever be able to sully your mutual love. Just as the lights of the stars shine and burst forth in the heart of the universe, so may your common and enduring happiness shine and radiate about you... Brother grand Expert, please remove the Masonic sash from our Brother and Sister, and you my Brothers, break the Arch of Steel and return to your places. May all have liberty of movement once more. The Freemasons present in this Temple are going to constitute the Chain of Union. I invite all our guests to be seated. Music, the Brothers remove their gloves and form the Chain of Union, circling the Altar of the Worshipful Master, the Nuptial Table and the Spouses."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136 SW : – Worshipful Master, the Chain of Union can not be closed, for we lack one of its habitual links. The Brother who fulfills this duty remains next to his spouse. On behalf of all our Brothers, I now request that he once again takes his place among us. WM : – It will be done. Brother Grand Expert, please guide the young newly-weds, so that our new Sister herself conducts her companion to the place which he must occupy. In this manner she will learn that the wife of a Freemason must always encourage her husband to fulfill his Masonic engagements with regularity. This is done, then the Grand Expert reconducts the young lady to her seat and himself returns to the Chain of Union. SW : – Worshipful Master, our Chain of Union is now just and perfect. WM : – It is because of the companion of our Brother that this is done. Let us remember, by this example, the important role that the wives must play in the regular functioning of our Order. At every occasion we should have them understand the high moral import of our ancient rituals, the majesty of our symbols, their esoteric profundity, and the grandeur of the objectives pursued by Freemasonry, so that they may become better auxiliaries of its doctrines of Love and Goodness. My Sister, do you promise to practice the virtues that we teach in our Temples and to spread them around you? Wife : – ... WM : – Brother Grand Expert, please break the Chain by our Brother and, taking him by the hand, lead him back to the side of his spouse.

Flowers have the freshness and the elegant perfume of Woman, and fruit is the eloquent symbol of fertile maturity, the hope that the life to come will bring you happiness. The Brothers Treasurer and Hospitaller distribute the flowers from the baskets placed on their dais. When all is done: WM : – The floor is given to our Brother Orator. The Orator then explains the words required by circumstance, being sure to include the Masonic esotericism include in marriage itself. When the discourse is ended: WM : – I thank our Brother Orator once more for the words that he has just spoken. I would also particularly like to thank those persons unfamiliar with our Order who have wished, in coming to join with us, to bring witness of affection and support to the newly- weds. I hope they bring here sentiments of esteem and respect for our secular Institutions. Now, it remains for me to recall the assistance with which Freemasons end every meeting on behalf of the unfortunate. Charity is one of the principle virtues it teaches and practices. According to that custom, I ask our Brother Hospitaller to request the assistance of the young Brothers who accompanied the spouses to perform the duty under his charge. During the collection, the Column of Harmony is heard once more. When all is completed, the Collectors carry the product of their collection to the East.

May it be thus in the profane world to which you will return in a few moments. You, my Dear Brother, be the “ Jachin” of the Temple of Solomon, and you, my Dear Sister, be the “Boaz” of the same edifice, for in the beginning these two Columns rose at the threshold of the great Temple.

RITUAL FOR THE RECEPTION OF A ‘ LOUVETEAU 1 0 6 ’ In the Masonic Baptism of Louveteau , or Lowton (in the early days of English Masonry), usually a young child, around twelve years of age, so that he might be in a position to be struck by the Masonic ceremonial, must of necessity be the son of a Mason. He becomes to some extent a child adopted by his Father’s Lodge. The Lodge should therefore dispense the Masonic Baptism with great discernment, and only confer it on the sons of Masons recommended by their assiduity and by the value of their personal works. In certain Obediences the Father of a Louveteau, or his Sponsor, is presented with a Certificate which constitutes proof that he has truly received the Masonic Baptism. At a subsequent date, when he has attained the age required to become a Mason, this form will exempt him from having to submit to the material proofs of Apprentices. He will be present, at the head of the Column of the north, solely to go through them 1 0 7 . The son of a Master is qualified to go through the ceremonial to make him an Apprentice when he is eighteen years old, when he has received the Masonic Baptism, or at the age of twenty-one years, if he is profane. TEMPLE LAYOUT In the middle of the Temple is raised an altar with four sides, covered with blue cloths. On this altar are placed the Compasses, Square, Book of Wisdom, a sword, bread on a paten, wine in a glass, honey in a small cup, an incense burner, an incense boat containing a mixture of Frankincense and Benzoin, mixed before the ceremony by pulverizing these odiferous resins, a seventh part of niter, and the same amount of poplar wood charcoal, purchased at the drugstore. This is created to allow the creation of a large flame at the time of the ritual fumigations. Moreover, four tall candelabra are placed at the four angels of the altar, each furnished with a large wax candle.   1 0 6 The term ‘louveteau’ has been retained here. It translates as ‘wolf-cub’ and refers to the son of a Mason. While the term ‘lewis’ is used in English Masonry, the concept of ‘louveteau’ is slightly different. A ‘lewis’ has the right to be made a Mason at 18, and if there is more than one candidate that night, he is initiated first. The ‘louveteau’ ritual is performed upon the son of a Mason when he is around 12 – 14, and is a form of Masonic adoption by the Lodge of his father. Ambelain uses the term ‘baptism’, but ‘adoption’ would be a more accurate and less contentious term – PV. 1 0 7 Il y assistera seulement, en tête de la Colonne du Nord, afin de s’en pénétrer .

Then he succinctly explains the purpose of the solemnity and invites all the Brethren to bring the meditation and attention which are required. The Worshipful Master , assisted by the Master of Ceremonies , move towards the altar, makes a tour and returns facing the East, with the altar before him. WM : – Sublime Architect of All Worlds, You who have created by Your Thought and Word the Heaven and the numberless World which revolve or flame in the immeasurable Firmament; You who have created Man has made him the Steward of the whole Universe; throughout the works with which You have surrounded him, You have inscribed the Law of Progress and Love. Which should serve as his guide in the way to ultimate Happiness to which You wish him to aspire. It has been given to us, Masons of the Land of Egypt, to understand this sublime Law, and we faithfully assemble this day to render a new homage to You, by joining today to the cult of Truth a child whom we love and son of one of our Brothers. Deign, O Supreme Architect, to let a ray of Your infinite wisdom descend upon us, so that our teachings and our vows might be the expression of Your supreme will. May this ray be represented by the Fire which lightens our Altar ( the Master lights the coals in the Casserole which his on the Altar; a flame a flame rises up when the Master throws sacred incense upon it three times ) and may the Purity of which it is the emblem extend over us and over all those who have come to this Temple, to render homage to Your Law.

Make them purified and sacred, these produce of the earth with which Your goodness favors us and which adorn this Altar, so that they may so become symbols of our Hope.

The Worshipful Master returns to the East, and at that moment there is a lively knock at the door. The Wardens inform the Worshipful Master , and he asks: WM : – What noise makes itself heard outside our Temple?

Deceived by false illusions, the man sees happiness consisting of vain riches and futile honors. And the Demon of Envy stirs him against all those who are honored and considered by their fellow men because of personal merit. Soon come seductions of all kinds which teach him that only things which flatter the senses and passions are beautiful, pleasant and good. Then, absorbed by everything which gives him vain satisfaction or palpable enjoyment, the man falls back on himself, only loving, appreciating, seeking thing which satisfy his own desires, and content his whims.

But, raising our eyes and our thoughts, we, Masons of Ancient Egypt, the secular earth of the Mysteries and Holy Initiations, we see a Star which flames rising in the East of the World, symbol of Charity and Hope. It signifies to us that Evil will not be forever; that Pride, Egotism and Envy are not destined to reign over men. Already, great victories have been won against them. And the time announced by our Master, Hermes Trismegistus, in his astonishing prophecy, will come: “And when all these misfortunes will have come, when all these terrifying things will have been accomplished, O Asclepius, then He who governs the Unity of the World, the Eternal Architect, seeing the customs and the actions of men, will correct these ills by an act of His Will and His Goodness. He will restore the World to its primitive beauty, so that the Universe will again appear worthy to be admired, and a concert of praise and benedictions will again celebrate the Master of Works Who has created and restored so beautiful an edifice.

Masons of Old Egypt, carry before you the Flame of Truth; above all teach and practice Virtue, and in its turn Good shall reign here below. Brothers of the Column of the South, why have the Masons of Egypt come together? SW : – To contribute to bring the reign of Good to earth. WM : – Brother Junior Warden, how do Masons of Egypt work to realize this Great Work? JW : – By using the pure and gentle ways of persuasion and example. WM : – Brother Senior Warden, what should be the object of Masonic teachings? SW : – They should teach the pure morals summarized in these words: “Do not do to another that which you would not wish to have done to you. Be to him that which you would have him be to you.” Applying the principles arising from these two maxims, we consider all mankind to be our equals and our brothers. We work unceasingly to combat pride, error and prejudice. We fight against ignorance, the principle source of ills in the world. We recommend reciprocal justice, by means of which the rights and interests of each are preserved; tolerance, which leaves all men master of his thoughts; patience, which allows the suffering against which just efforts remain impotent, to be endured with resignation. We love all men without distinction, the rich and poor, the weak and strong, the wise and ignorant, to the level which they voluntarily and consciously contribute to the common good. We hasten, with all our power, to the aid of the unfortunate and the afflicted, and with all our strength we combat tyranny, intolerance, egotism and bad faith. To our eyes the only goal to achieve and preserve, above all else, is the esteem and love of our fellow men; honor and virtue which give infinite joy to conscience, the only ones worthy to be tasted by Masons spread across the Universe. WM : – Brother Junior Warden, what are the indispensable qualities of Masons? JW : – Courage, which leads to victory; perseverance, which ends in triumph over obstacles; devotion, which leads to accomplishing Good, with no expectation of recompense other than that of the witness of conscience."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"144 WM : – Brothers who are, today and henceforth, Sponsors of this boy, you know the evils which desolate the profane World; you have been reminded of the work of Masonry, and you were then told the qualities indispensable to true Masons.

He gives him Wine to drink: WM : – May this Wine, symbol of Strength, give your soul the courage to resist adversity and seduction, as well as the easy road. May it impress a fervent and lasting desire for Good, and for Wisdom and Intelligence, these two privileges which were the purview of our Grand Master, Pharaoh Ramesses II. He throws the Perfume/Incense into the Censer three times and makes the flame leap up each time: WM : – As it has been for centuries, in the heart of the Sanctuary of Memphis, the Sacred Fire dances before the Lord of Eternity; so may the Sacred Sire and the scent of this perfume grow and reign forever over your lower matter.

Remember that to work is to pay your debt to your fellow man; and that the idle man who does not, steals bread which isn’t his from Society.

The second is found in the just satisfaction of physical needs.

May he acts thus, and may this Bread be shared in your name, my Son, between those who support you today. May this communion endure as a living example of the Fraternity and Solidarity which should unite all Men. He breaks the Bread into five pieces, on the Paten, and offers a piece to each of the Sponsors, the Louveteau, and to the Senior and Junior Wardens.

RITUAL FUNERAL SERVICE TEMPLE LAYOUT The Lodge is hung with black drapes with silver fringes. The altar, columns and platforms are also covered with black drapes. On the front of the black cloth covering the altar a skull and crossbones are painted in silver. On the drapes silver tears and identical skulls and crossbones are similarly painted. The Lodge is lit by twenty-seven yellow wax can dles, placed in nine groups of three, as follows: ! three in the East, by the Worshipful Master, ! three in the North-East, by the Secretary, ! three in the South-East, by the Treasurer, ! three on the Column of “Wisdom”, ! three on the Column of “Strength”, ! three on the Column of “Beauty”, ! three in the West, by the 1 st Warden, ! three in the West, by the 2 nd Warden, ! three set back, before the Brother Tiler. The ensemble laid out thus makes a Masonic Square (the three central Columns) in the middle of a Geomantic figure which Geomanticians in former times called “Carcer” (Prison), or “Feretrum” (Coffin). In the center of the Lodge, in place of the floorcloth, framed by the three Columns, a catafalque covered in black and white is set up. At the head of this catafalque stands a black broken Column, on which one can read, in the order of their death, the Brothers who are lost. At the top of the truncated Column, which is three cubits high, is placed a urn in ancient style. At the foot of the catafalque, towards the West, and at the foot of the altar, towards the East, in front of the bottom step, are placed two Censers with lit charcoal, and the Master of Ceremonies will have placed by him an incense Boat with Frankincense and Myrrh. The Brothers are dressed in black ties and white gloves, and their aprons reversed to the “mourning” side. OPENING OF THE WORKS The Works are opened first on the Grade of Apprentice, but the ritual dialogue is stopped when, from their platforms, the two Wardens have given the Worshipful Master the assurance that all the Brothers seated in the Lodge are good and true Masons.

WM : – My Brothers, according to the words of our Master, Hermes Trismegistus, a time will come when Egypt will be empty, the widow of men and of the gods.

We are bound to fulfill those ritual duties which all the Living owe to those who have preceded them to the Eternal Orient.

Funeral music. WM : – Brother Master of Ceremonies, please invite two Brothers from the Column of the North to join with you, in lighting the Mysterious Light on the Funerary Column, that emblem of purification by Fire.

RITUAL FOR AN OPEN “WHITE” MEETING PREPARATION OF THE TEMPLE The Temple is only lit by electric lighting; the Columns are in place, with no candles, in their places around the floor cloth. At the intersection of their diagonals is a small table covered by a blue cloth. On this cloth, arranged side by side are the three “Jewels” of the Lodge and the Sacred Book (if there is one). A candlestick with a new candle is placed behind these Tools, and a sword is placed in front and across the cloth, on the Sacred Book (if there is one). All are covered by a blue cloth.

The three-branched candelabra is ostensibly furnished with new candles, as are those of the two Wardens, but only the electric lights are switched on. If the Sisters normally wear ritual robes, they can wear them to this meeting. Like the Brothers they wear white gloves.

OF MASONIC JUSTICE Extracts from the Great Constitutions and General Regulations , reviewed and approved during the Grand International Conference of 1933, held in Brussels, and defining the constitution and prerogatives of: THE GRAND SCOTTISH TRIBUNAL OF THE 33 rd DEGREE Article 14 . – It will act as Grand Tribunal, Court of Appeal and Final Arbiter. As Grand Tribunal, it presides over offenses of the 2 nd Category (art. 334) attributed to Brothers invested with the 30 th and 89 th Degrees. Article 18 . – Moreover, it delegates its administrative and judiciary powers to the Supreme Council of the 33 rd Degree for everything concerning the administration and surveillance of Lodges of the 1 st to the 33 rd Degree. This Supreme council also forms the Scottish Tribunal, which presides over offenses attributed to Members of Lodges from the 1 st to 29 th Degrees (art. 334). Article 334 . – Offenses are of two categories. The first class includes: intemperance, coarse or inappropriate conversation held in a loud voice, Masonic insubordination accompanied by serious circumstances, and regular lapses of discipline in the Lodge room. The second class includes: all which might degrade Masons or Freemasonry, such as violation of Masonic obligations, clandestine conferral of Degrees, illegal retention of metal objects, books, registers, documents, collars and other objects belonging to a Lodge or to the Order, duels (brawls) between Masons on being witnessed, attempts as schism, leading to the disorganization of a lodge, the formation of a clan, cabal, and all secret machinations intended to influence a ballot, falsify testimony, etc., deliberate prejudice brought against the reputation of another, calumny directed against a Brother, and finally, anything which is considered infamous to the social order. Moreover, article 208 of the Interior Regulations of Lodges says that: “In the case of a Brother forming secret connections, either to form a party, or to influence a ballot, or to encourage division, he is to be excluded in perpetuity, with the Higher Lodges being notified and their advice obtained.” RITUAL OF MASONIC “DEATH” “The Crime does not know how to remain unpunished..” (Ritual of the IX th Degree) The Ceremony takes place in the Mother Lodge of the Condemned.

The Terrible Brother goes to the East to receive the name of the Condemned from the Grand Master, written in reverse in red letters on a white paper triangle, each side a hand span in length. He places it beneath the lit Candle, which he stands upon the Rough Ashlar, and destroys it with the blow of the Gavel.

As this is an important sentence I have reproduced it here in case my translation is not completely accurate. The troublesome words are in bold . I checked with a Francophone friend of mine and they agreed if it meant body, the term corps would be used: véhicule tends to indicate body, soul and spirit. This is worrying because it surely indicates that this is a curse, in that as the person’s name and spiritual light is extinguished, so shall it be done to their person. While Masonry is not exactly a powerful magical vehicle, it is now evident why there is a frequent insistence in the ritual of not doing this with any hate in the heart, else this could turn into a most ugly rituals. I would certainly not commend this ritual to anybody to practice in real life. – PV."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"161 Grand Master : - Since the day is growing dim, night begins, and the Powers of Darkness are climbing up the Valleys of Below, the first phase of Justice has been accomplished, the second phase is in train, and the Tribunal of Holy Vehm can retire.

Complementary Note. – In all Rites and Observances, the Grand Master or the Grand Commander, by tradition and in conformity with the Constitutions , can transmit the three first Degrees of Masonry to a profane, or the High Grades to a Mason, by virtue of their function and under their sole responsibility. Likewise they may, each in his own purview, pronounce a suspension or exclusion, by applying the inverse privilege, and that from the instant that an offense is demonstrated without possible contestation.

Beyond this are the degrees constituting the Sovereign Sanctuary of the High Grades . These rituals were first published by a Lodge of our Rite at Geneva, in its internal Bulletin. They are taken from a manuscript dating from the beginning of the 19 th Century, perhaps 1820. Nevertheless, the Rite of Mizraïm , or Rite of the Egyptians , constituted in 1788 in Venice by Cagliostro among a group of Socinian Protestant, initially used those of the Egyptian Rites of Cagliostro, then those of the Scottish Rectified Rite , then those of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite , with which they had very strong ties until the end of the 19 th Century, when they were once again independent, and not linked to the Rite of Memphis. So far as these rituals are complete, and where they lack detail, Lodges of Memphis-Mizraïm desirous of practicing them, and where there are no details, may refer to common Masonic tradition.

When he has returned, the WM says: My Brother, to you is confided the august function of submitting the Neophyte to the physical proofs, to conduct him in the mysterious journeys, and to make him traverse the four elements through which he must pass before arriving at the gate of the Temple. Firstly, have him write his testament so that we shall know the manner in which he will dispose of the gifts which God has distributed to him. Select a Brother who will watch over the Neophyte while you come, after each journey, to give us an account of his progress in the mysterious route of his purification. Go, my Brother, and may Almighty God be with you. The Expert leaves. He returns a short time later carrying the Neophyte’s testament. The WM reads the contents, as well as his profession of faith or his responses to the following three questions: What is the first duty of man? What is the second duty of man? What is the third duty of man?

If he has replied well, the WM says: Return to the Neophyte, take him from the earth and the shadows of death; deliver him to the Terrible Brother who will have him make the 1 st mysterious journey and make him traverse the second material element; then come to give us an account of this first journey. The Expert leaves and fulfills the orders of the WM. He takes the Recipient from the Cabinet of Reflection, asks him if it is indeed his intention to be received as a Freemason, if he has the courage to endure the proofs to which he must deliver himself. After he has replied, he should be prepared so that his feet are bare (with slippers); then he is given to the Terrible Brother who attaches an iron chain to his feet and hands. The Terrible Brother leads him on the first journey which takes place in complete silence. Then he conducts him to the Reservoir of the second element and makes him cross the water in which the chains should remain. On leaving this, the Expert receives him and says: Sir, what reflections do you have of the place into which you were first conducted, and the journey which you have just made? After his response, the Expert continues: The place in which you were shut in represents the center of the Earth from which all comes and to which all must return. There you found all the images of Death to remind you of the man who wishes to enter among us must first die to vice, error and base prejudice, in order to be reborn to virtue and philosophy, the objects of our cult and of our works; that he must always be ready to sacrifice his life for his Brothers; at the same time it taught you the fate which awaits those who among us become perjurers to their obligations and betray the secret of the Order. The obscurity into which you are now plunged, the state of nakedness in which you have been placed, the metals of which you have been carefully deprived, the metal chain which bound you when you began the first journey, and which you lost when crossing the waters are other emblems which I invite you to in grave on your memory and which, later on, will be explained to you if you persist in being admitted amongst us and in continuing that which you have so courageously begun. After the Recipient's response, the Expert comes to give account to the Brethren of this first journey in the following way: by addressing himself to the Brother JA, who repeats this to the SA and he to the WM. The Neophyte has completed his first journey; he has traversed the second material element in which he has begun his purification, and he has passed through delivered from the chain of prejudices with which he was weighed down. The WM says: Does he consent to continue his journey?"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"173 The Expert replies: Yes, WM, he so wishes. The WM adds: Brother Expert through your kind care, have him make the second journey in which he must pass through the first pure element (Fire). The Expert leaves and goes to execute the orders of the WM. The Terrible Brother seizes the recipient again and after many turns, he hasn't passed through the region of Fire. After he has left this, the Expert says to him in a strong voice: What do you ask of us? Do you consent to continue your path? I warn you that new dangers await you, that they agreed to and those which you have endured up till now. After his reply, the Expert continues: The image formed about us in the world is false. We are represented as united by vague and ridiculous motives, you have been led to think that futility was the link which for so many centuries has assembled the wisest men from all groups society and in so many different conditions. We have been called enemies of society: yet you will find among us friends who are the most ardent for their country and its most loyal support. We have been painted as a society without religious principles: yet religious morality is the foundation of our Order. If we admit honest men from all religions among us, it is because it does not belong to us to scrutinize consciences, and because we believe that the incense of virtue is agreeable to Divinity in whatever manner it is offered. The tolerance we profess is in no way the result of impiety; but only that of indulgence and philosophy. Moreover, all discussion relative to political and religious opinion is completely forbidden among us. Finally, we have been represented as a society of gastronomes: you are going to know the drink which serves as our meal ( he gives him the Bitter Cup ). Thus cup is emblematic, as all which your have experienced up till now. Do you consent to continue on your path? After his reply, the Expert goes to give an account of the second journey in this manner: The Candidate has penetrated the third element, and has passed through purified. He has drained the Cup of Bitterness, and persists in his resolution. The WM says: Since he persists in his resolution, my Brother, please have him make the third turn of the Wheel, so that he might complete his purification in the second pure element. Then you will abandon him to himself, so that the Almighty may lead him and so that His will might be accomplished. The Expert leaves and goes to execute the third journey, during which the Neophyte journeys through the realms of Air in the middle of lightning, thunder, hail and other meteors. After the most terrifying storm comes the most profound calm, after which the Expert says to the Neophyte:"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174 N... , you have passed through conqueror of the four elements, and I abandon you to yourself. Follow your path alone, and if you have the courage and steady will, the Almighty will lead you, I sincerely hope, to the place to which you must come. There he leaves the Recipient to wander alone for a short time. He is close to the door of the Temple where two Brothers in white robes and armed with Swords await. One of them says: Where are you going? What do you want? Have you fulfilled the conditions required to be admitted among us? After his reply, he is told: Do you know that to enter into our Order one must be joined by a terrible obligation, which is for us, in this life and in the next, a guarantee of your discretion? This obligation is not contrary to the obedience you owe to the government of your country, not to your religious beliefs, not to your honor. Do you consent to take it? ( After his reply ) These are its principal points: (1) Absolute silence on all that you will see, hear and learn among us. (2) The obligation to practice the virtues which emanate from Divinity; to combat the passions which dishonor man and degrade him; to aid your Brothers will all your means, even if it may cost you your fortune and your life; to be faithful to your God and to your sovereign, and to give an example of obedience to the laws of your country. (3) Finally, to conform to and to obey the Statues and General Regulations of Free and Accepted Masonry, and to the decrees of the absolute Sovereign Grand Master, of the Supreme Authority of the Rite of Mizraïm, and to the particular rules of this Lodge. Do you consent to take this obligation? After his reply, the Brother says to him: Since you consent to all this, I am going to request the favor of your admission to this Temple: but first reflect on this, for once you have entered, there is no return for you. After his reply, the Brother knocks three times as a Neophyte three loud, irregular blows on the door of the Temple. The JA says: Brother SA, there is in the regular knock at the door of the Temple. The SA repeats the announcement to the WM, who replies: my Brother, see who is the mortal who is so audacious as to dare to come and disturb our mysteries. The SA asks the JA. The JA asks the Expert: Who knocks? The Expert without answers: it is a free man of good morals who wishes to be received a Mason."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"175 (The JA and SA repeat this). The WM says: Ask him his name, his age, his civil status and if it is indeed his true wish to be received a Mason. (His order is executed). Then the WM says: ask him how he has come to the parvis of this Temple which is inaccessible to the profane? The JA and SA repeat this question; to which the Expert replies: he has renounced the world; he has penetrated the centre of the earth and the domain of death; he has followed all the paths of life and has been purified by water, by fire and by air; he has been freed of the bonds of prejudice and the stains of vice. The JA and SA repeat this; after which the WM says: Let him enter the Temple. Rise my Brothers, and come to Order. When the Recipient has entered, the doors are closed noisily, letting the noise of the bolts be heard. The WM says: Be seated, my Brothers, then he addresses the Recipient, saying: Q – Who conducted you here? – Where were you first taken? – What ideas did the aspect of this place give rise to in you? – Where were you next conducted and what happened to you? After his successive replies to each of these questions, the WM adds: All these journeys were so many emblems which will shortly be explained to you, when the light has shined in your eyes and you are permitted to understand the language of wisdom and ancient philosophy. It remains to me, Sir, to put some questions to you, the answers to which will determine the decision the members of the society will take on you. Q – Do you believe in a Supreme Being? (Response). This belief gives honor to your heart and your reason; it is the basis of true philosophy and if some man doubts the existence of the Almighty, it is because he fears His justice. Q – What is virtue? (Response). (It is the habitual disposition of the soul which tends towards doing good). Q – What idea had you formed of our society before presenting yourself to us, and what is the motive which makes you wish to be admitted?

This silence, Sir, proves the interest which you have inspired in the Brethren, who wish to end the period of trials. The purifications through which you have passed will therefore be the only ones to which you will be subjected; may they leave in you no stain, and may all your actions be henceforth directed by this maxim of divine wisdom, the first law of Masons: N EVER DO TO ANOTHER THAT WHICH YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE DONE TO YOURSELF ; AND DO TO YOUR NEIGHBOR THAT WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE HIM DO TO YOU .

Receive this apron ( he puts it on him ) which we all wear and which the greatest of men and even the greatest of sovereigns have deemed an honor to wear. It is the emblem of work and gives you the right to sit among us; you must never present yourself here without being clothed in it. (He gives him the white gloves) Never sully the whiteness of these gloves by soaking your hands in the quagmire of vice, or in the blood of your Brothers, other than in defense of your country. They should ceaselessly recall the engagements you contracted before your admission to this Temple of virtue. ( H e gives him the woman’s gloves ) These are destined for the woman you most esteem, convinced that a Mason cannot make a choice unworthy of himself. My Brother, henceforth this is the only title which you will receive, and which you will give in Lodge. To recognize one another, we have signs, words and grips. ............................................................................................................ I have already told you, my Brother, that Masonry is known throughout the universe; howsoever it is divided into many Rites, its principles are the same and you must show the same sentiments towards Masons whatever Rite they might belong to. The WM embraces him three times and says: Now go, my Brother, to be recognized by the Brother Expert. The MC conducts him to the West to give the signs, words and grips. After they are given the Brother Expert says to the JA: Brother JA, the signs, words and grips have been faithfully given by the new Initiate. The two Assessors repeat this successively; then the WM proclaims the new Brother in his quality as a member of the Lodge, and says, after giving a knock which is repeated by the two Assessors: Rise and come to Order, my Brothers. PROCLAMATION To the Glory of Almighty God, in the Name and under the auspices of the Sovereign Grand Council-General of the 90 o and last Degree of the Masonic Order of Mizraïm and of its four series, the Supreme Authority for France, sitting in the Valley of Paris; I proclaim Very Dear Brother (first and last name) henceforth and forever a member of this Worshipful Lodge in the Grade of Apprentice, and you are invited, Brothers S and JAs, and all of you, my Brothers, to recognize him in the aforesaid quality, and to give him aid and assistance according to his needs. After the Proclamation, the WM gives a knock and says:"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"179 Brothers S and JAs, invite the Brethren seated on your respective columns to join with us in welcoming the happy acquisition which the Order and the Lodge have just made in this new Brother and new friend. The S and JAs repeat the announcement. Then the WM says: With me my Brothers, give the sign. The sign and ordinary battery are given together with the WM. The MC joins the new Initiate to aid him to reply in like manner. Then the WM says: My Brother, please be seated at the head of the column of the North, which is the place occupied by the Apprentices. May you merit by your assiduity towards the work and by the practice of the Masonic virtues which the Obligation has imposed upon you and, and which your Brothers will show you by example; may you indeed merit the opportunity to penetrate further into our mysteries and receive the favors which Masons never refuse to Brethren who show themselves worthy. When the new Brother is at his seat, the WM says: Be seated, my Brothers. Then he adds: The Brother Orator will give you an explanation of all the emblems which accompanied your reception. Give these your most careful attention, my Brother. The emblems conceal the most important truths and upon their understanding depends all the light which you are going to be called upon to acquire. ORATOR’S DISCOURSE My Brother, A short time ago a narrow band of cloth covered your eyes, and you were plunged into the most profound darkness, ignorant of the place where you had been conducted, not even knowing the individual into whose care you were entrusted, your spirit assaulted by the proofs to which you had submitted yourself, and which succeeded one another with alacrity. Your soul was uplifted, I am sure, by the explanation which was given you concerning some of these mysterious emblems, in order to help you read yourself – to some extent – in the Book of Wisdom, and you were only supported in this harsh journey by the tranquility of a good conscience, by your perseverance and by an absolute trust in the Brother through whom we have the good fortune to have you. This trust honors both of you; and the knowledge of his qualities which we have gained gives us confidence in the ones we now find in you. Finally, the blindfold has now fallen for you; the clearest light shines in your eyes; as you are as yet unaccustomed to its brightness, they are still dazzled by it. The state from which you are emerged, the multiplicity of strange objects with which you are surrounded, the very brightness of this place which you were far from expecting and"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"180 which must have seemed even more alive because you emerged into it from a long period in profound darkness; all this must have given you a strong sense of confusion which I am going to endeavor to disperse, by giving you the keys to our emblems. These emblems are connected to points of history in man. Before explaining these to you, I am going to explain the origin of our institution, which will unfold its purpose, and which will make its mysteries more clear. The ardent and restless spirit of man is constantly led towards the supernatural. His senses need to be stimulated, and the most sublime truths only come to his soul with difficulty unless they come by means of these intermediary deceivers. In vain did philosophy and experience try to convince man of the infidelity of such messages; but the common herd did not receive or listen to them, for they only wanted to hear these messages. This was the origin of all error, and all superstition. When from the very cradle of human nature, fanaticism and superstition disguised under a thousand forms inundated the earth with their grievous and criminal errors, the pure and simple cult of the author of nature was abandoned on all sides was only preserved by a small number of Sages uniquely gifted with the Knowledge of nature and the worship of its author. They lived on the banks of the Nile, in the land of Mizraïm, the principal place where this precious deposit, this sacred fire, was preserved. It was from there – and all nations attest to this – that all the sciences and all the arts came forth. It was there that all the Sages of all nations went to be instructed. It was from there that they brought back to all the nations, with the light of the spirit, the flame of reason and justice. Yet the empire of error was such that they were never able to reveal this openly to the eyes of the common herd, and the truth was only and remained forever the portion of a small number of men who were known by the name of initiates. Egypt was, perhaps more than any other country, a slave to superstition and fable. Ingenious emblems, invented before writing to teach the people all that was useful for the preservation of his Being, and astronomical indices to govern the works of agriculture, became to the people so many Divinities presiding over objects for which these claimed Divinities has originally been the symbols. From this arose the errors of polytheism and the multitude of bizarre Divinities in which these people believed. What should the true Sages do to ensure they were not dragged along by the current? Gather themselves together, as it were, and only communicate their high knowledge to proven men, upon whose virtue, illumination and discretion they could count. It was therefore necessary to devise proofs, mysteries, and various degrees of initiation proportionate to the illumination and moral faculties of candidates. In their own countries foreign initiates propagated the Mysteries which, as in Mizraïm, everywhere comprised the importance of one God; the practice of virtues – particularly beneficence, which most closely brings man into the presence of his author; to study nature and to learn its secrets. Moses, Orpheus, Pythagoras and Thales were such Sages, who communicated these important philosophical truths to their disciples, and who perpetuated them in Greece, Italy, as far at Northern France, but above all in the East, where they were most carefully preserved."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"181 And this is why, my Brother, these truths have been transmitted to us through emblems, which reveal themselves to the profane in the longest time. These explanations should have explained to you the majority of the trials to which you were submitted, and I will recall them to you succinctly, while telling you to observe that they were the same proofs which were adopted by the initiates of Egypt. Before learning truth, man is slave to error and prejudice. This was indicated by the darkness into which you were plunged and the chain which you wore. The journey you undertook is the emblem of the life of man drawn from nothing by Almighty Divinity, and set aside by his author for the highest destiny. This, my Brother, is the support and hope of virtue which is so often persecuted in the earth. You were led out weak and naked from the grossest element, and you passed successively through the four elements. They represent the several ages of life and the difficulties which multiply in the steps of those who work towards their moral perfection. In the last part of this journey you presented a serene front towards the furies of the storm: such is the Sage, my Brother, strong from the witness of his conscience. He fears neither the fury of the wicked nor reverses of fortune; he submits with resignation to the almighty will of Divinity, knowing that there is no greater happiness than virtue, no greater ill than to turn away. It is ever the same when confronted by adversity, as in the middle of prosperity; it was the philosophy of Horace that the very fall of the universe would not frighten him. “Si fractus illabatur orbis, impavidum ferient ruinae 1 1 5 .” No doubt such was the disposition which you have brought among us, my Brother, and such was our conviction that we lightened the rigor of the trials, and lessened their length which, at the time of the Egyptians, lasted for three years before they arrived at the first part of their initiation. From this comes the emblematical age of an Apprentice, which is three years old, and the respect we have for the number three which contains still more mysteries which perseverance and assiduous labor will make known to you. Here, my Brother, my task ends and yours begins. You have taken the first step on the path of truth; the light shines in your eyes, and the road which remains for you to follow should not frighten you; you will always find your Brothers ready to level all difficulties which lie before you. A great many great and sublime truths still remains for you to know; redouble you zeal to learn them, for you are worthy of the prize you seek. After the Orator’s discourse, the WM circulates the Zedaka (or trunk of beneficence) as well as the Bag of Propositions. The WM then says:   1 1 5 Should the heavens crack and tumble down, as the ruins crushed him he would not fear."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"182 Brothers S and JAs, asks you respective columns of any Brother asks for the Bag of Propositions (after the response, he makes the same demand for the Zedaka). After the reply, he continues thus: Brothers S and JAs, ask your columns if the Brethren have any proposals to make for the good of the Order in general or this Lodge in particular. If so, they have the floor. (The Assessors repeat the announcement). The WM says: Brother Secretary, please read the draft of the minutes. After they have been read, the WM says: Brothers S and JAs, ask your columns if any Brother has an observation to make in the reading of the draft of the minutes which the Secretary has just read. The announcement is repeated by the two Assessors and the WM approved the draft following the response. When there has been an initiation, the WM gives a knock and says: Please rise and come to Order, my Brothers. Before parting, let us give thanks to the Almighty for the works of this day. PRAYER Father of the Universe, Eternal and Fruitful Source of light, knowledge virtue and joy, full of gratitude for Your infinite goodness, the workmen of this Temple give you heartfelt thanks and present to You every good, useful and glorious action they have taken on this solemn day, in which they have seen the number of their Brother grow.

Q – Are you a Mason? A – My Brothers recognize me as such. Q – What is a Mason? A – A free man or good morals, equally a friend of rich and poor, if they are virtuous. Q – What are the qualities necessary to become a Mason? A – The first is purity of heart. Q – What is the second? A – Blind submission to the procedures prescribed by admittance. Q – What were the procedures used in your reception? A – I was first introduced by a virtuous friend which, since then, I have recognized to be a Brother, then conducted by unknown people to a room adjoining the Lodge where, after asking me if my intention was truly to be received as a Mason, I was enclosed in a secret place. Q – What did this place represent? A – The center of the Earth and the abode of death, which was to teach me that all comes from the earth and must return there; that man must constantly be in readiness to appear before the Supreme Judge; that profane who wish to be received as a Mason must, above all, renounce all vice, only to live henceforth for virtue; and finally, to recall this truth: that just as the earth is made of inert matter, or the grossest of the elements which"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"184 compose the Universe, and that it is through this which the emblematic journeys commenced, so we must submit and purify the matter within ourselves – that is to say the body – in order to dispose ourselves to purify the spirit – that is to say the soul. Q – What did you do in this place? A – I wrote my profession of faith, after which a Brother placed me in the state in which all profane who aspire to become a Mason must be put. Q – In what state were you placed? A – A strip of cloth covered my eyes; I was neither naked nor clothed and I was deprived of all metals, except a heavy chain which weighed me down. Q – Why were your eyes bandaged? A – To represent the shadows of ignorance in which live all men who have not seen the light. Q – Why were you neither naked nor clothed? A – To express the state of frailty of man, who is slave to prejudice and error. Q – Why were you deprived of all metal and loaded down with a heavy chain? A – Metals are the emblem of vices, and by this I learned that one must renounce them in order to become a Mason. The chain was the symbol of the prejudices which I had to shed, as happened at the first point of my purification. Q – What were you made to do in this state? A – I was made to undertake a long and painful journey. Q – What did this journey signify? A – Besides a literal sense, which was that of my purification and preparation to receive the important secrets which would be confided to me, it also offered a moral sense which represented all the vicissitudes of human life, from birth to death. Moreover it had a physical and mysterious sense which presented an image of nature, and gave Sages the key to all the secrets and high knowledge. Q – Where did this journey lead you? A – To a salutary pool from which I emerged freed of the shackles which weighed me down. Then a friend explained part of the truths hidden beneath the emblems of this first journey."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"185 Q – What did you do then? A – After receiving assurance that I persisted in my resolution, this Brother had me continue my path. Q – What obstacles did you suffer? A – An ardent furnace was before me and I was constrained to cross it. Q – What did this furnace signify? A – The violence of passions, the fieriness of youth, which are some of the many obstacles to the moral perfection of man. Q – What did you do after passing through this third element? A – A Brother handed me a bitter liqueur, emblem of the sorrow and disgust which man experiences in this life, and which the Sage endures without complaint. Then he invited me to continue on my journey. Q – What did you experience on this third journey? A – I was placed in the region of Air: lightning, hail and meteors raged about me, and finally this terrifying tempest was followed by the deepest calm. Q – What did this tempest signify? A – It portrayed the troubles which test man during his mature years and towards the end of his life. Q – What did you do then? A – My guide left me to continue my path alone, and I found myself at the door to the Temple. Q – What did you find there? A – Two Brothers who stopped me, and having assured themselves that I had passed through the middle of the elements, they taught me the obligations which I would have to contract; after which they had me give three loud knocks.

Q – In what position did you take it? A – Standing on the third step of the altar, right hand upon the Bible and a Sword, and the left holding the point of a compasses upon the heart. Q – What did the WM then do? A – He granted me the Light. Q – What did you see at that moment? A – The three sublime lights in Masonry, the Sun, Moon and Master of the Lodge. Q – What connection was there between these two stars and the Master of the Lodge? A – As the Sun rules the day and the Moon the night, so the Master presides over the Lodge to enlighten it. Q – What did you then see? A – Three precious objects, emblems of all our duties. Q – What were these objects? A – A Bible which contains our duty to God, a trunk destined to receive the help it is our duty to give to our Brothers, and a Sword to recall the punishment which awaits perjurers. Q – What did the Master of the Lodge do then? A – He had me advance to the East and repeat my Obligation; after which he gave me the signs, words and grips of the grade of Apprentice Mason.

Give me the first letter, and I will give you the second. Q – B. A – O. Q – A. A – Z. Q – BO. A – AZ. Q – What does this word signify? A – Strength. Q – What did the WM then do? A – He clothed me in a white robe, emblem of innocence, gave me gloves of the same color and recommended me never to sully their purity; then he had me recognized by the Brother Expert and proclaimed me Apprentice Mason in the Rite of Mizraïm. Q – What do you understand by this word Mizraïm? A – It is the name which writings give to the first son of Ham who, at the time of the division of the World, went to establish himself on the banks of the Nile, where he founded the kingdom of Egypt, also called Mizraïm in the Scriptures. Profane history gives the name of Menes to this grandson of Noah. Q – What link is there between Egypt and Masonry?

Q – Who compose a Lodge? A – Three govern it, five compose it and seven make it just and perfect. Q – Why are these three? A – The WM and his two Assessors. Q – Why do you say that three govern it? A – Factually, because three Masons were employed in the construction of the Temple of Solomon. Figuratively, because man is composed of a body, a soul and a spirit, which is the intermediary or the link which unites the two others. Q – Why do five compose it? A – Because man if gifted with five sense, three of which are essentially necessary to Masons: Sight, to see the sign; Touch, to receive the grip; and Hearing, to hear the word. Factually they represent the five lights of the Lodge. Q – Why, finally, do seven make it just and perfect? A – Because there are seven principle Officers in a Lodge, and because this number contains great and sublime mysteries. It represents the union of three principles to the four elements; it alludes to the seven days that the Almighty used at the creation of the Universe, figuratively represented by the seven years which the construction of the Temple took. It recalls the seven celestial spheres, to which correspond the seven days of the week, the seven perfect metals, the seven basic colors and the seven harmonic tones. Finally, the properties of this number are such that, according to the Sages, it reigns over the universe. Q – Why doesn’t this mysterious progression commence with the number one? A – Because unity is not a number, but the generator and principle of all numbers; emblem of perfection and the Almighty. It represents uncreated Being, while the numbers in the Masonic series recall His sublime works, that it to say, the marvels of creation. Q – What form is your Lodge?

The Master of Ceremonies replies: It is I, conducting an Apprentice who asks to pass form the perpendicular to the level. The WM says: Ask him his name, his age and his civil and Masonic qualities. When this request has been satisfied, the WM continues: How does he dare to conceive the hope of receiving this Grade? The Master of Ceremonies replies: Because he is free-born and of good morals.

A – A sage friend whom I have since recognized as a Brother. Q – In what state were you presented in Lodge? A – Neither naked nor clothed. Q – Why, my Brother? A – To make me understand that luxury is a vice which is essential to the vulgar, and that a virtuous man must trample all sentiment of vanity and pride underfoot. Q – Why were your eyes covered with a bandage? A – So that I might discern how the shadows of ignorance and the profound night of passion are prejudicial to the happiness of man. Q – Why were you made to go on a journey? A – To teach me that it is never on the first step that one comes to virtue. Q – What did you see when your eyes were uncovered? A – All the Brothers armed with swords, whose points were aimed at me. Q – What did this action teach you? A – That they were ready to shed their blood for me if I was faithful to the obligation which I had just contracted, as they were to punish me if I was so contemptible as to violate it. Q – Why was a compasses placed at your naked left breast? A – To show me that the heart of a Mason must be just and true. The WM continues: MY Brother, you have five journeys to make.

The WM says to the Candidate: My Brother, this journey represents the period of a year, during which a Companion must be employed in perfecting in the cutting and dressing of stones which he learned to hew in his apprenticeship, with the aid of the mallet and chisel. This emblem shows you that despite the perfection that an Apprentice should have, he is still far from completing his work; that the raw materials given over to the construction of the Temple which he is raising to the Almighty, and of which he is both the matter and the workman, is still not built, and that he cannot dispense with the hard and painful work of the Mallet, and the precise and attentive use of the faithful chisel which must never stray from the line which was drawn by his Masters.

The crowbar, replacing the compasses, is an emblem of Power which adds to our individual strength the knowledge to do and perform that which, without their aid, would be impossible for us to execute.

When he has made the tour of the Lodge in this manner, the Master of Ceremonies announces that the journeys are ended. The WM says to the Recipient : The fifth and final journey teaches that, sufficiently instructed in manual practices, the Companion must employ his time, during this last year, in the study of the theory of art. Learn from this, my Brother, that is it not sufficient to be on the road of virtue to be able to maintain it. Strong efforts must be made to achieve perfection.

When this is done, the WM shows him the Blazing Star, and says: Consider this mysterious star and let its memory never be effaced from your soul. It is the emblem of the genius which rises up to higher things, the symbol of this sacred fire of which the Almighty has made us the depositories, and by means of which we might identify, love and practice the true, the just and the equitable.

The 1 st Assessor gives a knock and says: VW Brother 2 nd Assessor, and W Masters who are seated on the column of the North, please make your observations on what has just been read to you, or agree to the Reception of the Candidate with the customary marks of approval. After the Masters in the North have made their observations or given their assent, the 2 nd Assessor gives a knock and says: W Masters who are seated on the column of the South, please make your observations on what has just been read to you, or agree to the Reception of the Candidate with the customary marks of approval. (A moment later:) VW Brother 1 st Assessor, silence reigns on the column of the South. The 1 st Assessor says: VRM, silence reigns on both columns. Then the VRM says: W Brother Master of Ceremonies, please go to the parvis of the Lodge and see if there are any visitors. (See the First Degree ritual). The visitors are introduced. The VRM says: VW Grand Expert, the reception of the Candidate has just received the unanimous approval of the Masters of this Worshipful Lodge. Please repair to the Candidate and prepare him for the high favor which is about to be done to him. The Grand Expert leaves and goes to the Candidate. Then the VRM says: W Master Architect, please make the customary preparations in the Temple. The sacred fire is carried into the Temple. In the middle of the room is placed a coffin covered with a mortuary drape. At the head of the coffin is a square and, at the feet, an open pair of compasses.

A white shroud covers the body from the feet to the waist, apron raised up to the lower lip, the rest covered with a white cloth stained with blood. When these arrangements"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"207 have been completed, the lights are extinguished with the exception of a spirit lamp which burns on the altar of the VRM. PREPARATION OF THE CANDIDATE He should be without shoes, arms and breast bare, with a small square hanging from the right arm, a cord three times around the waist. A Companion’s apron is worn and his eyes are bandaged. WORKS OF RECEPTION While the Candidate is approaching the Middle Chamber conducted by the Grand Expert, the latter tells him with affectation that consternation seems to reign in the Lodge, that until then nothing has been learned about the cause of a grief which has been manifested by frightening signs, that he presumes a great misfortune has occurred, that in this case the reception could be delayed for some time; but finally that he should still present himself and try to gain entrance. When they arrive at the parvis of the Lodge, the Grand Expert leaves the Candidate under some pretext, telling the Candidate that his absence will no be for long. He immediately returns quietly enough not to be heard, stand by the door of the Lodge a few paces out of the way, but close enough to see all that happens. At this juncture the 2 nd Expert comes and knocks slowly nine times on the door of the Temple. The door is opened, the deepest silence reigns among the workmen, nine blows of a horn answer the nine knocks by the 2 nd Expert. The door remains ajar. The VRM, after giving nine equal knocks, repeated by the 1 st and 2 nd Assessors, says: W. Brother 2 nd Expert, have you at last discovered tracks of the murderers of our Illustrious Grand Master? Will justice be done? Must we weep without rest? Will the blood which cries out for vengeance be satisfied swiftly? The 2 nd Expert replies: My searches have been fruitless, but we must not lose hope. Let us unite our efforts, and the murderers of Hiram will not escape us, despite all the care they have taken to conceal themselves. Then the VRM repeats: Let us unite our efforts, my Brothers, and the murderers of Hiram will not escape us...copy me, my Brothers. He descends from the altar and approaches the sacred fire. All the Master arrange themselves around him. Then he says in a loud voice: Hiram is no more! (The Assessors"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"208 repeat these words). Infamous murdered have taken him from. Let our tears freely flow, my Brothers... Hiram is no more (the Assessors repeat: Hiram is no more!), irreparable loss, this death has ravished what we left most dear and precious! Who will lead us in the works of the Temple? With Hiram, my Brothers, we have all ceased to be. Hiram is no more! (The Assessors repeat: Hiram is no more!). Let us purify the profaned heart of a Temple which has cost us so much sweat and let us swear to avenge the murder of Hiram (All the Brothers says: We so swear)... Great Being, Almighty Being, You Who Are Who You Are, You who from Your Heart sees and judges the nations of mortals, do not condemn our just indignation! If the sorrow we endure lead us to sacrifice to the memory of Your most worthy adorer the monsters who have ravished us, it is not so much our vengeance as a homage which we render to supreme perfection. Everyone returns to their seat., after which the VRM give nine slow knocks which the Assessors repeat. Lugubrious music is then played, succeeded by profound silence. The door of the Temple is closed. Then the Grand Expert approached the Candidate who has until then been left alone, and tells him that he is going to ask for his initiation from the Master. He takes him by the hand and give nine knocks at the door of the Temple. The 2 nd Expert opens the door and asks: Who is there? The Grand Expert replies: It is a Companion who has completed his time and who seeks initiation into the secrets of the Masters. The 2 nd Expert repeats this response to the 2 nd Assessor, who transmits it to the 1 st , and he says: VRM, the Grand Expert is in the parvis of the Temple, conducing a perfect Candidate, who seeks initiation in the secrets of the Masters. (The door is left half-open, and it not closed until the Candidate has entered). The VRM says: Why does the Brother Grand Expert come to distract our sorrow? Our plaints and our moans should have warned any Companion, a Brother belonging to a class which we suspect of deserving this just title, to keep far from this place. But perhaps this Companion is one of those who has caused our grief; perhaps the justice of God has marked him out for our justice. Brother 2 nd Expert, take the Brother Preparer, and bring four armed Masters – Go! Seize this Companion, inspect him thoroughly. Examine his hands, and check his clothing carefully. Remove the aprons he is wearing and bring it to me. Finally, ensure that no trace which might indicate the horrifying crime which has been committed can be found upon him."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"209 The Candidate is brusquely grabbed, and examined from head to toe. His apron and the bandage covering his eyes are removed. The 2 nd Expert returns into the Temple which the apron and blindfold. The Candidate remains in the parvis with the Brother Preparer and the four armed Masters. The 2 nd Expert says: VRM, I have executed your orders but I can find nothing on the Candidate which indicates that he has committed a crime: his clothing is white, his hands are pure and the apron I have brought to you is without stain. The VRM says: God willing I was in error and the Companion is not one of those whom we must pursue. However, my Brothers, if he was innocent and not ignorant of our sorrow, nor of the funereal events which have taken place, why would he have chosen such a dangerous time to present himself here? Was he not afraid that we would suspect him and would turn against him? My Brothers, introduce him into the Temple, that we might interrogate him. No doubt his answer will teach us what we should think of him. Do you agree, my Brother? (All give the ordinary sign of approbation). Then the VRM says: Brother 2 nd Expert, since this Worshipful Assembly has mind to introduce the Candidate, ask him how he dares to hope to be admitted among us. The Grand Expert asks the Candidate to reply with the password. The VRM continues: By the password! This audacious response confirms me in my suspicions. By the password!... How could he know it if it was not as the result of his crime? See, my Brothers, unequivocal proof of his culpability – and yet his temerity seems inconceivable. VW Brother 1 st Assessor, please go to the door of the Temple and examine this Companion once again, with even more scrupulous attention. The Brother 1 st Assessor goes to the door, examines the Candidate, looks at his hands and cries: Heavens! It is him! Then he returns and says: VRM, I have incontrovertible proof of his crime: his hands are stained with blood. Then the VRM give nine knocks and says: There is no more doubt as to his crime. This Companion is one of those who we mist punish. It is possible he is one their accomplices and has come here to spy on us. Let him enter, and those so watch him should not leave him for a moment. Let them stand with him in the West and may all the entrances which lead here be carefully guarded. All of them stand in the West behind the Candidate, who has been led into the Temple, and whom the Brother Preparer leads by a cord. The VRM speaks to the Recipient thus: Companion, you must be either foolhardy or indiscreet, if you truly are not guilty – and I still doubt that – to present yourself here at a"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"210 time when your comrades are with good reasons suspect. The marks of sorrow and consternation which you see on our features, the mourning which surrounds us, the sad mortal remains in this coffin, all will tell you that we are lamenting a death. If this death has been the result of the course of nature, we would weep, it is true: but then we would not have a crime to punish and a friend to avenge. Companion, are you involved in this horrible outrage? Are you one of those who have committed this? Answer! He is shown the body enclosed in the coffin. The Candidate replies NO. The VRM says: Make him walk around this room. Perhaps the sight of our tears and our despair will reach his heart, and lead him to repent and confess his crime. While the Candidate is being led on his journey and while his back is to the coffin, the Master who was placed in it in such a manner a not to be seen by him is removed. The Master of Ceremonies takes the Candidate by the hand, the Brother Preparer behind him, holding him by the cord, the four armed Masters escorting him, all lead him around the Lodge. He is led behind the VRM, whose shoulder the Master of Ceremonies has him knock five times (OOO – OO). The VRM turns and asks: Who comes here? The Master of Ceremonies replied: A perfect Companion who has completed his time and asks to sit in the Middle Chamber. Q – How does he dare to hope for this? A – By giving the password. Q – How can he give it, if he knows it not? A – I will give it for him (he gives it). Then the VRM says to the Recipient: Pass Tubalcain! He leads him to the East. The VRM says: Lead the Candidate to the altar. He is led to the East by the three steps of Apprentice, then the five of Companion, and from the West to the East by the nine steps of Master. On arriving at the altar, his right hand is placed on the Bible, and his left holds an open pair of compasses whose points are applied to each breast. (See the Apprentice ritual). OBLIGATION"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"211 I, N... , of my own free will, in presence of Almighty God, and this Worshipful Assembly, solemnly promise and swear on the Sacred Book of Law, and on my honor, never to reveal the secrets of Master Mason which will be confided in me, to conform to and obey the decrees of the absolute Sovereign Grand Master of the 90 o and final Degree, and to the orders of this Worshipful Lodge.

And finally, I renew my previous Obligations, and undertake to fulfill them on pain (here the VRM give a knock of his gavel, and all the Brethren rise and come to Order) of having my body severed in two parts, one in the South and one in the North, my entrails burned, and their ashes thrown to the winds, so that there might no longer remain any trace of me; and God keep me in my Obligation. Amen. Amen. Amen. The VRM, after examining him in the secrets of the Apprentice and Companion, and when he has given him the sacred word of this final Grade, says: Brother JAC... , you are going to represent the greatest man on earth, the Mason and our W. Master Hiram, who was killed before the completion of the Temple of Solomon. All the Lodge members come together around the coffin. The 2 nd Assessor stands in the West and the 1 st Assessor in the East, both carrying their gavels in their hands. The VRM in the East, carrying his gavel, continues: David, King of Israel, formed the plan of building a Temple to the Almighty. To this end he amassed great treasures, but having strayed from following the path of virtue, and thus rendering himself unworthy of the protection of the Grand Architect of the Universe, this glorious undertaking was reserved to his son Solomon. Before undertaking the construction of this edifice, this Prince sought the participation of the King of Type, who sent him Hiram, the famous architect. Solomon, recognizing the virtue and talent of Hiram, tasked him with drawing up the plans of the Temple, and gave him management of the workmen. The undertaking was considerable, and the number of workmen was in proportion with this. These men were divided into several classes, and their salary was in line with their expertise. The Apprentices, Companions and Master, among others, had a word of recognition, so they could receive the salary allotted to them. The Apprentices assembled at column B... ; the Companions at column J... ..; and the Masters in the Middle Chamber. Fifteen Companions, seeing the Temple was almost completed, and because they had not obtained the Master’s word, because the time was not yet completed, resolved to obtain it by force from W Hiram at the first opportunity, so that they might pass themselves off as Masters in other countries. However, of these fifteen Companions, only three persisted in their designs. Their names were: HAHEMDATH, HAGHEBOUROTH and HAKIBOUTH. These three Companions knew that Hiram came each day at midday to pray in the Temple, while the workmen rested, and placed themselves: Hakibouth at the Southern gate, Hahemdath at the Western gate, and"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"212 Haghebouroth at that of the East; and there they awaited for Hiram to present himself when leaving the Temple. Hiram firstly directed his steps towards the Southern gate, where Hakibouth asked him for the Master’s word. Hiram told him that he could not give it to him on his own, and that besides, it was not in this manner that he should ask for it: he should wait patiently until his time was due. Hakibouth was not satisfied by this response and inflicted a blow with his ruler across his throat. Here the Recipient is led to the 2 nd Assessor, who seizes him and says: Give me the word of Master . The Recipient replies No. Then the 2 nd Assessor inflicts a blow with the ruler across his throat, after which the Master of Ceremonies conducts the Candidate to the 1st Assessor. The VRM continues: Hiram fled to the West Gate, where he found Hahemdath, who asked him the same question, and on the refusal he received from him, dealt him a violent blow with an iron square with which he was armed. The 1 st Assessor, after saying to the Candidate: Give me the Master’s Word , and when he has replied NO, gives him a blow with the square on his left breast. After this he is conducted to the VRM, who continues: Hiram, shaken by the blow he has just received, dragged himself to the East Gate, where he hoped to find a free exit to escape, but there he was again stopped, this time by Haghebouroth, who made the same demand, and on receiving the same response dealt him such a terrible blow on the forehead with his mallet that he fell dead at his feet. The VRM gives the Recipient a blow with the gavel on his forehead and gives him a shove. Two Brothers are behind him to catch him, and they lay him in the coffin and cover him with a black drape, instructing him to hold a Tamarisk branch in his right hand. The VRM continues: The three assassins met to ask each other for the Master’s Word, but finding they had been unable to obtain it, and in despair fro having committed a pointless crime, devoted themselves to erasing any trace of it. So they picked up the body of Hiram and hid it under the rubble. That night, after enclosing him in a chest, they went to inter him at the foot of a Tamarisk tree a short distance from Jerusalem. The disappearance of Hiram had caused panic among the constructors of the Temple. Solomon had them make close searches, but in vain. Then the twelve Companions who had abandoned the criminal plan to take the like of the Master, suspecting the truth, presented themselves before Solomon wearing white gloves and aprons, to stand for their innocence, and informed him of what had taken place. The king immediately sent these twelve Companions to search for the Master, and told them that if they succeeded in finding him, and if he was dead, to remember the first words and first signs which were then made articulated. By giving them this order, King Solomon who feared that the Master, in the pains of agony and hoping to protect himself from death, may have let"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"213 escape the words and signs of Mastership, had the intention of substituting them with the first signs made and the first words pronounced on seeing the cadaver. The twelve Companions made around five days of fruitless exploration and gave account to Solomon, who then sent nine Masters for the same object. These nine traveled to Mount Tabor, and on the second day, towards evening, one of them who was fatigued by the excesses of the journey and the heat of the day went to sit at the foot of a Tamarisk tree. Noticing that the soil beneath him had been freshly moved he dug down, and soon a chest appeared which he opened easily, and in which he saw a cadaver. He called his comrades and included them in this sad discovery. It was the body of the Master who had been assassinated, and not daring out of respect to push further in their search, they covered the hole and in order to recognize the spot, the tore off a branch from the Tamarisk which they planted above it, after which they went to make their report to King Solomon. This prince judged that it could be none other than his Grand Architect Hiram, and was covered with the keenest sorrow. He ordered them to go and exhume the body and bring it to Jerusalem. The Masters clothed themselves in their white gloves and aprons, and on the second day, having returned to Mount Tabor, saw to the raising of the body accompanied by his widow in tears. My Brothers, let us imitate our ancient Masters and, like them, attempt to raise the remains of our unfortunate Master Hiram. All the Masters rise and follow the VRM, who makes two tours of the coffin. On arriving at the right of the Recipient, he takes the Tamarisk branch and then says: We have arrived at the place which holds the body of Hiram. This Tamarisk branch is its sinister indicator. The soil indeed appears to be recently disturbed. Let us confirm our worst suspicions. He draws back the drape which covers the body of the Recipient, and at the same instant he makes the Sign of Horror, and says: ADONAI! ADONAI! ADONAI! All the Brethren do the same, and the VRM continues: This is truly the body of our unfortunate Grand Master. My Brothers, let us carry out the sorrowful duty imposed upon us by Solomon, by exhuming this worshipful cadaver. The VRM takes the Candidate by the index finger of the right hand, giving him the grip of Apprentice and says: B... Then he gives him the grip of Companion and says J..... MAKBENA, then he takes him by the wrist and with the aid of the two Assessors who are at his sides, he raises him by with Five Points of Perfection, pronouncing as he does so the sacred word MOHABON. The VRM returns to his altar, and the Assessors and Brethren return to their seats. The Recipient is told to go to the altar and renew his Obligation."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"214 I, N... renew the promise which I have already made, never to divulge the secrets which have and are about to be confided to me.

INSTRUCTION Q – VW Brother 1 st Assessor, whence came you? A – From the West, VRM. Q – Where are you going? A – To the East. Q – Why did you leave the West to go to the East? A – Because light appears first in the East. Q – What are you going to do in the East? A – To seek a Master’s Lodge. Q – Are you a Master? A – All Masters recognize me as such. Q – Where were you received? A – In the Middle Chamber."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"215 Q – How did you get there? A – By a staircase in the form of a spiral, composed of 3, 5 and 7 steps, and passing from the square to the compass. Q – What preparation did you submit to at first? A – Two times nine days, before that fixed for my reception, to assure myself that no part of the veil remained before my eyes, which people helped me to tear away in the preceding initiations, I was posed questions whose solutions to which were attached my admission or rejection. Nine days later my replied were sought to these nine questions, and finally on the day arrived for my reception, I was taken to the parvis of the Temple, eyes blindfolded, arms and breast bare, a square suspended from my right arm, and deprived of all metal. Q – What was done with you in this state? A – I was conducted by the Brother Grand Expert to the door of the Temple and left for a moment alone. Q – What did you hear? A – Moaning and groaning; talk of mortal remains, justice, fruitless searches and terrifying silence which ruled from time to time and was only interrupted by lugubrious and prolonged sounds. Q – What happened to you then? A – The most profound calm followed the dolorous crisis which I had just heard, when the Brother Grand Expert came to find me and told me that he was about to ask for me to be initiated into Mastership. Q – How were you introduced? A – By nine slow knocks. Q – What were the formalities used in your reception? A – After the nine knocks had been given at the door of the Temple, I heard a voice which asked: Who is there? The Grand Expert replied for me that I was a Companion who had completed the time required for initiation into Mastership. Q – How were you introduced? A – By the password."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"216 Q – What did you do when you entered? A – A tour of the Lodge. Q – Did nothing happen to you? A – I experienced an obstacle behind the VRM. Q – What was done with you? A – I was made to walk to from the South to the West by 3 and 5 and I arrived by 9 in the East, where I took the solemn Obligation of Masters. Q – What was done with you when you were Obligated? A – I was made to represent our Worshipful Master Hiram who was killed before the completion of Solomon’s Temple, then conducted to the VRM and to the 1 st and 2 nd VW Brother Assessors who made the same request and was hit in the same manner as Hiram when Hahemdath, Haghebouroth and Hakibouth assassinated him. Q – What happened to you next? A – After giving me the final blow I was laid out on the earth. Q – How were you raised? A – By the Five Points of Perfection. Q – What are they? A – Right foot against right foot, right hand in right hand, left hand behind the back, knee against knee, and breast against the Master’s breast, which was tiled. Q – What is the hidden sense of the emblem of this grip? A – Foot against foot signifies that one must always be ready to run to the aid of one’s Brothers. Hand to hand, that one will assist them in all their needs. Left hand behind the back, that one will support them with all one’s strength. Knee to knee, that one should bow incessantly before the Supreme Being. Finally, breast to breast, that one must never divulge the secrets of which one is the depository.

A – (The VW Brother 1 st Assessor gives the sacred word and the password to the VW Brother Grand Expert, who then says: They are correct, VRM.) Q – How many signs of recognition are there in total? A – Seven outer signs, VRM: three signs, two grips and two words. Q – Why the number seven, my Brother? A – It is the number of physical and moral perfection, and it is by this latter that one may recognize a Master Mason. Q – From all that you have said to me during the course of this instruction, would this not mislead one into thinking that the institution of this Master’s Degree only dates from the time of King Solomon?"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"218 A – Its institution is from a much earlier time. It is true that from this epoch Masonry suffered great changes, that the Grade of Companion was instituted, and that from that time only did it take the name Masonry: but he basis, he doctrine and the customer are the same and have never varied. Q – What are the changes Masonry experienced from this epoch, and what were the motives that determined them? A – The Egyptians, in perfecting the sciences entrusted to them by the Sages of Chaldea, placed them in emblems which were bizarre to the vulgar eye, but sublime to the eyes of hose who possessed the knowledge. Moses was initiated into their mysteries, and from them this great legislator formed the highest concepts, and resolved to establish them within the privileged tribe. He put this enterprise into execution, and Mount Sinai was witness to the 1 st Initiation, underpinned by a religious respect for the ingenious emblems with which the Magi had enveloped the Sublime Moral and Physical Truths, and he guarded against any change being made to them. His successors showed the same reserve, and it was not until he reign of Solomon that an indiscreet person, whose name is lost to history, let out the secret of the Order’s symbols. This excited the murmurs of a blind populace who saw in them signs of paganism. Fearing for the Order, the Initiates asked advice from King Solomon about substituting new hieroglyphics for those preserved from the Egyptians. Solomon approved their prudence and after lengthy conferences, its was agreed that the ancient hieroglyphs would be replaced by the images of instruments proper to material construction. Q – How do the new emblems differ from the ancient ones? A – The majority of Egyptian hieroglyphs showed animated beings sometimes formed from parts belonging to creatures which were strongly dissimilar in their external forms and inclinations, and numeric and geometric combinations which also resulted in hieroglyphs. Numbers three, four, seven, nine and the generator ONE were the most respected emblems. The triangle was a sacred hieroglyph; the circle was the symbol of eternity; and the cube represented strength. The Masonic hieroglyphs are the same with this difference, however: the animated symbols are replaced by images of mathematical and stone-masonry instruments. Q – What did the Master’s Grade mean to the Egyptians? A – The same in its basis, and the majority of details. The allegory is for us, as it was for them, moral regeneration, under the emblem of physical regeneration. All regeneration follows an ending, and all ends are brought about be destructive principles. Thus Hiram (that is to say Purity of Life) is slain by Hahemdath, Haghebouroth and Hakibouth, Hebrew names which signify: pride, ambition and cupidity. In their era it was Osiris (Existence) who was killed by his brother Typhon (a name which means torrent) or rather, as understood in the symbolic sense, the disintegration of matter to bring about a new succession of forms. This disintegration was expressed by the number 9. Typhon"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"219 committed the crime with 72 accomplices whose number added to that of 9 led to the disaggregation of matter, giving 81, the product of this addition and the multiplication of 9 by 9 and symbol of the eternal regeneration of beings. Q – What is Masonry? A – The knowledge of nature and its laws. Q – What is a Master Mason? A – A man exempt from weakness and vulgar prejudice, whose sole aim is moral perfection, for whom the only path is a continuous regeneration of the soul – that is to say, a constant and scrupulous attention to combating degrading passions and the vices inherent in the human species. Q – Where is he to be found? A – Between the square and the compass. Q – How many Brothers make a Master’s Lodge perfect? A – Nine, meaning the VRM, the VW Master 1 st and 2 nd Assessors, and six W Masters. Q – Why do the three first Officers carry gavels? A – To remind us constantly that, just as matter gives forth sound when struck, so we should be sensible to the cries of virtue and to the benefits of the Almighty. Q – On what do the Master work? A – On the Tracing Board. Q – Where do they receive their wages? A – in the Middle Chamber. CLOSING The VRM gives a knock and says: Please rise and come to Order as Masters, my Brothers, to close the works. Q – W Brother 2 nd Acolyte, what is your place in the Lodge?
