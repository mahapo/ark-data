His earliest comments re fl ect a type of sympathetic indi ff erence, and reveal that he did not yet know how specious they actually were.

Marco- nis de Negre, Grand Hierophant. He conferred it upon a number of Masonic Brethren, and establis hed a Supreme Council,  th Degree with John Mitchell at its head.

Both these Brethren are Members of “The Supreme Council for the Northern Jurisdiction of the United States, at New York,”-which claims to be the regular Council for that Jurisdiction. If these Brethren have not sworn never to receive or recognize any higher degree in Masonry than the  d, they are not  ds.

I append to this Address a true account of the origin and progress of this Rite of Memphis, taken from the Masonic Monthly published at Boston, and which, from investigations long ago made by me, in translating documents connected with the history of Free -Masonry in France, I can vouch for as true. Those who now manage the Rite and sell its degrees, in New York, publish that it is recognized by the Gr ∴ Or ∴ of France. But this is false, in the sense in which it is intended to be taken; an d in selling degrees and titles by means of it, the vendors are obtaining money under false pretenses. On the  th of April,  ,Grand Master Marshal Magnan addres sed a cir- cular to the dissenting Lodges and Masons of ’ France, inviting them to return to their allegiance. Marco nis seized the opportunity to apply for the a ffi liation of his Rite with the Gran d Orient. His request was granted, and two new Lodges were soon after constituted. Yet, alth ough the Gr and College of Rites thus admitted the Rite of Memphis, this admission was accompanied with such restrictions th at the Rite, in fact ,exists no long er. Deprived of it s consti tution, its government, its Councils, its entire organiza tion, and its  degrees, permit- ted only to work in the three Symbolic Degrees, subject to the prescriptions of the Grand Orient as regards the obtaining of the higher degrees, the Rite of Memphis is actually transfor med into the Scottish Rite. A member of a Lodge retaining the de nomination of the Rite of Memphis, is not permitted to add th e number of his high degree of that Rite to his name, nor to wear any jewel or decoration belong ing to it. As to its work in the Blue Degrees, it in no respect materially di ff ers from the old printed Rituals of the Scottish Rite, of which, as well as the Rite Moderne, any one can buy as many as he plea ses in Paris. Of course, the successors of those who invented the Rites of Mizraim and Memphis have the right to work them. But all Masons ought to be informed that they are mere shams, used only for the purpose of making money, by those who vend the degrees; communicating no usef ul information; as worthless as the tinsel and sp angles of the Circus; and most of the degrees being absolutely nothing but idle word s and signs.

APPENDIX . ————— DOCUMENTS REFE RRED TO IN THE ADDRESS OF THE SOV ∴ GR ∴ COMMANDER. ————— the rite of memphis. In a work entitled “ The Sanctuary of Memphis ,” b y J . E . M a r c o n is, the author, who styles himself the founder of the Rite in question, thus brie fl y gives an account of its origin. “The Rite of Memphis, or Oriental Rite, was introduced into Europe by, Ormus, a seraphic priest of Alexandria, and Egyptian Sage, who had been con- verted by St. M ark, and reformed the doctrines of the Egyptians in accordance with the principles of Christianity.” “The disciples of Or m us continued, until  ,to be th e sole guardians of ancient Egyptian wisdom as puri fi ed by Christianity, and Solo monian science. This science they communicated to the Templars. They were then known by the title of Knights of Palestine or Bret hren Ros e-Croix of the East .In them,the Rite of Memphis recognizes it s immediate founders.” In de fi ning the object and intention of his Order, Marconis speaks as follows: “The Masonic Rite of ’ Memphis is a combination of the an cient mysteries; it taught the fi rst men to render homage to the Deity. Its dogmas are based on the principles of humanity its mission is the study of that wisdom which serves to discern truth; it is the bene fi cent dawn of the development of reason and intel- ligence; it is the worship of the qualities of the human heart, and the repression of its vices; in fi ne, it is the echo of religious toleration, the union of all belief, the bond between all men, the symbol of the sweet illusions of hope, preaching the faith in God that saves, and the charity that blesses.” Thus it will be seen that this Rite, which purpor ts to be it continuation of the Ancient Mysteries, and pretends to cont ain a vast amount of instruction, does but announce the aim and mission of modern Free-Masonry. And yet its founder is the fi rst to disobey th e precepts which it enjoins; for one of the prin- cipal duties of these adept’s is to be always scrupulously truthful; while his work is but a mass of misrepresentations and fi ctions, invented by him for the purpose Vo l u m e ,   The Sp urious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"of imposing upon th e credulity of others. The introduction to his book above quoted a ff ords one proof; th e continuation of his recital will furnish others: “The Rite of Memphis is the sole depo sitory of high Masonry, the true prim- itive Rite, the Rite par excellence, which has come down to us without any alter- ation, an d is consequently the only Rite which can justify its origin and the combined exercise of its rights by cons titutions, the authenticity of which can- not be question ed. The Rite of Memphis, or Oriental Rite, is the veritable Masonic tree, and all system s, whatsoever they be, are but detached branches of this institution, venerable for its great antiquity, and born in Egypt. The real deposit of the principles of Masonry written in the Chaldee language is pre- served in the sacred Ark of the Rite of Memphis, and in part in the Grand Lodge of Scotland, at Edinbu rgh, an d in the Maronite Convent on Mount Lebanon.” To t h i s e x t r a c t we subjoin the fi rst article of th e organic Statutes of the Order, from which the rest ma y be readily imagined: “Bro ∴ Marconis de Negre, th e Grand Hierophant, is the sole consecrated depository of the traditions of this Sublime Order.” After this it would certainly be super fl uo us to ask, what are the Constitutions or what are thos e precious documents in the Chaldee language that are “preserved in the sacred Ark of the Rite of Memphis?” The fact is, that they never existed, except in the fertil e imagination of the inventor of the Rite. It is but the same old story, the same language, the same tactics which Masonic charlatans have for a century and a half made use of, in order to make partisans and victims. As regards the introduction of the Rite in France, Marconis de Negre informs us, that a certain Samuel Honis, a native of Cairo, brought it from Egypt, in  (how or from whom he received it, we are not informed), and in company with Gabriel Mathieu Marconis (father of Marconis de Negre), Baron Dumas, and the Marquis de la Rogne, founded a Lodge of this Rite at Montauban, on the  th of April,  ;that this Lodge wa s closed oil the  th of March,  (why, we are not told); and that in consequence the archives were con fi ded to th e care of the father of Marconis, who was appointed (by whom it is not stated) Grand Hierophant of the Order. The falsity of these assertions is easily demonstrated. Jacques Etienne Mar- conis was initiated into the Rite of Mizraim, at Paris,  st of April,  ,being then twenty-seven years of age. On the same day he received the fi rst thirteen degrees of the Rite, for this Egyptian ladder was not very di ffi cult to ascend. On the  th of June of the same year, certain charges were preferred against him by several of the Brethren, in consequence of which he was excluded from the Rite. Shortly afterwards left Paris and went to Lyons, where, under the name of Negre , he founded a Lodge of the Rite of Mizraim, with the title of “la Bienveillance,” of which he assumed th e Mastership. As Master of that Lodge, lie was elevated to  Heredom Albert Pike & Wi lliam L. Cummings"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the  th Degree, by the supreme Authority of that Rite, that is to say, by the Bros ∴ Bedarride, wh o little imagined that the Bro ∴ Negre and the Bro ∴ J. E. Marconis, whom they had pr eviously expelled, were one and the same person. It was not long , how ever, before new charges were preferred against him, by the Brethren of Lyons, and on the  th day of May,  ,he was once more expelled from the Orde r. Af te r t h e s e t wo e x pu lsions, Marconis, satis fi ed that he could no longer play a part in the Rite of Mizraim but feeling that he was born for great things, did what many others had done before him—he created a Masonic power! Appropriating the Mizraimite ladd er, manufactured by Lechangeur, and adding a few rounds, he soon construc ted his Rite of Memp his, arid the work being fi nished, he constituted himself its “head and front.” To f u r n i s h a n o r igin and a history to this work was no very di ffi cult task; and in accomplishing it we must acknowledge that he showed much more respect for the common sense of the Masons than did Michel Bedarride who, in his history of the “Order of Mizr aim,” was not satis fi ed, like Lechangeur, to attribute its ori- gin to the Egyptian ki ng of that name, but we nt so far as to ascr ibe it to the Deity Himself. Marconis only da tes hi s Rite from the commencement of our era, hop- ing, probably, that this modesty on his pa rt might induce Ma sons to a ccept it without distru st, and to put faith in those precious documents written in the Chaldee language, which, he informed them, were to be found in the sacred Ark of the Rite of Memphis. Marc onis was, in reality, poss essed of considerably more erudition than the manufacturers of the Rite of Mizraim; and in constructing his own system, ingeniously vari ed and transposed the degrees of the former, alter- ing the titles, passwords, signs, etc.; thus in a manner disguising their real ori- gin. Many of his degrees, however, were ne ver completed, and remain to this day degrees merely in name, having no Ritu al, or at best ,mere skelet ons, to be, fi lled up at the pl easure of any speculator who chooses to purchase them. The extrav- agant character of the Rite need hardly be alluded to; the published Constitu- tions, Dipl omas, Edicts, etc., furnish abundant evidence of the fact. This heaping up of such a mass of mystic rubbish, merely for the purpose of constituting and governing an as so ciation of men, the mission of which is “the development of reason and intelligence, and the stud y of wisdom,” is simply ridiculous. In  ,after having compiled the Ritual s of his Rite, Marconis visited Bel- gium as Gran d Hierophant and successor of his father, and opened negotiations for th e establishment of his Order in that country. Meeting with little encour- agement he returned to Paris, where, under the name of Marconis Letuillart ,he succ eeded in gathering together a few isolated Brethren, and instituted a Lodge, “The Disciples of Memphis.” On the  d of March,  ,he constitu ted a Grand Lodge under the title of “Osiris,” which was intended to govern and superintend Vo l u m e ,   The Sp urious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the Subordinate Lodges he expected to create. On the  st of May,  ,he in sti- tuted a Chapter “les Philadelphes,” and on the  th of February,  ,a Lodge “les Sages d’Heliopolis.” On the  th of April,  ,he published th e Statutes of the Order, and fi nally succ eeded in establishing two Lodges of his Rite at Brussels. But about this time he met with a seri o us and unexpected repulse. When he had constituted his fi rst Lodge at Paris, the leaders of the Rite of Mizraim, taking umbrage it this inva- sion of their Jurisdiction, at once wrote to the Prefect of Police, informing him of the expulsion of Marconis, and praying that he might be debarred from con- stituting and holding Lodges. Not obtaining as speedy relief as they expected, they issued a circular addressed to all their Lodges, Chapters, etc., warning them against the machinat ions of Marconis, and setting forth their reasons for his expulsion. The police fi nally interfered, and on the  th of May,  ,all the Lodges of the Rite of Memphis were closed. F rom that da te, until  fi nding “his occupation gone,” he turned his attention to Masonic literature and pub- lished in succession several works, the “Sanctuary of Memphis,” the “Hiero- phant,” the “Mystic Sun,” the “Mystic Temple,” “the Masonic Pantheon,” etc. In  –  ,taking advantage of th e political events of the period, Marconis succ eeded in reestablishing three Lodges at Paris: the “Disciples of Menes,” the “Disciples of Pythagoras,” and the “Disciples of Memphis.” The Belgian and other Lodges he had previously founded, however, “slept the sleep that knows no waking.” During the time that Marconis de Negre managed to keep his Lodges alive, he followed the example of the Bros ∴ Bedarride, by seekin g to procure adher- ents among the members of the Grand Orient and Supreme Council, conferring upon them gratis the highest degrees of his Rite. In  Marconis went to Engl and, and after several attempts succeeded in establishing a Grand Lodge,“Disciples of Menes,” which was intended to be the representative Supreme Council of the Orde r for Great Britain and Ireland. J. P. Berj ean was constituted Grand Master, and Representative of the Grand Hierophant. The feeling which arose in  against Masonry in general, in France obliged Marconis to close his Lo dges, and in December,  ,they for the second time yielded to a feeling of somnolen cy, and “ lay down to plea sant dreams.” The gov- ernment of the Rite was then transferred to the Grand Lodge he had established at London, a nd on the  th of November ,Berjean was sole mnly installed as “Grand Master of Light” of the New Mystic Temple, and of the General Grand Council of the Order, being at the same time appointed “Agent of the Hiero- phant.” The Orde r at that time consisted in London of but so me thirty mem- bers, chie fl y political refugees, among whom were Louis Blanc and a few other  Heredom Albert Pike & Wi lliam L. Cummings"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"men of note. These, how ever, soon retired and their places were taken by a class of men who, in the course of a few year s, became so turbulent and unruly that the Grand Master Berjean was obliged to dissolve the Lodge, and Marconis himself thought it prudent to declare that lie had washed hands of the whole a ff air, and disowned all responsibility relative to the proceedings of the Lodge. Still fondly hopi ng for th e realization of his pet scheme, Marconis, in  , endeavored through Bro ∴ Rebold, the well known Ma sonic author, to negotiate with the Gr and Orient for the a ffi liation with that authority of the Memphisian Lodges. The demand was re jected, and Marconis then again devoted his atten- tion to Masonic publications. In  lie came to New York with an assortment of diplomas, charters, jew- els, etc., for the purpose of propagating his Rite. He ha d some ti me before his arrival constituted, by Deputy, two Chap ters and a Council of his Rite at New Yo r k . O n e o f t h e s e Bodies was composed of “Ame rican citizens of African descent.” A t Troy, N.Y., he instituted a so-called Grand Lodge, “Disciples of Memphis,” of w hich a Bro ∴ Durand was Grand Master. After a brief sojourn in this country, Marconis and his Prime Minister disappeared somewhat sudden- ly, and were next beard of as having returned to Paris. The seed sown by them has indeed sprouted in various places, and still retains a sort of spasmodic exis- tence, but its growth is composed of su ch heterogene o us and antagonistic ele- ments, that it will, i n all probability, soon die a natural death. In London, some of the fragments of the former Grand Lodge afterwards endeavored to revive their organization, and fi nally succ eeded in r e-constituting themselves .This Body is still in existence, but has no Ma sonic status whatever, the Grand Lodge of England regarding them as clandestine Masons, and for- bidding its subo rdinates from hold ing Masonic communication with them. ————— Bulletin du Grand Orient de France Supréme Conseil pour la France et les possessions Françaises Ma rs 1865, pp. 4, 5.

The use of Masonic decorations, indicating degrees above the  d Degree, is, then, not only a violation of the law, but the negation of the principles embod- ied in Articles  and  of the Constitu tion, which places all Masons and all Rites under the level of equality among themselves.

Moreover these Bret hren present themselves as composing the great major- ity of th e Masons of the Rite of Mizraim, and seem not to doubt that their admissio n into the bosom of the Grand Orient will be followed by the a ccession of the whol e body of Masons of that Rite.

The Maso ns of the Rite of Mizraim, like those of the Scottish Rite. are admitted as visitors in the Bodies of the Grand Orient; and when one of them seeks a ffi liation with one of our Lodges, it is granted as if he had been initiated in a Lodge of the French Rite. French Rite, Scottis h Rite, Rite of Memphis, Rite of Mizraim, what do these words signify? In th e dogmatic point of view, in the scienti fi c point of view, nothing, absolute ly nothing.

Very well! We claim for each of these. four Rites the same toleration, and we believe that the Grand Orient owes equal protection to each ...... What is asked of us is the permission to form a, Lodge under the Obedience of the Gran d Orient of France; and we might refuse this permission. But we ought not to do so, unless the applicants are either not Masons or have become unworthy. But those who apply to us are honest men and recognized Masons.

In this fact, which particularly concerns th e Lodge, we see nothing inconvenient for the Grand Orient. We do not see why, when Lodges wo rk, under the protection of the Grand Orient of Fr ance, not only in the French Rite, but also in the Scottish Rite and Rite of Memphis, they may not work in the Rite of Mizraim which is rec- ognized in France, and which, except in its higher degrees, with which we are not dealing, an y more than with those of Memphis, has forms which scarcely at all di ff er from those of, the French Rite. Consequently we have the favour to propose to the Council to authorize the Provisional Lodge peti tioning to constitute itself under the jurisdiction of the Grand Orient, and to work in the three Symbolic Degrees, either in the French Rite or the Rite of Mizraim; but on condit ion that it shall ta ke another distinc- tive name, and shall not use the word Mi zraim, except to indi cate the manner of the work of the Lodge.

S uccess breeds imitation. This statement has never been more fully exem- pli fi ed than in connection with legitimate Speculative Freemasonry, which from its very ince ption after the Revival of  in London, has been beset with imitators rangin g all the way from good-natured mockery to vici o us schemes to dupe the innocent and unwary. The excellent reputation of freemasonry and the quite universal knowledge of its high aims and ideals removes the “sales resistance” which frauds and charlatans would encounter in imitating and promoting a less known fraternal organization. Freemasonr y’s own concerns are, unfortunately, an ai d to those who would fur- ther their own evil ends by duping innocent and well-intentioned individuals by plausible claims of an easy method of admission to an exclusive fraternity. It is only when the zeal of such unscrupulous promoters overcomes their discre- tion that they are halted. Sooner or later some of them run afoul of local ordi- nances, state statutes and occasionally of federal postal regulations, and there is an exposure which becomes general knowledge. The Dari us Wilson frauds in Massac h usetts in  ,and the McBlain Thompson Masonic Fraud Case, tried in Federal Court at Salt Lake City, Utah, in ¹ are striking examples. These very cases furnish evidence on the spurious rites to be discussed in this article. Although the Memphis and Misraim rites have been practically dor- mant for long period ,there are several pa rties who claim more or less doubtful authority over th em, and it is not at all improbable th at attempts may again be made to propagate them in the United States. For this reason we present to the American Masonic Craft, through the columns of the Masonic press, positive evidence of the history of these rites and their illegal and illegitimate nature.

Shortly after the so -called Revival in  ,Freemasonry was introduced from England into France where it became extremely popular. Not satis fi ed to prac- tice Masonry in the origin al form in which it had been transmit ted to them, numero us ritual writers proceeded to devise additional “degrees” of their own, and by  there were several hundred such degrees in existence. ² Such of these as possessed any real merit were cumulated into speci fi c Rites, the most notable of which was the “Rite of Perfection” which was introduced into the Western Hemisphere by Stephen Mori n in  .This Rite,originally consisting of twen- ty- fi ve degrees, wa s afterwards expanded to thirty-three degrees and now con- stitutes the well-known and entirely legitimate Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. This Rite is cont rolled by regularl y organized Supreme Councils, the oldest of which is that for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States of America, organized at Charleston, South Carolina, in  ,to which all legitimate bodies of this Rite can mediately or immediately trace their origin. While in English-speaking countries, with one or two minor exceptions, the fi rst three degr ees of this Rite are never practiced, the remaining degrees being conferred only upon those who have received the symbolic degrees in bodies regularly chartered by Gr and Lodges, in some countries, notably the Latin- American ones, it is almost the only Masonic system known. Origin of the Rites of Memphis and Misraim This article treats of the history of these organizations rather than of their ritu- alistic and allegorical philosophies. For th at reason there is no necessity of dis- cussing the alleged origins of the bodies as set forth in their rituals and lectures. An oriental antiquity is claimed for them which is purely fabulous, and it is amusing to see the variations presented by the self-constituted heads of these bodies when knaves fell out among them selves and drew upon fertile imagina- tions for fanc iful origins. The Rite of Misraim (or Mizraim) is the older of the two, but it takes sec- ondary place in the treatment of them as it became merged with the Rite of Memphis. The two rite s are so similar that their names have become synony- mo us for each other, although the term “Rite of Memphis” is the one best rep- resenting the two rites wh en considered independently. The Rite of Memphis was propagated in the United States, Italy, France, Rumania, Great Britain, Egypt, Germany, an d even South America. In all these countries, with the pos- sible exception of Egypt, where it was more or less active up to a comparatively recent date, it is now nothing more than a name.  Heredom Albert Pike & Wi lliam L. Cummings"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Rite of Misr aim or Mizraim Practically all au thorities are agreed in attributing the origin of this Rite to Milan, Italy, in the year  . ³ The Supreme Council,  °Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for France had been founded in Paris a year earlier, through the activi ties of the Count de Grasse-T illy, who had received the  °in America. About the same time, Germain Hacquet carried to France from San Domingo, W[est] I[ndies], the Rite of Heredom in twenty- fi ve degrees and established a Grand Consistory to govern it, entir ely independent of the Grand Orient of France, ⁴ but had nothing to do with the formation of the Supreme Council. De Grasse-Tilly, in  ,gave the degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite to the principal members of the Grand Orient of France; and after the fall of the Empire a Supreme Council in the bosom of the Grand Orient was organized, which stil l exists ⁵ though now inactive. Legitimate Scottish Rite Masonry in France is now under cont rol of the Supr eme Council  °, which is independent of the Gran d Orient. It has been claimed that the Rite of Misraim owed its principles and form of organization to the Primitive Rite of Philadelphes of Narbonne, which was established in  ,and in  united with the Grand Orient of France. Of this, however, there is no positi ve proof. From certain star tling similarities between this Rite and the Rite de la Sagesse Egyptienne ,concerning which ver y little has ever been published, the originators of the Rite of Misraim may have had a knowledge of and drawn upon the latter for their material. At any rate, they did not hesitate to draw freely upon other rites, and at least fi ve of their degrees were “lifts” from the Ancien t and Accepted Rite. ⁶ The Rite of Misraim originally had eighty-seven degrees, but was soon expanded to ninety. Some writers co ntend that the creation of the Rite of Misraim was the work of the Bedarride b rothers, but this is not the case. The chief originator, or more correctly compiler, of the Rite was on e Lechangeur, who had been refused admissio n into the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and who organized the Rite of Misraim in oppo sition to the former. ⁷ It was, however, the three Bedar- ride brothers, J oseph, Michel, and Marc, the last named of whom perpetuated their memory by publishing a history of the rite in Paris, in  ,entitled De L’ O r d r e d e M i s r a i m ,a two volume work of some  pages, who introduced and propagated the Rite in France, about  –  .There it partoo k of the dissension and schisms which were so indissolubly part of the eighteenth and nineteenth century French Masonic acti vities. Thus pr ecedents were established which the American progenitors observed equally as meticulously in subsequent decades. The Grand Orient of France, which controlled a number of degrees other than the symbolic grades of Ancient Craft Masonry, refused recognition to the new rite. The govern ing body dissolved, but some of the constituent lodges con- Vo l u m e ,   The Sp urious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"tinued their work. They were very natu rally considered as clandestin e bodies and treated as such. The Rite of Memphis In the absence of contemporary docu ments and published accounts, we must rely upon other reco rds for th e origin of this rite. The earliest authentic account ⁸ attributes its beginning to one Samuel Honis, a native of Cairo, Egypt, who, with Gabriel Mathieu Marconis de Negre and others founded the fi rst lodge, Les Dis- ciples de Memphis ,at Montauban,France,in  .Proponents of the Rite admit that this lodge suspended labor the following year, and state that the archives were entrusted to Ma rconis de Negre, Gr and Hierophant, who revived the Rite in  in Brussels and Paris. The French body was styled the Grand Lodge Osiris. ⁹ The Rite of Memphis published its Statutes and Regulations on January  ,  ,and Jacques-Etienne Marconis,Jr.,was named Grand Hierophant,depos- itory of traditions and general archives of the Order. ¹⁰ During  and  several other Lodges were established, among them being the Chapitral Lodge Philadelphis at Paris; the lodges Bienveillance and Sages d’He liopolis in the Ori- ent of Belgium and the Lodge Chevaliers de Palestine ,at Mars eilles. ¹¹ On February  ,[  ]. the Prefect of Police in Paris requested the members of the Masonic Or der of Memphis to cease thei r labors, and on [ May ,  ], the Grand Hierophant declared the Masonic Rite of Memphis at refreshment. They again resumed labor in Paris on March  ,  ,several other lodges being formed in that year, [  ] and [  ]. ¹² Although unrecognized by the Grand Orient which, as supreme authority of French Masonry, held their lodges clan- destine, th e Rite enjoyed considerable prosperity and extended itself into vari- ous part s of Europe and South America. Masonic authorities put a stop to the Rite’s emissaries in Berlin in  , ¹³ but there are ev idences of activi ties in Ger- many in the present century. The trend of political events put the French lodges “to sleep” again on [ December ,  ]. ¹⁴ The Rite in the United States rests upon a foundation which was unsound from the very inception. Th is fact, supported by a de fi nite pronunciamento from the Gran d Orient of France, reproduced herewith in full, must be empha- sized at this point, because the proponents of the Rite very conveniently over- look this important detail when presenting their versions. Its development in this country, however, must be deferred for the moment, but will be treated fully in subsequent paragraphs. Relinquishment of Ma rconis’s Authority Political developments and Masonic opposition in Fr ance caused the activities of the Rite to be transferred to London, whe re the Gr and Lodge of England  Heredom Albert Pike & Wi lliam L. Cummings"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"took cogni zance of it and condemned it in no uncertain terms, as we shall see later. Marconis also visited America, and the Rite was established in New York in  .This,too,will be de alt with in detail. Masonic authority in France was vest ed in the Grand Orient of France. Unlike Amer ican Gr and Lodges, with which we are more familiar, this body controlled rite s and grades other than the symbolic degrees, through a Grand College attached to it. This Grand College of Rites assumed authority over all Masonr y in France, at one time claiming to have the Scottish Rite under its con- trol, and in fl uenced the Scottish Rite develo pments in England and Ireland to such an extent that serious situations arose between those bodies and the two Scottish Rite Supreme Councils in the United States. ¹⁵ Marconis, rightfully believing that his Ri te would have a better status if oper- ated under the aegis of the Gran d Orient, applied to it for recognition. At the same time one of the French Lodges, called Sectateurs de Menes of the Rite of Memphis demanded of the Grand Orient an authorization to work under its jur- isdiction. The Grand College of Rites was consulted and by a decree of Novem- ber  ,  ,admitted the Rite of Memphisinto its bosom.It was required,in order to accomplish this, that Marconis di vest himself o fall authorit y he held up to that time and to deliver the entire Rite and its creations into the control of the Grand Orient. This he did, wh ereupon the symbolic lodges of the Rite in France were recognized and authorized to continue work in the three symbolic degrees; but the higher gr ades from the  th to the  th, inclusive, were shelved. At that time the degrees of Masonr y from the  th to the  rd, inclusive, were under the direction of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, through its chamber in the Grand Orient of France, and auth ority to work them co uld only be obtained from that bo dy. The degrees beyond the  rd in the Rite of Memphis have never been brought legitimately from the darkness into which they were cast by the Grand Orient, when it as sumed control over that Rite. Even the symbolic Lodges of the Rite of Memphis soon abandoned their rituals and adopted the system of the Modern French Rite, so that by  the Rite of Memphis went entirely out of existence so far as any connection with legitimate Masonry is concerned. While the Grand Orient did violate its policies in regard to some other Masonic rites worked in the United States and South Am erica, it never did modify its acts relative to the Rite of Memphis, and that Rite became as dead as the proverbial door nail after Marconis relinqui shed his authority in  . ¹⁶ Introduction into the United States The controversial ex ponents of the Rite of Memphis are agreed upon its origins in the United States, no matter how much they di ff er in the later details.

The growth of the Rite during the period from  to  can be attributed in a large degree to the di ffi culties which existed in the Northern Masonic Jur- isdiction of the Scottish Rite.

The Grand Orient strenuously denies that they ever authorized the practice of any degrees of this rite, further than the third, or that of Master. All authority over degrees above the third was vested in the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, and whatever action the Grand Orient took with the propagation of such degrees was in the name of that Rite and not the Rite of Memphis, all of whose degrees were buried in the arch ives of the Grand Orient from the time that Marconis placed it under their aegis. That Seymour utilized the Rite of Memphis as a money-making scheme is shown by the fact that he gave these degrees in Washington, D.C. without charge except that each who rece ived them should take a diploma fr om him and pay fi ve dollar s for it. ¹⁹ Viewed from the American standpoint, Seymour’s change in the system was obviously an attempt to cr eate a rival body to the Scottish Rite Supreme Council from which he had been expelled. T hat the member s of the Northern Supreme Council considered it as such is evid enced by the followin g notice which ap- peared in newspapers in New York and elsewhere: (Under caption “CARD”): New York ,Nov.  ,  The undersigned members of the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Free- masonry, and attached to the Supreme Council of the Northern Jurisdic- tion by active and honorary membership, claiming their allegiance to that  Heredom Albert Pike & Wi lliam L.

Burt,  °, who had been Deputy Grand Master of the Rite since  ,issued a call May  ,  ,for a conventi on of the Rite of Memphis, at Chicago, Illinois, which met June  ,  .The resolutions adopted by this con- vention read ,in part: And whereas, we have been noti fi ed by the aforesaid Grand Master (H. J. Seymour), that the Grand Orient of France has reduced the degrees to . ... And whereas, we are informed that our worthy and Illustrious Brother and Deputy Grand Master, Calvin C. Burt,  °, has not accepted the change, and does not believ e that such powers exist in the Rite, and that the adoption of such a reduction will be attended with bad results.... Resolved that we will not acknowle dge or subscribe any such reduction of degr ees.... ²¹ A new governing body of the Rite of Memphis was accordingly established with Calvin C. Burt as Grand Master. Meetings were held in  ,  , , and  in various western cities, the records of these meetings showing that sever- al bodies of the Rite had been established and had a considerable membership. ²² Burt, too ,had a rather hectic Masonic care er. He was expelled by the Grand Lodge of New Jersey in  ,charges having be en preferred in  ,but in  the action of the Grand Lodge was rescinded on a purely technical point, name- ly that su ffi cient time had not elapsed between service of notice on Burt and the time of his trial. In  Gran d Master Finch of Michigan issued an edict warn- ing the fraternity of th at state against accepting the petition for a ffi liation of Burt in any Lo dge in that Jurisdiction. ²³ While all this was occu rring the ge nuine Sovereign Sa nctuary of Amer- ica became dissatis fi ed with the conduct of Harry J. Seymour, and the Gran d O ffi cers determined to purcha se him out at a cost of  ,  dollars. Seymour took the dollars, resigned his o ffi ce to the Sovere ign Sanctuary of America, with all patents, charters, rituals, documents and privileges what- soever, and noti fi ed same to the world.

The spurious Egyptian Rite of Memphis, presided over by Ca lvin C. Burt, b ecame dissatis fi ed with their chief, and he (Burt) agreed to sell out to Darius Wilson for  ,  dollars. A small hole-and-corner meeting, the circular of Brother Lord [of whom more anon] info rms us, was held by a few members who were favorable to Darius Wilson—about eight we believe—who were said to represent  Chapters and  ,  members, which was probably a mathematical calcu- lation of what they might expect to get before th e world came to an end. But a remainder of the prospective ten thousand members refused to agree to Darius Wilson’s purchase of the Rite, and elected Judge Parrish as their Gran d Master. Thus there came into existence two spurious branches of the Rite; besides which Calvin C. Burt continued to confer degrees. This led to a judi cial tribunal in which Wilson expelled Burt.... The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts formally endorsed the assertion that Wilson is running the Rite to make money, and expelled him from the Craft. ²⁴ A Grand Mystic Temple had been chartered in Canada by Alexander B. Mott. The Canadian members declared themselves independent, organized a Sover- eign Sanctuary, and chartered a body of the Rite of Misraim in the United States, with W. B. Lord of Utica, New York as Grand Master. Mott claimed that all rights to the Rite of Misraim in the United St ates b elong ed to him by virtue of hi s o ffi ce as Grand Ma ster of the Ri te of Memphis. ²⁵ This led to much con- troversy with bo th Lord and Mott strongly asserting their authority. Wilson went on conferring the degrees of the Rite of Memphis, and, in addi- tion, the three Craf t degrees and, as a consequence, was expelled by the Grand Lodge of New York in  for illegall y conferring these degrees under claimed authority fr om the cl andestine “Grand Lodge of Ohio” which had been organ- ized as a rival to the legitimate Grand Lodge of that state. ²⁶ About  he merged his branch of the Rite of Memphis with that of Isaac H. Parrish and W. B. Lord, under the name of the “Royal Masonic Rite.” This body never assumed any real importance and soon passed into oblivion. Dr. Alexander B. Mott, hea d of the Seymour branch of the Rite, died in  . He was su cc eeded by Harvey G. Goodale. ²⁷ In September,  ,G oodale turned over all the papers and co ntrol of the Rite to Ellis B. Guild, who kept control until just before he died on May  ,  .There are several cl aimants to Guild’s authority, but so far as can be ascertained, this branch of the Rite is now entire- ly dormant, or we might say is “a Shadow body.” It is wor thy of note that practically all those who have been actively engaged in the promotion of the Rite of Memphis have been prominently identi fi ed with other spurio us Masonic Bodies.

Grand Lodges Frown Upon Sp urious Rites and Degrees While th e various State Grand Lodges admit that Chapters of Royal Arch Masons, Councils of Royal & Select Mast ers, Commanderies of Knights Templar, and bodies of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, working under the authority of regular Gr and Bodies, are a part of legitimate Masonry, they have quite gen- erally taken the stand that such organizations as the Rites of Misraim and Mem- phis have no legal status, and a number of them, by constitutional amendment or edic t of the Grand Master, have forbidden members of their Lodges in their jurisdiction to as so ciate themselves in any way with such organizations. In  ,the Gran d Lodge of Massachusetts amended its constitution (sec- tion  ) to read as follows: Any Mason in this jurisdiction who shall confer, communicate, or sell, or assist in conferring, commu nicating or selling, or so licit anyone to receive or apply for, an y so-called Masonic degree or degree limited to Freema- sons, not hereinbefo re recognized or admitted, may be ex pelled from all the rights and privileges of Masonry. The degrees excepted are those conferred in the bodies named in the preceding paragraph. Section  of the Consti tution of the Gran d Lodge of New York says: As the true and le gitimate source of Masonic authorit y and the supreme and sovereign Masonic body in this Grand Jurisdiction, this Grand Lodge recognizes as Masonic only those organizations or bodies which it shall declare so to be or with which it is in Masonic a ffi liation. Any Mason under the jurisdiction of this Grand Lodge who shall hereafter take or receive, confer or be pres ent at, or assist in the conferring of any degree, grade or order, in or under the authorit y of any organization or body claiming to be Masonic, or whic h uses or employs in its ceremonies, either directly or indirectly, or by reference to or otherwise, any part of the esoteric work, signs or symbols of the three degrees of Ancient Craft Masonry, and which is not declared to be recognized as such Masonic organization or body by this Grand Lodge, is guilty of a Masonic o ff ence. The Section following the above lists the same bodies as previously referred to as duly recognized.

Unfounded Cl ai ms of the Rite of Memphis There is ample evidence that the Rite of Memphis laid claim to the  rd Degree of the Ancient A ccepted Scottish Rite, and held that those who had received this degree of the Rite of Memphis should be acknowle dged as legitimate Thirty- Third Degree Masons of the Scottish Rite. At the Annual Meet ing of the Suprem e Council of the Northern Masonic Jur isdict i on for  ,three members of Hope Lodge No.  ,F.& A.M.of New Yo r k C i t y , n a m e l y James M. Rabbs, John J. Gorman, and Willard C. Black, pre- sented a memorial asking that they receive recognition as  rd Degree Masons of the A.A.S.R., they having received the Thirty-Third Degree according to the Rite of Memphis. This memorial was referred to a special committee, which reported that “it is evident that these brethren ha ve been victim s of imposture,” and that “the prayer cannot be granted without an entire departure from the principles an d safeguards of the Rite.... Their on ly remedy is to seek the grade which they suppose themselves to possess, through the proper and legitimate channels.” Their names do not appear in the list of members of the Supreme Council, so the distinction they sought was not conferred upon them. John J. Gorman later became Sovereign Grand Commander of the so-called revived Cernea u Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite. ³⁰ Later Developments in the United States In  we fi nd one Ellis B. Guild posing as So vereign Grand Master of the Rite of Memphis for th e United States of America. Guild died some ten years ago, and at present [  ] there are at least four claimants to the Supreme Authority over the organizati on, some holding that they derive authority from Seymour, through direct descent, others that they derive authority from Burt through Wilson an d Parrish, and still another claiming authority from Italy. In addition, at least one group claims a French origin of recent years—this, of course, could not possibly have any basi s of fact, as seen in the early part of this treatment.  Heredom Albert Pike & Wi lliam L. Cummings"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Betw een  and  ,Jacques Ochs,a Rumanian,claimed authority from the National Grand Lodge of Rumania to establish masonic lodges in the United St ates. His au thority was revoked, and he then appeared as a Represen- tative of the Gr and Orient of Spain for the Rite of “Memphis and Misraim,” and established lodges in New York which he told the initiates were regular mason- ic bodies in which they could get all the degrees at low rates. His operations extended to Philadelphia, Pennsyl vania, and Chicago, Illinois, where he found numero us dupes at so much per capita. He was denounced by regular masonic authorities, an d soon found himself under arrest, after which the bodies he had founded soon ceased to ex ist., This was simply another case of a clever degree- peddler preying upon credulity and ignorance. The Ochs Rite of “Memphis and Misraim” was not the Marconis Rite, but evidently some invention of his own. There was also a short-lived Egyptian Masonic Rite of Memphis for the Cos- mo s in Boston, Massachusetts, about  ,and there are record s of an Ancient and Pr imitive (Spanish) Rite of Memphis and Misraim at New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago about  –  ,which had no conn ection with the Rite established here by Marconis. ³¹ Evidence of continued activi ties of this old Boston rite, or a revival of one of Wilson’s various activi ties, was found in recent ye ars. The prime mover is a ma n who headed a clandestine Massachusetts symbolic lodge, as shown by court records in the archives of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. The testimony in the legal prosecution of the frauds is interesting reading. Matthew McBlain Thompson, of America n Masonic Federation notoriety, also included the Rites of Memphis and Misrain in his list of Orders or degrees, as is shown by his testimony in the trial at Salt Lake City, Utah, in  ,whe n he was convicted of fraudulent use of the mails of the United States, fi ned $  , , and sentenced to serve two years in the Federal Penitentiary. His pretension to Scottish recognition was exposed by testimony showing that the Grand Lodge of Scotland does not reco gniz e these Rites as belonging to Freemasonry. ³² The Rite of Memp his in England On October  ,  ,W.Grey Cl arke, Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of England, issued a circular (see The Freemason ,September  ,  ) directing Masters of Lodges to see that no member of the “Reformed Order of Memphis, or Rite of the Grand Lodg e of Philadelphes” should be admitted to any Lodge, and asking them to remind the members of their lodges that they could hold no communication with irregular lodges without incurring the penalty of expul- sion from the Order, and the liability of being proceeded against under the Act  ,G eorge III, for taking part in the meetings of illegal secret societies. In the same issue of The Freemason ,there appeared a letter from Meyer and Lowenstark, which stated that the Antient and Primitive Rite of Memphis, late- Vo l u m e ,   The Sp urious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ly introduced into England by B. D. Hyam, Past Grand Master of Masons of Cal- ifornia, U.S.A., had no connection with the spurious body named. In The Freemason of October  ,  ,we fi nd this note, “We are requ este d to state that the Rite of Memphis is not and never has been recognized by the Grand Orient of Fr ance and Further, that it is viewed as an imposture by the heads of the Masonic Orde r in America, who have reportedly denounced the reputed ‘Sovereign of Memphis,’ Harr y J. Sey mour an d his colleague, not only as spurious Masons, but of men unworthy of credit in every respect. We are informed that the rite is impious and atheistical in its teachings and that active measures are on foot to expose the iniquity of its proceedings.” Again we fi nd in The Freemason of October  ,  ,page  ,an editorial stating that the Grand Orient of France desired to absorb the Rite of Memphis and so wipe out what it considered an anomaly and a disgrace to the Craft. According to Brother Dudley Wright, all doubt as to the illegality of the Antient and Primitive Rite had been settled on April  and  ,  ,when a con- cordat was arrived at betw een the Ancient and Accepted Rite for England, Wa l e s , a n d the Dominions and Dependencies of the British Crown, the Grand Lodge of Mark Mater Masons of England, Wales, etc., and the Great Priory of the United Religious and Military Orders of the Temple of England and Wales, by which any member of th ese three bodies becoming or continuing a member of the Antient and Pr imitive Rite was ipso facto excluded from any or all of these bodies. ³³ Despite this decree, a charter was granted, in  ,for a Sovereign Grand Body for Gr eat Britain and Ireland, which was formally inaugurated by Harry J. Seymour, Grand Master General of the Un ited States. M ost prominently identi- fi ed with the movement was John Yarker. He had previously been invested with the degrees by Benjamin D. Hyam, under patent from Harry J. Seymour and was installed as Grand Mater General of Great Britain and Ireland. Charters were granted fo r Chapters in London, Manches ter, Havant, and Dublin. Later bodies were warr anted for Burnley and Aberdeenshire. ³⁴ At this t ime the number of de grees of the Rite had been o ffi cially reduced by Seymour to thirty-three (from ninety-six), but according to a letter from John Y arker permission was granted to the various bodies to work such other side- degrees as they migh t desire, if in accord with the old system. ³⁵ John Y arker was the prime moving spirit of the Rite in England. He was a Masonic student of some repute and a writer of no m ean ability. He seemed, however, to ha ve a penchant for er ratic quasi-Masonic organizations, including the Rite of Swedenborg, of which he was Supreme Grand Master for the United Kingdom, the Sat Bhai of Prague, and various other mystic and occult institu- tions. ³⁶ He also signed himsel f“F.S.

The  “revival” in Belgium, whic h recognized the Yarker charters, is obviously irre gular and has no standing. A periodical called The Kneph ,devoted to the interest s of the Rite, was edited fi rst by Kenneth R. H. MacKenzi e and afterward by John Yarker. This was succeeded by another peri- odical entitled The Zuzimuth ,which was very short-lived. Summary The Rites of Misraim and Memphis have been a thorn in the side of legitimate Freemasonr y ever y si nce their inception. For th e most part th ey have been exploited by Masoni c adventurers, many of whom had been expelled from free- masonry, for their own personal pro fi t. Since  it has been un der th e control of the Gran d Orient of France which has never authorized its working beyond the fi rst three degr ees, and in these only to such lodges of the Rite as had previ- ously been established, all of which soon abandoned it. It appears that Marconis acted in bad faith with the Grand Orient, and that, after th e Rite had been taken under its protection, claimed that his renunciation of his authority to the Gr and Orient had been for France only, and proceeded to issue alle ged authority for its promulgation in other countries to Seymour and others. These rites never formed any part of legitimate Freemasonry. Its rituals are a mass of anachronisms, distorted history, inaccurate science, and jumbled phi- losophy. Being issued in printed form, the y are quite common and easy to access. To pay money to anyone for the conferring of these degrees is a case of a “fool and hi s money.” Whatever abstract interest they may have for the student of ritual, they are of no practical utilit y and properly belong in a library of masonic curios.  Heredom Albert Pike & Wi lliam L.

According to what appears to be the most reliable accounts, it was designed by one Samuel Honis, a native of Cairo, Eg ypt, who, with Gabr iel Mathie u Marco- nis de Negre and others, founded the fi rst Lodge, Les Discip les de Me mphis at Montauban, France, in  .The Rite cons isted, when in full bloom, of  degrees if which  were “working ”degrees and  o ffi cial grades. There is also the grade of Grand Hierophant  °who presid es as head of th e Rite in the world. The latter is selected by the pr esiding Grand Master Generals of the Sov- ereign Sanctuaries existing in the various countries where bodies of the Rite function. The last Gran d Hierophant (prior to  ) appears to have been John Y arker of England, who died on March  ,  . On November  ,  ,the Gran d Hierophant, Jacques-Etienne Marconis de Negre,  °, visited the United States and set up a Sovereign Sanctuary with David McLellan,  °Grand Master Ge neral.

In  ,Alexander B.Mott,  ° became head of the Sovereign Sanctuary. He was su cc eeded by Harvey Goodale  °in  and then Elis B.

There were Sov- ereign Sanctuaries of the Rite in France, England, Germany, Canada, New Zealan d and possibly Belgium and Italy, besides in the United States. All these bodies outside of the United States are dormant. The Calvin C. Burt–Isaac H. Parrish and the Darius Wilson groups in the United St ates have long since become dormant. Th e Elis B. Guild group split and there came into existence a group headed by Roland A. Case. This group would have expi red but fo r the authority resting in Henry V. A.
