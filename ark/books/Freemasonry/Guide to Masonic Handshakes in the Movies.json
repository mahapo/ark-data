[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Guide to Masonic \"Handshakes\" in the Movies Over 194 films in chronological order, updated in 2001 by Dean Grace his is a list of films containing one or more of the three most common Masonic handshakes (pressing the thumb of the right hand over the knuckle joints or between the knuckle joints on the other hand) used by certain world political leaders and certain motion picture actors and actresses viewed on various VHS tapes using the slow motion control and freeze-frame control (pause button) on a VCR. This list of films is arranged in ascending chronological order according to the year in which each film was made. Time is measured from the beginning of the Feature Presentation to the first Masonic handshake in the film. Background: The real grip of the Entered Apprentice, first degree of Freemasonry, is given by pressing the thumb of the right hand over the forefinger knuckle joint (where it meets the hand) on the other person's hand. The real Fellow Craft, a.k.a., Fellowship grip of the second degree of Freemasonry, is given by pressing the thumb of the right hand over the knuckle joint (where it meets the hand) of the second finger (middle finger). The \"pass grip\" of the Master Mason, the third degree of Freemasonry, is given by pressing the thumb between the knuckle joints of the second (middle) and third (ring) fingers. The \"pass grip\" of the Master Mason is different from the \"Lion's grip\" of the Master Mason that is used inside the lodge to raise a person to Master Mason status. The Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and the \"pass grip\" of the Master Mason are the most common Masonic handshakes used outside of the Masonic lodge. Because of the quick nature of \"handshaking\" and differences in the sizes of people's hands any handshake where the outstretched thumb (or cocked-thumb) presses the first knuckle, the middle knuckle, or the joint between the middle finger knuckle and third finger knuckle on the other hand is a Masonic handshake recognizable by Freemasons around the world. Freemasons swear an oath to always conceal and never reveal the secrets of Freemasonry. I am not bound by that restriction. List The Birth of a Nation, © 1915 David W. Griffith Corporation.

Memphis in ancient Egypt is thought by many Masonic historians to be where the oldest of the \"ancient mysteries\" were taught which many of the rituals of Freemasonry are modeled after. The secret initiation into the Egyptian \"mysteries\" consisted of some dialog, rituals, contrasts between light (living) and darkness (dying), death, and regeneration. The candidates underwent symbolic trials, failures, and death before being purified and regenerated amid much rejoicing. The lesson was that man by using his own efforts can achieve Divinity.

After the young driver takes off the helmet everyone sees that the driver is Alfalfa's girlfriend \"Darla\" and Spanky faints. The admittance of the \"girls\" into the Rascals' club house at the end of the film demonstrates the politically correct notion of no discrimination on the basis of sex.

Each film was viewed on a regular 13-inch color TV using a 4-head VCR, certainly not high-tech equipment. This list was made as a guide so that those who have not been initiated into the Masonic Order can see the three most commonly used secret Masonic handshakes of Freemasonry using readily available video resources. If I have stimulated a new awareness of a particular historical secretive association of men and women who give secret hand signals between themselves and others then I have succeeded. It is with this hope that I have compiled these pages. Note 2: The Encyclopedia Britannic a defines Freemasonry as \"a term descriptive of the fraternity to which men called Freemasons belong. It is secret in so far as it has rituals and other matters which those admitted take an oath never to divulge.\" From the preceding pages it appears that the phrase \"those admitted\" appears to include women as well as men regarding the secret Masonic hand grips in the first three degrees. The Order of the Eastern Star (OES) is an international organization of women directed entirely by Freemasons. One or more Master Masons must preside at all meetings where degrees are conferred and at least two Master Masons must serve as OES officers. There are five OES degrees, Adah (the daughter), Ruth (the widow), Esther (the wife), Martha (the sister), Electa (the mother), and an honorary degree called the \"Queen of 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"the South.\" These degrees are bestowed upon women who preform the Biblical and Cabalistically inspired OES ceremonies inside Masonic lodges. During these ceremonies women are taught secret oaths, passwords, signs, symbolisms, and a secret handgrip. Quoting from various Masonic sources, \"The basic secrets of Freemasonry we do not seek to learn. We do not wish to make unreasonable demands upon our fathers, brothers, or husbands as Master Masons. Yet when we are told that we are intimately bound to the Masonic fraternity by ties most tender and lasting, we seek some tokens of recognition whereby we may know Masons and be known of them as sharing in the Masonic privileges.\" 1 \"Inviolably in my heart of hearts I will treasure what you have given me this hour, and this tongue shall be torn from its place before the least of your secrets shall be unlawfully made known.\" 2 \"Murder and treason are crimes and so the candidate agrees to conceal crimes of a lesser nature than murder and treason when committed by a brother Master Mason. The Eastern Star Queen of the South agrees that her 'tongue shall be torn from its place,' before the least of any Master Mason's secrets be unlawfully revealed by her, to the proper authorities or to a non-Mason, even though such non-Mason be her own husband . .. Nor dare the 'sister' complain when 'brother' husband goes on the primrose path, for should he be expelled from the lodge, she goes out to, unless she could induce some other brother to become her sponsor. A most ingenious way to make these women keep their mouths shut!\" 3 The Eastern Star uses a secret code to conceal its passwords, rituals, and signs. This code is a compilation of figures and letters in one book which can then be deciphered by using another \"spelling book\" in which every word in the ritual is to be found. Freemasonry believes that this ritual cipher is as secret as any cipher can be which is to be widely used. For example the ritual for Electa, the fifth degree of the Eastern Star is encoded this way: 7T 20s 3o 6E 8i 3m 28b 23c 7t 26a 7u 7t 24b, 7t 51 25a 5o 7t 10o, 7t 15p 3o 7t 13f 11r 7u 7t 18s; 6s, 32t 7t 18e 8u. 7T 3p 8i \"11L 6o 19a. Which deciphered means: The sign of Electa is made by crossing the arms under the bosom, the left arm on the other, the position of the fingers right under the shoulders; slowly, turn the eyes upward. The pass is \"Love one another.\" The ritual for Adah, the first degree is: 7T 20s 3o 1J 2D 8i 3m 28b 3t la 1v... which deciphered means: The sign of Japhthah's Daughter is made by taking a veil. .. and so on. The Ritual of the Order of the Eastern Star states, \"The Ritual and Secret Work are copyrighted. The reproduction of all or any portion of the Ritual and Secret Work in any manner is positively prohibited. Officers and members under the jurisdiction of the General Grand Chapter are forbidden to copy any part of the Ritual or Secret Work for any purpose.

Any member seeing one of these signs given should respond by giving the Pass belonging to the Sign given and then, having withdrawn to a place of sufficient secrecy, should ask,. . .\" 6 (The book does not indicate what to ask). The real origin of the Eastern Star, like Freemasonry, has been purposely shrouded in secrecy. The Eastern Star as a rite seems to go back as early as 1730 however most Masonic sources give the founding of the \"Order\" of the Eastern Star as 1850. After a women is initiated into the Eastern Star she is eligible to join other Masonically-affiliated organizations like the Order of the Amaranth and the Order of the White Shrine of Jerusalem. The Eastern Star is in many ways even more secretive than the Masonic Order because little has been written about its \"secrets.\" It reminds me of a tribe of men protecting their women folk. Then there are the youth groups such as the Rainbow Girls, Job's Daughters, and the DeMolays which are considered to be \"feeder groups.\" The adolescents in these societies are groomed for potential membership in Masonry and the Eastern Star when they reach adulthood. According to a Masonic journal The New Age we are told that about 50% of DeMolays join Masonry when they reach 21 years of age. The August 1991 issue of The Scottish Rite Journal writes, \"DeMolays reach the age of membership at 21. This is not a coincidence; it was intended to provide them with a goal—to be a Mason . . . Masonry is the only organization in the world that has its own ready-made membership resources. We have only to bring these youths into our Lodges, Eastern Star Chapters, or other Masonic organizations.\" 7 Speculation: I believe from all of the preceding evidence and information that the secret handgrip of the International Order of the Eastern Star as mentioned in their Ritual of the Order of the Eastern Star is the Fellow Craft (Fellowship) handgrip of the 2nd degree of Freemasonry (the pressing of the thumb over the knuckle of the other person's middle finger). History: The origins of Freemasonry predate the American Revolutionary War. In the 16 th century, during the Renaissance in western and northern Europe, the British Empire in its quest for world power needed covert intelligence gathering agencies with effective access to the people of Europe. Masonic lodges, which were International Order of the Eastern Star. This book does not disclose nor even mention the Eastern Star ritual ciphers.—ed.) 5 Ibid., p. 80-81. 6 Ibid., p. 82-83. 7 Zeb E. Blanton, Jr., \"Masonic Youth Have We Forgotten,\" The Scottish Rite Journal (August 1991; Vol. 99, No. 8), p. 20. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"primarily Catholic institutions for building cathedrals, schools, and other structures, were widely in use across Europe during the Middle Ages. The British secret intelligence services, working as arms of the British landed nobility, the British intelligentsia, and after 1694 the Bank of England, began to purge Masonry of Catholic, Christian spiritual influences. Covert intelligence gathering was hidden from regular member Masons behind stories of Jewish antiquities, Christian knight-errantries, and the \"occult\" cover of many degrees of mysterious initiations. While today's masonically allied \"Shriners,\" established in the United States in 1872, burlesque the Islamic religion, and the mysteries of Arabia, Egypt, and the Middle East. During the 18 th century, Freemasonry was always \"patriotic\" in Great Britain, but in America and France Masonry was a primary, revolutionary force. Britain's insufficient resistance to the American Revolution allowed \"New Age (Novus Ordo Seclorum)\" deists, freemasons, and freethinkers to install a Masonic republic in North America. For more than three centuries Freemasonry has taught, behind the veils of Masonic Temple pageantries and secret binding oaths, that life is a search for \"Light,\" and that Masonry knows the secret to reach this great \"Light\" of spiritual illumination. Freemasons have historically call themselves \"Sons of Light\" and \"Citizens of the World\" while the profane masses who have not received this secret instruction about \"enlightened self awareness\" are said to be in spiritual darkness. In this 20th century, Masonic teachings have come out of the lodges and have been made increasingly available to the public. Today, the public school systems of America teach the once secret Masonic doctrine of \"total materialism of conscience, education, and state authority\" to children. Freemasonry is an unofficial branch of the governments of Great Britain and the United States, and these governments see to it that Freemasonry is not examined in government subsidized public schools. After men and sometimes women show that they can keep the benign secrets of Masonic ceremonies, handgrips, passwords, and signs they become prime candidates for key positions in government and private industry. Freemasonry concerns itself with Egyptian mysticism, Solomon's Temple, the symbolic working tools of stone masonry, and the occult \"Cabala,\" i.e., medieval literature that interprets the Scriptures to find \"hidden meanings\" about life. Freemasons represent, symbolically , the ruling class of ancient Egypt that designed and built the Great Pyramids for the puppet-king Pharaohs. During the fall of Egyptian civilization this hereditary priesthood fled northeast and continued its rule in the land of Canaan where they designed and built Solomon's Temple. Throughout the Dark and Middle Ages the priesthood survived in the rivaled hierarchies of Roman Catholicism, Talmudic Judaism, esoteric Islam, the Royal Dynasties of England and Europe, and the Houses that control national and international finance. For centuries Freemasonry has been a social club, a school for secrecy, a nursery that teaches nature worship, and a recruiting depot for political networks and intelligence agencies. Also, the Masonic rituals of the Blue Lodge (the initiatory three degrees of Freemasonry), the Scottish Rite (up to the thirty-second degree), and the York Rite (the so-called Christian \"Knights Templars\" degrees) are an indoctrinating force that inculcates, within the Freemason, a sympathy toward Biblical Israel and Zionism. And the masonically associated \"Shriners\" do the same with Islam. Freemasonry functions as a humanitarian cloak behind which the one-world architects of the secular Novus Ordo Seclorum, today's New World Order, can network together to build a \"New Age\" Solomon's Temple for international bankers, transnational corporations, and big business elites. All with the aid of mass media propagandists to amass the riches of the world atop a worldwide pyramid of universal monetized-debt feudalism whose paradigm is ancient Egypt. The real historical root of Freemasonry lies in the occult philosophy behind the Protestant Reformation of the Renaissance. During the Middle Ages an attempt to merge Cabalism with Roman Catholicism under the guise of \"Christian occultism\" by the Knights of the Temple of Solomon, i.e., Knights Templars, was partially stopped by the Christian Church at the Council of Vienne in the 14 th century. Later, there arose during the \"enlightenment\" of the Renaissance an anti-Christ brotherhood of secret society adepts, who had been initiated into paganism and Cabalistic magic. The marriage between pagan sorcery, as represented by Hermetic Egyptian traditions, and the Cabala, as represented by Jewish traditions, was the occult philosophy of the Protestant Reformation. Catholic and non-Catholic secret societies began infiltrating this occult philosophy into Christian elite circles using the 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"\"black magic\" handbook called the Cabala. \"Christian\" Cabalists began popularizing the idea that the Cabala unveiled a \"secret code\" within the Bible revealing \"hidden meanings.\" Cabalists fomented the rise of a Catholic clergy dissatisfied with official Church interpretation of the Bible. The Protestant Reformation in Elizabethan England was a cover for a renaissance of anti-Christian \"New Age\" occultism revolving around the eternal pagan psychodrama of sex, death, and nature worship that finally resulted in Freemasonry—the universal altruistic screen behind which subsequent secret societies have operated clandestinely. The American \"Republic for which it stands, one nation . . .,\" like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the other national republics around the world are but stepping stones for a Masonic \"One World Government\" republic where the earth's populace will be a layered pyramid of economic classes ruled over by an \"illuminated\" class of anti-Christ dynastic elites. Meanwhile, down at the lodge level, Freemasonry is good fun. People meet lots of people they would never otherwise meet, and good conversation is enjoyed over a good meal, whereas the rituals done in the Masonic lodges across America are mostly amateur theatrics. More importantly Freemasonry is a mechanism of social control, a feudal pyramid, where people of influence and wealth can mix with ordinary folks. In this manner \"New Age\" Freemasons can filter their ethical, moral, and political values down through the social structure of society. One of the first things taught in Freemasonry is obeying rank. The ritual tells how the workmen building Solomon's Temple were split into small lodges in a way \"best calculated to ensure promotion to merit, preserve due subordination and prevent confusion in the work.\" Forget merit, Freemasonry is all about due subordination to a Masonic hierarchy of rank and fortune. While Freemasons can make themselves known to each other with secret handshakes and signs, Freemasons can also make themselves known to each other simply by using a form of words that only a Mason could know, because Masons recite them often in their lodge ritual. Further Speculation: As distasteful as this may be to some people, it is possible that today's universal finger sign of contempt, extending the middle finger from the clenched fist, has a Masonic connection. Freemasonry historically comes clothed in layers of sexual symbolism, e.g., the ceremony of quickly raising the initiate to an erect standing position from lying prone on the lodge floor, the compasses as the symbolic dominate male standing over the square as the symbolic submissive female, the phallic vertical columns that guard the entrance to the lodge, the point within a circle representing sexual union, the reproductive symbolism of the Pythagorean theorem (the sexual union of the male and female that produces offspring), obelisks as phallic grave markers and monuments, the Rose Croix degree (the Rose as a symbol of the blooming of the genital organs of women), the sun representing the male and the moon representing the female, Masonic contempt for the uninitiated profane who have not been raised in the lodge. And, as seen in the preceding films, the Fellow Craft and Master Mason's hand grips are fixated with the knuckle of the most phallic finger of the hand, the middle finger. Conclusion: Some scientists believe that the reason modern man \"shakes hands\" is that a very long time ago as primitive men approached each other in the wilderness they presented their open hands as a gesture of friendship to show they held no weapons. Freemasonry as the Big Daddy, great-great. . . Grandfather of today's American, British, and other secret intelligence services, on the other hand, has always used secrecy as a weapon against the uninitiated. The modern technology of \"freezing\" the VHS film frame using the pause button on a VCR can strip away some of the secrecy of Masonic handshakes and the anonymity of those who used them. Whether most of the aforementioned Masonic hand grips were intentional, which I believe they were, or some of them unintentional, or some just plain accidental it looks to me like there has been a lot of Masonic handshaking going on in front of the blinking and twinkling of our eyes.

Also as a side bar, I have witnessed both men and women using master mason \"secret handshakes\" on television game shows. The New World Order, a world federation of nations run by international and national central bankers, big business elites, transnational corporations, and mass media propagandists will use any means necessary, even a police state, to secure the earth for their future scions and protegee. We must resist—it is our God given nature. Dean Grace. April, 2001.
