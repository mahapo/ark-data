Drummond was originally published by the Grand Lodge of Maine in 1877 for the purpose of assisting the lodges in resolving the questions which continually arise, and as a monitor of the various ceremonies. The sixteenth edition has been printed without the \"Digest of Decisions.\" It is important to publish the \"Digest of Decisions in a format which can be readily updated. In past formats, each Grand Master's Decisions have had to remain unprinted until the supply of text books ran out, and a new edition was printed. Not having the Digest of Decisions printed in the Text Book allows the book to remain current.

ITS ORGANIZATIONS. HISTORY The Institution of Masonry, or Freemasonry (for these terms are used indiscriminately), is founded upon the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man: it. therefore, necessarily teaches Morality, Brotherly Love, and Charity: its method of teaching is chiefly by symbols: it has many forms and ceremonies, but these are all intended to teach and impress upon the mind the great principles of the Institution: its votaries are seeking after Truth, symbolized by Light. A Provincial Grand Lodge was formed in Massachusetts under the authority of the Grand Lodge of England, in 1733; and another, under the authority of the Grand Lodge of Scotand, in 1769: during the revolution, these Bodies declared themselves independent of their Mother Grand Lodges, and, in 1792, both united as the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. The first lodge in Maine PORTLAND) was chartered by the English Provincial Grand Lodge; the second (WARREN) by the Scottish Provincial Grand Lodge; and the third (LINCOLN) by the United Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. When Maine became an independent State in 1820, the Lodges, thirtyone in number, formed the Grand Lodge of Maine, in accordance with the wellsettled principle of masonic law, that the lodges in every independent State are of right entitled to form a Grand Lodge for that State. The Grand Lodge of Maine exercises exclusive masonic jurisdiction in this State, and any lodge, organized by any other authority, is illegal and clandestine, with which, or with whose members, no masonic intercourse can be held.

The petition of John Doe for the degrees of masonry, with the usual deposit, was received and referred to the Committee of Inquiry. The committee of Inquiry reported upon the petition of Richard Roe; their report was accepted, the ballot spread, and Richard Roe was elected to receive the degrees within the gift of the lodge. The Committee of Inquiry reported upon the petition of John Roe; their report was accepted, the ballot spread, and he was declared rejected.

CHAPTER III ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES. THE FIRST DEGREE When a candidate, whom a Mason is willing to recommend,desires to apply for initiation, care must be taken that he presents his petition to the lodge nearest his residence. The determination of the place of one's residence is often difficult, especially in Maine, from which so many young men go away into other States to seek employment. the residence, intended by our Constitution, is the home where the party has the right to vote and is bound to pay taxes. This test will generally settle the question, but no rule can be given by which every case can be decided. By a regulation, adopted by most of the Grand Lodges in America, no candidate for the mysteries of Masonry can be initiated without having been proposed at a previous meeting Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (4 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:54 AM]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of the lodge (except by dispensation from the Grand Master) in order that no one may be introduced without due inquiry relative to his character and qualifications.

If practicable, the candidate should examine the Constitution of the Grand Lodge and the bylaws of the lodge before he presents his petition. When the petition is presented, if it appears on its face that the lodge has no jurisdiction of the candidate, it should not be received, but be returned to him; if the lodge appears to have jurisdiction, the petition should be referred to the Committee of Inquiry: after its reference, it cannot be withdrawn by the petitioner until after a favorable ballot. The first duty of the committee is to ascertain beyond question whether the lodge has jurisdiction: if they find that it has not, they should report that fact to the lodge, and if jurisdiction cannot be obtained, the petition must be returned. If the candidate does notreside within thejurisdiction of the lodge, or has not resided there the required time, or is physically disqualified, or has been previously rejected by another lodge, the lodge has no jurisdiction unless it obtains the consent of the other lodge, in those cases in which consent gives jurisdiction. If the committee find that the lodge has jurisdiction, they then inquire and report on the fitness of the candidate to be made a masona duty to be performed with Zealous care and prudence, and \"without fear, favor or affection\": and the character of their report, whether favorable or unfavorable, should never be entered of record.

'Tis like the oil on Aaron's head, Which to his feet distils;Like Hermon's dew, so richly shed On Zion's sacred hills.

On Friendship's altar rising here, Our hands now plighted be, To live in love, with hearts sincere, In peace and unity. THE LAMBSKIN, OR WHITE LEATHER APRON. Is an emblem of innocence, and the badge of a Mason; more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle; more honorable than the Star and Garter, or any other Order that can be conferred upon you at this or any future period, by King, Prince, Potentate, or any other person, except he be a Mason, and which I hope you will wear with pleasure to yourself and honor to the Fraternity. THE TWENTYFOUR INCH GAUGE. Is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. It being divided into twentyfour equal parts, is emblematical of the twentyfour hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby we find eight hours for the service of God and a distressed worthy Brother; eight for our usual vocations; and eight for refreshment and sleep. COMMON GAVEL. The common gavel is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder's use, but we as Free and Accepted Masons are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our minds and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting us as living stones for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. SECOND SECTION. THE BADGE OF A MASON. The lamb has in all ages been deemed an emblem of innocence. He, therefore, who wears the.lambskin as a badge of Masonry, is thereby continually reminded of that purity of life and conduct which is essentially necessary to his gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides.

A LODGE Is a certain number of Masons duly assembled, having the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses, with a charter or warrant empowering them to work. THE FORM OF A LODGE. * * * * * THE SUPPORTS OF A LODGE. Our Institution is said to be supported by three great pillars, called WISDOM, STRENGTH and BEAUTY. It is necessary there should be Wisdom to contrive, Strength to support, and Beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. COVERING OF A LODGE. It is no less than the clouded canopy or starry decked heaven, where all good masons hope at last to arrive, by the aid of that theological ladder which Jacob in his vision saw ascending from earth to heaven called Jacob's Ladder, the three principal rounds of which are called Faith, Hope and Charity. The greatest of these is Charity, because our Faith may be lost in sight, Hope ends in fruition, but Charity extends beyond the grave through the boundless realms of eternity. FURNITURE OF A LODGE. The HOLY BIBLE, the SQUARE and the COMPASSES. The Holy Bible we dedicate to God, the Square to the Master and the Compasses to the Craft. The Bible we dedicate to God because it is the inestimable gift of God to man *** the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the compasses to the Craft, because by its use, we are taught to circumscribe our desires, and keep our passions within due bounds. THE ORNAMENTS OF A LODGE . The Mosaic Pavement, Indented Tessel, and Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon's Temple; the Indented Tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border, or skirting, which surrounded it,with the Blazing Star in the centre. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil; the beautiful border which surrounds it, of those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the centre.

The movable jewels are the SQUARE, LEVEL and PLUMB. The Square teaches morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of life. The immovable jewels are the ROUGH ASHLAR, the PERFECT, ASHLAR and the TRESTLEBOARD. The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry, in its rude and natural state. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, tobe adjustedby the workingtools of the Fellow Craft. The TreslieBoard is for the Master to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive, by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and,by the TresdeBoard, we are also reminded, that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his TrestleBoard, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great books of Nature and Revelation, which are our spiritual, moral and Masonic TrestleBoard. SITUATION. Lodges should be situated due east and west DEDICATION. Lodges in ancient times were dedicated to King Solomon In modern times to St. John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, two eminent Christian patrons of Freemasonry; and since their time there has been represented in every regular and wellfurnished lodge, a certain point within a circle embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. Upon the top of the circle rests the Book of Holy Scriptures. The point represents an individual Brother; the circle, the boundary line of his duty. In going around this circle, we necessarily touch on the two parallel lines, as well as on the Book of Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within their precepts, it is impossible that he should materially err. TENETS. The tenets of your profession as a Mason are Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (10 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"BROTHERLY LOVE. By the exercise of Brotherly Love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one familythe high and low, rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support and protect each other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who profess to be linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, sympathize with their misfortunes, compassionate their miseries, and restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. TRUTH. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us; sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other's welfare and rejoicing in each other's Prosperity. * * * * * CARDINAL VIRTUES. The four Cardinal virtues are Temperence, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice Temperence Is that due restraint upon our affections and passions, which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or the conLracting of any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence in which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would consequendy subject him to the contempt and detestation ofall good Masons.**** FORTITUDE Is that noble and steady purpose of the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril or danger, when prudentially deemed expedient.

This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should be particularly attended to in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token or word, whereby the secrets of Freemasonry may be unlawfully obtained * JUSTICE Is that standard or boundary of right, which enables to render unto every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society; and as justice in a great measure constitutes the really good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every Mason never to deviate from the minutest principle thereof; FREEDOM, FERVENCY AND ZEAL. * * * * * CHARGE AT INITIATION INTO THE FIRST DEGREE. BROTHER:AS you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honorable order; ancient, as having subsisted from time immemorial; and honorable, as tending in every particular, so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better principle, or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down, than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men in all ages have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory from their dignity to level themselves with the fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties, which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, in never Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (12 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"mentioning his name but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his creator; to implore his aid in all your laudable undertakings, and to esteem him as the chief good: to your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you: and to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties will ensure public and private esteem. In the State, you are to be a quiet and peaceful subject, true to your government, and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and conform with Cheerfulness to that government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Let not interest, favor, or prejudice, bias your integrity or influence you to be guilty of a dishonorable action. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations; for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the Institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with wellinformed brethren, who will be always as ready to give, as you will be ready to receive, instruction. Finally: keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the order, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated in to Masonry, be particularly attentive not to recommend him, unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory and reputation of the Institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects. CHAPTER IV. THE SECOND, OR FELLOW CRAFTS' DEGREE . The Master is the judge as to the proper time for the advancement of a candidate: but be should not be advanced until he has made himself sufficiently familiar with the preceding degree to be able to work his way into a lodge open on that degree. If objections are made to his advancement, they must be submitted to the lodge and their sufficiency determined by a twothirds vote.

Thus he showed me: and behold the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. And the Lord said unto me,Amos, what seest thou? And I said, a plumbline. Then said the Lord, I behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people? Israel: I will not again pass by them any more. In some jurisdictions, the following lesson is read: Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge,and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. And now abideth faith, hope and charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity. The following hymn may be used in place of the lesson: MusicShirland. I.

The plumb is an instrument made use of by operative masons, to raise perpendiculars; the square, to square their work; and the level, to lay horizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes: the plumb admonishes us to walk uprighty in our several stations before God and man, squaring our actions by the square of virtue, and remembering that we are travelling upon the level of time, to \"that undiscovered country, from whose bourne no traveler returns.\" CORN, WINE AND OIL. SECOND SECTION Masonry is considered under two denominations: operative and speculative. OPERATIVE MASONRY. By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and from which will result a due proportion and just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings, and convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man, for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes.

By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator. IN SIX DAYS God created the heaven and the earth, and rested upon the seventh day; the seventh therefore our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of the creation and to adore their great Creator. PEACE, UNITY AND PLENTY. * * * * * OF THE GLOBES. The globes are two artificial spherical bodies, on the convex surface of which are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other particulars. The sphere, with the parts of the earth delineated on its surface, is called the terrestrial globe; and that with the constellations, and other heavenly bodies, the celestial globe.

They are the noblest instruments for improving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea of any problern or proposiLion, as well as enabling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and the works, and are induced to encourage the studies of astronomy, geography, navigation, and the arts dependent on them, by which society has been so much benefitted. * * * * * OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE. By order in architecture, is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole. OF ITS ANTIQUITY. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter form the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a covering. The bands, which connected those trees at the top and bottom, are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars, and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. * * * * * Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (17 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" THE TUSCAN Is the most simple and solid of the five orders. it was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its col umn is seven diameters high; and its capital, base, and entablature have but few mouldings. The simplicity of the construcfion of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous. THE DORIC Which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, except mouldings; though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference, in structures where strength and noble simplicity are chiefly required. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present state. In after times, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric; for when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form, the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblence to that pillar in its original state. THE IONIC Bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentals. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar; the invention of which is attributed to the lonians, as the famous temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young women of an elegant shape dressed in her hair; as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust young man. THE CORINTHIAN.

Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentals and modillions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth, by Callimachus, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the following remarkable circumstance: Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady he perceived a basket of toys covered with a tile, placed over an a canthus root, having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up they encompassed the basket, till, arriving at the tile, they meet with an obstruction, and bent downward. Callimachus, struck with the object, set about imitating the figure: the base of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus the tile; and the volutes the bending leaves. THE COMPOSITE Is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian, and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has the quarterround, as the Tuscan and Doric order; is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentals, or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance and beauty are displayed. OF THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE. The ancient and original orders of architecture, revered by Masons, are no more than threeThe Doric, Ionic, and Corinthianwhich were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two: the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally; the Tuscan is Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (19 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in architecture. THE FIVE SENSES. HEARING, SEEING, FEELING, SMELLING AND TASTJNG. The first three, Hearing, Seeing and Feeling, are deemed peculiarly essential to Masons;****~ HEARING Is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions,our purposes and desires; while thus our reason is capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge by the information of others. For these purposes we are endowed with hearing, that, by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete. SEEING Is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structure, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of nature. By this sense we find our way in the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of ii By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more: by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections of our fellowcreatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue lie and dissemble, the countenance would display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (20 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"which administer to this sense are the most astonishing parts of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye, and its appurtenances, evinces the admirable contrivance of nature for performing all its various external and internal motions; while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, clearly demonstrates this organ to be the masterpiece of nature's work. FEELING Is that sense by which we distinguish the different qualities of bodies: such as heat and cold, hardness and softness ,roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion and extension. SMELLING Is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia of vast subtilty, as well in the state of life and growth as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These effluvia, being drawn into the nostrils with the air, are the means by which all bodies are smelled. Hence it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator's having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal, through which the air continually passes in respiration. TASTING Enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that ofsmelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting; and by it we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (21 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Smelling and tasting are inseparably connected; and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society, that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices. On the mind all our knowledge must depend: what, therefore, can be a more proper subject for the investigation of Masons? By anatomical dissection and observation we become acquainted with the body; but it is by the anatomy of the mind alone we discover its power and principles. To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of God's bounty to man, we shall add that memory, imagination, taste, reasoning, moral perception, and all the active powers of the soul, present a vast and boundless field for philosophical disquisition, which far exceeds human inquiry,and are perculiar mysteries, known only to nature and to nature's God, to whom we and all are indebted for creation, preservation, and every blessing we enjoy. * * * * * OF THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES. GRAMMAR Teaches the proper arrangement of words, according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people; and that excellency of pronunciation, which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeably to reason and correct usage. RHETORIC Teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not merely with propriety, but with all the advantages of force and elegance; wisely contriving to captivate the Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (22 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether it be to entreat or exhort, to admonish or applaud. LOGIC Teaches us to guide our reason discretionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted or granted; and in it are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning and disposing; all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in question is finally determined. ARITHMETIC Teaches the powers and properties of numbers, which is variously effected, by letters, tables, figures and instruments. By this art, reasons and demonstrations are given for finding out any certain number, whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. GEOMETRY Treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered, from apoint to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a superficies to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure; or an indivisible part of space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely, length, breadth and thickness. OF THE ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY.

In fine, geometry is the foundation ofarchitecture, and the root of the mathematics. MUSIC Teaches the art of forming concords, so as to compose delightful harmony, by a mathematical and proportional arrangement of acute, grave and mixed sounds. This art, by a series of experiments, is reduced to a demonstrative science, with respect to tones and the intervals of sound. It inquires into the nature of concords and discords, and enables us to find out the proportion between them by numbers. ASTRONOMY Is that divine art, by which we are taught to read the wisdom, strength and beauty of the Almighty Creator, in those sacred pages, the celestial hemisphere. Assisted by astronomy, we can observe the motions, measure the distances, comprehend the magnitudes, and calculate the periods and eclipses of the heavenly bodies. By it we learn the use of the globes, the system of the world, and the preliminary law of nature. While we are employed in the study of this science, we must perceive unparalleled instances of wisdom and goodness, and through the whole creation trace the glorious Author by his works.

When we take a survey of Nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attacks of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man independent; but, as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship.

INSTALLATION OF THE OFFICERS OF A LODGE. No one, elected or appointed to office in a chartered lodge,can enter upon the discharge of his duties until he has been installed. The officers of a lodge under dispensation receive their authority directly from the Grand Master or Grand Lodge, and cannot he installed: and they acquire no rank by such service. The officers of a newly constituted lodge are installed by the Grand Master, or his representative: and he may, in person or by special Deputy, at his pleasure install the officers of any lodge. Subject to this prerogative of the Grand Master, it is the right and duty of every Master to install his successor, or cause him to be installed. But a Warden, acting as Master, cannot, unless he is a Past Master, install his successor, although he may call a Past Master to the chair to perform the ceremony. Any Past Master, and no one but a Past Master (and by that term is meant the Past Master of a lodge), can install a Master. When the Master has been installed, it devolves upon him to install the other officers, but, of course, he may call upon the one who installed him to install all of them. In England, it has been the custom for each subordinate officer to install his successor, but it has not been adopted in this country to any great extent: the retiring officer is sometimes called upon to invest his successor, and even to deliver the charge, but he does this only as the mouthpiece of the Installing Officer. An installed officer holds his office until his successor is installed: and hence, while a reelected officer should be reinstalled, yet, if he is not, he will hold his office by virtue of his former election and installation. Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (36 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"If objections are made by a member of the lodge, to the installation of any officer, the Installing Officer should examine the objections, and, if he deems them insufficient, should proceed with the installation: but if he deems them sufficient, he must suspend the installation of that officer and appoint a time and place for a hearing upon the truth of the allegations upon which the objections are based. If he finds that the allegations are not true, he installs the officer: if he finds that they are true, and that the officer ought not to be installed, he must send to the lodge a certificate to that effect to he entered on its records, and the proper measures should be taken to hold a new election. If the installing officer is the Grand Master, or his Deputy specially authorized to hear and determine objections to an installation, there is no appeal from his decision: but in all other cases, an appeal lies to the Grand Master from the final decision ~fth~ Installing Officer, and, in case an appeal is taken, all further proceedings are suspended until it is determined. But if the decision of the Installing Officer is that the objections are not sufficient, or are not sustained at the hearing, the appeal from his decision must he taken before the insiallation, or it will be too late. While, in some jurisdictions, officers can be installed only in a tyled lodge, in this and most others they may be installed in public. When the installation is public, arrangements should be made for the following programme: Music PRAYER Music. Installation Of The Master. Music.Master's Installation Ode.

The lodge should open at its Hall and march in procession to the place where the ceremonies are to be performed: and, after they are finished, retum to its Hall and close. If thc services are at the Hall, the lodge should be opened and closed in an anteroom, and never in the presence of profanes. A portion of the ceremony of the installation of a Master can be performed only in a Convention of not less than three Past Masters of a lodge. It is known as the Past Master's Degree,\" and is often confounded with a degree of the same name conferred in Royal Arch Chapters; but the Chapter Past Master cannot, in this State, be recognized by a Past Master of a lodge. In different jurisdictions, the usage, as to the time when this ceremony is to be performed, differs: in some, it must be performed as a part of the installation ceremony; in these, when the installation is inalodge, all exceptPast Masters (including Masters in the chair) are reqrnred, at the proper time, to retire, while the Master is invested with this \"degree,\" and then to return to assist in the remaining ceremonies; and when the installation is public, this ceremony is either performed before leaving the lodge room for the public hall, or after returning from the public services: in others, the Installing Officer, at his convenience, generally before, but it may be after, the installation, with the necessary assistance, performs this part of the ceremony. After installation the officer is entitled to serve, unless it appears that he is actually ineligible, all other questions being settled by the installation. When an officer is declared. by competent authority, to be duly installed, his installation is valid, although portions, or even all, of the ceremony have been omitted. When a meeting is held for installation, the lodge must be opened on the third degree. A suitable Brother is appointed as Marshal for the occasion, to present the officers and perform such other duties as the Installing Officer may require of him. After a prayer and (if practicable) appropriate music, the Marshal, by direction of the Installing Officer, collects the Jewels, the Three Great Lights, the Rule, the Line, the Book of Constitutions, the Charter, the Records, the ByLaws, the Gavel, the Truncheons of the Wardens, the Deacons' Rods, the Stewards' Rods, the Marshal's Baton and the Tyler's Sword, and place them upon a table, so arranged that he can promptly hand them to the Installing Officer when required.

When a visit from the Grand Lodge is announced, the Master, having opened the lodge on the third degree, stations the Deacons and Stewards at the sides of the door with their rods crossed, and arranges the Brethren in lines from the door to the Chair, facing inwards. He then sends a Past Master to escort the Grand Lodge, which enters in procession, the Grand Tyler, however, remaining at the door. The Grand Lodge proceeds up to the East, and opens to the right and left, when the Grand Master passes through and ascends the Master's platform, and the other Grand Officers pass to the righL of the Master. The Master receives the Grand Master according to ancient usage, with the private grand honors of Masonry, and resigns to him the chair and the gavel, whereupon each other Grand Officer assumes his appropriate station in place of the corresponding officer of the lodge, and the Brethren are seated.

No brother should be allowed to visit a lodge for the first time without an introduction. If the visitor is a Past Master, he should be invited to a seat Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (54 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"in the East: and if he is an Officer of any Grand Lodge, or a Permanent Member of our own Grand Lodge, or a Past Grand Master, he should be received with the grand honors at the time of his introduction.

He should invariably, as soon as the lodge is opened, give a general invitation to all Past Masters to take seats in the East: and this invitation should be accepted by those present, unless there are special reasons for not doing so. CHAPTER VIII. MASONIC PROCESSIONS The too great frequency of Masonic Processions in public is an evil greatly to be deplored. In this State no lodge can form a public procession, except for funerals and attendance upon Divine Services, without the consent of the Grand Master. Formerly lodges had the right to appear in public on St. John's Days; and if the ancient manner of celebrating those days should ever again prevail undoubtedly lodges would be permitted to do so without being required to obtain special permission. The rule is that Masonic processions are allowable only when some Masonic work is to be done. But in former times Masons frequently appeared in public in their distinctive character to pay respect to the Chief Magistrate, either upon occasions of a public reception of him, or of public mourning for his death. Some have attempted to make a distinction, holding that when the Chief Magistrate is, or has been a Mason such a course is proper, but when not it is improper. But an examination of the Old Charges and Regulations will clearly show that there is no ground for this distinction, and that they teach the propriety of Masons, in their character as such, honoring the Chief Magistrate while living, and mourning for him when dead. The post of honor in Masonic processions is in the rear. Marshals should walk or ride on the left flank of a procession. When a procession faces inwards, the Deacons and Stewards cross their rods, so as to form an arch for the Brethren to pass beneath. All processions return in the same order in which they set out. The Musicians, if Masons, follow the Stewards: otherwise they precede the Tyler.

In WEB's Monitor, published in 1805, and in subsequent editions, places are assigned, in processions of lodges, to Royal Arch Masons and Knights Templar immediately preceding the Masterand it was for some time customary for masons of those degrees to take places in a lodge procession, clothed in their peculiar insignia. This is believed to have been an innovation at that time, as it is not found in any of the earlier Monitors, either of WEBB or other authors. Indeed, in the Pennsylvania Ahiman Rezon of 1783, it is stated by the authority of DERMOTT in 1772, that \"Royal Arch Masons must not, at a procession, nor in any other place except in the Royal Arch Lodge, be distinguished by any garment or badge different from what belongs to them as officers or members of the Grand, or their own private lodge.\" Dalcho, in his Ahiman Rezon of 1807, says: \"In all Masonick Processions, no Freemasons shall wear the insignia of any order above the degree of a Master Mason\": but, in his edition of 1822, he assigns a place in.lodge processions to \"Masons of such of the higher degrees as are recognized by the Grand Lodge, in the form of their respective Orders,\" and changes the sentence above quoted to the following: \"In all Masonic Processions, no Freemason shall wear the insignia of any Order which is not recognized by the Grand Lodge.\" Most of the recent Monitors have followed the precedent of WEBB: Mackey, however, follows DALCHO, and assigns places to \"members of the higher degrees.\" The better practice is to follow DERMOTT's, and DALCHO's original rule, except in cases in which a Mason of a different grade has been invited, in his distinctive or official character, by the Body or Officer having charge, to participate in Lile ceremonies. But bodies of other grades, recognized as Masonic, may properly be assigned positions in Masonic processions. Knights Templar, and similar organizations, appearing as a body, should always act as escort: other bodies are placed immediately in front of the officiating lodge, and the Grand Lodge, if that is in attendance. At the funeral of Past Grand Master ROBERT P. DUNLAP, his Commandery acted as escort, his Chapter marched in the procession immediately in front of his Lodge, and members of the Supreme Council, in which he was an officer, in their distinctive clothing, accompanied the Grand Lodge. The same is true of the funeral of CHARLES W. MOORE, with the addition that a body of the Scottish Rite, of which he was a member, also marched in the procession. At the laying of the cornerstone ofthe Masonic Temple in Boston, the Grand Commandery, followed by its subordinates, acted as escort to the procession; the Grand Chapter, preceded by its subordinates, was posted immediately in front of the Grand Lodge, which was accompanied by a Commandery, as a Guard of Honor, Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (56 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"onehalf marching in front and onehalf in the rear of the Grand Lodge: the same order was observed at the dedication of that Temple.

When the Grand Master, or the Deputy Grand Master acting as Grand Master, is present, the Book of Constitutionsshouldbe borne before him by the Masterofthe oldest lodge (or the Senior Past Master), and it must never be borne in procession except before the Grand Master or Deputy acting as such. On entering public buildings, the Bible, Square and Compasses and the Book of Constitutions should be placed in front of the Grand Master. When the Grand Master, or the Deputy, joins a lodge procession, he should be placed immediately in front of the Master and Wardens, and two Deacons and a Sword Bearer should be appointed to attend him: a Grand Warden should be assigned the sarne position and be attended by two Deacons: but if such Grand Officer has charge of the ceremonies, he should be posted immediately in the rear of the Master. These forms of processions may be used by the Grand, or a subordinate lodge, on all public occasions, for which a form is not specially laid down. It should be remembered, that all Masonic processions are under the strict discipline of the lodge room, and, therefore, no one should enter or leave onc without permission of the Master, conveyed through the Marshal or Junior Deacon.

FUNERAL SERVICE. No one below the degree of Master Mason can be buried with, or participate in Masonic funeral ceremonies. None but Master Masons who are members of a lodge or registered by the Grand Lodge, are entitled to Masonic burial, but a lodge may, if it sees fit, bury with Masonic honors an unaffiliated Mason. It is the duty of the lodge of which a Brother is a member, or of the nearest lodge, to\" perform the usual Masonic burial service over deceased Master Masons, when requested so to do by the deceased or his nearest relatives.\" Masonic clothing can be worn at funerals, only when a lodge is present in its organized capacity. A lodge can unite in the funeral procession of a person not a Mason, only as mourners, and not then without the express consent of the Grand Master, or Grand Lodge. When other organizations unite in the burial of a Mason, the lodge after taking charge of the body will conduct the services as if none but Masons were present. The Masonic service must be the final one, except that a religious service at the grave is permissible. Upon the decease of a Mason, the Master of his lodge should ascertain whether the deceased had requested to be buried with Masonic honors, or if such is the wish of his immediate relatives, taking special care not to urge it upon them. If the deceased is a member of a distant lodge, or, of no lodge, but entitled to Masonic burial, the duty devolves upon the oldest lodge in the place where he died, unless some other arrangement is made by those interested. It is the duty of the Master to see that suitable bearers are provided, but in this, as well as other respects, he should consult with the friends of the deceased. The Marshal should make himself familiar with the route the lodge will take and with the location of the grave and the approach to it, in order that he may avoid confusion and be prompt in the movement of the procession. If the deceased was a Grand or Past Grand Officer, the Grand Master Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (60 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"should be promptly notified, in order that he may convene the Grand Lodge, if he sees fit, and be present himself: in such case, the Grand Master, or, in his absence, his representative, will conduct the burial service. A special communication of the lodge should be opened, after which the brethren proceed to the place where the service is to be held. The brethren should be dressed, with as much uniformity as practicable in dark clothes, with white gloves and aprons, the Officers and Past Masters wearing theirjewels: black crape should be worn on the left arm, above the elbow, and a sprig of evergreen on the left breast; and the insignia of the officers should be trimmed with black crape tied with a white ribbon; and a white lambskin apron should be placed upon the coffin. The masonic procession, upon arriving at a proper distance from the grave, should countermarch, and approach it in two lines in open order, passing from the foot to the head, where the Master takes his position, with the Chaplain on his left. Each line should form somewhat in the shape of a half circle, extending from the Master beyond the foot of the grave far enough to give room for the mourners always, and, if the nature of the ground allows and the attendance is large enough to require it, as far as the services can be heard with convenience. If it is impracticable for the brethren to form in a single line within convenient distance, other lines may be formed in the rear of the first. The mourners take their places inside the circle at the foot of the grave, and the bearers on each side of it: the Deacons cross their rods over the head and the Stewards over the foot, and retain their places throughout the service. If the body is to be placed in a tomb, the coffin should be deposited a little in front of it and remain there until the ceremonies are finished: and the brethren form around the coffin in the same manner as around the grave. The custom of burying a brother with masonic honors is ancient, but it has not been ascertained when it originated: the early Constitutions do not mention it, but in 1742 a caricature of a Masonic funeral procession was published, and in 1754 aregulation was adopted restraining the custom. A Service was first published in 1772 by WILLIAM PRESTON, in his \"Illustrations of Masonry.\" MASONIC FUNERAL SERVICE. Chaplin:I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills; from whence cometh my help?

The Committee offers the following brief and simple ritual as a suggested Memorial Service to be held on the evening before a funeral for a deceased Brother. The directions governing the Officers and Brethren of the Lodge at a Masonic Memorial Service shall be those directions provided in the Maine Masonic Text Book, found in the chapter on \"Funeral Service,\" that would apply to this Memoria] Service. Where the room is limited when this service is conducted we suggest the Master take his position at the head and the Chaplain atthe foot of the casket; the Deacons with crossed rods at the head and the Stewards with crossed rods at the foot, retaining their places throughout the Memorial Service; the assembled Brethren remain in their seats until the conclusion of the service. The Brethren will deposit their Evergreen in the usual manner at the conclusion of the Service. On those occasions when the Lodge is requested to participate in the funeral of a Brother, if the Master so desires, this Memorial Service may be substituted for thc regular Masonic Funeral Service. We submit a brief Committal Service to be used at the grave if desired. The Ritual for Masonic Memorial Service is as follows: MASONIC MEMORIAL SERVICE Master: Friends and Brethren, we who are Masons have assembled on this occasion to express our respect and esteem for our Brother who has passed beyond our mortal sight and to share with those near and dear to him our belief in the immortality of the soul.

It used the tools of the builder's trade as emblems and symbols to teach Masons how to build character and moral stature. It teaches service toGod, to a Brother, to all mankind. It seeks constantly to build the temple of the soul and thus to fit Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (66 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"us for that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

Masons believe sincerely that when life on earth comes to a close, the soul is translated from the imperfections of this mortal sphere to that allperfect glorious and celestial Lodge above, where God, the Grand Architect of the universe, presides. With these truths and convictions our Brother was well acquainted. Though perfection of character is not of this world, yet we are persuaded that our Brother sought to live by these truths and principles of Masonry; that they sustained and supported him; and that by them his life was made richer, fuller and more meaningful. (Here the Master or Secretary of the Lodge should give the Masonic biography of the Brother When and in what Lodge he was made a Master Mason; what offices, if any, he has held; any special committee service he has rendered; such other items of Masonic interest available. This biographical data is especially recommended when this service is used strictly as a Memorial Service.) Master When our Brother labored with us in Masonic attire, he wore a white apron which he was taught is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason. By it he was constantly reminded of that purity of life and that rectitude of conduct so necessary to his gaining admission into that Celestial Lodge above. He will now wear that apron forever as the emblem of the virtues it represents.* The Evergreen is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the soul. By it we are reminded of the immortal soul of man which survives the grave and which will never, never die. In accordance with our custom, I now place this Evergreen over the heart of our Brother.* And now to you who shared with our Brother the intimate ties of family and friendship, we tender our affectionate sympathy. Our hearts respond to your hearts in your grief. We trust that these affirmations of faith, in which our Brother shared, may speak to you and inspire you to live with hope and courage. We ask you always to remember that the God and Father of us all is a Loving God, a Compassionate God whose ears are ever open to the cry of the afflicted. Let us pray.

Lift up Thy countenance upon them and give them Thy peace. Amen. * (The Master concluding his statement explaining the APRON, holding it by the two upper comers with the flap toward himself, will place the Apron over the edge of the casket, allowing the strings to fall within the casket. In depositing the Evergreen, the MASTER brings his right hand to his left breast; then extends it, palm downward, over the casket depositing the Evergreen, then carries it above his head pointing to Heaven, and then drops arm and hand to his side. ) At the conclusion of the service the other Officers and Brethren will approach the casket and deposit their Evergreen in like manner.) COMMITTAL AT GRAVE. (A brief Committal suggested for use only on the day of and following the Public Funeral Service.) Master: God has been our dwelling place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth or ever He had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting He is God. He can make us glad even in the days when we are afflicted, for His word appears to His servants and His glory unto their children.

CHAPTER X. INSTALLATION OF GRAND OFFICERS. A Grand Master may be installed by a Present or Past Grand Master of the same or another jurisdiction: if it is not practicable to have the ceremony performed by one of that rank, the Senior Past Master present may act himself, or call to the chair some Past Grand Officer to act under his direction. In some jurisdictions, at the installation of a Grand Master, a ceremony, corresponding to the \"Past Master's Degree\" and called the \"Past Grand Master's Degree,\" is required. It is, however, a recent invention, and never has been practiced in this or our mother Grand Lodge. When the Grand Master has been installed, he installs the other Grand officers himself, or, if he sees fit, causes them to be installed by another, who acts merely as the mouthpiece of the Grand Master. At the appointed hour, the Installing Officer takes the chair, calls to order, announces the business before the Grand Lodge, and appoints some competent Brother to act as Grand Marshal . If the retiring Grand Master is not officiating, he may be requested (instead of the Grand Marshal) to present his successor. By direction of the Installing Officer, the Grand Marshal collects the jewels and insignia of office, and the Grand Secretary reads a lisging of the officers elected.

By immemorial usage and the irrevocable landmarks of Masonry, you are invested, as Grand Master of Masons, with powers and prerogatives which are well nigh absolute. The interests of the Craft, for weal or woe, are placed in your hands during your term of office. The good resolutions which, I doubt not, you have formed in your own mind, that these powers shall not be abused or perverted by you, I would gladly strengthen by a word of admonition, which it will not become me henceforth to utter. The very consciousness of the possession of a great power will ever make a generous mind cautious and gentle in its exercise. To rule has been the lot of many, and requires neither strength of intellect or soundness ofjudgment; to rule well has been the fortune of but few, and may well be the object of an honorable ambition. It is not by the strong arm or the iron will, that obedience and order, the chief requisites of good government, are secured,but by holding the key to the hearts of men. The office of Grand Master is of great antiquity and respect, and is one of the highest dignities to which we may aspire. Its incumbent, to rule well, should possess and practice several important requisites. As a man, he should be of approved integrity and irreproachable morals; freed from the dominion of hasty temper and illgoverned passions; of good repute in the world; and practicing, as an example to the Craft, the cardinal virtues of Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance and Justice. As a citizen, he should be loyal to his government, obedient toiL, laws, prompt in the duties he owes to society, and a pattern of fidelity in all social and domestic relations. As a Mason, he should cling to the old landmarks, and be sternly opposed to their infringement; be proficient in the laws, language and literature of the Fraternity; be desirous to learn and apt to teach; though not for the time a workman, yet be master of the work and qualified to earn his wages; be prompt to aid and relieve, and slow to demand it; be ever mindful, that though elevated for a time above his fellows, that he is elevated by them, and that he is yet a Craftsman, more sacredly bound by a Craftsman's obligation; and that he should cultivate everywhere, and at all times, the golden tenets of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.

Such are some of the more important qualifications which a Grand Master should possess, and the leading errors which he should avoid. While the tools of Operative Masonryto us the most expressive symbolsthe Book of Constitutions and the Holy Writings are all placed in your charge, I would call your attention specially to the latter.

And allow me to say that the honor, with which you are invested, is not unworthy of a man of the highest position, or most distinguished abilities.

Under our Constitution, you have power to grant dispensations for processions: and it is your duty to attend all communications of the Grand Lodge, and to render such assistance to the Grand Master as may be required of you; or, if the Grand Master is absent, to preside in his stead: in case of his death or removal from the State, you succeed to his powers, duties and responsibilities. Your office, therefore, is one of great dignity and much importance, and carries with it a heavy responsibility. The honor that has been conferred on you and the trust that has been reposed in you, demand a corresponding fidelity to the interests of those whose kindness and confidence you are indebted for your official elevation. Let the Book of Constitutions be your constant study, that you may be the better enabled to preserve inviolate the laws and ancient landmarks of the Order, and to assist the M.W. Grand Master with your counsel; and that you may be prepared to exercise the functions of his office, to which you are liable to be called. SENIOR GRAND WARDEN R.W. Brother:In investing you with the jewel of Senior Grand Warden, I perform a pleasant duty. The position which you occupy in the Grand Lodge and among the Fraternity is one of no little importance. In the Grand Lodge, to control practically, under the direction of the Grand Master, the admission of all visitors, to announce specially those who are of rank or eminence, and to aid in the preservation of order, and at all times to render counsel and advice to the Grand Master, are high andresponsible duties, requiring circumspection,vigilance, and reflection; but when to these is superadded the more onerous labor, in conjunction with the Junior Grand Warden, of diligently preserving the ancient landmarks throughout the jurisdiction, it then becomes a trust of deep moment to the welfare of the Craft Your fitness for the discharge of such a trust undoubtedly led to your selection for the office by your Brethren, Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (74 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"and it will be your duty and pleasure so to act as to justify their confidence.

Accept the jewel of your office, and repair to the South, being ever watchful, whether in labor or at refreshment, that the high twelve of observation do not find you with your work, and that of the Craft you superintend, unperformed. GRAND TREASURER. R.W. Brother:I invest you with this jewel as the badge of the office of Grand Treasurer. It is your duty to have charge of the personal property and funds of the Grand Lodge: to receive all moneys due the Grand Lodge: to pay all bills passed by the Finance Committee, and all sums voted by the Grand Lodge or the Trustees of the Charity Fund: to render annually Lo the Finance Committee, your accounts, with the vouchers: to lay before the Grand Lodge, on the first day of each annual communication, a detailed statement of the receipts and expenditures of the preceding year: and finally, to obey all orders of the Grand Lodge and of the Trustees in relation to their respective funds and properties. The keys forming the jewel of your office have a twofold significance: they are instruments to bind as well as to loose; to make fast as well as to open. They will never, l am confident, be used by you in any other manner than the constitutions, laws, rules, and regulations of the Grand Lodge shall direct. RECORDING GRAND SECRETARY. R.W. Brother:Usage, as well as positive enactments from time to time, have rendered the duties of the office of Grand Secretary more onerous and varied than that of any other officer. Brought by his official position more immediately into communication with the whole body of the Fraternity, it is requisite that he should possess ability, skill, and Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (75 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"industry, to meet the various demands upon him. Placed in a position where he holds almost constant correspondence with our Masonic Brethren of every state and country, upon him devolves, in a large degree, the good name and credit of the Masonic family of this State.

Vigilance and fidelity must also be necessary qualities. Our constitutions, my Brother, point out to you fully the duties of your office, and l will not recapitulate them. Your capability for their prompt and faithful execution has induced your Brethren to confide this trust to you, and I feel assured that it is well placed. In investing you with your official jewel, the pens, l am persuaded that they will make an enduring record, not only to your praise, but to the welfare of a Craft so largely dependent upon your experience and integrity. The Grand Marshal will now present the appointed officers, who take the official obligation in the same manner as the others. CORRESPONDING GRAND SECRETARY. R.W.

Grand Master, of answering all foreign communications made to the Grand Lodge, and, when desired by him, to read all communications to it.
