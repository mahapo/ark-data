Due to the extreme suppression of my sexuality I had experienced at their hands which I had never in my life dealt with being openly gay, I felt the best therapy for me in lieu of their abuses would be to spend some time around “my own kind” by going to some nightclubs and dancing, something I had not done in so very long while under their tutelage.

He reached down and grabbed the shifter and put the car back in drive, grabbed my right leg, and slammed my foot on the accelerator and we lurched forward back onto I-30.

Much like how their Reunions dwarf Blue Lodge Degrees, Scottish Rite Stated Meetings dwarf Blue Lodge Stated Meetings because again they have the money, luxury and manpower to pull off impressive theatrics and formal dinners which would captivate anybody frankly. I settled into a basic routine of attending Stated Meetings and for the time being felt just sort of content in my Masonic work. My everyday life was certainly much more exciting than any of this.
