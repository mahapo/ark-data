C EREMONIES OF O PENING A L ODGE OF E NTERED A PPRENTICE M ASONS . One rap calls the Lodge to order; one calls up the Junior and Senior Deacons; two raps call up the subordinate officers; and three, all the members of the Lodge. The Master having called the Lodge to order, and the officers all seated, the Master says to the Junior Warden, \"Brother Junior , are they all Entered Apprenti ce Masons in the South?\" He answers, \"They are, Worshipful.\" Master to th e Senior Warden, \"Brother Senior, are they all Entered Apprentice Masons in the West?\" He answ ers, \"They are, Worshipful.\" The Master then says, \"They are in the East;\" at the same time he gives a rap with the co mmon gavel, or mallet, which calls up both Deacons. Mast er to Junior Deacon, \"Attend to that part of your duty, and inform the Tyler that we are about to open a L odge of Entered Apprentice Masons; and direct him to tyle accordingly.\" The Tyler then steps to the door and gives three raps, which are answered by three from without; the Junior Deacon then gives one, which is also answered by the Tyler with one; the door is then partly opened, and the J unior Deacon delivers his message and resumes his situation, and says, \"The door is tyled, Worshipful\" (at the same time giving the due-guard, which is never omitted when the Master is addressed). The Master to the Junior Deacon, \"By whom?\" He answers, \"By a Master Mason with out the door, armed with the proper implements of his office.\" Master to the Junior Deacon, \"His duty there?\" He answers, \"To keep off all cowans and eave- droppers, see that none pass or re pass without permission from th e Master.\" [Some say without permission from the chair.] Master to Junior Deac on, \"Brother Junior, your place in the Lodge?\" He answers, \"At the right hand of th e Senior Warden in the West.\" Master to Junior Deacon, \"Your business there, Brother Junior?\" He answers, \"To wait on the Worshi pful Master and Wardens, act as their proxy in the ac tive duties of the Lodge, a nd take charge of the door .\" Master to Junior Deacon, \"The Senior Deacon's place in the Lodge?\" He answers, \"At the right hand of the Worshipful Master in the East.\" [The Master, while asking the la st question, gives two raps, which call up all the subordinate officers.] Master to Se nior Deacon, \"Your duty there, Brother Senior?\" He answers, \"To wait on the Wors hipful Master and Wardens, act as their proxy in the active duties of the Lodge, attend to the prep aration and introduction of candida tes—and welcome and clothe all visiting brethren.\" [i.e., furnish them with an apron.] Master to Senior Deacon, \"The Secretary's place in the Lodge, Brother Senior?\" He answers, \"A t the left hand of the Worshipful Master in the East.\" Master to th e Secretary, \"Your duty [Pg 4] there, Brother Secretary?\" He answers, \"The better to observe the Worshipful Master's will and pleasu re, record the proceedings of the Lodge; transmit a copy of the same to the Grand Lodge, if require d; receive all moneys and money-bills from the hands of the brethren, pay them over to the Tr easurer, and take his receipt for the same.\" The Master to the Secretary, \"The Treasurer's place in the Lodge?\" He answers, \"At the right hand of the Worshipful Master.\" Master to the Treasur er, \"Your duty there, Brother Treasurer?\" He answers, \"Duly to observe the Worshipful Master's will and pleasure; receive all moneys and money-bills from the hands of the Secretary; keep a just and true account of the same; pay them out by order of the Worshipful Master and consent of the brethren.\" The Master to the Treasurer, \"The Junior Warden's place in the Lodge, Brother Treasu rer?\" He answers, \"In the South, Worshipful.\" Master to Junior Warden, \"Your business there, Br other Junior?\" He answer s, \"As the sun in the South at high meridian, is the beau ty and glory of the day, so stands the Junior Ward en in the South the better to observe the time; call the crafts from labor to refres hment; superintend them during the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"hours thereof; see that none convert the hours of re freshment into that of intemperance or excess; and call them on again in due season, that the Worshipful Master ma y have honor, and they pleasure and profit thereby.\" Master to the Junior Warden, \"The Senior Warden's place in the Lodge?\" He answers, \"In the West, Worshipful.\" Master to the Senior Wa rden, \"Your duty there, Brother Senior?\" He answers, \"As the sun sets in the West, to close the day, so stands the Senior Warden in the West, to assist the Worshipful Mast er in opening his Lodge; ta ke care of the jewels and implements; see that none be lo st; pay the craft their wages, if any be due; and see that none go away dissatisfied.\" Master to the Senior Warden, \"The Master 's place in the Lodge?\" He answers, \"In the East, Worshipful.\" Master to the Senior Warden, \"His duty there?\" He answers, \"As the sun rises in the East to open and adorn the day, so pres ides the Worshipful Master in the East to open and adorn his Lodge; set his crafts to work with good and wholesome laws, or cause the same to be done.\" The Master now gives three raps, when all the brethren rise, and the Master, taking off his hat, proceeds as follows: \"In like manner so do I, strictly forbidding all pr ofane language, private committees, or any other disorderly conduct where by the peace and harmony of this Lodge may be interrupted while engaged in its lawful pursuits, under no less penalty than the by-laws, or such penalty as a majority of the brethren present may see fit to inflict. Brethren, attend to giving the signs.\" [Here Lodges differ very much. In some they declare the Lodge open, as follows, before they give the sign.] The Master (all the brethren imitating him) extends his left arm from his body, so as to form an angle of about forty-five de grees, and holds his right hand traversely across his left, the palms thereof one inch apart. This is cal led the first sign of a Mas on—is the sign of distress in this degree, and alludes to the position a candi date's hands are placed in when he takes the obligation of an Entered Apprentic e Mason. The Master then draws his right hand across his throat, the hand open, with the thumb [Pg 5] next to the throat, and drops it down by his side. This is called the due-guard of an Entered Apprentice Mason (many call it the sign), and alludes to the penalty of an obligation. The Master then declares th e Lodge opened in the following manner:—\"I now declare the Lodge of Entered A pprentice Masons duly opened for th e dispatch of business.\" The Senior Warden declares it to the Junior Warden, and he to the brethren. \"Come, brethren, let us pray.\" P RAYER . —Most holy and glorious God! the great Arch itect of the Universe: the giver of all good gifts and graces. Thou hast promised that \"Where two or three are gathered together in Thy name, Thou wilt be in the midst of them, and bless them.\" In Thy name we assemble, most humbly beseeching Thee to bless us in all our undertaki ngs, that we may know and serve Thee aright, and that all our actions may tend to Thy glory, and our advancement in knowle dge and virtue. And we beseech Thee, O Lord God, to bless our present assembling; and to illumine our minds through the influence of the Son of Righteousness, that we may walk in the Light of Thy countenance; and when the trials of our probationary state are over, be admitted into the temple not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Amen. So mote it be. A NOTHER P RAYER . —Behold how good and how pleasant it is fo r brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down to the skir ts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountain of Zion, for there the Lord commanded the blessing, evermore. Amen. So mote it be. [This prayer is likewise used on cl osing the Lodge.] The Lodge being now open and ready to proceed to business, the Master di rects the Secretary to read the minutes of the last meeting, which natura lly brings to view the bus iness of the present. If there are any candidates to be brought forw ard, that is the first business attended to. [1] "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" C EREMONIES OF THE A DMISSION AND I NITIATION OF A C ANDIDATE IN THE F IRST D EGREE OF F REEMASONRY . At the first regular communication after the candidate has petitioned for admission, if no objection has been urged against him, the Lodge pr oceeds to a ballot. One black ball will reject a candidate. The boxes [Pg 6] may be passed three times. The Deac ons are the proper persons to pass them; one of the boxes has black and white beans or balls in it, the other empty; the one with the balls in it goes before and furnishes each memb er with a black and white ball; the empty box follows and receives them. There ar e two holes in the top of this box, with a small tube in each, one of which is black, and the other white, with a pa rtition in the box. The memb ers put both their balls into this box as their feelings dictate; when the balls are received, the box is presented to the Master, Senior, and Junior Wardens, who pronounce clear or not clear, as the case may be. The ballot proving clear, the candidate (if present) is conducted into a small preparation room adjoining the Lodge; he is asked the following questions, a nd gives the following answ ers. Senior Deacon to candidate, \"Do you sincerely declare, upon your honor before these gentlemen, that, unbiassed by friends, uninfluenced by unworthy motives, you freely and voluntarily offe r yourself a candidate for the mysteries of Masonry?\" Candidate answer s, \"I do.\" Senior Deacon to candidate, \"Do you sincerely declare, upon your honor before these gentlemen, that you are prompt to solicit the privileges of Masonry, by a favorable opinion con ceived of the institution, a desire of knowledge, and a sincere wish of being serv iceable to your fellow-creatures?\" Candidate answers, \"I do.\" Senior Deacon to candidate, \"Do you sincerely d eclare, upon your honor before these gentlemen, that you will cheerfully conform to all the ancient established usages and customs of the fraternity?\" Candidate answers, \"I do.\" After the above questions are proposed and answered, and the result reported to the Master, he says, \"Breth ren, at the request of Mr. A. B., he has been proposed and accepted in the regular form. I therefore recommend him as a proper candidate for the Mysteries of Masonry, and worthy to partake of the privileges of the frater nity; and in consequence of a declaration of his intentions, voluntarily made, I believe he will cheerfully conform to the rules of the Order.\" The candidate, during the time, is di vested of all his appare l (shirt excepted), and furnished with a pair of drawers, kept in the Lodge for the use of candidates; he is then blindfolded, his left foot bare, his right in a slipper, his le ft breast and arm naked, and a rope, called a cable-tow, 'round his neck and left arm (the rope is not put 'round the arm in all Lodges) in which posture the candidate is conducted to the door, where he is cause d to give, or the conductor gives, three distinct knocks, which are answered by three from within; the conductor gives one more, which is also answered by one from within. The door is then partly opened, and the Junior Deacon generally asks, \"Who comes there? Who comes th ere? Who comes there?\" The conductor alias the Senior Deacon, answers, \"A poor, blind candidate, who has long been desirous of having and receiving a part of the rights and benefits of this worshipf ul Lodge, dedicated (some say erected) to God, and held forth to the holy order of St. John, as all tr ue fellows and brothers have done, who have gone this way before him.\" The Junior Deacon then asks, \"Is it of his own free will and accord he makes this request? Is he duly and truly prepared? Worthy and well qualified? And properly avouched for?\" [Pg 7] All of which being answered in the affirma tive, the Junior Deacon says to the Senior Deacon, \"By what further right does he expect to obtain this benefit?\" The Senior Deacon replies, \"By being a man, free born, of lawful age, a nd under the tongue of good report.\" The Junior Deacon then says, \"Since this is the case you will wait till the Worshipful Master in the East is made acquainted with his request, and his answer returned.\" The Junior Deacon repairs to the Master, when the same questions are asked, and an swers returned as at the door; after which the Master says, \"Since he comes endowed with all th ese necessary qualificatio ns, let him enter this worshipful Lodge in the name of the Lord, and take heed on what he enters.\" The candidate then"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"enters, the Junior Deacon at the same time pre ssing his naked left breast with the point of the compass, and asks the candidate, \"Did you feel anything?\" A NS . —\"I did.\" Junior Deacon to the candidate, \"What was it?\" A NS . —\"A torture.\" The Junior Deacon then says, \"As this is a torture to your flesh, so may it ever be to your mind and cons cience, if ever you shoul d attempt to reveal the secrets of Masonry unlawfully.\" The candidate is th en conducted to the centre of the Lodge, where he and the Senior Deacon kneel, and the Deacon says the following prayer: \"Vouchsafe Thine aid, Almighty Father of the Universe, to this, our present convention; and grant that this candidate for Mas onry may dedicate and devote his life to Thy service, and become a true and faithful brother among us ! Endue him with a competency of Thy divine wisdom, that by the secrets of our art, he may be the better enable d to display the beauties of holiness, to the honor of Thy holy name. So mote it be. Amen!\" The Master then asks the candidate, \"In whom do you put your trust?\" Th e candidate answers, \"In God.\" The Master then takes him by the righ t hand, and says, \"Since in God you put your trust, arise, follow your leader, and fear no danger.\" The Senior Deacon th en conducts the candidate three times regularly around the Lodge and halts at the Junior Warden in the South, where the same questions are asked, and answers returned as at the door. As the candidate and the conductor are going ar ound the room, the Master reads the following passage of Scripture, and takes the same time to read it that they do to go around the Lodge three times. \"Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his garment; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion, for there the Lord comma nded the blessing, even life forevermore.\" The candidate is then conducted to the Senior Wa rden in the West, where the same Questions are asked, and answers returned as before; from thence he is conducted to the Worshipful Master in the East, where the same questions are asked, and answ ers returned as before. The Master likewise demands of him from whence he came, and whither he is traveling. The ca ndidate answers, \"From the West, and traveling to the East.\" Master inquires, \"Why do you leave the West and travel [Pg 8] to the East?\" He answers, \"In search of light.\" Mast er then says \"Since the candidate is traveling in search of light, you will please conduct him back to the West from whence he came, and put him in the care of the Senior Warden, who will teach him how to approach the East , the place of light, by advancing upon one upright regular step, to the first step, his feet forming the right angle of an oblong square, his body erect at the altar before th e Master, and place him in a proper position to take upon himself the solemn oath or obligation of an Entered Apprentice Mason.\" The Senior Warden receives the candidate, and in structs him as directed. He first steps off with his left foot and brings up the heel of the right into the hollow thereo f; the heel of the right foot against the ankle of the left, will, of course, form the right angle of an oblong square; the candi date then kneels on his left knee, and places his ri ght foot so as to form a square with the left, he turns his foot around until the ankle bone is as much in front of him as the to es on the left; the candidate's left hand is then put under the Holy Bible, square and compass, and the right hand on them. Th is is the position in which a candidate is placed when he takes upon him the oath or obligation of an Entered Apprentice Mason. As soon as the candidate is pl aced in this position, the Worshipful Master approaches him, and says, \"Mr. A. B., you are now placed in a proper position to take upon you the solemn oath or obligation of an Entered Apprentice Mason, [2] which I assure you is neither to affect your religion nor politics. If you are willing to take it, repeat your name, and say after me: \"I, A. B., of my own free will and accord, in presence of Almighty God, and this worshipful Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, dedicated to G od, and held forth to the holy order of St. John, do hereby and hereon most solemnly and sincerely pr omise and swear, that I will always hail, ever"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"conceal, and never reveal any part or parts, art or arts, point or points of the secrets, arts and mysteries of ancient Free Masonry, which I have r eceived, am about to recei ve, or may hereafter be instructed in, to any person or persons in the kn own world, except it be a true and lawful brother Mason, or within the body of a just and lawfully constituted Lodge of such, and not unto him, nor unto them whom I shall hear so to be, but unto th em only after strict trial and due examination or lawful information. Furthermore, do I promise and swear that I will not write , print, stamp, stain, hew, cut, carve, indent, paint, or engrave it on anything moveable or imm oveable, under the whole canopy of heaven, whereby, or whereon the least lett er, figure, character, mark, stain, shadow, or resemblance of the same may become legible or in telligible to myself or any other person in the known world, whereby the secrets of Masonr y may be unlawfully obtained through my unworthiness.

Have you not confidence in every virtue? May these thoughts ev er inspire you with the most noble sentiments; may you ever feel that elevation of soul that shall scorn a dishonest act. Brother, what do you most desire?\" The candidate answers, \"Light.\" Master to brethren, \"B rethren, stretch forth your hands and assist in bringing this ne w-made brother from darkness to light.\" The members having formed a circle round the candidate, the Master says, \"And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.\" At the same time, all the brethren clap thei r hands and stamp on the floor with their right feet as heavy as possible, the bandage dropping from the candidate's eyes at the same instant, which, after having been so long blind, and full of fearful apprehensions all the time , this great and sudden transition from perfect darkness to a light bright er (if possible) than the meridian sun in a midsummer day, sometimes produces an alarming effect. After the candidate is br ought to light, the Master addresses him as follows: \"Brother, on being brought to light, you first discover three great lights in Masonry by the assi stance of three lesser; they are thus explained: The thr ee great lights in Masonry are the Ho ly Bible, Square and Compass. The Holy Bible is given to us as a rule and guide for our faith a nd practice; the Square, to square our actions, and the Compass to keep us in due bounds with all mankind, but more especially with the brethren. Three lesser lights are three burning tapers, or candles placed on candlesticks (some say, or candles on pedestals), they represent the Sun, Moon, and Master of the Lodge, and are thus explained: As the sun rules th e day, and the moon governs the ni ght, so ought the Worshipful Master, with equal regularity, to rule and govern his Lodge, or cause the same to be done; you next discover me, as Master of this Lodge, approa ching you from the East upon the first step of Masonry, under the sign and due-g uard of an Entered Apprentice Mason, as already revealed to you. This is the manner of giving them; imitate me, as near as you can, keeping your position. First, step off with your left foot, and bring the heel of th e right into the hollow th ereof, so as to form a square.\" [This is the first step in Masonry.] Th e following is the sign of an Entered Apprentice Mason, and is the sign of distress in this degree; you are not to give it unless in distre ss. [It is given by holding your two hands traversely across each othe r, the right hand upwards, and one inch from the left.] The following is the due-guard of an Entered Apprentice Ma son. [This is given by drawing your right hand across your throat, the thumb next to your throat, your arm as [Pg 10] high as the elbow, in a horizontal posi tion.] \"Brother, I now present you my right hand, in token of brotherly love and esteem, and w ith it the grip and name of th e grip of an Entered Apprentice Mason.\" The right hands are joined together, as in shaking hands, and each sticks his thumb nail"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"into the third joint or upper end of the forefinger; the name of the grip is B OAZ , and is to be given in the following manner and no other: The Master gi ves the grip and word, and divides it for the instruction of the candidate; the questions are as follows: The Ma ster and candida te holding each other by the grip as before described, the Master says, \"What is this?\" Candidate—\"A grip.\" Master \"A grip of what?\" Candidate— \"The grip of an Entered Appr entice Mason.\" Master—\"Has it a name?\" Candidate—\"It has.\" Master—\"Will you give it to me?\" Candidate—\" I did not so receive it, neither can I so impart it.\" Master—\"What wi ll you do with it?\" Candidate—\"Letter it, or halve it.\" Master—\"Halve it and begi n.\" Candidate—\"You begin.\" Ma ster—\"Begin you.\" Candidate— \"BO.\" Master—\"AZ.\" Candidate—\"BOAZ .\" Master says, \"Right, Brother B OAZ , I greet you. It is the name of the left hand pillar of the porch of King Solomon's Temple—a rise, Brother Boaz, and salute the Junior and Senior Wardens as such, and convince them that you have been regularly initiated as an Entered Apprentice Mason, and ha ve got the sign, grip, and word.\" The Master returns to his seat, while the Wardens are examin ing the candidate, and gets a lamb-skin or white apron, presents it to the candida te and observes, \"Brother, I now present you with a lamb-skin, or white apron; it is an emblem of innocence, and the badge of a Mason; it has been worn by kings, princes, and potentates of the earth, who have never been ashamed to wear it; it is more honorable than the diamonds of kings, or pearls of princesses, when worthily worn; it is more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle; more honorable than the Star and Garter, or any other order that can be conferred upon you at this or any other time, except it be in the body of a just and fully constituted Lodge; you will carry it to the Senior Warden in the West, who will teach you how to wear it as an Entered Apprenti ce Mason.\" The Senior Warden ti es the apron on, and turns up the flap, instead of letting it fall dow n in front of the apron. This is the way Entered Apprentice Masons wear, or ought to wear, their apr ons until they are adva nced. The candidate is now conducted to the Master in the East, who says, \"Brother, as you are dressed, it is necessary you should have tools to work with; I will now present you with the worki ng tools of an Entered Apprentice Mason, which are the twenty-four-inch gauge and common gavel; th ey are thus explained: The twenty-four-inch gauge is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to measure and lay out their work, but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. The twenty-four inches on the gauge are emblematical of the twenty-four hours in the day, which we are taught to divi de into three equal parts, whereby we find eight hours for the service of God and a worthy distressed brother; eight hours for our usual vocations; a nd eight for refreshment and sleep; the common gavel is an in strument made use of by operative Masons to break off the [Pg 11] corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder's use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, use it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds as living and lively stones for that spiritual bu ilding, that house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. I also present you with a new name; it is CAUTION ; it teaches you, as you are barely instructed in the rudiments of Masonry, that you sh ould be cautious over all your wo rds and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry. I shall next present you with three precious jewels, which are a LISTENING EAR , a SILENT TONGUE , and a FAITHFUL HEART . A listening ear teaches you to listen to the instructions of the Worshi pful Master, but more especially that you should listen to the cries of a worthy distressed brother. A si lent tongue teaches you to be sile nt while in the Lodge, that the peace and harmony thereof may not be disturbed, but more especially that you should be silent before the enemies of Masonry, that the cr aft may not be brought into disrepute by your imprudence. A faithful heart teaches you to be faithfu l to the instructions of the Worshipful Master at all times, but more especially that you should be faithful, and keep and conceal the secrets of Masonry, and those of a brother wh en given to you in charge as su ch, that they may remain as secure and inviolable in your br east as his own, before communi cated to you. I further present you with check-words two; their names are TRUTH and UNION , and are thus explained: Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of ever y virtue; to be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Masonry; on this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct; hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other's welfare, and rejoicing in each other's pros perity. Union is that kind of friendship which ought to appear conspicuous in every Mason's conduct. It is so clos ely allied to the divine attribute, truth, that he who enjoys the one is seldom destitute of the ot her. Should interest, honor, prejudice, or human depravity ever induce you to violat e any part of the sacred trust we now repose in you, let these two important words, at the earliest insinuation, teac h you to put on the check-line of truth, which will infallibly direct you to pursue that straight and na rrow path which ends in the full enjoyment of the Grand Lodge above, where we shall all meet as Masons and members of the same family, in peace, harmony, and love; where all discord on account of politics, religion, or private opinion, shall be unknown, and banished from within our walls. \"Brother, it has been a custom from time im memorial to demand, or ask from a newly-made brother, something of a metallic kind, not so much on account of its intrinsic value, but that it may be deposited in the archives of the Lodge, as a memorial that you was herein made a Mason; a small trifle will be sufficient—anything of a meta llic kind will do; if y ou have no money, anything of a metallic nature will be sufficient; even a bu tton will do.\" [The candida te says he has nothing about him; it is known he has nothi ng.] \"Search yourse lf,\" the Master [Pg 12] replies. He is assisted in searching—nothing is found. \"Perhaps you can borrow a trifle,\" says the Master. [He tries to borrow, none will lend him; he pr oposes to go into the other room where his cl othes are; he is not permitted: if a stranger, he is very much embarrassed.] Master to candidate, \"Brother, let this ever be a striking lesson to you, and teach you, if you should ever see a friend, but more especially a brother, in a like penniless situatio n, to contribute as liberally to his relief as his situation may require, and your abilities will adm it, without material injury to yourself or family.\" Master to Senior Deacon, \"You will conduct the candidate b ack from whence he came, and invest him of what he has been divested, and let him return for further instruction. A zealous attachment to these principles will insure a public and private esteem . In the State, you are to be a quiet and peaceable subject, true to your government, and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty, but faithfully submit to legal authority, and conf orm with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Although your frequent app earance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should in terfere with your nece ssary vocations; for these are on no account to be neglected: neither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-in formed brethren, who w ill be always as ready to give, as you will be to receive information. Fina lly, keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the Order, as these are to distinguish you fro m the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly attentive not to commend him, unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that th e honor, glory, and reputation of the institution may be firmly established, and the world at large conv inced of its good effects.\" Here the initiation ends, and the candidate is congratu lated by his Masonic friends. After this, the business of the meeting proceeds according to the by-laws or regulations of the Lodge. Before adjourning, it is a very common pr actice to close a Lodge of Entered Apprentices, and open a Lodge of Fellow Crafts , and close that, and open a Ma ster Mason's Lodge, all in the same evening.

A brother having made a motion that the Lodge be closed, it being s econded and carried, the Master says to the Junior Deac on, \"Brother Junior [giving one ra p, which calls up both Deacons], the first as well as the last care of a Mason?\" Th e Junior Deacon answers, \"To see the Lodge tyled, Worshipful.\" Master to the Juni or Deacon, \"Attend to that part of your duty, and in form the Tyler that we are about to close this Lodge of Ente red Apprentice Masons, and direct him to tyle accordingly.\" The Junior Deacon steps to the door and gives three [Pg 13] raps, which are answered by the Tyler with three more; the Junior Deacon then gives one, which is also answered by the Tyler by one. The Junior Deacon then opens the door, delivers his message, and resumes his place in the Lodge, and says, \"The door is tyled, Wors hipful.\" Master to Junior Deacon, \"By whom?\" A NS . \"By a Master Mason without the door, armed with the proper implements of his office.\" Master to Junior Deaco n, \"His business there?\" A NS . \"To keep off all cowans and eavesdroppers, and see that none pass or repass without permissi on from the chair.\" Master to Junior Deacon, \"Your duty there?\" A NS . \"To wait on the Worshipful Master a nd Wardens, act as their proxy in the active duties of the Lodge, and take care of the door.\" Master to Junior Deacon, \"The Senior Deacon's place in the Lodge?\" A NS . \"At the right hand of the Wors hipful Master in the East.\" Master to Senior Deacon, \"Your duty there, Brother Senior?\" A NS . \"To wait on the Worshipful Master and Wardens, act as their proxy in the ac tive duties of the Lodge, at tend to the preparation and introduction of candidates; receive and clothe all visiting brethren.\" Master to the Senior Deacon, \"The Secretary's place in the Lodge?\" A NS . \"At your left hand, Wo rshipful.\" Master to Secretary, \"Your duty there, Brot her Secretary?\" The Secretary re plies, \"Duly to observe the Master's will and pleasure; record the proceedings of the Lodge; transmit a copy of the same to the Grand Lodge, if required; receive all moneys and money-bills from the hands of the brethren; pay them over to the Treasurer, and take his receipt for the same.\" Master to the Secretary, \"The Treasurer's place in the Lodge?\" A NS . \"At the right hand of the Wors hipful Master.\" Master to Treasurer, \"Your business there, Brother Treasure r?\" Treasurer answers, \"Duly to observe the Worshipful Master's will and pleasure; receive a ll moneys and money-bills from the hands of the Secretary; keep a just and accurate account of th e same; pay them out by order of the Worshipful Master and consent of the brethren.\" Master to th e Treasurer, \"The Junior Warden's place in the Lodge?\" A NS . \"In the South, Worshipful.\" Master to the Junior Warden, \"Your business there, Brother Junior?\" The Junior Warden says, \"As the sun in the South, at high meridian, is the beauty and glory of the day, so stands th e Junior Warden in the South at high twelve, the better to observe the time, call the crafts from labor to refreshm ent; superintend them during the hours thereof; see that none convert the purposes of refreshment into that of excess or inte mperance; call them on again in due season ; that the Worshipful Master may have honor, and they pleasure and profit thereby.\" The Master to the Junior Ward en, \"The Master's place in the Lodge?\" A NS . \"In the East, Worshipful.\" Master to Junior Warden, \"His duty there?\" A NS . \"As the sun rises in the East to open and adorn the day, so presides the Worshipful Mast er in the East, to open and adorn his Lodge, set his crafts to work with good and wholesome laws, or cause the same to be done.\" Master to the Junior Warden, \"The Senior Warden's place in the Lodge?\" A NS . \"In the West, Worshipful.\" Master to the Senior Warden, \"Your business there, Brothe r Senior?\" The Senior Warden replies, \"As the sun sets in the West to close th e day, so stands the Senior Warden in the West to assist the [Pg 14] Worshipful Master in opening an d closing the Lodge; take care of the jewels and implements; see that none be lost; pay th e craft their wages, if any be due; and see that none go away dissatisfied.\" The Master now gives three raps, when all the brethren rise, and the Master asks, \"Are you all satisfied?\" They answer in the affirma tive by giving the due-guar d.

Make us sensible of the renewed obligations we are under to love Thee supr emely, and to be friendly to each other. May all our irregular passions be subdued, a nd may we daily increase in fa ith, hope, and charity; but more especially in that charity which is the bond of peace, and [Pg 15] perfection of every virtue. May we so practice Thy precepts, that through the merits of the Redeemer we may finally obtain Thy promises, and find an acceptance through the gates and into the temple and city of our God. So mote it be. Amen.\" It is often that the prayer is neglected and the following benediction substituted: May the blessing of heaven rest upon us, and all regular Masons! May brot herly love prevail, and every moral and social virtue cement us. So mote it be. Amen. After the prayer the following charge ought to be delivered, but it is seldom attended to; in a majority of Lodges it is never atte nded to; Master to brethren, \"Bre thren, we are now about to quit this sacred retreat of friendship and virtue to mix again with the world. Amidst it s concerns and employments, forget not the duties which you have he ard so frequently inculcated, and so forcibly recommended in this Lodge. Remember that around this altar you have promised to befriend and relieve every brother who shall need your assist ance. You have promised in the most friendly manner to remind him of his errors and aid a reform ation. These generous principles are to extend further; every human being has a claim upon your kind offices. Do good unto all. Recommend it more 'especially to the household of the faithful. ' Finally, brethren, be ye all of one mind, live in peace, and may the God of love and peace delight to dwell w ith and bless you.\" In some Lodges, after the charge is delivered, th e Master says, \"Brethren, form on the square.\" Then all the brethren form a circle, and the Mast er, followed by every brothe r [except in using the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"words], says, \"And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.\" At the same moment that the last of these words drops from the Master's lips, every member stamps w ith his right foot on the floor, and at the same instant brings his hands toge ther with equal force, a nd in such perfect unison with each other, that persons situated so as to hear it would suppose it the precursor of some dreadful catastrophe. This is called \" THE SHOCK .\" The members of the Lodge then separate. The above comprises all the secret forms and ceremonies in a Lodge of Entered Apprentice Masons; but if the candidate would thoroughly unde rstand the whole, he must commit to memory the following \"Lecture.\" Very few do this except the officers of the Lodge. The \"Lecture\" is nothing more nor less than a recapitulation of the preceding ceremonies and forms by way of question and answer, in order fully to explai n the same. In fact, the ceremonies and forms (masonically called the WORK ) and Lecture are so much the same that he who possesses a knowledge of the Lecture cannot be destitute of a knowledge of what the ceremonies and forms are. The ceremonies used in opening and closi ng are the same in all the degrees. FIRST SECTION. L ECTURE ON THE F IRST D EGREE OF M ASONRY . Question—From whence came you as an Entered Apprentice Maso n?

By three di stinct knocks from w ithout, answered by the same from within. Q. What was said to you from within? A. Who comes there? Who comes there? Who comes there? Q. Your answer? A. A poor, blind candidate, who has long been desirous of having and receiving a part of the rights and benefits of this Worshipf ul Lodge, dedicated to G od, and held forth to the Holy Order of St. John, as all tr ue fellows and brothers have done , who have gone this way before me. Q. What further was said to you from within? A. I was asked if it was of my own free will and accord I made this request; if I was duly and trul y prepared, worthy and well qualified; all of which being answered in the affirmative, I was asked by what further rights I expected to obtain so great a favor or benefit. Q. Your answer? A. By being a man, free- born, of lawful age, and well recommended. Q. What was then said to you? A. I was bid to wait till the Worshipful Master in the East was made acquainted with my reque st and his answer returned. Q. After his answer was returned, what fo llowed? A. I was caused to enter the Lodge. Q. How? A. On the point of some sharp instrument pressing my naked left breast, in the name of the Lord. Q. How were you then disposed of? A.

Your answer? A. God. Q. What followed? A. The Worshipful Master to ok me by the right hand and said, Since in God you put your trust, arise, follow your leader, and fear no danger. Q. How were you then disposed of? A. I was conducted three times regu larly around the Lodge, and halted at the Junior Warden in the South, wh ere the same questions were asked, and answers returned at the door. Q. How did the Junior Warden dispose of you? A. He ordered me to be conducted to the Senior Warden in the West, where the same questions were asked, and answers returned as before. Q. How did the Senior Warden dispose of you? A. He ordered me to be conducted to the Worshipful Master in the East, where the same questions were asked, and answers returned as before, who likewise demanded of me from whence I came, and whither I was traveling. Q. Your answer? A. From the We st, and traveling to the East. Q. Why do you leave the West and travel to the East? A. In search of light. Q. How did the Worshipful Master then dispose of you? A. He or dered me to be conducted back to the West, from whence I came, and put in care of the Senior Warden, who taught me how to approach the East, the place of light, by advancing upon one upright regular step to the first step, my feet forming the right angle of an oblong square, my body erect at the altar before the Worshipful Master. Q. What did the Worshipful Master do with you? A. He made an Entered Apprentice Mason of me. Q. How? A. In due form."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Q. What was that due form? A. My left knee bare and bent, my right forming a square, my left hand supporting the Holy Bible, Square and Co mpass; I took upon me the solemn oath or obligation of an Entered Apprentice Mason. Q. After you had taken your obligation, what was said to you? A. I was asked what I most desired. Q. Your answer? A. Light. Q. Was you immediately brought to light? A. I was. Q. How? A. By the direction of the Master, and assistance of the brethren. Q. What did you first discover afte r being brought to light? A. Th ree great lights in Masonry, by the assistance of three lesser. Q. What were those three great lights in Masonr y? A. The Holy Bible, Square and Compass. Q. How are they explained? A. The Holy Bible is given to us as a guide for our faith and practice; the Square, to square our actions; and the Compass to keep us in due bounds with all mankind, but more especially with the brethren. Q. What were those three lesser lights? A. Three burning tapers, or candles on candlesticks. [Pg 18] Q. What do they represent? A. Th e Sun, Moon, and Master of the Lodge. Q. How are they explained? A. As the Sun ru les the day, and the Moon governs the night, so ought the Worshipful Master to use his endeavors to rule a nd govern his Lodge with equal regularity, or cause the same to be done. Q. What did you next discover? A. The Worshipf ul Master approaching me from the East, under the sign and due-guard of an Entered Apprentice Mason, who presented me with his right hand in token of brotherly love and est eem, and proceeded to give me the grip and word of an Entered Apprentice Mason, and bid me arise and salute the Junior and Senior Wardens, and convince them that I had been regularly initiated as an Ente red Apprentice Mason, and was in possession of the sign, grip, and word. Q. What did you next discover? A. The Worshipful Master a se cond time approaching me from the East, who presented me with a lamb-skin, or white apron, which he said was an emblem of innocence, and the badge of a Mason; that it had been worn by kings , princes, and potentates of the earth, who had never been ashamed to wear it; that it was more honorable than the diamonds of kings, or pearls of princesses, when worthily worn; and more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle; more honorable than the Star or Gart er, or any other order th at could be conferred on me at that time, or any time thereafter, except it be in the body of a just and lawfully constituted Lodge of Masons; and bid me carry it to the Seni or Warden in the West, who taught me how to wear it as an Ente red Apprentice Mason. Q. What were you next presented with? A. The working tools of an Entered Apprentice Mason. Q. What were they? A. The twenty -four-inch gauge and common gavel. Q. How were they explained? A. The twenty-fou r-inch gauge is an instrument made use of by operative masons to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for th e more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time; the twenty- four inches on the gauge are embl ematical of the twenty-four hours in the day, which we are taught so divide into three equal parts, whereby we fi nd eight hours for the service of God and a worthy distressed brother; eight hours for our usual vocation, and eight hours for refreshment and sleep. The common gavel is an instrument made use of by operative masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder's use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"taught to make use of it for th e more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds as lively and living stone for that spiritual buildi ng, that house not made with ha nds, eternal in the heavens. Q. What was you next presented with? A. A new name. Q. What was it? A. Caution. [Pg 19] Q. What does it teach? A. It teaches me, as I was barely instructed in the rudiments of Masonry, that I should be cautious over all my words and actions, especially when before its enemies. Q. What were you next presented with? A. Three precious jewels. Q. What were they? A. A listening ear, a silent tongue, and a faithful heart. Q. What do they teach? A. A listening ear teach es me to listen to th e instructions of the Worshipful Master, but more especially that I should listen to the calls and cries of a worthy distressed brother. A silent tongue teaches me to be silent in the Lodge, that the peace and harmony thereof may not be disturbed; but more especially that I should be silent when before the enemies of Masonry. A faithful heart, that I should be faithful to the instructions of the Worshipful Master at all times; but more especially that I should be fa ithful and keep and conceal the secrets of Masonry, and those of a brother, when delivered to me in ch arge as such, that they may remain as secure and inviolable in my breast as in hi s own, before communicated to me. Q. What was you next presente d with? A. Check-words two. Q. What were they? A. Truth and Union. Q. How explained? A. Truth is a divine attribut e, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true are the first lessons we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct; hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown amongst us; sincerity and plain d ealing distinguish us; and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other's welfare, and rejoicing in each other's prosperity. Union is that kind of friendship that ought to ap pear conspicuous in the conduct of every Mason. It is so closely allied to the divine attribute, trut h, that he who enjoys the one, is seldom destitute of the other. Should interest, honor, pr ejudice, or human depravity ever influence you to violate any part of the sacred trust we now repose in you, let these two impor tant words, at the earliest insinuation, teach you to put on the check-line of tr uth, which will infallibly direct you to pursue that straight and narrow path which ends in the full enjoyment of the Grand Lodge above, where we shall all meet as Masons and members of one family; where all discord on account of religion, politics, or private opinion, shall be u nknown and banished from within our walls. Q. What followed? A. The Worshipf ul Master in the East made a demand of me of something of a metallic kind, which, he said, was not so much on acc ount of its intrinsic value, as that it might be deposited in the archives of the Lodge as a me morial that I had here in been made a Mason. Q. How did the Worshipful Master then dispose of you? A. He ordered me to be conducted out of the Lodge and invested of what I had been divested, and return for further instruction. Q. After you returned, how was you disposed of? A. I was conducted to the northeast corner of the Lodge, and there caused to stand upright like a man, my feet forming a square , and received a solemn injunction, ever to walk and act uprigh tly before God and man, and in addition thereto received too following charge. [For this charge see pages 10-12.] "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" [Pg 20] SECOND SECTION. Question—Why was you divested of all metals when you was made a Mason? Answer— Because Masonry regards no man on account of his wo rldly wealth or honors; it is therefore the internal, and not the external qualifica tions that recommend a man to Masons. Q. A second reason? A. There was neither the so und of an axe, hammer, or any other metal tool heard at the building of King Solomon's Temple. Q. How could so stupendous a fabric be erected without the sound of axe, hammer, or any other metal tool? A. All the stones were hewed, square d, and numbered in the quarries where they were raised, all the timbers felled and prepared in th e forests of Lebanon, and carried down to Joppa on floats, and taken from thence up to Jerusalem a nd set up with wooden mauls, prepared for that purpose; which, when completed, every part thereof fitted with that exact nicety, that it had more the resemblance of the handy workmanship of the Supreme Architect of the Universe than of human hands. Q. Why was you neither naked nor cl othed? A. As I was an object of distress at that time, it was to remind me, if ever I saw a friend, more especially a brother, in a like di stressed situation, that I should contribute as liberally to his relief as hi s situation required, and my abilities would admit, without material injury to myself or family. Q. Why was you neither barefoot nor shod? A. It was an ancien t Israelitish custom adopted among Masons; and we read in th e Book of Ruth concerning their mode and manner of changing and redeeming, and to confirm all things, a brother plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor, and that was testimony in Israel. This, then, theref ore, we do in confirmation of a token, and as a pledge of our fidelity; therefore signifying that we will renounce our own will in all things, and become obedient to the laws of our ancient institutions. Q. Why was you hoodwinked? A. Th at my heart might conceive before my eyes beheld the beauties of Masonry. Q. A second reason? A. As I was in darkness at that time, it was to remind me that I should keep the whole world so respecting Masonry. Q. Why had you a cable-tow about your neck? A. In case I had not submitted to the manner and mode of my initiation, that I mi ght have been led out of the L odge without seeing the form and beauties thereof. Q. Why did you give three distinct knocks at the door? A. To alarm the Lodge, and let the Worshipful Master, Wardens and brethren know that a poor blind candidate prayed admission. Q. What do those three distinct knocks allude to? A. A certain passage in Scripture wherein it says, \"Ask and it shall be given, seek and ye shall find, knock and it sh all be opened unto you.\" Q. How did you apply this to your then case in Masonry? A. I asked the recommendation of a friend to become a Mason; I sought admission th rough his recommendations and knocked, and the door of Masonry opened unto me. Q. Why was you caused to enter on the point of so me sharp instrument pr essing your naked left breast in the name of the Lord? A. As [Pg 21] this was a torture to my flesh, so might the recollection of it ever be to my flesh and conscience, if ever I attempted to reveal the secrets of Masonry unlawfully."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Q. Why was you conducted to the centre of the L odge, and there caused to kneel for the benefit of a prayer? A. Before entering on this, or any other great and important undertaking, it is highly necessary to implore a blessing from Deity. Q. Why was you asked in whom you put your trust? A. Agreeably to the laws of our ancient institution, no Atheist could be made a Mason; it was, therefore, ne cessary that I should believe in Deity; otherwise, no oath or obligation could bind me. Q. Why did the Worshipful Master take you by the right hand and bid you rise, follow your leader, and fear no danger? A. As I was in darkness at that time, a nd could neither forsee nor avoid danger, it was to remind me that I was in the hands of an affectionate friend, in whose fidelity I might with safety confide. Q. Why was you conducted three times regularly round the Lodge? A. Th at the Worshipful Master, Wardens and brethren might s ee that I was duly and truly prepared. Q. Why did you meet with those several obstruc tions on the way? A. This, and every other Lodge is, or ought to be, a true representation of King Solomon's Temple, which, when completed, had guards stationed at the Ea st, West, and South gates. Q. Why had they guards stationed at those severa l gates? A. To prevent any one from passing or repassing that was not duly qualified. Q. Why did you kneel on your left knee and not on your right, or both? A. The left side has ever been considered the weakest part of the body; it wa s, therefore, to remind me that that part I was then taking upon me was the weakest part of Masonr y, it being that only of an Entered Apprentice. Q. Why was your right hand placed on the Holy Bibl e, Square and Compass, and not your left, or both? A. The right hand has ever been considered the seat of fidelity, and our ancient brethren worshipped Deity under the name of F IDES , which has sometimes been represented by two right hands joined together; at others, by two human figures holding each other by the right hand; the right hand, therefore, we use in this great and im portant undertaking, to si gnify, in the strongest manner possible, the sincerity of our inte ntions in the business we are engaged. Q. Why did the Worshipful Master present you with a lamb-skin, or a white apron? A. The lamb- skin has, in all ages, been deem ed an emblem of innocence; he, th erefore, who wears the lamb-skin, as a badge of a Mason, is thereb y continually reminded of that purity of life and rectitude of conduct, which is so essentially necessary to ou r gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. Q. Why did the Master make a demand of you of so mething of a metallic nature? A. As I was in a poor and penniless situation at the time, it was to remind me if ever I saw a friend, but more especially a brother, [Pg 22] in a like poor and penniless situation, th at I should contribu te as liberally to his relief as my abilities would admit and his situation required, wit hout injuring myself or family. Q. Why was you conducted to the northeast corn er of the Lodge, and there caused to stand upright, like a man, your feet form ing a square, receiving, at the same time, a solemn charge to walk and act uprightly before G od and man? A. The first stone in every Masonic edifice is, or ought to be, placed at th e northeast corner; that being the place where an Entered Apprentice Mason receives his first instructions to build his future Masonic edifice upon. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THIRD SECTION. Question—We have been saying a good deal about a Lodge, I want to know what constitutes a Lodge? Answer—A certain number of Free and A ccepted Masons, duly assembled in a room or place, with the Holy Bible, Square and Compass, and other Masonic Implements, with a charter from the Grand Lodge, empowering them to work. Q. Where did our ancient brethren meet before L odges were erected? A. On the highest hills, and in the lowest vales. Q. Why on the highest hills and in the lowest vale s? A.

Has your Lodge any furniture? A. It has; the Holy Bible, Square, and Compass. Q. To whom do they belong? A. The Bible to God; the Square to the Master; and the Compass to the Craft. Q. How explained? A. The Bibl e to God, it being the inestimable gift of God to man for his instruction, to guide him through the rugged paths of life; the Square to the Master, it being the proper emblem of [Pg 23] his office: the Compass to the Craft; by a due attention to which we are taught to limit our desires, curb our ambition, s ubdue our irregular appetites, and keep our passions and prejudices in due bounds with all mankind, but more especially with the brethren. Q. Has your Lodge any ornaments? A. It has; the Mosaic, or ch eckered pavement; the indented tressel; that beautiful tesselated border which surrounds it, wi th the blazing star in the centre. Q. What do they represent? A. The Mosaic, or checkered pavement, represents this world; which, though checkered over with good and evil, yet brethren may walk toge ther thereon and not stumble; the indented tressel, with the blazing star in the centre, the manifold blessings and comforts with which we are surrounded in this li fe, but more especially those which we hope to enjoy hereafter; the blazing star, that prudence which ought to appear conspicuous in the conduct of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"every Mason, but more especially commemorative of the star which appeared in the East to guide the wise men to Bethlehem, to proclaim th e birth and the presence of the Son of God. Q. Has your Lodge any lights? A. It has; three. Q. How are they situated? A. East, West, and South. Q. Has it none in the North? A. It has not. Q. Why so? A. Because this and every other Lodge is, or ought to be, a true representation of King Solomon's Temple, which was situated Nort h of the ecliptic ; the Sun and Mo on, therefore, darting their rays from the South, no light was to be expected from the North; we, therefore, Masonically, term the North a place of darkness. Q. Has your Lodge any jewels? A. It has; six; three movable and three immovable. Q. What are the three movable jewels ? A. The Square, Level, and Plumb. Q. What do they teach? A. The Square, morality; th e Level, equality; and the Plumb, rectitude of life and conduct. Q. What are the three immova ble jewels? A. The rough Ashlar , the perfect Ashlar, and the Tressel-Board. Q. What are they? A. The rough Ashlar is a stone in its rough and natural state; the perfect Ashlar is also a stone, made rea dy by the working tools of the Fellow Craft to be adjusted in the building; and the Tressle-Board is for the mast er workman to draw his plans and designs upon. Q. What do they represent? A. The rough Ashlar represents man in his rude and imperfect state by nature; the perfect Ashlar also represents man in that state of perfection to which we all hope to arrive, by means of a virtuous life and education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God. In erecting our temporal building, we pursue the plans and designs la id down by the master workman on his Tressle-Board: but in erecting our spiritual building, we pursue the plans and designs laid down by the Supreme Geometrician of the Universe , in the Book of Life, which we, Masonically, term our spiritual Tressle-Board. Q. Who did you serve? A. My Master. Q. How long? A. Six days. [Pg 24] Q. What did you serve him with? A. Freedom, Fervency, and Zeal. Q. What do they represent? A. Chalk, Charcoal, and Earth. Q. Why so? A. There is nothing freer than chal k, the slightest touch of which leaves a trace behind; nothing more fervent than heated charco al; it will melt the most obdurate metals; nothing more zealous than the earth to bring forth. Q. How is your Lodge situat ed? A. Due East and West. Q. Why so? A. Because the Sun rises in the East and sets in the West. Q. A second reason? A. The gospel was first preach ed in the East and is spreading to the West. Q. A third reason? A. The liberal arts and scien ces began in the East and are extending to the West. Q. A fourth reason? A. Because all the churches and chapels are, or ought to be, so situated. Q. Why are all churches and chapels so situat ed? A. Because King Solomon's Temple was so situated."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Q. Why was King Solomon's Temple so situat ed? A. Because Moses, after conducting the children of Israel thr ough the Red Sea, by divine command, er ected a tabernacle to God, and placed it due East and West, which was to commemorate, to the latest poster ity, that miraculous East wind that wrought their mighty delivera nce; and this was an exact m odel of Solomon's Temple; since which time, every well regulated and governed Lodge is, or ought to be, so situated. Q. To whom did our ancient brethren de dicate their Lodges? A. To King Solomon. Q. Why so? A. Because King Solomon was our most ancient Grand Master. Q. To whom do modern Masons dedicate their L odges? A. To St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist. Q. Why so? A. Because they were the two most ancient Christian patrons of Masonry; and, since their time, in every well-regulated and governed Lodge there has been a certain point within a circle, which circle is bounded on the East and the West by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing the anniversary of St. John the Baptist and St. J ohn the Evangelist, who were two perfect parallels, as well in Mas onry as Christianity, on the vertex of which rests the Book of the Holy Scriptures, supporting Jacob's Ladder, whic h is said to reach the watery clouds, and, in passing round this circle, we naturally touch on bot h these perpendicular parallel lines, as well as the Book of the Holy Scriptures; and while a Ma son keeps himself thus circumscribed, he cannot materially err. END OF THE LECTURE, AND OF THE FIRST DEGREE. It is proper to add here that ve ry few Masons ever learn the Lect ure. Of course, it is necessary that the officers of the Lodge should understand thei r own particular part, a nd that is generally all they learn. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE SECOND OR FELLOW CRAFT MASON'S DEGREE. This degree is usually called \"passing.\" The ceremonies of opening and closing the Lodge are precisely the same as in the first degree; except two [Pg 25] knocks are used in this degree, and the door is entered by the benef it of a pass-word. It is S HIBBOLETH , and explained in the Lecture. The candidate, as before, is taken into the preparatio n room and prepared in the manner following: All his clothing taken off, except his sh irt; furnished with a pair of dr awers; his right breast bare; his left foot in a slipper; the right bare; a cable-t ow twice 'round his neck; se mi-hoodwinked; in which situation he is conducted to the door of the Lodge, where he gives two knocks, when the Senior Warden rises and says, \"Worshipful, while we are peaceably at work on the second degree of Masonry, under the influence of faith, hope, and char ity, the door of our Lodge is alarmed.\" Master to Junior Deacon, \"Brother Junior , inquire the cause of that alar m.\" [In many Lodges they come to the door, knock, are answered by the Junior Deacon, and come in without being noticed by the Senior Warden or Master.] The Junior Deacon gives two raps on the inside of the door. The candidate gives one without. It is answered by the Junior Deacon with one; when the door is partly opened by the Junior Deacon, who inquires, \"Who comes here? Who comes here?\" The Senior Deacon, who is, or ought to be, the conductor, answers, \"A worthy br other, who has been regularly initiated as an Entered Apprentice Mason, served a proper time as such, and now wishes for further light in Masonry, by being passed to the degree of Fellow Craft.\" Ju nior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"Is it of his own free will and accord he makes this request?\" Se nior Deacon replies, \"It is.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"Is he duly and truly prepared?\" A NS . \"He is.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"Is he worthy and well qualified?\" A NS . \"He is.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"Has he made suitable proficiency in the preceding degree?\" A NS . \"He has.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"By what further rights does he expect to obtain this benefit?\" A NS . \"By the benefit of a pass-word.\" Junior Deacon to Seni or Deacon, \"Has he a pass-word?\" A NS . \"He has not, but I have it for him.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"Give it to me.\" The Senior Deacon whispers in the Junior Deacon's ear, \" S HIBBOLETH . \" The Junior Deacon says, \"The pa ss is right; since this is the case, you will wait until the Worshi pful Master in the East is made acquainted with his request, and his answer returned.\" The Junior Deacon then repa irs to the Master and gi ves two knocks, as at the door, which are answered by two by the Master; when the same questions are asked, and answers returned, as at the door . After which, the Master says, \"Sin ce he comes endued with all these necessary qualifications, let him en ter this Worshipful Lodge in the name of the Lord, and take heed on what he enters.\" He enters; the angle of the Square is pressed hard against his naked right breast, at which time the Junior Deacon says, \"Bro ther, when you entered this Lodge the first time, you entered on the point of the Co mpass pressing your naked left br east, which was then explained to you. You now enter it on the angle of the Square , pressing your naked right breast; which is to teach you to act upon the square with all mankind, but more especially with the brethren.\" The candidate is then conducted twice regularly 'round the Lodge and halte d at the Junior Warden in the South, where he gives two raps, and is [Pg 26] answered by two, when the same questions are asked, and answers returned as at the door ; from thence he is conducted to the Senior Warden, where the same questions are asked, and answers returned as be fore; he is then conducted to the Master in the East, where the same questions are asked, and answ ers returned as before; the Master likewise demands of him from whence he ca me, and whither he was traveling; he answers, \"From the West, and traveling to the East.\" The Master says, \"W hy do you leave the West, and travel to the East?\" The candidate answers, \"In search of more light.\" The Master th en says to the Senior Deacon, \"Since this is the case, you will please conduct the candidate back to the West, from whence he came, and put him in the care of the Senior Warden, who will teach him how to approach the East, 'the place of light,' by advancing upon two upright regul ar steps to the second step (his heel is in the hollow of the right foot in this degree), his feet forming the right angle of an oblong square, and his body erect at the altar before the Worshipful Master, and place him in a proper position to take the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"solemn oath or obligation of a Fellow Craft Ma son.\" The Master then leaves his seat and approaches the kneeling candidate (the candidate kneels on the right knee, the left forming a square; his left arm, as far as th e elbow, in a horizontal position, and the rest of the arm in a vertical position, so as to form a square; his arm supporte d by the Square held under his elbow), and says, \"Brother, you are now placed in a proper position to take on you the solemn oath or obligation of a Fellow Craft Mason, which, I assure you, as before, is neither to affect your religion nor politics; if you are willing to take it, repe at your name, and say after me: \"I, A. B., of my own free will and accord, in th e presence of Almighty God, and this Worshipful Lodge of Fellow Craft Masons, dedicated to God, and held forth to the Holy Order of St. John, do hereby and hereon most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, in addition to my former obligation, that I will not give the degree of a Fellow Craft Mason to any one of an inferior degree, nor to any one being in the known world, except it be to a true and lawful brother, or brethren Fellow Craft Masons, or within the body of a just and lawfully constituted Lodge of such; and not unto him nor unto them whom I shall hear so to be, but unto him and them only whom I shall find so to be, after strict trial and due examination, or lawful information. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not wrong this Lodge, nor a brother of this degree, to the value of two cents, knowingly, myself, nor suffer it to be done by others, if in my power to prevent it. Furt hermore, do I promise and swear, that I will support the Constitution of the Grand Lodge of the United States, and of the Grand Lodge of this State, under which this Lodge is held, and conform to all the by- laws, rules, and regulations of this, or any other Lodge, of which I may at any time hereafter become a member, as far as in my power. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will obey all regular signs and summons given, handed, sent, or thrown to me by the hand of a brother Fellow Craft Mason, or from the body of a just and lawfully constituted Lodge of such; provided it be within the length of my cable-tow, or a square and angle of my work. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will be aiding and assisting all poor and penniless brethren Fellow Crafts, their widows and orphans, wheresoever disposed 'round the globe, they applying to me as such, as far as in my power, without injuring myself or family. To all which I do most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, without the least hesita tion, mental reservation, or self-evasion of mind in me whatever; binding myself under no [Pg 27] less penalty than to have my left breast torn open, and my heart and vitals taken from thence and thrown over my left shoulder, and carried into the valley of Jehosaphat, there to become a prey to the wild beasts of the fields, and vultures of the air, if ever I should prove wilfully guilty of violating any part of this my solemn oath or obligation of a Fellow Craft Mason; so keep me God, and keep me steadfast in the due performance of the same.\" The Master then says, \"Detach your hands and kiss the book, which is the Holy Bible, twice.\" The bandage is now (by one of the brethren) dropped ov er the other eye, and the Master says, \"Brother (at the same time laying his hand on the top of the candidate's head), what do you most desire?\" The candidate answers, after his prompter , \"More light.\" The Master says, \"Brethren, form on the square, and assist in bringing our new-made brother from darkness to light; 'And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.'\" At this in stant all the brethren clap their hands, and stamp on the floor, as in the preceding degree. The Mast er says to the candidate, \"Brother, what do you discover different from before?\" The Master says, after a short pa use, \"You now discover one point of the Compass elevated above the Square, which denot es light in this degree; but as one is yet in obscurity, it is to remind you that you are yet one material point in the dark respecting Masonry.\" The Master steps off from the candidate three or four steps, and says, \"B rother, you now discover me as a Master of this Lodge, approaching you from the East, under the sign and due-guard of a Fellow Craft Mason; do as I do, as near as you can, keeping your position.\" The sign is given by drawing your right hand flat, with the palm of it next to your br east, across your breast, from the left to the right side, with some quickness, and dropping it down by your si de; the due-guard is given by raising the left arm until that part of it between the elbow a nd shoulder is perfectly"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"horizontal, and raising the rest of the arm in a vert ical position, so that that part of the arm below the elbow, and that part above it, forms a square ; this is called the due- guard of a Fellow Craft Mason. The two given together ar e called the sign and due-guard of a Fellow Craft Mason, and they are never given separate; they would not be recognized by a Mason if given separately. The Master, by the time he gives hi s steps, sign, and due-guard, arri ves at the candidate, and says, \"Brother, I now present you with my right hand, in token of brot herly love and confidence, and with it the pass-grip and word of a Fellow Craft Mason.\" The pass, or more properly the pass-grip, is given by taking each other by the right hand, as though going to shake hands, and each putting his thumb between the fore and second finger, wher e they join the hands, and pressing the thumb between the joints. This is the pass-grip of a Fellow Craft Mason; the name of it is S HIBBOLETH . Its origin will be explained in the Lecture; the pass-grip some gi ve without lettering or syllabling, and others give it in the same way they do the real gr ip. The real grip of a Fe llow Craft Mason is given by putting the thumb on the joint of the second finger, where it joins th e hand, and crooking your thumb so that each can stick the nail of his thumb into the joint of the other. This is the real grip of a Fellow Craft Mason; the name of it is J ACHIN ; it is given in the following manner: If [Pg 28] you wish to examine a person, after having taken each ot her by the grip, ask him, \"What is this?\" A. \"A grip.\" Q. \"A grip of what?\" A. \"T he grip of a Fellow Craft Mason.\" Q. \"Has it a name?\" A. \"It has.\" Q. \"Will you give it to me?\" A. \"I did not so receive it, neither can I so impart it.\" Q. \"What will you do with it?\" A. \"I'll letter it or halve it.\" Q. \"Halve it, and you begin.\" A. \"No; begin you.\" Q. \"You begin.\" A. \"JA.\" Q. \"CHIN.\" A. \"JACHIN.\" Q. \"Right, Brother J ACHIN , I greet you.\" After the Master gives the candidate the pass-grip and grip, and their names, he says, \"Brother, you will rise and salute the Junior and Senior Wa rdens as such, and convince them that you have been regularly passed to the degr ee of a Fellow Craft Mason, and have got the sign and pass-grip, real grip, and their names.\" [I do not here expre ss it as expressed in Lodge s generally; the Master usually says you will rise and salute the Warden s, &c., and convince them, &c., that you have got the sign, pass-grip, and word. It is obviously wrong, b ecause the first thing he gives is the sign, then the due-guard, then the pass-grip, and their names.] While the Wardens are examining the candidate, the Master gets an apron, and returns to the candidate, and says, \"Brother, I now have the honor of presenting you with a lamb-skin, or white apron, as before, which I hope you will continue to wear, with honor to yourself, and satisfaction to the brethren ; you will please carry it to the Senior Warden in the West, who will teach you how to wear it as a Fellow Craft Mason.\" The Senior Warden ties on his apron, and turns up one corn er of the lower end of the apron, and tucks it under the apron string. The Senior Deacon then c onducts his pupil to the Master, who has by this time resumed his seat in the East, where he has, or ought to have, the floor carp et to assist him in his explanations. Master to the candidate, \"Brother, as you are dr essed, it is necessary you should have tools to work with; I will, therefore, present you with the tool s of a Fellow Craft Mason. They are the Plumb, Square, and Level. The Plumb is an instrument made use of by operative masons to raise perpendiculars; the Square, to square their work; and the Level, to lay horizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use th em for more noble and glorious purposes; the Plumb teaches us to walk uprightly, in our seve ral stations, before God and man; squaring our actions by the square of virtue; a nd remembering that we are traveling on the level of time to that 'undiscovered country, from whose bourne no traveler has returned.' I furthe r present you with three precious jewels; their names are Faith, Hope, and Char ity; they teach us to ha ve faith in God, hope in immortality, and charity to all mankind.\" Th e Master to the Senior Deacon, \"You will now conduct the candidate out of this Lodge, and invest him with what he has been divested.\" After he is clothed, and the necessary arrangements made for his reception, such as placing the columns and floor carpet, if they have any, a nd the candidate is reconducted back to the Lodge; as he enters the door, the Senior Deacon observes, \"We are now a bout to return to the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple.\" When within the door, the Seni or Deacon proceeds, \"Brother, we have worked [Pg 29] in speculative Masonry, but our forefathers wrought both in specu lative and operative"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Masonry. They worked at the building of Ki ng Solomon's Temple, and many other Masonic edifices; they wrought six days; they did not work on the seventh, because in six days God created the heavens and the earth, and rested on the seve nth day. The seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest; thereby enjoying more frequent oppor tunities to contemplate the glorious works of creation, a nd to adore their great Creator.\" Moving a step or two, the Senior Deacon proceeds, \"Brother, the first thing that at tracts our attention are two large columns, or pillars, one on the left hand, and the other on th e right; the name of the one on the left hand is B OAZ , and denotes strength; the name of the one on the right hand is J ACHIN , and denotes establishment; they collectively allude to a passag e in Scripture, wherein God has declared in his word, 'In strength shall this house be established.' These columns ar e eighteen cubits high, twelve in circumference, and four in diameter; they ar e adorned with two large chapiters, one on each, and these chapiters are ornamented with net work, lily work, and pomegranates; they denote unity, peace, and plenty. The net work, from its connec tion, denotes union; the lily work, from its whiteness, purity and peace; and the pomegranate, from the exuberance of its seed, denotes plenty. They also have two large globes, or balls, on e on each; these globes or balls contain, on their convex surfaces, all the maps and charts of the celes tial and terrestrial bodies ; they are said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Mas onry, and that a Mason's char ity ought to be equally extensive. Their composition is molten, or cast br ass; they were cast on the banks of the river Jordan, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zaradatha, where King Solomon ordered these and all other holy vessels to be cast; they were cast hollow; and were four inches, or a hand's breadth thick; they were cast hollow, the better to withstand i nundations and conflagrat ions; they were the archives of Masonry, and containe d the constitution, rolls, and reco rds.\" The Senior Deacon having explained the columns, he passes between them, advances a step or two, observing as he advances, \"Brother, we will pursue our travel s; the next thing that we come to is a long, winding staircase, with three, five, seven steps, or more. The thr ee first allude to the th ree principal supports in Masonry, viz., wisdom, strength, and beauty; the five steps allude to the five orders in architecture, and the five human senses; the five orders in arch itecture are the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite; the five human senses are Heari ng, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting; the three first of which have ever been highly esse ntial among Masons: Hearing, to hear the word; Seeing, to see the sign; and Feeli ng, to feel the gri p, whereby one Mason may know another in the dark as well as in the light. The seven steps all ude to the seven sabbatical years; seven years of famine; seven years in building the temple; seven golden candlesticks; seven wonders of the world; seven planets; but more especially the seven liberal arts and sciences, which are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy; for this, and many other reasons, the number seven has ever been held in high [Pg 30] estimation among Masons.\" Advancing a few steps, the Senior Deacon proceeds, \"Brother, the ne xt thing we come to is the outer door of the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple, which is partly open, but closel y tyled by the Junior Warden\" [It is the Junior Warden in the South w ho represents the Tyler at the outer door of the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple], w ho, on the approach of the Senior Deacon and candidate, inquires, \"Who comes here? Who comes here?\" The Senior Deacon answers, \"A Fellow Craft Mason.\" Junior Warden to Senior Deacon, \"H ow do you expect to gain admission?\" A. \"By a pass, and token of a pass.\" Junior Warden to Senior Deacon, \"Will you give them to me?\" [The Senior Deacon, or the candidate (prompted by him), gives them; th is and many other tokens, or grips, are frequently given by strangers when first in troduced to each other. If given to a Mason, he will immediately return it; they can be given in any company unobserved, even by Masons, when shaking hands. A PASS , AND TOKEN OF A PASS ; the pass is the word S HIBBOLETH ; the token, alias the pass-grip, is given, as before described, by taking each other by the right hand, as if shaking hands, and placing the thumb between the forefinger and s econd finger, at the third joint, or where they join the hand, and pressing it hard enough to attract attention. In the Lecture it is called a token, but"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"generally called the pass-grip. It is an undenia ble fact that Masons express themselves so differently, when they mean the same thing, that they frequently wholly misunderstand each other.] After the Junior Warden has received the pass S HIBBOLETH , he inquires, \"What does it denote?\" A. \"Plenty.\" Junior Warden to Senior Deacon, \"Why so?\" A. \"From an ear of corn being placed at the water-ford.\" Junior Warden to Senior Deacon, \"Why was this pass instituted?\" A. \"In consequence of a quarrel which had long existe d between Jephthah, Judge of Israel, and the Ephraimites, the latter of whom had long been a stubbor n, rebellious people, whom Jephthah had endeavored to subdue by lenient measures, but to no effect. The Ephraimites being highly incensed against Jephthah, for not being called to fight and share in the rich spoils of the Ammonitish war, assembled a mighty army, and passed over the river Jo rdan to give Jephthah battle; but he, being apprised of their approach, called together the men of Israel, and gave them battle, and put them to flight; and to make his victory more complete, he ordered guards to be placed at the different passes on the banks of the river Jordan, and commanded, if the Ephraimites passed that way, that they should pronounce the word S HIBBOLETH ; but they, being of a di fferent tribe, pronounced it S IBBOLETH , which trifling defect proved them spies, and cost them their lives; and there fell that day, at the different passes on the banks of the river Jordan, forty and two thousand. This word was also used by our ancient brethren to distinguish a friend from a foe, and has since been adopted as a proper pass-word, to be given be fore entering any well-regulate d and governed Lodge of Fellow Craft Masons.\" Since this is the case, you will pass on to the Senior Warden in the West for further examination. As they approach the Senior Warden in the West, the Senior Deacon says to the candidate, \"Brother, the next thing we [Pg 31] come to is the inner door of the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple, which we find partly open, but more closely tyled by the Senior Warden;\" when the Senior Warden inquires, \"Who come s here? Who comes here?\" The Senior Deacon answers, \"A Fellow Craft Mason.\" Senior Warden to Senior Deac on, \"How do you expect to gain admission?\" A. \"By the grip and word.\" The Senior Warden to the Senior Deacon, \"Will you give them to me?\" They are then given as hereinbefore described. The word is J ACHIN . After they are given, the Senior Warden says, \"They are right; you can pass on to the Worshipful Master in the East.\" As they approach the Master, he inqu ires, \"Who comes here? W ho comes here?\" Senior Deacon answers, \"A Fellow Craft Mason.\" The Mast er then says to the candidate, \"Brother you have been admitted into the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple for the sake of the letter G. It denotes Deity, before whom we all ought to bow with reverence, worship, and adoration. It also denotes Geometry, the fifth scienc e: it being that on which this degree was principally founded. By Geometry we may curiously trace nature thro ugh her various windings to her most concealed recesses; by it we may discover the power, the wi sdom, and the goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delig ht the proportions which connect this vast machine; by it we may discover how the planets move in their different orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions; by it we account for the return of a season, and the va riety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds surround us , all formed by the same Divine Architect, which roll through this vast expanse, and all c onducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of nature, and the observations of her beau tiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the divine plan, and study symmetry and order. Th e architect began to desi gn; and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of i gnorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuab le monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrate d artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. The ATTENTIVE EAR received the sound from the INSTRUCTIVE TONGUE ; and the mysteries of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the repository of FAITHFUL BREASTS . Tools and implements of architecture, and symbolic emblems, most expressive, are selected by the fraternity"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"to imprint on the mind wise and serious truths ; and thus, through a succession of ages, are transmitted, unimpaired, the most excellent tenets of our institution.\" Here the labor ends of the Fellow Craft's degr ee. It will be observed that the candidate has received, in this place, the second section of the Lecture on this degree. This course is not generally pursued, but it is much the most instructive met hod; and when it is omitt ed, I generally conclude that it is for want of a knowledge of the Lecture. Monitorial wr iters (who are by no means coeval with Masonry) all write, or copy, very much after each other, and they have all inserted in their books all [Pg 32] those clauses of the several Lectures whic h are not considered by the wise ones as tending to develop the secrets of Masonry. In some instances, they change the phra seology a little; in others, they are literal extracts from the Lectures . This, it is said, is done to facilitate the progress of learners, or young Masons; when, in fact, it has the contrary effect. The following charge is, or ought to be, delivered to the candidate after he has got through the ceremonies; but he is generally told, \"It is in the Monitor, and you can learn it at your leisure.\" \"Brother, being advanced to the second de gree of Masonry, we c ongratulate you on your preferment. The internal, and not the external, qualifications of a man are what Masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge, you will improve in social intercourse. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Mason, you are bound to discharge; or enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experience must have es tablished their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support; and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate or aggravate the o ffences of your brethren; but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to ju dge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education, which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration; especially the science of Geometry, which is esta blished as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally synonymous term s, being of a divine moral natu re, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the wonderful pr operties of nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. Y our past behavior and regular de portment have merited the honor which we have now conferred, and, in your new char acter, it is expected that you will conform to the principles of the Order, by steadily persevering in the pract ice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your engagements as a Fellow Craft, and to these duties you are bound by the most sacred ties.\" I will now proceed with the L ecture on this degree; it is divided into two sections. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"FIRST SECTION. Question—Are you a Fellow Craft Mason? A. I am; try me. Q. By what will you be tried? A. By the Square. Q. Why by the Square? A.

In a ro om adjacent to the body of a just and lawfully constitute d Lodge of such, duly assembled in a room or place, representing the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple. Q. How was you prepared? A. By being divested of all metals; neither naked nor clothed; barefooted nor shod; hoodwinked; with a [Pg 33] cable-tow twice 'round my neck; in which situation I was conducted to the door of the L odge, where I gave two distinct knocks. Q. What did those two distinct knocks allude to? A. To the second de gree in Masonry, it being that on which I was about to enter. Q. What was said to you from within? A. Who comes there? Who comes there? Q. Your answer? A. A worthy brother, who has been regularly initiated as an Entered Apprentice Mason; served a proper time as such; and now wish es for further light in Masonry, by being passed to the degree of a Fellow Craft. Q. What was then said to you from within? A. I was asked if it was of my own free will and accord I made this request; if I was duly and truly prepared, worthy and well qualified; and had made suitable proficiency in the preceding degree; a ll of which being answered in the affirmative, I was asked by what further rights I exp ected to obtain so great a benefit. Q. Your answer? A. By the benefit of a pass-word. Q. What is that pass-word? A. S HIBBOLETH . Q. What further was said to you fr om within? A. I was bid to wait till the Worshipful Master in the East was made acquainted with my request and his answer returned. Q. After his answer was returned, what fo llowed? A. I was caused to enter the Lodge. Q. How did you enter? A. On the angle of the Square pr esented to my naked right breast, in the name of the Lord. Q. How were you then disposed of? A. I was conducted twice regularly around the Lodge, and halted at the Junior Warden in the South, where the same ques tions were asked, and answers returned as at the door. Q. How did the Junior Warden dispose of you? A. He ordered me to be conducted to the Senior Warden in the West, where the same questions were asked, and answers returned as before. Q.

My right knee bare bent; my left knee forming a square; my right hand on the Holy Bible, Square, and Compa ss; my left arm forming an angle, supported by the Square, and my hand in a vert ical position; in which posture I took upon me the solemn oath, or obligation, of a Fellow Craft Mason. [See pages 26 and 27 for obligation.] Q. After your oath, or obligation, what was said to you? A. I was asked what I most desired. Q. Your answer? A. More light. Q. On being brought to light, what did you discover different from before? A. One point of the Compass elevated above the Square, which denoted li ght in this degree; but as one point was yet in obscurity, it was to remind me that I was yet one material point in the dark respecting Masonry. Q. What did you next discover? A. The Worshipf ul Master approaching me from the East, under the sign and due-guard of a Fellow Craft Mason, who presented me with his right hand in token of brotherly love and confidence, and proceeded to gi ve me the pass-grip and word of a Fellow Craft Mason, and bid me arise and salute the Junior and Senior Wardens, and convince them that I had been regularly passed to the degree of a Fellow Craft, and ha d the sign, grip, and word of a Fellow Craft Mason. Q. What next did you discover? A. The Worshipful Master appr oaching me a second time from the East, who presented me a lamb-skin, or white apron, which, he said, he hoped I would continue to wear with honor to myself and sati sfaction and advantage to my brethren. Q. What was you next presented with? A. Th e working tools of a Fellow Craft Mason. Q. What are they? A. The Plumb, Square, and Level. Q. What do they teach? [I think this question ought to be, \"How explained?\"] A. The Plumb is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to raise perpendiculars; the Square, to square the work, and the Level, to lay horizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes. The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly, in our several stations, before God and man; squa ring our actions by the square of virtue; and remembering that we are all traveling upon the le vel of time, to that undiscovered country, from whose bourne no traveler returns. Q. What was you next presented with? A. Three precious jewels. Q. What were they? A. Faith, Hope, and Charity. Q. What do they teach? A. Fa ith in God, hope in immortalit y, and charity to all mankind. Q. How was you then disposed of? A. I was conducte d out of the Lodge, and invested of what I had been divested. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"SECOND SECTION. Question—Have you ever worked as a Fellow Craft Mason? Answer—I have, in speculative; but our forefathers wrought both in sp eculative and operative Masonry. [Pg 35] Q. Where did they work? A. At the building of King Solo mon's Temple, and many other Masonic edifices. Q. How long did they work? A. Six days. Q. Did they not work on the Seventh? A. They did not. Q. Why so? A. Because in six days God created the heavens and the earth, and rested on the seventh day; the seventh day, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labors; thereby enjoying more fre quent opportunities to c ontemplate the glorious works of creation, and adore their great Creator. Q. Did you ever return to the sanctum sanctorum, or holy of holies, of King Solomon's Temple? A. I did. Q. By what way? A. Through a long porch, or alley. Q. Did anything particular strike your attention on your return? A. There did; viz.: Two large columns, or pillars, one on the le ft hand, and the other on the right. Q. What was the name of the one on the left hand? A. B OAZ , to denote strength. Q. What was the name of the one on the right hand? A. J ACHIN , denoting establishment. Q. What do they collectively all ude to? A. A passage in Scripture, wherein God has declared in his word, \"In strength shall this house be established.\" Q. What were their dimensions? A. Eighteen cubits in height, twel ve in circumference, and four in diameter. Q. Were they adorned with anything? A. They were; with two large chapiters, one on each. Q. Were they ornamented with anything? A. They were; with wreaths of net work, lily work, and pomegranates. Q. What do they denote? A. Unity, Peace, and Plenty. Q. Why so? A. Net work, from its connection, denotes union; lily work, from its whiteness and purity, denotes peace; and pomegranates, from the exuberance of its seed, denotes plenty. Q. Were those columns adorned with anything furt her? A. They were; viz.: Two large globes, or balls, one on each. Q. Did they contain anything? A. They did; viz.; All the maps and charts of the celestial and terrestrial bodies. Q. Why are they said to be so extensive? A. To denote the universality of Masonry, and that a Mason's charity ought to be equally extensive. Q. What was their composition? A. Molten, or cast brass. Q. Who cast them? A. Our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff. Q. Where were they cast? A. On the banks of the river Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zaradatha, where King Solomon ordere d these and all other hol y vessels to be cast. Q. Were they cast solid or hollow? A. Hollow."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Q. What was their thickness? A. Four inches, or a hand's breadth. Q. Why were they cast hollow? A. The better to withstand inunda tions or conflagrations; were the archives of Masonry, and contained the constitution, roll s, and records. [Pg 36] Q. What did you next come to? A. A long, winding staircase, with three, five, seven steps, or more. Q. What does the three steps allude to? A. Th e three principal supports in Masonry, viz., Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty. Q. What does the five steps allude to? A. The fi ve orders in architecture, and the five human senses. Q. What are the five orders in architecture? A. The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. Q. What are the five human senses? A. Heari ng, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting; the first three of which have ever been deemed highly es sential among Masons: Hearing, to hear the word; Seeing, to see the sign; and Feeli ng, to feel the gri p, whereby one Mason may know another in the dark as well as in the light. Q. What does the seven steps allude to? A. The seven sabbatical years; seven years of famine; seven years In building the temple ; seven golden candlesticks; seve n wonders of the world; seven planets; but more especially the seven liberal arts and sciences, which are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astr onomy; for these, and many other reasons, the number seven has ever been held in high estimation among Masons. Q. What did you next come to? A. The outer door of the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple, which I found partly open, but closely tyled by the Junior Warden. Q. How did you gain admission? A. By a pass, and token of a pass. Q. What was the name of the pass? A. S HIBBOLETH . Q. What does it denote? A. Plenty. Q. Why so? A. From an ear of co rn being placed at the water-ford. Q. Why was this pass instituted? A. In conse quence of a quarrel which had long existed between Jephthah, Judge of Israel, and the Ephraimites, the latter of whom ha d long been a stubborn, rebellious people, whom Jephthah had endeavored to subdue by lenient measures, but to no effect. The Ephraimites being highly incensed against Jepht hah, for not being called to fight and share in the rich spoils of the Ammonitish war, assemble d a mighty army, and passed over the river Jordan to give Jephthah battle; but he, being apprised of their approach, called together the men of Israel, and gave them battle, and put them to flight; and to make his victory more complete, he ordered guards to be placed at the different passes on the banks of the river Jordan, and commanded, if the Ephraimites passed that way, that they should pronounce the word S HIBBOLETH ; but they, being of a different tribe, pronounced it S IBBOLETH , which trifling defect proved them spies, and cost them their lives; and there fell that da y, at the different passes on the ba nks of the river Jordan, forty and two thousand. This word was also used by our ancien t brethren to distinguish a friend from a foe, and has since been adopted as a proper pass-wor d, to be given before en tering any well-regulated and governed Lodge of Fellow Craft Masons. Q. What did you next discover? A. The inner door of the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple, which I found partly open, but closely tyled by the Senior Warden. [Pg 37] Q. How did you gain admission? A. By the grip and word."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Q. How did the Senior Warden dispose of you? A. He ordered me to be conducted to the Worshipful Master in the East, who informed me that I had been admitted into the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple for the sake of the letter G. Q.

It also denotes Geometry, the fifth science; it being that on which this degree was principally founded. Thus ends the second degree of Masonry.  "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE THIRD, OR MASTER MASON'S DEGREE. The traditional account of the death, several burials, and resu rrection of Hiram Abiff, the widow's son (as hereafter narrated), admitted as facts, this degree is certainly very interesting. The Bible informs us that there was a person of that name employed at the building of King Solomon's Temple; but neither the Bible, th e writings of Josephus, nor any ot her writings, however ancient, of which I have any knowledge, furnish any information respecting his death. It is very singular that a man so celebrated as Hiram Abiff was, and arb iter between Solomon, King of Israel, and Hiram, King of Tyre, universally acknowledged as the thir d most distinguished man then living, and in many respects, the greatest man in the world, shoul d pass off the stage of action, in the presence of King Solomon, three thousand, three hundred grand overseers, and one hundred and fifty thousand workmen, with whom he had spent a number of years, and neither King Solomon, his bosom friend, nor any other among his numerous friends, even recorded his death, or anything about him. A person who has received the two preceding degrees , and wishes to be raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason, is (t he Lodge being opened as in th e preceding degrees) conducted from the preparation room to the door (the manner of preparing him is particularly explained in the Lecture), where he gives three distinct knocks, when the Se nior Warden rises and says, \"Worshipful, while we are peaceably at work on the third degree of Masonry, under the influence of humanity, brotherly love, and affection, the door of our Lodge appears to be alarmed.\" The Master to the Junior Deacon, \"Broth er Junior, inquire the cause of that alarm.\" The Junior Deacon then steps to the door and answer s the three knocks that have been given by three more (the knocks are much louder than those given on any occasion, ot her than that of the admission of candidates in the several degrees); one knock is then given wit hout, and answered by one from within, when the door is partly opened, and the Junior Deacon asks, \"Who comes there? Who comes there? Who comes there?\" The Senior Deacon answers, \"A wort hy brother, who has been regularly initiated as an Entered Apprentice Mason, passed to the degree of a Fellow Craft, and now wishes for further light in Masonry, by being raised to the sublime degree of a Mast er Mason.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"Is it of his own free will and [Pg 38] accord he makes this request ?\" A. \"It is.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"Is he worthy and well quali fied?\" A. \"He is.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"Has he made suitable proficiency in the preceding degree?\" A. \"He has.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, \"By what further rights does he exp ect to obtain this benefit?\" A. \"By the benefit of a pass-word.\" Junior Deacon to Senior Deac on, \"Has he a pass-word?\" A. \"He has not, but I have it for him.\" Junior Deacon to Senior D eacon, \"Will you give it to me?\" The Senior Deacon then whispers in the ear of the Junior Deacon, \" T UBAL C AIN .\" Junior Deacon says, \"The pass is right; since this is the case, you will wait till the Worshipful Master be made acquainted with his request, and his answer returned.\" The Junior Deacon then repairs to the Master, and gives three knocks, as at the door; after answering which, the same questions are asked and answers returned, as at the door; when the Master says, \"Since he comes endued with all these necessary qualifications, let him enter this Worshipful Lodge in the name of the Lord, and take heed on what he enters.\" The Junior Deacon returns to the door a nd says, \"Let him enter this Worshipful Lodge in the name of the Lord, and take h eed on what he enters.\" In ente ring, both points of the Compass are pressed against his naked right and left breasts, when the Junior Deacon stops the candidate and says, \"Brother, when you first entered this Lodg e, you was received on the point of the Compass pressing your naked left breast, which was then explained to you; when you entered it the second time, you were received on the angle of the Square, which was also explained to you; on entering it now, you are received on the two extreme points of the Compass pressing your naked right and left breasts, which are thus explained: As the most vital points of ma n are contained between the two breasts, so are the most valuable tenets of Ma sonry contained between th e two extreme points of the Compass, which are 'Virtue, Morality, and Br otherly Love.'\" The Senior Deacon then conducts the candidate three times regularly around the Lodge. [I wish the reader to observe, that on this, as"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"well as every other degree, the Junior Warden is the first of the three principal officers that the candidate passes, traveling with the Sun, when he starts around the Lodge, and as he passes the Junior Warden, Senior Warden, and Master, the fi rst time going around, they each give one rap; the second time, two raps; and the third time, three ra ps. The number of raps given on those occasions are the same as the number of the degree, except the first degree, on which three are given, I always thought improperly.] During the time the candidate is traveling around the r oom, the Master reads the following passage of Scripture, the conductor a nd candidate traveling, and the Master reading, so that the traveling and readi ng terminates at the same time: \"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them: while the Sun, or the Moon, or the Stars be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain; in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the streets; [Pg 39] when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low. Also, when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail, because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about th e streets. Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth, as it was; and the spirit return unto God who gave it.\" The conductor and candidate halt at the Junior Warden in the South, where the same questions are asked and answers returned, as at the door; he is then conducted to the Senior Warden, where the same questions are asked and answers returned as before; from thence he is conducted to the Worshipful Master in the East, who asks the sa me questions and receives the same answers as before; and who likewise asks the candidate from whence he came, and whither he is traveling? A NS . \"From the West, and traveling to the East.\" Q. \"Why do you leave the West and travel to the East?\" A. \"In search of more lig ht.\" The Master then says to th e Senior Deacon, \"You will please conduct the candidate back to the West, from wh ence he came, and put him in the care of the Senior Warden, and request him to teach the ca ndidate how to approach the East, by advancing upon three upright regular steps to the third step, his feet forming a square, his body erect at the altar before the Worshipful Master, and place him in a proper position to take upon him the solemn oath or obligation of a Master Ma son.\" The Master then comes to the candidate and says, \"Brother, you are now placed in a proper position (the Lectur e explains it) to take upon you the solemn oath or obligation of a Master Mason, wh ich I assure you, as before, is neit her to affect your religion nor politics. If you are willin g to take it, repeat your name, and say after me: \"I, A.

Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not be at the initiating, passing, or raising a candidate in a clandestine Lodge, I knowing it to [Pg 40] be such. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not be at the initiating of an old man in dotage, a young man in nonage, an atheist, irreligious libertine, idiot, madman, hermaphrodite, nor woman.

Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will be aiding and assisting all poor indigent Master Masons, their wives and orphans, wheresoever disposed 'round the globe, as far as in my power, without injuring myself or family materially.

To all which I do most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with a fixed and steady purpose of mind in me, to keep and perform the same, binding myself under no less penalty than to have my body severed in two in the midst, and divided to the North and South, my bowels burnt to ashes in the centre, and the ashes scattered before the four winds of heaven, that there might not the least tract or trace of remembrance remain among men or Masons of so vile and perjured a wretch as I should be, were I ever to prove wilfully guilty of violating any part of this my solemn oath or obligation of a Master Mason; so help me God, and keep me steadfast in the due performance of the same.\" The Master then asks the candidate, \"What do you most desire?\" The candidate answers after his prompter, \"More light.\" The bandage which was tied 'round his head in the preparation room is, by one of the brethren who stands behind him for th at purpose, loosened and put over both eyes, and he is immediately brought to light in the same manner as in the prece ding degree, except three stamps on the floor, and three claps of the hands are given in this de gree. On being brought to light, the Master says to the candidate, \"You first discove r, as before, three great lights in Masonry, by the assistance of three lesser, with this differe nce, both points of the Compass are elevated above the Square, which denotes to you that you are about to receive all the light that can be conferred on you in a Mason's Lodge.\" The Master steps back from the candidate and says, \"Brother, you now discover me as Master of [Pg 41] this Lodge, approaching you from the East, under the sign and due- guard of a Master Mason.\" The sign is given by raising both ha nds and arms to the elbows perpendicularly, one on either side of the head, the elbows forming a square. The words accompanying this sign in case of distress are, \"O Lord, my God, is there no help for the widow's son?\" As the last words drop from your lips, you let your hands fall in that manner best calculated"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"to indicate solemnity. King Solomon is said to ha ve made this exclamation on the receipt of the information of the death of Hiram Abiff. Masons ar e all charged never to gi ve the words except in the dark, when the sign cannot be seen. Here Mas ons differ very much; some contend that Solomon gave this sign, and made this exclamation when informed of Hiram's death, and work accordingly in their Lodges. Others say the sign was given, and the exclamation made at the grave when Solomon went there to raise Hiram, and, of course, they work accordingly; that is to say, the Master who governs a Lodge holding the la tter opinion, gives the sign, &c., at the grave, when he goes to raise the body, and vice versa. The due-guard is give n by putting the right hand to the left side of the bowels, the hand open, with the thumb next to the belly, and drawing it across the belly and let it fall; this is done tolerably quick. After the Ma ster has given the sign a nd due-guard, which does not take more than a minute, he says, \"Brother, I now present you with my right hand in token of brotherly love and affection, and with it the pass-gr ip and word.\" The pass-grip is given by pressing the thumb between the joints of the second and third fingers, where they join the hand, and the word or name is T UBAL C AIN . It is the pass-word to the Master 's degree. The Master, after having given the candidate the pass-grip an d word, bids him rise and salute the Junior and Senior Wardens, and convince them that he is an obligated Master Mason, and is in possessi on of the pass-grip and word. While the Wardens are examining the candidate , the Master returns to the East and gets an apron, and as he returns to the candidate, one of the Wardens (sometimes both) says to the Master, \"Worshipful, we are satisfied that Brother —— is an obligated Master Ma son.\" The Master then says to the candidate, \"Brother, I now have th e honor to present you with a lamb-skin, or white apron, as before, which, I hope, you will continue to wear with credit to yourself, and satisfaction and advantage to the brethren; you will please carry it to the Senior Warden in the West, who will teach you how to wear it as a Master Mason.\" The Senior Warden ties on his apron, and lets the flap fall down before in its natural and common situation. The Master returns to his seat, and the candidate is conducted to him. Master to candidate, \"Brother, I perceive you ar e dressed; it is, of course, necessary you should have tools to work with; I will now present you with the wo rking tools of a Master Mason, and explain their uses to you. The working tools of a Master Ma son are all the implements of Ma sonry indiscriminately, but more especially the Trowel. The Trowel is an instrume nt made use of by operative Masons to spread the cement which unites a building into one common ma ss; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble [Pg 42] and glorious purpose of spreading the cement of brotherly love and affecti on; that cement which unites us into one sacred band or society of friends and brothers, among whom no conten tion should ever exist, but that noble contention, or rather emulation, of who can best work, or best agree. I also present you with three precious jewels; their names are Humanity, Friendship, and Brotherly Love. Brother, you are not yet invested with all the secrets of this degree, nor do I know whether you ever will, until I know how you withstand the amazing trials and dangers that aw ait you. You are now abou t to travel to give us a specimen of your fortitude, perseverance, and fidelity, in th e preservation of what you have already received; fare you well, and may the Lord be with you, and support you through your trials and difficulties.\" [In some Lodges they make him pray before he starts.] The candida te is then conduc ted out of the Lodge, clothed, and returns; as he enters the door, his conductor says to him, \"Brother, we are now in a place representing the SANCTUM SANCTORUM , or HOLY OF HOLIES , of King Solomon's Temple. It was the custom of our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, every day at high twelve, when the crafts were from labor to refreshment, to enter into the sanctum sanctorum and offer up his devotions to the ever li ving God. Let us, in imitation of him, kn eel and pray.\" They then kneel, and the conductor says the following prayer: \"Thou, O God, knowest our downsitting and uprising, and understandest our thoughts afar off; shield and defend us from the evil intentions of our enemies, and support us under the trials and afflictions we"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"are destined to endure while traveling through this vale of tears.

For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down and riseth not up till the heavens shall be no more. Yet, O Lord! have compassion on the children of Thy creation; administer unto them comfort in time of trouble, a nd save them with an everlasting salvation. Amen. So mote it be.\" They then rise, and the conductor says to the ca ndidate, \"Brother, in further imitation of our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, let us retire at the South gate.\" Th ey then advance to the Junior Warden (who represents J UBELA , one of the ruffians), who exclaims, \"Who comes here?\" [The room is dark, or the candidate hoodwinked.] The conduc tor answers, \"Our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff.\" \"Our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff!\" exclaims the ruffian, \"he is the very man I wanted to see (seizing the candidate by the throat at the same tim e, and jerking him about with violence); give me the Master Mason's word, or I'll ta ke your life.\" The conductor replies, \"I cannot give it now, but if you will wait till the Grand Lodge assembles at Je rusalem, if you are worthy, you shall then receive it, otherwise you cannot.\" The ruffian then gives the candidate a blow with the twenty-four-inch gauge across the throat, on which he fled to the West gate, where he was accosted by the second ruffian, [Pg 43] J UBELO , with more violence, and on his refusing to comply with his request, he gave him a severe blow with the Square across his breast; on which he attempted to make his escape at the East gate, where he was accosted by the third ruffian, J UBELUM , with still more violence, and refusing to comply with his request, the ruffian ga ve him a violent blow w ith the common gavel on the forehead, which brought him to the floor, on which one of them exclaimed, \"What shall we do, we have killed our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff?\" Another answers, \"Let us carry him out at the East gate and bury him in the rubbish till low twelve, and then meet and carry him a westerly course and bury him.\" The candidate is then taken up in a bla nket, on which he fell, and carried to the West end of the Lodge, and covered up and left; by th is time the Master has resumed his seat (King Solomon is supposed to arrive at the Temple at th is juncture), and calls to order, and asks the Senior Warden the cause of all that confusion; the Senior Warden answers, \"Our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, is missing, and ther e are no plans or desi gns laid down on the Tressle-Board for the crafts to pursue their labor.\" Th e Master, alias King Solomon, repl ies, \"Our Grand Master missing; our Grand Master has always been very punctual in his attendanc e; I fear he is indisposed; assemble the crafts, and search in and about th e Temple, and see if he can be found.\" They all shuffle about the floor a while, when the Master cal ls them to order, and asks the Senior Warden, \"What success?\" He answers, \"We cannot find our Grand Master, my Lord.\" The Master then orders the Secretary to call th e roll of workmen, and see whet her any of them are missing. The Secretary calls the roll, and says , \"I have called the roll, my Lord, and find that there are three missing, viz.: J UBELA , J UBELO and J UBELUM .\" His Lordship then observes, \"This brings to my mind a circumstance that took place this morning—twe lve Fellow Crafts, clothed in white gloves and aprons, in token of their innocence, came to me and confessed th at they twelve, with three others, had conspired to extort the Master Mason's word from their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, and in case of refusal to take his life; they twelve had recant ed, but feared the other th ree had been base enough to carry their atrocious designs into execution.\" So lomon then ordered twelve Fellow Crafts to be drawn from the bands of the workmen, clothed in white aprons, in token of their Innocence, and sent three East, three West, three North, and three South, in search of the ruffians, and, if found, to bring them forward. Here the members all shuffle a bout the floor awhile, and fall in with a reputed traveler, and inquire of him if he had seen any traveling men that way; he tells them that he had"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"seen three that morning near the coast of Joppa , who from their dress a nd appearance were Jews, and were workmen from the Temple, inquiring for a passage to Ethiopia, but were unable to obtain one, in consequence of an embargo which had recentl y been laid on all the shipping, and had turned back into the country. The Master now calls them to order again, and asks the Senior Warden, \"What success?\" He answers by relating what had taken place. Solomon observes, \"I had this embargo laid to prevent the ruffians from making their escape;\" and adds, \"you will go and search [Pg 44] again, and search till you find them, if possible; and if they are not found, the twelve who confessed shall be considered as the reputed murderers, and suffer accordingly.\" The members all start again, and shuffle about aw hile, until one of them, as if by accident, finds the body of Hiram Abiff, alias the candidate and hails his travelin g companions, who join him, and while they are humming out something over the candidate, the three reputed ruffians, who are seated in a private corner near the candidate, are heard to exclaim in the following manner—first, J UBELA , \"O that my throat had been cut across, my t ongue torn out, and my body buried in the rough sands of the sea at low-water mark, where the tide ebbs and flows twi ce in twenty-four hours, er e I had been accessory to the death of so good a man as our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff.\" The second, J UBELO , \"O that my left breast had been torn open, and my heart and vitals taken from thence, and thrown over my le ft shoulder, carried into the va lley of Jehosaphat, and there to become a prey to the wild beasts of the field, and vultures of the air, ere I had conspired the death of so good a man as our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff.\" The third, J UBELUM , \"O that my body had been severed in two in the midst, and divided to the North and South, my bowels burnt to ashes in the centre, and the as hes scattered by the four winds of heaven, that there might not the least track or trace of remembra nce remain among men or Masons of so vile and perjured a wretch as I am. Ah, J UBELA and J UBELO , it was I that struck him harder than you both—it was I that gave him the fatal blow—it was I that killed him outright.\" The three Fellow Crafts who had stood by the candidate all this ti me listening to the ruffians, whose voices they recognized, says one to the ot her, \"What shall we do, there are three of them, and only three of us?\" \"It is,\" said one in repl y, \"our cause is good, let us seize them;\" on which they rush forward, and carry them to the Master, to whom they relate what had passed. The Master then addresses them in the following manner (they in many Lodges kneel, or lie down, in token of their guilt and peni tence): \"Well, J UBELA , what have you got to say for yourself—guilty or not guilty?\" A. \"Guilty, my Lord.\" \" J UBELO , guilty or not guilty?\" A. \"Guilty, my Lord.\" \" J UBELUM , guilty or not guilty?\" A. \"Guilty, my Lord.\" The Ma ster to the three Fellow Crafts who took them, \"Take them without the West gate of the Temple , and have them executed according to the several imprecations of their own mouths.\" They are then hu rried off to the West end of the room. Here this part of the farce ends. The Master then orders fift een Fellow Crafts to be elected from the bands of the workmen, and sent three East, three West, thr ee North, three South; and three in and about the Temple, in search of their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff [In some Lodges they only send twelve, when their own Lectures say fifteen were sent], and charges them if they find the body, to examine carefully on and about it for the Master's word, or a key to it. The three that traveled a Westerly course come to the candidate an d finger about him a little, and are called to order by the Master, when they report that they have [Pg 45] found the grave of their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, and, on moving the earth till they came to the body, they involuntarily found their hands raised in this position [showing it at the same ti me; it is the due-guard of this degree], to guard their nostrils against the offensive affluvia which arose from the grave; and that they had searched carefully on and about the body for the Master's word, but had not discovered an ything but a faint resemblance of the letter G on the left breast. The Master, on the receipt of this information (raising himself), raises his hand three several times above his head (a s herein before described), and exclaims twice, \"Nothing but a faint resemblance of the letter G! that is not the Master's word, nor a key to it, I fear the Master's word is forever lost!\" [The third exclamation is different from the others—attend to it;"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"it has been described in pages 40 and 41.] \"Nothing but a faint resemb lance of the lette r G! that is not the Master's word, nor a key to it.\" \"O Lord, my God, is there no help for the widow's son?\" The Master then orders the Junior Warden to summon a Lodge of Entered Apprentice Masons, and repair to the grave to raise the body of their Gr and Master, by the Entered Apprentice's grip. They go to the candidate and take hold of his forefinger and pull it, and re turn and tell the Master that they could not raise him by the Entered Apprentice' s grip; that th e skin cleaved from the bone. A Lodge of Fellow Crafts are then se nt, who act as before, except that they pull the candidate's second finger. The Master then direct s the Senior Warden [generally ] to summon a Lodge of Master Masons, and says, \"I will go with them myself in person, and try to raise the body by the Master's grip, or lion's paw.\" [Some say by the strong grip, or the lion's paw.] They then all assemble around the candidate, the Master having declared the firs t word spoken after the body was raised, should be adopted as a substitute for the Master's word, for the government of Master Mason's Lodges in all future generations; he proceeds to raise the candi date, alias the representative of the dead body of Hiram Abiff. He [the candidate] is raised on what is called the five point s of fellowship, which are foot to foot, knee to knee, breast to breast, hand to back, and mouth to ear. This is done by putting the inside of your right foot to the inside of the right foot of the person to whom you are going to give the word, the inside of your knee to his, layi ng your right breast against his, your left hands on the back of each other, and your mouths to each other's right ear [in which position you are alone permitted to give the word], and whisper the word M AH - HAH - BONE . The Master's grip is given by taking hold of each other's right hand, as though you were going to shake hands, and sticking the nails of each of your fingers into the joint of the other's wrist, where it unites with the hand. In this position the candidate is raised, he keeping his whole body stiff, as though dead. The Master, in raising him, is assisted by some of the brethren , who take hold of the ca ndidate by the arms and shoulders. As soon as he is raised to his feet they step back, a nd the Master whis pers the word M AH - HAH - BONE in his ear, and causes the candidate to repeat it, telling him at the same time that he must never give it in any manner other than that in which he receives it. He is also told that M AH - HAH - BONE [Pg 46] signifies marrow in the bone. They then separate, and the Master makes the following explanation respecting the five points of fellowship. Master to candidate, \"Brother, foot to foot teaches you that you shoul d, whenever asked, go on a brother' s errand, if with in the length of your cable-tow, even if you should have to go ba refoot and bareheaded. Knee to knee, that you should always remember a Master Mason in your devotion to Almi ghty God. Breast to breast, that you should keep the Master Mason's secrets, when given to you in charge as such, as secure and inviolable in your breast, as they were in his own, before communicated to you. Hand to back, that you should support a Master Mason behind his back, as well as before his face. Mouth to ear, that you should support his good name as well be hind his back as before his face.\" After the candidate is th rough with what is called the work pa rt, the Master addresses him in the following manner: \"Brother, you may suppose from the manner you have been dealt with to-night, that we have been fooling with you, or that we have treated you different from others, but I assure you that is not the case. You have, this night, repres ented one of the greatest men that ever lived, in the tragical catastrophe of his deat h, burial, and resurrec tion; I mean Hiram Abiff, the widow's son, who was slain by three ruffians at the building of King Solomon's Temple, and who, in his inflexibility, integrity, and for titude, never was surpassed by man. The history of that momentous event is thus related. Masonic tradition informs us that at the building of King Solomon's Temple, fifteen Fellow Crafts discovering that the Temple was almost finished, and not having the Master Mason's word, became very impatient, and entered into a horrid conspiracy to extort the Master Mason's word from their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, the first time they met him alone, or take his life, that they might pass as Mast ers in other countries, and receive wages as such; but before they could accomplish their designs, twelve of them r ecanted, but the other three were base enough to carry their atrocious designs in to execution. Their names were J UBELA , J UBELO , and J UBELUM ."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"\"It was the custom of our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, every day at high twelve, when the crafts were from labor to refreshment, to enter into th e sanctum sanctorum, and of fer his devotions to the ever living God, and draw out his plans and designs on the Tressle- Board for the crafts to pursue their labor. On a certain day (not name d in any of our traditional accounts), J UBELA , J UBELO and J UBELUM placed themselves at the South, West, and East gates of the Temple, and Hiram having finished his devotions and labor, attempted (as was his usual custom ) to retire at the South gate, where he was met by J UBELA , who demanded of him the Master Mason's word (some say the secrets of a Master Mason), a nd on his refusal to give it, J UBELA gave him a violent blow with a twenty-four-inch gauge across the throat; on which Hiram fled to the West gate, where he was accosted in the same manner by J UBELO , but with more violence. Hira m told him that he could not give the word then, because Solomon, King of Isr ael, Hiram, King of Tyre, and himself had entered into a solemn league that th e word never should be given, [Pg 47] unless they three were present; but if he would have patience till th e Grand Lodge assembled at Jerusalem, if he was then found worthy he should then receive it, otherwise he could not; J UBELO replied in a very peremptory manner, \"If you do not give me the Master's wor d, I'll take your life;\" and on Hiram's refusing to give it, J UBELO gave him a severe blow with the Square across the left breast, on which he fled to the East gate, where he was accosted by J UBELUM , in the same manner, but with still more violence. Here Hiram reasoned as before; J UBELUM told him that he had heard his caviling with J UBELA and J UBELO long enough, and that the Master's word had b een promised to him from time to time for a long time; that he was still put off, and that the Temple was almost finished, and he was determined to have the word or take his life. \"I want it so that I may be able to get wages as a Master Mason in any country to which I may go for employ, after the Te mple is finished, and that I may be able to support my wife and children.\" Hiram persisting in hi s refusal, he gave Hiram a violent blow with the gavel on the forehead, which felled him to th e floor and killed him; they took the body and carried it out of the West gate, and buried it in th e rubbish till low twelve at night (which is twelve o'clock), when they three met agreeably to appo intment, and carried th e body a westerly course, and buried it at the brow of a hill, in a grave, dug due East and West, six feet perpendicular, and made their escape. King Solomon coming up to the Temple at low six in the morning (as was his usual custom), found the crafts all in confusion, a nd on inquiring the cause, wa s informed that their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, was missing, and th ere was no plans or designs laid down on the Tressle-Board, for the crafts to pursue their labor. Solomon ordered search to be made inland about the Temple for him; no discovery being made, he then ordered the Secretary to call the roll of workmen to see if any were missing; it appearing that there were three, viz.: J UBELA , J UBELO and J UBELUM , Solomon observed, \"This brings to my mind a circumstance that took place this morning. Twelve Fellow Crafts came to me, dressed in white gloves and aprons, in token of their innocence, and confessed that they twelve, w ith three others, had conspired to extort the Master Mason's word from their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, and in case of his refusal to take his life; they twelve had recanted, but feared the three others had been ba se enough to carry their atrocious designs into execution.\" Solomon immediately ordered twelve Fello w Crafts to be selected from the bands of the workmen, clothed in white gloves and aprons, in token of their innocence, and sent three East, three West, three North, and three South, in search of the ruffians, and, if found, to bring them up before him. The three that traveled a westerly cour se, coming near the coast of Joppa, fell in with a wayfaring man, who informed them that he had seen three men pass that way that morning, who, from their appearance and dress, were workmen from the Temple, inquiring for a passage to Ethiopia, but were unable to obtain one, in conse quence of an embargo which had recently been laid on all the shipping, and ha d turned back into the country. After making further and more diligent search, and making no further discovery, they returned to the Temple and reported [Pg 48] to Solomon the result of their pursuit and inquiries.

How were you prepared? A. By being divested of all metals; neithe r naked nor clothed; barefooted nor shod; with a cab le-tow three times about my na ked body; in which posture I was conducted to the door of the Lodge, wh ere I gave three distinct knocks. [Pg 50] Q. What did those three distin ct knocks allude to? A. To th e third degree in Masonry; it being that on which I was about to enter. Q. What was said to you from within? A. Who comes there? Who comes there? Who comes there? Q. Your answer? A. A worthy brother, who has been regularly initiated as an Entered Apprentice Mason, passed to the degree of a Fellow Craft, a nd now wishes for further light in Masonry, by being raised to the sublim e degree of a Master Mason. Q. What further was said to you from within? A. I was asked if it was of my own free will and accord I made this request; if I was duly and tr uly prepared; worthy and well qualified; and had made suitable proficiency in the preceding degree; a ll of which being answered in the affirmative, I was asked by what further rights I expected to obtain that benefit. Q. Your answer? A. By the benefit of a pass-word. Q. What was that pass-word? A. T UBAL C AIN . Q. What was next said to you? A. I was bid to wait till the Worshipful Master in the East was made acquainted with my reque st, and his answ er returned. Q. After his answer was returned, what followed? A. I was caused to enter the Lodge on the two extreme points of the Compass pressing my right and left breasts, in the name of the Lord. Q. How were you then disposed of? A. I was conducted three times regu larly around the Lodge and halted at the Junior Warden in the South, wh ere the same questions were asked and answers returned, as at the door. Q. How did the Junior Warden dispose of you? A. He ordered me to be conducted to the Senior Warden in the West, where the same questions were asked and answers returned as before. Q. How did the Senior Warden dispose of you? A. He ordered me to be conducted to the Worshipful Master in the East, where the same questions were asked, and answers returned as before; who likewise demanded of me from whence I came, and whither I was traveling. Q. Your answer? A. From the We st, and traveling to the East. Q. Why do you leave the West and travel to the East? A. In search of light. Q. How did the Worshipful Master dispose of you? A. He ordere d me to be conducted back to the West, from whence I came, and put in care of the Senior Warden, who taught me how to approach the East, by advancing upon three upright re gular steps to the third step, my feet forming a square, and my body erect at the al tar before the Worshipful Master.

Both my knees bare bent, they forming a square; both hands on the Holy Bible, Square, and Compass; in which posture I took upon me the solemn oath or obligation of a true Master Mason. [Pg 51] Q. After your obligation, what was said to you? A. What do you most desire. Q. Your answer? A. More light. [The bandage around the head is now dropped over the eyes.] Q. Did you receive light? A. I did. Q. On being brought to light on th is degree, what did you first disc over? A. Three great lights in Masonry, by the assistance of thr ee less, and both points of the Compass elevated above the Square, which denoted to me that I had received, or was about to receive, all the light that could be conferred on me in a Master's Lodge. Q. What did you next discover? A. The Worshipf ul Master approaching me from the East, under the sign and due-guard of a Master Mason, who presented me with his right hand in token of brotherly love and confidence, and proceeded to gi ve me the pass-grip and word of a Master Mason [the word is the name of the pass-grip], and bid me rise and salute the Juni or and Senior Wardens, and convince them that I was an obligated Mast er Mason, and had the sign, pass-grip, and word ( T UBAL C AIN ).

Q. What were you next presented with? A. The working tools of a Master Mason. Q. What are they? A. All the implements of Ma sonry indiscriminately, but more especially the Trowel. Q. How explained? A. The Trowel is an instrume nt made use of by operative Masons to spread the cement which unites a buildi ng into one common mass; but we , as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble a nd glorious purposes of spreading the cement of brotherly love and affection; that cement which unites us into one sacred band, or society of brothers, among whom no contention should ever ex ist, but that noble emulation of who can best work, or best agree. Q. What were you next presented with? A. Three precious jewels. Q. What are they? A. Humanit y, Friendship, and Brotherly Love. Q. How were you then disposed of? A.

Question—Did you ever return to the SANCTUM SANCTORUM , or HOLY OF HOLIES , of King Solomon's Temple? Answer—I did. Q. Was there anything in particular took place on your return? A. There was, viz., I was accosted by three ruffians, who demanded of me the Master Mason's word. Q. Did you ever give it to them? A. I did not, but bid them wait, with time and patience, till the Grand Lodge assembled at Jerusalem, and [Pg 52] then, if they were found worthy, they should receive it, otherwise they could not. Q. In what manner was you accosted? A. In attempti ng to retire at the Sout h gate, I was accosted by one of them, who demanded of me the Master Mason's word, and, on my refusing to comply with his request, he gave me a blow with the twenty-four-inch gauge across my breast, on which I fled to the West gate, where I was accosted by th e second with more violen ce, and, on my refusing to comply with his request, he gave me a severe blow with the Square across my breast; on which I attempted to make my escape at the East gate, wh ere I was accosted by the third with still more violence, and, on my refusing to comply with his request, he gave me a violent blow with the common gavel on the forehead, and brought me to the floor.

Q. What did they do with the body? A. They carried it out at the West gate of the Temple, and buried it till low twelve at night, when they three met agreeably to appointment, and carried it a westerly course from the Temple, and buried it under th e brow of a hill, in a grave six feet, due East and West, six feet perpendicu lar, and made their escape. Q. What time was he slain? A. At high twelve at noon, when the crafts were from labor to refreshment. Q. How came he to be alone at that time? A. Because it was the usual custom of our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, every day at high twelve, when the crafts were from labor to refreshment, to enter into the SANCTUM SANCTORUM , or HOLY OF HOLIES , and offer up his ador ations to the ever- living God, and draw out his plans and designs on hi s Tressle-Board, for the crafts to pursue their labor. Q. At what time was he missing? A. At low si x in the morning, when King Solomon came up to the Temple, as usual, to view the work, and found the crafts all in confus ion; and, on inquiring the cause, he was informed that their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, was missing, and no plans or designs were laid down on the Tressle-Board for the crafts to pursue their labor. Q. What observations did King Solomon make at that time? A. He observed that our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, ha d always been very punctual in a ttending, and feared that he was indisposed, and ordered search to be made in and about the Temple, to see if he could be found. Q. Search being made, and he not found, what further remarks did King Solomon make? A. He observed he feared some fatal accident had befalle n our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff; that morning twelve Fellow Crafts, clothed in white gloves and aprons, in token of their innocence, had confessed that they twelve with three others, had conspired to exto rt the Master Mason's word from"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, [Pg 53] or take his life; that they twelve had recanted, but feared the other three had been base enough to carry their atrocious designs into execution.

By the wisdom of King Solomon, who ordered fifteen (in some Lodges they say twelve) Fellow Crafts to be selected from the bands of the workmen, and sent three East, three West, three North, and three Sout h; and three in and about the Temple, in search of the body. Q. Where was it found? A. Under that sprig of cassia, where a worthy brother sat down to rest and refresh himself. Q. Was there anything particular took place on the discovery of the body? A. There was, viz.: On removing the earth till they came to the coffin, they involuntarily found their hands raised in this position to guard their nostrils against the offensive effluvia that 'rose from the grave. Q. How long had the body lain there? A. Fourteen days. Q. What did they do with the body? A. Raised it in a Masonic form, and carried it up to the Temple for more decent interment. Q. Where was it buried? A. Under the SANCTUM SANCTORUM , or HOLY OF HOLIES , of King Solomon's Temple, over which they erected a marble monument, with this inscription delineated thereon: A virgin weeping over a broken column, w ith a book open before her; in her ri ght hand a sprig of cassia; in her left, an urn; Time standing behind her, with his hands infolded in the ringlets of her hair. Q. What do they denote? A. The weeping virgin denotes the unfinished st ate of the Temple; the broken column, that one of the principal supporters of Mas onry had fallen; the open book before her, that his memory was on perpetual record; the sp rig of cassia, the timely discovery of his grave; the urn in her left hand, that his ashes were safely deposited under the SANCTUM SANCTORUM , or HOLY OF HOLIES , of King Solomon's Temple; and Time standing behind her, with his hands infolded in the ringlets of her hair, that time, patience, and perseverance will accomplish all things.  "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THIRD SECTION. Question—What does a Master's Lodge represent? Answer—The SANCTUM SANCTORUM , or HOLY OF HOLIES , of King Solomon's Temple. Q. How long was the Temple building? A. Seve n years; during which it rained not in the daytime, that the workmen might not be obstructed in their labor. [Pg 55] Q. What supported the Temple? A. Fourteen hundred and fifty-three columns, and two thousand, nine hundred and six pilasters, a ll hewn from the finest Parian marble. Q. What further supported it? A. Th ree grand columns, or pillars. Q. What were they called? A. Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty. Q. What did they represent? A. The pillar of Wisdom repres ented Solomon, King of Israel, whose wisdom contrived the mighty fabric; the pillar of Strength, Hiram, King of Tyre, who strengthened Solomon in his glor ious undertaking; the pillar of Beauty, Hiram Abiff, the widow's son, whose cunning craft and curious workmanship beautified and adorned the Temple. Q. How many were there employed in the buildi ng of King Solomon's Temple? A. Three Grand Masters; three thousand, three hundred Masters, or overseers of the work; eighty thousand Fellow Crafts, and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices; all those were classed and arranged in such a manner, by the wisdom of Solomo n, that neither envy, discord, nor confusion were suffered to interrupt that universal peace and tranquility that pervaded the work at that important period. Q. How many constitutes an Ente red Apprentice's Lodge? A. Seve n; one Master and six Entered Apprentices. Q. Where did they usually meet? A. On the ground floor of King Solomon's Temple. Q. How many constitutes a Fellow Craft's Lodge? A. Five; two Masters and three Fellow Crafts. Q. Where did they usually meet? A. In th e middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple. Q. How many constitutes a Master's Lodge? A. Three Master Masons. Q. Where did they usually meet? A. In the SANCTUM SANCTORUM , or HOLY OF HOLIES , of King Solomon's Temple. Q. Have you any emblems on this degree? A. We have several, which are divided into two classes. Q. What are the first class? A. The pot of incense; the bee-hive; the book of constitutions, guarded by the Tyler's sword; the sword, pointing to a naked heart; the all-seeing eye; the anchor and ark; the forty-seventh problem of Euclid; the hour-glass; the scythe; and the three steps usually delineated on the Master's carpet, wh ich are thus explained: The pot of INCENSE is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an accep table sacrifice to the Deity; and as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gra titude to the great and be neficent Author of our existence, for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. The BEE-HIVE is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practi ce of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industri ous ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us are in want, when it is in our power to relieve them, without inconvenience to ourselves. When we take a survey of nature, we behold man, in his infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishi ng for days, weeks, months, and [Pg 56] years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself; of guarding against the attacks of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Creator of heaven and earth to have made man i ndependent of all other beings, but as independence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enj oy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he, who will so demean himself as not to be end eavoring to add to the co mmon stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a DRONE in the HIVE of nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons. The BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS, GUARDED BY THE TYLER'S SWORD , reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guar ded, in our thoughts, words, and actions, and particularly when before the en emies of Masonry; ever bearing in remembrance those truly masonic virtues, SILENCE and CIRCUMSPECTION . The SWORD , POINTING TO A NAKED HEART , demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and, although our thoughts, words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of men, yet that ALL-SEEING EYE , whom the SUN , MOON , and STARS obey, and under whose watchful care ev en comets perform their stupendous revolutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the hu man heart, and will reward us according to our merits. The ANCHOR and ARK are emblems of a well-grounded hope and well-spent life. They are emblematical of that divine ARK which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that ANCHOR which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary shall find rest. The FORTY - SEVENTH PROBLEM OF E UCLID —this was an invention of our ancient friend a nd brother, the great Pythagoras, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated in to several orders of priesthood, an d raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry or Masonry; on this s ubject he drew out many problems and theorems; and among the most distinguished, he erected this, which, in the joy of his heart, he called E UREKA , in the Grecian language signifying, I HAVE FOUND IT ; and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It t eaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. The HOUR-GLASS is an emblem of human lif e. Behold! how swiftly the sa nds run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close. We cannot, without astonishment behol d the little particles which are contained in this machine; how th ey pass away almost imperceptibly, and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man to-day; he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; to-morrow, blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day come s a frost, which nips the shoot, and when he thinks his greatness is still ripeni ng, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. The SCYTHE is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launc hes us into eternity. Behold! what havoc the [Pg 57] scythe of time makes among the human race; if, by chance, we should escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and, with health and vigor, arrive to the years of manhood, ye t withal, we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers had gone before us. The THREE STEPS , usually delineated upon the Master's carpet, are emblematical of the three princi pal stages of human life, viz.: Youth, Manhood, and Age. In youth, as En tered Apprentices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in manhood, as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our resp ective duties to God, our neighbors, and ourselves; so that in age, as Master Masons, we may enjo y the happy reflections consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. Q. What are the second class of emblems? A. The spade, coffin, death-head, marrow bones, and sprig of cassia, which are thus explained: The SPADE opens the vault to receive our bodies, where our active limbs will soon moulder to dust. The COFFIN , DEATH-HEAD , and MARROW BONES are emblematical of the death and bur ial of our Grand Master, Hiram Ab iff, and are worthy our serious attention. The SPRIG OF CASSIA is emblematical of that immortal part of man which never dies; and"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"when the cold winter of death sh all have passed, and the bright su mmer's morn of the resurrection appears, the Son of Righteousness shall descend, and send forth his an gels to collect our ransomed dust; then, if we are found worthy, by his pass-word we shall enter into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presid es, where we shall see the King in the beauty of holiness, and with him enter into an endless fraternity. Here ends the first three degrees of Masonr y, which constitutes a Master Mason's Lodge. A Master Mason's Lodge and a Chap ter of Royal Arch Masons are two distinct bodies, wholly independent of each other. The members of a Chap ter are privileged to vi sit all Master Mason's Lodges when they please; and may be, and often are, members of both at the same time; and all the members of a Master Mason's Lodge who are Royal Arch Masons, though not members of any Chapter, may visit any Chapter. I wish the reader to understand that neither all Royal Arch Masons nor Master Masons are members of either Lodge or Chapter; ther e are tens of thousands who are not members, and scarcely ever at tend, although privileged to do so. A very small proportion of Masons, comparatively speaking, ever advance any further than the third degree, and consequently never get the grea t word which was lost by Hiram's untimely death. Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, the widow's son, having sworn that they, nor either of them, w ould ever give the word, except they three were present (and it is generally believed that there was not another person in the world, at that time, that had it), consequently the word was lost, an d supposed to be forever; but the sequel will show it was found, after a lapse of four hundred and se venty years; notwithstanding, the word M AH - HAH - BONE , which was substituted by Solomon, still continues to be used by Mast er Masons, and no doubt will, [Pg 58] as long as Masonry attracts the a ttention of men; and the word wh ich was lost is used in the Royal Arch Degree. What was the word of the R oyal Arch Degree before they found the Master's word, which was lost at the death of Hiram Abi ff, and was not found for four hundred and seventy years? Were there any Royal Arch Masons befo re the Master's word was found? I wish some masonic gentleman would solve these two questions. The ceremonies, histories, and the Lecture, in th e preceding degree are so similar that perhaps some one of the three might have been dispen sed with, and the subjec t well understood by most readers, notwithstanding there is a small differe nce between the work and history, and between the history and the Lecture. I shall now proceed with the Mark Master's degree, which is the first degr ee in the Chapter. The Mark Master's degree, the Past Master's, and th e Most Excellent Master's, are Lodges of Mark Master Masons, Past Master, a nd Most Excellent Master; yet, although called Lodges, they are called component parts of the Chapter. Ask a Mark Master Mason if he bel ongs to the Chapter; he will tell you he does, but that he has only been marked. It is not an uncommon thing, by any means, for a Chapter to confer all four of the degrees in one night, viz:—the Ma rk Master, Past Master, Most Excellent Master, and Royal Arch degrees. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"T EST -O ATH AND W ORD . The following \"test-oath and word\" were inve nted and adopted by th e \"Grand Lodge\" of the State of New York, at their Session in June, 1827, for the purpose of guarding against B OOK Masons. They are given in a Master's Lodge. They were obtained from a gentleman in high standing in society, and among Ma sons, but a friend to Anti-Masonr y. He was a member of the \"Grand Lodge,\" and present when they were adopted. A person wishing to be admitted into the Lodge, pr esents himself at the door; the Tyler (or some brother from within) demands or asks, \"Do you wi sh to visit this Lodge?\" The candidate for admission says, \"If thought worthy.\" T YLER —\"By what are you recommended?\" A NS . —\"By fidelity.\" T YLER says, \"Prove that;\" at the same time adva nces and throws out his hand or arm to an angle of about forty-five degrees obliquely forward, the hand open, and thumb upward.

One rap calls the Lodge to order; one calls up the Junior and Senior Deacons; two raps call up the subordinate officers; and three, all the memb ers of the Lodge. The Right Worshipful Master having called the Lodge to order, and all being s eated, the Right Worshipful Master says to the Junior Warden, \"Brother Junior, are they all Mark Master Masons in the South?\" Junior Warden answers, \"They are, Right Worshipful.\" R.

Brethren, attend to giving the signs.\" [Pg 61] The Right Worshipful Master (all the brethr en imitating him) extends his left arm from his body, so as to form an angle of about forty-five degr ees, and holds his right hand transv ersely across his left, the palms thereof about an inch apar t. This is called the fi rst sign of a Mason—is th e sign of distress in the first degree, and alludes to the position a candidate 's hands are placed when he takes the obligation of an Entered Apprentice Mason; he then draw s his right hand across his throat, the hand open, with his thumb next his throat, dr ops it down by his side. This is call ed the due-guard of an Entered Apprentice Mason, and alludes to the penal part of the obligation. Next he places the palm of his open right hand upon his left breast, and, at the same time, throws up his left hand, and so extends his left arm as to form a right angle; from the sh oulder to the elbow it is horizontal, from the elbow to the tip of the finger it is perpendicular. This is the sign and due-guard of a Fellow Craft Mason, and also alludes to the pe nal part of the obligation, which is admi nistered in this degree. After this, the Right Worshipful Master draw s his right hand across his bowel s, with his hand open, and thumb next his body, and drops it down by hi s side. This is the sign or due-g uard of a Master Mason, and, like the others, alludes to the penalty of this de gree. He then throws up the grand hailing sign of distress; this is given by rais ing both hands and arms to the elbow, perpendicularly, one on each side of the head, the elbows forming a square, his arms then drop by his side; he then clutches the third and little fingers of his right hand; with hi s thumb extended at the same time, his middle and forefingers, brings up his hand in such a manner as to have the side of the middle finger touch the rim of the right ear, then lets it drop, and, as it falls, brings the out ward side of the little finger of the left hand across the wrist of the right, then le ts them fall by his sides. This is the sign or due- guard of a Mark Master Mason, and also alludes to the penal part of the obligation in this degree. Here it is proper to remark that in the opening of any Lodge of Masons, they commence giving the signs of an Entered Apprentice, and go through all the signs of the different degrees, in regular gradation, until they arrive to the one which they are opening, and commence at the sign of the degree in which they are at work, and descend to the last when closing. After going through all the signs, as before described, the Right Worshipful Master declares the Lodge opened in the following manner: \"I now declare this Lodge of Mark Ma ster Masons duly opened for the dispatch of"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"business.\" The Senior Warden declares it to the J unior Warden, and he to the brethren. The Right Worshipful Master then repeats a charge: \"Wherefore, brethren, lay aside all malice and guile,\" &c., &c. The Lodge being opened and ready for business, the Right Worshipful Master directs the Secretary to read the minut es of the last meeting, which generally brings to view the business of the present. If there are any candidate s to be brought forward, that is generally the first business. A Master Mason, wishing for further light in Masonry, sends a petition to the Chapter, and requests to be advanced to the honorary degree of Mark Master Maso n; if there is no se rious objection to the petition, it is entered on the minutes, and a committee of several appointed [Pg 62] to inquire into his character, and report to the next regular communicat ion: at that time, if the committee report in his favor, and no serious objection is made against hi m otherwise, a motion is made that the ballot pass; if carried, the Deacons pass the ballot boxes; these boxes are the same as in the preceding degrees. When the balls ar e received, the box is pres ented to the Right Wors hipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. R. W. M.—\"Clear in th e West, Brother Senior?\" S. W.—\"Clear, Right Worshipful.\" R. W. M.—\"Clear in the South, Brother Junior?\" J. W.—\"Clear, Right Worshipful.\" Right Worshipful Master says, \"Clear in the East .\" This being the case, the candidate is accepted; but if there is one black ball in that end of the box wh ich has the white tube, and the Senior Warden pronouncing \"Not clear,\" all stop, and inquiry is made, and the ballot passes again; and, if blacked a third time, the candidate is reject ed. It being otherwise, the Senior Deacon, who is the candidate's conductor, passes out of th e Lodge into the adjoining room, wher e the candidate is in waiting, and there the conductor is furnished with a small oblong square, six in ches long; the candidate is presented with a large white marble keystone , weighing, probably, twenty pounds, and is ordered, by his conductor, to take it by the little end, between his first and second fingers and thumb of his right hand. The door is then opened without cer emony, and they pass directly to the Junior Overseer's station at the South gate, which is noth ing more than the Junior Warden's seat, and the conductor gives four raps, with his block of timber, on a pedestal in front of the Junior Overseer's station. J. O.—\"Who comes here?\" Cond.—\"Two br other Fellow Crafts, w ith materials for the Temple.\" J. O.—\"Have you a specimen of your la bor?\" Cond.—\"I have.\" J. O.—\"Present it.\" The conductor then presents the piece of timber before described; the Junior Overseer receives it, and applies a small trying square to its different angles , and they agreeing with the angles of the square, he says, \"This is good work, square work, such work as we are authorized to receive.\" Returns the block of timber, and turning his eye upon the candi date, asks, \"Who is this you have with you?\" Cond.—\"A brother Fellow Craft.\" J. O.—\"Have you a specimen of your labor?\" Cand.—\"I have.\" J. O.—\"Present it.\" The candidate then presents the keystone; the Junior Overseer receives it, and applies his square to all its angles, and they not agreeing with the angles of the square, he says, \"What have you here, brother? this is neither an oblong nor a square, neither ha s it the regular mark of the craft upon it, but from its singular form an d beauty, I am unwilling to reject it; pass on to the Senior Overseer at the West gate for further inspec tion.\" They then pass on to the Senior Overseer's station at the West gate, which is the Senior Ward en's seat, and give four raps, as before, on the pedestal which stands in front of the Senior Overseer. S. O.—\"Who comes here?\" Cond.—\"Two brother Fellow Crafts, with materials for the Temple.\" S. O.—\"Have you a specimen of your labor?\" Cond.—\"I have.\" S. O.—\"Present it.\" The conductor, as before, presents the block of timber; the Senior Overseer applies his square to it, and finding it agrees with the angles of his square, says, \"This is good work, square work, such [Pg 63] work as we are authorized to receive; who is this you have with you?\" Cond.—\"A brothe r Fellow Craft.\" S. O.—\" Have you a specimen of your labor?\" Cand.—\"I have.\" S. O.—\"Present it.\" The candidate th en presents the keystone, and he applies it, but not fitting, he says, \"This is neither an oblong nor a square, neit her has it the regular mark of the craft upon it; it is a curious wrought stone, a nd on account of its singular form and beauty, I am unwilling to reject it; pass on to th e Master Overseer at the East gate for further inspection.\" They pass to to his station at the Ea st gate, and give four raps. M. O.—\"Who comes"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"here?\" Cond.—\"Two brethren, Fello w Crafts, with their materials for the Temple.\" M. O.—\"Have you a specimen of your labor?\" Cond.—\"I have.\" M. O.—\"Present it.\" The conductor presents his billet of wood to him, applies hi s square to it, and, lik e the other Overseers, says, \"This is good work, square work, such work as we are authorized to receive; w ho is this you ha ve with you?\" Cond.—\"A brother Fellow Craft.\" M. O.—\"Have you a specimen of your labor?\" Cand.—\"I have.\" M. O.—\"Present it.\" [It ought here to be remarked that when the candidate is presented with the keystone, and takes it between his thumb and two fi ngers, it hangs suspended by his side, and he is requested to carry his work plumb, and the conducto r taking good care to see th at he does it, by the time he arrives at the Master Overseer's station at the East gate, and when th e Master Overseer says \"Present it,\" the candidate is extremely willing to hand over the keystone to him for inspection; for, by this time, it becomes very painful to hold any longer the stone which he has in charge.] The Master Overseer having received the keystone, he applies his square to the different angles of it, and, being found not to be square, he, like the othe r Overseers, says, \"This is neither an oblong nor a square, neither has it the regular mark of the craft upon it.\" He then looks sternly upon the candidate and demands, \"Is this your work?\" Cand.—\"It is not.\" M. O.—\"Is this your mark?\" Cand.—\"It is not.\" M. O.—\"Where did you get it?\" Cond.—\"I picked it up in the quarry.\" M. O.— \"Picked it up in the quarry? this explains the matte r; what! been loitering aw ay your time this whole week, and now brought up another man's work to impose upon the Grand Overseers! this deserves the severest punishment. [Motions the candidate to stand.] Brother Junior and Senior Overseers, here is work brought up for inspection which dema nds a council.\" The Junior, Senior, and Master Overseers then assemble in council. M. O., pres enting the stone—\"Did a Fe llow Craft present this to you for inspection, Brother Junior?\" J. O.—\"A Fe llow Craft came to my office and presented this stone for inspection; I examined it, and found it was neither an oblong nor a square, neither, had it the regular mark of the craft upon it; but on account of its singular form and beauty, I was unwilling to reject it, and ordered it to th e Senior Overseer at the West gate for further inspection.\" M. O.— \"Brother Senior, was this stone presented to you for inspection?\" S. O.—\"It was; I know of no use for it in the Temple; I tried it with the square, and observed it was neither an oblong nor a square, neither had it the regular mark of the craft upon it; but on account of its singular form and beauty, I was unwilling to reject it, and, therefore, directed it [Pg 64] to the Master Overseer at the East gate for further inspection.\" M. O.—\"It wa s also presented to me for inspection, but I do not know of any use which it can be in the buildi ng.\" S. O.—\"I know of no use for it.\" J. O.—\"I know of no use for it.\" M. O.—\"Brother Senior, what shall we do with it?\" S. O.—\"Heave it over among the rubbish.\" The Master and Senior Overseers then take the stone between them, and after waving it backward and forward four times, they heave it over in such a manner that the one le tting go while the stone is arriving at the highest point, it brings the stone in a quarterl y direction over the other's left shoulder; the Junior Overseer, being stationed in a suitable position, at this moment receives the stone, and carries it away into the preparation ro om. R. W. M.—\"Brother Se nior Warden, assemble the crafts to receive wages.\" At this command the brethren all arise, and fo rm a procession single file; the candidate is placed at the head of the procession, and when stationed, is told that \"the last shall be first, and the first last.\" The pr ocession being formed, th ey commence singing the following song: \"Mark Masters all a ppear,\" &c., and, at the same time, commence a circular march (against the course of the sun) around the room, giving all the si gns during their march, beginning with that of Entered Apprentice, and ending at that of Mark Master. They are given in the following manner: The first revolution each brother, when opposite the Right Worshipful Master, gives the first sign in Masonry. The second revolution, wh en opposite the Master, the second; and so on, until they give all the signs to that of Mark Master. While the ceremony is going on in the Lodge, the Senior Grand Warden procur es a sufficient number of cents and passes into the preparation room, and opens a lattice window in the door whic h communicates to the Lodge room, and when the craftsmen arrive to the Mark Master Mason's sign, each of them, in their last revolution, puts his hand through the window in the door and gives a toke n (this is given by shuttin g the third and little"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"fingers, extending the fore and middle fingers, a nd placing the thumb over them in a suitable manner to receive the penny or cent), and receives a penny or cent from the Senior Grand Warden. Matters are so timed in the march, that when th ey come to that part of the song which says, \"Caution them to beware of the right hand,\" it comes the turn of the candidate to put his hand through the aperture of the door an d receive his penny, but not being ab le to give the token, he is detected as an impostor, and the Senior Grand Warden, instead of giving him his penny, seizes him by the hand and draws his arm full length through the door and holds him se curely, exclaiming at the same time, \"An impostor! an impostor!\" Others , who are in the room with the Senior Grand Warden, cry out, \"Chop off his hand! chop off his ha nd!\" At this moment the conductor steps to the candidate and intercedes warmly in his behalf. Cond.—\"Spare him! spare him!\" S. G. W.—\"He is an impostor. He has attempted to receive wages w ithout being able to give the token. The penalty must be inflicted.\" Cond.—\"He is a brother Fello w Craft, and on condition that you will release him, I will be responsible that he shall be taken before the Right Worshipful Master, where all the circumstances shall be made known, and, if he condemns [Pg 65] him, I will see that the penalty is inflicted.\" S. G. W.—\"On these conditions, I rel ease him.\" The candidate is released, and taken before the Right Worshipful Master. Cond.—\"Th is young Fellow Craft has brought up work for inspection, which was not his own, a nd has attempted to receive wages for it; he was detected at the Senior Grand Warden's apartment as an imposto r, and I became responsible, on condition of his release, that he should appear before the Right Worshipful, and if, after a fair trial, you should pronounce him guilty, that I should see the penalty of an impostor inflicte d upon him.\" R. W. M.— \"Brother Junior Overseer, did this man bring up wo rk to your station for inspection?\" J. O.—\"He did. I inspected it, and observed th at it was neither an oblong nor a square, neither ha d it the regular mark of the craft upon it; but on account of its singular form and beauty, I was unwilling to reject it; therefore, I ordered it passed to the Senior Ov erseer's station at the West gate for further inspection.\" R. W. M.—\"Brothe r Senior Overseer, did this young man bring up work to you for inspection?\" S.

I rebuked him severely for his attempt to impose upon the Gr and Overseers, and for lo itering away his time, and then bringing up another man's work for in spection. I then called a council of my brother Overseers, and we, knowing no use for the wor k, hove it over among the rubbish.\" R. W.

W. M.—\"Young man, it appears that you ha ve been loitering away your time this whole week, and have now brought up another man's work for inspection, to impose upon the Grand Overseers, and what is more, you have attemp ted to receive wages for labor which you never performed; conduct like this deserves prompt punish ment. The penalty of an impostor is that of having his right hand chopped off. This young man a ppears as though he deserv ed a better fate, and as though he might be serviceable in the buildi ng of the Temple. Are you a Fellow Craft?\" Cand.— \"I am.\" R. W. M.—\"Can you give us any proof of it?\" Candidate gives the sign of a Fellow Craft. R. W. M.—\"He is a Fellow Craft. Have you ever been taught how to receive wages?\" Cand.—\"I have not.\" R. W. M.—\"This serves, in a measure, to mitigate his crime. If you are instructed how to receive wages, will you do better in future, and never again attempt to impose on the Grand Overseers, and, above all, neve r attempt to receive wages for [Pg 66] labor which you never performed.\" Cand.—\"I will.\" R. W.

W. M.—\"Brother Junior, see the cause of that alarm.\" The Junior Warden then steps to the door and answers the alarm by four knocks, the conductor and himself each giving another; the door is then par tly opened, and the Junior Warden then asks, \"Who comes there?\" Cond.—\"A worthy brother, who ha s been regularly init iated as an Entered Apprentice, served a proper time as such; passed to the degree of Fellow Craft; raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason; and now wishes further light in Masonr y, by being advanced to the more honorable degree of a Mark Master Mason.\" J.

You will let him wait until the Right Worshipful Master is made acquainted with his request and his answer returned.\" The Junior Ward en returns him to the Right Worshipful Master, where the same questions are asked and answers returned, as at the door. The Right Worshipful Master then says, \"Since he comes endowed with the necessary qualifications, let him enter in the name of the Lord, and take heed on what he enters .

As this is the business of no particular officer, we have, for convenience, styled him executioner.] Brother, it becomes my duty to put a mark on you, and such a one, too, as you will probably carry to your grave.\" Places the edge of the chisel near his left breast and makes several motions with the mallet, as though he was about to strike upon the head of the chisel. Executioner—\"This is a painful undertaking; I do not feel able to perform it, Right Worshipful (turni ng to the Right Worshipful Master); this task is too painful; I feel that I cannot perform it; I wish the Right Wo rshipful would select some other brother to perform it in my stead.\" R.

The executioner then places the edge of the chisel near the spot and draws back the mallet, and while making several false motions, says, \"Operative Masons make use of the engr aving chisel and mallet to cut, hew, carve, and indent their work; but we , as Free and Accepted Masons, make use of them for a more noble and glorious purpose; we use th em to cut, hew, carve, and indent the mind;\" giving, at the instant the last wo rd is pronounced, a severe blow w ith the mallet upon the head of the chisel, without the leas t injury to the candidate, which often terrifies him to an alarming degree.

To all of which I do most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with a fixed and steady purpose of mind in me, to keep and perform the same, binding myself under no less penalty than to have my right ear smote off, that I may forever be unable to hear the word, and my right hand chopped off, as the penalty of an impostor, if I should ever prove wilfully guilty of violating any part of this my solemn oath or obligation of a Mark Master Mason. So help me God, and make me steadfast to keep and perform the same.\" \"Detach your hand and kiss the book\" The Master then produces the same keystone, concerning which so much has already been said, and says to the candidate, \"We read in a passage of Scripture—Rev.

These, placed in this form were the mark of our Grand Master, Hira m Abiff.

Is this the way you mind your ob ligations? Here I presented my ma rk with a request for a small favor; you say you cannot grant it, and offer to return my MARK alone? Where is the quarter of a dollar you have sworn to return with it?\" The candidate, much embarrassed, answers, \"I cannot do even that. I have no money about me. It was a ll taken from me in the preparation room.\" The Master asks, \"Are you quite sure you have none?\" Candidate answers, \"I am, it is all in the other room.\" [Pg 69] Master—\"You have not examined; perhaps some friend has, in pity to your destitute situation, supplied you with that amount unknown to yourself; feel in all your pockets, and if you find, after a thorough search, that yo u have really none, we shall have less reason to think that you meant wilfully to violate your ob ligation.\" The candidate examines his pockets and finds a quarter of a dollar, which some brother ha d slyly placed there; this adds not a little to his embarrassment; he protests he had no intention of concealing it; really supposed he had none about him, and hands it to the Master, with his mark. Th e Master receives it and says to the candidate, \"Brother, let this scene be a striking lesson to you: should you ever hereaf ter have a mark presented you by a worthy brother, asking a favor, before you deny him make diligent search, and be quite sure of your inability to serve him; perhaps you will then fi nd, as in the present instance, that some unknown person has befriended you, and you are really in a better situation than you think yourself.\" The candidate then rises and is made acquainted with the grips, words, and si gns of this degree. The pass-grip of this degree is made by extending th e right arms and clasping the fingers of the right hands, as one would naturally do to assist a nother up a steep ascent; the pass-word is \" J OPPA ;\" the real grip is made by locking th e little fingers of the right ha nd, bringing the knuckles together, placing the ends of the thumbs against each other; the word is \"Mark well.\" The signs have been described. After the grips, words, and signs are give n and explained (see Lectures), the Master says, \"Brother, I now present you with the tools of a Mark Master (here he points them out in the carpet, or in the chart), which are the chisel and mallet; they are thus explained: The chisel morally demonstrates the advantages of discipline and ed ucation; the mind, like the diamond in its original state, is rude and unpolished, but as the effect of the chisel on th e external coat soon presents to view the latent beauties of the diamond, so education discovers the latent beauties of the mind, and draws them forth to range the large field of matter and space, to display the summit of human knowledge, our duty to God and man. The mallet mora lly teaches to correct irregularities, and to reduce man to a proper level; so that by quiet deportm ent, he may, in the school of discipline, learn to be content. What the mallet is to the workme n, enlightened reason is to the passions; it curbs ambition, it depresses envy, it modera tes anger, and it encourages good dispositions, whence arises among good Masons that comely order, 'Which nothing earthly gives, or can destroy, The soul's calm sunshine, and the heartfelt joy.'\" The Worshipful Master then delivers a charge to the candidate, which completes the ceremony of advancement to this degree.

The Worshipful Master says, \"Brother Junior Warden, assemble the brethren, and form a procession for the purpose of closing the Lodge.\" [Pg 70] The brethren then assemble and commence a circular march, singing the s ong, \"Mark Masons all appear.\" Af ter the song is completed, the brethren compare the wages they have received, a nd finding that all have received alike (one penny or cent), they begin to murmur among themselves , some pretending to think they ought to have more, as they have done all the labor. They fina lly throw down their wages upon the altar, declaring if they cannot be dealt justly with, they will have none. The Worshipful Master calls to order, and demands the cause of the confusion. Some brother an swers, \"Worshipful, we are not satisfied with the manner of paying the workmen, for we find those who have done nothing, and even the candidate just received, is paid just as much as we, who have borne the heat and burden of the day.\" Master says, \"It is perfectly right.\" Brother— \"It cannot be right—it is very unreasonable.\" Master—\"Hear what the law says on the subject.\" He then re ads the following parable—Matt. XX. 1-16. \"For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers in to his vineyard. And when he ha d agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out a bout the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market-place, and said unto them , 'Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, I will give you.' And they went their way. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, 'Why stand ye he re all the day idle?' They sa y unto him, 'Because no man hath hired us.' He saith unto them, 'Go ye also into the vineyard, and what soever is right, that shall ye receive.' So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard said unto his steward, 'Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.' And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a pe nny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more, and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had received it, they murmured agai nst the good man of the house, saying, 'These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made th em equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.' But he answ ered one of them and said, 'Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst thou not agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, a nd go thy way; I will give unto this last even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I w ill with mine own? Is th ine eye evil because I am good?

By what will you be tried? A. By the engraving chisel and mallet. [Pg 71] Q. Why by the engraving chisel and mallet? A. Because they are the proper masonic implements of this degree. Q. On what was the degree founded? A. On a cer tain keystone which belonged to the principal arch of King Solomon's Temple. Q. Who formed this keystone? A. Ou r worthy Grand Master, Hiram Abiff. Q. What were the preparatory steps relative to your advancement to this degree? A. I was caused to represent one of the Fellow Craft at the bu ilding of King Solomon's Temple, whose custom it was, on the eve of every sixth day, to carry up their work for inspection. Q. Why was you caused to represent these Fellow Crafts? A. Because our worthy Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, had completed this keystone agreeable to the original plan, and before he gave orders to have it carried up to the Temple, was slain by three ruffians, as already represented in the preceding degrees; and it so happened that on the eve of a certain sixth day, as the craft were carrying up work for inspection, a young Fellow Craft discovered this stone in the quarry, and from its singular form and beauty, supposing it to belong to some part of the Temple, carried it up for inspection. Q. Who inspected it? A. The Grand Overseers, placed at the East, West, and South gates. Q. How did they inspect it? A. On its being presented to the Junior Overseer at the South gate, he observed that it was neither an obl ong or a square, neither had it th e regular mark of the craft upon it; but from its singular form and beauty was unwilling to reject it, therefore ordered it to be passed to the Senior Overseer at the West gate for further inspectio n; who, for similar reasons, suffered it to pass to the Master Overseer at the East gate, who held a consul tation with his brother Overseers, and they observed, as before, that it was neither an oblong or square , neither had it the regular mark of the craft upon it; and neither of them being Mark Master Masons, supposed it of no use in the building, and hove it over among the rubbish. Q. How many Fellow Crafts were there engage d at the building of the Temple? A. Eighty thousand. Q. Were not the Master Overse ers liable to be imposed upon by receiving bad work from the hands of such a vast number of workmen? A. They were not. Q. How was this imposition prevented? A. By th e wisdom of King Solomon, who wisely ordered that the craftsman who worked should choose him a particular mark and place it upon all his work; by which it was known and distinguished when carri ed up to the buildi ng, and, if approved, to receive wages. Q. What was the wages of a Fellow Craft? A. A penny a day. Q. Who paid the craftsmen? A. The Senior Grand Warden. Q. Was not the Senior Grand Warden liable to be imposed upon by impostors in paying off such a vast number of workmen? A. He was not. Q. How was this imposition prevented? A.

By being divested of all my outward appa rel and all money; my breast bare, with a cable-tow f our times about my body, in which situation I was conducted to the door of a Lodge, where I gave four distinct knocks. Q. What do these four distinct knocks allude to? A. To the fourth degree of Masonry; it being that on which I was about to enter. Q. What was said to you from within? A. Who comes there? Q.

I was asked if it was of my own free will and accord I made this request; if I was duly and truly prepared; worthy and well qualified; had wrought in the quarries, and exhibited specimens of my skill and proficiency in the preceding degrees; all of which being answered in the affirmative, I was asked by what further right or benefit I expected to gain this favor. Q. Your answer? A. By the benefit of a pass-word. Q. What was that pass-word? A. J OPPA . Q. What did it allude to? A. The city of Joppa , the place where the materials were landed for building king Solomon's Temple, after being prepar ed in the forest of Lebanon, and carried there on floats (by sea). [Masonic tradition informs us that the banks of this place are so perpendicular that it was impossible to ascend them without assistan ce from above, which was effected by brethren stationed there, with this strong grip; this has been explained; which, together with the word J OPPA , has since been adopted as a prope r pass to be given before ente ring any well-regulated Lodge of Mark Master Masons.] Q.

"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE PAST MASTER'S DEGREE. This degree is very simple. It is necessary that a Master Mason s hould take this degree before he can, constitutionally, preside over a Lodge of Master Masons as Ma ster of it; and when a Master Mason is elected Master of a Lodge, who has not prev iously received the Past Master's degree, it is then conferred upon him, often without any othe r ceremony than that of administering the obligation. This Lodge is opened and closed in the same manner that the L odges of the first three degrees are; the candidate pe titions and is balloted for in the same ma nner, but he is received into the Lodge in a very different manner. He is conducted into the Lodge without any previous preparation, when the presiding officer rises and says, \"Brethren, it is inconvenient for me to serve you any longer as Master of this Lodge. I wish you would select so me other brother for that purpose.\" The candidate is nominated, the usual forms of balloting for offi cers are then dispensed with, and a vote of the Lodge is taken by yeas and nays. The candidate is el ected, and generally refuses to serve, but he is eventually prevailed on to accept; whereupon the pres iding officer addresses the Master-elect in the words following, viz.: \"Brother, previous to your investiture, it is necessary that you assent to those ancient charges and regulations, which point out the duty of a Master of a Lodge. 1. You agree to be a good man and true, and strictly to obey the moral law. 2. You agree to be a peaceable subject, and cheerfully to conform to the laws of the country in which you reside. 3. You promise not to be concerned in any plots or conspiracies against government; but patiently to submit to the decisions of the supreme legislature. 4. You agree to pay a proper respect to the civil magistrate, to work diligently, live creditably, and act honorably by all men. 5. You agree to hold in veneration the original rules and patrons of Masonry, and their regular successors, supreme and subordinate, according to th eir stations, and to submit to the awards and resolutions of your brethren when convened, in every case consistent with the constitution of the Order. 6. You agree to avoid private piques and quarrels, and to guard against intemperance and excess. 7. You agree to be cautious in carriage and behavior, cautious to your brethren, and faithful to your Lodge. 8. You promise to respect genuine brethren and di scountenance impostors, and all dissenters from the original plan of Masonry. 9. You agree to promote the general good of society, to cultivate the social virtues, and to propagate a knowledge of the arts. [Pg 76] 10. You promise to pay homage to the Grand Master for the time being, and to his officer when duly installed, strictly to conform to every edict of the Grand Lodge or General Assembly of Masons that is not subversive of the principles and ground work of Masonry. 11. You admit that it is not in the power of any man, or body of men, to make innovations in the body of Masonry. 12. You promise a regular attendance on the committees and communications of the Grand Lodge, on receiving proper notice, and to pay attention to all the duties of Masonry on convenient occasions."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"13. You admit that no new Lodge can be formed without permission of the Grand Lodge, and that no countenance be given to any irregular Lodge, or to any person clandestinely initiated therein, being contrary to the ancient charges of the Order. 14. You admit that no person can be regularly made a Mason in, or admitted a member of any regular Lodge, without previous notice, and due inquiry into his character. 15. You agree that no visitors shall be received into your Lodge without due examination, and producing proper vouchers of their having been initiated into a regular Lodge.\" The presiding officer then asks the Master-ele ct (candidate), the following question, which he must answer in the affirmative: Q. \"Do you subm it to these charges and promise to support these regulations as Masters have done, in all ages, before you?\" A. \"I do.\" The presiding officer then addresses him: \"Brother A. B., in consequence of your cheerful conformity to the charges and regulations of the Order, you are no w to be installed Master of this degree, in full confidence of your care, skill, and capacity, to govern the same. Bu t previous to your investiture, it is necessary you should take upon yourself the solemn oath or obl igation appertaining to this degree; if you are willing to take it upon you, you will please to kneel before the altar, wh en you shall receive the same.\" [Here Lodges differ very materially, but this is the most prevalent mode of proceeding.] The candidate then kneels on both knees, lays both hands on the Holy Bible, Square and Compass, and takes the following oa th or obligation: \"I, A. B., of my own free will and accord, in pres ence of Almighty God, and this Right Worshipful Lodge of Past Master Masons, do hereby and hereon, most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, in addition to my former obligations, that I will not give the degree of Past Master Mason, or any of the secrets pertaining thereto, to anyone of an inferior degree, nor to any person in the known world, except it be to a true and lawful brother or brethren Past Master Masons, or within the body of a just and lawfully constituted Lodge of such, and not unto him or unto them whom I shall hear so to be, but unto him and them only whom I shall find so to be, after strict trial and examination, or lawful information. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will obey all regular signs and summons sent, thrown, handed, or given from the hand of a brother of this degree, or from the body of a just and lawfully constituted Lodge of Past Masters, provided it be within the length of my cable-tow. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will support the constitution of the General Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the United States of America, also that of the Grand Chapter of the State of ——, under which this Lodge is held, and conform to all the by-laws, rules and regulations of this or any other Lodge, of which I may at any time hereafter become a member, so far as in my power. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not assist, or be present at the conferring of this degree upon any person who has not, to the best of my knowledge and belief, regularly received the degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, Master Mason, and Mark Master, or been elected Master of a regular Lodge of Master [Pg 77] Masons. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will ai d and assist all poor and indigent Past Master Masons, their widows and orphans, wherever dispersed around the globe, they applying to me as such, and I finding them worthy, so far as in my power, without material injury to myself or family. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that the secrets of a brother of this degree, delivered to me in charge as such, shall remain as secure and inviolable in my breast as they were in his own, before communicated to me, murder and treason excepted, and those left to my own election. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not wrong this Lodge, or a brother of this degree, to the value of one cent, knowingly, myself, nor suffer it to be done by others, if in my power to prevent it. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not govern this L odge, nor any other over which I may be called to preside, in a haughty, arbitrary, or impious manner; but will at all times use my utmost endeavors to preserve peace and harmony among the brethren. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will never open a Lodge of Master Masons, unless there be pr esent three regular Master Masons, besides the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Tyler, nor close the same without giving a Lecture, or some section or part of a Lecture, for the instruction of the Lodge. Furthermore, that I will not, knowingly, set in any Lodge where anyone presides who has not received the degree of Past Master. [This last point is, in many Lodges, entirely omitted. In some, the two last.] All which I do most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with a fixed and steady purpose of mind, to keep and perform the same, binding myself under no less penalty than to have my tongue split from tip to root, that I might forever thereafter be unable to pronounce the word, if ever I should prove wilfully guilty of violati ng any part of this my solemn oath or obligation of a Past Master Mason. So help me God, and make me steadfast to keep and perform the same.\" The obligation being administ ered, the candidate rises, [4] and the Master proceeds to give the sign, word, and grip of this degree, as follows: The sign (sometimes called the due-guard) is given by laying the edge of the thumb of the right hand in a vertical position on the centre of the mouth, high enough to touch the upper lip. The word is given by taking each other by the Master's grip, and pulling the insides of thei r feet together, when the Master whispers the word, \" G IBLEM ,\" [5] in the ear of the candidate. Then they clap their left hand on each other's righ t arm, between the wrist and elbow, disengaging (at the same moment) their right hand from the Master's grip; they each seize the left arm of the other with their right hands, between the wrist a nd elbow, and (almost at the same instant) yielding their left hand hold on each other's right arm, and moving their left hands with a brisk motion, they clasp e ach other's right arm with thei r left hands, above the elbow, pressing their finger nails hard against the arms, as they shift their hands from place to place; and the Master says (in union with these movements), \"F rom grips to spans, and from spans to grips: a twofold cord is strong, but a th reefold cord is not easily broken.\" The Master then conducts the candidate to the chair, and, as he ascends the steps, the Master says, \"Brother, I now have the pleasure of conducting you into the oriental chair of King Solomon;\" places a large cocked hat on his head, and comes down to the front of the newly-inst alled Master, and [Pg 78] addresses him as follows: \"Worshipful brother, I now present you with the furniture and various implements of our profession; they are emblematical of our conduct in life, and will now be enumerated and explained as presented. The H OLY W RITINGS , that great light in Masonry, will guide you to all truth; it will direct your path to the temple of happiness, and point out to you the whole duty of man. The S QUARE teaches to regulate our actions by rule and line, and to harm onize our conduct by the principles of morality and virtue. The C OMPASS teaches to limit our desires in every station; thus rising to eminence by merit, we may live respected, and die regretted. The R ULE directs that we should punctually observe our duty; press forward in the path of virtue, and neither inclining to the right or to the left, in all our actions have ETERNITY in view. The L INE teaches the criterion of moral rectitude; to avoid dissimulation in conversat ion and action, and to direct our steps to the path that leads to IMMORTALITY . The B OOK OF C ONSTITUTIONS you are to search at all times; cause it to be read in your Lodge, that none may pretend ignor ance of the excellent precepts it enjoins. Lastly, you receive in charge the by-laws of your Lodge, whic h you are to see carefully and punctually executed. I will also pr esent you with the malle t; it is an emblem of power. One stroke of the mallet calls to order, and calls up the Juni or and Senior Deacons; two strokes call up all the subordinate officers; and three, the whole Lodge.\" The following char ge is then delivered to the newly-installed Master (alias ca ndidate) by the former Master: \"Worshipful Master, being appointed Master of this Lodge, you cannot be insensible of the obligations which devolve on you as their head; nor of your responsibility for the faithful discharge of the important duties annexed to your appointment. The honor, usefulness, and reputation of your Lodge will materially depend on the skill and assiduity with which you manage its concerns; while the happiness of its members will be generally promoted, in proportion to the zeal and ability with which you propagate the genuine principles of our institution. For a pattern of information, consider the luminary of nature, which, rising in the East, regularly di ffuses light and lustre to all within its circle. In like manner, it is your province to spread and communicate light and instruction to the brethren of your"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Lodge. Forcibly impress upon them the dignity and high importance of Masonry, and seriously admonish them never to disgrace it. Charge them to practice out of the Lodge those duties which they have been taught in it; and by amiable, discreet , and virtuous conduct, to convince mankind of the goodness of the institution, so that, when anyone is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrows—to whom distress may prefer its suit— whose hand is guided by justice, and his heart expanded by benevolence. In short, by a diligent observance of the by-laws of your Lodge, the c onstitution of Masonry, and, above all, the Holy Scriptures, which are given as a rule and guide of yo ur faith, you will be enabled to acquit yourself with honor and reputation, and lay up a crown of rejoicing which shall continue when time shall be no more.\" [6] The Master then says to the ne wly-installed Master, \"I now le ave you to the government of your Lodge.\" He then retires to a seat, and, after a moment or two, rises and addresses the candidate (now in the chair as [Pg 79] Master), \"Worshipful Master, in c onsequence of my resignation, and the election of a new Master, the seats of the Warden s have become vacant. It is necessary you should have Wardens to assist you in the government of your Lodge. The constitution requires us to elect our officers by ballot, but it is common, on occasions of this kind, to dispense with those formalities, and elect by ayes and noes; I move we do so on the present occasion.\" The question is tried and carried in the affirmativ e. The Master has a right to nomi nate one candidate for office, and the brethren one. Here a scene of confusion take s place, which is not easily described. The newly- installed W ORSHIPFUL is made the butt for every WORTHY brother to exercise his wit upon. Half a dozen are up at a time, soliciting the Master to nominate them for Wardens, urging their several claims, and decrying the merits of others with much zeal, others crying out, \"Order, Worshipful, keep order!\" Others propose to dance, and request the Master to sing for them; others whistle, or sing, or jump about the room; or scuffle, and knoc k down chairs or benches. One proposes to call from labor to refreshment; another compliments the Worshipful Master on his dignified appearance, and knocks off his hat, or pulls it down over his face; another informs him that a lady wishes to enter. If the Master calls to order, ev ery one obeys the signal with the utmost promptness, and drops upon the nearest seat; the next instant, before the Master can utter a word, all are on their feet again and as noisy as ever . Finally, a nominal election is e ffected, and some prudent member, tired of such a ridiculous conf usion, moves that the Lodge be closed; which, being done, the poor (and if a stranger) much embarrassed candidate, has hi s big hat taken from him, and is reduced to the ranks; but, for his consolation, the Worshipful Master informs him that the preceding scene, notwithstanding its apparent confus ion, is designed to convey to him, in a striking manner, the important lesson, never to solicit or accept any of fice or station for which he does not know himself amply qualified. The Lecture on the fifth, or Past Master's degree, is divided into five sections. The first section treats of the manner of constituting a Lodge of Master Masons. The second treats of the ceremony of installation, including the manner of receiving candidates to this degree, as given above. The third treats of the cere monies observed at laying the founda tion stones of public structures. The fourth section, of the ceremony observed at the dedications of Masonic halls. The fifth, of the ceremony observed at funerals, accor ding to ancient custom, with th e service used on the occasion. The foregoing includes all the ceremonies ever used in conferring the degree of Past Master; but the ceremonies are more frequently shortened by th e omission of some part of them; the presenting of the \"various implements of the profession,\" a nd their explanations, are often dispensed with; and still more often, the charge.

For he hath founded it upon the seas, and establishe d it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place?

Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts; he is the King of glory. Selah.\" The reading being ended, the Most Excellent Master then kneels, joins hands with the others , which closes the circle; they all lift their hands, as joined together, up and down six times, keeping time with th e words as the Most Excellent Master repeats [Pg 82] them—one, two, three; one, two, three. This is masonically called balancing. They then rise, disengage their hands, and lift them up above their heads with a moderate and somewhat graceful motion; cast up their eyes, turning, at the same time, to the right, they extend their arms and then suffer them to fall loose and nerveless against their sides. This sign is said by Masons to represent the sign of astonishment, made by the Queen of Sheba, on first viewing Solomon's Temple. The Most Excellent Master now resumes his seat and says, \"Brethren, at tend to giving the signs.\" The Most Excellent Master then gives all the signs fro m an Entered Apprentice Mason up to the degree of Most Excellent Master; in which they all jo in and imitate him.

The second time around, each gives two blows; the third, three; and so on, until they arrive to six. During this time, the Most Excellent Master reads the following passage of Scripture: Psalm cxxii. \"I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.

Immediately afte r this, the Senior Deacon and candidate arrive at the Junior Warden's station in the South, when the same questions are asked and answers returned, as at the door (Who comes here , etc.). The Junior Wa rden then directs the candidate to pass on to the Senior [Pg 84] Warden in the West for further examination; where the same questions are asked and answers returned, as before. The Senior Warden directs him to be conducted to the Right Worshipful Master in the East for further examination. The Right Worshipful Master asks the same questions, and rece ives the same answers as before. He then says, \"Please to conduct the candidate back to the West from whence he came, and put him in the care of the Senior Warden, and request him to teach the candidate how to approach the East, by advancing upon six upright regular steps to the sixth step, and place him in a proper position to take upon him the solemn oath or obligation of a Most Excellent Master Mason.\" The candidate is conducted back to the West, and put in care of the Senior Warden, who informs hi m how to approach the East, as directed by the Most Excellent Master. The cand idate kneels on both knees, and places both hands on the leaves of an opened Bible, Square and Compass. The Most Excellent Master now comes forward and says, \"Brother, you are now placed in a proper position to take upon you the solemn oath or obligation of a Most Excellent Master Ma son; which, I assure you, as before, is neither to affect your religion or politics. If you are willing to take it, repeat your name and say after me.\" The following obligation is then administered: \"I, A.

So help me God, and keep me steadfast in the due performance of the same.\" \"Detach your hands and kiss the book.\""},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The candidate is now requested to rise, and the Most Excellent Master gives him the sign, grip, and word appertaining to this degr ee. The sign is given by placing your hands, one on each breast, the fingers meeting in the centre of the body, and jerki ng them apart as though you were trying to tear open your breast; it alludes to the penalty of the obligation. The grip is given by taking each other by the right hand, and claspi ng them so that each compresses th e third finger of the other with his thumb. [If one hand is large an d the other small, they cannot bot h give the grip at the same time.] It is called the grip of all grips, because it is said to cover all the preceding grips. The Most Excellent holds the candidate by the hand, and puts the inside of his right foot to the inside of the candidate's right foot, and whispers in his ear, \" R ABBONI .\" In some Lodges the word is not given in a whisper, but in a low voice. After these cerem onies are over, and the me mbers seated, some noise is intentionally made by shuffling the feet. M. E. M.—\"Brother Seni or, what is the cause of this confusion?\" S. W.—\"Is not this the day set apart for the celeb ration of the copestone, Most Excellent?\" M. E. M.—\"I will ask Brother Secretary. Brother Secretary, is this the day set apart for the celebration of the copestone?\" Secretary (looking in his book)—\"It is, Most Excellent.\" M. E. M.—\"Brother Senior Warden, assemble the bret hren, and form a procession, for the purpose of celebrating the copestone.\" The brethren then assemb le (the candidate stands aside, not joining in the procession), form a procession double file, a nd march six times around the Lodge, against the course of the sun, singing the fo llowing song, and giving all the signs from an Entered Apprentice to that of Most Excellent Master. When opposite the Most Excellent Master, the first time they march around the Lodge, each member gives the first sign of an Entered Apprentice, and preserves it until he nearly arrives opposite the Most Excellent a second time, then gives the second sign, and continues it in the same manner, and so of a ll others, up to that of this degree, saying, All hail to the morning that bids us rejoice, The Temple's completed, exalt high each voice.The copestone is finished—our la bor is o'er,The sound of th e gavel shall hail us no more. To the power Almighty, who ever has guidedThe tr ibes of old Israel, exalting their fame;To Him who hath governed our hearts undivided,Let's send forth our vows to praise His great name. Companions, assemble on this joyful day (The occasion is glorious!) the keystone to lay; Fulfilled is the promise, by the A NCIENT OF D AYS , To bring forth the copestone with shouting and praise. The keystone is now produced and laid on the altar. There is no more occasion for level or plumb-line, [Pg 86] For trowel or gavel, for compass or square; [7] Our works are completed, the ark safely seated, [8] And we shall be greeted as workmen most rare. Names, those that are worthy our tribes, who ha ve shared,And proved themselves faithful, shall meet their reward;Their virtue and knowle dge, industry and skill,Have our approbation—have gained our good will.

Thy wisdom inspired the great institution,Thy strength shall support it till nature expire;And when the creation shall fall into ruin,Its beauty shall rise through the midst of the fire. [At the time the ark is placed on the altar, there is also placed on it a pot of incense, to which fire is communicated by the Most Excellent Master, just as the last line of the song is sung; this pot to contain incense is sometimes an el egant silver urn; but if the Lodge is too poor to afford that, a"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"common teapot, with spout and handle broken off, answers every purpose; for incense some pieces of paper are dipped in spirits of turpentine.] The members now all join hands, as in opening; a nd, while in this attitude, the Most Excellent reads the following passage of Scripture: 2 Chron. vii. 1-4. \"Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house. And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's house. And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord, saying, F OR H E IS GOOD ; [11] FOR H IS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER .\" The members now balance six times as before; in opening, rise and balance six times more, disengage themselves from each other and take thei r seats; the Most Excellent Master then delivers the following charge to the candidate: \"Brother, your admittance to this degree of Masonr y, is a proof of the good opinion the brethren of this Lodge entertain of your Masonic [Pg 87] abilities. Let this considerati on induce you to be careful of forfeiting by misconduct and inattention to our rules, that esteem which has raised you to the rank you now possess. \"It is one of your great duties, as a Most Excellent Master, to dispense light and truth to the uninformed Mason; and I need not remind you of th e impossibility of complying with this obligation without possessing an accurate acquaintance with the Lectures of each degree. \"If you are not already completely conversant in all the degrees heretofore conferred on you, remember, that an indulgence, prompted by a belief that you will apply yourself with double diligence to make yourself so, has induced the brethren to accept you. \"Let it, therefore, be your unremitting study to acquire such a degree of knowledge and information as shall enable you to discharge with propriety the various duties incumbent on you, and to preserve unsullied the title now conferred upon you of a Most Excellent Master.\" After this a motion is made by some of the members to close the Lodge. This motion being accepted and received, the Most Excellent says, \"B rother Junior Warden, you will please assemble the brethren around the altar for th e purpose of closing this Lodge of Most Excellent Masters.\" The brethren immediately assemble around the altar in a circle, and kneel on th e right knee, put their left arms over and join hands, as before; while kneeling in this pos ition, the Most Excellent reads the following Psalm: Psalm cxxxiv. \"Behold, bless ye the Lord, all ye servan ts of the Lord, which by night stand in the house of th e Lord. Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord. The Lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.\" The Most Excellent then closes the circle as in opening, when they balance six times, rise and balance six times more, disengaging their hands, and give all the signs downwar ds, and declares the Lodge closed. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. All legally constituted bodies of Royal Arch Masons are called Chapters, as regular bodies of Masons of the preceding degrees are called Lodges. All the degrees from Mark Master to Royal Arch are given under the sanction of Royal Arch Chapters. A person making application to a Chapter for admission, is understood as applying fo r all the degrees, unles s he states in his application the particular degree or degrees he wishes to receive. If you ask a Mark Master if he belongs to a Chapter, he will answer yes, but ha s only been marked. If a person make application for all the degrees, and wishes to re ceive them all at one time, he is frequently balloted for only on the Mark degree, it being understo od that if accepted on that, he is to receive the whole. The members of Chapters who have received all the de grees, style each other companions; if they have not received the Royal Arch degree, brothers. It is a point of the Royal Arch degree \"not to assist, or be present at the conferring of this degree upon more or less than three candidates at one time.\" If there are not three candidates present, one or two companions, as the case may be, volunteer to represent candidates, so as to make the requisite number, or a TEAM , as it is technically styled, and accompany the candidate or candidates through all the stages of exaltation. Every Chapter must consist of a High Priest, King, Scribe, [Pg 88] Captain of the Host, Principal Sojourner, Royal Arch Captain, three Grand Masters of the Veils, Treasur er, Secretary, and as many members as may be found convenient for working to advantage. In the Lodges for conferring the preparatory degrees, the High Priest presides as Master, the King as Se nior Warden, the Scribe as Junior Warden, the Captain of the Host as Marshal, or Master of Ceremonies, the Principal Sojourner as Senior Deacon, the Royal Arch Captain as Junior Deacon, the Master of the First, Second, and Third Veils as Junior, Senior, and Master Overseers; the Treasurer, S ecretary and Tyler as officers of corresponding rank. The Chapter is authorized to conf er the degrees by a charter, or warrant from some Grand Chapter. The members being assembled, the High Priest calls to order, and demands of the Royal Arch Captain if all present are Royal Arch Masons. Th e Royal Arch Captain as certains and answers in the affirmative. The High Priest then directs him to cause the Tyler to be stationed, which, being done, the High Priest says, \"Companions, Royal Arch Masons, you will please to clothe, and arrange yourselves for the purpose of opening the Ch apter.\" The furniture of the Chapter is then arranged, the companions clothed w ith scarlet sashes and aprons, and the officers invested with the proper insignia of their respective offices, and repa ir to their proper stations. The High Priest then demands whether the Chapter is tyled, and is answer ed the same as in the Lodge. The stations and duties of the officers are then recited (see Lecture, First Section). After the duties of the officers are recited, the High Priest directs the Captain of the Host to assemble the companions of the altar. The companions form a circle about the altar, all kn eeling on the right knee, w ith their arms crossed, right arm uppermost and hands joined, leaving a space for the High Priest, who reads the following passage of Scripture: 2 Thess. iii. 6-18. \"Now, we command you, brethren, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition that ye have received of us, for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us, for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you, neither did we eat any man's bread for nought, but wrought with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you; not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any man would not work, neither should he eat. For we hear that there are some, which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. Now them that are such, we command and exhort, that with quietness they work and eat their own bread. But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing. And if any man obey not our word, note that man and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. Now the Lord of peace Himself, give you peace always. The salutation of Paul, with mine own hand, which is the token, so I write.\" [The reader is requested to compare this with Scripture—he will observe that the name of the Savior is intentionally le ft out.] The High Priest th en takes his place in the circle. The whole circle then balance with their arms three times three, th at is, they raise their arms and let them fall upon their knees three times in concert, after a shor t pause three times more, and after another pause three times more. Then all break into squads of three and raise the living arch. This is done by each [Pg 89] companion taking his left wrist in his right hand, and with their le ft hands the three grasp each other's right wrists, and raise them above their heads. This constitutes the living arch, under which the Grand Omnific Royal Arch word must be given, but it must also be given by three times three. In opening the Chapter, this is done in the followi ng manner: After the three have joined hands they repeat these lines in concert, an d at the close of each line raise them above their heads and say, \"As we three did agree, the sacred word to keep, and as we three did agree, the sacred word to search, so we three do agree to raise this Royal Arch.\" At the close of the last line they keep their hands raised, while they incline their heads under them, a nd the first whispers in the ear of the second the syllable, J A H; the second to the third, B U H, a nd the third to the first, L U N. The second then commences, and it goes around again in the same manner, then the third, so that each companion pronounces each syllable of the word. [12] They then separate, each repa iring to his station, and the High Priest declares the Chapter opened. The Lecture of the Royal Arch degree is divided into two sections. The first section designates the appellation, number and station of the severa l officers, and points out the purpose and duties of their respective stations. Question—Are you a Royal Arch Mason? Answer— I AM T HAT , I AM . Q. How shall I know you to be a Royal Arch Mason? A. By three times three. Q. Where was you made a Royal Arch Mason? A. In a just and lawfully constituted Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, consisting of Most Excellent , High Priest, King and Sc ribe, Captain of the Host, Principal Sojourner, Royal Arch Captai n, and the three Grand Masters of the Veils, assembled in a room or place representing the tabe rnacle erected by our anci ent brethren near the ruins of King Solomon's Temple. Q. Where is the High Priest stati oned, and what are his duties? A. He is stationed in the sanctum sanctorum. His duty, with the King and Scribe, to s it in the Grand Council, to form plans and give directions to the workmen. Q. The King's station and duty? A. At the right ha nd of the High Priest, to aid him by his advice and council, and in his absence to preside. Q. The Scribe's station and duty? A. At the left hand of the Hi gh Priest, to assist him and the King in the discharge of their duties, and to preside in their absence. Q. The Captain of the Host's station and duty? A. At the right hand of the Grand Council, and to receive their orders and see them duly executed. Q. The Principal Sojourner's station and duty? A. At the left hand of the Grand Council, to bring the blind by a way that they know not, to [Pg 90] lead them in paths they have not known, to make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. Q. The Royal Arch Captain's station and duty? A. At the inner veil, or entrance of the sanctum sanctorium, to guard the same, and see that none pa ss but such as are duly qualified, and have the proper pass-words and signets of truth."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Q. What is the color of his banner? A. White, a nd is emblematical of that purity of heart and rectitude of conduct, which is essential to obt ain admission into the divine sanctum sanctorum above. Q. The stations and duties of the three Grand Ma sters of the Veils? A. At the entrance of their respective Veils: to guard the same , and see that none pass but such as are duly qualified and in possession of the proper pass-words and tokens. Q. What are the colors of their banners? A. That of the third, scarlet, which is emblematical of fervency and zeal, and the appropriate color of th e Royal Arch degree. It admonishes us to be fervent in the exercise of our devotions to God, and zealous in our endeavors to promote the happiness of men. Of the second, purple, whic h being produced by a due mixture of blue and scarlet, the former of which is the characteristic co lor of the symbolic, or th ree first degrees, and the latter, that of the Royal Arch degree, is an embl em of union, and is the characteristic color of the intermediate degrees. It teaches us to cultivate and improve that spirit of harmony between the brethren of the symbolic degrees and the compan ions of the sublime degrees, which should ever distinguish the members of a society founded upon the principles of everlast ing truth and universal philanthropy. Of the first, blue, the peculiar color of the three ancient or symbolical degrees. It is an emblem of universal friendship and benevolence, and instructs us that in the mind of a Mason those virtues should be as expansive as the blue arch of heaven itself. Q. The Treasurer's station and duty? A. At the ri ght hand of the Captain of the Host; his duty to keep a just and regular account of all the property and funds of the Chapter placed in his hands, and exhibit them to the Chapter when called upon for that purpose. Q. The Secretary's place in the Chapter? A. At the left of the Principa l Sojourner; his duty to issue the orders and notifications of his superior officers, record the proceedings of the Chapter proper to be written, to receive all moneys due to the Chapter, and pay them over to the Treasurer. Q. Tyler's place and duty? A. His station is at th e outer avenue of the Chapter, his duty to guard against the approach of cowans a nd eavesdroppers, and suffer none to pass or repass but such as are duly qualified. The second section describes the method of exaltation to this sublime degree as follows: \"Companion, you informed me, at the commencement of this Lecture, that you was made a Royal Arch Mason in a just and legally constituted Chapter of Royal Arch Masons.\" Q. Where was you prepared to be a Royal Arch Ma son? A. In a room adjacent to the Chapter. [Pg 91] Q. How was you prepared? A. In a company of three I was hoodwinked, with a cable-tow seven times around our bodies; in which condition we were conducted to the door of the Chapter and caused to give seven distinct knocks, which were answered by a like number fr om within, and we were asked \"Who comes there?\" Q. Your answer? A. Three brethren, who have b een regularly initiated as Entered Apprentices; passed to the degree of Fellow Craft; raised to th e sublime degree of Master Mason; advanced to the more honorable degree of Mark Master; presided as Masters in the chair; accepted and received as Most Excellent Masters, and now wish for furt her light in Masonry by be ing exalted to the more sublime degree of Royal Arch Masons. Q. What was then said to you? A. We were aske d if we were duly and truly prepared, worthy and well qualified; had made suitable proficiency in the preceding degrees, and were properly avouched for. All of which being answered in the affirmativ e, we were asked by what further right or benefit we expected to obtain this favor. Q. Your answer? A. By the benefit of a pass-word."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Q. Had you that pass-word? A. We had not, but our conductor gave it to us. Q. What was then said to you? A. We were dir ected to wait with patie nce till the Grand Council could be informed of our re quest and their pleasure known. Q. What answer was returned? A. Let them en ter under a living arch, and remember to stoop low, for he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. Q. Did you pass under a living arch? A. We did. Q. How were you then disposed of ? A. We were conducted to the al tar, caused to kneel, and take upon ourselves the solemn oath or obligation of a Royal Arch Mason. Q. Have you that obligation? A. I have. Q. Will you give it me? A. \"I, A. B., of my own free will and accord, in the presence of Almighty God, and this Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, erected to God, and dedicated to the Holy Order of St. John, do hereby and hereon, most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, in addition to my former obligations, that I will not give the degree of Royal Arch Mason to to anyone of an inferior degree, nor to any other being in the known world, except it be to a true and lawful companion Royal Arch Mason, or within the body of a just and legally constituted Chapter of such; and not unto him or unto them whom I shall hear so to be, but unto him or them only whom I shall find so to be, after strict trial, due examination, or legal information received. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not give the Grand Omnific Royal Arch word, which I shall hereafter receive, neither in the Chapter nor out of it, except there be present two companions, Royal Arch Masons, who, w ith myself, make three, and then by three times three, under a living arch, not above my breath. Furthermore, that I will not reveal the ineffable characters belonging to this degree, or retain the key to them in my possession, but destroy it whenever it comes to my sight. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not wrong this Chapter, nor a companion of this degree, to the value of anything, knowingly, myself, nor suffer it to be done by others, if in my power to prevent it. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not be at the [Pg 92] exaltation of a candidate to this degree, at a clandestine Chapter, I knowing it to be such. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not assist, or be present at the exaltation of a candidate to this degree, who has not regularly received the degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, Master Mason, Mark Master, Past Master, Most Excellent Master, to the best of my knowledge and belief. Furthermore, that I will not assist or see more or less than three candidates exalted at one and the same time. Furthermore, that I will not assist, or be present at the forming or opening of a Royal Arch Chapter, unless there be present nine regular Royal Arch Masons. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not speak evil of a companion Royal Arch Mason, neither behind his back nor before his face, but will apprise him of approaching danger, if in my power. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will not strike a companion Royal Arch Mason in anger, so as to draw his blood. Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will support the constitution of the General Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the United States of America, also the constitution of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the State under which this Chapter is held, and conform to all the by-laws, rules and regulations of this or any other Chapter of which I may hereafter become a member.

Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will aid and assist a companion Royal Arch Mason when engaged in any difficulty; and espouse his cause, so far as to extricate him from the same, if in my power , whether he be right or wrong.

So help me God, and keep me steadfast in the performance of the same.\" Q. After receiving the obligation, what was said to you? A. We were told that we were now obligated and received as Royal Arch Masons, but as this degree was infinitely more important than any of the preceding, it was necessary for us to pa ss through many trials, and to travel in rough and rugged ways to prove our fidelity, before we could be entrusted with the more import ant secrets of this degree. We were further told that, though we could not discover th e path we were to travel, we were under the direction of a faithful guide, w ho would \"bring the blind by a way they knew not, and lead them in paths they had not known; who would make da rkness light before them, and crooked [Pg 93] things straight; who would do these things, and not forsake them.\" (See Isa. xlii. 16.) Q. What followed? A. We were caused to tr avel three times around th e room, when we were again conducted to the alta r, caused to kneel, and attend to the following prayer: Supreme Architect of universal nature, who, by Thine Almighty Word, didst speak into being the stupendous arch of heaven! And for the instruction and pleasure of Thy rational creatures, didst adorn us with greater and lesser lights, thereby magni fying Thy power, and endearing Thy goodness unto the sons of men. We humbly adore and worship Thine unspeakable perfection! We bless Thee, that when man had fallen from his innocence and happiness, Thou didst leave him the powers of reasoning, and capacity of improvement and of pleasure. We thank Thee, that amidst the pains and calamities of our present state, so many means of refreshment and satisfaction are reserved to us while traveling the RUGGED PATH of life: especially would we, at this time, render Thee our thanksgiving and praise for the institution, as members of which we are, at this time, assembled, and for all the pleasures we have derived from it. We thank Thee, that the few here assembled before Thee, have been favored with new inducements, and been laid under new and stronger obligations of virtue and holiness. May these obligations, O Blessed Father! have their full effect upon us. Teach us, we pray Thee, the true reverence of Thy great, mighty, and terrible name. Inspire us with a firm and unshaken resolution in our virtuous pursuits. Give us grace diligently to search Thy word in the book of nature, wherein the duties of our high vocation are inculcated with divine authority. May the solemnity of the ceremonies of our institution be duly impressed on our minds, and have a happy and lasting effect on our lives! O Thou, who didst aforetime appear unto Thy servant Moses IN A FLAME OF FIRE OUT OF THE MIDST OF A BUSH , enkindle, we beseech Thee, in each of our hearts, a flame of devotion to Thee, of love to each other, and of charity to all mankind. May all Thy mi racles and mighty works fill us with Thy dread, and Thy goodness impress us with the love of Thy holy name. May HOLINESS TO THE L ORD be engraven upon all our thoughts, words, and actions. May the incense of piety ascend continually unto Thee from the altar of our hearts, and burn day and night, as a sacrifice of sweet-smelling savor, well pleasing unto Thee. And since sin has destroyed within us the first temple of purity and innocence, may Thy heavenly grace guide and assist us in rebuilding a SECOND TEMPLE of reformation, and may the glory of this latter house be greater than the glory of the former! Amen. So mote it be."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Q. After the prayer what follo wed? A. We were again caused to travel thr ee times around the room, during which the following passage of Scripture was read, and we were shown a representation of the bush that burned and was not consumed: Exodus iii. 1-6. \"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush, and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. And He said Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid hi s face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\" Q. What followed? A. We again travel ed, while the following passage was read: 2 Chron xxxvi. 11-20. \"Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when [Pg 94] he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did THAT WHICH WAS evil in the sight of the Lord, his God, AND humbled not himself before Jeremiah, the prophet, SPEAKING from the mouth of the Lord. And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, and he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel. Moreover, all the chiefs of the priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen: and polluted the house of the Lord which He had hallowed in Jerusalem. And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by His messengers, rising up betimes and sending; because He had compassion on His people, and on His dwelling place. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and misused His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people, till THERE WAS no remedy. Therefore he brought upon him the King of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young men or maidens, old men, or him that stooped for age; he gave them all unto his hand. And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and treasures of the king, and of his princes; all THESE he brought to Babylon. And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and hi s sons, until the reign of the kingdom of Persia.\" At the close of this there was a represen tation of the destruc tion of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and the carrying captive of the ch ildren of Israel to Babylon. We were seized, bound in chains, and confined in a dungeon. Q. What followed? A. We heard rejoicing, as of good news; the proclama tion of Cyrus, King of Persia, was read in our hearing. Ezra i. 1-3. \"Now in the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, King of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, Thus saith Cyrus, King of Persia, the Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He hath charged me to build Him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? His God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, which is in Jerusalem.\" Q. What was then said to you? A. We were unbound and requested to go up to Jerusalem to assist in rebuilding the Temple, but objected, as we had no pass by which to make ourselves known to our brethren. Q. What followed? A. The third chapter of Exodus, 13th and 14th verses , were read to us:"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"\"And Moses said unto God, Behold! when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, the God of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall say to me, what is his name? What shall I say to them? And God said unto Moses, I AM , THAT I AM . And thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.\" We were directed to use the words, \" I AM , THAT I AM \" as a pass-word. Q. What followed? A. We arose to go up to Jeru salem, and traveled over hills and valleys, rough and rugged ways, for many days; during which time, as we stopped occasionally, to rest and refresh ourselves, the following passages from the Psalms we re read in our hearing for our consolation and encouragement [Psalms cxli, cxlii, cxliii]: Psalm cxli. \"Lord, I cry unto Thee; Make haste unto me; give ear [Pg 95] unto my voice. Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense, and the lifting up of hands as the evening sacrifice. Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity. Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness: and let Him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil. Mine eyes are unto Thee, O God the Lord; in Thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute. Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while that I withal escape. Psalm cxlii. I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication. I poured out my complaint before him; I showed before him my trouble. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for me. I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me; refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. I cried unto Thee, O Lord; I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise Thy name. Psalm cxliii. Hear my prayer, O Lord; give ear to my supplications; in Thy faithfulness answer me, and in Thy righteousness. And enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified. For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath made me to dwell in darkness. Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit faileth; hide not Thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. Cause me to hear Thy loving kindness in the morning; for in Thee do I trust; cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for I lift up my soul unto Thee. Bring my soul out of trouble, and of Thy mercy cut off mine enemies; for I am Thy servant.\" At length we arrived at Jerusale m, and presented ourselves at the first Veil of the Tabernacle. Q. What was there said to you? A. The Master of the first Veil demanded of us, \"Who comes there? Who dares approach this outer Veil of our sacred Tabernacle? Who comes here?\" Q. Your answer? A. Three weary travelers fr om Babylon. They then demanded of us who we were, and what were our intentions. Q. Your answer? A. We are your own brethren a nd kindred of the tribe of Benjamin; we are the descendants of those noble families of Giblemites, who wrought so hard at the building of the first temple, were present at its destruction by Ne buchadnezzar, by him carried away captive to Babylon, where we remained servants to him and his sons till the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, by whose order we were liberated, and are now returned to assist in rebuilding the house of the Lord, without expectation of fee or reward."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Q. What further was demanded, of you? A. The pa ss-word, \"I am, that I am.\" After giving which, the Master of the Veil, assured of his full conf idence in us as worthy brethren, commended us for our zeal and gave us the token and words to enable us to pass the second Veil. Q. What are they? A. The token is an imitation of that which Moses was commanded to exhibit to the children of Israel, casting his rod upon th e ground it became a serpent, and putting forth his hand and taking it again by the tail, it became a rod in his hand. The words are these, \" S HEM , H AM , and J APHETH .\" [Pg 96] Q. What followed? A. We we re conducted to the second Veil, where the same questions were asked, and answers returned as before, with the addition of th e pass-words and token given at the first Veil. Q. What followed? A. The Master of the second Veil told us that we mu st be true and lawful brethren to pass thus far, but further we co uld not go without his pa ss and token, which he accordingly gave to us. Q. What are they? A. The words are S HEM , J APHETH , and A DONIRAM ; the token is putting the hand in the bosom, plucking it out again, in imita tion of the second sign wh ich Moses was directed to make to the Israelites, when putting his hand into his bosom and taking it out again, it became leprous as snow. Q. How were you then disposed of? A. We were conducted onwards to the third Veil, when the same questions were asked, and an swers returned as before, with the addition of the token and words last received. Q. What followed? A. The Master of the third Ve il then gave us the sign, words, and signet, to enable us to pass the fourth Veil, to the presence of the Grand Council. Q. What are the words, sign, and signet? A. The words are J APHETH , S HEM , N OAH ; the sign, pouring water upon the ground, in imitation of Mo ses, who poured water upon the ground and it became blood; the signet is called the signet of trut h, and is Zerrubbabel. It alludes to this passage, \"In that day I will take thee, O Zerrubbabel, my serv ant, the son of Shealtiel, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee.\" [See Haggai, chap. ii. ver. 23.] Q. What followed? A. We then passed to the fourth Veil, where, after answering the same questions, and giving the sign, words, and signet last received, we were admitted to the presence of the Grand Council, where the High Priest made the same demands as were made at the Veils, and received the same answers. Q. What did the High Priest further demand of you? A. The si gns from Entered Apprentice to Most Excellent Master in succession. Q. What did he then say to you? A. He said we were truly three worthy Most Excellent Masters, commended us for our zeal and disi nterestedness, and aske d what part of the work we were willing to undertake. Q. Your answer? A. That we were willing to undertake any service, however servile or dangerous, for the sake of forwardi ng so great and noble an undertaking. Q. What followed? A. We were then furnishe d with a pick-axe, spade and crow, and were directed to repair to the northwest corner of the ruins of the old temple and commence removing the rubbish, to lay the foundation of the new, and to observe and preserve everything of importance and report to the Grand Council. We accordingly re paired to the place, a nd after laboring several days, we discovered what seemed a rock, but on striking it with the crow , it gave a hollow sound, and upon closer examination, we discovered in it an iron ring, by help of which we succeeded in removing it from its place, when we found it [Pg 97] to be the keystone of an arch, and through the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"aperture there appeared to be an immense vau lt curiously arched. We then took the stone and repaired to the Grand Council, a nd presented it for their inspection. Q. What did the Grand Council then say to you? A. They told us that the stone contained the mark of our ancient Grand Master, Hiram Abiff; th at it was truly a fortuna te discovery, and that without doubt the vault contained things of the utmost consequence to the craft. They then directed us to repair again to the pl ace and continue our researches. Q. What followed? A. We returned again to th e place and agreed that one of our number should descend by means of a rope, th e middle of which was fixed firmly around his body, and if he wished to descend, he was to pull the rope in hi s right hand, if to ascend, that in his left. He accordingly descended, and in groping about, he found what appeared to be some ancient jewels, but the air becoming offensive, he pulled the rope in his left hand, and was immediately drawn out. We then repaired to the Grand Council, made our report, and presented the articles found, which they pronounced the jewels of our three ancient Grand Masters, Solomon, Hiram, and Hiram Abiff. They commended us highly for our zeal and fidelit y, assured us that it was a fortunate discovery, that it would probably lead to st ill more important ones, and that our disinterested perseverance should not go unrewarded. They directed us to repa ir again to the place, and make what further discoveries lay in our power. Q. What followed? A. We again returned to th e place, and let down one of our companions as before. The sun having now reached its meridian hei ght, darted its rays to the inmost recesses of the vault, and enabled him to discover a small ches t or box, curiously wrough t; but the ai r becoming exceedingly offensive, he gave the sign, and was immediately drawn out. We immediately repaired to the Grand Council and presented our discov ery. On examination, the Grand Council pronounced it to be the ARK OF THE COVENANT , which was deposited in the vau lt by our ancient Grand Master for safe keeping. On inspecting it more closely, they found a key with which they opened it. The High Priest then took from it a book, wh ich he opened, and read as follows: Gen. i. 1-3. \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep ; and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.\" Deut. xxxi. 24-26. \"And it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finish ed, that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying, Take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.\" Ex. xxv. 21. \"And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above, upon the ark, and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.\" He then declared it to be the book of the law upon which the Grand Council, in an ecstasy of joy, exclaimed three times, \"Long lost, now found, holiness to the Lord;\" at the same time drawing their hands across their foreheads. [Pg 98] Q. What further was found in the ark? A. A small vessel containing a substance, which, after the Council had examined, a nd the High Priest again read fr om the book of the law, Ex. xvi. 32-34, he pronounced to be manna: \"And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded; fill an omer of the manna to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord to be kept for your generations. As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the testimony, to be kept for a token.\""},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The High Priest then took a rod from the ark, which, after he had read the following passage, Numb. xvii. 10. \"And the Lord said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token.\" He pronounced to be Aaron's rod, which budded and blossomed as the rose. Q. Was there anything further found in the ark? A. There was a key to the ineffable characters belonging to this degree, as follows beginning at top of this diagram at the left hand angle. The upper left angle without a dot is A, the same with a dot is B, etc. Q. What further was said to you? A. Th e High Priest read the following passage: Exodus vi. 2, 3. \"And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord, and I appealed unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.\" He then informed us that the name of Deity, th e divine Logos, or word, to which reference is made in John i. 1-5. \"In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, the same was in the beginning with God, all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.\" That this Logos or word was anci ently written only in th ese sacred characters, and thus preserved from one generation to another. That this was the true Masonic word, which wa s lost in the death of Hiram Abiff, and was restored at the rebuilding of the temple, in the manner we had at that time assisted to represent. Q. What followed? A. We were reminded of th e manner in which we were sworn to give the Royal Arch word, were instructed in the manner, a nd finally invested with th e all important word in due form. Q. What is the Grand Royal Arch word? A. JAH BUH LUN. Q. How is it to be given? A. Under a living arch by three times three, in low breath (see description of opening a Chapter). [Pg 99] Q. What followed? A. We were presented with the signs belongi ng to this degree. Q. Will you give me those signs? Answered by gi ving the signs thus: Raise the right hand to the forehead, the hand and arm horizontal; thumb towa rds the forehead, draw it briskly across the forehead, and drop it perpendicularl y by the side. This constitutes th e due-guard of this degree, and refers to the penalty of the obligation. The grand sign is made by locking the fingers of both hands together, and carrying them to the top of the he ad, the palms upward, alluding to the manner in which the brother who descended into the vaul t and found the ark, found his hands involuntarily placed to protect his head from th e potent rays of the meridian sun."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Q. What followed. A. The High Priest then placed crowns upon our heads, and told us that we were now invested with all the important secrets of this degree, and crowned and received as worthy companions, Royal Arch Masons. He then gives the charge. The second section of the Lecture on this degree states minutely the ceremonies and forms of exaltation (as the conferring of this degree is st yled), but there seems to be some parts which require explanation. The Principal Sojourner c onducts the candidate, and is considered as representing Moses conducting the children of Israel through the wi lderness. He is usually dressed to represent an old man, bowed with age, wi th a mask on his face, and long beard hanging down upon his breast; is introduced to the candidate in the pr eparation room by the name of Moses. On entering the Chapter, the candida tes are received under a \"living ar ch;\" that is, the companions arrange themselves in a line on each side of the door, and each joins hands with the one opposite to himself. The candidates entering, th e conductor says, \"Stoop low, brothers! we are about to enter the arches; remember that he th at humbleth himself shall be ex alted; stoop low, brothers, stoop low!\" The candidates seldom pass the first pair of hands, or, in other words, the first arch, without being so far humbled as to be very glad to supp ort themselves on all fours. Their progress may be imagined to be very slow; for, in addition to their humble posture, they are obliged to support on their backs the whole weight of the living arches above. The conduc tor, to encourage them, calls out occasionally, \"Stoop low, brothers , stoop low!\" If they go too slow to suit the companions, it is not unusual for some one to apply a sharp point to their bodies to urge them on; the points of the pasteboard crown answer quite well for this pu rpose. After they have endured this humiliating exercise as long as suits the convenience of the companions, they pass fro m under the living arches. The candidates next receive the obl igation, travel the room, attend th e prayer, travel again, and are shown a representation of the Lord appearing to Moses from the bur ning bush. This last is done in various ways. Sometimes an earthen pot is filled with earth, and green bu shes set around the edge of it, and a candle in the centre; and sometimes a stool is provided with holes about the edge, in which bushes are placed, and a bundle of rags or tow, saturated with oil of tu rpentine, placed in the centre, to which fire is communicated. Sometimes a [Pg 100] large bush is suspended from the ceiling, around the stem of which tow is wound wet with o il of turpentine. In whatever way the bush is prepared, when the words are read, \"He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire,\" etc., the bandage is removed from the eyes of the can didates, and they see the fire in the bush, [15] and, at the words, \"Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes,\" et c., the shoes of the candidates are taken off, and they remain in the same situation while the rest of the passage is read to the words, \"And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\" The bandage is th en replaced, and the candidates again travel about the room, while the next passag e of Scripture is read. [See Lecture.] At the words, \"And break down the walls of Jerusalem,\" the companions make a tremendous crashing and noise, by firing pistols, ove rturning chairs, benches, and whatev er is at hand; rolling cannon balls across the floor, stamping, etc., etc., and in the midst of the uproar the candidates are seized, a chain thrown about them, and they are hurried away to the preparation room. This is the representation of the destruction of Jerusalem, and carrying captive the children of Israel to Babylon. After a short time the proclamation of Cyrus is read, the candidates are unbound, and start to go to Jerusalem, to assist in rebuilding the temple. The candi dates, still hoodwinked, are brought into the Chapter, and commence their journey over the rugged and rough path s. They are literally rough paths, sticks of timber framed across the pa th the candidate must travel, some inches from the floor, make no comfortable traveling for a pers on blindfolded. But this is not always the way it is prepared; billets of wood singly, or in heaps, ladders, nets of cord, et c., etc., are all put in requisition to form the rough and rugged path s, which are intended as a trial of the FIDELITY of the candidates. If they escape with nothing more than bruised shin s they do well. They have been known to faint away under the severity of the discipline, and occasion the WORTHY companions much alarm. After traveling the rugg ed paths till all are satisfied, they arrive at the first Veil of the Tabernacle, give the pass-word, and pass on to th e second, give the pass-words, and present the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"sign. This, it will be recollected, is in imitation of the sign which Moses was directed to make to the children of Israel. He threw his rod upon the gro und and it became a serpent; he put forth his hand and took it by the tail, and it became a rod in his hand. The conductor is provided with a rod, made in the form of a snake, and painted to resemble one. This he drops upon the floor, and takes it up again. They then pass on to the ne xt Veil, give the pass-word and ma ke the sign (put the right hand in the bosom and pluck it out agai n); pass on to the next, give th e pass-words and make the sign (pour water upon the ground), and are [Pg 101] ushered into the presence of the G RAND C OUNCIL . The Veils are four in number, and of the same color as the banners of the three Grand Masters of the Veils, and that of the Royal Arch Captain, blue , purple, scarlet and white, and have the same references and explanations. [See Lecture.] The Gr and Council consists of the Most Excellent High Priest, King and Scribe. The High Pr iest is dressed in a white robe, with a breastplate of cut-glass, consisting of twelve pieces, to repr esent the twelve tribes of Israel ; an apron, and a mitre. The King wears a scarlet robe, apron, and crown. The mitre and crown are generally made of pasteboard: sometimes they have them of the most splendid ma terials, gold and silk ve lvet; but these are kept for public occasions. The mitre has the words, \" H OLINESS TO THE L ORD \" in gold letters across the forehead. The Scribe wears a purple robe, apr on, and turban. After havi ng satisfied the Grand Council that they are true brethr en, and stated their object in co ming to Jerusalem, the candidates are directed to commence the labor of removing the rubbish of the old temple preparatory to laying the foundation of the new. For the purpose of perfor ming this part of the ceremony, there is in or near the Chapter a na rrow kind of closet, the only entrance to which is through a sc uttle at the top; there is placed over this scuttle whatever rubbish is at hand, bits of board, brick bats, etc., and among them the keystone. After the candidates are fu rnished with the tools (pick-axe, spade, and crow), they are directed to this place, and remo ve the rubbish till they discover the keystone. This they convey to the Grand Council, as stated in th e Lecture. After the Gra nd Council have examined it, they pronounce it to be the work of the Grand Ma ster, Hiram Abiff, and dire ct them to return and prosecute their researches, not doubting that they will make many important discoveries. The candidates return and let down one of their number by a rope; he finds three squares, is drawn out, and all proceed with them to the Grand Counc il. The Grand Council inspect them, and pronounce them to be the three ancient jewels that belong ed to the three ancient Grand Masters, Solomon, Hiram and Hiram Abiff. The candidates then retu rn to the vault and let down another of their number. Here, let it be remarked, some Chapters, for the purpose of light ening the labor of the candidates, call in the aid of m achinery. A pulley is suspended over the vault, and the candidate is EXALTED from the bottom at the tail of a snatch bloc k; the one last let dow n find at the bottom a small chest or box, upon which he gi ves the signal to be drawn out; he no sooner discovers the box than the air in the vault, in the language of the Lecture, \"becomes exceedingly offensive.\" This is strictly true; for at the moment he takes up the box and is preparing to ascend, fire is communicated to a quantity of gunpowder at his feet, so that by the time he arrives at the top, he is so completely suffocated with the fumes of the powder, that he is almost deprived of the power of respiration or motion. The box is carried to the Gr and Council and pronounced to be the ark of the covenant. It is opened, and a Bible taken out, and some passages read from it. [See Lecture.] One word respecting the representation of the ark. It ought to be a splendid box covered with gold, a nd some of them are really elegant; but the Chapter must [Pg 102] have such as it can afford; if it is too poor to procure splendid furniture, cheap articles are made to answer; for an ark, if the funds are low, a plain cherry or pine box will answer, and sometimes a cigar box is made the humble representation of the splendid ark, made by divine command, of shitti m wood, and overlaid with pure gold. The High Priest takes then from the ark a vessel containing something to re present manna. This vessel is of various forms and materials, from an elegant silv er urn to a broken earthen mug; and the substance contained is as various as the vessels in which it is deposited; such as a bit of sugar, a piece of cracker, or a few kernels of wheat. Whichever is us ed, the High Priest takes it out and gravely asks the King and Scribe their opinion of it; they say they think it is manna. The High Priest then looks"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"at it intently and says, \"I t looks like manna;\" smells it and says, \"It smells like manna;\" and then tastes it and says, \"It is manna.\" The High Priest then takes from the ark a bit of an apple tree sprout, a few inches long, with some withered buds upon it, or a stick of a similar length, with some artificial buds upon it, which, after consulting with the King and Scribe, he pronounces Aaron's rod. He then takes out the key to the ineffable characters and explains it. This key is kept in the ark on four distinct pieces of paper. The key is marked on a square piece of paper, and the paper is then divided into four equal parts, thus: The outside lines represent the dimensions of the paper; the inside ones are the key, and the dotted ones, the section that is made of the whole for the purpose of keeping it secret, should any GRACELESS COWAN ever get possession of the sacred ark, and attempt to rummage its contents. The other part of the key x is made on the back of the same piece of paper, so that on putting them together, it shows equally plain. It is said that these characters were used by Aaron Burr, in carrying on his treasonable practices, a nd by that means made public; since which time they have been written a nd read from left to right. After th e ceremonies are ended, the High Priest informs the candidates, in many or few words, acco rding to his ability, that this degree owes its origin to Zerrubbabel and his asso ciates, who rebuilt the temple by order of Cyrus, King of Persia. He informs them that the discovery of the secret vault and the inestimable treasures, with the long lost WORD , actually took place in the manner represented in conferring this degree, and that it is the circumstance upon which the degree is principall y founded. The ceremony of closing a Chapter is precisely the same as at opening, to the raising of the living arch. The co mpanions join hands by threes, in the same manner, and say in concert, \"A s we three did agree the sacred word to keep, as we three did agree the sacred word to search, so we three do agree to close this royal arch.\" They then break without giving the word, as th e High Priest reads the following prayer: \"By the wisdom of the Supreme High Priest may we be directed, by His strength may we be enabled, and by the beauty of virtue may we be incited to perform the obligations here enjoined upon us; to keep inviolable the mysteries here unfolded to us, and invariably to practice all [Pg 103] those duties out of the Chapter, which are inculcated in it. (Response.) So mote it be. Amen.\" The High Priest then declares th e Chapter closed in due form. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"KNIGHTS OF THE RED CROSS.

What was said to you from within? A. Who comes there? Q. Your answer? A. Companion A. B., who has re gularly received the seve ral degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, Master Mason, Mark Ma ster, Past Master, Most Excellent Master, and Royal Arch, and now solicits the honor of being regularly constituted a Knight of the Red Cross. Q. What was then said to you? A. I was asked if it was of my own free will and accord that I made this request; if I was worthy and well qua lified; if I had made suitable proficiency in the foregoing degrees, and was properly vouched for; all of which being answered in the affirmative, I was asked by what further right or benefit I expected to gain admittance. Q. Your answer? A. By the benefit of a pass-word. Q. Did you give that pass-word? A. I did, with the assistance of my comp anions. [Here the Royal Arch word is given as descri bed in the Royal Arch degree.] Q. What was then said to you? A. I was then directed to wait with patience till the Most Excellent Prelate should be informed of my request, and his answer returned. Q. What was his answer? A. Let him be admitted. Q. What was you then informed? A. The Most Ex cellent Prelate observed that the Council there assembled represented the Grand C ouncil convened at Jerusalem, in the second year of the reign of Darius, King of Persia, to deliberate on the unha ppy state of the fraternity during the reigns of Artaxerxes and Ahasuerus, and to devise some m eans to obtain favor of th e new Sovereign, and to gain his consent to proceed in re building their new city and temple.

Our Most Excellent and faithful companion, Zerrubbabel, who was formerly honored w ith the favorable notice and friendship of the Sovereign, now offers his serv ices to encounter the hazardous enterpri se of traversing [Pg 107] the Persian dominions, and seeking admission to th e presence of the Sovereign, where the first favorable moment will be seized to remind th e King of his vow, and impress on his mind the almighty force and importance of truth; and from his known piety no doubt can be entertained of gaining his consent, that our enemies be removed far hence, and that we be no longer hindered or impeded in our noble and glorious undertaking."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Q.

Did you consent to that obligation? A. I did, in due form. Q. What was that due form? A. Kneeling on my left knee, my right foot forming a square, my body erect, my right hand grasping the hilt of my sword, my left hand covering the Holy Bible, Square, and Compass, with two cross-swords thereon, in which due form I took upon me the solemn oath and obligation of Knight of the Red Cross.

Q. What followed? A. After remonstrating in vain against their violations, I told them I was a prince of the house of Judah, and demanded an audience with their sovereign. Q. What was the answer? A. You are a prisoner, and can obtain an audience with the sovereign only in the garb of a captive and slave. Q. Did you consent to this? A. I did; being fi rmly persuaded that could I by any means gain access to the presence of the sovereign, I should be able to accomplish the object of my mission. Q. What followed? A. They then deprived me of my outward appare l, sash and sword, and having confined my hands and feet in chains, the links thereof were of a triangular form, they put sackcloth and ashes on my head. Q. Why were the links of the captive's chain of a triangular form? A. The Assyrians having learned that among the Jews the triangle was an em blem of the Eternal, cau sed the links of their chain to be made of a triangular form, thinking thereby to add to the miseries of their captives. [Pg 109] Q. What followed? A. I was conducted to the door of the Council chamber, where the alarm being given by 4 × 2, the Warder a ppeared and demanded, \"Who comes there?\" Q.

I was asked from whence I came. Q. Your answer? A. From Jerusalem. Q. What was then demanded of you? A. Who are you? Q. Your answer? A. The first among my equals , a Mason, and free by rank, but a captive and slave by misfortune. Q. What was you then asked? A. My name. Q. Your answer? A. Zerrubbabel. Q. What were you then asked? A. What are your demands? Q. Your answer? A. To see the sovereign, if possible. Q. What was then said to you? A.

My engagements are sacred and inviolable : I cannot reveal our se crets. If I can obtain your majesty's favor only at the expense of my in tegrity, I humbly beg leave to decline your royal protection, and will cheerfully s ubmit to any honorable exile. Q. What was the Sovereign's reply? A. Zerr ubbabel, your virtue and integrity are truly commendable, and your fidelity to your engagements is worthy of imitation; from this moment you are free—my guards will divest you of those chains and that garb of slavery, and clothe you in suitable habiliments to attend me at the banquet hall. Zerrubbabel, you are free; guards, strike off those chains; and may those emblems of slavery ne ver again disgrace the hands of a Mason, more particularly a prince of the house of Judah; Ze rrubbabel, we assign you a seat of rank and honor among the princes and rulers of our assembly.

He then ordered th e guards to attend him to the banquet hall. Q. What occurred there? A. After having particip ated in a liberal entert ainment, the Sovereign Master not being inclined to sl eep, and many of the guard having retired, he amused himself by entering into conversation with some of his pr incipal officers and friends, proposing certain questions to them, and offering a princely reward to such as s hould give the most reasonable and satisfactory answer."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Q.

Furthermore do I promise and sw ear, that I will not assist or be present at the forming and opening of an Encampment of Knight Templars, unless there be present seven Knights of the Order, or the representatives of three differe nt Encampments, acting under the sanction of a legal warrant.

Furthermore do I promise and swear, that I will support and maintain the by-laws of the Encampment, of which I may hereafter become a member, the edicts and regulations of the Grand Encampment, under which the same may be holden, together with the laws and constitution of the General Grand Encampment of the United States of America, so far as the same shall come to my knowledge. To all this I most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with a firm and steady resolution to perform and keep the same, without any hesitation, equivocation, mental reservation, or self-evasion of mind in me whatever, binding myself under no less penalty than to have my head struck off and placed on the highest spire in Christendom, should I knowingly or wilfully violate any part of this my solemn obligation of a Knight Templar; so help me God, and keep me steadfast to perform and keep the same.\" Q. What followed? A. The Most Excellent Prelate directed me to arise, and thus addressed me: \"Pilgrim, thou hast craved permission to pass through our solemn ceremonies, and enter the asylum of our Encampment; by thy sandals, scrip, and staff, I judge thee to be a ch ild of humility; charity and hospitality are the grand characteristics of this magnanimous Order; in the characters of Knight Templars, you are bound to give alms to poor and wear y pilgrims, traveling from afar; to succor the needy, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and bind up the wounds of the afflicted. We here wage war against the enemies of innocent virgins, destitute widows, helpless [Pg 116] orphans, and the Christian religion. If thou art desirous of enlisting in this noble and glorious warfare, lay aside thy staff and take up the sword, fighting manfully t hy way, and with valor running thy course; and may the Almighty, who is a strong tower and defence to all those who put their trust and confidence in him, be now and ever thy defence and thy salvation.\" Q. What followed? A. Having laid aside my st aff and taken up the sword, the Most Excellent Prelate continued: \"Having now taken up the sword, we expect you will ma ke a public declaration of the cause in which you will wield it.\" Q. Your answer? A. I wield my sword in defen ce of innocent virgins, destitute widows, helpless orphans, and the Christian religion. Q. What was the Prelate's reply? A. With conf idence in this profession, our Senior Warden will invest you with the warrior's pass, and under his dir ection, as a trial of your courage and constancy,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"we must now assign you seven years of warfare— success and victory attend you. (The pass-word is Mahershalal-hashbaz, and is given under the arch of steel , as has been described.) Q. What followed? A. I then commenced my tour of warfare, and made professions of the cause in which I would wield my sword. Q. Where did your tour of warfare end? A. At th e door of the asylum, wher e, on giving the alarm by 3 × 4, the Warder appeared and demanded, \"Who comes there?\" Q. Your reply? A. A pilgrim warrior, travelin g from afar, who, having passed full three long years of warfare, is most desirous now, if it s hould please the Grand Commander, to be admitted to the honors and rewards that await a valiant Templar. Q. What was then demanded of you? A. What su rety can you give that you are no impostor? Q. Your answer? A. The commendation of a true and courteous Knight, the Senior Warden, who recommends to the Grand Commander the remissi on of the four remaining years of warfare. Q. What was then demanded? A. By what fu rther right or benefit do you expect to gain admittance to the asylum? Q. Your answer? A. By the benefit of a pass-word. Q. Give it. (Here the warrior's pa ss is given, as before described.) Q. What was then said to you? A. I was directed to wait with courage and constancy, and soon an answer would be returned to my request. Q. What answer was returned? A. Let him be admitted. Q. What did the Grand Commande r then observe? A. Pilgrim, having gained admittance to our asylum, what profession have you now to make in testimony of your fitness to be received a Knight among our number. Q. Your answer? A. Most Eminen t, I now declare, in truth and soberness, that I hold no enmity or hatred against a being on earth, that I woul d not freely reconcile, should I find him in a corresponding disposition. Q. What was the Grand Commander' s reply? A. Pilgrim, the sentiments you utter are worthy of the cause in which you are engaged; but [Pg 117] still we must require some stronger proofs of your faithfulness; the proofs we demand are, that you par ticipate with us in five libations; this being accomplished, we will receive you a Knight among our number. Q. What were the ingredients of the libations? A. Four of them were taken in wine and water, and the fifth in pure wine. Q. What was the first libation? A. To the memory of Solomon, King of Israel. Q. What was the second libation? A. To the memory of Hiram, King of Tyre. Q. What was the third? A. To the memory of Hi ram, the widow's son, who lost his life in defence of his integrity. Q. What followed? A. The Grand Commander then addressed me: \"Pilgrim, the Order to which you seek to unite yourself is founded on the Christia n religion; let us, then, attend to a lesson from the holy evangelist.\" Q. What followed? A. The Most Excellent Prelate then read a lesson relative to the apostasy of Judas Iscariot. (See Templar's Chart.) Q. What followed? A. The Grand Commander then addressed me: \"Pilgrim, the twelve tapers you see around the triangle, correspo nd in number with the disciples of our Saviour while on earth,"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"one of whom fell by transgression, and betrayed hi s Lord and Master; and as a constant admonition to you always to persevere in th e paths of honor, integrity, and trut h, and as a perpetual memorial of the apostasy of Judas Iscariot , you are required by th e rules of our Order to extinguish one of those tapers; and let it ever remind you that he who can basely violate his vow and betray his secret, is worthy of no better fate than J udas Iscariot.\" (The candidate ex tinguishes one of the tapers; the triangle is placed in the centre of the room, on which are twelve burning candles; between each candle stick a glass of wine; in the centre of th e triangle is placed a coffin, on which are the Bible, skull and cross-bones.) Q. What followed? A. The relics were then uncovered, and the Grand Commander thus addressed me: \"Pilgrim, you here behold an emblem of mortality resting on divinity—a human skull resting on the Holy Scriptures ; it is to teach us that among a ll the trials and vicissitudes which we are destined to endure while passing through th e pilgrimage of this life, a firm reliance on divine protection can alone afford us the consol ation and satisfaction which the world can neither give nor take away.\" Q. What followed? A. The Most Excellent Prelate then read a lesson to me with respect to the bitter cup. Q. What followed? A. The Gr and Commander took the skull in his hand, and pronounced the following soliloquy: \"How striking is this emblem of mortality, on ce animated, like us, but now it ceases to act or think; its vital energies are ex tinct, and all the powers of life have ceased their operations; and such, my brethren, is the state to which we are all hastening; let us, therefore, gratefully improve the remaining space of life, that when our weak and frail bodies, like this memento, shall become cold and inanimate and [Pg 118] mouldering in sepulchra l dust and ruins, our disembodied spirits may soar aloft to the ble ssed regions, where dwell light and life eternal.\" Q. What followed? A. The Most Excellent Prelate then read a lesson relativ e to the crucifixion. (See Templar's Chart.) Q. What was the fourth libation? A. To the me mory of Simon of Cyre ne, the early friend and disciple of our Saviour, who was compelled to b ear his cross, and fell a martyr to his fate. Q. What followed? A. The Grand Commander th en addressed me: \"Pilgrim, before you can be permitted to participate in the fifth libation, we mu st enjoin on you one year's penance as a trial of your faith and humility, which you will perform unde r the direction of the Junior and Senior Wardens, with the skull in one hand, and a lighted ta per in the other; which is to teach you that with faith and humility you should cause your light so to shine before men, that they, seeing your good works, may glorify our Father, which is in heaven.\" Q. What followed? A. I then commenced my tour of penance, and passed in an humble posture through the sepulchre, where the fifth lesson was r ead by the Senior Warden relative to the resurrection. (Here the ascension of the Saviour is represented on canvas, which the candidate is directed to look at: at the same time the Sir Knights sing a hymn.) After the hymn, the Prelate speaks as follows: \"I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord; he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he be made alive; and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Pilgrim, the scene before you represents the splendid conclusion of the hallowed sacrifice offered by the Redeemer of the world, to propitiate the anger of an offended Deity. This sacred volume informs us that our Saviour, after having suffered the pains of death, descended into the place of departed spirits, and that on the third day he burst the bands of death, triumphed over the grave, and, in due time, ascended with transcendent majesty to heaven, where he now sits on the right hand of our Heavenly Father, a mediator and intercessor for all those who have faith in Him. I now invest you with an emblem of that faith (at"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"the same time suspends from his neck a black cross): it is also an emblem of our Order, which you will wear as a constant memorial, for you to imitate the virtues of the immaculate Jesus, who died that you might live. Pilgrim, the ceremonies in which you are now engaged are calculated deeply to impress your mind, and I trust will have a happy and lasting effect upon your character. You were first, as a trial of your faith and humility, enjoined to perform se ven years of pilgrimage; it represents the great pilgrimage of life, through which we are all passing; we are all weary pilgrims, anxiously looking forward to that asylum, where we shall rest from our labors, and be at rest forever. You were then directed, as a trial of your courage and constancy, to perform seven years' warfare; it represents to you the constant warfare with the lying vanities and deceits of this world, in which it is necessary for us always to be engaged. You are now performing a pena nce as a trial of your humility. Of this our Lord and Saviour has left us a bright example. For though he was the Eternal Son of God, he humbled himself to be born of a woman, to endure the pains and afflictions incident to human nature, and finally to suffer a cruel and ignominious death upon the cross; it is also a trial of that faith which will conduct you safely over the dark gulf of everlasting death, and land your enfranchised spirit in the peaceful abodes of the blessed. Pilgrim, keep ever in your memory this awful truth; you know not how soon you may be called upon to render an account to that Supreme Judge, from whom not even the most minute action of your life is hidden; for although you now stand erect in all the strength [Pg 119] of manhood and pride of beauty, in a few short moments you may become a pale and lifeless corpse. This moment, even while I yet speak, the angel of death may receive the fatal mandate to strike you from the role of existence; and the friends who now surround you may be called upon to perform the last sad duty of laying you in the earth, a banquet for worms, and this fair body become as the relic you now hold in your hand. Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of sorrow; he cometh up and is cut down like a flower; he fleeth as a shadow and continue th not; in the midst of life we are in death; of whom may we seek for succor but of Thee, O Lord, who for our sins are justly displeased. Yet, O God most holy, thou God most mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us from the pains of eternal death. I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, write from henceforth, blessed are the dead that die in the Lord; even so, saith the spirit, for they rest from their labors; be ye also ready, and rest assured that a firm faith in the truths here revealed will afford you consolation in the gloomy hour of dissolution, and insure you ineffable and eternal happiness in the world to come. Amen and amen.\" Q. Where did your tour of penance end? A. It has not yet ended; neither can it end until this mortal shall put on immortality; for all men err, and all error need repentance. Q. Were you then permitted to participat e in the fifth libation? A. I was. Q. Where? A. Within the asylum. Q. How gained you admittance there? A. After havi ng passed my year of penance, I returned to the door of the asylum, where, on giving the al arm, the Warden appeared and demanded, \"Who comes there?\" Q. Your answer? A. Pilgrim pen itent, traveling from afar, who begs your permission here to rest, and at the shrine of our departed Lord to offer up his prayers and meditations. Q. What was then demanded of you? A. What surety can he offer that he is no impostor? Q. Your answer? A. The commendation of two true and courteous Knights, the Junior and Senior Wardens. Q. What was then demanded of you? A. By what further right or benef it I expected to gain admittance. Q. Your answer? A. By the benefit of a pass-word."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Q. Did you give that pass-word? A. I did not; my conductor gave it for me. Q. Give it? A. Golgotha. (It is given as before described.) Q. What was then said to you? A. Wait with faith and humility, and soon an answer shall be returned to your request. Q. What was the answer of the Grand Co mmander? A. That I should be admitted. Q. What did the Grand Commander then demand? A. Who have you there in charge, Sir Knight? Q. What answer was returned? A. A pilgrim pen itent, traveling from afar, who, having passed his term of penance, seeks now to participate in the fifth libation, ther eby to seal his fate. Q. What did the Grand Commander then observ e? A. Pilgrim, in granting your request and receiving you a Knight among our number, I can only offer you a rough habit, coarse diet, and severe duties; if, on [Pg 120] these conditions, you are still desir ous of enlisting under our banners, you will advance and kneel at the base of the triangle. Q. What did the Grand Commander then observe? A. Pilgrim, the fifth libation is taken in the most solemn and impressive manner; we cannot be too often reminded that we are born to die; and the fifth libation is an emblem of that bitter cup of death, of wh ich we must all sooner or later partake, and from which even the Saviour of the world, notwithstanding his ardent prayers and solicitations, was not exempt. Q. What was then said to you? A. The Grand Commander asked me if I had any repugnance to participate in the fifth libation. Q. Your answer? A. I am willing to conf orm to the requirements of the Order. Q. What followed? A. I then took the cup (the upper part of the human skull) in my hand, and repeated after the Grand Commander the following obligation: \"This pure wine I now take in testimony of my belief in the mortality of the body and the immortality of the soul, and may this libation appear as a witness against me, both here and hereafter, and as the sins of the world were laid upon the head of the Saviour, so may all the sins committed by the person whose scull this was be heaped upon my head, in addition to my own, should I ever knowingly or wilfully violate or transgress any obligation that I have heretofo re taken, take at this time, or shall at any future period take, in relation to any degree of Masonry, or Order of Knighthood. So help me God.\" Q. What was this obligation called? A. The sealed obligation. Q. Why so? A. Because any obligation entered in to, or promise made in reference to this obligation, is considered by Knight Templars as more binding and serious than any other special obligation could be. Q. What followed? A. The Most Excellent Prel ate then read the sixth lesson, relative to the election of Matthias. (See Chart.) Q. What followed? A. The Generalissimo t hus addressed the Grand Commander: \"Most Eminent, by the extinguished taper on the tria ngle, I perceive there is a vacancy in our Encampment, which I propose should be filled by a choice from among those valiant Knights who have sustained the trials and performed the ceremonies required by our Order.\" [18] Q. What followed? A. The Grand Commander then ordered the lots to be given forth, which being done, I was elected, and th e Grand Commander thus addre ssed me: \"In testimony of your election as a companion among us, and of your acceptance of that honor , you will relight that extinguished taper; and may the Almighty lift upon you the light of His countenance, and preserve you from falling.\""},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Q.

[This is repeated three times, at the same time laying the blade of the sword first upon the right shoulder, [Pg 121] then upon the head, and th en upon the left shoulder of the candidate.] Q.

H ISTORY .—St. Helena, daughter of Caylus, King of Britain, consort of Constantine, and mother of Constantine the Great, in the year 296, made a journey to the Holy Land in search of the cross of Jesus Christ. After leveling the hillocks and destroying the te mple of Venus, three cro sses were discovered. It was now difficult to discover which of the three was the one sought for by her. By order of his Holiness, Pope Marcellinus, they were borne to the bed of a woman who had long been visited by sickness, and lay at the point of death; she placed her hands upon the second cross first, which rendered her no service; but when she laid her hand upon the third, she was restored to her former health. She instantly arose, giving glory to God, saying, He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of sin was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. On the spot where the crosses were found, St. Helena erected a stately church, one hundred paces long and sixty wide; the east end takes in the place where the crosses stood, and the west of the sepulchre. By leveling the hills, the sepulchre is above the floor of the church, like a grotto, which is twenty feet from the floor to the top of the rock. There is a superb cupola over the sepulchre, and in the aisles are the tombs of Godfrey and Baldwin, kings of Jerusalem. In 302, St. Helena instituted the Order of Knights of the Holy Sepulchre of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. This Order was confirmed in 304 by his Holiness, Pope Marcellinus; they were bound by a sacred vow to guard the Holy Sepulchre, protect pilgrims, and fight infidels and enemies of the cross of [Pg 125] Christ. The city of Jerusalem was rebuilt and ornamented by Ælius Adrian, Emperor of Rome, and given to the Christians in 120. The Persians took it from them in 637, and in 1008 it fell into the hands of the Turks, under whose oppressions it long groaned, until Peter the Holy steered the western princes to release the distressed church, and in 1096 Godfrey and Baldwin unfurled the banner of the cross and expelled the Turks.

Whenever it occurs in the Hebrew Text, they substitute the word Adonai in its place. To those who read the original language of the Old Testament, it is known, that while the consonants of the Hebrew word remain, the vowel points may be so changed as to afford several different pronunciations. In the different degrees of Ineffable Masonry, the four consonants (Jod, He, Vau, He) of the name Jehovah are differently pointed, so as to furnish a word for each degree. In the degree of Perfection, the candidate is sworn not to pronounce the word but once during his life, hence it is termed INEFFABLE , or unutterable. The ordinary mode of giving it in that degree consists in simply repeating the names of its letters, \"Jod, He, Vau, He.\" On receiving that degree, the candidate is told that he is to become acquainted with the true pronunciation of the ineffable name of God, as it was revealed to Enoch. He is then taught to pronounce the word \"Ya-ho\"—sounding the a like a in wall. When written in Masonic manuscripts, this word is spelled \"Ja-hoh.\" SECRET MASTER.

I further promise never to be concerned in the initiation of any brother in this degree, unless he manifests a ch aritable disposition for Masonry, and a zeal for the brethren, and also ob tains permission, under the hands and seal of the first regular officers of a Lodge of Perfection. I fu rther promise that I will not debauch any female related to a companion of this degree, either by blood or marriage, knowing her to be such, under penalty of being crushed under the ruins of a subterraneous temple. So help, etc. Q. What followed? A. The Most Potent gave me the signs, token and words of this degree. Q. Give me the sign? A. (Made by kneeling on the left knee, the right ha nd on the back, the left raised above the head, the pa lm upward, the body leaning forward, alluding to the penalty.) Q. Give me the token? A. (Being in the last mentioned position token is made by raising each other from the same, by interlacing the fingers of the left hand.) Q. How many pass-words are th ere? A. One for each arch.

I was invested with the jewel, apron and gloves of this degree, and directed to salute the Senior Warden as a Kn ight of the Ninth Arch, a nd return to the east for further instruction. S ECOND S ECTION . —Question—Give me the history and char ge of this degree? Ans. My worthy brother, it is my intention, at this time, to give you a clearer account of certain historical traditions, etc. (to the words \"favored with a mystical vision\" ), when the Almighty thus designed to speak to him, as thou art desirous to know my name, atte nd, and it shall be revealed unto thee. Upon this, a mountain seemed to rise to the heavens, and Enoc h was transferred to the top thereof, where he beheld a triangular plate of gold most brilliantly enlightened, a nd upon which were some characters which he received a strict injunction never to pronounce. Presently he seemed to be lowered perpendicularly into the bowels of the earth through nine arches, in the ninth or deep est of which he saw the same brilliant plate which was shown to him in the mountain. In digging for a foundation they discovered an ancient edif ice, among which they found a consid erable quantity of treasure, such as vases of gold and silver, urns, marble, ja sper, and agate columns, and precious stones. All these treasures were collected and carried to Solomon, who upon de liberation concluded that they were the ruins of some ancient temple, erected before the flood, and possibly to the service of Idolatry. He, therefore, determined to build the temp le in another place, lest it should be polluted. Solomon caused a cavern to be constructed under th e temple, to which he gave the name of secret vault. He erected in this vault a large pillar of white marble , to support the Sanctum Sanctorum, and which, by inspiration, he called the p illar of beauty, from the beauty of the ark which it sustained. There was a long, narrow descent through nine arches from the palace of Solomon to this vault. To this place he was accustomed to retire with Hiram of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, when he had occasion to enter upon important business. There were none else, then living, qualifie d to enter this vault. One of their number being removed, disordered th eir business for a time. As the two kings were on one occasion consulting on business of the craft, app lication was made to them by several I's of B., I. K.'s and Grand Master Architects, soliciting th e honor of being admitted to the secret vault, to whom Solomon replied, \"My brethren, your request cannot now be granted.\" Some days afterwards Solomon sent for the three Grand Master Architects, Gibulum, Joabert and Stokin, and directed them to go and search among the ancient ruins, in hopes of di scovering more treasure. They departed, and one of them, viz., Gibulum, in wo rking with a pickaxe among the rubbish, discovered a large iron ring fixed in a cubic stone. On remo ving this stone, a cavern was discovered. Gibulum offered to descend. A rope be ing fastened 'round his body, and [Pg 157] in this manner he descended thrice, and discovered the golden triangle of Enoch, as was repres ented in the ceremony of your initiation. They then carried the stone and triangle to King Solomon, when the same circumstances occurred, which took place when you presented the same to us. The two Kings then informed the three Knights that they were ignorant of the tr ue pronunciation of the mysterious word until that time, and that this word being handed down through a succession of ages, had been much corrupted. The two Kings, accompanied by the three Kn ights, descended with the sacred treasure into the secret vault. They encrusted the golden plate upon the pedestal of the pillar of beauty, and the brilliancy of the plate was sufficient to enli ghten the place. The secret vault was afterwards called the sacred vault. Whenever the Lodge of Perfection was holde n, nine Knights of the Ninth Arch tiled the nine arches which led to the sacred vault; the most ancient st ood in the arch next to the anti-chamber of the vault, and so on in regu lar progression, the youngest taking his station in the first arch, which was near the apartment of Solomon. We were suffered to pass without giving"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"the pass-words of the different arches. There were living at that time several ancient masters, who, excited by jealousy at the honors conferred upon th e twenty-five brethren, deputed some of their number to wait upon Solomon, and request that they might participate in those honors. The King answered that the twenty -five masters were justly entitled to the honors conferred on them, for their zeal and fidelity. Go, said he, in peace, you may one day be rewarded according to your merits. Upon this, one of the deputies with an unbecoming warmth, obser ved to his companions, \"What occasion have we for a higher degree? We know the word has been changed, we can travel as masters, and receive pay as such.\" Solomon mildly replied, \"Those whom I have advanced to the degree of perfection, have wrought in the ancien t ruins, and though the undertaking was difficult and dangerous, they penetrated the bowels of the earth, and brought thence treasures to enrich and adorn the Temple of God. Go in peace, wait with patience, and aspire to perfection by good works.\" The deputies returned and reporte d their reception to the masters. These masters, vexed at the refusal, unanimously determined to go to the ancient ruins, and sear ch under ground, w ith a view of arrogating the merit necessary for the accomplishmen t of their desires. They departed the next morning, and raising the cubic stone descended into the cavern with a ladder of ropes, by the light of torches, where no sooner had the last descende d, than the nine arches fell in upon them. Solomon hearing of this accident, sent Gibulum, Joabert and Stokin to inform themselves more particularly of the matter. They departed at break of day, a nd upon their arrival at the place, could discover no remains of the arches, nor could they learn that one single one of all those who had descended escaped the destruction. They examined the pl ace with diligence, but found nothing except a few pieces of marble, on which were inscribed certain hi eroglyphics; these they carried to Solomon, and related what they had seen. King Solomon examini ng these hieroglyphics, discovered that these pieces of marble were part of one of the pillar s of Enoch. Solomon ordered these pieces of marble to be carefully put together a nd deposited in the sacred vault. [Pg 158] Q. What followed? A. The Most Potent gave me the mysterious characters of this degree, which were engraved on the triangle of Enoch.

Q. What then followed? A. Shortly after, the Master of Ceremonies [Pg 161] conducted me again into the Lodge, and placing me in the west, I was asked the following questions, viz.:—1st, Have you never wilfully revealed any of the secrets of Masonry? 2d, Have you always been charitable towards your brethren? 3d, Have you never defrauded a brother? 4th, Are you in the habit of using the name of God profanely? 5th, Does your conscience accuse you of having committed any offence against your brethren, which ought to deba r you from receiving this degree?

The Most Perfect thus addressed me: \"You are al ready acquainted with the fact, that the true pronuncia tion of the name of God was revealed to Enoch, and that he engraved the letters composing that name on a triangular plate of gold. The name was represented by the four Hebrew consonants, Jod, He, Vau, a nd He. The vowel sounds of this language being represented by points placed above the consonants, and being frequently omitted in writing, the consonants composing the mysterious word, at di fferent ages, received different pronunciations. Hence, though the method of writing this word remained uniform, its pronunciation underwent"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"many changes. These changes constitute what are termed the different ages of Masonry. These are 3, 5, 7 and 9.

The ages of Masonry, 3, 5, 7, 9—24, multiplied by 3, the number gotten who discovered Tunsune (noticed in th e degree of the Knight of the Ni nth Arch), gives the product 72; to this add 9, the number of co rrupted words, the amount is 81. The mysterious words which you received in the preceding degrees, are all so many co rruptions of the true name (of God) which was engraved on the triangle of Enoch.

This Council must be illuminated by one single light, and is enlightened by one divine light: because there is one single light that shines among men, who have the happiness of going from the darkness of ignorance and of the vulga r prejudices, to follow the only lig ht that leads to the celestial truth. The light that is in our L odge, is composed of a glass globe filled w ith water, and a light placed behind it, which renders the light more clear. The glass of reflection, the globe, when it is lighted, is placed in the south. R OBE AND S CEPTRE . —The Grand Master or Thrice Puissant , is named \"Father Adam,\" who is placed in the East, vested in a robe of pale ye llow, like the morning. He has his hat on, and in his right hand a sceptre, on the top of which is a glob e of gold. The handle or extremity of the sceptre is gilt. The reason that Father Ad am carries the globe above the s ceptre in this Council is, because he was constituted Sovereign Master of the world, and created Sovereign Father of all men. He carries a S UN suspended by a chain of gold around his neck; and on the reverse of this jewel of gold is a globe. When this degree is given, no jewel or apron is worn. There is only one Warden, who sits opposite Father Adam in the west, a nd is called Brother Truth. He is entitled to the same ornaments as Father Adam; and the order that belongs to this degree is a broad white watered ri bbon worn as a collar, with an eye of gold embroidered thereon, above the gold chain and jewel of the sun. The numb er of other officers is seven, and are called by the name of the cherubim, as follows: Zaphriel, Zabriel, Camiel, Uriel, Michael, Zaphael, and Gabriel. These ought to be decora ted in the same manner as the Thrice Puissant Father Adam. If there are more than that number of the Knights of the Sun, they go by the name of Sylphs, and are the preparers of the Council, and assistants in all the ceremonies or operations of the Lodge. They are entitled to the same jewel, but have a ribbon of a fiery color tied to the third button-hole of their coat. T O O PEN THE G RAND C OUNCIL . —Father Adam says:—\"Brother Tr uth, what time is it on earth?\" Brother Truth: \"Mi ghty Father, it is midnight among the profan e, or cowans, but the sun is in its meridian in this Lodge.\" Father Adam: \"My dear children, profit by the favor of this austere luminary, at present showing its light to us, which will conduct us in the path of virtue, and to follow that law which is eternally to be engr aved on our hearts, and the only law by which we cannot fail to come to the knowledge of pure truth.\" He then makes a sign, by putting his right hand on his left breast; on which all the brethren put up the first finger of the right hand above their heads, the other fingers clenched, showing by that, that there is but one G od, who is the beginning of all truth; then Father Adam says, \"This Lodge is opened.\" F ORM OF R ECEPTION . —After the Council is open ed, the candidate is in troduced into an ante- chamber, where there are a number of Sylphs, each with a bellows, blowing a large pot of fire, which the candidate [Pg 165] sees, but they take no notice of him. Af ter he is left in that situation two or three minutes, the most ancient of the Sylphs goes to the candidate an d covers his face with black crape. He must be without a sword, and is to ld that he must find the door of the Sanctuary, and when found, to knock on it six times with an open hand. After he finds the door and knocks, Brother Truth goes to the door, and having opened it a little, asks the candidate the following questions, which he answers by the help of the Sylphs. \"Q. What do you desire? A. I desire to go out of darkness to see the true light, and to know the true light in all its purity. Q. What do you desire more? A. To divest myself of original sin, and dest roy the juvenile prejud ices of error, which all men are liable to, namely, the desire of all worldly attachments and pr ide.\" On which Brother Truth comes to Father Adam, and relates what the candidate has told him; when Father Adam gives"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"orders to introduce the candidate to the true happiness. Th en Brother Truth opens the door, and takes the candidate by the hand, an d conducts him to the middle of the Lodge or Sanctuary, which is also covered by a black cloth, when Father Adam addresses him thus: \"My son, seeing by your labor in the royal art, you are now come to the desire of knowle dge of the pure and holy truth, we shall lay it open to you without a ny disguise or covering. But, before we do this, consult your heart, and see in this moment if you feel yourself disposed to obey her (nam ely truth) in all things which she commands. If you are disposed, I am sure she is ready in your heart, and you must feel an emotion that was unknown to you before. This being the case, you must hope that she will not be long to manifest herself to you. But have a care not to defile the sanctuary by a spirit of curiosity; and take care not to increase the number of the vulgar and profane, that have for so long a time ill- treated her, until Truth was oblig ed to depart the earth, and now can hardly trace any of her footsteps. But she always appears in her greate st glory, without disguise, to the true, good, and honest Free Masons; that is to say, to the zealous extirpators of superstition and lies. I hope, my dear brother, you will be one of her intimate favorites. The proofs that you have given, assure me of everything I have to expect of your zeal; for as nothing now can be more a secret among us, I shall order brother Truth, that he will in struct you what you are to do in orde r to come to true happiness.\" After this discourse of Father Adam, the candidate is unveiled and shown the form of the Lodge or Council, without explaining any part thereof. Brothe r Truth then proceeds t hus: \"My dear brother, by my mouth, holy truth speaketh to you, but before she can manifest herself to you, she requires of you proofs in which she is satisfied in your entran ce into the Masonic order. She has appeared to you in many things which you could not have apprehended or comprehended without her assistance; but now you have the happiness to arrive at the brilliant day, not hing can be a secret to you. Learn, then, the moral use that is made of th e three first parts of the furniture, which you knew after you was received an Entere d Apprentice Mason, vi z.: Bible, Compass and Square. By the Bible you are to understand that it is the only law you ought to fo llow. It is that which Adam [Pg 166] received at his creation, and which the Almighty engraved in his heart. This law is called natural law, and shows positively that there is but one G od, and to adore him only without any subdivision or interpolation. The Compass gives you the faculty of judging for yourself, that whatever God has created, is well, and he is the sovereign author of every thing. Existing in himself, nothing is either good or evil; because we understand by this expressi on, an action done which is excellent in itself, is relative, and submits to the human understandi ng, or judgment, to know the value and price of such action; and that God, with whom every thi ng is possible, communicates nothing of his will, but such as his great goodness pleases; and ever y thing in the universe is governed as he has decreed it, with justice, being ab le to compare it with the attribut es of the Divinity. I equally say, that in himself there is no evil; because he has ma de every thing with exactness, and that every thing exists according to his will; consequentl y, as it ought to be. This distance between good and evil with the Divinity, cannot be more justly and cl early compared than by a circle formed with a compass. From the points being reunited there is formed an entire circumference; and when any point in particular equally appr oaches or equally se parates from its point , it is only a faint resemblance of the distance between good and evil, which we compare by the points of a compass forming a circle, which circ le when completed is God. S QUARE . —By the Square we discover that God, who has made every thing equal, in the same manner that you are not able to dig a body in a quarry complete, or perfect; thus, the wish of the Eternal in creating the world by a liberal act of his own, well foresaw every matter that could possibly happen in consequence thereof; that is to say, that every thing therein contained at the same time of the creation was good.

By the leve l you are to learn to be upright and sincere, and not to suffer yourself to be drawn away by the multitude of the blind"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"and ignorant people; to be always firm and steady to sustain the ri ght of the natural law, and the pure and real knowledge of th at truth which it teacheth.

T RESSLE - BOARD . —You have seen the tressle-board, to dr aw plans on. This represents the man whose whole occupation is the art of thinking, and who employs his r eason in that which is just and reasonable. C UBIC S TONE . —You have seen the cubic stone, the mo ral of which, and the sense you ought to draw from it, is, to rule your actions, that they might be e qually brought to the sovereign good. P ILLARS . —The two pillars teacheth you th at all Masons ought to atta ch themselves firmly to become an ornament to the order, as well as to its support; as the pillars of Hercules formerly determined the end of the ancient world. B LAZING S TAR . —You have seen the blazing star, the mo ral sense of which is, \"a true Mason perfecting himself in the way of truth,\" that he [Pg 167] may become like a blazing star which shineth equally during the thickest darkness; and it is useful to those that it shineth upon, and who are ready and desirous of profiting by its light. The first instructions have conduc ted you to the knowledge of Hiram Abiff, and the inquiries that were made in finding him out. You have been inform ed of the words, signs and tokens which were substituted for those we feared w ould have been surprised, but of wh ich they afterwards learnt that the treacherous villains had not be en able to receive any knowledge of; and this ought to be an example and salutary advice to you, to be alwa ys on your guard, and well persuaded that it is difficult to escape the snares that ignorance, joined to conceited opinion, lay every day against us, and thereby to overcome us; and the most virtu ous men are liable to fall, because their candor renders them unsuspecting. But, in this case, you ought to be firm as our Respectable Father Hiram, who chose rather to be massacred th an to give up what he had obtained. This will teach you that as soon as truth shall be fixed in your heart, you ought never to consider the resolution you should take; you must live and die to sustain the light, by which we acquire the sovereign good. We must never e xpose ourselves to the conversa tion of cowans, and must be circumspect even with those with whom we are th e most intimate; and not deliver up ourselves to any, excepting those whose character and behavior have proved them brot hers, who are worthy to come and appear in the sacred sanctuary where holy Truth delivers her oracles. You have passed the Secret and Perfect Master; you have been decorated with an ivory key, a symbol of your distinction; you have received th e pronunciation of the ineffable name of the Great Architect of the universe, and have been placed at the first balustrade of the sanctuary; you have had rank among the Levites, after which you knew the wo rd \"Zizon,\" which signi fies \"a balustrade of the Levites;\" where all those ar e placed, as well as yourself, to expect the knowledge of the most sublime mysteries. C OFFIN AND R OPE . —In the degree of Perfect Master they have shown you a grave, a coffin, and a \"withe rope,\" to raise and deposit the body in a sepulchre, made in th e form of a pyramid, in the top of which was a triangle, within which was the sacr ed name of the Eternal, and on the pavement were the two columns of Jachin and Boaz laid across.

P YRAMID . —The pyramid represents the true Mason who raises himself by degrees, till he reaches heaven, to adore the sacred and unalte rable name of the Eternal Supreme. [Pg 168] I NTIMATE S ECRETARY . —This new degree leads you near to Solomon and honor; and after you redoubled your zeal, you gained new honors and favors, having nearly lost your life by curiosity; which atta chment to Masonry gave you the good qualities of your heart, and which obtained your pardon and let you to the \"Intendant of the Buildings,\" where you saw a \"blazing star,\" a large candlestick with seven branches, w ith altars, vases, and purification, and a great brazen sea. B LAZING S TAR . —By the expression of PURIFICATION you are to understand that you are to be cleansed from impiety and prejudice before you can acquire more of the sublime knowledge in passing the other degrees, to be able to support th e brilliant light of reason, enlightened by truth, of which the blazing star is the figure. C ANDLESTICK WITH S EVEN B RANCHES . —By the candlestick with seven branches you are to remember the mysterious number of the seven Ma sters who were named to succeed one; and from that time it was resolved that seven Knights of Ma sonry, united together, were able to initiate into Masonry, and show them the seven gifts of th e Eternal, which we shall give you a perfect knowledge of, when you have been purified in the Brazen Sea. B RAZEN S EA . —You have passed from the Secret and Pe rfect Master to th e Intimate Secretary, Provost and Judge, and Intendant of the Buildings. In these degrees they ha ve shown you an ebony box, a key suspended, a balan ce, and an inflamed urn. E BONY B OX . —The ebony box shows you with what scrupu lous attention you are to keep the secrets that have been confided to you, and which you are to reserve in the closet of your heart, of which the box is an emblem. And were you to reflect on the black co lor of said box, it would teach you to cover your secrets with a thick veil, in such a manner that the profane cowans cannot possibly have any knowledge thereof. K EY . —The key demonstrates that you have alrea dy obtained a key to our knowledge, and part of our mysteries; and if you behave with equity, fervor, and zeal to your brothers, you will arrive shortly to the knowledge and meani ng of our society, and this indica tes the reason of the balance. I NFLAMED U RN . —By the inflamed urn you are to understa nd, that as far as you come to the knowledge of the Royal and Sublime Art, you mu st, by your behavior, leave behind you, in the minds of your brethren and the vulgar, a high id ea of your virtue, equal to the perfume of the burning urn. T WO K INGS . —In the degree of Intimate Secretary, you ha ve seen and heard two kings who were entering into their new alliance and reciprocal promise, and of the perfection of their grand enterprise. They spoke of the death of Hiram Ab iff, our Excellent Master. You saw guards, as a man who was overseen, very near of being put to d eath for his curiosity of peeping. You also heard of the prospect of a place calle d the vault, to deposit the precious treasure of Masonry, when the time should be fulfilled, and you afte rwards became a brother. The c onversation of the two kings is the figure of the coincidence of our laws and the natural [Pg 169] law, which forms a perfect agreement with what is expedient, and promises to those who shall have the happiness to be connected to you in the same manner and perfect al liance that they will af terwards come to the centre of true knowledge. T EARS . —The tears and regret of the two kings are the emblem of the regret you ought to have when you perceive a brother depa rt from the road of virtue."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"T HE M AN P EEPING . —By the man you saw peeping, and w ho was discovered and seized, and conducted to death, is an emblem of those who come to be initi ated into our sacred mysteries through a motive of curiosity; and, if so indiscreet as to divulge their ob ligations, we are bound to take vengeance on the treason by the destruction of the traitor. Let us pray the Eternal to preserve our order from such an evil you have hereof seen an example, in that de gree to which you came, by your zeal, fervor and constancy. In that degree you have remarked, that from all the favorites that were at that time in the apartment of Solomon, only nine were elected to avenge the death of Hiram Abiff; this makes good, that a gr eat many are often called, but few c hosen. To explain this enigma, a great many of the profane have the happiness to di vest themselves of that name, to see and obtain the entrance in our sanctuary; but very few are c onstant, zealous and fervent, to merit the happiness of coming to the height and know ledge of the sublime truth. R EQUISITIONS T O M AKE A G OOD M ASON . —If you ask me what are the requisite qualities that a Mason must be possessed of, to come to the centre of truth, I answer you, that you must crush the head of the serpent of ignorance. You must shake off the yoke of infant prejudice concerning the mysteries of the reigning religion, which wors hip has been imaginary, and only founded on the spirit of pride, which envies to command and be di stinguished, and to be at the head of the vulgar; in affecting an exterior purity, whic h characterizes a false piety, joined to a desire of acquiring that which is not its own, and is always the subject of th is exterior pride, and un alterable sour ce of many disorders, which being joined to gluttonness, is the daughter of hypocrisy, and employs every matter to satisfy carnal desires, and raises to these predominant passions, altars, upon which she maintains, without ceasing, the light of iniquity, and sacrifices continually offerings to luxury, voluptuousness, hatred, envy, and perj ury. Behold, my dear brother, what you must fight against and destroy before you can come to the knowle dge of the true good and sovereign happiness! Behold this monster which you must conquer—a serpent which we detest as an idol, that is adored by the idiot and vulgar unde r the name of religion. S OLOMON , K ING H IRAM , AND S T . J OHN THE B APTIST . —In the degrees of Elected of Fifteen, Illustrious Knights, Grand Master Architects, and Knights of the Ninth Arch, you have seen many things which are only a repetiti on of what you have already examined. You will always find in those degrees initial letters enclosed in different tr iangles, or Deltas. You ha ve also seen the planet Mercury, the chamber called \"Gabaon,\" or the \"Third Heaven;\" the \"w inding staircase, \" the \"Ark of Alliance,\" the \"tomb of Hiram Abiff,\" f acing the ark and the urn—the precious [Pg 170] treasure found by the assiduous travels—the three zealous brethren Masons —the punishment of the haughty Master Mason, in being buried under the ancient ruins of Enoch's temple —and finally, you have seen the figures of Solomon, and Hiram, King of Tyre, and St. John the Baptist. 3. I. I. I.—By the 3. I. I. I. you know the three sacred names of the Eternal and \"Mount Gabaon\" (Third Heaven) which you came to by seven de grees that compose the winding staircase. The seven stars represent the se ven principal and different degr ees to which you must come to attain the height of glory represented by the mount , where they formerly sacrificed to the Most High! When you arrive to that, you are to subdue your passions, in not doing anything that is not prescribed in our laws. By the planet Mercury, you are taught continually to mistrust, shun, and run away from those who, by a false practice, maintain commerce with pe ople of a vicious life, who seem to despise the most sacred mysteries—that is, to depart from those who by the vulgar fear, or a bad understanding, are ready to deny the solemn oblig ations that they have contracted among us.— When you come to the foot of our arch you are to apprehend that you come to the \"Sanctum Sanctorum.\" You are not to return; but rather to pe rsist in sustaining the glor y of our order, and the truth of our laws, principles, and mysteries, in like manner as our Respectable Father Hiram Abiff, who deserved to have been buried there for his constancy and fidelity. We have also another"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"example in the firmness of \"Galaad,\" the son of \"Sophonia,\" chief of the Levites, under Surnam, the High Priest, as mentioned in the history of perfection. Learn in this moment, my dear brother, what you are to understand by the figures of Solomon, Hiram, King of Tyre, and St. J ohn the Baptist. The two first exert you, by their zeal in the royal art, to follow th e sublime road of which Solomon was the institutor, and Hiram of Tyre, the \"supporter;\" a tit le legitimately due to th at king, who not only protected the order, but contributed with all his might to the construction of the temple (furnishing stone from Tyre, and the cedars of Lebanus) which Solomon built to the honor of the Almighty. The third, or St. John the Baptist, teaches you to preach marvellous to th is order, which is as much as to say, you are to make secret missions among men, which you believe to be in a state of entering the road of truth, that they may be ab le one day to see her virtues and visage uncovered. H IRAM A BIFF was the symbol of truth on earth. Jube lum Akirop was accused by the serpent of ignorance, which to this day raises altars in the hearts of the profane and fearful. This profaneness, backened by a fanatic zeal, becomes an instrument to the religious power, which struck the first stroke in the heart of our dear Father, Hiram Abiff; which is as much as to say, undermined the foundation of the celestial temple, wh ich the Eternal himself had ordere d to be raised to the sublime truth and his glory. The first age of the world has been witness to what I have advanced. The simple, natural law rendered to our first fathers the most [Pg 171] uninterrupted happiness. They were in those times more virtuous; but as soon as the \"monster of pride\" star ted up in the air and disclosed herself to those unhappy mortals, she promised to them every seat of happiness, and seduced them by her soft and bewitching speeches, viz.: That \"they must render to the Eternal Creator of all things an adoration with more testimony, and more exte nsive, than they had hitherto done,\" etc. This Hydra with a hundred heads, at that time misled, and continues to this day to mislead men who are so weak as to submit to her empire; and it will subsist, until the moment that the true elected shall appear and destroy her entirely. The degree of Sublime Elected, that you have passed, gives you the knowledge of those things which conducts you to the true and solid good. The grand circle represents the immensity of the Eternal Supreme, who has neither beginning nor end. The triangle, or Delta, is the mysterious figure of the Eternal. The three letters which you see, signify as follows:—G, at the top of the triangle, \"the grand cause of the Masons\": the S, at the left hand, the \"submission to the same order\": and the U, at the right hand, the \"union that ought to reign among the brethren: which, altogether make but one body, or equa l figure in all its parts.\" This is the triangle called \"equilateral.\" The great letter G, placed in the centre of the triangle, signifies \"Great Architect of the Universe,\" who is God; and in th is ineffable name is found all the divine attributes. This letter being placed in the centre of the triangle, is for us to understand that every true Mason must have it profoundly in his heart. There is another triangle, on wh ich is engraved S. B. and N., of which you have had an explanation in a preceding degree. This triangle designs the connec tion of the brethren in virtue. The solemn promise they have made to love each ot her; to help, succor, and keep inviolably secret, their mysteries of the perfection prop osed, in all their enterprises. It is said in that degree, that \"You have entered the Third Heaven, that means you ha ve entered the place where pure truth resides, since she abandoned the earth to monsters who persecuted her.\" The end of the degree of Perfec tion is a preparation to come mo re clearly to the knowledge of true happiness, in becoming a tr ue Mason, enlightened by the cel estial luminary of truth, in"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"renouncing, voluntarily, all adorations but those that are made to one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, great, good, and merciful. End of Brother Truth's harangue. Father Adam then says to the candidate, \"My d ear son, what you have heard from the mouth of Truth is an abridgment of all the consequences of all the degrees you have gone through, in order to come to the knowledge of the holy truth, contracted in your last engagements. Do you persist in your demand of coming to the holy brother, and is that what you desire, with a clear heart?— answer me.\" The candidate [Pg 172] answers, \"I persist.\" Then Father Adam says, \"Brother Truth, as the candidate persists, approach with him to the sanctuary, in order that he may take a solemn obligation to follow our laws , principles, and morals, and to attach himself to us forever.\" Then the candidate falls on his knees, and Father Adam ta kes his hands between hi s own, and the candidate repeats the following obligation three times: O BLIGATION .—I, A. B., promise, in the face of God, and between the hands of my Sovereign, and in presence of all the brethren now present, never to take arms against my country, directly or indirectly, in any conspiracy against the Government thereof. I promise never to reveal any of the degrees of the Knight of the Sun, which is now on the point of being intrusted to me, to any person or persons whatsoever, without being duly qualified to receive th e same; and never to give my consent to any one to be admitted into our mysteries, only after the most scrupulous circumspection, and full knowledge of his life and conversation; and who has given at all tim es full proof of his zeal and fervent attachment for the order, and a submission at all times to the tribuna l of the Sovereign Princes of the Royal Secret. I promise never to confer the degree of the Knights of the Sun without having a permission in writing from the Grand Council of Princes of the Royal Secret, or from the Grand Inspector or his deputy, known by their titles and authority. I promise also and swear, that I will not assist any, through my means, to form or raise a Lodge of the Sublime Orders, in this country, \"without proper authority.\" I promise and swear to redouble my zeal for all my brethren, Knights, and Princes, that are present or absent; and if I fail in this my obligation, I consent for all my brethren, when they are convinced of my infidelity, to seize me, and thrust my tongue through with a red-hot iron; to pluck out both my eyes, and to deprive me of smelling and hearing; to cut off both my hands, and to expose me in that condition in the field, to be devoured by the voracious animals; and if none can be found, I wish the lightning of heaven might execute on me the same vengeance. O God, maintain me in right and equity. Amen. Amen. Amen. After the obligation is three times repeated, Fath er Adam raises the candidate, and gives him one kiss on his forehead, being the seat of the soul. He then decorates him with the collar and jewel of the order, and gives him the following sign, token and word:— S IGN : Place the right hand flat upon the heart, the thumb forming a square. The answ er, raise the hand, and w ith the index point to heaven. This is to show that there is but one God, the source of all truth. T OKEN : Take in your hands those of your brother, and press them gently. Some Kn ights, in addition to this, kiss the forehead of the brother, saying \"Alpha,\" to which he answers, \"Omega.\" S ACRED W ORD : \"Adonai.\" This word is answered by \"Albra,\" or \"Abbraa k,\" which is rendered \"a king w ithout reproach.\" Some contend that this word should be written \"Abrah.\" P ASS - WORD :—\"Stibium\" (antimony). By this is intended as among the Hermetic Philosophers, \"the primitive matter whence all things are formed.\" To this pass-word some add the following: \"H elios,\" \"Mene,\" \"Tetragrammaton.\" After these are given, the candida te goes 'round and gives them to every one, whic h brings him back to Father Adam. He then sits down with the rest of the brethren, and then Brother Truth gives the following explanation of the Philosophical Lodge: S UN . —The sun represents the unity of the Eterna l Supreme, the only grand work of philosophy.

I cannot unfold the sacred characters in this manner, but substitute in its place the grand word of [represented by the Hebrew consonants Jod, He, Vau, He.] Q. What do you understand by throwing down the column s that sustained the pillar of beauty. A. Two reasons.—First. When the temple [Pg 175] was destroyed by Nebuzarada n, general of the army of Nebuchadnezzar, I was one that helped to defe nd the Delta on which was engraved the ineffable name; and I broke down the columns of beauty, in order that it should not be profaned by the infidels.

My desire is to come to the celestial truth, and to travel by the light of the sun. Q. What represents that body? A. It is the fi gure of an only God, to whom we ought to pay our adoration. The sun being the emblem of God, we ought to regard it as the im age of the Divinity; for that immense body represents wonderfully the infi nity of God.

Q. What signifies the four triangles that are in the great circles? A. They are the emblems of the four principal views of the life of tranquility, etc. First. Fraterna l love to all mankind in general, more particularly for our brethren, who are more attached to us, and who with honor have seen the wretchedness of the vulgar. Second. To be cautious among us of things, and not to demonstrate them clearly to any who are [Pg 178] not proper to receive them; and to be likewise cautious in giving credit to any matter, however ar tfully it may be disguised, without a self-conviction in the heart. Third. To cast from us every matter which we percei ve we may ever repent of doing, taking care of this moral precept, \"To do to every one of your fe llow creatures no more than you would choose to be done to.\" Fourth. We ought always to confid e in our Creator's bounty, and to pray without ceasing, that all our necessities might be relieved as it seems best to him for our advantage; to wait for his blessings patiently in this life; to be pe rsuaded of his sublime decrees, that whatever might fall, contrary to our wishes, will be attended with good consequences; to take his chastisements patiently, and be assured that the end of everything has been done by him for the best, and will certainly lead us to eternal happiness hereafter."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Q.

The Senior Warden then says, \"See, my brethren, a man who has spilled his bl ood to acquire a knowledge of our mysteries, and shrunk not from the trial!\" Then the Most Puissant opens the first Seal of the great book, and takes from thence a bone quiver, filled with arrows, and a crown, and gives them to one of the Ancients, and says to him, \"Depart and continue the conq uest.\" He opens the second Seal, and takes out a sword, and gives it to the next aged, and says, \"Go, and destroy peace among the profane and wicked brethren, that they may never appear in our Council.\" He opens the third Seal, and takes a balance, and gives it to the next aged, and says, \"Dispense rigid justice to the profane and wicked brethren.\" He opens the fourth S eal, and takes out a scull, and give s it to the next aged, and says, \"Go, and endeavor to convince the wi cked that death is the reward of their guilt.\" He opens the fifth Seal, and takes out a cloth, stained with blood, and gives it to the next aged, and says, \"When is the time (or, the time will arrive,) that we shall re venge and punish the profane and wicked, who have destroyed so many of their bret hren by false accusations.\" He opens the sixth Seal, and that moment the sun is darkened and the moon stained with blood! He ope ns the seventh Seal, and takes out incense, which he gives to a brother; and also a vase, with seven trumpets, and gives one to each of the seven aged brethren. After this, the four old men, in the four corners, show their inflated bladders (beeves' bladders, filled with wind under their arms), representing the four winds: when the Most Puissant says \"Here is seen the fulfilm ent of a prophecy;\" (Rev. vii. 3). Strike not, nor punish the profane and wicked of ou r order, until I have selected the true and worthy Masons!

[Pg 188] O RIGIN OF THIS D EGREE . —When the Knights and Princes were embodied to conquer the Holy Land, they took a cross to distinguish them, as a mark of being under its banners; they also took an oath to spend the last drop of their blo od to establish the true religion of the Most High God. Peace being made, they could not fulfil their vows, and, theref ore, returning home to their respective countries, they resolved to do in theory what they could not do by practice, and determined never to admit, or initiate, any into their mystic ceremonies, but those who had given proofs of friendship, zeal, and disc retion. They took the name of Knights of the East and West, in memory of their homes and the place where the orde r began; and they have ever since strictly adhered to their ancient customs and forms. In th e year 1118, the first Knights, to the number of eleven, took their vows between the hands of Gari mont, Patriarch and Prince of Jerusalem, from whence the custom is derived of taki ng the obligation in the same position. L ECTURE . —Question—Are you a Knight of the East and West? A. I am. Q. What did you see when you were receiv ed? A. Things that were marvellous. Q. How were you received? A. By water and the effusion of blood. Q. Explain this to me? A. A Mason should not hesitate to spill his blood for the support of Masonry. Q. What are the ornaments of the Grand Counc il? A. Superb thrones, sun, more perfumed ointment, and a basin of water. Q. What is the figure of the draft? A. An heptagon within a circle. Q. What is the representation of it? A. A man ve sted in a white robe, with a golden girdle 'round his waist—'round his right hand seven stars—hi s head surrounded with a glory, a long, white beard—a two-edged sword across his mouth, surrounde d by seven candlesticks, with these letters: H. D. P. I. P. R. Q. What signifies the circle? A. As the circle is finished by a point, so should a Lodge be united by brotherly love and affection. Q. What signifies the heptagon? A. Our mystic number which is enclosed in seven letters. Q. What are the seven letters? A. B. D. W. P. H. G. S.; wh ich signifies B eauty, Divinity, Wisdom, Power, Honor, Glory, and Strength. Q. Give me the explanation of th ese words? A. Beauty to adorn; Divinity, that Masonry is of divine origin; Wisdom, a quality to invent; Power, to destroy th e profane and unworthy brethren; Honor, is an indispensable quality in a Mason, that he may support himself in his engagements with respectability; Glory, that a good Mas on is on an equality with the gr eatest prince; and Strength, is necessary to sustain us. Q. What signifies the seven stars? A. The se ven qualities which Masons should be possessed of: Friendship, Union, Submission, Discretion, Fidelity, Prudence and Temperance. Q. Why should a Mason be possessed of these qua lities? A. Friendship, is a virtue that should reign among brothers; Union, is th e foundation of society; Submissi on, to the laws, regulations, and decrees of the Lodge, without murmuring; Discre tion, that a Mason should always be on his guard, and never suffer himself to be surprised; Fidelity, in [Pg 189] observing strictly our obligations; Prudence, to conduct ourselves in such a manner that the profane, though jealous, may never be able to censure our conduct; and Temperance, to a void all excesses that may injure either body or soul."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Q. What signifies the seven candlesticks, with their seven letters? A. seven crimes, which Masons should always avoid, vi z.: Hatred, Discord, Pride, Indi scretion, Perfidy, Rashness, and Calumny. Q. What are the reasons that Masons should partic ularly avoid these crimes ? A. Because they are incompatible with the principles and qualities of a good Mason, w ho should avoid doing an injury to a brother, even should he be ill-treated by him, and to unite in himself all the qualities of a good and upright man. Discord, is contrary to the very principles of society; Pride, prevents the exercise of humanity; Indiscretion, is fatal to Masonry; Perfidy, should be execrated by every honest man; Rashness, may lead us into unpleasant and disagreeab le dilemmas; and Calumny, the worst of all, should be shunned as a vice which saps the very foundation of friendship and society. Q. What signifies the two-edged sword? A. It expresses the supe riority of this degree over all others that precede it. Q. Are there any higher degrees than this? A. Yes; there are several. Q. What signifies the book with seven seals, which none but one can open? A. A Lodge, or Council, of Masons, which the Most Puissa nt alone has a right to convene and open. Q. What is enclosed in the first seal ? A. One bow, one arrow, and one crown. Q. What in the second? A. A two-edged sword. Q. What in the third? A. A balance. Q. What in the fourth? A. Death's head. Q. What in the fifth? A. A cloth stained with blood. Q. What in the sixth? A. The power to da rken the sun, and tinge the moon with blood. Q. What in the seventh? A. Seven trumpets and perfumes. Q.

The sword, that the Council is always arme d to punish the guilty. The balance is a symbol of justice. The skull is the image of a brother who is excluded from a Lodge or Council. This idea must make all tremble when they recollect the pe nalties they have imposed on themselves under the most solemn obligations! The cloth stained with bl ood, that we should not hesitate to spill ours for the good of Masonry. The power of obscuring th e sun and tinging the moon with blood, is the representation of the power of th e Superior Councils—in interdicti ng their works, if they are irregular, until they have acknowledged their error, and submitted to the rules and regulations of the craft established by the Grand Constitutions. The se ven trumpets, signify that Masonry is extended over the surface of the earth, on th e wings of fame, and supports its elf with honor. The perfumes denote that the life of a good [Pg 190] Mason should be, and is free from all reproach, and is perfumed by means of good report. Q. What age are you? A. Very ancient. Q. Who are you? A. I am a Patmian: (i.e., of Patmos.) Q. Whence came you? A. From Pa tmos. End of the lecture. T O C LOSE . —Q. What is the o'clock? Ans. There is no more time.

For what reason do the Master Masons in the Symbolic Lodges speak of a sprig of cassia? A.

That a wise man may err, and when he is sensible of his fault, correct himself by acknowledging that fault, whereby he claims the indulgence of his brethren. Q. Why do the Symbolic Lodges take the name of St. John of Jerusalem? A. Because in the time of the Crusades, the Perfect Masons, Knights, and Princes, communicated their mysteries to the Knights of that order; where upon it was determined to celebrat e their festival annually, on St. John's day, being under the same law.

What is the reason why the number eighty-one is held in such esteem among Princes of Masons? A.

Those zealous brethren chose Solomon's temple for their model. This building has strong a llusions to the Christian church. Since that period they (Masons) have been known by the name of Master Architect; and they have employed themselves in improving the law of that admirable Master. From hence it appears that the mysteries of the craft are the mysteries of religion. Those brethren were careful not to entrust this important secret to any whose discretion they had not proved. For this reason they invented different degrees to try those who entered among them; and only gave them symbolical secrets, without explanation, to prevent treachery, and to make themselves known only to each other. For this purpose it was resolved to use different signs, words, and tokens , in every degree, by which they would be secured against cowans and Saracens. The different degrees were fixed first to the number of seven by the example of the Grand Architect of the Universe, who built all things in six days and rested on the seventh. This is distinguished by seven points of reception in the Master's degrees. Enoch employed six days to construct th e arches, and on the seventh, having deposited the secret treasure in the lowest arch, was translated to the abodes of the blessed. Solomon employed six years in constructing his temple; and celebrated its dedication on the seventh, with all the solemnity worthy of the divinity himself. This sacred edifice we choose to make the basis of figurative Masonry. In the first degree are three symbols to be applied. First, the first of the creation, which was only chaos, is figured by the candidate's coming out of the black chamber, neither naked nor clothed, deprived, etc.; and his suffering th e painful trial at his reception, etc. The candidate sees nothing before he is brought to light; a nd his powers of imagination relativ e to what he has to go through are suspended, which alludes to the figure of th e creation of that vast luminous body confused among the other parts of creation before it was ex tracted from darkness and fixed by the Almighty fiat. Secondly, the candidate a pproaches the footstool of the Master, and there renounces all cowans; he promises to subdue hi s passions, by which means he is united to virtue, and by his regularity of life, demonstrates what he proposes. This is figured to him by the steps that he takes in approaching the altar; the symbolic meaning of wh ich is the separation of the firmament from the earth and water on the second day of creation. (The charge proceeds by giving a figurative interpretation of the ceremonies, et c., of the first and second part of the third degree, which I pass over as uninteresting to my readers, and [Pg 200] commence with an interpretation which will be as novel to the Craft of the lower grades as to the cowans, or non-initiated.) In the Master's degree is represented the assassi nation of Hiram by false brethren. This ought to put us in mind of the fate of Adam, occasioned by perverseness in his disobeying his great and awful Creator. The symbolic mystery of the death of Hiram Abiff represents to us that of the Messiah; for the three blows which were given to Hiram Abiff, at the three gates of the temple, allude to the three points of c ondemnation against Christ, at the High Priest's Caiphas, Herod, and Pilate. It was from the last that he was led to that most violent and ex cruciating death. The said three blows with the square, gauge, and gave l are symbols of the blow on the cheek, the flagellation, and the crown of thorns. The brethr en assembled around the tomb of Hiram, is a representation of the disciples lame nting the death of Christ on the cross. The Master's word, which is said to be lost, since the death of Hiram Abi ff, is the same that Christ pronounced on the cross, and which the Jews did not comprehend, \"Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani,\" \"my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me! have pity on and forgive my enemies.\"—Instead of which words were substituted, M. B. N. (Mac-be-nac ), which, in Arabian, signifies, \"T he son of the widow is dead.\" The false brethren represent Judas Iscariot, who so ld Christ. The red collar worn by the Grand Elect Perfect and Sublime Masons, calls to remembrance the blood of Christ. The sprig of cassia is the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"figure of the cross, because of this wood was the cross made. The captivity of the Grand Elect and Sublime Masons (i.e., by the Chaldeans), shows us the persecution of the Ch ristian religion under the Roman emperors, and its liberty under Constantin e the Great. It also calls to our remembrance the persecution of the Templars, and the situation of Jacques De Molay, who, lying in irons nearly seven years, at the end of which our worthy Grand Master was burnt alive with his four companions, on the eleventh of March, 1314, creating pity and tears in the people, who saw him die with firmness and heroic constancy, sealing his innocence with his blood. My dear brother, in passing to the degree of Pe rfect Master, in which you shed tears at the tomb of Hiram Abiff, and in some other degrees, has not your heart been led to revenge? Has not the crime of Jubelum Akirop been represented in the most hideous light?—Would it be unjust to compare the conduct of Philip the Fair to his, and the infamous accusers of the Templars, to the two ruffians who were accomplices with Akirop? Do they not kindle in your heart an equal aversion? The different stages you have traveled, and the time you have taken in learning these histor ical events, no doubt, will lead you to make the proper ap plications; and by the degree of Master Elect and Kadosh, you are properly disposed to fulfil all your engagements, and to bear an implacable hatred to the Knights of Malta, and to avenge the death of Jacques De Molay. Your extensive acquaintance with symbolic Masonry, which you have attained by your discretion, leaves you nothing more to desire here. You see, my dear brother, how, and by whom, Masonry has come to us. You are to endeavor by every just means to regain our rights, and to remember that we are joined by a society of men, whose courage, merit, and [Pg 201] good conduct, hold out to us that rank that birth alone gave to our ancestors. You are now on the same level with th em. Avoid every evil by keeping your obligations, and carefully conceal from the vulgar what you are, and wait that happy moment when we all shall be reunited under the same Sovereign in the mansions of eternal bliss. Let us imitate the example of our Grand Master, Jaques De Molay, who to the end put his hope in God, and at his last dying moments ended his life sayi ng, \"Spes mea in Deo est!\" O BLIGATION . —I do, of my own free will and accord, in the presence of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and this consistory of Sovereign Princes of the Royal S ecret, or Knights of St. Andrew, faithful guardians of the faithful treasure; most solemnly vow and swear, under all the different penalties of my former obligations, that I will neve r directly or indirectly reveal or make known to any person or persons whatsoever, any or the leas t part of this Royal degree, unless to one duly qualified in the body of a re gularly constituted Consistory of th e same, or to him or them whom I shall find such after strict and due trial.

The following is the form of a petition used by a candidate; but a worthy candidate will not be rejected for the want of formality in his petition. To the Worshipful Master, Wardens, and Brethren of Lodge No. ——, of Free and Accepted Masons. The subscriber, residing in ——, of lawful age, and by occupation a ——, begs leave to state that, unbiassed by friends, and uninfluenced by mercenary motives, he freely and voluntarily offers himself a candidate for the mysteries of Masonry, and that he is prompt to solicit this privilege by a favorable opinion conceived of the institution, a desire of knowle dge, and a sincere wish of being serviceable to his fellow-creatures. Should his petition be grante d, he will cheerfully conform to all the ancient established usages and customs of the Fraternity. (Signed) A. B. [2] In many Lodges this is put in the form of a question, thus: \"Are you willing to take an obligation upon you that does not affect your politics or relig ion?\" The promise \"to conform,\" made before entering the Lodge, the \"assurance that the oath is not to interfere with their political or religious principles\" and the manner the obligation is administ ered, only two or three words being repeated at a time, consequently not fully understood, are among the reasons which have led many great and good men to take oaths incompatible with the laws of God and our country.

In the degrees of knighthood the distance is forty miles. [4] In some Lodges the Master takes the candidate by the Master's grip and says, \"Brother, you will please rise,\" assisting him. [5] There is much diversity of opinion among Masons respecting this word; some insist that G IBLEM is the right word; others, that G IBELUM is the right word; the latter word was rejected, because it was used by \"Jachin and Boaz.\" [6] This charge is frequently omitted when conferring the degree on a candidate, but never when really installing a Master of a Lodge. [7] Here the brethren divest themselves of their jewels, sashes, aprons, etc. [8] The ark, which had been carried by two brethren in the procession, is here placed on the altar.

[11] At the words, \"For He is good,\" the Most Excellent Master, who is High Priest of the Chapter, kneels and joins hands with the rest; they all then re peat in concert the words, \"For He is good, for His mercy endureth forever\" six times, each time bowing their heads low towards the floor. [12] There is a great difference in the manner of givi ng the Royal Arch word in the different Chapters. Sometimes it is given at the opening, as above stated; sometimes they commence with the word G OD , each one pronouncing a letter of it in succession, un til they have each pronounced every letter of the word, then the word J EHOVAH , a syllable at a time, and then the word J AHBUHLUN as described. There"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"are also Chapters in which the latter word is not known, and there are others in which the word is not given at all at opening. [13] This clause is sometimes made a distinct point in the obligation in the following form, viz.: Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will vo te for a companion Royal Arch Mason before any other of equal qualifications; and in some Chapters both are left out of the obligation. [14] In some Chapters this is administered: All the secrets of a companion without exception. [15] This is frequently represented in this manner: Wh en the person reading comes to that part where it says, \"God called to him out of the midst of the bush and said,\" etc., he stops reading, and a person behind the bushes calls out, \"Moses, Moses.\" The c onductor answers, \"Here am I.\" The person behind the bush then says, \"Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standeth is holy ground (his shoes are then slipped off). Moreover, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" The person fi rst reading then says, \"And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\" At these words the bandage is placed over the candidate's eyes. [16] By this tremendous imprecation, the candidate, of his \"own free will and accord,\" volunteers (in case of a violation) to come forth to the resurrection of damnation and receive the sentence, \"Depart thou accursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\" [17] See the Apocryphal books, 1 Esdras, chapters iii. and iv.

HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE KIDNAPPING OF WILLIAM MORGAN. Captain Morgan was born in Virginia, and was a mason by trade. He commenced the business of a brewer at York, Upper Canada, in 1821, but havi ng lost all his property by fire, he removed to New York State, and worked at his trade both in Rochester and Batavia. In the year 1826 rumors were heard that Morgan, in connection with othe r persons, was preparing and intended to publish a book which would reveal the secrets of Freemasonr y, and an excitement of some kind existed in relation to the publication of th e book. In the month of September he was seized under feigned process of the law, in the day time, in the village of Batavia, and forcibly carried to Canandaigua. Captain Morgan was at this tim e getting ready his book, which purport ed to reveal the secrets of Freemasonry. This contemplated publication excited th e alarm of the fraternity, and numbers of its members were heard to say that it should be suppr essed at all events. Meet ings of delegates from the different Lodges in the Western counties has b een held to devise means for most effectually preventing the publication. The zealous members of the fraternity were angry, excited, and alarmed, and occasionally individuals threw out dark and desperate threats. About this time an incendiary attempt was made to fire the office of Col. Miller, the publisher of the book. The gang who seized Morgan at Batavia were Masons. They took him to Canandaigua; after a mock trial he was discharged, but was immediately arrested and committed to prison on a debt. The next night, in the absence of the jailer, he was released from prison by the pretended friendship of a false and hollow-hearted brother Mason. Upon leaving the pr ison door he was seized in the streets of Canandaigua, and notwithstanding his cries of murder , he was thrust with ruffian violence into a carriage prepared for that purpose. At Batavia he had b een torn from his home—from his wife and"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"infant children. At Canandaigua he was falsely beguiled from the safe custody of the law, and was forcibly carried, by relays of horses, through a thickly populated country, in the space of little more than twenty-four hours, to the distance of one hundr ed and fifteen miles, and secured as a prisoner in the magazine of Fort Niagara. This was clearl y proved on the trial of persons concerned in the outrage, and who were found guilty and [Pg 203] sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. The fate of Captain Morgan was never known, but it is supposed he was taken out into the lake, where his throat was cut, and his body sunken fifty fathoms in water. About the same time, Col. David C. Miller, the publisher of the book, wa s also seized, in Batavia, under the color of legal process, and taken to Le Roy. The avowed inte ntion of Col. Miller's seizure was to take him where Morgan was—and where that was may be best gathered from the impious declaration of one of the conspirators, James Ganson, for seve ral years a member of our Legi slature—that \"he was put where he would stay put until God should call for him. \" Miller was, however, set at liberty, as the inhabitants of Le Roy interfered with the schemes of his kidnappers . He soon after put to press the first part of the volume which is here presented to the public. Additions have been made to Captain Morgan's revelations, from time to time, until we are now able to make public all the Masonic degrees of any note or interest, entered into by modern Freemasons.
