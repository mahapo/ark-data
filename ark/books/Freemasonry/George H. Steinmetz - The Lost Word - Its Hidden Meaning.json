The orthodox Christian thinking of most Western peoples in general and English speaking peo- ples in particular also contributes to the difficulty. Their basic understanding of the words necessarily employed is so rooted -in their orthodox associations that the subtle changes in meaning are not readily ac- cepted by the mind.

Occult philosophy conceives man as a special crea- tion of the Deity, composed of the material( the phys- ical body), the psychical (the self conscious mind) and the spiritual (the living Something, the spark, immortal man,- THE GOD WITHIN! ). Material science postulates man as a part of the general crea- tion, having evolved to his present self consciousness from a lower form of life. The Hebrew-Christian Bible is in accord with the ancient philosophy ( from . which it derives) in claiming man to be a special crea- tion. The Bible is not at variance with ancient teach- ing, when properly understood, but is an abridged edition of that philosophy; it does not resort to the lengthy detail of some of the Eastern Sacred Books7 but it in no wise contradicts those details.

The declara- tion is made that the “Holy Bible is the Great Light of Masonry” and Masonry’s initiates are admonished to: “With reverence study and obey the laws which Thou hast given us in Thy Holy Word.” Freema- . sonry proclaims : “The Holy Bible is given us as the rule and guide of our faith and practice.” And sol- emnly informs its candidates that: “The Bible is ded- icated to God because it is His inestimable gift to Man.” And that, “so should we * * * endeavor to erect our spir&ual building in accordance with the designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Great Book of Nature and Revela- tion, which is. our spiritual, moral and Masonic Tres- tle Board.” ’ Lest any misunderstanding arise in the mind of the reader because of these repeated references to the “Holy Bible,” it should be noted that substitution of the “Holy Bible” for the ‘Volume of the Sacred Law” is a modern adaptation of the English speaking Lodge.

Were moral and ethical enlightenment its only merit to the Free- mason, he need not “study” it. The entire worth of the Bible as a guide to morals and ethics is contained ‘in the I decalogue, the “eleventh commandment”- “‘love thy neighbor as thyself” 2 and the “Golden Rule”- “And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.” 3 These could easily have been incorporated into the Masonic Ritual, sav- ing the initiate the labor of seeking them out for him- self, for what more can one, learn of morals and ethics throughout the whole of the Bible, and what more is taught of them throughout the whole of Masonry?

That discovery is that one must “ask and seek” within the Bible where he shall attain to that light which cannot be conferred in the Lodge. Therein is discovered that “SOMETHING” which it is in- tended shall be discovered: the truth of man himself, the reason for his existence, his ultimate goal, and instructions for attaining it.

Those interpretations actually lead one away from the truth purposely,-as the mother bird, simulat- ing a broken wing, flutters away before the intruder and leads him from her hidden brood. Masonry casts no pearls before the swine; these secrets are too valu- able to offer to anyone cheaply. The first degree of Freemasonry treats of the mate- rial and physical. The second degree deals with the psychical and mental. The third degree is the apex, the culmination of its teaching and wholly spiritual. This same teaching, dealing with the three planes of being upon and in which component man operates, is elucidated repetitiously throughout the Bible. It is there related historically; it is related in allegory whereby it is likewise “veiled,” and it is “illustrated” by symbols. It is revealed in a grand theme of which the entire Bible may be said to represent a cycle, and it is concealed in separate accounts which may be termed “cycles within a cycle.” While apparently repetitious, each different account brings out some phase not covered by other recitals, and like a spiral is found to be on a continuing higher plane.

Within the great cycle the three degrees are depicted again and again in lesser cycles, in various individual narratives. Prob- ably the most enlightening exposition, and the one most nearly paralleling the Masonic ritual, is the story of the three Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which will be discussed in detail in a subse- quent chapter. It is the purpose of this work to study the correla- tion and discover the analogy between the allegory and symbolism of Freemasonry and the allegory and symbolism of the Bible as they support and enlarge on the Masonic philosophy.

Therefore, if *your committee circulates any informa- tion at all, it must be in addition to, subtraction from, or modification of the only authorized doctrine of Grand Lodge, viz., the ritual. Hence, we have the anomaly of a Committee officially and solemnly au- thorized to disseminate unauthorized materials.” ’ Here is the difficulty clearly realized “and acknowl- edged by this Committee. Officially, the ritual is “all there is,” and no Grand Lodge will go beyond that fact and attempt to define the teachings of Masonry, nor will any Grand Lodge (to my knowledge) admit the existence of the Secret Doctrine which is so openly discussed and written about by Masonic students and authorities on Masonic symbolism. This attitude it- self might well be termed one of the “Mysteries of Freemasonry.” The same is true of the “Landmarks of Freemasonry.” Practically every Jurisdiction in the United States enumerates different “Landmarks” or accepts those listed by Mackey, entirely overlook- ing the learned discourses of Brothers Silas Shepherd and Roscoe Pound. - 2 California Grand Lodge Proceedings for 1947.

He has obtained all the “RIGHTS” (prerogatives), “LIGHTS” (enlightenment) $ and “BENEFITS” (advantages) which can be conferred upon him in a Lodge. Henceforth he must “ask, seek, and knock” ; he must pray (do) for himself.

Firstly, because there are those, in the Order, who in their lack of knowledge claim that it does not exist; secondly, because the seeking Ma- son can gain no further light than is shed by the ritual itself, until he starts his quest for the REAL SE- CRETS of the hidden Mysteries of Freemasonry- and they are found WITHIN THE SECRET DOC- TRINE! How important this is considered by Brother Waite is evidenced by the following: “1 have followed the Secret Tradition in its development through several paths, within and outside of Masonry. That there is a meaning behind the Tradition I am entirely certain, though it is of symbolism or allegory after its own manner and within its own measures, even as Masonry is, The great BOOK OF THE ZOHAR contains the whole doctrine of the Hidden Word and of the circumstances under which it shall be restored on the coming of Israel out of exile in the day of Messiah.” 4 Lest it be thought by some that we are attributing deeper meaning to Masonic teaching than exists or was intended by its molders we quote further from Brother’ Waite: “ It has been recognized throughout that there is a higher mind of Masonry, that a wider meaning attaches to its chief allegory than that which appears on the surface, and that the essential great- 4 Emblematic Freemasonry.

There is no inclination to question the fact that our modern Lodges, AS OR- GANIZATIONS, owe their origin to these Operative Lodges, but what of the esoteric teaching? “Are we to believe that these craftsmen of the medieval guilds, most of whom were actually illiterate, conceived an entire philosophy such as Freemasonry, and then, with consummate cunning, concealed it beneath a complicated system of symbolism and allegory?” 6 The obvious answer to the question is that they did not. Some Masonic authorities are of the opinion that the esoteric teaching and symbology were superim- posed on the ready-at-hand organization of Operative Masons by the “Gentlemen,” the Speculative Masons who were at the time being admitted to the Operative Lodges; men like Ashmole, Fludd and Bacon who were students of philosophy. Some of them are also known to have been members of the Rosicrucian Or- der. The similarity of Modern Masonic and Rosicru- ‘Ibid. Page 253, ‘Freemasonry Its Hidden Meaning.

There is ample reason to suspect that modern Free- masonry was profoundly influenced by, if not actually the outgrowth of, Rosicrucianism and Bacon’s Secret Society. YIts symbolism is undoubtedly permeated with Bacon’s two great ideals: universal education and universal democracy.” 8 Of Fludd, Hall says: “DeQuincey considers Robert _ Fludd to be the immediate father of Freemasonry. (See The Rosicrucians and Freemasons.) Arthur Ed- ward Waite considers Fludd as second to none of the disciples of Paracelsus, even going so far as to declare that Fludd far surpassed his master. He further ’ “Another curious link in the chain of circumstances which binds the Royal Society to the esoteric tradition is suggested by Hugh B. C. Pol- lard: ‘We find in association with it (the Royal Society) not only Boyle, but Sir Christopher Wren, Sir Robert Moray, Elias Ashmole, and Locke. These are not only the most important names in the early Royal SO- ciety, but also in English Freemasonry. Sir Robert Moray, who was the driving force behind the Royal Society, had entered the Rosicrucian Fraternity in 1641, and was also the driving force in Speculative Free- masonry. Prior to this period we have no satisfactory trace of any Masonic organization other than purely operative or guild concerns. There is no trace of any person of quality in association with these . minor guild Mysteries, yet between 1630 and 1660 we find people of social eminence-and it was a day when social-caste rules were binding -enrolled in Masonic organizations.’ ” The Adepts.

Sir Francis Bacon knew the true secret of Masonic origin and there is reason to suspect that he concealed this knowledge in cipher and cryptogram. Bacon is not to be regarded solely as a man but rather as the focal point between an invisible institution and \\ a world which was never able to distinguish between the messenger and the message which he promulgated. This secret society, having rediscovered the lost wis-’ dom of the ages and fearing that the knowledge might be lost again, perpetuated it in two ways: (I) By an organization (Freemasonry) to the initiates of which it revealed its wisdom in the form of symbols; ( 2) by embodying its arcana in the literature of the day by means of cunningly contrived ciphers and enigmas.

One or more meanings were usually quite obvious and known to initiate and profane alike with no attempt at secrecy. The more recondite meanings were known only to the initiates and even these were expanded and amplified only as the neophyte advanced in his studies and was admitted to the higher *grades (degrees). Insofar as we now know, the Mysteries did not solicit membership nor attempt to proselytize. It is true they apparently taught morals and ethics to the multitude, inasmuch as the so-called “Pagan” priests were initiates and they promulgated the exoteric phi- losophy of the Mysteries in their temples. But the initiation and esoteric teaching were exclusively for him who, of his own free will and accord, presented himself as a candidate for the Mysteries. Only such were admitted as were deemed worthy and well qualified, of good moral and ethical standing and of an intelligence capable of grasping the esoteric teaching, and then only after a due process of prep- aration.

He was acquainted with the philosophy of the Mysteries, given a liberal education in the then recognized sci- ences and finally reached a stage of enlightenment where he had a logical, intellectual ,foundation upon which to erect the superstructure of his “faith and practice.” + The next grade dealt with the spiritual. Little is gleaned from the ancient writers relative to the higher grades, for all initiates were under solemn vows of secrecy.

Darwin, one of the foremost ad- vocates of the theory, conceived a hypothetical inter- mediate form, a common ancestor from which the anthropoid ape and man diverged, but the very in- ability of science to find any trace or remains of such a creature has been responsible for the introduction into the English language of the phrase: “the missing link.” An axiom of biology is that the individual develop- ment recapitulates the life history of the species.

Gold, being the color of the Sun, was considered a sacred metal by the ancients; as such it came to be used as a symbol of the spiritual. Brass, being sim- ilar in appearance to gold, and more plentiful then as now, was frequently substituted for gold, and so par- took of the same symbolical significance. Some time in the dim past the ancients apparently had knowl- edge of the atomic structure of metals and attributed their various densities to their different rates of vi- bration.

Returning to the discussion of the three techniques enumerated: the first of these is the use of a name to describe a person, place or thing.

In most instances the Bible relates the specific circumstances and adds: “Therefore he was called,” etc. In some cases the explanation given is the ENTIRE reason; in others it is merely the RA- TIONAL explanation, and there is a hidden meaning in the name not apparent in the purported explana- tion. Reuben and Joseph are two examples where the “rational” explanation offered in the Bible appears to be the sole reason for bestowing the names. Of Reu- ben the Bible states: “And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated; he opened her womb.” ‘I Upon the birth of her first-born Leah was overjoyed and named him “Reuben” -“to see a son” or “behold, a son.” A very natural choice of name for a woman who had longed for a son and prayed God to bless her with one. In view of the great desire of the ancients for off- spring, especially sons, it is not difficult to understand the attitude of Rachel when we come to consider her case. She had failed to bear a son to her husband and had seen her sister and rival presenting him with sons. She prays God that she too may have a son, and upon 7 Genesis XXIX: 31. The word “hated” conveys the wrong impres- sion, according to Leeser- (commentary on this verse in his translation of the Bible)--” This means, not absolutely hated, but neglected, less loved than the other.” In another connection it is stated “Jacob LOVED Rachel”; perhaps this is an intentional “allegorical” exaggeration for the sake of emphasis."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"52 THE LOST WORD-ITS HIDDEN MEANING his birth she names him Cd Joseph”- (‘He will add” or “God will add.” Thus she expresses her gratitude and her faith in God who answered her prayer, faith that he will “add” yet other sons to her. Other examples of the descriptive name connected with the incident of birth are the names of Jacob and Esau. The Bible recites: “And when her (Rebekah’s) days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob.” * Both names are descriptive of ap- pearance or an event. Esau is described as “red, all over like an hairy garment.” His name is doubly de- scriptive.” a Genesis XXV: 24, 25, 26, Jacob means “Taking hold of the heel, also supplanter, layer of snares.” Note, the “taking hold of the heel” describes the circumstances of birth whereas the “supplanter, layer of snares” is apparently prophetic. This meaning may well have been attributed, after the fact, rather than to have had such’connotation at the time the name was given the infant Jacob. We have a modern example of such usage in the name “Quisling” to describe a despicable traitor, The name had no such original meaning, but came to have the connotation after one by that name became notorious for his traitorous conduct. ‘There seems to be some confusion in the Bible regarding Esau’s name. In some places he is called “Edom” and his descendents are called “Edomites.” Adam in Hebrew is DlN. Edom is blti. It is to be noted they are the same.

These are descriptive of the physical make-up but also carry an implication of derision. Esau may have originally been used in this sense as descriptive of a rough, ruddy, hairy individual, but it appears that in the Bible the name is used with the individual, while the other name “Edom” is more generally used with regard to his posterity.

It was in vogue among the Egyptians from whom the Jews doubtless acquired the custom during their long sojourn in that land. Pharaoh changed Joseph’s name to “Zaphnath-paaneah.” To 11 John I: 47.

If further evidence is required to substantiate the Egyptian origin of this custom, it is readily at hand in an incident of purely Egyptian history, entirely apart from the Bible or any connection with the Jews. The Pharaoh Amenhotep IV is credited with being the founder of the monotheistic religion and worship of Aton.

Briefly, the story to which he alludes is as follows: Isis longs for the power which will be hers if she can discover the secret name of Ra. She takes some of the god’s spittle and mixes it with earth, molding the resultant mud into a serpent, which she places1 in the path along which Ra will walk. The serpent stings him and, being poisoned, Ra calls all the gods and goddesses to him and says: “I am a prince, the son of a prince, the divine seed of a god. My father , devised my name; my father and my mother gave me my name, and it has remained hidden in my body since my birth 24 that no magician might have power over me.” This conversation between the gods continues for a time during which Ra’s poisoned condition deteri- orates. Isis entreats Ra to tell her his true name, say- ing: “Tell me thy name, divine father, for the man. 23 The Golden Bough.

Ra is immediately restored to health and Isis is the possessor of the secret name and with it the magical powers such possession bestows. With a realization of the historically proven fact of a long sojourn by the Jews in Egypt, at some time, even though authorities are not agreed on the exact date, and the opportunity thus given them to become familiar with the Egyptian allegories such as the one just related, there can remain little doubt as to the origin of many of the allegories and traditions of the Jews, particularly the concept of the hidden name of Deity. From India comes yet another hypothesis in con- nection with the secret name of Deity which must be considered. Man with his finite mind cannot com- prehend the Infinite, hence he cannot %ame” God, that is, he canot apply a descriptive name to some- thing he cannot understand.

Upon being provided (presumably by Moses) with ancestors as ancient as those of the Egyptians, and a god of their own, who had likewise been the peculiar god of those ancestors, the Jews became instilled with race-consciousness and pride.

The Kabalist states: “Ten is the most perfect num- ber because it includes unity which created every- thing, and zero, symbol of matter and chaos whence everything emerged. By disregarding the zero, the one remains unchanged.” If this procedure is adopted in connection with the four hundred and thirty (430) years of the Egyptian captivity there remains forty three (43 ) or four (4) and three (3).

God then takes Moses to the top of Mount Pisgah and shows him the Promised Land, but in- forms him : “I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.“” This is symbolical of the fact that neither the material nor the psychical can actually “enter” into the spiritual. As we see Moses on the “Mountain Top” gazing at the distant “Promised Land,” so we see Humanity on the intellectual “heights” from which the “spiritual” is discernible as a concept but not acquired as an ex- perience.

However, Horus combines the attributes of his TWO parents in ONE being, just as Jacob combines the, attributes of both his Grandfather and his Father in ONE individual. Horus fought, and overcame Set, the principle of evil, which is an allegorical depiction of man striving with and overcoming his lower nature. The story of Jacob takes a slightly different turn, but the end results are the same. Jacob wrestled with an “angel” rather than strove with the evil principle, but out of his wrestling emerged the recognition of his own divinity, which is but another way of saying he “overcame his lower nature.” All such allegories are changed somewhat to fit peoples and circum- stances and they cannot be expected to agree in minute detail, but the “theme” is present. It is the writer’s personal opinion that the entire story of the Patriarchs was “borrowed” from the Egyptians; that it is the “Hebrew version” of the tale of Osiris, Isis, and Horus, with Osiris somewhat confused with Ra, and Isis changed to the masculine Isaac, who in spite of the change retains the feminine symbology.

KRISHNA The story of Krishna is recounted in the Vedas of the Hindus. These Sacred Books are said to have been committed to written form as early as 1500 B.C., but some occultists claim the Vedas are,50,000 years old. We need not here enter into that contro- versy and it is merely mentioned to focus attention on their admitted antiquity. Krishna was born of the virgin Devaki. The Ath- arva-Veda says : “As Devaki wandered in the forest, voices sang from behind the foliage: ‘hail to thee, glorious Devaki ! That pure fluid, emanating from the mighty soul of all things, shall come, crowned with light, and the stars shall pale before its splen- dour. It shall come, and life shall challenge death. It shall restore youth to all beings. It shall come sweeter than’ honey, purer than the spotless lamb 1 or the mouth of a virgin. And all hearts shall be transported with raptures of love.

Seeing herself overshadowed by the Spirit f the Universe, Devaki lost consciousness and con- ceived the Divine Child.” On recovering conscious- ness a voice informed her : “thou has conceived in purity of heart and divine love. Thou shalt give birth to a son, destined to be the savior of the world.” Shortly after the birth of Krishna his mother is forced to flee, with her infant, from the kingdom of King Kansa, her uncle, to escape his murderous in- tentions. It seems there existed a prophecy that De- vaki should give birth to a son who would grow to manhood, overcome King Kansa and ascend his throne. As Kansa had killed seven previous children of Devaki’s she remained in hiding upon the birth of Krishna.2 Being unable to find Devaki and the babe, ‘It is not our intention to herein write a commentary on Hindu philosophy but the apparent discrepancy of the ‘6Virgin” Devaki having given birth to other children seems needful of explanation. The previous children were all of miraculous conception by “The Spirit of the Uni- verse” hence she remained a Virgin in the respect she had never ex- perienced carnal intercourse. The epic of Krishna in the Vedas is sustained allegory. King Kansa, Devaki and for that matter Krishna are all symbolic of “forces” and “principles.” The “Seven Sons of Devaki” born before Krishna and murdered by Kansa are the seven centers of energy evolved or rendered objective by the action of ‘CFohat” upon the one element. Blavatsky explains: “They are in truth the Sephiroth of the Kabalists ; the ‘seven gifts of the Holy Ghost’ in the Christian system ; and in a mystical sense, the seven children or sons of Devaki killed before the birth of Krishna by Kansa.

In that day shalt thou kill the bull and crush the serpent’s head.” 3 The narrative continues with the story of Krishna’s life and teaching, finally relating that he allowed him- self to be captured by his enemies, bound to a tree and shot with an arrow.

It is clearly stated that only through the death of Krishna can humanity be saved, and Krishna himself is quoted as informing his followers that he must sacrifice him- self for the benefit of mankind that they might be “saved” through his death.

These animals are just as conscious of their surroundings and environment as is man. They are conscious of their own limbs and, to all appearances, know them to be a part of them- selves. Many persons credit these higher animals with the ability to think, and cite numerous instances where they have shown remarkable intelligence. Un- doubtedly they do think, to a degree, but not as man thinks, and certainly no one would go so far as to claim for them the ability to reason in the abstract. Man possesses this same simple consciousness, but in addition he experiences another and higher form of consciousness which we call Self Consciousness. Self Conscious man not only can think objectively, but he can think subjectively as well, he can reason in the abstract, and he can even analyze his own thoughts. Dr. Bucke asserts that Cosmic Consciousness is a third form “which is as far above Self Consciousness l Comic Consciousness.

The mystics of many ages and many peo- ples speak the same language and use the same words. This is the first and most important thing that speaks for the reality of the mystical experience. Next is the complete harmony of data regarding such experience with the theoretically deduced conditions of the world causes; the sensation of the unity of all, so charac- teristic of mysticism ; a new sensation of time, the sense of infinity; joy or horror ; knowledge of the whole in the part; infinite life and infinite conscious- ness.

Paul, the mystic, again says: “TO be spiritually minded is life and peace.” This surely cannot refer to “after-death.” This IS EXACTLY THE SAME DESCRIPTION of this experience given by modern writers. Again he speaks of “the glory which shall be revealed in us,” comparing it with the “present condition.” Nor is this referring to an “hereafter,” but obviously describing a possible attainment in the mortal flesh. He continues: “the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.” From all others have said of Cosmic Con- sciousness, Paul’s “manifestation of the sons of God” must be the dawning of spiritual cognition in the in- dividual, and again there is nothing to indicate he is speaking of a post-mortem state.

Thus diverse authorities give ample evidence of the reality of the state of consciousness we are investigat- ing. They leave no question of the actuality; of the fact that man has and can experience an exaltation or spiritual illumination far above the self-conscious experience of the average individual. The questions yet unanswered are : Is the acquisition of this con- sciousness a happenstance of evolution, or can it be voluntarily and knowingly acquired by any individ- ual desiring it?

We may only judge, from the absence of any in- formation to the contrary, that Dr. Bucke considers Cosmic Consciousness a product of evolution and not something to be acquired through the conscious effort of the individual. Just as the race began with simple consciousness and evolved to the acquisition of self consciousness, he postulates it to be the plan of the Supreme Architect that the entire race eventually evolve to Cosmic Consciousness.

Likewise a few individuals have appeared possessed of Cosmic Consciousness, indicating the inherent po- tential in the race and suggesting that all will even- tually evolve to that state. , While we agree with his conclusion, that all will eventually evolve to that state, he leaves an opening in his argument of which the skeptic will be quick to take advantage. His analogy is incorrect, for while a race possessed of but simple consciousness, not hav- ing an objective consciousness, could but wait for evolution to advance it to the stage of self conscious- ness, once that state is acquired and the self conscious individual ing, he can which the to do for becomes capable of thinking and reason- accomplish that Z.&Z his self consciousness simple conscious need wait for evolution them.

He can now (presumably) think for himself, he has acquired a will and with it the freedom of choice, and he must thereafter do for himself that which previously was done for him. The fallacy, in fact the outstanding weakness, in Dr. Bucke’s theory is that he has overlooked the an- cient axiom that “NATURE UNAIDED FAILS!” As we observe, Dr. Bucke does not allow, in his theory, for the conscious effort of the individual in acquiring Cosmic Consciousness without waiting for the natural results of evolution. If he is correct, that it cannot be acquired, then obviously it cannot be the long lost word of the Master’s degree, for all Masonic philosophy is builded upon the premise of a search for a lost word, or knowledge, OR STATE OF BE- ING; that such knowledge was at, one time at man’s disposal, and that IT WILL BE FOUND AGAIN, else we are but made ridiculous when we are given a “substitute” to be used “until future generations shall discover the right.” It is useless to search for a condition, or state of being which can only come about through natural ev- olution.

Ouspensky is likewise critical of this view, although not from the Masonic standpoint, in which he evinces no interest in Tertium Organurn. He calls attention to certain imperfections in the book, Cosmic Con- sciousness, arising from what he terms a strange in- decisiveness of Dr. Bucke’s-“from his timidity in asserting the dominant significance of the NEW CONSCIOUSNESS.” He continues his criticism: “We may say further with regard to Dr. Bucke’s en- tire book, that touching the idea of the natural growth of consciousness, he does not notice that these facul- ties do not unfold themselves perforce: conscious work on them is necessary. And he does not dwell at all on conscious efforts in this direction, on the idea of the CULTURE of cosmic consciousness. Mean- while there exists a whole series of psychological teachings (occultism, yoga, etc.) and a large litera- ture having in view a systematic culture of the higher consciousness. Dr. Bucke does not remark this, and insists upon the idea of natural growth, although he himself several times touches upon the culture of con- sciousness. * * * Dr Bucke, like many others, does not pay sufficient attention to the PRESENT.

Man can do something about it without waiting with folded hands until evolution brings it about. Here is the “rod” of the Caduceus, the “straight and narrow path” which leads to Mastership, rather than the winding paths of the entwined serpents which he without knowledge must travel.

G. Jung, writing of the mandalas drawn by some of his patients, states: “In the light of such historical parallels the mandala either symbolizes the divine being, hitherto hidden and dormant in the body and now extracted and revivified, or it symbolizes the ves- sel or the room in which the transformation of man into a divine being takes place.” 6 Ytn most of the religions of the ancient world, the relation between the soul and God has been repre- sented as a return of the soul to God. A yearning for God, a kind of divine home-sickness, finds expression in most religions. But the road that is to lead us home, and the reception which the soul may expect in the Father’s house, have been represented in very different ways, in different countries and different lan- guages. ‘The Tarot.

That beatitude requires no bridges, it requires knowl- edge only, knowledge of the necessary unity of what is divine in man with what is divine in God.7 The Brahmins call it self-knowledge, that is to say, the knowledge that our true self, if it is anything, can only be that Self which is All in All, and beside which there is nothing else. Sometimes this conception of the intimate relation between the human and the di- vine natures comes in suddenly, as the result of un- explained intuition or self-recollection.

Ward says: ““The left knee being made bare is an interesting and ancient custom in initiation rites. The reason why the knee should be bare is in order that the naked flesh may come into contact with ‘pjlother Earth when the obli- gation is taken. We do not know whether the candi- date in the Hung Rite kneels only on this knee, if this is so it would explain why only one knee has to be bare. But as in the Chinese painting reproduced in this book the candidates are kneeling on both knees it would be unsafe to be too dogmatic on the point, although it is quite possible that the artist made them appear thus in order not to disclose the peculiar way in which they knelt.

Among members of the Triad Society it con- stitutes a sign of recognitiori, for they are instructed to enter the house of another brother left foot first. The explanation of the custom probably dates back to very primitive times. In ancient mythology the Preserver is always depicted as trampling with his left foot on the Serpent of Evil. Thus Horus plants his left foot on the Serpent Apepi, in Ancient Egypt. This monster represents Spiritual Evil, e.g. the Devil. It also specifically refers to ignorance, as in the In- dian legend of Krishna trampling on the five-headed cobra. Kali also did the same with the Giant she slew. The five-headed cobra represents the Five Senses, which according to that allegory must be cleansed from every evil thought. In Mediaeval pic- tures of the Harrowing of Hell Christ is usually de- picted as planting His left foot on the great dragon.” Ward goes on to say that further light is shed on 2 See The Mung Society.

Again quot- ing directly from Ward: “It will also be remembered that among the ancient races of Greece and Rome the left was the unlucky side, hence our word ‘sinister.’ The left is also regarded as the feminine side. “From these facts we perceive that by stepping off left foot first the Candidate (in the Hung Society) is symbolically taught to trample underfoot the powers of evil, and it is intended that the left foot should imply ill-luck to the Demon. The feminine aspect of the action shows that the candidate is a passive mem- ber of the assembly into which he is being admitted and not an active one. like the Officers.” 3 The candidate is presented with a lambskin apron “because the lamb has in all ages been deemed an emblem of innocence.” True, exoterically, but here is a surface exposure of that (‘vein of evidence” which we stated runs through the three degrees.

Approximately every twenty- two hundred years, due to the precession of the equi- noxes, the sun enters the adjoining sign of the zodiac from that which it had occupied. The sun, having traveled through the sign of Taurus (the Bull), en- tered the sign of Aries (the Celestial Lamb). Astro- logically this is referred to as the beginning of a new dispensation. Some occult students state this is sym- bolized by the exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt. Egypt was the land where the Bull was wor- shipped, and as the sun passed out of Taurus and into Aries it ushered in the new dispensation of the wor- ship of the Celestial Lamb; in a broad sense, the Lamb of God -“which taketh away the sins of the world.” Nor has Christianity any exclusive preroga- tive to this symbolism, for, as we have seen, the anal- ogy of the lamb with purity and the virgin birth of a savior is a myth which predates the Christian era 7by thousands of years.

Whatever they may signify at other times, here they inform of the three- fold composition of the complete man, Body, Soul and Spirit, primarily; and secondarily to the three planes of consciousness peculiar to these three planes of being. The aspirant then ascends the Five Steps representative, it is said, of the five human senses and the five orkl’ers of architecture. Note carefully the emphasis of the importance of but three. Only three orders of architecture are admittedly original, the other two being combinations of the three, and they -“having nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally.” It is significant that the three senses deemed the most important are those by which the vast majority of impressions are conveyed to the mind. It is evident that upon the plane of simple consciousness the individual must depend entirely upon the senses for his impressions of the material world, and to a large degree this is true of the self conscious. Thus mounting the Five Steps is symbolic of “getting above,” of reaching a level where this dependence no longer exists."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"212 THE LOST WORD-ITS HIDDEN MEANING The necessity of rising, of getting above the phys- ical senses, is apparent if we but reflect on how they mislead the intellect. How true is that old saying of the skeptic; “believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see.” The sense of sight informs that the sun “rises” in the East, passing through that “inverted bowl they call the sky,” “sets” in the West. Science informs, .and proves, the earth rotates on its own axis, and this apparent movement of the sun is an optical illusion. Sight makes two parallel rails meet in the distance, but the wise man will not start walking to this meeting place, he knows “the eye de- ceiveth.” In the Seven Steps we see a varied symbology.

In ancient days when this phrase was originated, a knowledge of these seven sciences or arts represented a liberal education, for they were all the knowledge extant. It follows that one conversant with the sciences enumerated was of the intellectual elite. - The degree of Fellow-craft is intended to develop the intellect to that fine point of discrimination where it can analyze for itself, separate t.he wheat from the chaff and accept or reject the impressions of the phys- ical, material world about us. When this has been achieved, when the self-conscious individual has de- veloped and utilized the talents which self conscious- ness has bestowed upon him, then and only then is he duly and truly prepared to begin his real journey, to TRAVEL IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 3 See Freemasonry Its Hidden Meaning.

The explanation found in the Ritual states that “our ancient brethren held their meetings on high hills and in low vales,” thus the blue sky was the cov- ering of their Lodges. This is further corroborated by the ritualistic explanation of the “Covering of a Lodge,” which is said to be “no less than the clouded canopy or stardecked heavens.” This is but the exo- teric explanation, what is its deeper significance? The Hebrew word Techlet or teklet means “blue,” and comes from a root meaning “perfection.” Thus it is seen that “Blue Lodge” is “Perfection Lodge” and the very name is indicative of that state of being for which one strives-not immortality, hereafter, which all Masons profess to believe they will then attain, but a realization of that immortality HERE AND NOW-COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS!

There is a statement in the Bhagavad G&z which reveals how important is the control of the passions to the individual who aspires to obtain the Master’s Word, and all which such attainment connotes. “There is a PATH to Spirit, which those well learned in the Vedas, call. the Imperishable- that path upon which the strong men, who have mastered their minds (the true Fellow-crafts) and CONTROLLED THEIR PASSIONS (the Master Masons) seek to tread.” ’ The step is a combination of the two preceding steps, and we recall that the advent of the spiritual into matter is the cause of the birth of the psychical.

His first “round” is that of lowliest officer in the line, he emulates the soul of man on its seven rounds, working up through the seven chairs of the Lodge until he becomes Master of the Lodge, i.e., at- tains MASTERSHIP.

The candidate thinks he is a Master Mason. By analogy, he has every right to consider himself pos- sessed of the third degree; he has repeated the same process which in the material degree made him an Entered Apprentice,-and in the psychical degree qual- ified him as a Fellow-craft. Why then, is he not a Master Mason? Because, while the Lodge can make him an Entered Apprentice and a Fellow-craft, by the very nature of things it CANNOT MAKE HIM A MASTER MASON! Through initiation the aspirant is led to the thresh- old; he is, so to speak, placed in that “proper posi- tion,” but the attainment is a personal achievement, beyond the ability of the Lodge to even participate in.

And let there be no confusion on this point; this perfect spiritual man is not the product of that phenomenon we call death, he is not a disembodied entity, but one who has achieved to the spiritual state while still in corporeal form. He is a “Tsadek” in the true meaning and full implication of the Hebrew, a MASTER, possessed of a physical organism, an en- lightened intellect which has guided him to a high moral and ethical plane and cognition of the spiritual.

These two acts are but variations of the Eastern sys- tem .of attaining Illumination through meditation. In line with this thought it should be noted that some rituals add “meditate upon the wonders of the Uni- verse.” As the drama unfolds, three attacks are perpe- trated, and their nature is indicated by the instru- ment of each. The first is the ineffectual assault of the physical.’ The second, likewise futile, is the at- tack upon the stability of the psychical; while the third is directed to the spiritual.3 To this last, the individual succumbs 4 and by the same symbology it ‘The twenty-four-inch gauge, in a horizontal position, is the symbol of the “level of time,” the physical, and it is a working tool of the Apprentice, the Physical, Material man. 2 The square is symbolical of the psychical, and a working tool of the Fellow-craft, the Psychical man. , 3 We have pointed out in Freemasonry Its Hidden Meaning (page 156, and illustrated on page 206) that the setting maul, concealing an equi- lateral triangle, is actually a spiritual emblem. 4 At first glance this symbology may be somewhat confusing to the student of Masonry.

If the concept of the quest for the Lost Word in Masonry can be determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, to be patterned on the idea of the Ineffable name of Deity, then we have identified it as one with the ancient quest, and it must be of the same essence. The name of Deity, per se, was of little interest to the ancients. What they sought to know was the es- sence of the name itself. With the ancients a name was descriptive of the thing named, thus to know the name of Deity was to know the thing described, i.e., DEITY. Knowing, or understanding, Deity is to know SELF, for to know the original is to know the image and likeness thereof. Such an understanding must of necessity place one on a different plane of existence, just as self con- sciousness is an entirely different level from simple consciousness. As the former makes one cognizant of himself as an entity apart from all other entities and things, introducing the individual to a world un- known to simple consciousness, so this understanding porarily inhabits. We should concentrate our attention on the fact that he is “struck down,” and subordinate the idea of his physical death, We all too well appreciate the inadequacy of this explanation, but to say more might involve us in “reveaEing the secrets of Masonry” rather than explaining. 5 See Freemasonry Its Hidden Meaning.

The cycle starts with spiritual man WITHOUT OBJECTIVE CON- SCIOUSNESS of his estate or consciousness of self; his devolution to simple consciousness, bereft of knowledge of either the spiritual or the self; the slow acquisition of self consciousness, the development of the intellectual power, and the final return to the spiritual, or the rediscovery thereof: with the reten- tion of the attributes acquired through the process.

Again, the ritual “rationally” accounts for their action, but it is not the “rational” explanation which attracts our at- tention, rather it is the underlying meaning. In this specific instance the fact that there are three ruffians ceases to have symbolic significance; all are Fellow-craft, and as such collectively typify the Psychical Man. Allegorically, we are informed that he desires to leave the “country” in which he presently finds himself, i.e., the psychical plane, and embark on a journey to a “foreign country”- the spiritual realm.

It is remarkable how much is portrayed in this seemingly simple scene ; it contains volumes if one but takes the time and trouble to analyze it and study its full implications. Not being able to depart, the Craftsmen “turned back into the country and hid in a cave.” To “turn back” is to retreat from an at- tained position, and a cave is an ancient symbol of the darkness of ignorance. Likewise a cave is mate- rial, and the implication is obvious that the Psychical Man, impatient of achieving the spiritual, has taken refuge in materiality.
