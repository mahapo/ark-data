The purpose of these lectures is to consider the origin and nature of the Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry and to show the relation which they bear one to the other. Freemasonry deals largely with the morals and symbols of the Mys- teries of Antiquity, and originally was one of the channels of Ancient Wisdom. There were a few among the founders of Mod- ern Masonry who possessed the Royal Secret, or, at least, had a knowledge of its existence, and, if the key has been lost, the Mason, as Heir-apparent of the Old Wisdom, should be foremost in the search for its recovery. All agree that the Masonic symbols and tradi- tions are of the greatest antiquity, and can be traced to the far East to the earliest civilization, from which time and place they have spoken in nature's language to all peoples of the earth. We are more and more convinced that this picture language of our ritual contains a most complete philosophy a knowledge embracing the eternal verities of the universe, and that these symbols were designed by the Initiates of old to preserve and convey that Ancient Wisdom to the present"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"10 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry and future generations. Though empires and dynas- tic continents have appeared and passed away, these ancient symbols, hewn in rock-cut temples and monuments, have served to convey the Great Secret from ages past and will continue its record as long as this part of the universe remains. Modern Masonry, has become in a special sense, the custodian of these ancient symbols; and should not be content with its possession only, nor with merely imitating its various predecessors; but should enter boldly into the inheritance of its birthright and seek the Ancient Wisdom of its illustrious prototypes. To confine the inteipretation of its symbols and legends to lessons in morality and fraternity, such as are found in all exoteric religions, is not to grasp the deeper meaning that the glyphs and parables were meant to convey. Many to-day realize this fact and they are seeking still '\"More Light\" without, as well as within the tiled doors of our Lodges. In setting forth the results of modern research con- cerning the symbols and legends of antiquity and their meaning in Modern Masonry, I shall not lift the veil from the secrets of the Order, but will endeavor to lead the initiate to the clearer light that he may not only see for himself the connection, linking the past, with the present; but will begin to know, through the development of his higher Masonic manhood, the mighty truth of which these symbols speak. In this endeavor I shall only refer to those things in Ma- sonry that are exoteric and contained in our best publications.

THE ORIGIN AND OBJECT OF THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES. Along with the popular traditions and public cults of ancient times, there existed an inner organization of religion the Mystery Institution which was the channel of secret traditions. While our knowledge of the Mysteries is not so extensive as we could desire, owing to the fact that they were anciently guarded with the greatest care the slightest violation of the oath of secrecy be- ing punishable by death we know that the mys- tery-side of religion, a knowledge of its highest cult and doctrines, was only attained through initiation. Every great Teacher of antiquity passed through these portals. This one fact in itself makes the study of the Mysteries of the utmost importance to Masons. The Institution of the Mysteries was to be found in all parts of the world. There were the Mysteries of Isis and Osiris in Egypt, the Mithraic Mysteries of the Persians, the Orphic and Bacchic and the later Eleusinian semi-Mysteries of Greece, the Mysteries of Samothrace and Chaldea, the Mysteries of India, the Druidical Mysteries, the Gothic Mysteries, and many others. Thus it follows that the key to antiquity is a knowledge of its Mysteries. The late Gen. Albert"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Pike, formerly Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council, Southern Jurisdiction, A. A. S. R. illustrates this by saying: \"Through the veil of all the hieratic and mystic allegories of the ancient dogmas, under the seal of all the sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or Thebes, on the worn stones of the ancient temples, and on the blackened face of the sphinx of Assyria or Egypt, in the monstrous or marvelous pictures which the sacred pages of the Vedas translate for the believers of India, in the strange emblems of our old books of Alchemy, in the ceremonies of reception practiced by all the mysterious Societies, we find traces of a doctrine everywhere the same, and everywhere carefully concealed. The occult philosophy seems to have been the nurse or godmother of all religions, the secret lever of all the intellectual forces, the key of all divine obscurities, and the Absolute Queen of Society, in the ages when it was exclusively re- served for the education of the Priests and Kings.\" (Morals and Dogma, p. 729.) THE ORIGIN OF THE MYSTERIES. The Mysteries had their origin in the first great Teachers and Guides of humanity. These are called the \"Sons of Venus,\" they formed the \"Nursery of Adepts\" the nucleus of the first Great White Lodge. The Chief of these is known by many mys- tic names in the old writings the \"Root Base of the Occult Hierarchy,\" the \"Kumara,\" etc. Sur- rounding the Chief there was a small band of Be- ings who came to earth to labor for the evolution of young humanity. Another class of Beings who"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Origin and Object of the Ancient Mysteries 15 aided in this work was called Agnishvattas. Many of these, we are told in the \"Stanzas of Dzyan,\" became Arhats. Thus was established upon earth, according to tradition, the first Great Occult Hierarchy. In the early ages occult knowledge was taught openly, as the sciences are taught in our colleges to-day. But in the course of time many allowed their selfishness to rule and so abused their power that it became necessary to withhold such knowl- edge from the unworthy. This was the condition of religious affairs when the Mysteries were neces- sarily established by the King-Priests of the Divine Dynasties, in the days of Atlantis. There were many already in possession of occult knowledge who were so engrossed in selfishness that they could not be brought into the divine path ; and their abuse of this power over the forces of nature made them giants of evil. They re- belled against the White Emperor, and became Black Magicians, this caused a long and fierce struggle. At last the cup of evil was full; the forces of nature were turned against the land, until the great continent, together with all followers of their own selfish practice, sank beneath the waters of the ocean. Before the storm broke, however, the men of the \"Good Law\" heeding the summons to escape, migrated to a place of safety. Before the overthrow of Atlantis the Mysteries were well established in ancient Chaldea and Egypt the two great Fourth race nations being off- shoots of the great Atlantean civilization. The In- dian Mysteries came from her own Priest King, the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Manu, who gave to the first branch of the Aryan stock its religious teaching. From this fount of the Aryan race the Mystery-teaching in after years flowed westward, and mingling with the older tradi- tion, derived from Ancient Atlantis, gave to it new life and power. The Greeks received their Mys- teries from Orpheus, who introduced them direct from India. But from 1 whatever source the various nations received their mystic instruction, the mean- ing was ever the same all Initiates were members of the one Great Brotherhood. In these early days the Mystery-Institutions were conducted by Great Adepts whose knowledge was the fruitage of a prior system of evolution ; but as time went on and our humanity developed, the great Masters grad- ually withdrew, and the Mysteries were committed to the advanced pupils of our present system of evolution. THE SOURCE OF RELIGIONS. There are two schools of thought in the modern world Comparative Mythologists and Comparative Religionists. The answers given by these two schools to the question of the source of religion are diametrically opposed, but both base their argu- ments upon the same common facts. These facts are of marked similarity, not only in the teaching, character, and power of the Founders of religions, but also of the main outlines of their lives. The stories of these Savior-Gods and their teach- ings antedate, some of them by many centuries, the birth of the Christian Savior. This similarity amounting in many cases to practical identity, denotes,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Origin and Object of the Ancient Mysteries 17 according to both schools, a common origin. The Comparative Mythologists contend that the common origin is one of common ignorance, that the universal natural phenomena and the person- ification of these powers of nature, resulted in simi- lar ideas. This school maintains that the loftiest religious sentiments and doctrines are merely the refined feeling and expression of the barbarous guesses of primitive men ; that Animalism, Fetish- ism and Nature-worship are the soil out of which the highest forms of religious flowers have blos- somed and that the founders of the great religions are the highly developed but lineal descendants of the \"whirling medicine man.\" On the other hand, the Comparative Religionists maintain that the common origin is one of Divine Wisdom, or Gnosis. All religions, they say, origin- ate from the teachings of Divine Men, who con- stitute a great Brotherhood of Spiritual Teachers, and give out from time to time, to different races and nations of the world, such parts of the funda- mental truths of religion as are suited to the needs of the people. They contend that Animalism, Fetishism, and Nature-worship are the distorted and dwarfed de- scendants of true religious belief, and that the founders of great religions are men who have ad- vanced beyond normal humanity, thus becoming the spiritual guardians of the race. We have no hesitancy in saying that we ac- cept the view of the Comparative Religionists, for the Scriptures of the various religions furnish abundant evidence that the founders were advanced"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"18 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry men, and their teachings are not surpassed (or oft- en equaled) by later writers in the same religions. The Sacred Books of the East give ample evidence of this fact ; while the alleged refining process of the Mythologists is without adequate support. We also find among savages many traces of lofty ideas which are entirely beyond their capacity to originate. When we remember that the savage tribes of to-day are not our ancestral types, but rather the degenerate offspring of past great na- tions, we begin to understand how they came to possess these lofty ideas they are the faint remain- ing vestiges of the Wisdom long ago imparted by a great religious Teacher. (Esoteric Christianity, Besant, Ch. i.) It is evident that man in his infancy was not left to grow up unaided. There have always been Elders or Sages from whom the less advanced breth- ren received direction and training; such ever stood beside the earliest cradle of humanity, and gave to the race the needed guidance and impulse toward a higher ideal of civilization. The first great Teachers were advanced souls from other and still earlier systems of evolution. They were the Adepts of the early races who es- tablished upon this earth the first great Occult Fra- ternity. These lofty Beings watched over and guided early mankind; and as men advanced and became fitted for higher knowledge they were in- structed in the nature of the gods, the human soul, the mysteries of the unseen world, and the process- es of the world's continual evolution. Such are"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Origin and Object of the Ancient Mysteries 19 the persistent and uncontradictory facts in con- nection with the Mysteries. Religions, then, have their source in the Occult Hierarchy the qualified guardians of the spiritual growth of the human family. REASONS FOR ESOTERICISM. History has noted the disastrous results of spread- ing occult knowledge indiscriminately, and since the sad experiences of Atlantis, the Initiates have carefully guarded from the unpurified that knowledge which is power. Therefore, the most rigid conditions regarding purity, unselfishness and self-control are imposed on all who seek the higher knowledge. The tempta- tion to use power for selfish ends is too great to entrust such knowledge to men of uncontrolled desires. Another reason for esotericism is the fact that re- ligions were given for the purpose of quickening human evolution. Men are at such various stages of development, that what will be understood by the philosopher is unintelligible to another, and in order to reach and help all, it is evident that in- struction must be adapted to the peculiar needs of each individual. The religious teachings must be as graded as evolution itself each must be met on their own level and helped on and on, from that plain to greater heights and broader views, all in a fashion that appeals to their unfolding intellects. It is due to this fact that all the great Teachers have reserved the greater truths for those capable of receiving and understanding them."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"20 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry SECRECY OF INITIATES. This has been the method of all great instructors. Initiates of all ages have maintained a profound silence concerning the truths learned in the Mys- teries. From Orpheus, the first Initiate, of whom history catches a glimpse, to Pythagoras, Con- fucius, Buddha, Apollonius, Jesus, Saccus, no Teacher ever committed anything to writing for indiscriminate public use. Herodotus, in speaking of the reasons why ani- mals were worshipped, says: \"If I were to explain these reasons, I should be led to the disclosure of these holy matters, which I particularly wish to avoid,\" and again in other matters, \"Concerning these, at the same time that I confess myself suf- ficiently informed, I feel myself compelled to be sil- ent. Of the ceremonies also in honor of Ceres, I may not venture to speak, further than the obliga- tions of religion will allow me.\" Jesus charged his disciples that they tell no man that he was the Christ, also saying, \"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine; lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you.\" He surely had good reason for his secrecy. Many have learned the wisdom of these words when too late; Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, and Socrates, are 'notable examples. The great Teachers instructed their chosen dis- ciples in the higher knowledge and propagated these truths in allegories and parables. \"All that can be said concerning the Gods,\" says Strabo, \"must be by exposition of old opinions and fables;"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Origin and Object of the Ancient Mysteries 21 it being the custom of the ancients to wrap up in images and allegory their thoughts and discoveries concerning nature.\" Pythagoras, the great mathematical Mason, di- vided his classes into the exoteric and esoteric, and his secrets were forbidden to be committed to writ- ing. The Society of the Essenes, among whom were St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, made similar distinctions; dividing their adherents into Neophytes, Brethren, and Perfect, while Am- monius Saccus obliged his disciples by oath not to divulge his doctrines, except to those who had been thoroughly instructed and prepared. In Egypt we find the same method in practice, for Clement says, \"The Egyptians did not entrust the mysteries they possessed to all and sundry, and did not divulge the knowledge of divine things to the profane.\" He also informs us that the sphinxes erected in front of the temples and places of In- itiation denoted silence and secrecy that all sac- red truth is enfolded in symbolical fables and al- legories and he says of the Mysteries, \"Those who instituted the Mysteries, being philosophers, buried their doctrines in myths, so as not to be obvious to all.\" (The Stromata, Book V, Ch. VII, Ch. IX.) The Sages of Greece, according to Pausanias, \"Never wrote otherwise than in an enigmatical manner.\" They concealed their knowledge under the veil of fiction and so taught that the vulgar might not comprehend. The typical Hermes as- sembled his disciples in a holy place or shrine where"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry strict secrecy was imposed. In the Perfect Sermon he says, \"And ye, O Tat, Asclepius and Ammon, in silence hide the mysteries divine within the se- cret places of your hearts, and breathe no word of their concealment.\" This was the universal pro- cedure. Says Wm. R. Singleton, 33d degree, Past Grand Secretary, Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia: \"The wisdom of the Chaldeans, Phoenicians, Egyp- tions, Jews of Zoroaster, Sanconiathon, Pherecydes, Syrus, Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato ; of all the ancients, that is come to our hand, is symbolic. ... In the method explaining the various symbols, religion and philosophy were veiled in allegoric representations. These symbols were displayed openly in the temples .... to the profane altogether obscure, but streaming with beams of light to the Initiated.\" (History of Freemasonry and Con- cordant Orders, p. 83.) OCCULT SYSTEMS OF WRITING. There were various methods employed by the teachers to convey and yet conceal the truths of the Mysteries. The three main Kabbalistic sys- tems are the Gematria, which is based on the nu- merical value of words applying to the letters of a word the sense they bear as numbers ; the Temu- ra, by which a word yields its mystery by anagram the transposition of the letters and the Notari- con, which may be compared to stenography. The system of number-letters was derived from Chal- dea by the Hebrews during and subsequent to their captivity. The Chaldeans worked out their cos-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Origin and Object of the Ancient Mysteries 23 mogonies and anthropogeneses in numbers, their sacred books were written with this object in view; Pythagoras had a number-philosophy, which in all probability held many resemblances to the number- books of Chaldea ; this method was developed to a great extent by the Hellenising tendencies of the cultured Rabbis of Alexandria. The Gnostics also made much use of this number-symbolism the system of Marcus being quite elaborate, and the books of Hermes are probably the oldest repositor- ies of number-symbolism in western civilization. Closely connected with this was Geometrical symbolism, which was also used by Pythagoras the square, triangle, point within the circle, cube, double triangle, 47th. problem of Euclid, etc., the geometrical figures representing the numbers ob- jectively. In every cosmology from the earliest times we find the basic idea combining numerical geometrical figures. There is also the allegorical method a setting forth of truth in the form of myths, or parables, and furthermore, the secret sacerdotal tongue, the Senzar, which was known to the Initiates of every nation. Then to rightly read the world's Script- ures one must have the keys to all these various systems. OBJECT OF THE MYSTERIES. The object of the Mysteries was the instruction and development of man. They were the work of genius employing the sciences and a profound knowledge of the human heart in the task of puri-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry fying the soul, and seeking man's felicity by the means of virtue. Great emphasis was laid upon man's immortality, and the object and purpose of the Mysteries was to fit him for a blessed state beyond. Thus these mysteries taught the condi- tion of the postmortem state, and strove to develop in the candidate the powers that would enable him to verify the instruction, for, himself. Antiquity had held that there was a science of the soul, a knowledge of things unseen, a Gnosis; and now that the possibility of extending the bounds of consciousness beyond the physical plane has been proven by many experiments in psychism, the claim of the Mysteries is not beyond rational belief. That the ego may transcend the limits of the body and become conscious on the higher planes of nature verifies the truth of the mysteries of all ages and proves that nature's God, in infinite wis- dom, through the constant progress or development of his children, is initiating them from every field of labor to aid in his mighty work. The higher instruction was not only given by perfected Initiates who could function on the higher planes, but the assistance of angelic hierarchies was also invoked and those exalted Beings came to teach and elevate by their presence. lamblichus, the great Theurgist of the third and fourth cen- turies A. D. says, \"The Gods [these Beings are not Gods in the Western sense of the term but Angels, or Devas; Plato calls them the 'Minor Gods' to distinguish them from the Supreme] \"be- ing benevolent and propitious, impart their light to Theurgists in unvarying abundance, calling up-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Origin and Object of the Ancient Mysteries 25 ward their souls ta themselves, procuring for them a union with themselves, and accustoming them, while they are yet in body, to be separate from bodies, and to be led around to their eternal and in- telligible principle.\" For \"the soul having a twofold life, one being in conjunction with body but the other being separate from all body,\" it is most necessary to learn to separate from the body, that thus it may unite with the Gods and learn the truths of the intelligible world. (Esoteric Christianity, p. 24, 25.) The consummation of all this was to make the Initiate a God, either by union with a Divine Being without or by the realization of the Divine Self within. Sallust says that the object of the ceremonies of Initiation was to unite man with the world and Deity. The Initiate claimed that the soul puri- fied from all stain, could see the Gods in this life that is, could attain the beatific vision, and hold communion with the Immortals. Prof. Harnick re- marks that deification was the idea of salvation taught in the Mysteries. The Greek Neo-platonists called this state \"The- ophany,\" which means either communication be- tween the Gods or God and those Initiated mortals who are spiritually fit to enjoy such intercourse; or the presence of a God in man, an incarnation or blending of the personal Deity; the Higher self with the lower self its representative on earth. Plotinus defines this state as \"The liberation of the mind from its finite consciousness, becoming one and identified with the Infinite.\" The length and"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry frequency of this sublime condition depends upon the spiritual development. Proclus claims to have experienced this ecstasy six times during his mystic life ; Plotinus states that he had reached this state \"but three times as yet ;\" Porphyry asserts that Ap- polonius attained this state four times, while he experienced it but once, and that after he was sixty years of age. This illumination may come and go as a flash, or it may last for hours. With the high Initiates, the Word is really made flesh, the union complete, and its duration continuous throughput life. The Mysteries were as a training school to this end. Philo in speaking of the Divine Vision says, \"It is the special gift of those who dedicate themselves to the service of That-which-is- . . . . to ascend by means of their rational facul- ties to the height of the aether, setting before them- selves 'Moses' the Race that is the friend of God (The Race of the Logos) as the leader of the way . . . . the work of philosophy is naught else than the striving clearly to see these things.\" Proclus also says, \"In all the Initiations and Mys- teries, the Gods exhibit many forms of themselves, and appear in a variety of shapes ; and sometimes, indeed a formless light of themselves is held forth to the view ; sometimes this light is according to a human form and sometimes it proceeds into a different shape.\" (Quoted in Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries, Taylor, p. 66.) Taylor too, correctly infers, \"The most sublime part of the epopteia or final revealing, consisted in beholding the Gods [high planetary spirits] them-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Origin and Object of the Ancient Mysteries 27 selves, invested with a resplendent light.\" (Ibid, or same book, p. 65.) In Plato's Phaedo, Socrates is made to say, \"Those who instituted the Mysteries for us appear to have been by no means contemptible, but in reality to have intimated long since that whoever shall arrive in Hades unexpiated and uninitiated shall lie in mud [a symbol of the gloomy surroundings of the lowest reg- ion of the astral world], but he that arrives there purified and Initiated, shall dwell with the gods.\" (Plato, Cory's Translation, Vol. I, p. 68.) Again in Phaedrus, Plato says, \"Initiated into that which may be rightly called the most blessed of all Mysteries, which we celebrated when we were whole and un- affected by the evils that awaited us in time to come, and moreover when we were initiated in, and beheld in the pure light, perfect, simple, calm, and blessed visions, being ourselves pure, and as yet unmasked with this which we now carry about with us and call the body, fettered to it like an oyster to its shell.\" (Ibid, p. 326.) If we admit the existence of faculties in man capable of piercing- the veil of matter, we shall find no reason for rejecting the plain evidence of ancient writers that the Mysteries were associated with a psychic and spiritual revelation. Hermes in his sermons has much to say on the Gnosis. Gnosis of God is the science of sciences. In \"The Key\" he tells us that \"The distinctive fea- ture of Good (God) is that it should be known.\" This is the \"Vision Glorious.\" As stated by Mead in his commentary, \"This consummation of Ecstasis"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry (the extension of consciousness), we are told, was a transcending of the limitations of body, and was a faculty possessed by the forbears of the 'race' into which Hermes and now Tat are being born.\" (Thrice Greatest Hermes, Vol. II, p. 162.) The nature of Ecstasy is further explained as the fruit of meditation and contemplation. \"The Gnosis of the Good is holy silence and a giving holiday to every sense.\" This is in accord with the Yoga of the Upanishads, which shows identity of thought of those who have had first hand experience. Hermes proceeds, \"For it is possible, my son, that a man's soul should be made like to God, e'en while it still is in a body, if it doth contemplate the Beauty of the Good.\" This is the true deification or apotheosis Man is like God in that he becomes a God. The result of the evolution of the soul was the attainment unto the \"first steps of deathless- ness,\" spoken of by Paul as the \"resurrection of the dead.\" \"The soul's vice,\" says Hermes, \"is ignorance .... But on the other hand, the virtue of the soul is Gnosis. For he who knows, he good and pious is, and still while on the earth divine.\" Here we have the attainment of the divine state, that of Adeptship while still in the body. Proclus held that Initiation elevated the soul, from a material, sensual, and purely human life, to a communion and celestial intercourse with the Gods; and that a variety of things, forms, and species were shown to Initiates, representing the first generation of the Gods. In speaking of Petosiris, Proclus tells us that this Egyptian Philosopher had an intimate knowledge"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Origin and Object of the Ancient Mysteries 29 of every order of the Gods and Angels, and refers to a hieratic formula of theurgic invocation to the greatest of the goddesses (Necessity), for inducing the vision of this power. Valens tells us of Nechep- so who attained to direct knowledge of the Inner Way. Vettius, in the first half of the first century A. D. laments that he did not live in those days of Initiate Kings, Rulers and Sages who occupied them- selves with the Sacred Science. In those days so great was their love for the holy mysteries, so high their virtue, that they left the earth below them, and in their deathless souls became \"heaven walk- ers\" and knowers of things divine. Vettius also quotes a Greek apocalyptic treatise of Nechepso where the king tells us that he had remained in contemplation all night gazing into the aether; and so in ecstasy he left his body and had then heard a heavenly Voice addressing him. This Voice was not merely a sound, but appeared as a substantial presence, who guided Nechepso on his way through the heavenly space. (Thrice Greatest Hermes, Vol. I, p. 101.) Cicero considered the establishment of the Eleu- sinian Mysteries to be the greatest of all benefits conferred by Athens on other commonwealths; their effect having been to civilize men, soften savage ferocious manners, and teach them the true principles of morality, which initiate man into the only kind of life worthy of him. (Cicero cited in Morals and Dogma, p. 380.) The Mysteries pro- cured for man a real felicity on earth by means of virtue. He was taught the immortality of the soul and the inflexible laws of divine justice, and the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"30 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry great moral precepts were made known 'not only to the Initiates but also to the profane. The Mys- teries pointed out to men the way to \"live better and die happier;\" but, as we have seen, the object of the Mysteries was not merely to teach morality, for as Gen. Pike well says, \"Had moral truths alone been taught the Initiates, the Mysteries could never have deserved nor received the magnificent eulogiums of the most enlightened men of An- tiquity of Pindar, Plutarch, Isocrates, Diodorus, Plato, Euripides, Socrates, Aristophanes, Cicero, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and others: philosophers hostile to the Sacredotal Spirit, or historians devoted to the investigation of Truth. No: all the sciences were taught there; and those oral or written tradi- tions briefly communicated, which reached back to the first age of the world.\" (Ibid, p 373.) The object of the Mysteries, then, was to instruct men in the real science of being, and to lead them up the stairway to perfection to the superhuman stage to the Christ and that which transcends even perfect Masterhood. In this way they sought to purify the soul, hold- ing that the true home of the soul was in the high- er spheres, the earth a place of exile, and that to return to its birthplace the soul must free itself from the power of the world must be emancipated from the passions and the hindrances of the senses. The Mysteries taught men how to attain the do- minion of the soul, which was absolutely necessary as \"We must flee from everything sensual,\" says Porphyry, \"that the soul may with ease reunite itself with God.\""},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Origin and Object of the Ancient Mysteries 31 Thus the Mysteries sought to sanctify men, to illuminate their souls and fit them to return con- sciously to union with the Deity. The Gnostics all claimed that a man could so perfect himself that he would become a conscious worker with the Logos. The object of the Mysteries, then, was not only to teach the unity of God and the immortality of the soul, as Warburton, Mackey and other Masonic writers contend, but to enable each man to verify these great spiritual facts for himself. These citations from the ancient classic writers and philosophers regarding the Mysteries might be greatly extended, but this will suffice to show the reverence and admiration in which the Mysteries were -held. Would these Mysteries have received such high praise had they not known them to be of divine origin? As has been well said, \"When men like Pythagoras, Plato, and lamblichus, renowned for their severe morality, took part in the Mysteries and spoke of them with veneration it ill behooves our modern critics to judge them upon their merely external aspects.\" Many have accepted without question certain derogatory statements of the early Christian Apologists concerning the Mysteries, without taking into consideration the fact that the writers were animated by the spirit of bitter con- troversy. Due allowance should be made for this, placing such statements in the same category as those of the Pagans, when they charge the Chris- tians with being Atheists, and practicing shameful rites.

The candidate himself became the thing symbolized Hermes, Budd- ha, Christ, etc. This state was the result of real In- itiation an evolution of the human into the divine. In the course of time this spiritual truth was neg- lected and initiation no longer meant spiritual re- generation, and the rites no longer typified the va- rious stages of the soul's progress the mystic birth, death, and resurrection. The key to the spiritual science was forgotten, the Master's Word \"lost,\" and Initiation consisted merely in imparting to the candidate the traditional knowledge of the symbols as handed down from time immemorial, and gradu- ally the true meaning of the symbols disappeared, and even the symbols themselves were transformed into crude dogmas. THE CEREMONIES OF INITIATION. The Ancient Mysteries were divided into two stages the Probationary Path and the Advanced or Path"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"34 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Proper. In most schools the Probationary Path was merely preliminary, but, as some schools began with the preliminary in numbering the stages or divisions, one needs be on guard to avoid misunderstandings. Others, as in Greece, divided their Mysteries into the Lesser and the Greater. Beyond which there was the True Mystery of the Path. (In other systems the True and the Greater Mysteries were undoubtedly the same.) The higher evolution, belonged to the True or Real Mysteries, to which all others led. A Neophyte was compelled to be proficient along these lines before he was allowed to take the real Initiation and enter upon the Path proper, which will be considered in a subse- quent lecture. There were outer forms and ceremo- nies which stood for and symbolized the True Mys- teries, but little was known of their inner nature ex- cept by those who experienced them. The ceremonies were undoubtedly altered in the course of time, but even in the days of the greatest deterioration we find traces of the hidden wisdom in connection with the ancient symbols some of which have survived, and are to be found in Modern Ma- sonry. THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERIES. The learned Greek Plutarch, himself an Initiate into the Osireaca, of which there was probably a thiasos at Delphi, gives much valuable information regarding the Mysteries of Egypt. Of course, he could only give hints, for, as he says, in speaking of the Priests, \"Their philosophy which for the most part was hidden in myths and words (logoi) contain-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Egyptian, Hindu, and Persian Mysteries 3S ing dim reflections and transparencies of truth, as, doubtless, they themselves make indirectly plain by fitly setting sphynxes up before the temples, as though their reasoning about the Gods possessed a wisdom wrapped in riddle. . . So great, then, was the care Egyptians took about the wisdom which concerned the mysteries of the Gods. And the most wise of the Greeks also are witnesses Solon, Thales, Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and as some say, Lycurgus as well through coming to Egypt and associating with her priests,\" and \"brought back to the memory of his men their symbolic and mysterious [art], containing their dogmas in dark sayings. . . . When, therefore, thou nearest the myth-sayings of the Egyptians con- cerning the Gods wanderings and dismemberings, and many such passions thou shouldst remember what has been said above and think none of these things spoken as they [really] are in state and action.\" (Plutarch: Concerning the Mysteries of Isis and Osiris, Sec. IX, X, XL} This is true not only of the Egyptian myths but of all others. Plutarch then sets forth the Osiris and Isis Mys- tery-Myth. It begins with the birth of the Gods Osiris, the Elder Horus, Typhon, Isis, etc. Osiris and Isis being in love with each other were united. They ruled over Egypt for many years but finally the malicious Typhon, his evil brother, while filled with envy sought his destruction. He devised a beau- tiful chest, and having it brought into the banquet haJl, promised to give it to any one whom it would exactly fit. Osiris stepped in and laid down, where- upon they who were present rushed up and put on the lid and fastened it down, and carried the chest"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"36 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry to the river Nile, whence it was borne out on the flood to the sea. When Isis heard what had been done she set forth in search of the chest, which, mean- while, had been carried by the waves to the Byblos country, where the land-wash brought it to rest in a certain heather bush or tamarisk tree, a species of acacia. This bush grew around, enfolded and hid it entirely within itself. The King Malkander mar- velled at the greatness of the tree, and cut it down and made of it a prop in the form of a pillar for his roof, but Isis having found trace of the chest and its disposition through Anubis and the daemonean spirit of a voice, came also to Byblos and sitting down by a fountain head showed attention to the maids of the Queen, dressing their hair with ambrosia, thus securing an invitation to the palace, where she became nurse of the Queen's little child; then finding time ripe to reveal herself, the Goddess claimed for her own the pillar of the roof, and taking it down, she cut the tree from around the coffin and placing the chest in a boat, carried the body to her son Horus, who concealed it in a deep forest. But Typhon while out hunting came upon it, and recognizing the body as that of Osiris, tore it into fourteen parts, and scat- tered them abroad. Isis, hearing what had been done, sought to recover the parts, and succeeded in finding all but one, which had been cast into the river and eaten by the fishes. Horus then fought Typhon and overpowered him, when it was proclaimed that Osiris had risen from the dead. This is merely an outline of the myth. It has a macrocosmic and microcosmic meaning. In the for- mer sense, Osiris and Isis are cosmic or super-cosmic"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Egyptian, Hindu, and Persian Mysteries 37 beings, symbolized by the sun and moon, and the elder and younger Horus are the Intelligible and Sensible Worlds. Microcosmically the Myth per- tains to the mystery of Initiation the Horus or Christ stage of manhood. In this latter aspect it symbolizes the mystic life of the Initiate. In regard to Initiation Plutarch says, \"When the Initiates of Isis at their 'death' are adorned in these [robes], it is a symbol that this Reason (Logos), is with them; and with Him and naught else they go there [or walk there, that is, in Hades, the death here mentioned is the mystic death unto sin]. For it is not the growing beard and wearing cloak that makes philosophers, O Klea, not clothing in linen and shaving oneself that makes Initiates of Isis; but a true Isiac is one who, when he by law receives them searches out by reason (Logos) the [Mysteries] shown and done concerning these Gods and meditates upon the truth in them.\" (Ibid, Sec. in.) This Mystery rite is referred to by Epiphanius as solemnized in the Temple of Isis who is called the Virgin Mother, or World Virgin. In speaking of the Feast of Epiphany, which was a great day in Egypt connected with the birth of the Aeon (a phase of the birth of Horus) he says, \"Indeed, the leaders of the idol-cults, filled with wiles to deceive the idol worshippers who believe in them, in many places keep highest festival on this same night of Epiphany (the manifestation of Light), so that they whose hopes are in error may not seek the truth. For instance, at Alexandria, in the Koreion, as it is called an im- mense temple that is to say, the precinct of the vir- gin ; after they have kept all night vigil with song and"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"38 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry music, chanting to their idol, when the vigil is over at cock-crow, they descend with lights into an under- ground crypt, and carry up a wooden image lying naked on a litter, with the seal of a cross made in gold on its forehead, and on either hand two similar seals, and on both knees two others, all five seals being similarly made in gold. And they carry around the image itself, circumambulating seven times the inner- most temple, to the accompaniment of pipes, tabors, and hymns, and with merry-making they carry it down again underground. And if they are asked the meaning of this mystery, they answer and say: 'To- day at this hour the Maiden (Kore), that is, the Vir- gin, gave birth to the Aeon.' In the city of Petra also, the same is done, and they sing the praises of the Virgin .... and him who is born from her, Dusares, that is, Alone Begotten of the Lord. This also takes place in the city of Elousa on the same night just as at Petra and at Alexandria.\" Epiphanius as an outsider could not be expected to understand the rites he describes, and as a narrow bigot he could not be expected to deal with them fair- ly. But the importance of the passage is the testi- mony it bears to the fact that one of the most wide- spread mystic festivals was connected with a \"rite of resurrection.\" You notice here the \"crowing of the cock\" which is connected with the crucifixion of Jesus, and the cross marked on the forehead, hands, and knees or feet of the image, or the one who has re- turned from the Underworld (Hades). Epiphanius tells us that the mystic rite represents a macrocosmic mystery. Very true, but it also rep- resents a microcosmic mystery. The mystic birth,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Egyptian, Hindu, and Persian Mysteries 39 death, and resurrection, were familiar to all the schools and communities of ancient times, and the mystic \"rising again from the dead\" was an integral part of the universal mystic-drama. The Initiations of Egypt are described by C. W. Leadbeater, a well known theosophical writer, as fol- lows: \"The candidate was attired in a white-robe, emblematic of the purity which was expected, and brought before a conclave of priest-initiates in a sort of vault or cavern. He was first formally tested as to the development of the clairvoyant faculty which he had been previously instructed how to awaken, and for this purpose had to read an inscription upon a brazen shield, of which the blank side was pre- sented to his physical vision. Later he was left alone to keep a kind of vigil. Certain mantrams, or words of power, had been taught him, which were supposed to be appropriate to control a certain class of entities. . . . Other ceremonies of the Egyptian Mysteries are of interest. ... At one stage of his advance- ment the candidate laid himself upon a curiously hol- lowed wooden cross and, after certain ceremonies, was entranced. His body was then carried down into the vaults underneath the temple or pyramid, while he himself 'descended into Hades,' or the underworld that is to say, in our modern nomenclature, he passed on to the astral plane. Here he had many experiences, part of his work being to 'preach to the spirits in prison ;' for he remained in that trance condition three days and three nights, which typified the three rounds and the intervals between them, during which man was go- ing through the earlier part of his evolution, and de-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"40 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry scending into matter. Then after 'three days and three nights in the heart of the earth/ on the morn- ing of the fourth day, 'he rose again from the dead,' that is .... his body was brought back from the vault, and so placed that the rays of the rising sun fell upon his face and he awoke. This symbolizes the awakening of man in the fourth round, and the com- mencement of his ascent out of matter on the upward arc of evolution.\" (Some Glimpses of Occultism, p. 73-) According to Pietschmann, the Egyptian Mysteries had three grades, called Mortals, Intelligences, and Creators of Light. The Mortals were probationary pupils, who were instructed in the doctrine, but who had not yet realized the inner vision: The Intelli- gences were those who had attained the inner vision and had become men and received Mind. The Cre- ators or Sons of Light were those who had become one with the Light had attained to true spiritual consciousness. These three stages are called by W. Marsham Adams, Initiation, Illumination and Perfec- tion. This state could be attained while yet in the body, and included the after death consciousness as a part of its content. The ancient temples of Initiation in Egypt were models of the \"Heavenly Jerusalem,\" a type of the world-building, to use a Jewish Gnostic term. Adams describes the temple at Denderah thus, \"In the center of the temple is the Hall of the Altar, with entrances opening east and west; and beyond it lies the great hall of the temple entitled the Hall of the Child in his Cradle, from whence access is obtained to the secret and sealed shrine entered once a year by the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Egyptian, Hindu, and Persian Mysteries 41 high priest, on the night of midsummer.\" (The Book of the Master, or the Egyptian Doctrine of the Light Born to the Virgin Mother, Adams, p. 24.) There were also various other halls and chambers, such as Hall of the Golden Rays, Chamber of Gold, Chamber of Birth, Dwelling of the Golden One, Chamber of Flames, all having reference to the Mysteries of Light and a divine Birth. \"The chief Hall of the temple was the Hall of the Child in his Cradle, and the chief representation on the planisphere is the holy Mother with the divine Child in her arms.\" (I bid, P. 24-) THE HINDU MYSTERIES. The Mysteries of India were celebrated in temples carved out of solid rock; and in pyramids and dark pagodas. The temple of Elephanta is perhaps the most ancient in the world. It is one hundred and thirty-five feet square and eighteen feet high, sup- ported by four massive pillars, and its walls are cov- ered with statutes and carved emblematical decora- tions. The temples of Salsette exceed in magnitude those of Elephanta, though they are excavated in rock, their external form being pyramidal. The interior has many galleries and secret caverns, and in the inmost recesses of the structure a \"cubical cista\" a sepul- chre where the candidate was laid during his entranced state. An account of the Initiation is given by Dr. Oliver in his History of Initiations which we herewith con- dense as follows: The mysteries were divided into four degrees. The candidate might perform his first probation at the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"42 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry early age of eight years. This consisted of an in- vestiture of the Zennar or sacred cord of three threads, corresponding to our \"cable-tow.\" This in- vestiture was attended with numerous ceremonies and ended with an extended lecture from the preceptor. After this the candidate was clothed in a linen gar- ment without seams, and a cord put over his right ear, and he was placed under the care of a Brahmin, as a spiritual guide, to be instructed in the necessary qualifications for the Second Degree. He was sub- jected to many hardships and rigid penances and was taught to preserve the purity of his body, to avoid external defilements and to devote much time to study of the sacred books. At the age of twenty, if he were found to have made suitable proficiency in the preceding degree, he was admitted on probation to the Second. Here his austerities were doubled. At the conclusion of this probation he was Initiated into the privileges of the Mysteries. Sanctified by the sign of the Cross, which was marked on every part of the body, he was subjected to the probation of Pastos, which was denominated the door of Patala or hell the Tartarus of the Grecian Mysteries. This was the Mystical death. His perfection of the proba- tionary period being attained, he was led, at the dead of night, to the cave which had been duly prepared for his reception; the interior of this cavern blazed with a light equal to the meridian sun. There sat in rich and costly robes the three chief hierophants, sta- tioned in the East, West and South to represent the Sacred Triad Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, with the attendant Mystagogues, clad in holy vestments seated around.

The oath was then ad- ministered, after which the candidate was sprinkled with water, and a mantra pronounced. He was then divested of his shoes, that the consecrated ground on which he stood might not be polluted, and was then made to circumambulate the temple three times, ex- claiming each time on his arrival in the south, \"I copy the example of the Sun, and follow his benevolent course.\" Here we have the origin of the preparation of the candidate, the circuits, etc., of Modern Ma- sonry. At the conclusion of the circuits, the candidate was placed in the care of a spiritual guide, and directed to observe proper silence during the succeeding cere- monies. He was then passed through seven ranges of dark and gloomy caverns; amid the din of howls, shrieks and dismal lamentations, a sudden explosion was heard which seemed to rend the mountains; flashes of light streamed before his eyes, and then all was darkness and silence. Gradually he beheld shad- ows and phantoms of various shapes, some with many hands, arms and legs, while others had none; the most terrible and frightful figures appeared, all typi- fying the generation of the Gods, and other sacred mysteries. The candidate then personified Vishnu, and was made to perform his numerous Avatars.

After all these trials, the pealing Conch was sound- ed, the folding doors were thrown open, and the can- didate was conducted into Paradise, which was a spa- cious apartment blazing with a thousand brilliant lights, ornamented with statues and emblematical fig- ures, decorated profusely with gems and jewels. With eyes riveted on the altar, he was taught to expect the descent of the Deity in the bright pyramidal fire that blazed upon it. This gorgeous display filled the mind of the aspirant with admiration, and lighted up the holy fervor of devotion in his heart. And now be- ing fully regenerated, a new name was given him, ex- pressive of his recently attained purity, and he was introduced to the chief Brahmin, in the midst of the august assembly, who received him as a brother and associate, invested him with a white robe and tiara, seated him in an elevated place, and solemnly deliv- ered the signs, tokens, and lectures of the Order. His forehead was marked with a cross. An inverted level or tau cross, was inscribed on his breast, this was a badge of innocence and a symbol of eternal life. He was invested with the sacred sash or belt, and finally, he was entrusted with the sublime Name which was known only to the Initiated.

These symbols were publicly displayed in their temples, bear- ing streams of light to the Initiated ; while to the pro- fane they were but an obscure mass of unintelligible darkness. (Oliver's History of Initiations, Ch. //.) THE PERSIAN MYSTERIES. The Persian Mysteries or the Mysteries of Mithras are among the most important of antiquity. Even Pythagoras is said to have travelled from Greece to receive Initiation at the hands of those Persian Hiero- phants. The candidates were prepared for Initiation by various lustrations and forty degree-days of pro- bation, which ended by a fifty-days fast. These trials were undergone in a subterranean cavern, where the candidate was bound to perpetual silence. At the conclusion of his probation he was guided into the Hall of Initiation, and received on the point of a sword presented to his naked left breast. He was conducted into the inner Chamber where he was purified by fire and water, and then conducted through the seven stages of Initiation. Dr. Oliver describes these stages as follows: \"From the precipice where he stood, he beheld a deep and dangerous vault into which a single false step might precipitate him down to the 'throne of dreadful necessity,' which was an emblem of those infernal regions through which he was about to pass."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"46 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Threading the circuitous mazes of the gloomy cavern, he was soon awakened from his trance of thought, by seeing the sacred fire, at intervals, flash through its recesses to illuminate his path; sometimes bursting from beneath his feet; sometimes descending on his head in a broad sheet of white and shadowy flame. Amidst the admiration thus inspired, his terror was excited by the distant yelling of ravenous beasts; the roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the fierce and threatening bark of dogs. Enveloped in blackest dark- ness, he was at a loss where to turn for safety ; but was impelled rapidly forward by his attendant, who main- tained an unbroken silence, towards the quarter from whence the appalling sounds proceeded; and at the sudden opening of a door he found himself in a den of wild beasts, dimly enlightened with a single lamp. His conductor exhorted him to courage, and he was immediately attacked, amidst the most tremendous up- roar, by the initiated in the forms of lions, tigers, wolves, griffins, and other monstrous beasts; fierce dogs appeared to rise from the earth, and with dread- ful howlings endeavored to overwhelm the aspirant with alarm; and how bravely soever his courage might sustain him in this unequal conflict, he seldom escaped unhurt. Being hurried through this cavern into another, he was once more shrouded in darkness. A dead silence succeeded, and he was obliged to proceed with de- liberate step, meditating on the danger he had just escaped, and smarting under the wounds he had re- ceived. His attention, however, was soon roused from these reflections and directed to other dangers which appeared to threaten. An undefined rumbling"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Egyptian, Hindu, and Persian Mysteries 47 noise was heard in a distant range of caverns, which became louder and louder as he advanced, until the pealing thunder seemed to rend the solid rocks and burst the caverns around him ; and the vivid and con- tinued flashes of lightning, in streaming sheets of fire, rendered visible the flitting shades of avenging genii, who, frowning displeasure, appeared to threaten with summary destruction these daring intruders into the privacy of their hallowed abodes. Scenes like these were multiplied with increasing horror, until nature could no longer endure the trial ; and when the aspirant was ready to sink under the effects of ex- haustion and mental agony, he was conveyed into an- other apartment to recruit his strength. Here, a vivid illumination was suddenly introduced, and his out- raged feelings were soothed by the sound of melodious music, and the flavor of grateful perfumes. Seated at rest in this apartment, his guide explained the ele- ments of those invaluable secrets which were more fully developed when his initiation was complete. Having pronounced himself disposed to proceed through the remaining ceremonies, a signal was given by his conductor, and three priests immediately made their appearance ; one of whom, after a long and sol- emn pause, cast; a living serpent into his bosom as a token of regeneration; and a private door being opened, there issued forth such howlings and cries of lamentation and despair, as struck him with new and indescribable emotions of terror.

He was ad- mitted into the spacious and lofty cavern already de- scribed, which was denominated the sacred grotto of Elysium. This consecrated place was brillinatly il- luminated, and sparkled with gold and precious stones. A splendid sun and starry system emitted their daz- zling radiance, and moved in order to the symphonies of heavenly music. Here sat the Archimagus in the East, elevated on a throne of burnished gold, crowned with a rich diadem decorated with myrtle boughs, and habited in a flowing tunic of a bright cerulean tincture; round him were arranged in solemn order the Presules, and dispensers of the mysteries; form- ing altogether a reverend assembly, which covered the awe-struck aspirant with a profound feel- ing of veneration; and by an involuntary impulse, frequently produced an act of worship. Here he was received with congratulations; and after having en- tered into the usual engagements for keeping secret the sacred rites of Mithras, the sacred words were entrusted to him, of which the ineffable Tetractys, or Name of God, was the chief.

The meaning of the emblems was ex- plained, the incidents experienced converted to a moral purpose, and their significance made clear. Nothing was done without a purpose and every ex- perience illustrated some truth and fact in nature. What they were designed to set forth we shall see in subsequent lectures. Suffice it here to say, that the Mithra-Mystery was identical with the Christ-Mystery the mystery of man's perfection and final apotheosis. \"The secret of regeneration, of being born anew or spiritually, or from above in brief, the divinizing of man, was the last word of the Mithra-rites ; all else 13 introductory or ancillary. This secret was the one secret of all the great mystery-rites and mystery- arts.\" (Mysteries of Mithra, Mead, p. 47.) A Ritual dealing with the mystery of apotheosis and used by the most advanced in the Mithraic eso- teric circles has recently been discovered. It is a \"yoga-rite,\" one far in advance of the lower grades of Initiation. Initiation does not mean consumma- tion it is merely starting things going. The candi- date, to make the initiation valid, must \"seal up the links,\" so to speak, and this Mithraic Ritual has to do with the final stages of spiritual evolution. (For a complete exposition of this Ritual see \"A Mithraic Ritual,\" by G. R. S. Mead.) Besides the various rites of Initiation already de- scribed, we find the same sacraments in the Mys- teries that in later years were administered in the Christian Church."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"50 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Justin Martyr, 150 A.

D., in speaking of the Mithraic Mysteries, says, \"He, too, baptizes some that is, his own believers and faithful followers; he promises the putting away of sins by a laver (of his own) ; and if my memory still serves me, Mithra there, (in the kingdom of Satan,) sets his marks on the foreheads of his soldiers; celebrates also the oblation of bread, and in- troduces an image of a resurrection, and before a sword wreaths a crown.\" (Prescription Against Heretics, Ch. XL.) Tertullian also explains the identities by resorting to the convenient theory of the Devil aping the Chris- tian forms. But this curious explanation will hardly find adherents to-day it is difficult to accept the earlier as copies, and the more recent as originals. We shall see later the origin and meaning of these similarities. Thus we find in the ancient Egyptian, Hindu and Persian Mysteries, a system of religious culture and training that originated thousands of years ago, and which through many centuries preserved and handed down the Master's Word to those who had made suf- ficient progress, and were thereby \"duly and truly pre- pared\" to receive it.

THE DRUIDICAL, GOTHIC, GRECIAN, AND JEWISH MYSTERIES. We are to continue in this lecture our examination of the Mysteries of antiquity. We will consider first THE DRUIDICAL MYSTERIES. The Druidical Mysteries were the same as the Cel- tic, and were celebrated in many countries. We are told by Caesar that these Mysteries were better un- derstood in Britain than anywhere else. All temples, in whatever country, had places of In- itiation connected with them, and they were usually subterranean. The great grotto at Castleton in Der- byshire bears evidence that the celebration of the Druidical Mysteries was of an elaborate nature; the temple at Abury was also a stupendous structure, and was built in the form of a circle. The periods of Initiation were quarterly and were held at the time of the equinoxes and solstices. There were three degrees in the Druidical Mysteries Eubatea, Bards, and Druids, and it was obligatory that the candidate for Initiation be well qualified and duly prepared mental and moral perfection being the first requisite. When the candidate had passed the probationary stage he was clad in a robe, striped with white, blue, and green, emblematical of light, truth,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"52 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry and hope, and confined in a cromlech (tomb) for parts of three days without food, dead, in the lan- guage of the Mysteries, after which he was liberated for Initiation, and restored to life on the third day. This confinement preceded his Initiation into each of the two first degrees. When the Aspirant was liber- ated he was placed in the hands of an officer and con- ducted around the sanctuary nine times, at first with slow and measured step, which at length was in- creased to a rapid pace. During the circuits there was a clang of musical instruments and recitations in praise of those who were heroic in war, courteous in peace, and the friends of religion. At the completion of this ceremony the oath of secrecy was administered and the aspirant then went through various ceremo- nies in which he represented many characters, declar- ing among other things, \"I have died,\" and \"I have revived,\" alluding to his mystical death and resur- rection. In the second part of the ceremony there was the dismal darkness, the direful shrieks, the barking dogs, etc., with which we have been made familiar in the preceding Mysteries. The aspirant finally emerged from the gloom, and found himself surrounded with the most brilliant coruscations of light, being then presented to the Archdruid, who instructed him in the Mysteries, imparting the knowledge of Druidism, and exhorting him to the practice of virtue. There was still another degree to be administered to those who aspired to a high degree of perfection.

When the period of gestation in the womb of Cer id- wen was complete, as the confinement in the tomb was termed, the candidate was ready for further in- struction. Another trial, however, must be braved before the highest degree of light could be conferred. The candidate, now called the \"new born infant,\" was placed in a boat, and committed to the mercy of the waves. If he succeeded in securing a safe landing place, he was triumphantly received, and this comple- tion of the Three Degrees made the aspirant, a \"thrice born\" conferring upon, him the power of inspiration and prophecy in the highest form. The Druids maintained a high intellectual standard, for they taught their disciples astronomy, botany, an- atomy, languages, medicine, etc. Thus we see the Mysteries were always repositories of Wisdom.

The most significant was celebrat- ed at the winter Solstice and dedicated to Thor. The next celebration was dedicated to Frea and com- menced at the second moon in the new year. The third was dedicated to Odin and was held in the spring. These were the principal celebrations, but Initiations were also performed at many smaller fes- tivals held during the year. The Palace of Thor, the principal place of Initia- tions, contained five hundred and forty halls and was situated in the kingdom of Thurdwanger. The Gothic Mysteries, like all others, were con- nected with the Mystery Myth, differing only in de- tail. The Gothic version runs as follows: Balder, who was esteemed as invulnerable, had in the general asisembly placed himself in sport as a mark at which the gods exercised their skill in casting darts. Odin and Friga exacted an oath of safety in favor of Balder from everything in nature except the mistletoe, which was omitted on account of its weakness. Loki dis- covered the exception and placed a sprig in the hands of the blind Hoder, persuaded him to cast it at Balder, who fell, pierced through with mortal wounds. His body was then placed in a boat and set afloat on the water, while the gods mourned for his decease. \"The fable of Balder and Loki,\" says Dr. Oliver, \"with the lamentations of the gods for the death of Balder, bears such an obvious relation to those of Osiris and Typhon, Bacchus and the Titans, Cama, Iswara, etc., that I entertain no doubt but that it constituted the Legend of Initiation; as it is, indeed, the exact coun-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Druidical, Gothic, Grecian, and Jewish Mysteries 55 terpart of all other systems of mysterious celebra- tion.\" (Ibid, p. 174, note 34.) It would be needless repetition to go into detail regarding these Initiations. Suffice it to say that after the candidate was duly prepared, by the usual fasting and the preliminary ceremonies of sacrifice, processions, etc., he was conducted with naked feet into the sacred hall and through a winding pathway, amid shades of darkness and the howling of dogs, to the tomb of the prophetess Volva. Here occured the mysterious rites of invocation. Passing onward the candidate hears the bewailings for the death of the God, Balder. He was then confined in the Pastos or tomb, and guarded by Heimdal, the door keeper of the Gods ; upon liberation he was instructed to search for the body of Balder, and to endeavor to raise him from death to life. Before starting on his dangerous expedition he was recommended to the protection of the Gods. The guide then conducted him through nine subterranean passages, where various experiments of awe and ter- ror awaited him. Completing his journey he entered the illuminated sacellum, and found Balder enthroned on a seat of highest distinction. His entrance was greeted with an anthem of congratulation, and great rejoicing took place for the resuscitation of the God. The candidate then took a solemn oath on a naked sword a symbol of the supreme God. Throughout the ceremonies the candidate had been impersonating Balder that is, his experiences were the same as Balder's, who, as a perfect Initiate, is the type or first fruits of human evolution. The candidate had then attained the Balder-state of manhood."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"56 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry THE GRECIAN MYSTERIES. The Mysteries were introduced into Greece by Or- pheus. This great Teacher evidently led one of the waves of emigration of the Aryan stock into Europe. The Orphic tradition had various fortunes. In the days of Homer it was neglected, for the people were too proud to listen to what they regarded as the su- perstition of their forefathers, but with the rise of philosophy in the seventh century B. C. the earlier religious Myths were again examined, and it became evident that ancient Greece possessed a Mystery-tra- dition which compared favorably with that of other nations. We do not know exactly the time when the Mys- tery institutions were established but we do know that they existed under various names Eleusinian, Bac- chic, Dionysiac, Samothracean, etc., and that all were practically the same. The Eleusinian were perhaps the most noted as they constituted what might be called the State Mysteries. In these there were two divisions the Lesser and the Greater, beyond which was the true Mystery of the Path. The center of the work of the Lesser Mysteries was at Agrae; the Greater at Eleusis. The Lesser Mysteries dealt prin- cipally with Hades or the Aistral world; the Great- er with the Mental or Heavenly world. The cere- monial garment in the Lesser Mysteries was a fawn skin; in the Greater Mysteries a golden-fleece, The candidates for Initiation were naturally divided into two classes those who were only capable of re- ceiving instruction in the things pertaining to the un- seen, and those who were capable of special training"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Druidical, Gothic, Grecian, and Jewish Mysteries 57 in the development of clairvoyance ; instruction was also given in cosmology, anthropogenesis, etc. The Eleusinian Mysteries were celebrated with much pomp and lasted nine days. The places of In- itiation, like those of other nations, were great sub- terranean caverns, containing many chambers and sep- ulchres in which the candidate was immured during a part of the ceremonial rite. Some of these places of Initiation, with their tombs cut into the solid rock, are described at length by Mr. Maundrill. Every temple had a cavern connected with it for Initiation. In some countries the place of Initiation was a pyr- amid erected over a subterranean cavern. The first portion of the ceremony among the Greeks was the purification by water. The candidate was then conducted to the vestibule and invested with the sacred robes, and after being exhorted to courage the aspirant was led through a series of caverns, where he met with practically the same experiences as we have found in the other Mysteries the dark and gloomy surroundings, the pealing thunder, the howl- ing dogs and wild beasts, the flashes of vivid light, monstrous appearances, etc. After three days of these terrors, he was confined in a cell for reflection. Dr. Oliver says, \"This was the symbolical death of the Mysteries; and the deliverance from confinement was the act of regeneration or new birth; and hence the rejuvenated aspirant was termed twice born; once from the womb of his natural mother and again from the pastos of Initiation.\" (Ibid, p. 98.) This deliverance was rather a resurrection than a new birth; the latter applying more properly to the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"58 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry first stage of Initiation, although, in one sense, every stage that marks an extension of consciousness is a new birth. While the aspirant was undergoing the mystical death of Bacchus, the Initiates acted out the Myth. We have seen that this passion-vision was a part of every mystery-drama. The neophyte here experi enced the Great Passion himself. This feeling was a prerequisite to knowing. What it was we do not know, but it had to do with the mystic death of the Master. During this part of the drama there were loud lamentations over the death of their God, and Rhea, like Isis, went in search of his remains. At a given signal from the Hierophant the mourn- ing was turned into joy, for it was announced that the body had been found and restored to life. The can- didate was liberated from his confinement, and after various experiences in the infernal regions, gained the verdant plains of Elysium, where the souls of the just were observed in the enjoyment of pure delights. Here the Hierophant delivered a lecture on the purpose of the Mysteries; gave the usual instruction in the secret science, and bestowed the insignia of the Order. Clement says of the Greek Mysteries, \"After these (the lustrations) are the minor Myster- ies, which have some foundation of instruction and of preliminary preparation for what is to come after; and the great Mysteries., in which noth- ing remains to be learned of the universe, but only to contemplate and comprehend nature and things,\" (Stromata, Book V, Ch. XL)"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Druidical, Gothic, Grecian, and Jewish Mysteries 59 The Bacchic or Dionysiac Mysteries grew to be mere festivities toward the last, and Bacchus himself re- garded as the god of wine, instead of the manifesta- tion of the Logos. The Mysteries of Greece and Rome shared the same decadence as the nations. We cannot judge them by their relics, any more than we can judge the grandeur of Rome by the period of her decay. Besides the public Mysteries there were the ancient schools of philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato, which have sometimes been called the private or philosophic Mysteries. The founders of these schools were In- itiates. Pythagoras is said to have been initialed into the Egyptian, Chaldean, Orphic and Eleusinian Mys- teries. These schools of philosophy worked in con- nection with the Mystery-teaching. It is a mistake to suppose that Pythagoras and Plato formulated a new doctrine, for their philosophy was part and par- cel of the old Wisdom which had been handed down by the Hierophants through the Mysteries. The genius of these great teachers consisted in clothing the great truths, enshrined in the ancient Myths, in modes of thought suitable to the time. In the Pytha- gorean schools the students were divided into three degrees or classes. The followers of Pythagoras were noted for purity of life and loftiness of aim and purpose, and the higher religious life of Greece is to be sought in this connection.

THE JEWISH MYSTERIES. The ancient Jews had their Mysteries, as well as all other peoples of antiquity. Mr. Elbe in his book (Future Life, p. 107) says that it appears to be an es- tablished fact that the Israelites had their Mysteries, as well as the Egyptians and the majority of ancient races. Although they had these secrets, occult knowledge and kabbalistic teaching, which passed form mouth to ear for generations among the Jewish Priests, as did the Brahrninical teaching before it was reduced to writing, yet we do not find the Jewish rites as elaborate as those practiced by other na- tions. The Jewish Kabbalistic doctrines were not written down until the first century of our era. Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai, com- piled the Kabbalistic teaching of his father into a work called the Zohar, but these teachings did not originate with that noted Rabbi, they reach far into remote antiquity. This book, which was edited be- tween 70 and 100 A. D., was lost, and its sacred con- tents were preserved only in a number of scattered manuscripts. The Zohar was rewritten, according to Munk, by Moses de Leon, in the I3th century, and was based upon those fragmentary manuscripts and ancient doc- uments which have been partially destroyed or lost to the general world. The Sepher Jetzerah (or Jewish Book of Creation) is first mentioned in the loth century, although its"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Druidical, Gothic, Grecian, and Jewish Mysteries 61 contents are very ancient. These two books, the Zo- har and Jetzerah, are the storehouse of all subsequent Kabbalistic works. The Kabbalistic writings, then, are comparatively modern, but their doctrines came to the Jews from the Chaldeans and Egyptians. Moses was an In- itiate, and knew the primitive universal mystery-lan- guage, also the numerical system on which it was based, but his writings have not come down to us the books attributed to him are not the original Mo- saic Records. The early Hebrew teachings derived from Moses had various fortunes the original scrolls were prob- ably lost and rewritten many times before the days of Ezra, and when the Jews were carried away into captivity, the Jewish Scriptures were destroyed. Ezra endeavored to restore them as best he could, but they have been tampered with even since his day. The Samaritans repudiate the Jewish canonical books. They are disfigured, they say, beyond all recognition by the Talmudists. They have their books of Moses, differing materially, yet claimed by the Samaritans to be carefully copied from the original. The Black Jews of Southern India know nothing of the captivity, thus proving that they emigrated pre- vious to 600 B. C. They also have a Book of Moses which differs greatly from either of the above canon- ical books. Although the Jews are right in declaring that Moses originally gave them their cosmology and laws, still the records of these laws have been so changed that the present books attributed to him are not the orig-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"62 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry inal books at all. Some fragments of the earlier writings and traditions may have been available at the time of Ezra, but in all probability the main alle- gories were taken from the symbolical records of the Chaldeans, as the earlier allegories had been adopt- ed from similar records in Egypt. The doctrine of the Kabbalah is practically the same as that of the ancient universal teaching. Ain Soph is the western and Semitic Parabrahman. Be- tween the Absolute Ain Soph and the Heavenly Man, there is an impersonal First Cause. Dr Ginsburg says, \"For to reveal itself to us, the concealed of all the concealed sent forth the Ten Emanations (Se- phoroth) called the Form of God, Form of the Heaven- ly Man. Yet since even; this luminous form was too dazzling for our vision, it had to put on another gar- ment, whkh is the universe. The universe, therefore, or the visible world, is a further expression of the Divine Substance, and is called in the Kabbalah, The Garment of God.\" This is the doctrine of the Vishnu Parana and in fact of all the schools. But it is not my purpose here to expound the teaching of the Mys- teries, so we must forego further comment. The Kabbalah is of value in throwing light upon the exoteric Hebrew books, although it has been so changed that it cannot be trusted to reveal the ancient teaching unless corroborated by other data. In the early times there Was a company of prophets at Naioth, Bethel, and Jericho, who formed schools of Initiates where the secret teaching was imparted to those who were qualified to hear.

It will be interesting here to consider these well known sects. THE ESSENES. For some centuries before the Christian era the Es- senean communities dwelt on the shores of the Dead Sea. Their chief characteristic was the doctrine of love love of God, love of virtue, and love of human kind. They lived a life of ascetic communism in which certain hours were devoted to the study of re- ligion the mysteries of nature and revelation. They had an inner instruction, an occult teaching, which was guarded with great secrecy. They were evidently in contact with Chaldean Kabbalism as they made much of the mysteries connected with the Tetragram- maton, the four lettered mystic name of Deity. The Essenes had their degrees and Initiations, in which we find the identity of teaching between Es- senism and Christianity is most marked. Mr. Mead sums up these points of contact somewhat as follows : Converts were required to sell their po- sessions and give to the poor, for the laying up of treasure was regarded as injurious to a spiritual life. Not only did the Essenes despise riches, but they lived a life of self-imposed poverty. Love of the brotherhood and of one's neighbor was the soul of Essene life, and the basis of all action; and this characteristic of their discipline called forth universal admiration. The members lived to- gether as a family, had all things in common, and ap-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"64 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry pointed a steward to manage the common purse. When traveling they would lodge with brethren whom they had never seen before, as though with the oldest and most intimate friends; and thus they took nothing with them when they went on a journey. All members were on the same level, and the authority of one over another was forbidden; nevertheless mutual service was mutually enjoined. They were also great lovers of peace, and so refused to take arms or manufacture warlike weapons; moreover they proscribed slavery. The ultimate aim of the Essenes was to be meek and lowly in spirit, to mortify all sinful lusts, to be pure in heart, to hate evil but reclaim the evil doer, and to be merciful to all men and moreover, their yea was to be yea, and their nay, nay. They were devoted to the curing of the sick and the healing of both body and soul, regarding the power to perform miraculous cures and cast out evil spirits as the highest stage of dis- cipline. In brief, they strove to be so pure as to be- come temples of the Holy Spirit, and thus seers and prophets. To these inner communities were attached outer circles of pupils living in the world, and found in all the main centres of the Diaspora. (Fragments of a Faith Forgotten, Mead, p. 134.) The Therapeutes were practically the same as the Es- senes with the exception, pointed out by Philo, that the latter were devoted to the practical life, while the former proceeded to the higher stages of the con- templative life. It would be interesting, did time permit, to give a full account of these Therapeutist communities, which were so like early Christianity that the Church Path-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Druidical, Gothic, Grecian, and Jewish Mysteries 65 ers always recognized them as Christians. Philo in his \"Contemplative Life,\" gives a full description of these \"Wisdom Lovers.\" Through their yearning for the blessed life they abandoned the world and sought some secluded spot, and gave themselves entirely to study and contemplation. In Egypt there were many in every Province, and especially around Alexandria. The most advanced joined the Mareotic colony, which was situated just south of Alexandria on a small plateau. The dwellings of this community were very simple, each containing a small chamber or closet in which, in solitude, they performed the mysteries of the holy life. Philo would lead us to believe that the Therapeutes were all Jews. This was probably true of the Mare- otic community with which he was connected as lay pupil, but this was only one of a vast number of such communities scattered all over the world. It is quite probable that many of these were as strongly tinged with Egyptian or Zoroastrian or Orphic elements as the one south of Alexandria was with Judaism. Many of these communities were purely eclectic com- bining traditions and elements of the various schools. THE PHARISEES. We are fairly familiar with the external side of Phariseeism the minute ceremonialism and elaborate rules of external piety but the inner side is not so well understood.

In the course of time it became"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"66 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry divided into many schools, the strictest of which led a life of internal piety. The highest aim of this school was to attain to such a state of holiness, as to be able to perform miraculous cures and to prophesy. The degrees of holiness practiced by this sect are given by Mr. Mead as follows: (i.) the study of the law and circumspection; (n.) the noviciate, in which the apron was a symbol of purity; (in.) external purity, by means of lustrations or baptisms; (IV.) celibacy; (V.) inward purity, purity of thought; (VI.) a still higher stage, which is not further defined; (VII.) meekness and holiness; (VIII.) dread of every sin; (IX.) the highest stage of holiness; (X.) the stage which enabled the adept to heal the sick and raise the dead. (Ibid, p. 133.) It is quite evident that there was a wide difference between the tenets of the Healers and the other Phar- isees who believed in the blood sacrifices of the Temple-worship and the resurrection of the physical body. This again illustrates the difference between the exoteric and esoteric cults. All these mystic schools constituted links in the chain of the Wisdom or Gnosis transmission. Jesus himself taught nothing new, he merely illuminated the traditions of the Gnosis, and in his public teaching practically threw open to all some of the intermediate grades of the Mysteries. The Jews, then, in common with all the ancient nations, were in possession of an occult teaching, which is the same old Wisdom Re- ligion, that has ever stood as the background of the popular religious systems."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Druidical, Gothic, Grecian, and Jewish Mysteries 67 The distinction sometimes made between re- ligions that the Jewish and Christian are pure, and that the Pagan is spurious, is an error due to a very narrow conception. The higher criticism and recent study of comparative religions has shown us that we can no longer hold to the belief in one perfect su- pernatural religion, condemning all others as false. That God left the world to wander in darkness until two, three or four thousand years ago is contra- dicted by every Sage, and by the great body of re- ligious literature that preceded the Jewish and Chris- tian eras. God is no respecter of persons, therefore no religion has a monopoly of truth. Each great World-Faith has a part to play in the Divine Economy. While we recognize Jesus as the great Initiate and Messenger to the Western world, let us not ignore the other Divine Teachers whom God has sent as Mes- sengers from the same Great Lodge. The same Wis- dom illuminated them all they are all kindred and be- long to the same Great Brotherhood. Limited time has prevented me from going into greater details regarding the ceremonies of Initiation. Enough, however, has been said to bear out the fact that all the Mysteries of antiquity have a common or- igin. They bear the most striking resemblance to each other both in ceremonies and doctrines. Thus, we have seen that Initiations in all the Mysteries were set forth in a Mystery-Myth, sometimes called the Sun-Myth, which in its various settings symbolizes the activity of the Logos, on the one hand, and the mystic life of the Initiate on the other. The hero of the Myth, representing the Solar Logos and the Perfect Initiate, was known by different names in different"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"68 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry countries Osiris-Horus in Egypt, Ormazd-Mithra in Persia, Zeus-Hermes in Greece, Jupiter-Ammon in Rome, Thor-Balder in Britain and Scandinavia. The Initiates knew the real meaning of these Myths, for literally the Sun is not born and does not die, nor is it raised from the dead. The recitals of these events are allegories, which veil a deeper truth. In the popular religions the Sun became the object of worship, and the Hero of the Myths became the God of the various religions when the symbol was mistaken for the thing symbolized. The Myth is an allegory of the activity of the Logos in the Cosmos, and of the various stages of Initiation, and like all the rites, it typifies the mystic life of every Initiate. Every per- fected Master becomes a Christ, a Hermes, etc. In- itiation consists in attaining the Master-state. A fail- ure to understand these symbols and allegories resulted in the crude dogmas of popular theology. Many have read this later thought into the Mysteries themselves, and have supposed that the rites merely symbolized the death and resurrection of some Hero or Demi-God some special divine personage who was considered by the celebrants as a God. According to this the aspir- ant was merely representing the death and resurrection of the God from whom, the Mysteries derived their name. This crude conception falls far short of the reality, for the cosmic aspect of all these religious trag- edies was symbolized by the activity of the Logos in the universe, but these Sun-Myths also typify the mystic life of the Initiate. The Initiate did not merely represent some Hero, he was the Hero himself, and the rites typified what he became a Buddha, a Christ, a Mithra, etc., one whose mystic life repre-"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Druidical, Gothic, Grecian, and Jewish Mysteries 69 sented the mystic lives of all who had previously trod the path, though that was not the primary significance of the ceremony. Perhaps after the Mysteries became corrupt and de- graded, so-called Initiates might have mis-read the al- legories and symbols, but such was not the case in the days of the real Initiates before the key to the Sacred Science was lost. The use of the image, in some instances employed to represent the candidate, evidently came into use when the Institution had become so changed that the candidate objected to being laid away in the tomb, as was originally the custom, and another indication of decline was the physical terror to which the candidate was subjected. This was to test his courage and was supposed to illustrate the experiences he would meet in the invisible world. In the early days, we are told, the candidate was en- tranced when laid away in the tomb, he then actually visited the invisible world and encountered the gro- tesque images and forms to be seen there. He was taught the \"words of power\" and the \"signs of power,\" although they were only a means of strengthening the will, which alone, however, is sufficient to overcome the phantomed terrors. The Hierophant also used his occult power to materialize illustrations of various postmortem conditions. That the Mysteries were designed to reveal the in- visible world, is clearly stated by Plutarch, who was himself an Initiate of high standing.

Thus in the terms, 'to die' and 'to be In- itiated' we have an exact correspondence, word to word and fact to fact. First of all there are wanderings and weary journey ings and paths on which we look with suspicion, and that seem to have no termination; then, before the end, every kind of terror, shuddering, trembling, sweating, stupor. But at last a marvelous light shines out to meet us, pure scenes and fair fields welcome us, with song and dance and the solemnities of sacred sounds and holy sights. In which state he who has already perfected himself in all things, and received Initiation, accomplishes his mystery, reaches his full freedom, and passing everywhere at will, he re- ceives the crown, and is in communion with the holy and pure ; now gazing down upon the unpurified multitude of the uninitiated who are still in life, wallowing in the deep mire and mist, and abiding in misery from fear of death and want of faith in the blessedness of the soul-life. (Plut. Frag. V. 9 ed. Didot.} The vision of Aridaeus^ also given by Plutarch was, according to Mead, either a literary subterfuge for describing some of the instruction in certain Mysteries, or a partial description of the invisible world and the conditions of the soul after death, although, as we have said, the former was a revelation of the latter. But when the power to directly reveal the future state was lost, they had to illustrate it by dramatic and scenic representations. To produce the ghostly images and phantoms in the physical plane Mysteries, actors, and even mirrors were often used not as a deception, however, for everybody understood that these were illustrations only."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Druidical, Gothic, Grecian, and Jewish Mysteries 71 With the loss of the higher means of revelation, corruption gradually crept in and man at last was left to win his deliverance without the visible aid of the Great Teachers, yet we are assured by wise preceptors that those great souls remain constant, even though unseen, and are ever ready to aid and assist the needy whenever they comply with the great occult law of the universe. THE DECLINE OF THE MYSTERIES. The cause of the decline of the Mysteries was the personal ambition of crafty priests and despotic rulers. They began to lose this grandeur and glory before the days of Aristotle, their retrogression, however, was gradual ; for at the time of Cicero they retained much of their early sanctity and purity, and even as late as the time of Nero, for as unscrupulous as he be- came he did not dare to aid in the celebra- tion of the Mysteries after commiting a hideous crime. The great occult knowledge which had moved westward for thousands of years began about 500 B. C. to recede to its Eastern sourse. Owing to the Ethiopian invasion 570 B. C., the royal throne fell into the hands of Amases, a man of low birth, who destroyed the priestly order. It is not strange, that in the decadence of Greece and Rome, even the Mysteries should share in the general degra- dation. Selfishness ruled with an iron hand and be- fore the end of the Roman Empire, the true spirit of the Mysteries was withheld, leaving only the outer forms behind.

The Christian Religion, in common with all the great religions of antiquity, originally possessed an in- ner or occult teaching. W. J. B.

In the first degree of Christianity the can- didate was baptized. Baptism introduced the be- liever to the Christian Mystery. The sacred doctrines taught in the several degrees were those of the 'Trinity in Unity/ the 'Incarnation of the Logos or Son of God,' 'the Crucifixion,' 'the Resur- rection,' and the 'Secret of the Liturgy.'

Before we examine the records to see if this con- tention can be substantiated, let us first note something of the Christian movement. The origin of Christi- anity is involved in great obscurity. Even the period at which Jesus lived is a matter of controversy. The following occult account accords with the Talmud in stating that Jesus lived in the days of King Jannai, who reigned over the Jews 104 to 78 B. C., and is as follows : \"The child whose Jewish name has been turned into that of Jesus was born in Palestine, B. C. 105, during the consulate of Publicus Rutilus Rufus and Gnaeus Mallius Maximus. His parents were well-born though poor, and he was educated in a knowledge of the Hebrew Scriptures. His fervent devotion and a gravity beyond his years led his par- ents to dedicate him to the religious and ascetic life, and, soon after a visit to Jerusalem, in which the ex- traordinary intelligence and eagerness for knowledge of the youth were shown in his seeking of the doctors in the Temple, he was sent to be trained in an Essene community in the southern Judean desert. When he had reached the age of nineteen he went on to the Es- sene Monastery near Mount Serbal, a monastery which was much visited by learned men traveling from Per- sia and India to Egypt, and where a magnificent li- brary of occult works many of them Indian of the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries Trans-Himalayan regions had been established. From this seat of mystic learning he proceeded later to Egypt. He had been fully instructed in the secret teachings which were the real fount of life among the Essenes, and was initiated in Egypt as a disciple of that one Sublime Lodge from which every great re- ligion has its Founder. For Egypt has remained one of the world centres of the true Mysteries, whereof all semi-public Mysteries are the faint and far-off reflections. The Mysteries spoken of in history as Egyptian, were the shadows of the true things 'in the Mount,' and there the young Hebrew received the solemn consecration which prepared him for the Royal Priesthood he was later to attain.\" (Esoteric Christi- anity Besant, p. 128 & 129.) The time having come for the founding of a new religion, a suitable tabernacle was needed for the Great Teacher who was to be sent into the world. Jesus of- fered his body as a willing sacrifice. One called the Christ took possession of Jesus' body at the age of 29, and for two years instructed the heads of the Es- sene communities, and for one year he taught the general public. It is only of the last year's work that some tradition is preserved for us in the Gospel story. He was finally rejected by the Essenes because he car- ried to the outer world some portions of the spiritual wisdom which they regarded as their exclusive possess- ion. The clouds of hatred thickened until finally the body of Jesus paid the penalty for enshrining the Great Teacher. But the Master did not forget his promise to return to his chosen disciples, and for some fifty years he visited them in his spiritual body, and con- tinued his instruction in the secret teaching. This in-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"76 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry ner instruction constituted the basis of the Christian Mysteries. During this time the disciples lived to- gether in a retired spot on the outskirts of Judea, at- tracting small attention because of the many similar communities. During its embryonic stage the new re- ligion was hidden in the womb of communities, similar to that of the Therapeutes. It was some years before it emerged and began its general propaganda, and it was only when the disciples were fully prepared that they went forth to preach. After Jesus' death he completed his human evolution .and became a Perfect Master. The Christ then sur- rendered to Jesus the care of the Christian Church, and He became the Hierophant in the Christian Mys- teries. He was the inspiration that kept alive the Gnosis in the Church until the mass of ignorant self- ishness became too great for its continuance. But he has sought thoroughout the centuries, and is seeking to-day, for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear Wisdom. (For full exposition see \"Esoteric Christianity,\" Besant, Ch. IV.) This is the occult teaching, which is fully corrobor- ated by the doctrine of the early Gnostics. They held that those whom Christ originally instructed in the higher doctrines, brought about his condemnation for blasphemy by the Orthodox Jewish authorities, be- cause they considered that his too open teaching was a divulgence of the Mysteries. They also held, as can be seen by consulting the Pistis Sophia, written by Valentinus, that after Jesus' death he continued his instruction of the disciples. For eleven years he taught them so far as \"the regions of the first statues"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries 77 only and up to the regions of the first mystery, the mystery within the veil.\" Notwithstanding, there were omissions of many points which as yet they were unable to comprehend, the instruction was so wonderful that they thought that all had been revealed, the gnosis of all gnoses. In the twelfth year, having received the robe of glory, he says to his disciples \"Lo, I have put on My vesture, and all power hath been given Me by the First Mystery. Yet a little while and I will tell you the mystery of the pleroma and the pleroma of the pleroma; I will conceal nothing from you from this hour, but in perfectness will I perfect you in the whole pleroma, and all perfection, and every mystery ; which things, indeed, are the perfection, of all perfections, the pleroma of all pleroma, and the gno- sis of all gnoses, which are in My vesture. I will tell you all mysteries from the exterior of the exteriors, to the interior of the interiors.\" This the Master did and instructed them in the Mystery of the First Mys- tery and the Mystery of the Ineffable. Then follows instruction on the nature of the preaching by the dis- ciples when the Master has entered the Light, and the condition upon which the Mysteries shall be given to others. He then teaches them regarding the postmor- tem state of the sinner, the righteous uninitiated, and the righteous initiated, etc. This secret teaching con- stituted the Mysteries of Jesus. The public and private teaching of Jesus naturally resulted in two traditions. The mystic tradition repre- sents the inner teaching, and the Ebionite represents the public teaching. It was against the original fol- lowers of the public tradition that Paul contended in his efforts to universalize Christianity. The Petro-"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"78 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Pauline controversy was a struggle between the exter- nal and mystic sides of the new movement. The Ebionites undoubtedly preserved the original and true tradition regarding the birth and nature of Jesus, for they held that Jesus was a. man born as other men, the natural son of Joseph and Mary. That the tradi- tion of the Ebionites or Nazaraens differed widely from the historicized dogmas of later times, may be seen, even to-day, from the Codex Nasarseus of the Mandaites, the descendants of the Nazaraeans who dwell in the marshes of Southern Babylonia. We must not confuse the early form of Ebionitism with the later forms which were of a Gnostic nature the outer communities being finally influenced by the inner Jew- ish tradition. Paul himself was a mystic, in touch with the inner communities, and he saw that Christianity was de- signed to be the religion of the new race about to be born. It is evident that Paul was not acquainted with the later accounts of the canonical Gospels, for he does not teach the historical Jesua but the Mystic Christ. The canonical accounts were probably compiled in the last quarter of the first century or in the first part of the second, that is, they reached their present form at that time. The synoptics were based upon a sketch of an ideal life, written by one of the Apos- tles of the inner communities, and intended for gen- eral circulation. Round this nucleus, later compilers, bishops of the outer churches, wove much other mat- ter which was selected from a mass of legend and tra- dition. Orthodoxy or General Christianity traces its origin to these documents. We are now ready to examine the teachings of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries _ o Jesus and the Apostles, and see if we can find any trace or reference to an inner occult teaching. Upon reading an account of Jesus' teaching we find him constantly making use of certain terms which are usually employed to designate an inner circle of In- itiation. In the fourth chapter of Mark is recorded the par- able of the sower, given by Jesus to the multitude, at the conclusion of which he said, \"He that hath ears to hear let him hear.\" \"And when he was alone,\" the writer says, \"they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable,\" and He said unto them, \"Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God ; but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables.\" (Mark, IV., 9, 10, n). A little later in the same chapter we are told, \"With many such parables spake He the word unto them, as they were able to hear it. But without a parable spake he not unto them, and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples.\" (Ibid, 33, 34.) The writer records the intellectual inter- pretation of the parable of the sower given by Jesus to his disciples. These things have a three-fold mean- ing a surface, an intellectual interpretation, and a mystical or spiritual meaning, which was never writ- ten but was committed orally by the teacher to his pledged disciple. Origen says all Scripture has a body, the common historical sense ; a soul, a figurative meaning to be intellectually discerned; and a spirit, an inner occult sense, known only to the spiritually minded. It was this inner occult teaching that Jesus gave to those \"in the house when they were alone,\" to those who were privileged to \"know the mysteries of the kingdom of God.\""},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"80 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry The Kingdom of Heaven or Kingdom of God re- fers to the Mystery-Institution or to the spiritual state which, the discipline and knowledge or Gnosis re- vealed in the Mysteries, enabled one to attain. In the Pistis Sophia Jesus is said to have brought the \"Keys of the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Light,\" meaning that the perfect Initiate had attained the Kingdom, the high spiritual state, even while on earth. In the \"Book of the Great Logos,\" another early Gnostic treatise, we are told that those who have received the Greater Mysteries, the Mysteries of the Light Treasure, \"have already inherited the Kingdom of God while still on earth ; they have their share in the Light Treasure and are immortal Gods.\" We see by this the real meaning of Jesus' saying, \"Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine/' (Matt. VII., 6.) \"Dogs\" like \"the vulgar\" and \"the profane\" was a term applied by those within a certain circle, to all who were on the outside. This was the sense in which Jesus used the terms; for those not initiated into the mysteries of the knowledge could not understand the inner teaching; and to give it to them would be like casting pearls before swine. Again the names \"Kingdom,\" the \"Kingdom of God\" or the \"Kingdom of Heaven,\" the \"Strait Gate\" the \"Narrow Way,\" the \"Saved,\" are all technical terms connected with Initiation and the Mysteries. This is evident from the passages in which these terms occur. The question was asked Jesus, \"Are there few that be saved?\" and he replied, \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\" (Luke XIII, 23, 24.) Again, he said, \"Enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\" (Matt., VII, 13, 14.) The application of this passage to the future world is without foundation. To suppose that many will earnestly seek to enter heaven but will be unable to gain admission is both unreasonable and unscriptural. When the Seer of the Apocalypse describes the heaven- world he does not behold merely a few, but a \"great multitude which no man could number.\" (Rev. VIL, 9.) The \"Strait Gate\" here is not the gateway of heaven, but the gateway of Initiation. Few, indeed, have succeeded in entering this \"Strait Gate,\" al- though many have sought its portals. There are some, even to-day, who can bear witness to this state- ment, some who for years have striven but have not yet reached the goal. The \"Saved,\" the true Initiates, those who have attained the \"Kingdom,\" or spiritual Nirvana, have always been few. Some three thousand years earlier, Krishna said, \"Among thousands of men, scarce one striveth for perfection; of the suc- cessful strivers scarce one knoweth me in essence.\" The great multitude have always followed the broad way which leadeth time and again to destruction ; only the few have sought the narrower and steeper road of Initiation that leadeth direct unto life. The student of the worlds' Scriptures is familiar"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"g2 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry with the symbol of the \"Narrow Way.\" It is the old narrow way so often referred to, the \"Path diffi- cult to tread as the edge of a razor.\" Jesus does not use the symbol in any new sense. It is the old '\"'Strait Gate\" and \"Narrow Way\" of Initiation. This was symbolized in the Ancient Mysteries by the nar- row stone orifice which separated each of the seven caverns from its successor, and through which the can- didate had to pass in going from one chamber to the next. The King's Chamber in the great Pyramid was entered through such a gate. Regarding this Mr. Stans- land Wake says, \"The so-called King's Chamber. . . . was probably the place to which the Initiate was ad- mitted after he had gone through the narrow upward passage, and the grand gallery with its lowly termina- tion which gradually prepared him for the final stage of the Sacred Mysteries.\" (Origin and Significance of the Great Pyramids,\" p. 93.) This passage sym- bolized the \"Narrow\" or \"Strait Gate\" which \"leadeth unto life\" the new spiritual rebirth to which Jesus referred. It was a symbol, the meaning of which was well understood by every Initiate. The Mason will recall a similar symbol in the gateway through which he passed in the Royal Arch Degree. It is of interest to note, in this connection, the in- cident of the young man who came to Jesus and ad- dressing him said, \"Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal Life?\" He wished to secure a permanent abode in that world where they die no more, in other words, he was seeking liberation frofn the necessity of repeated births and deaths. Re- member, the Jews believed that all imperfect souls returned to earth life. In reply Jesus gave the usual"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries 83 exoteric answer, \"Keep the commandments.\" But when the young man said he had kept all these from his youth up, Jesus said to him, \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hath and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me.\" (Matt. XIX., 21.) To be \"Perfect\" is to attain a certain stage of In- itiation. Jesus here uses a technical term, the mean- ing of which was well known at that tirrre. The Es- senes used the term to denote a certain class in their communites. They had three divisons the Neo- phytes, the Brethren and the Perfect. If thou wilt be \"Perfect,\" a member of the Kingdom, you must comply with the conditions poverty and obedience. Such has always been a condition for Initiation. When the young man heard the necessity of this he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions. Jesus then turned to his disciples and moralized upon the dif- ficulties that stand in the way of a rich man entering upon the higher stages of human evolution, saying, \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. (Ibid 24.) To apply this to the future state is ab- surd. Does anyone really believe that no rich man can enter heaven ? There seems to be no great haste in get- ting rid of riches on account of the text. But when we understand that the \"Kingdom of Heaven\" means the \"Brotherhood of the Initiated,\" we see at once that the statement is literally true. One cannot gain that knowledge of God which is eternal life, the condition of the \"Perfect,\" while engrossed with the cares of great wealth. It is only when one is stripped of these cares and anxieties, incident upon the possession of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"84 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry great riches and vast interests in the material world, that he can pass the narrow gateway of the world of the spirit. Poverty, obedience, and chastity were the vows taken by the candidate for Initiation in all ages, and Jesus simply repeats the universal teaching. Another indication of Jesus' knowledge of the tech- nical terms of Initiation is in the words spoken to Nic- odemus, \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.\" (John HI, 3.) This birth or baptism is spoken of as of water and of the spirit, the first baptism is the first Initiation, when the candidate is welcomed as a \"little child.\" There was a later Initiation, the baptism of the Initiate, in his manhood, called; the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire. (Matt. Ill, n.) In the Codex Nasaraeus of the Mandaites there is a beautiful story of this mystic baptism. Jesus conies to Johannah to be baptized seeking Initiation into the the mystic school of Johannah. But Johannah recog- nizes him as the Master by whose power he had been teaching and initiating for forty and two years. Jo- hannah gives the lower Initiation of external baptism to Jesus, and receives in turn the true spiritual bap- tism from the Master himself, when \"He gave him the grip of the Rushta, and laid his hand upon him in Jordan ; and He made him lay off his garment of flesh and blood ; and He clothed him in a raiment of glory.\" The phrases \"little ones,\" \"little child\" and \"children.\" were used in the mystic circles of the time to denote one just Initiated. Johannah says, \"Come in peace, Little One Now, I go with thee, Little One, that we may enter the stream. . . . Come, come, Little"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries 85 One of three years and one day, youngest among his brethren but oldest with his Father, who is so small yet his sayings are so exalted.\" In the Essene and Therapeute communities senority was reckoned not by age, but by the years the brother had been a mem- ber of the Order. The \"Second Birth\" is also a well recognized and universal term for Initiation. This will be clearly seen when we consider more definitely the question of Initiation in a succeeding lecture. On the night preceding his death, Jesus said to his Apostles, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" (John XVI, 12.) Some of these things were undoubtedly said by Jesus after his resurrection, during the period when he remained with his disciples, \"Speaking to them of the things per- taining to the Kingdom of God.\" Of course, none of these things pertaining, as they did, to the \"Kingdom of God\" the Mysteries are publicly recorded; but one cannot doubt that they were treasured and handed down orally as a precious heritage. There is a tradi- tion in the early church that this instruction continued, not only forty days, but for many years. We will now turn to St. Paul. We shall find the writings of this Apostle to the Gentiles permeated with references to occult teachings and the Mysteries; his use of the technical terms connected with Initiation is sufficient to prove, to any unprejudiced mind, the existence of the inner teaching of the Church in its primitive state. In the first Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul refers to the degree of \"Perfection\" and to the teaching that belongs to that degree; he says, \"We speak wisdom"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"86 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry among them that are perfect. . . We speak the wis- dom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory: which none of the princes of this world knew. . . But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit : for the spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. . . Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.\" (/ Cor. n, 6, 7, 10, 13.) \"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat ; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal .... Asa wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation.\" (/ Cor. III., i, 2, 3, 10.) \"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.\" (I Cor. IV, i.) Is it not evident from these passages that the Apos- tle possessed an inner wisdom that the Christians at Corinth were not yet able to receive ? Remember that these words were addressed to those who were in full membership of the Church. They had all that the modern church gives to its members, but there was a hidden wisdom which they could not yet bear. This wisdom was only given in the Mysteries where wis- dom was spoken among the \"Perfect.\" The recurring technical terms in these passages should evidence their connection with the world-wide Mysteries : The \"Per- fect,\" the \"Wisdom,\" the \"Hidden Wisdom,\" the \"Wis- dom of God in a Mystery,\" the \"wise Master-builder,\""},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries 87 \"Stewards of the Mysteries of God\" Paul constantly uses these technical terms which belong to the mystic tradition. The communities which he addressed must have been familiar with his nomenclature, for he does not speak; of these things as new, but as well known to those to whom he writes. In the Epistle to the Ephesians Paul refers to the Mysteries, saying that by \"revelation he made known unto me the mystery,\" \"my knowledge in the mystery of Christ\" that all men might see the \"fellowship of the mystery.\" (Eph. Ill, 3, 4, 9.) In the Epistle to the Colossians, Paul declares that he had been made a minister to fulfill the word of God, \"Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints : To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles ; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.\" (Col. I, 26-27.) This Christ within is indeed a mystery it is the life of the Initiate, which, when fully developed, will present the man \"perfect in Jesus Christ.\" In the Epistle to the Philippians Paul says, \"I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. . . That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death : If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect. . . Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.\" (Phil. Ill, 8-15.)"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"88 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry The resurrection which the Apostle was striving to attain was not the ordinary resurrection of Christian belief, for this requires no effort. But there is a \"re- surrection\" which is not easily attained. Jesus refers to this in his reply to the Sadducees, \"But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage : neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels; and are children of God, being the children of the resurrection.\" (Luke XX, 35, 36.) Jesus here connects the resurrection with liberation from death those attaining the resurrection \"do not die any more.\" The perfected Initiate was liberated from the \"circle of generations\" of birth and death, he was worthy to obtain that world of permanent abode. The real man is sexless and those who are able to abandon their animal nature, return to the eter- nal essence above, where there is neither male nor fe- male, but a new creature this is the true resurrection. When the neophyte reached a certain stage of interior development or enlightment he was said to \"rise from the dead.\" The phrase \"resurrection from the dead\" is a mystical phrase denoting the new birth or Gno- stic Illumination. The Apostle was striving to attain that resurrection, and he urges \"as many as are per- fect\" to strive also. He does not urge the ordinary believer; for only those who had attained to the de- gree of the \"Perfect\" could hope for immediate de- liverance. He was already of the \"Perfect\" and he says to his fellow Initiates, \"I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

But when they had conquered the lower nature and were no longer 'carnal,' then they were to enter on a higher path, and were themselves to become Christ.\" (Esoteric Christianity, Besant, p. 63.) Paul had struggled to attain this ideal and had at last succeeded. He says, \"I am now ready to be of- fered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.\" (// Timothy, IV, 6-8.. \"This was the crown given 'to him that overcometh,' of whom it is said .by the ascended Christ: 'I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God; and he shall go no more out.\" (Rev.

In the First Epistle to Timothy, Paul exhorts his son in the faith to see that nothing is done contrary to sound doctrine. Paul declares that the glorious gospel of the blessed God has been committed to his trust, and he commits to Timothy an important charge in this connection. \"This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy.\" (/ Timothy, L, 18.) And again he says, \"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust.\" (Ibid VI., 20.) \"Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me that good thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"90 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Ghost which dwelleth in us.\" (// Timothy I., 13, 14.) \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery\" of the Initiates. (/ Timothy IV., 14.) This knowledge which had been committed to Timothy and which he was to guard so completely, was not the common knowledge possessed by Christians in general, there was no special obligations laid upon him regard- ing that, but it was the doctrine committed to his trust as an Initiate. Paul instructs him to select deacons from among those who had a knowledge of the \"mystery of the Faith,\" and the \"mystery of godliness.\" He was fur- ther to provide for the transmission of this sacred teaching, \"the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses [in the assembly of Initiates], the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\" (//. Timothy, II, 2.) This, of course, refers to the sacred oral teachings given only to Initiates. If the ordinary doctrines of the church were meant, Timothy would have been in- structed to write it down for transmission, or rather Paul would have written it out himself. But the secret teaching could not be written; they were not the things read by Timothy, they were Paul's private instructions, given within the sacred precincts; they were to be transmitted to others by word of mouth. Paul initiates Timothy into the Mysteries of the Church, and exhorts him to \"keep that which is com- mitted to his trust,\" and to provide for the due trans- mission of this knowledge to other teachers.

In the last lecture we examined the testimonies of Christ and His Apostles, and found that they had an inner teaching, a deep spiritual knowledge, which was not imparted to the masses. We shall now proceed to the history of the early church in which we find that the Mysteries, as es- tablished by Christ, constituted a definite institution in the early Christian centuries. There were two traditions of the Christian Gnosis the Gnostic, which recognized the Christian Gnosis as only a part of the General Gnosis, and the ortho- dox, which held to the exclusive character of the Christian Gnosis. Let us first consider the Gnostics. The very mean- ing of the word Gnostic is to know. The Gnostics were the first philosophers and theologians of the Christian Church; they had an inner esoteric teach- ing which they claimed came direct from Jesus and the Apostles. These philosophers were not only the most cultured in the Christian ranks, but were zeal- ous workers in their faith; they endeavored to for- mulate Christianity as a universal philosophy. They lived strictly and followed the path of righteousness,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries 93 striving by every means to purify themselves and to realize by daily practice the teachings of the Master, seeking always the science of realities the knowl- edge of God, hence wisdom was their goal and spir- itual things their study.

Until the middle of the second cen- tury, at least, they continued a part of the General Christian body, but at last the narrowness and bigotry of those who followed the outer tradition succeeded in having them denounced as heretics ; and this chiefly for contending that the teachings of Christ contained a wisdom that transcended the comprehension of the multitude. The Gnostics had their Mysteries and Initiations. Even in the recently discovered \"Acts of John\" we have a fragment of the early Gnostic ritual of the Mysteries ; there is also mention of some of the de- grees such as the \"Initiation of the Cross,\" and in the \"Pistis Sophia,\" the \"Books of the Savior,\" and the \"Book of the Great Logos,\" there is constant mention of the Mysteries. The Christian Mysteries, like the Eleusinian, were divided into two parts, the Lesser and the Greater. Beside the Greek original Gnostic works above mentioned, we have some Gnostic fragments recov- ered from the polemical writings of the Church Fathers, but as these writers were the most bitter op- ponents of the Gnostics they are not a very accurate source of information.

I regret that space does not permit an extended ex- amination of this much neglected field of original Christian mysticism, but as all admit the existence of a Gnostic Gnosis, it will not be necessary to go into further details. Let us now look at the Orthodox Gnosis. This rep- resents the narrower stream, if not in volume at least in exclusiveness, and though the later Church fath- ers condemned the followers of this tradition equally with the Gnostics, for some centuries it had a wide following among the more intelligent of the early church. We will trace this tradition more fully: Polycarp, a fellow disciple with Ignatius and St. John, in his Epistle to the Church at Philippi, writes, \"I trust that ye are well versed in the Sacred Scriptures, and that nothing is hid from you, but to me this privilege is not yet granted.\" (Anti Nicene Fathers, Am. Ed. Vol. i, p. 35.) It is evident from this that there was a hidden teaching in which Polycarp was not yet in- structed, for he trusts that those to whom he writes are farther advanced, that there is nothing hid from them, so Polycarp evidently was not yet a full In- itiate. In the Epistle to Barnabas its writer says, \"If I should take the trouble to communicate to you some portion of what I have myself received, it would prove to me a sufficient reward that I minister to"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries 95 such spirits.\" (Epistle to Barnabas, Ch. i.) It is clear from this that Barnabas had received instruc- tion in addition to that possessed by those to whom he wrote. Ignatius, in his Epistle to the Ephesians, writes, \"I know both who I am and to whom I write. . . Ye are initiated into the mysteries of the Gospel with Paul, the holy, the martyred, inasmuch as he was a 'chosen vessel.\"' (Ch. XII.) In the Epistle of Ig- natius to the Trallians, he says, \"For might not I write to you things more full of mystery? But I fear to do so, lest I should inflict injury on you who are but babes. Pardon me in this respect, lest, as not being able to receive their weighty import, ye should be strangled by them. For even I, though I am bound (for Christ) and am able to understand heav- enly things, the angelic orders, and the different sorts of Angels and hosts, the distinctions between powers and dominions, and the diversities between thrones and authorities, the mightiness of the Aeons, and the pre- eminence of the cherubim and seraphim, the sublimity of the spirit, the Kingdom of the Lord, and, above all, the incomparable majesty of Almighty God though I am acquainted with these things, yet I am not there- fore by any means perfect; nor am I such a disciple as Paul or Peter.\" (Ch. V.) This passage is important as showing that the Mys- teries dealt with \"heavenly things,\" the \"angelic or- ders,\" etc. In his \"Epistle to the Philadelphians\" he says, \"The priests indeed are good, but the High Priest [Hiero- phant] is better; to whom the holy of holies has been"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"96 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry committed, and who alone has been trusted with the secrets of God.\" (Ch.

But it is reasonable not to leave even those who are not yet initiated with- out assistance. . . And when it remains that the catechumen is to be baptized, let him learn what con- cerns the renunciation of the devil, and the joining of himself with Christ; for it is fit that he should first abstain from things contrary, and then be admitted to the Mysteries.

Again in speaking of \"The Mysteries of the faith not to be divulged to all,\" he says, \"But since this tradition is not published alone for him who per- ceives the magnificence of the word; it is requisite, therefore, to hide in a mystery the wisdom spoken, which the Son of God taught. Now, therefore, Isaiah the prophet has his tongue purified by fire, so that he may be able to tell the vision. And we must purify not the tongue alone, but also the ears, if we attempt to be partakers of the truth. Such were the impedi- ments in the way of my writing. And even now I fear, as it is said, 'to cast the pearls before swine, lest they tread them under foot, and turn and rend us.' For it is difficult to exhibit the really pure and trans- parent words respecting the true light, to swinish and untrained hearers, for scarcely would anything which they could hear be more ludicrous than these to the multitude; nor any subjects, on the other hand, more admirable or more inspiring to those of noble nature. 'But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him.' But the wise do not utter with their mouth what they rea- son in council.

Again, he says, \"He who is still blind and dumb, not having understanding, or the undazzled and keen vision of the contemplative soul, which the Savior con- fers, like the uninitiated at the mysteries, or the un- musical at dances, not being yet pure and worthy of the pure truth but still discordant and disordered and material, must stand outside of the divine choir. 'For we compare spiritual things with spiritual.' Wherefore, in accordance with the method of con- cealment, the truly sacred Word, truly divine and most necessary for us, deposited in the shrine of truth, was by the Egyptians indicated by what were called among them Adyta, and by the Hebrews by the Veil.

Thence the prophecies and oracles are spoken in enigmas, and the mysteries are not exhibited incontinently to all and sundry, but only after certain purifications and previous instructions.\" (The Stromata, Book V, Ch. IV.) Clement then takes up the symbolic and allegorical method of writing employed by the philosophers, and quotes many passages from the Scriptures to show that Jesus and the Apostles employed the same meth- od. \"The apostle in contradistinction to gnostic per- fection,\" he says, \"calls the common faith the founda- tion and sometimes milk.\" He speaks of the build- ing as the \"gnostic superstructure\" or \"gnostic edi-"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"100 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry fice\" and says, \"it was impossible that gifts of this sort could be written without disguise.\" \"But,\" he con- tinues, \"the Gnostic apprehends. Now, then, it is not wished that all things should be exposed indis- criminately to all and sundry, or the benefits of wis- dom communicated to those who have not even in a dream been purified in soul (for it is not allowed to hand to every chance tromer what has been procured with such laborious efforts) ; nor are the mysteries of the word to be expounded to the profane.\" (Stro- mata, Booh V, Ch. IX.) In the next chapter he says distinctly that \"there is an instruction of the perfect. . . to whom God wished to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations. So that on the one hand, then, are the mysteries which were hid till the time of the apostles, and were delivered by them as they received from the Lord and concealed in the Old Testament, were manifested to the saints. And, on the other hand, there is 'the riches of the glory of the mystery in the Gentiles,' which is faith and hope in Christ; which in another place he has called the 'foundation.' \" He says that the \"knowledge does not appertain to all\" and quotes Paul to this effect (Col. 11, 2, 3). \"Blessed be our Lord, Brethren,\" he says, \"who has put into our hearts wisdom and the under- standing of His secrets. . . . It is but for few to comprehend these things. . . Instruction, which reveals hidden things, is called illumination, as it is the teacher only who uncovers the lid of the ark. . .

But only to a few of them is shown what those things are which are contained in the mystery. Rightly, then, Plato, in the epistles, treating of God, says, 'We must speak in enigmas; that should the tablet come, by any mis- chance on its leaves, either by sea or land, he who reads may remain ignorant.' . . Akin to this is what the holy apostle Paul says, preserving the pro- phetic and truly ancient secret from which the teach- ings that were good were derived by the Greeks, 'Howbeit we speak wisdom among them who are per- fect.' \" (Stromata, Book V, Ch. X.) \"Wisdom,\" he declares, \"to be certain knowledge, being a sure and irrefragable apprehension of things divine and human, comprehending the present, past, and future. . . and it is irrefragable by reason, inasmuch as it has been communicated. . . And the gnosis itself is that which has descended by trans- mission to a few, having been imparted unwritten by the apostles.\" (Stromata, Book VI, Ch. VII.) These quotations might easily be extended, but a sufficient number has been given to show that Clement knew of a secret teaching and was writing for the benefit of those who, like himself, were Initiates in the Christian Mysteries. Clement quotes continually from the Scriptures to illustrate the mystic teaching,"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"102 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry thus showing that he recognized the passages to which we referred earlier as evidencing the existence of a hidden, esoteric, teaching. The Gnostic 'was one who knew, an Initiate of the Mysteries. Let us now turn to Origen, the noted pupil of Cle- ment, and beyond doubt the greatest scholar in the early church. In his famous controversy with Celsus many references were made to the secret teachings of the church. Celsus charges Christianity with being a secret system. Origen replying, that while certain things were secret, others were public, says, \"But that there should be certain doctrines, not made known to the multitude, which are (revealed) after the exoteric ones have been taught, is not a peculiarity ot Chris- tianity alone, but also of philosophic systems, in which certain truths are exoteric and others esoteric. Some of the hearers of Pythagoras were content with his ipse dixit; while others were taught in secret those doctrines which were not deemed fit to be com- municated to profane and insufficiently prepared ears. Moreover, all the Mysteries that are celebrated every- where throughout Greece and barbarous countries, al- though held in secret, have no discredit thrown upon them, so that it is in vain that he endeavors to calum- niate the secret doctrine of Christianity, seeing he does not correctly understand its nature.\" (Origen Against Celsus, Book I, Ch. VII.} Again Origen says, \"I have not yet spoken of the observance of all that is written in the Gospels, each one of which contains much doctrine difficult to be understood, not merely by the multitude, but even by certain of the more intelligent, including a very pro- found explanation of the parables which Jesus deliv-"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Christian Mysteries 103 ered to 'those without,' while reserving the exhibition of their full meaning for those who had passed be- yond the stage of exoteric teaching, and who came to Him privately in the house. . . what we have said is sufficient by way of answer to the unphilosophic sneers of Celsus, in comparing the inner mysteries of the church of God to the cats and apes, and croco- diles, and goats, and dogs of Egypt.\" (Origen Against Celsus, Book III, Ch. XXL} A little further on in the same Book he again says, \"And if you come to the books written after the time of Jesus, you will find that those multitudes of be- lievers who hear the parables are, as it were, 'without' and worthy only of exoteric doctrines, while the dis- ciples learn in private the explanation of the parables.\" (Origen Against Celsus, Book III, Ch. LVI.) Celsus criticised the Christians for inviting sinners into the Church. He says that in other Mysteries he only is invited who has \"clean hands and a pru- dent tongue; he only who is pure from all pollution and whose soul is conscious of no evil and who has lived well and justly.\" Origen replies that, \"It is not the same to invite those who are sick in soul .to be cured, and those who are in health to the knowledge and study of divine things. We, however, keeping both these things in view, at first invite all men to be healed, and exhort those who are sinners to come to the consideration of the doctrines which teach men not to sin, and those who are devoid of understanding to those which beget wisdom, and those who are chil- dren to rise in their thoughts to manhood, and those who are simply unfortunate to good fortune, or which is the more appropriate term to use to blessed-"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"104 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry ness. And when those who have been turned toward virtue have made progress, and have shown that they have been purified by the word, and have led as far as they can a better life, then and not before do we invite them to participation in our mysteries. 'For we speak wisdom among them that are perfect.' \" (Origen Against Celsus, Book III, Ch. LIX.) Origen then explains that in the Christian Mys- teries as in all others those are received who have \"clean hands,\" who are \"athletes in piety and every virtue.\" \"Whoever is pure not only from all defile- ment,\" he says, \"but from what are regarded as lesser transgressions, let him be boldly initiated in the mys- teries of Jesus, which properly are made known only to the holy and the pure. . . He who acts as an initiator, according to the precepts of Jesus, will say to those who have been purified in heart, 'He whose soul has, for a long time, been conscious of no evil, and especially since he yielded himself to the healing of the word, let such a one hear the. doctrines which were spoken in private by Jesus to His genuine dis- ciples.' Therefore in the comparison which he insti- tutes between the procedure of the initiators into the Grecian mysteries, and the teachers of the doctrine of Jesus, he does not know the difference between in- viting the wicked to be healed, and initiating those al- ready purified into the sacred mysteries ! Not to par- ticipation in mysteries, then, and to fellowship in the wisdom hidden in a mystery, which God ordained before the world to the glory of His saints, do we invite the wicked man, and the thief. . . but such as these we in- vite to be healed. . .

God the Word was sent, indeed, as a physician to sinners, and also as a teacher of divine mysteries to those who are already pure and who sin no more.\" (Origen Against Celsus, Book III, Ch. LX, LXI, LXII.) Archilaus, Bishop of Cesarea in Mesopotamia, says, \"The Lord spake in parables to those who were in- capable of hearing, but to His disciples He explained these parables in private. For the illumination of the glory is for those who have been enlightened, while the blinding is for them who believe not. These mys- teries, which the church now declares to you who are transferred from the lists of the catechumens, it is not her custom' to declare to the Gentiles. For we do not declare the mysteries touching the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit to a Gentile ; neither do we speak of the mysteries plainly in presence of the cate- chumens ; but many a time we express ourselves in an occult manner, so that the faithful who have intelli- gence may apprehend the truths referred to, while those who have not that intelligence may receive no hurt.\" (Anti Nicene Fathers, Vol. VI, p. 235.) Quotations of this import could be extended, if necessary, but it is now beyond question that there existed in the early church a definite institution called the \"Sacred Mysteries\" or the \"Mysteries of Jesus,\" wherein was taught a higher wisdom.

Whereas in the early days of the church the attainment of purity was not the goal, but merely the beginning. There were three stages or degrees through which men passed Purification, Il- lumination, and Perfection. Purification led to saint- ship ; Illumination gave interior knowledge, the Gnosis taught in the Mysteries; Perfection was the attainment of unity with the Divine. The early church went on from the point where the modern church leaves off, and taking the saint led him to the Beatific Vision. During these early centuries there was a struggle between the two elements in Christianity the few who possessed the inner teaching, and the mass of common believers. The exoteric element finally gained supremacy, and the Mystics were denounced as heretics. The Mysteries, as an organized institu- tion, ceased temporarily for lack of suitable material. The Sublime Secret, however, was not lost, for the light continued to burn through all the ages. From time to time efforts were made to revive the institution to its former glory, but the conditions of the age were too gross and superstitious. \"Two streams may nevertheless be tracked through Christen- dom, streams which had as their source the vanished Mysteries. One was the stream of mystic learning, flowing from the Wisdom, the Gnosis, imparted in the Mysteries [both Pagan and Christian] ; the other was the stream of mystic contemplation, equally part of the Gnosis, leading to the ecstasy, to spiritual vision.

Thus the Secret Teaching has been passed along down the ages. Scholars, Saints and Martyrs have everywhere sought the hidden truth, and the various occult brotherhoods, mystical associations, and many so-called heretical sects, have been links in the chain of that Wisdom Religion, which is the source of all religious schools and philosophies. The great Spirit- ual Hierarchy, the guardian of the mystic tradition (which constitutes the science of the soul), has always been and always will be as ready to give, as man in his evolutionary condition is ready to receive, instruc- tion in Divine Wisdom. With the growth of the race old forms perished, and those who identified the spirit with the form thought all was destroyed. But as the form perished the conscious life sought new embodiment, and thus have the guardians of truth passed along the higher knowledge to those who were ready to receive it. Who then can doubt a definite design in the preservation of the Divine Truth through all the ages?

THE MEANING OF TRUE INITIATION. It is a well known fact that the biographies of all the great World-Saviors closely resemble each other. All are represented as divinely begotten, and born at the same time of the year; all are threatened with death in infancy; all are tempted, persecuted, and finally slain ; all descend into hell and after three days rise from the dead ; and at last all ascend into heaven and become glorified Gods. What is the explanation of this wonderful simi- larity in the lives of Jesus, Apollonius, Mithra, Bud- dha, Krishna, Zoroaster, etc.? The solution of this remarkable identity is to be found in the fact that all these Saviors were Initiates into the Mysteries of An- tiquity. The various narratives do not describe the physcal life of the heroes, but the inner mystic life, being but a materialization of the mystic life of the Initiate. The physical plane biographies might great- ly vary, but their lives as Initiates are ever the same. In our study of the meaning of true Initiation we shall see the origin of these stories. I will commence at the beginning and trace the various stages of progress. In the first place, a man to be recognized as a candidate, must be pure and holy, and possess a well- developed and well-trained mind. Having attained"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"110 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry the exoteric \"good life,\" he enters on the prepara- tion for Initiation. Certain conditions have now to be fulfilled and certain attributes acquired. The as- pirant for Initiation must be \"worthy and well quali- fied, duly and truly prepared.\" During this period the candidate is said to be treading the Probationary Path, the Path which leads up to the \"Strait Gate,\" beyond which is the \"Narrow Way,\" or the \"Path of Holiness,\" the \"Way of the Cross,\" which leadeth unto life. Let me briefly sum up the attributes to be ac- quired : 1. Discrimination. This means that the aspirant becomes able to distinguish between the Eternal and the Temporal, the Real and the Unreal, so that what is unreal to. the world becomes real to him. He must set his affections on things above, loosen the ties on worldly objects, and fix his aspirations on things per- taining to the unseen. This has been called \"al- legiance to the Higher Self.\" 2. Devotion to Right. The aspirant here learns to do what is right because it is right, without regard to his own gain or loss. This is sometimes called in- difference to personal reward as the fruit of good actions. This indifference is the natural result of the previous step, men cease to crave for earthly re- wards when they realize their\" impermanent char- acter. 3.

(c) Tolerance freedom from bigotry, from an exaggerated attachment to any doc- trinal belief, leading to a wide impartiality, (d) For- bearance freedom from resentment in respect to real or fancied wrongs, (e) Steadfastness incapa- bility of being turned aside from one's purpose, (f) Faith confidence in the power of the Master to teach the truth, and of one's self to grasp and wield it. 4. Direct Order or Succession a clearly defined desire for spiritual existence, and union with the higher ideals. 5. Readiness for Initiation the result of the pre- vious acquirements. The candidate is not expected to fully develop these attributes, he must, however, have made progress in them before he is ready for the first step on the Path Proper. When the time comes that he is regarded fit for Initiation, he is conducted by the Master, who has been watching over his earlier progress, to the thresh- old where the \"Guardians of the Mysteries\" open for him the \"Strait Gate.\" The Path Proper is divided into four stages, or five stages with the culmination. In the first four stages the period between the good man and the triumphant Master the neophyte is to cast off the ten fetters that bind him to the circle of rebirth, and which keep him from realizing Nirvana the highest state of spiritual consciousness. No partial success will here suffice, he must be entirely free before he can pass from one stage to the next. When these fetters are cast off the ego is ready for the fifth stage full adeptship.

One who attains this level is called the Sotapanna or Sowani he who has entered the stream, one who has begun the higher human evolution. This evolution is that of the Divine Child, and is called in different sys- tems by different names Christ, Horus, Buddha, etc. It was at this first great Initiation that the Divine Child was born in man. This was spoken of as the \"New\" or ''Second Birth\" a mystic term often em- ployed to denote the rites of Initiation. In India, even to-day, the higher castes are called the \"twice born/' and the ceremony that -makes them such is called Initiation. The rite of baptism is connected with the first Initiation. It is a symbol of purifica- tion, and signifies that the candidate has attained the purity of character necessary for acceptance. \"In all these Mysteries,\" says Dr. Mackey, \"the first step taken by the candidate was a lustration or purification. The aspirant was not permitted to enter the sacred vestibule, or take any part in the secret formula of Initiation, until, by water or by fire, he was emblematically purified from the cor- ruptions of the world which he was about to leave behind.\" (Symbolism of Freemasonry, Mackey, p. 93.) The purification of the body was symbolic of a purification of the heart. Frederic Portal, in speaking of the Egyptian Mys- teries, says, \"In Egyptian Cosmogony. . . water was the mother of the world, the matrix of all created be- ings. Man was considered as an image of the world, the Initiate was to be born again to a new life and the baptism thenceforward symbolized the primeval"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Meaning of True Initiation 113 waters; it was on this account that the Initiate was called \"Moses,\" a word signifying in Egyptian, accord- ing to Josephus, saved from the water, or by the water. . . water was a symbol of purity and desig- nated the birth of the pure or Initiated.\" (A Compari- son of Egyptian Symbols with those of the Hebrews, p. 81.) Again, he says, speaking of the method of Egyptian baptism, \"Horus and Thoth-Lunus pour water on the head of the candidate, who is trans- formed to divine life and to purity.\" The le- gend accompanying this scene he translates thus, \"Horus, son of Isis, baptises with water and fire.\" This is repeated three times. The name given to the baptized or anointed, as we have seen, was Moses, signifying regenerated, or be- gotten again. Remember the lawgiver of the Jews was called by the Egyptians Moses one saved by water, or, in other words, one Initiated. In the Acts of the Apostles we are told that Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; if so, he must have been an Initiate. The great Mystery of Egypt was this second birth, the Birth of Horus. Says W. Marsham Adams, \"Throughout the sacred writings of Egypt, there is no doctrine of which more frequent mention is made than that of a divine birth.\" (The Egyptian Doctrine of Light, Adams, p. 89.) The candidate was initiated from the Sacred Roll, called the \"Book of the Greatest Mysteries,\" and after passing the Passage of the Sun, the crown of Illumination was placed upon his head.

Hermes in the \"Secret Sermon on the Mountain,\" discourses on the secret of the New Birth. This might well be called the \"Initiation of Tat.\" The sermon is in the form of a dialogue between Hermes the Master and Tat the pupil. Tat says, \"In the General Sermons, father [a technical name of the Master or Initiator], thou didst speak in riddles most unclear, conversing on Divinity ; and when thou saidst no man could e'er be saved before Rebirth, thy mean- ing thou didst hide. Further, when I became thy Suppliant, in Wending up the Mount, after thou hadst conversed with me, and when I longed to learn the Sermon (Logos) on Rebirth, (for this beyond all other things is just the thing I know not), thou saidst, that thou wouldst give it me 'when thou shalt have become a stranger to the world.' Wherefore I got me ready and made the thought in me a stranger to the world-illusion.\" G. R. S. Mead, in his \"Thrice Greatest Hermes,\" in commenting upon this discourse, says, \"The time has come for Tat to receive, through his Master, the touch of the true Mind in Consciousness, the Christ is to be born in his heart, the light of the Pleroma is to shine in his inmost being. It is to be a New Birth, a Regeneration, or Rebirth, in the sense of being born from Above.\" (Thrice Greatest Hermes, Mead, Vol. U. P- 2390"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Meaning of True Initiation H5 Tat had made himself ready for this Rebirth by passing through three stages of probation. He had been prepared by \"Wending up the Mount.\" The phrase \"On the Mountain\" or \"Wending up the Moun- tain\" is symbolical of the grades of Initiation. The term is of frequent occurence in the Christian Gno- stic and Apochryphal writings, and everywhere sig- nifies the \"Mount of Initiation.\" In the popular be- liefs, the mountain is called the \"Mount of Galilee,\" on which all the rites of Initiation were performed. But the real \"Mount\" was no physical elevation, it was the \"height of contemplation, an inner state of spiritual consciousness.\" Tat had been wending his way up this \"Mount\" and was now ready for the New Birth, \"The crowning mystery of the Spiritual Way for all the mystic schools of the time.\" \"The secret that Tat would learn is the Mystery of the birth from the Virgin Womb the Birth of Man, the Great Mystery of Regeneration.\" (Ibid, p. 240.) Tat entreats Hermes to explain to him the manner of this Rebirth. But Hermes, cannot tell to Tat the secret in words. It must be self-perceived. \"This race my child,\" says Hermes, \"was never taught.\" This is the \"Race\" referred to by Philo as the \"Race of Devotees who are ever taught more and more to see, let them strive for the Initiation of That-which-is ; let them transcend the sun which men perceive [and gaze upon the Light beyond, the True Sun or Logos,] nor ever leave this rank which leads to Perfect Bless- edness.

This \"Race,\" then, was the Race of Initiates, the \"Race of Elxai\" mentioned by Epiphanius. Those* attaining this state apprehend- ed the mystery of Rebirth. Although this spiritual state could not be taught to the neophyte in words, still, as Mead puts it, Hermes can guide Tat toward the realization of the Blessed Sight, by putting himself into the sublime state of consciousness, that Tat, so to speak, bathes, or is baptized in his Master's spiritual presence the Cup of the Mind. This is the true laying on of hands. Hermes describes the change that takes place in him- self when he passes into the high spiritual conscious- r ness. \"Whene'er I see within myself the Simple Vis- ion. . . I have passed through myself into a Body that can never die. And now I am not what I was before; but I am born in Mind.\" The Master focus- ses his consciousness in the higher part of his spirit- ual nature transfers it to a spiritual vehicle. \"The way to do this is not taught, and it cannot be seen by the compound element by means of which thou seest,\" that is, it cannot be understood from any sen- sible experience. No physical sight can penetrate this Mystery. \"Thou seest me with eyes, my son,\" says Hermes, \"but what I am thou dost not under- stand.\" The outer physical form of the Master was there, but his soul had been liberated from the body."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Meaning of True Initiation 117 This mystery could only be understood by one who himself had reached the higher state. Tat's spiritual senses are being born by the aid of the Master. He says, \"Into fierce frenzy and mind fury hast thou plunged me, father, for now no longer do I see myself.\" He is losing touch with the physi- cal plane consciousness, but that is not enough. Hermes says, \"I would, my son, that thou had'st e'en passed right through thyself,\" that is, passed into the higher vehicle, \"the body that can never die.\" This is the mystery that Hermes could not explain in words. (The Secret Sermon on the Mountain.) Isis is not permitted to declare the secret of Re- birth openly to Horus. She says, \"I may not tell the story of this birth; for it is not permitted to declare the origin of thy descent, O Horus, son of mighty power, lest afterward the Way-of-Birth of the immor- tal Gods should be known unto men.\" (Quoted in Thrice Greatest Hermes, Vol. II, p. 242.) In the Isis mystery tradition we find that it was a part of the worl: to bestow this higher consciousness. Diod- orus informs us that it was Isis who \"discovered the Philtre of immortality, by means of which, when her son Horus, who had been plotted against by the Titans, and found dead beneath the waters, not only raised him to life, but also made him a sharer in immortality.\" Initiation bestowed or restored to the soul the consciousness of immortality. This was truly a new birth, an inner change, a \"striking of a new keynote.\" He who is reborn into the Gno- sis, passes from man into the state of super-man.

This is true illumination. Those who attained this Hermes or Horus state were to keep silent concerning their powers, and not boast of their Gnosis. We find this same teaching in the Christian Mys- teries. Jesus says, \"Except a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God.\" (John, in, 3.) Peter says, \"Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth. . . being born again not of cor- ruptible seed but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever.\" (/. Peter L 22-23.) The birth is spoken of as that of \"water and the spirit.\" In the Mysteries of Jesus, as in all others, baptism was always connected with the first Initiatory Rite. Many illustrations of this pivot doctrine of the early church might be cited from Gnostic writings. The over-writer of the Naassene Document tells us that the Lesser Mysteries pertain to fleshly genera- tion, whereas the Greater, deal with the new or sec- ond birth, with regeneration and not with genesis. In speaking of the Mystery of Regeneration, the writer says, \"For this is the Gate of Heaven, and this is the House of God, where the Good God dwells alone; into which [house] no impure [man] shall come no psychic, no fleshly [man] but it is kept under watch for the spiritual alone where, when they come, they must cast away their garments, and all become bridegrooms, obtaining their true man- hood through the Virginal Spirit.

In the mystery ritual of Initiation in the \"Acts of John,\" we read, \"Who I am, thou shalt know when I depart [that is, by contrast]. What I am seen to be, that am I not ; but what I am, thou shalt see when thou comest.\" In other words, this spiritual state must be realized to be known, and only those who had attained the Christ state the Perfect Initiate could know it. Remember the words of Hermes al- ready cited, \"Thou seest me with eyes, my son; but what I am thou dost not understand.\" This con- sciousness transcends man's normal state. Although the new birth primarily signfied the first great Initiation, when the white robed neophyte en- tered the \"Communion of Saints,\" still, the mystic term might .well indicate the other stages of soul de- velopment, for it signalized the entrance to a new life. The Initiate is ushered into a new state of con- sciousness at each stage, as much so as the new born infant when ushered into physical existence.

Each rite was a sign and symbol of spiritual con- sciousness which had come to the new born disciple. \"The Christ principle, the intuitional Wisdom, is born in the soul, and when that Buddhic [spiritual] consciousness is awakened, the soul becomes again, as it were, a little child, born into that higher life of the Initiated, which is in truth the Kingdom of Heaven.\" (Christian Creed, Leadbeater, p. 76.) The new born Son, the \"little child,\" a technical term de- noting one just Initiated, is now to live the divine life and become \"like unto the Father\" pass from Sonship to Perfection. The new or spiritual birth, then, is a mystic fact. The materialization of this inner truth into the dogma of the \"Virgin Birth\" must have been a comparatively late development in the evolution of popular or gen- eral Christianity. The dogma is not to be found in the common document, and the earlier traditions all state that Joseph was the natural father of Jesus. Celsus accused the Christians of changing their gospel story many times in order to better answer the ob- jections of opponents. This is true only of the ex- oteric tradition. Now let us consider the various stages in the evo- lution of the Christ in man. To understand this higher evolution, which constituted the work of the True Mysteries, we must understand man's constitu- tion. We will use 1 here the Christian terminology because of familiarity with the terms, but the facts described are the same in all systems."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Meaning of True Initiation 121 Christian theology usually accepts the three-fold division Spirit, Soul and Body. This is sound, but in order to understand the Mystery of the life of the Divine Child, especially his crucifixion, resurrection and ascension, we shall need a further subdivision of man's constitution. The spirit is itself a trinity, containing the three aspects of the divine life In- telligence, Love and Will; the soul is twofold, com- posed of the mind and emotional nature; the body is the material instrument of the soul and spirit, and is also dual, being composed of the dense physical body and its etheric double. These lower portions or prin- ciples the dual physical body, the desire or emo- tional body, and the mental body form the natural body spoken of by of St. Paul. The Aipostle says, \"There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.\" The spiritual is made up of the three higher principles. The lowest of these is sometimes called the Causal body, the second division the Bliss or Glorified or resurrected body, the third and highest division, the Atmic body. These principles or bodies are correlated with the lower five of the seven planes of our universe. The normal evolution of mankind takes place on the three lowest planes; the Super-normal evolution, that of the Initiate, proceeds on the next two planes which are the spiritual. These five planes constitute the field of the evolution of consciousness until the \"hu- man merges into the divine.\" Bearing these divisions of man's constitution in mind and the planes to which they are correlated, we are ready to study the mystery of the Christ evolu- tion. This evolution is set forth in the story of the"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"122 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Mystic Christ. The Mystic Christ is one aspect of the Christ of the Mysteries. The Mystic Christ deals with this Christ evolution, which is the development of the Love, or second aspect, of the unfolding divine spirit in man, called the Christ; the other aspect, called the Mythic Christ, is the Logos, the second Aspect or Person of the Trinity, descending into matter. The development of the first division of the spirit- ual body, the aspect of intelligence, takes place in the ordinary life of the world. When this intellectual development has been carried to a high point, ac- companied by moral development, then the man is ready for the evolution of the second aspect of the spirit, the second division of the spiritual body, that of Love, called the Christ. We will consider first this aspect of the Mystic Christ the evolution of the Christ of the human spirit. This is the \"Christ who is in every one of us, who is born and lives, is crucified, rises from the dead, and ascends into heaven in every suffering and triumphant Son of Man.\" This is the story of the mystic life of every Initiate. We have seen that at the first great Initiation the Christ is born in the disciple. This is the second birth to which we have referred. He is born into the Kingdom of Heaven as a little child the name given to a new Initiate. Jesus said that except a man becomes as a little child he cannot enter the Kingdom.

He grows in wisdom and spiritual stature until the time comes for the second great Initiation, symbolized by the baptism \"by water and the spirit,\" which confers on him the powers necessary for the Teacher. He then goes forth into the world to labor, and is led by the Spirit into the wildnerness, and is there exposed to severe temptations. The evil powers strive to lure him from his set purpose, bidding him use his unfolding powers to secure worldly ends. But tri- umphant over those temptations, he uses the powers which he would not employ for his own needs, to save the world. This devotion to service leads him to the third great Initiation, symbolized by the Transfigura- tion. He again ascends \"the mountain apart,\" the sacred mount of initiation, but he cannot there remain. He sets his face resolutely toward Jerusalem, where he is to meet the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of Fire the final test and the last stage of the \"Way of the Cross.\" He is now ready for the fourth great In- itiation, symbolized by the passion. He has become vic- torious over the lower nature, and is willing to nail it to the cross.

This story of the gospel biography sets forth in allegory the life history of every Initiate. The in- itiatory rites symbolize the stages through which the candidate passes. The stage of the soul's progress typified by death, burial and resurrection, was called in Egypt \"the death rite,\" and by the Gnostic Chris- tians \"the Initiation of the Cross.\" The candidate was received by the initiating Hiero- phant at the proper time and place, usually a secluded chamber in a temple or pyramid, and laid on the stone floor with arms outstretched; sometimes on a wooden cross, which was hollowed out to support the human figure. He was then touched with the thyr- sus, the \"spear of the crucifixion,\" on the heart; he then passed into a deep trance. The body was placed in a sarcophagus of stone, a vault or tomb beneath the floor of the Hall of Initiation; and carefully guarded. Meantime, while the body was dead and buried, he himself was fully alive in the invisible world (Hades), and undergoing what was called the tests of earth, water, fire and air. He then put on his perfected Bliss Body, which was now fully or- ganized as a vehicle of consciousness. After the third day the cross, bearing the body, was lifted up and carried out into the air on the east side of the pyramid or temple and placed on a sloping surface ready to greet the rising sun. At the moment the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Meaning of True Initiation 125 first rays touched the face, the perfected Initiate, the Horus or Christ, rose from the dead, resuscitated the body, and glorified it by his resurrected body, no longer a natural man but a spiritual man, having over- come death and hell. The trance typifies his \"death unto sin\"; the re- vival, his \"rebirth or resurrection unto righteousness.\" In the \"Acts of John\" there is preserved the tradition of the inner schools on the mystery of the \"In- itiation of the Cross.\" We find here no trace of the literal historic tradition. The crucifixion was an in- ner experience of the soul. The cross was a symbol of the crucifixion of the soul in the matter and its regeneraton. \"Mystical death,\" says Dr. Hartman, \"is identical with spirital regeneration.\" (\"Magic White and Black,\" Hartman, p. 185.) The cross also sym- bolizes cosmic processes. If the \"Acts of John\" had given the drama of Initiation, as well as the liturgy, we should undoubtedly have seen that the passion of Christ was something quite different from what has been popularly supposed. I have shown in the pieceding lectures that the symbolic rites of \"crucifixion\" and the \"resurrection of the dead,\" were connected with the most world-wide mystic festivals of antiquity, a highly important fact, for it enables us to understand the meaning of the Christian crucifixion and resur- rection. When the neophyte reached a certain stage of perfection or enlightenment, he was said to \"rise from the dead.\" The phrase \"resurrection from the dead\" is a mystical phrase used to represent the new birth or resurrection, the Gnostic illumination.

I, 18.) Let me here cite several authorities regarding this important ceremony: Dr. Oliver, speaking of In- itiation, says, \"It was considered to be a mystical death or oblivion of all the stains and imperfections of a corrupted and evil life, as well as a descent into hell, where every pollution was purged by lustrations of fire and water; and the perfect Epopt was then said to be regenerated or new born, restored to a renovated existence of life, light and purity, and placed under divine protection.\" (History of In- itiation, Oliver, p. n.) In his \"Signs and Symbols,\" he again says, \"In all the Ancient Mysteries, before an aspirant could claim to participate in the higher secrets of the institution, he was placed within the Pastos, or Bed, or Coffin; or, in other words, was sub- jected to a solitary confinement for a prescribed period of time, that he might reflect seriously, in seclusion and darkness, on what he was about to undertake. . . . This was the symboical death of the mysteries, and his deliverance from confinement was the act of regeneration or being born again; or, as it was also termed, being raised from the dead. . . The cere- mony here alluded to was, doubtless, the same as the descent into Hades. . .

Dr. Mackey says, \"The vault was, in the Ancient Mysteries, symbolic of the grave, for Initiation was symbolic of death, where alone divine Truth is to be found.\" (Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Mackey, p. 852.) He again says, \"The intention of the cere- monies of Initiation into them, was, by a scenic representation of death, and subsequent restoration to life, to impress the great truths of the resurrection of the dead and the immortality of the soul. . .They were all funereal in their character; they began in sorrow and lamentation, they ended in joy; there was an aphanism, or burial ; a pastos, or grave ; an eure- sis, or discovery of what had been lost ; and a legend, or mythical relation all of which were entirely and profoundly symbolical in their character.\" (The Sym- bolism of Freemasonry, Mackey, p. 38). Faber says, \"The Initiation into the Mysteries scenically represented the mystic descent into Hades and the return from thence to the light of day.\" (\"Origin of Pagan Idolatry,\" Fabcr, Vol. IV., p. 384). Many other authorities might be cited in evidence of this ceremony, but this will suffice to prove the ceremony universal and connected with all the Mys- tery Institutions.

It has been suggested that the shortening of the time was due to the fact that in the degeneracy of the Mysteries, where attempts were made to minimize all require- ments, the original period became so tedious to candi- dates who could not pass into the trance, that the time was reduced from seventy-two hours to twenty- seven, by just reversing the figures, thus saving the candidate nearly two full days of solitary confine- ment. The materialized gospel story, evidently fol- lowed this later practice. These great rites stood originally for great spirit- ual truths. The body with which the candidate \"rose from the dead\" was the Bliss Body the body of the Christ which had been developed during the period of service on earth. This body belongs to the life of the Initiate the Christ life. Its building begins at the second birth, when the Christ is born in man, and reaches its completion at the resurrection. Dur- ing this evolutionary period, when the Son is \"be- ing made perfect\" the Initiate is called the \"Son of Man;\" the perfected, risen, and glorified Christ is called the \"Son of God.\" There is still another feature of the Christ story the Ascension. This has to do with the third part of the spiritual body, the putting on of the Atmic body, or the Vesture or Robe of Glory, as it is called in the Pistis Sophia.

In the preceding lecture we have studied the Mys- tic Christ ; now we are to consider the Mythic Christ.

It begins with his birth at the winter solstice, after the shortest day of the year, in the early morning hours of Dec. 25th, as the sign Virgo is rising above the horizon. He is thus born of a Virgin who remains such after giving birth to her Sun-Child, for the celes- tial Virgo is still unchanged. In the ancient drawings Virgo of the Zodiac is represented as a woman suck- ling a child ; here we find the origin of the symbol of the Madonna. The Sun-God is weak and feeble in his infancy born at the period when the days are shortest and the nights longest, as with us on this side of the equa- torial line. He is beset by perils in his early youth, but he outlives the threatening dangers of darkness and storm, and grows to manhood. However, he is rapidly approaching his crucifixion, and the glorious days preceding the spring equinox are soon to be clouded by the solar disturbances incident upon his crossing the line. This crossing was called the cruci- fixion, the date varying with each year. But like all so-called death it is an illusion merely a transition to a higher life. The Sun-God soon rises triumph- antly and ascends into heaven the storms are dissi- pated and darkness gives way to all-conquering light. Jupiter, Osiris, Ormuzd, Apollo, are victorious over all their foes. All nature rejoices, celebrating their conquest, and order is re-established in place of the dire confusion that reigned while gloomy Typhon or Ahriman was dominant.

There he rules triumphant and gives his very lite to ripen the fruit and grain and so sustain his worshipers. These are the salient points in the lives of all the Sun-Gods, for each is born on the 25th of December, and crucified at the Vernal equinox. The birth-date is fixed, while the death-date is variable. This of it- self should be sufficient to show us that both Christ- mas and Easter (the Sunday following the next full moon after the vernal equinox) were originally solar festivals. A festival calculated by the relative posi- tions of sun and moon, was not designed to commem- orate the anniversary of any historical event. We are not here dealing with the history of a man, but with the Hero of a solar myth. It is interesting to note that the fast preceding the Easter festival is world-wide, and in many countries extended to the time limit of our modern Lent forty days. Of course, the original period was only the time intervening between the death and resurrec- tion. Another interesting fact in this connection is that the animal adopted as the symbol of the Hero is the sign of the Zodiac in which the Sun is at the vernal equinox of his age, and this varies with the pre- cession of the equinoxes. Thus Cannes and Jesus had the sign Pisces the Fishes; Mithra and Osiris Taurus the Bull ; Jupiter- Ammon- Aries the Lamb, etc., while Jesus is also represented as the Lamb. The Sun-Myth, then, primarily sets forth the ac- tivity of the Logos in the Cosmos. This activity is"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Meaning of True Initiation 133 reflected in a partial way in the yearly course of the Sun. The Logos, in His Second Aspect, as the Cos- mic-Mythic Christ, descends into matter becomes incarnate, clothed in \"flesh.\" He thus sacrifices him- self by putting on the limitations of matter, entering the womb of matter which is yet virgin, unproduc- tive. This matter has been vivified by the Holy Spirit that it might presently take form and is thus prepared to receive the life of the Second Logos, the Son aspect of God, who took this matter as a vehicle for his energies. The original of the Nicene Creed ran thus, \"And was incarnate of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary\" not of the virgin-matter alone, but of matter already pulsating with the life of the Third Logos, so that both the life and the matter surrounded Him as a vesture. Thus was the descent of the Logos into matter de- scribed, in the historicized life of the Saviors, as the \"Virgin Birth,\" and in the Solar Myth as the birth of the Sun-God. The misapprehension of this allegorical illustration, as the life history of a physical human being, and its identification with Jesus, and the various other World- Saviors, was most unfor- tunate and misleading. After the incarntaion \"come the early workings of the Logos in matter, aptly typified by the infancy of the Myth.

Truly are we clothed in Him, first materially and then spiritually.\" (Esoteric Christianity, p. 181.) The Logos thus leaves the plane of Infinitude, where He is one with the Father, and becomes incar- nate, and is finally crucified in space. This is the crucifixion of Christ, the great cosmic sacrifice, rep- resented by the symbol of the crucified Man, which at last becomes materialized into an actual death by crucifixon. The story thus historicized became at- tached to the various World-Saviors. But the orig- inal crucifixion was 90 disgrace, for the symbol used to represent this mystery is that of the Heavenly Man, with arms outstretched, pouring life and light into His creatures. The Solar-Myth outlines these great spiritual facts regarding the working of God in the universe. Every symbol has both a primary and a secondary meaning.

All who are thus signified would have cer- tain characteristics in common and pass through cer- tain activities, and thus of necessity there would arise similarities in the lives of these ambassadors their life history as Initiates being outlined by the course of the Sun. When one becomes an Initiate, or when an Initiate is sent out into the world as a Teacher of men, and especially when a spirit such as Jesus becomes a Hier- ophant in the Mysteries, then the legends of the Mythic Christ, which have been told of other Great Ones, surround Him and He becomes clothed in the drapery of the Solar-Myth. This is perfectly natu- ral and proper, for the Solar-Myth typifies the vari- ous stages of progress through whch He has passed, and this symbolism could only be applied to one who had attained- the Christ stage of evolution. With such a one the festival of his nativity became the date when the Son was born in the Virgin, and the sign of the zodiac at the vernal equinox became that of his crucifixion. Although these dates were purely arbitrary, adopted from the Sun-Myth, the facts sym- bolized by the birth, death, and resurrection were living realities in the Mystic life of every Son of God. The adoption of these dates into the materialized life- story of the Great Saviors is thus readily explained they were derived from the solar symbolism. The fact that the rites of Initiation and the Solar-Myth both symbolize the same thing, the former primarily typifying the growth of the soul, secondarily the work of the Logos, and vice versa, made the inter-weaving of the symbolism in this particular perfectly natural, especially so as the great solar festivals, the solstices"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"136 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry and equinoxes, were the times when the Mysteries were celebrated and the rites of Initiation adminis- tered. Thus both the Mythic and Mystic Christ have contributed to the gospel story. These Sun-Myth stories have recurred through all the ages, having been told and retold in turn of each great Teacher, the legends of the Mythic Christ, Buddha, Krishna, mingling with the history of each, and crystallizing about each as an historical person- age. But these materialized stories pertain especially to the life of the Son of Man, a distinctive title, not of an individual but an office. When one attains this level and stands in this relation to humanity, then, as a representative of God, the story of the Logos in the Sun becomes his own indeed, for the facts under- lying this story have been wholly realized in his spir- itual life. Here we learn the manner in which arose the story of the death, burial and resurrection of a crucified Savior. On the lines of the Solar-Myth and the Initiatory rites, the materializing tendency of man wrought out for itself, in each religion, an historical narrative of a personal Savior, who is virgin born, is crucified, rises from the dead, and finally ascends into heaven ; or, the historicizing, may, in some in- stances, have been purposely done by those who knew, the popular narrative being written for the multitude in such a way as to set forth the Mys- teries allegorically. In either case, and perhaps both methods played a part (we have abundant proof of the former and many indications of the latter), the account symbolizes the inner doctrine and sets forth figuratively the occult teaching of the Gnosis. But"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Meaning of True Initiation 137 the real meaning of the symbolical teaching of the Myth and Ritual has been practically lost sight of; most people to-day regard the narratives as the physical life history of individuals. However, there are some who are beginning to understand that the symbolical teaching of the death, burial, and resur- rection are but typical of the soul's progress. Jesus of Nazareth, like Buddha, Krishna, and many others, was draped with the stories of the Logos, and the salient events in the Sun-Myth become the salient events in his physical life. The symbols, once ma- terialized, were attached to each Divine Teacher in turn, giving rise to the wonderful similarities in their respective biographies. But let us not lose sight of the fact that the mystic birth, baptism, transfiguration, death, resurrection and ascension were realities in the life history of every Initiate. This drama is repeated in every soul that becomes a Christ. The story of the gospel was originally a religious romance intended for spiritual instruction, but the later bishops of the outer churches, not having the key to the inner meaning, accepted the romance as actual history. It is said that \"The 'common docu- ment' [which formed the basis of the canonical gos- pels] is to be traced to the sketch of an ideal life which was intended for purposes of propaganda, and which could be further explained to those who were ready for more definite instructions in the true nature of the Christ-Mystery, To a certain extent it was based on some of the traditions of the actual historic doings of Jesus, but the historical details were"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"138 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry often transformed by the light of the mystery-teach- ing, and much was added in changed form concern- ing the drama of the Christ Mystery; allegories and parables and actual mystery doings were woven into it, with what appears now to be a consummate art which has baffled for ages the intellect of the world, but which at the time was regarded by the writer as a modest effort at simplifying the spiritual truths of the Inner life, by putting them forward in the form of what we should now call a 'historical romance,' but which in his day was one of the natural methods of haggada and apocalyptic.\" (Did Jesus Live 100 Years B. C.f Mead, p. 422.) The author of this romance never dreamed that the story would be taken otherwise than as he intended it a symbol, but in the compilation of the canonical accounts much legend and historicized dogma was built around this original romance. The mystic teaching in this way became accepted first as history and finally as dogma. Irenaeus was one of the chief developers of the dogmas. The Gnostics contended that he and those like him who accepted the crude literal view, did not know the ori- gin and meaning of these things. Papius and Mar- cion, who were earlier than Irenaeus, insisted that such scripture was not reliable as absolute history. The Gnostics knew how these scriptures were made and they possessed a \"memory of the manner of things done and said from the earliest times, and looked with amazement on the narrow and cramping beliefs that the bishops of the outer churches were imposing on Christendom as the only truths of the Christ-revela- tion. . .

The Gnostics treated the gospel legends, not as his- tory, but as symbolic of cosmic processes and the drama of Initiation. I have already shown that the Gnostics did not accept the crucifixion and resurrec- tion of Jesus as historic facts. Justin Martyr also i gives evidence that the early church did not under- stand these things in a literal sense. He says, \"And when we say that the Word (Logos) which is the first begetting of God was begotten without inter- course, Jesus Christ, our Master, and that he was crucified, and was dead, and rose again and ascend- ed into heaven, we bring forward no new thing be- yond those among you who are called Sons of Zeus. For ye know how many sons the writers who are held in honor among you ascribe to Zeus: Hermes, the Word (Logos), who was the inter- preter and teacher of all; and Asclepius, who was also a healer and was smitten by the bolt [of his sire] and ascended into heaven. . . [and many others].\" (Quoted in Thrice Greatest Hermes, Mead, Vol. Ill, p. 217.) Justin Martyr here asserts that the Christians bring forward no new thing in the doctrines of Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension \"beyond those among you who are called the 'Sons of Zeus.' \" The doctrine, then, was a part of the Mysteries, well known by all who had attained to the state of Sons of God.

Justin further says, \"But as to the Son of God called Jesus, even though he were only a man [born] in the common way, [yet] because of [his] wisdom is he worthy to be called Son of God; for all writers call God 'Father of men and gods/ And if we say [further] that he was also in a special way, beyond the common birth, begotten of God [as] Word (Logos) of God, let us have this in common with you who call Hermes the Word [Logos] who brings tidings from God.\" (Ibid, p. 217.) The Sonship of Jesus, then, was considered the same as that of Hermes. And note also that \"begot- ten of God\" did not refer to physical birth, but to something beyond. Justin distinctly stated that Jesus was a man born in the common way. This higher birth by which man was begotten of God, and so be- came a \"Son,\" was not exceptional with Christianity. In fact, Justin Martyr wants it distinctly understood that he teaches nothing new, but merely claims for Jesus the distinctive title of a Son of God, in the same sense as were Hermes, Asclepius, Dionysus, and oth- ers, Sons of God, that is, he claimed Jesus was an Initiate.

The Initiate has ever been thus regarded, for to attain the Christ-state is salvation. \"The stage of discipleship was to pass into that of Sonship.

THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF FREE- MASONRY. The majority of the uninitiated believe that every- thing connected with Masonry is to be kept a secret. This is an error, for there are many books written on Masonry which are open to the perusal of all, whether they be members of or strangers to the Order. I shall divulge no pledged secrets. The Eminent Masonic Scholars, Messrs. Stillson and Hughan, in introducing the \"History of Free- masonry and Concordant Orders,\" plainly state that, \"Neither is the work necessarily for Freemasons alone; for not a few of the chapters furnish excel- lent and suggestive reading for those who would like to know somewhat of the Brotherhood either prior to joining its ranks, or because of this eligible oppor- tunity to peruse a reliable account of so venerable and pre-eminently respectable an Organization.\" Except for some portions of the Ceremony the signs and passwords which relate to the modes of recognition, there is nothing secret in Masonry. There has been so much misunderstanding on this subject that perhaps it might be well to corroborate this statement.

It is private rather than secret; for, unless it be our esoteric customs, which relate, directly or indirectly, to our universal and spe- cial modes of recognition, we have no secrets.\" Many absurd notions regarding Masonry have gained credence in the past, even among Masons themselves. We are pleased to see that modern Ma- sonic writers are endeavoring to right these miscon- ceptions. Formerly it was regarded as treason to speak to the profane the truth regarding the history of the Order. That certain exaggerated statements were made in the days when little was known of the history of the institution, gives no reason for a con- tinuance of these errors. There is no reason to-day for the pretensions that Freemasonry originated in the days of King Solomon, or with the Jewish Patriarchs, or that the fundamental doctrines of Masonry the unity of God and the Im- mortality of the soul were the exclusive possession of any one people or religion. Such claims were made before the science of comparative religions was so well known. For modern investigation of the world- religions show us that these beliefs were world-wide, and held by all the great nations of antiquity before the Jewish nation was born, or Abraham had left the valley of the Euphrates.

There is no evidence that the Jews possessed this \"interior form,\" or that Masonry itself included it before 1717 when it was intro- duced into the Order by those who had a knowledge of the Ancient Mysteries. Masonry, then, is not a lineal descendant of the Mysteries ; but is moulded upon them. The Reconstructionists built upon the ancient myths, using symbols known from the earliest days, and wove these symbols and myths derived from the Mysteries, into the symbolism of Solomon's Tem- ple. The traveling Freemasons of the Middle Ages may or may not have been descendants of the Dionysian artificers ; of this we have no evidence, nor do we know the exact date of the beginning of the Masonic movement, but are assured it can lay claim to no great antiquity the actual history of the Craft ex- tending no further back than some six centuries. And then this early organization, prior to the recon- struction period of 1717, was something quite different from its present form modern Masonry being an entirely new departure. The application of the term Freemasonry to the Ancient Mysteries, whether Jewish or Pagan, is then misleading; and the designation of the former as pure and the latter as spurious, is absurd and without any basis in fact. Both systems were derived from the same source and both are true; however, the Pagan antedated the Jewish by many thousands of years.

In corroboration of this let us note some of the connecting links between the esoteric schools of the early Christian centuries and the later Masonic move- ment. The words of the well known Masonic authority, E. Macbean, are of interest in this connection. He says, \"I may suggest that some portion at least of our sym- bolism may have come through a Templar source, Romanist, yet deeply tinged with Gnosticism; while at a later date the Lollards, (supposed to be inheritors of Manicheism), and who were but one of the many religo-political societies with which Europe was honey- combed, possibly introduced or revived some of these teachings. . . One thing is certain, that satisfactory renderings of our symbols can only be obtained by a study of Eastern Mysticism; Kabbalistic, Hermetic, Pythagorean, and Gnostic. Down the centuries we find enrolled the names of philosophic teachers who veiled their doctrines in figures similar to those in vogue among the Rosicrucians and still more recent students, and often identical with the signs we blazon on the walls of our Lodges and Chapters.\" (Hidden Sources of Masonry, Cooper-Oakley, pp. 34-35.) One tradition traces Masonry to Manicheism or The Sons of the Widow. John Yarker, in speaking of this order, says, \"About the year, 200, A. D., the most noteworthy Gnostic sect was a Persian branch of the Manichees; it was divided into three classes Auditors, Elect and Perfect, and the sect was ruled by twelve Apostles, with a thirteenth as President. . ."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"146 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry The Rite had a Theosophical Gospel, which taught that the basis of all religion was one. In 657 they had changed their names to Paulicians, and later Cathari, Euchites, Bogomiles, and in still more recent times still, Lollards. . . They were a secret spec- ulative society, with degrees, distinguished by signs, tokens and words like Freemasonry.\" (The Kneph, Vol. V, No. 4.) This order was founded by Mani, as a restatement of the old truths of the Mysteries, and contained the true Gnosis. He combined the teachings of Zoroaster with those of Jesus both being aspects of the same Wisdom, but the mystery teaching had come to be regarded as heretical by the established Orthodoxy of both religions, consequently he was put to death by the Persians, and his disciples likewise slain by the Christians. The Manicheans, from the fourth century, were bitterly persecuted by the Roman Church; the society, however, spread rapidly in spite of all opposition. Says Reghellina da Schio, a well known Italian Mason, \"In the lifetime of Manes [Mani], his pupil, Herman, had spread his teaching in Egypt, where the Coptic priests and other Christians mingled it with the Mysteries adopted from the Jews. . . It was through these same Coptic priests and the East- ern Christians that both the Mysteries of the Children of the Widow, and the cult of the Great Architect, came to us in consequence of apparently unforeseen events, and it will be seen that it was principally by means of the Crusades that they obtained a secure footing in the West.

The Crusaders who had been admitted to the mys- teries of the Children of the Widow and initiated therein, imparted them, on their return home, to their pupils in Europe.\" (Quoted in Hidden Sources of Masonry, p. 37.) The secret teaching is supposed to have passed from the Templars to the Freemasons. Eclert traces the connection of the Manicheans with the Johannes- Bruder of the West, and links them also to the Ger- man Building Corporations and Societies. The Manicheans were known at different ages un- der different names. After the death of the founder there was a fusion of the Order with some of the leading Christian Gnostic sects, thus was further in- termingled the two rich streams of Divine Wisdom: one coming from Egypt through Palestine, the other from India through Persia. The name of the ex- ternal form, which preserved the secret science through the ages, was ever changing, so we are not surprised to find one tradition tracing Freemasonry to the Gno- stic Brotherhood of St. John, and it might equally as well be ascribed to the Albigenses, Johannite Chris- tians, Troubadours, and a host of others, for all were possessors of the same mystic tradition, and transmitted their knowledge from age to age. When persecuted under one name they veiled their mys- teries under another."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"148 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry The Cologne Record, which is dated 1535, bears witness that a secret society existed before 1440, un- der the name of the Brotherhood of St. John, and since then and up to 1535 under the title of St. John's Order of Freemasonry or Masonic Brother- hood. This Record contains the following passage: \"The Brotherhood, or the Order of Freemason Brothers, bound together according to St. John's holy rules ; traces its origin neither from the Templars nor from any other spiritual or temporal Knightly Or- der, but it is older than all similar Orders, and has existed in Palestine and Greece, as well as in various parts of the Roman Empire. Before the Crusades our Brotherhood arose ; at a time when in consequence of the strife between the sects teaching Christian morals, a small number of the Initiated entrusted with the true teaching of virtue, and the sensible ex- position of the secret teaching separated themselves from the mass.\" Of course, the authenticity of this Record is rejected by materialistic Masons, but is usually accepted as genuine by all Mystic Masons. Mr. Mackensie points out that the Record is referred to in the register of the Lodge at Hague, as there in existence, so, if it is a fraud, it is one of at least two centuries standing. The mystic teaching of the Brotherhood of St. John must have been the same as that of the other mystic Orders, and the value of this Recrd is in the testimony it bears to the known existence of this| secret teaching; whether Masonry received it from the Templars or from some older organization is not important.

This may be partly true of the body as a whole, but that an inner occult teaching existed is quite evident. Gen. Pike says that \"Among Freemasons of a certain class and limited in number, the same symbolism or a large part of the same, as afterwards placed in the de- grees, did exist long before, perhaps some centuries before 1717.\" If they possessed the symbols they must have had a knowledge, in part at least, of their mean- ing. Again Gen. Pike says, \"The art of building then stood above all other arts and made all others subservient to it. It commanded the services of the most brilliant intellects and of the greatest artists. The old symbolism was embodied in the churches and cathedrals, and some of these were adorned with figures and devices which would never have been tol- erated there if the priesthood had known what they ;r,eant to the Adepts.\" This proves their possession of occult knowledge. Mr. Findel sums up the opinions of the leading Freemasons of Germany as follows: \"The Grand Lodge of Germany further assumes, that in the Build- ing Fraternities of the Middle Ages, besides their art, a secret science was carried on, the substratum of which was a real Christian Mystery, serving as a preparatory or elementary school and stepping stone to that and the St. John's Masonry, which latter was not a mere system of moral philosophy, but closely allied and connected with this mystery. It was con- ceded, that the Freemasonry of our days, (St. John's Freemasonry), sprang from the Building Fraternities of the Middle Ages, but at the same time as- serted that in the early ages there existed a secret"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"150 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry society which strove to compass the perfecting of the human race, precisely in the same manner, and em- ploying similar means, as did the Swedish system, which in fact only followed in the wake of its pre- decessor, being concealed in the Building Fraternities, so that our society did not arise from them, but made itself a way through them. The secret science, the mystery, was very ancient indeed. This mystery formed the secret of the Higher Degrees of the Rite, which were not merely kept hidden from the rest of the confederation, but also from the mem- bers of the inferior degrees of the system itself. This mystery was fully confirmed by documents, which the Grand Lodge of Germany had in its keeping. .... This secret legend is the same as that of the Carpocratians, which is that Jesus chose some of the Apostles and confided to them a secret science, which was transmitted afterwards to the priests of the Order of the Knights Templars, and through them to the Building Fraternities, down to the present Free- masons of the Swedish Rite. . .The Swedish system teaches that there have been men of all nations who have worshipped God in spirit and in truth, and sur- rounded by idolatry and superstition, have yet pre- served their purer faith. Separate from the world, and unknown to it, this Wisdom has been pre- served by them and handed down as a mys- tery.

At the period of the Saracens and, the Crusades they were so greatly oppressed that they must ultimately have sought for protection from without. As fate, however, would have it, seven of them, Sy- riac Christians, pursued by unbelievers, near Bastrum, were rescued by the Knights-Templars, and after- wards taken under their protecton. When they had lived there for a certain time they begged for permission to dwell with the Canons or Prebendaries of Jerusalem, as the life there led agreed better with their own inclinations and habits. This was accorded them, and Andreas Montebarrensis effected a union of these Syrians with the Canons, to whom, out of gratitude, they imparted all their science, and so completely did they make the priests of the order the depositories of their secrets that they kept and handed them over to others under certain conditions. Thus, this secret knowledge lived on in the very heart of the Order of Knights Templars till its' abolition. The clergy were dispersed with the persecution that ensued, but as the secular arm did not touch them, as it did the Knights, they managed to rescue many of their secret writings, and when the Knights sought refuge in Scotland, they founded a Chapter at Aber- deen, the first Prior of which was Petrus de Bononia. The science was disseminated from this place, but very cautiously, first to Italy, then to the extreme north (Sweden and Russia?), and France.\" (His- tory of Freemasonry, Findel, pp. 299-310.)

If Masonry had no part in this work, it was truly an exception to the many societies that ex- isted from the 4th. to the i8th. centuries. The early history of Freemasonry is very meagre, owing perhaps to the nature of the organization. The earliest records of actual lodge meetings were in 1599, but there are copies of \"Old Charges\" and laws dat- ing from the I4th. century. It does not appear from the oldest manuscript that they used signs, tokens, and words, such as later on were employed to secure recognition; however, such may have been the case. There were certain secrets which pertained to the art of building, which the mem- bers of the Lodge were bound to keep, and it was these trade secrets which gave to the Order its monopoly. But in the course of time the strict regulation of the guilds relaxed and there gradually grew up another body of operatives, which succeeded in breaking down t the monopoly, thus opening the way for the purely Speculative Society. The term Freemason, which originally meant a worker in free stone, came later on to be applied to all \"Craftsmen who had obtained their freedom as Masons to work in Lodges with the Fraternity after due apprenticeship and passing as Fellow Crafts.\" As early even as the oldest \"Charges\" persons not operative Masons were admitted to the Order and were designatad by the term \"Accepted,\" to dis- tinguish them from the working Masons, for many of this class were attracted to Masonry by the moral"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Origin and History of Freemasonry 153 principles, and perhaps the mystic knowledge of the Fraternity. Some of these were men of learning, and it was this class undoubtedly that had much to do with the reconstruction of the Order. The introduc- tion of this \"Speculative\" membership; that is, those who did not follow the trade as a means of livelihood, proved a most fortunate thing for the preservation of the Order at a time when the old \"Charges\" had practically ceased to be influential. Had this not been done it is doubtful if the Institution of Freemasonry would have been in existence to-day. Speculative Masonry existed as far back as the oldest \"Charges,\" but the proportion which the Spec- ulative element bore to the Operative is not known. From the few records we have of the i/th. century, it would seem that at that time the great majority were Speculative Freemasons, although some bodies were chiefly Operative. We learn from the old records that Apprentices served seven years, and that being passed to Fellow Crafts depended upon the result of an examination as to their operative skill, and likewise the passing of Fellow Crafts to Master Masons. Of course, this did not apply to the honorary members. Apprentices were members and exercised all the privileges as such, just the same as Fellow Crafts and Masters, for at that time the separate Masonic degrees had not come into existence. Three grades or classes were recog- nized, but this did not signify esoteric stages, and we find no intimations of two or more degrees being worked before the \"revival\" of 1717.

The two moving spirits were Dr. Anderson and Dr. Desaguliers and at their hands the Order saw a complete change in 1717. During that year four Lodges met in Lon- don on June 24, and formed the premier Grand Lodge of the World. This, however, did not include the Masonic body at York. The York Masons remained independent, and formed in 1725 a Grand Lodge of their own, called the Grand Lodge of all England. This body continued until 1790, but it never chartered Lodges outside of England. Dr. Anderson and Dr. Desaguliers, together with other old members chosen for their ability, were des- ignated by the Order to formulate a new and better method of the history, charges, regulations, etc. As the result of their work we have the Free and Ac- cepted Masonry, founded on the apochryphal legend of \"Hiram,\" and the \"Symbolism of Solomon's Tem- ple.\" In the formation of degrees many of the customs of the ancient Mysteries were adopted. The third or Master's Degree, based upon the \"Hiram\" legend, came into use about 1723, in fact, the whole degree system was the work of the Reconstructionists. Says Dr. Mackey, \"It is now the opinion of the best scholars, that the division of the Masonic system into degrees was the work of the Revivalists of the beginning of the i8th century; that before that period there was but one degree, or rather one common plat-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Origin and History of Freemasonry 155 form of ritualism ; and that was the division into Mas- ters, Fellows, and Apprentices was simply a division of ranks, there being but one Initiation for all.\" (Art.

D. 1717 (of which I have either seen the originals or have certified copies), and have not been able to find any reference to three degrees.\" (Quoted in \"Four Old Lodges,\" p. 40.) Mr. Gould, another well known Masonic writer, says that there is no evidence to indicate the ex- istence of the \"Second degree, as now practiced until after the year 1717, nor of the Third degree until the year 1735.\" (Quoted by C.

The immediate source from which this material was derived is not definitely known. Many have thought that the Reconstruction- ists derived it from the Rosicrucians and Bacon's \"New Atlantis.\" Mr. Hughan says that Wigston's books on \"Bacon, Shakespeare and the Rosicrucians\" and \"Francis Bacon, Poet, Prophet and Philosopher,\" contain Rosicrucian and Baconic ideas, which influ- enced the Masonic Reconstructionists of 1717. He again says that \"The New Atlantis seems to be, and probably is, the key to the modern ritual of Free- masonry.\" (Ibid, p. XXXI.} Masonry is thoroughly Hermetic and Kabbalistic, and the framers of these degrees were evidently Kab- balistic and Hermetic philosophers, and well ac- quainted with all these works and other mystic writ- ings. Mr. Singleton, 33d degree, Sec. M. W. Grand Lodge, District of Columbia, says, \"The Kabbalists were the inventors of the rituals of the original de- grees, and Kabbalistic scholars in France and Ger- many have multiplied the degrees by elaborating upon the 'legends' of the first three. . .There was origin- ally in Speculative Masonry but one ritual, which was very simple; out of that one trunk have grown all the branches, and the fruit from these bears the re- semblance of Hermeticism and the Kabbalah. . .

Mr. Moore, already quoted, says, \"Some of these rites would appear to be derived from the Hermetic philosophy of the German school, of which no proof exists; but when philosophers, with others, joined the Craft Lodges in the iyth century, they may have in- troduced some of their Hermetic Rosicrucian symbols into Masonry.\" (Ibid, p. 759). Gen. Pike, the eminent American Masonic author- ity, says that to \"The men of intelligence who be- longed to one of the lodges in 1717, is to be ascribed the authorship of the third degree and the introduction of Hermetic and other symbols into Masonry; they formed the three degrees for the purpose of communi- cating their doctrines, veiled by their symbols ex- cept to those fitted to receive them, and to give to all others trite moral explanations of them which they could receive.\" The plan was worked out by these Reconstructionists and formally approved and ac- cepted in 1723, becoming known as the new constitu- tion, and is the Freemasonry of to-day. (Anderson's Constitutions, 1723). In 1730 a work called \"Masonry Dissected,\" ap- peared. This purported to be a revelation of Free and Accepted Masonry. As the result of this many spur- ious Lodges were formed. The Grand Lodge en- deavored to thwart this by introducing certain changes in the pass-words, etc. These alterations caused much dissatisfaction, and many withdrew from the regular Lodges and formed Lodges of their own. These seceders finally formed an independent body in"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"158 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry 1751, and assumed the name \"Ancient York Masons.\" They claimed to have preserved the old forms thus the name \"Ancient,\" and they called the regular Grand Lodge the \"Moderns.\" Both Grand Lodges were prosperous and extended their influence even into America, thus producing dissension not only at home but abroad. The strife between these two Grand Lodges continued until 1813, when a union was ef- fected under the title of the United Grand Lodge. A union was also effected in America, thus ending the schism, and to constitute a regular mode of work a union degree was adopted. The Grand Lodge of Ire- land was formed in 1728, and the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1736. There is no uniformity in the degree system in the different countries. To the three symbolic de- grees, others have been added from time to time, but there has been no uniformity in their acceptance. The Royal Arch appeared about 1740, but by whom it was founded is not known, though it is clearly of English origin. There is no record of its being worked in Chapters until 1762, when a chapter of the Royal Arch was formed at York. It became the fourth de- gree in the Ancient Grand Lodge system. The \"Mod- erns\" did not recognize this degree or adopt it officially until 1767. Upon the union it became a part of the English Rite. The Mark degree also originated about this time. It was formerly conferred in England under Royal Arch warrants, but later was governed by an inde- pendent Grand Lodge of its own. The Past Master degree is undoubtedly one of evo- lution.

This degree was finally adopted as a separate degree by the Royal Arch system, and transferred from the Lodge to the Chapter. Although its origin is obscure, it was conferred during the lat- ter part of the i8th century. The Most Excellent de- gree is also obscure in origin, but we find it also con- ferred in the latter part of the i8th century. In many instances the higher degrees were worked under Lodge warrants by those interested, without interference from the Grand Lodge. The brethren concerned came to- gether and conferred the higher degrees. They were at first purely side degrees, but after a time they be- came organized independently. Royal Arch Masonry separated from Blue Lodge Masonry, organized itself and adopted or invented the four degrees just con- sidered, and began an independent existence. In the same way the Royal and Select Masters separated themselves from the Lodge of Perfection and formed Councils, and finally organized Grand Councils and became also independent. As already stated, there is no uniformity in the different countries concerning these higher degrees. The system in England is unknown in France and Germany. The American system, known as the York Rite, consists of the Craft degrees or Blue Lodge, the Royal Arch Chapter, the Council and the Knights Templars, and is peculiar to this country. It was formulated by Thomas Smith Webb, who, with his associates constructed, out of the conglomeration of the work of the \"Ancients\" and \"Moderns\" that had previously been established in this country, a new work, which Cross and others afterwards embellished."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"160 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Webb tried to show that he had adopted the true work of the Ancient York Masons, but it is well known that the claim is without foundation.

THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS AND THE AN- CIENT AND ACCEPTED SCOTTISH RITE. We will first consider the Military Order of the Knights Templars of the Crusades. This organization was originally called the Order of the Temple, and was founded in 1118-1119 A. D., by nine Benedictine Monks, who resided in Monasteries at Jerusalem. The object of the Order was the defense of the Holy Sep- ulcher and the protection of the Christian pilgrims who visited the sacred shrine. The holy place had been desecrated and the Christians persecuted by both Saracen and Turk. The Christian Monks joined the Patriarch of Jerusalem in guarding the approach to the city, and lived under the Benedictine rule, fight- ing for the cause of the Church. The Patriarch as- signed them quarters in the palace of the Latin Kings of Jerusalem, sometimes called Solomon's Temple, and it was this that gave the Templar name to the Order. The new Order rendered valiant service to the pil- grims and others in need; their fame spread rapidly and their ranks as rapidly increased by recruits from the religious fraternities in Europe, members of the French nobility, and then from all classes of society."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"162 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry These recruits were organized by skillful military leaders and before long became renowned in the art of war. The Order was strictly a religious body and was composed of three classes, Knights, Chaplains and Serving Brothers. A council was held in 1128 to determine the statutes of the Order. Rules of dis- cipline and obligations numbering seventy-two were adopted. At a later date they were elaborated into a more complete ritual. In our last lecture we mentioned that the early Templars possessed a secret doctrine. The early Freemasons also taught in secret, making it difficult to trace one without mentioning the other. I need here only to recall that the secret science had passed along from age to age, until received by the Knights Templars. According to the record of the German Lodges the Templars received their mystic teaching from certain Syriac Christians, but of what particular doctrine, cult or order they do not state. Perhaps they were members of the Brotherhood of St. John, which, according to the Cologne Record, possessed a mystic teaching or perhaps they were members of the Johannian Christians; again, perhaps these two socie- ties may have been of the same or a very similar or- der. The Johannites were also called \"Christians of the East.\" There is a tradition that traces the secret teaching of the Templars to the Johannites, so it is more than probable that the Syriac Christians were members of this Brotherhood. This tradition, as given by Gen. Pike, states that \"There existed at that period in the East a sect of Johannite Christians, who claimed to be the only true Initiates into the real Mysteries of the religion of the"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Origin and History of the K. T. and A. A. S. R. 153 Savior. They pretended to know the real history of Jesus the Anointed, and, adopting in part the Jewish traditions and the tales of the Talmud, they held that the facts recounted in the Evangels are but allegories. . . . The Johannites ascribe to St. John the foun- dation of their Secret Church, and the Grand Pontiffs of the Sect assumed the title of Christos, Anointed or Consecrated, and claimed to have succeeded one an- other from St. John by an uninterrupted succession of pontifical powers. He who, at the period of the foundation of the Order of the Temple, claimed these imaginary prerogatives, was named Theoclet.\" (Mor- als and Dogma, Pike, p. 816.) Theoclet was ac- quainted with Hugh de Payens, the founder of the Order of the Temple, and initiated him into the Jo- hannian Mysteries and appointed him his successor. Now if the Brotherhood of St. John and the Jo- hannian Christians are the same, then both the Tem- plars and the Freemasons received their secret doc- trine from the same order. It is claimed by some, however, that the mystic teaching passed to the Ma- sons from the Templars. This may or may not have been the case, but that they were closely allied is evi- dent from the fact that upon the destruction of the old Templar Order many of its members took refuge with the Freemasons. The secret statutes of the Templars were preserved, not only by oral tradition, but were also written, in part at least. Dr. Prutz says, \"Gervais de Beauvias saw at one of the heads of the Orders a little book with the Statutes of the Order of 1128, which was shown without thinking, and he knew that the same man had also possessed another book about which he was very"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"164 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry mysterious and which he 'would not show any one for all the world.' ' ( Geheimelehre des Templherren Or dens, p. 45.) W. J. MacLeod Moore, 33rd degree, in speaking of the Temple Order, says, \"Their Rulers arrogated to themselves a higher degree of knowledge in all things, and taught in their secret conclaves, where none but the most trusted members were ad- mitted, that the Papal power was a false and dan- gerous assumption of authority over the minds and consciences of men, and that very many of the dogmas of Rome were gross and childish superstitions. They also cultivated and asserted more liberal views of faith and religion than were current at the time, be- ing well versed in the Mysteries, legends, learning and traditions of the peoples they had come in contact with in the East.\" (History of Freemasonry and Concordant Orders, p. 765.) The evidence that the early Templar Order pos- sessed a secret doctrine being conclusive, we will now return to the historical development. The Order spread rapidly and was soon established in every kingdom of Latin Christendom. The part which the Templars took in the Crusades is too well known to need reiteration, for from that time on the history of the Templars was the history of the Cru- sades. When the Crusades terminated the Templars re- turned to their numerous Preceptories in Europe, as the Order was of no further use as a military body. Their great wealth and power aroused the jealously of Philip IV. of France, who coveted the possessions of the Order, and the Pope distrusted its fidelity to the Papacy. A bitter hatred was engendered by many"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Origin and History of the K. T. and A. A. S. R. 165 acts of insubordination against the king's arbitrary authority, and he set about to work their de- struction; to this end calumnies of every description were circulated, they were charged with heresy and all manner of crimes. Philip enlisted the support of Pope Clement V., who owed his papal tiara to the King's gold or influence, and the overthrow was brought about. The work of suppression was too heart- less to recite. Many were cast into prison, and tor- tured to confess crimes of which they were ignorant, and finally were burned to death upon fagots. The Grand Master De Molai was seized while in Paris by special invitation of Pope Clement, cast into prison, where he was kept seven years, and at last taken out and burned at the stake. On May 2, 1312, Clement issued his famous Bull transferring the estates of the Templars, except those in Spain and Portugal, to the Knights of St. John. Thus perished the Order of the Temple. What became of the thousands of Templars upon the sup- pression of the Order is not definitely known. Some may have joined the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, upon which the confiscated lands of the Templars had been conferred, and some, as already intimated, may have taken refuge in the Guilds of Stone Masons. Many reject this latter theory as being without \"historic foundation,\" but W. S. Perry, 32nd degree, says regarding this, \"We do not question this state- ment as it stands. History fails to record much that actually occurs, much that subsequent ages would gladly know. We see no reason, however, for the assertion, so often made of late years, that any con- nection between a Chivalric Order, such as the"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"166 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Knights Templars, and a fraternity of Operative Ma- sons, such as certainly existed in Mediaeval times, is out of the range of possibility.\" (Ibid, p. 140.) Mr. Perry then goes on to argue that the Guilds were known and even employed by the Knights Templars in the construction of their Churches, Preceptories, and strongholds, all over Europe and the Holy Land, and when they were despoiled they would naturally seek protection among the body with which they had already a certain connection. Henry E. Manning, Cardinal Archbishop of West- minster, says, \"As far back as the I2th century, the Lodges of the Guild enjoyed the special protection of the Knights Templars. It is easy in this way to understand how the symbolical allusion to Solomon and His Temple might have passed from the Knights into the Masonic formulary. In this way, too, might be explained how, after the suppression of the Order of the Temple, some of the recalcitrant Knights, main- taining their influence over the Freemasons, would be able to pervert what hitherto had been a harmless ceremony into an elaborate ritual that should impart some of the errors of the Templars to the Initiated.\" (Ibid, p. 144.) This Catholic writer may know whereof he speaks, as it is generally supposed that Catholic scholars have access to certain records not accessible to others, therefore, it is not improbable that the old Order continued to exist within the Guilds of Stone Masons. It is also said that when the time came that they could safely proclaim the continuance of their Order, they instituted the Rite of Strict Observance and proved iheir gratitude for the protection afforded by receiv-"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Origin and History of the K. T. and A. A. S. R. 167 ing members only from the ranks of Freemasonry. But it is also not unlikely, as pointed out by Mr. Moore, that \"Small organizations were kept up in many places, and the hope cherished that it would be possible to revive the Order. A great and exten- sive organization could not wholly have lost its vital- ity and died out without a struggle.\" (Ibid, p. 768.) It is related of the Chief of the doomed Order that before his execution he instituted what afterward came to be called Occult, Hermetic, or Scottish Mason- ry ; that the Order, while seeming to die, nevertheless lived under other names, and was revealed to those who proved themselves worthy to be trusted. Ac- cording to these traditions the real lineal descendants of the Old Chivalric Orders are the Scottish Rite and the Strict Observance. Let us consider for a moment this Rite of the Strict Observance. It is common with a certain class of Masonic writ- ers to pronounce the leading spirits of the Strict Ob- servance, dupes and charlatans. But the long list of scholars, nobles, and officers of high standing who have belonged to this Order must preclude any such classification. The reason for such stigmatization is that the members were students of Mysticism, and believed that there is hidden in Masonry an occult and mystic tradition which is the true history of spiritual evolution. Many of these members of the Strict Ob- servance also belonged to the Rosicrucians and other allied bodies, and all were seeking the old \"Strait Gate\" and \"Narrow Path\" that leads to Wisdom. One of the most striking personages of this period is Charles Gotthelf, a nobleman, born in 1722. \"He"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"158 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry entered the Masonic Order in 1742, when at Frank- fort-on-Main. In the next year he is said to have established a Lodge at Paris, and while staying with the French Army he became acquainted with the heads of a Rite which pretended to be, in its higher degrees, the continuation of the famous Order of Knights Templars. According to his repeated decla- rations, maintained even on his death bed, he was re- ceived into this Order, in Paris, by Lord Kilmarnock, Grand Master of Scotland, a Jacobite nobleman, on which occasion Lord Clifford acted as Prior. He was presented to a very high member of the Order, a mysterious personage called only 'the Knight of the Red Feather.' Perhaps this was Prince Charles Ed- ward himself. Von Hund supposed him to be the Supreme Grand Master of the Order, and was ap- pointed by him coadjutor of the Seventh Province of the Order (Germania Inferior). Hund visited Scot- land also, where he was bidden to raise the Order in Germany, together with the then Master of the Sev- enth Province, de Marschall, whom he always consid- ered his predecessor. Marschall had founded Lodges at Altenburg and Naumburg, but found only in the latter men worthy of being led further, viz., to be re- ceived into the Templar degrees.\" ( This is a summary by Cooper-Oakley in \"Traces of a Hidden Tradition\" of an article in the \"Transactions of Logge Quator Co- ronati\" No. 2076.) Reghellini says of Von Hund: \"In 1756 the wars had caused the Prussian (Masonic) Lodges to be abandoned. Baron de Hund, who had received the High Templar's Degree in the Chapter of Clermont at Paris, on returning to Berlin declared that he had"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Origin and History of the K. T. and A. A. S. R. 169 been raised to the dignity of Grand-Master of the Templars by M. Marschall, who called himself the successor of the G-'-G-'- Master Templars by uninter- rupted transmission from the time of Jacques de Molai; that Marschall on his death-bed had delegated this high dignity to him, and had declared him his successor; transmitting to him all his powers and dignities. He did not omit to give Hund a list of all the names of the Templar Grand Mas- ters, which must therefore have been a curi- ous contrast to the list of the Order of the Temple of Paris. Hund placed himself at the head of the German reformers; he persuaded them that his Rite would restore Freemasonry to its ancient brilliancy and its former splendor. . . His principles were altogether philosophical. . . He maintains that these Pontiffs are the only Priests of the True Light, the Worshipers of God, and the disciples of the pure doctrines of Jesus and of John.\" (\"Traces of a Hid- den Tradition,\" 82.) In this connection we need to note one Johann Au- gustus Starck, a teacher of Oriental languages and a student of theology and philosophy. He had held many public positions, among others that of inter- preter of Oriental manuscript at the Royal Library in Paris. Mrs. Cooper-Oakley says, \"Starck held that the mystic traditions of the Knights Templars, de- rived by them from those still older fraternities with whom they had come in contact in the East, were pre- served among the clericals of that Order who had cherished their unbroken continuity until his days, and he announced that he was in communication with certain Superiors, or Chiefs of the Order.\" (Ibid, P. 840"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"170 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry R. F. Gould, a well known English authority, writ- ing on the Strict Observance, says, \"On February 1 7th, 1767, some Masons, chief amongst whom may be mentioned Von Vegesack, Von Bohnen and Stark, founded at Wismar the Lodge of the 'Three Lions,' and attached thereto a Scots Lodge, 'Gustavus of the Golden Hammer.' Shortly afterward they added a hitherto unknown body, a Clerical Chapter. To these brethren we are indebted for the historical fic- tion [sic] that the Knights Templars were divided into military and sacerdotal members; that the latter possessed all the secrets and mystic learning of the Order; and that they had preserved a continuous ex- istence down ' to the eighteenth century. Stark claimed to be the emissary of these Clerical Templars, asserted their and his own superiority over the Secular Knights, and offered, on his claims being ac- knowledged, to impart their valuable secrets to Von Hund and his disciples. Stark (1741-1816) was a student of Gottingen, and a very learned man, an Ori- ental linguist of great attainments, and had held sci- entific appointments in St. Petersburg, Paris, Wismar and elsewhere.\" (History of Freemasonry, Gould, V ., p. 104.) Gould regards Stark as an impostor, but like many other materialistic critics who reject the tradition, he offers no proof of its falsity. In reply to the criticism that the Knights Templars could not have continued to exist for 438 years un- known to the outside world, Stark says, \"If he [Dr. Biester] had been somewhat better acquainted with ecclesiastical history, he would have found not only one, but several religious bodies, which under far more"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Origin and History of the K.

This view is upheld by C. W. King, a modern writer of note, who, speaking of the Templars, says, \"Con- sidering how widely the Order has spread. . . it would be a mere absurdity to believe that all its tra- ditions were swept away at one stroke by the sup- pression of the Templars in the year 1307.\" (The Gnostics and Their Remains, King, p. 399.) Stark shows the large number of scholars in his day who accepted the tradition. Can it be that all these were dupes and charlatans? We must now pass to a brief consideration of the Order itself. Ragon, a noted Masonic writer, in speaking of the Strict Observance, says that in Ger- many a body was formed, \"Approaching more nearly to the true institution than the ordinary Freemasons. The study of the Kabbalah, of the Philosophers' Stone and of Necromancy or the invocation of spirits, occu- pied the \\ chiefly, because according to them all these sciences formed the system and the object and end of the ancient mysteries of which Freemasonry is the sequel.\" (Quoted from Orthodoxie Maconnique, Ra- gon, p. 210, by Mr. Cooper-Oakley in Hidden Tradi- tion, p. 88.) It was the higher grades of the Strict Observance that took up the study of Alchemy, etc., there being, according to our author just quoted, seven grades in- to which the system wasi divided."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"172 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Much more might be said, but this is sufficient to show that in the early days of the Modern Knights Templars there were many who recognized the exist- ence of the secret doctrine. As to the origin of the Knights Templars of to-day, and their connection with Freemasonry, various theo- ries have been proposed. Some contend that the movement was the result of the numerous works of the 1 7th and i8th centuries on occult philosophy, and that upon the dispersion of the Order of St. John and the Templars of Scotland, the secret ceremonies and principles were obtained and promulgated, which di- rectly led to the revival of the Chivalric Orders under the impression that they were of Masonic origin. Others hold that the present Order originated from the High Grades of Freemasonry, the Hermetic, or Scottish system, and was grafted on to Freemasonry by Baron Hund in 1754. Few, if any, would main- tain to-day that the present organization of Knights Templars is a lineal descendant of the old Chivalric Order. The Knights Templars of the present, in common with Masons in general, make no claim to mystic knowledge, and but few in the Order even know that such a Wisdom-science ever existed. The degrees of the American system of the Knights Templars are the Knight of the Red Cross, Knight Templar, and Knight of Malta. The Red Cross is not embraced in the English, Continental or Canadian systems. The Templar degrees have been used in connection with Freemasonry for about a cen- tury. Says W. J. B. MacLeod Moore, \"Although the Templar degrees have been in connection with Free- masonry for about a century past, it does not follow"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Origin and History of the K. T. and A. A. S. R. 173 that they previously had any such connection. It was only about that time, or a few years earlier, that the error was made in Great Britain and Ireland of add- ing the chivalric Templar Order to the Masonic sys- tems.\" (History of Freemasonry and Concordant Orders, p. 744.) The Templar degrees, like the other side degrees, were first conferred under Blue Lodge Warrants, which simply means that Masons possess- ing those degrees came together in their Lodges and worked them. In the course of time Chapters and Encampments were organized, and Templarism took on a more independent and permanent form. We believe with Mr. Moore that it was an error to merge the Templar degrees into the Masonic system. In England the Templar system has always been kept separate from the Craft degrees. The Royal Arch is there considered the climax of Freemasonry. There is also a difference due to the fact that the English degrees are based upon the old Templar ceremonies, while the American system is based upon the craft degrees. This makes the American system broader and more in harmony with the spirit of Freemasonry, although it is still partly sectarian. This sectarianism is not in accord with the ancient landmarks and genius of Masonry. If we have the right to Christianize Masonry, so have Moslems, Buddhists, and all other religious sects, a right to transform it to fit their creeds ; such transformations and limitations deprive Masonry of its true spirit and universal character, and should such a process become general Masonry itself would soon be destroyed.

The very name \"Masonic Tem- plarism'' is a .misnomer the sectarian character of the one is not in accord with the universal character of the other. This declaration does not cast any re- flection upon the Templar degrees; in fact, we con- sider them among the best and most inspiring of the American system; however, we believe they should have remained separated from a non-sectarian body. \"It is a mistake,\" to again quote Mr. Moore, \"to con- nect Templarism with Freemasonry.\" Frederic Speed, 33rd degree Past R. E. Grand Commander, Miss., is of the same opinion. He says, \"If, then, anywhere the door of any degree is closed against him who believes in one God and the soul's immortality, on account of other tenets of his faith, that degree is not Freemasonry. That the Templar degrees [properly] form no part of Masonry, we have the declaration of the reputed author of the American Rituals, Thomas Smith Webb, who, in 1812, and sev- eral subsequent editions of his 'Freemason's Monitor,' says, 'Although the several orders of Knighthood are conferred both in Europe and America, reputedly under the sanction of Masonic assemblies,' they 'compose no part of the system of Freemasonry.' \" He tells us that in America they are conferred as \"honorary de- grees.\" Mr. Speed continues, \"It is time for intelli- gent Masons to divest themselves of the superlatively ridiculous and often exploded idea that there is any connection between what we now know as Templar- ism and the Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, except that which is found in the restriction of its membership to those who have first received the sev-"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Origin and History of the K.

It is entirely com- patible with all the obligations of Masonry that a Mason should be a Templar, and we do not derogate from our standing as Masons, when we take upon our- selves the additional vows of the Knights Templars; but this does not make Templarism Masonry, nor do we add anything; to the dignity and high character of the Order by making the assertion that it is.\" (Ibid, P- 735-) ANCIENT AND ACCEPTED SCOTTISH RITE. The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite or Scot- tish Masonry did not originate in Scotland, as its name might lead one to suppose. It was derived from a body in France, formerly known as \"The Emperors of the East and West,\" who organized in 1758, in Paris, a Rite called \"The Rite of Perfection,\" con- sisting of twenty-five degrees, to which eight or more were subsequently added. The immediate source from which the French Ma- sons derived these Rites is unknown, but it is held by some that they are the lineal descendants of the an- cient Order of the Temple. Before the death of Grand Master Jacques de Molai, and while he was in prison awaiting execution, he instituted several Metro- politan Lodges, one of which was at Paris, and it was from this source that Scottish Masonry was derived. Gen. Pike, the great authority on the Scottish Rite, accepts this view. The name itself is supposed to have come from a number of Scottish Masons who were in France at the time of the organization. A Grand Lodge was formed at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1783, a Supreme Council, 33rd degree, in"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"176 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry 1801 ; and the Rite has been called by its present name, Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, since that date. The Rite is founded on the Symbolic degrees, and is conferred only on Master Masons. Its degrees be- gin with the 4th and extend to the 33rd. They are conferred in subordinate bodies as follows: The Lodge of Perfection 4th to I4th inclusive; the Coun- cil of Princes of Jerusalem i5th and i6th; the Chap- ter of Rose Croix I7th and i8th; the Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret iQth to 32nd except in the Southern Jurisdiction where the iQth. to 3Oth. degrees constitute a Council of Kadosh and their Consistory begins with the 3ist. degree; and the Su- preme Council, whose officers are Active 33rd. de- gree Masons. There is also an Honorary 33rd. degree conferred by the Supreme Council as a merit for dis- tinguished service in the Fraternity. The moral teaching of these degrees is exemplary and the dramatic effect of the work is beyond com- parison. We have neither time nor space to consider the system in detail, but there are certain teachings connected with some of the degrees to which your special attention is directed. We refer to those which, by some, are thought to be sectarian in charac- ter, and therefore opposed to the original plan of the Reconstructionists to lay a broad foundation for the ceremonies which would admit men of all religions. It is to be regretted that such a cosmopolitan basis could not have been maintained. We need to remember, however, that Masonry is symbolic and the legends, even of the so-called sec- tarian degrees, are symbols used to set forth an inner truth, and are not in themselves necessarily sectarian,"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Origin and History of the K. T. and A.A.S.R. 177 even when appropriated by a special religion, for they are essentially universal, and belong to general re- ligion. To illustrate more fully, Dr. Mackey, in speaking of the Cryptic degrees, which are based upon the le- gend of the Sacred Vault, says, \"To support this le- gend there is no historic evidence and no authority except that of the Talmudic writers. It is clearly a mythical symbol, and as such we must accept it. . . . Like every other myth and allegory of Ma- sonry, the historical relation may be true, or it may be false ; it may be founded on fact, or be the inven- tion of imagination; the lesson is still there, and the symbolism teaches it, exclusive of the history.\" (En- cyclopedia of Freemasonry, p. 852.) Gen. Pike also emphasizes this principle. In speak- ing of the legend upon which the degree of the Royal Arch is based, he says, \"It is of but little importance whether it is in anywise historical. For its value con- sists in the lessons which it inculcates, and the duties which it prescribes to those who receive it. The par- ables and allegories of the Scriptures are not less valu- able than history. Nay, they are more so, because ancient history is little instructive, and truths are con- cealed in and symbolized by the legend and the Myth.\" (Morals and Dogma, p. 210.) We should bear this fact in mind when we con- sider the degrees of the Scottish Rite, especially that of the Rose Croix. The legend upon which this de- gree is based is purely symbolical, and as such con- veys a grand truth. Some, however, have thought that the doctrine of this degree excluded the non- Christian, which shows how the purpose of Masonry has been misunderstood."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"178 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Gen. Pike, in speaking of the degree, says, \"No Mason has the right to interpret the symbols of this degree for another, or to refuse him its mysteries, if he will not take them with the explanation and com- mentary superadded.\" Again he says, \"Each of us makes such applications to his own faith and creed of the symbols and ceremonies of this degree, as seems to him proper.\" (Morals and Dogma, Ch. XVIII.) This is well said. Every intelligent Mason should make a protest against the crude and antiquated ex- planations of the symbols given in this degree. The degree itself is not necessarily sectarian, but the ex- planations adopted in the work are not only sectarian and un-Masonic, but they belong to a system of things which intelligent people are fast leaving behind. Let me briefly summarize the explanation given by the authority just quoted. The cross has been a sa- cred symbol from the earliest antiquity. It is found upon all the enduring monuments of the world, in Egypt, Assyria, India, Persia, Mexico, etc. Its peculiar meaning in this degree is that given to it by the ancient Egyptian Thoth or Phtha, who is repre- sented on the oldest monuments carrying in his hand the Crux Ansata, a tau cross with a ring over it. This was the hieroglyph for life, and with a triangle prefixed meant life-giving. To us, therefore, it is the symbol of life, of that life that emanates from Deity and of that Eternal life for which we hope. The Rose was anciently sacred to Aurora and the Sun. It is a symbol of dawn, of the resurrection, Light, and the renewal of Life. The Cross and Rose together signify hieroglyphically, the Dawn of Eter- nal Life and the advent of a Saviour for which all"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Origin and History of the K. T. and A.A.S.R. 179 nations hope. To the letters \"I. N. R. I.\" inscribed on the Crux Ansata, many meanings have been as- signed. The Christian sees in them the initials of the inscription upon the Cross of Christ IESUE NAZARE- MUS REX IUDEORUM. The Sages of antiquity con- nected it with one of the greatest secrets of nature, that of universal regeneration. They interpreted it thus : IGNE NATURA RENOVATUR INTEGRA Nature is renovated by fire. The Alchemists and Hermetic Ma- sons framed for it this aphorism, IGNE NITRUM RORIS INVENITUR. The letters are initials of the Hebrew words that represent the four elements IAMMIM, the sea or water; NOUR, fire; ROUACH, the air; IEBE- SCHAH, the earth. (Ibid, Ch. XVIII.) This degree symbolized the final triumph of truth over falsehood, of life over death, of good over evil. \"No one Mason has a right to measure for another within the walls of a Masonic Temple, the degree of veneration which he shall feel for any Reformer, or Founder of any Religion. We teach a belief in no par- ticular creed as we teach unbelief in none.\" (Ibid, p. 308.) But we recognize in the Founder of the Christian religion, an Initiate into the True Mysteries ; one who came to rebuild again the eternal verities, to utter again the Divine Wisdom to a needy world. The Knight of the Rose Croix will revere his memory, and honor him as one of the true servants of the Most High. We recognize all Initiates as Brothers. We belong to no creed. We invite men of all religions to enlist under our banner and work to bring in a better day. Dr. Mackey says, \"If Masonry were simply a Chris- tian institution, the Jew and the Moslem, the Brahmin and the Buddhist, could not conscientiously partake"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry of its illumination; but its universality is its boast. In its language citizens of every nation may converse ; at its altar men of all religions may kneel ; to its creed disciples of every faith may subscribe.\" (The Sym- bolism of Freemasonry, Mackey, p. 237.) We have dwelt upon this degree because of the principle involved. The legends upon which this de- gree is based, while drawn from the New Testament, are also to be found in many other world Scriptures, for the symbolism, of which the real meaning has been shown in earlier lectures, is universal. The degree itself is really out of place in the Scottish Rite sys- tem; it should belong in the Templar system, if any- where. To again quote Gen. Pike, \"We teach the truth of none of the legends we recite. They are to us but parables and allegories, involving and enveloping Ma- sonic instruction; the vehicles of useful and interest- information. . . Every one being at liberty to apply our symbols and emblems as he thinks most consistent with truth and reason and with his own faith.\" (Morals and Dogma, p. 329.) Let every Scottish Rite Mason bear this fact in mind; and it would be well for the Knight Templar to remember this also, for there we have the same symbols and the same crude interpretation of them. These symbols, as we have seen, refer to realities in the divine life of Jesus, rather than to the incidents in his physical experi- ences. In the early days of the Scottish Rite the system was full of grotesque and incongruous things, of con- tradictions and fantastic extravagances.

This was the method of instruction in the An- cient Mysteries, and it was naturally adopted in the institution of Freemasonry. \"To form symbols and to interpret them,\" says Creuzer, \"were the main oc- cupations of the ancient priesthood,\" and the myths were invented to illustrate a philosophic or religious truth. Dr. Mackey, after discussing the question of myths, says, \"It must be evident, from all that has been said respecting the analogy in origin and design between the Masonic and the ancient religious myths, that no one acquainted with the true science of this subject can, for a moment, contend that all the legends and traditions of the order are, to the very letter, histor- ical facts.\" (Symbolism of Freemasonry, Mackey, p. 207.) He gives as an illustration of this the myth of the Winding Stairs, which, he says, \"taken in its literal sense, is, in all its parts, opposed to history and probability.\" Again, he calls attention to the myth which traces the origin of Freemasonry to the beginning of the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 183 world, \"A myth, which is,\" he says, \"even to this day, ignorantly interpreted, by some, as an historical fact, and the reference to which is still preserved in the date of 'anno lucis/ which is affixed to all masonic documents.\" This he calls a \"philosophical myth, symbolizing the idea which analogically connects the creation of physical light in the universe with the birth of masonic or spiritual and intellectual light in the candidate. The one is the type of the other.\" (Ibid, p. 211.) In the legends of the Master's De- gree and of the Royal Arch he points out that there is a commingling of the historical myth and the myth- ical history so that much care must be taken in dis- criminating between the different elements. Dr. Mackey then sums up the duty of a Mason as follows, \"He who desires properly to appreciate the profound wisdom of the institution of which he is the disciple, must not be content, with uninquiring cred- ulity, to accept all the traditions that are imparted to him as veritable histories ; nor yet, with unphilosophic incredulity, to reject them in a mass, as fabulous in- ventions. In these extremes there is equal error. 'The myth/ says Hermann, 'is the representation of an idea.' It is for that idea that the student must search in the myths of Masonry. Beneath every one of them there is something richer and more spirit- ual than the mere narrative. . . Every one, therefore, who desires to be a skillful Mason, must not suppose that the task is accomplished by a perfect knowledge of the mere phraseology of the ritual, by a readiness in opening and closing a lodge, nor by an off-hand capacity to confer degrees. All these are good in their places, but without the internal mean-"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"184 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry ing they are but mere child's play. He must study the myths, the traditions, and the symbols of the order, and learn their true interpretation ; for this alone con- stitutes the science and the philosophy the end, aim, and design of Speculative Masonry.\" (Ibid, p. 212, 214.) These deeper things, as Dr. Mackey intimates, are not found in the monitorial explanations. J. D. Buck, a 32nd degree Mason, in his wonderful book on Mys- tic Masonry, says, \"The most profound secrets of Masonry are not revealed in the Lodge at all. They belong only to the few. . . But these secrets must be sought by the individual himself, and the candidate is debarred from possessing them solely by his own inattention to the hints everywhere given in the ritual of the Lodge, or by his indifference to the subject If he prefers to treat the whole subject with contempt, and to deny that any such real knowedge exists, it becomes evident that he not only closes the door against the possibility of himself possessing such knowledge, but he also becomes impervious to any evidence of its existence that might come to him at any time. He has no one but himself to blame if he is left in darkness.\" (Mystic Masonry, Buck, p. XXXVI.) The ritual and monitorial lessons of the Lodge teach nothing new, and the explanations of the sym- bols are often puerile and inadequate. Gen. Pike says, \"There is no sight under the sun more pitiful and ludicrous at once, than the spectacle of the Pres- tons and the Webbs, not to mention the later incar- nations of Dullness and Commoplace, undertaking to 'explain' the old symbols of Masonry, and adding to"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 185 and 'improving' them, or inventing new ones. To the Circle enclosing the central point, and itself traced be- tween two parallel lines, a figure purely Kabbalistic; these persons have added the super-imposed Bible, and even reared on that the ladder with three or nine rounds and then given a vapid interpretation of the whole, so profoundly absurd as actually to excite ad- miration.\" (Morals and Dogma, Pike, p. 105.) The exegesis is also often crude. This is not strange, as the ritual was written before the days of modern Biblical scholarship, and perhaps it would be well if the ritual were revised. These immature con- ceptions could be eliminated without affecting the meaning and beauty of the ceremonies. However, if we bear in mind that Masonry does not indorse its legends as literal facts, no harm can be done. We will now consider some of the symbols and myths of the Fraternity. THE LODGE. The Lodge represents King Solomon's Temple. The temple is a symbolic image of the universe, and as such is symbolic in all its parts and arrangements, therefore, the temple of Solomon resembles all the temples of antiquity that practiced the Mysteries. The Hebrews, like other peoples, made much of the system of numbers to convey their hidden meaning. The Holy of Holies formed a cube, corresponding to the number four, which represents manifested nature, while the three sides or faces of the figure, when drawn on a plane surface, represented the Deity, the three aspects of Will, Wisdom and Activity (Intelli- gence). Everything within the temple was symbolic-"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"185 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry ally arranged. The ceiling, supported by twelve col- umns, represented the twelve months of the year; the borders around the columns and the candlestick with the twelve lights represented the twelve signs of the zodiac ; the seven lights, the seven planets ; the veils of four colors represented the four elements, etc. In the Royal Arch Degree of the American Rite, the Tab- ernacle has four veils of different colors, to each of which belongs a banner and on each banner is in- scribed one of the four images ; the Bull, the Lion, the Man, the Eagle. These constellations answered to the equatorial and solstitial points of 2500 years B. C. The four signs Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius, were termed the fixed signs, and are as- signed to the four veils. The Sun entered Taurus at the vernal equinox, Leo at the Summer solstice, Scor- pio at the autumnal equinox (for which, on account of its malignant influence, Aquilla, the eagle was sub- stituted), and Aquarius at the winter solstice- Every temple was a representation of the universe, and in them the great lights of Nature played an im- portant part. The images, of the Sun, Moon, and Mercury were represented, and even in our Lodge rooms they constitute the three lights, except that for Mercury the Master of the Lodge has been substi- tuted. Eusebius tells us that the officers of the Eleu- sinian Mysteries were the Hierophant, representing the Great Architect of the Universe ; the torch-bearer, representing the Sun; the altar-bearer, representing the Moon; and the sacred herald, representing Mer- cury. The latter was charged with excluding the pro- fane from the Mysteries. Every Lodge, as we have said, represents the Tern-"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 187 pie. The two great columns between which you pass as you enter the Lodge represent the two great pil- lars, 30 feet 8 inches high; 6 feet 10 inches in diam- eter, which stood in the porch of the temple on either side of the Eastern gateway. These columns repre- sent the two pillars of Hercules, the solstices, Cap- ricorn and Cancer, the two gates of heaven, and were imitations by the Tyrian artist of the columns at the entrance of the temple of Malkarth in Tyre. The Lodge is said to be due east and west as King Solomon's Temple was so situated. All the temples of Antiquity were usually thus built. Pythagoras also arranged his assemblies due east and west because he held that motion began in the east and proceeded west. The Egyptian and Mexican Pyramids were also built to the four cardinal points of the compass, while be- neath the Temple, extending east and west, was a subterranean cavern used for Initiation. No well- equipped Lodge is lacking in this particular. THE FURNISHING OF THE LODGE. The Holy Bible, Square and Compasses, together with a Charter or Dispensation, constitute the furnish- ings of the Lodge. (i) The Holy Bible. This in a Christian Lodge consists of the Old and New Testaments; a Hebrew Lodge would use the Old Testament only; a Moham- medan Lodge, the Koran ; in like manner a Buddhist Lodge could use the Tripitaka, a Hindu Lodge the Vedas, etc. The obligation of the candidate is always taken on the Sacred Book of his religion, for his Holy Bible is his Light, in accordance with which he should live and walk."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"188 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry (2) The Square and Compasses. These symbols are perhaps the most familiar to the general public of any in Masonry. I need not dwell on the lessons in morality which the square and compasses teach. Ma- sonry is, however, something more than a system of morality, and it is this inner significance that I have endeavored to set forth. There is a science and philosophy concealed in these symbols which Dr. Buck explains as follows: \"The Square with its one right angle and its scale of meas- urements applies to surfaces and solids, and deals with the apparently fixed states of matter. It repre- sents solidarity, symmetry and proportion ; and this in- volves the sciences of arithmetic and geometry. The Compasses with moveable angle set in the Lodge at an angle of 60 degrees, applies to the circle and the sphere; to movements and revolutions. In a general sense, the square is a symbol of matter and the earth ; the Compasses of Spirit and the heavens.\" (Mystic Masonry, Buck, p. 242.) The position of the Square and Compasses indicates the progress of the candidate from Entered Appren- tice to that of Master Mason. THE ORNAMENTS. The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pave- ment, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is supposed to represent the ground floor of King Solomon's Temple ; the Indented Tessel, the border or skirting surrounding it. There is no evidence that either existed in the ancient tem- ple, but the symbol is significant as it denotes the checkered course of life, also the two opposing prin-"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 189 ciples in Nature, Light and Darkness, Michael and Satan, Balder and Loki, Ormuzd and Ahriman, etc. The Blazing Star also represents these two princi- ples. If the point is turned upward it represents God, Good, Order, or the Lamb of Ormuzd and St. John; if the point is turned downward it denotes Lucifer, Evil, Disorder, or the accursed Goat of Mendes and the Mysteries. The Blazing Star or Pentagram also represents the human body, the five points repre- senting the four limbs and head. It is thus called the sign of the Microcosm. All the Mysteries of Magic were said to be summed up in this symbol. Paracel- sus pronounces it the greatest and most potent of all signs. THE ALL SEEING EYE. This symbol, in the Ancient Mysteries, indicated the sight that annuls time and space. This is the symbol of the higher clairvoyance. The Master always pos- sessed this sight. In India this All Seeing Eye was called the Eye of Siva. The Egyptians represented Osiris by the symbol of an open eye, and placed this hieroglyphic of him in all their temples. In the Lodge the All Seeing Eye represents the Omniscence of God, The Eye that never sleeps. It may also represent, as in the Ancient Mysteries, the higher vison. THE LETTER G. This letter is the natural symbol among English- speaking people for God. It is a substitute in Ameri- can Lodges for the Hebrew Yod, which is the Kab- balistic symbol for unity. In France the letter Yod is put in the Blazing Star."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"190 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry THE CLASPED HANDS. This symbol was used by Pythagoras and repre- sented the sacred number ten the number expressed by the mysterious Tetractys. This figure was repre- sented in the form of the triangle. The Hebrews formed it with the letters of the Divine Name. Both Pythagoras and the Hebrew priests borrowed the fig- ure from the sacred science of Egypt. THE TRIANGLE AND DOUBLE TRIANGLE. All the nations of antiquity considered the triangle as sacred. It was one of the most common symbols for the Deity. The three sides typify the three as- pects of God Will, Wisdom and Intelligence. Here we have the Trinity in Unity. The double triangle interlaced, symbolizes the mani- fested universe the union of spirit and matter. The triangle pointing upward is spirit or fire ; the one point- ing downward is matter or water. One represents the descent of spirit into matter, the other the ascent of matter to spirit. The union of the two, in the manifested universe, is inseparable. This double tri- angle is used in India to symbolize two Hindu Gods, or rather the two aspects of Ishvara Siva and Vish- nu. It also represents the six points, the senary, which with the point in the center is the septinary. THE LIGHT. There are three greater and three lesser lights in Masonry, and though the ritual does not give any ex- planation of these symbols, there is an important meaning connected with them. The Sun is an ancient symbol of the Logos it signifies the male aspect, the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 191 life-giving and generative power. God is the source of light, and light is the cause of life. The Moon rep- resents the passive, or female aspect of Nature. JACOB'S LADDER. The mystical ladder which Jacob in his vision saw, extending from earth to heaven, was a common sym- bol in the Ancient Mysteries, and was always com- posed of seven steps or rounds. The ladder symbol- ized the progress of man from his present to higher conditions each round representing one of the seven stages of his evolutionary progress. In the Mysteries of Persia and India this mystic ladder was an impor- tant symbol, especially in the former, where a ladder of seven rounds was erected in each of their temples. The seven steps also correspond to the seven gates through which the candidate was passed successively in his journeyings through the seven caverns of Initi- ation, and symbolized the seven conditions or sub- planes of Hades. The seven steps, seven gates, seven halls, seven worlds, seven planes, etc., are all symbols of the various stages of the soul's progress. The ancient Initiates held that the evolution of the human soul took place through a series of seven globes situated on the three lower planes of the universe. The life wave passes seven times round this world- chain, and through seven stages on each globe. The progress involves a downward and an upward arc a descent of spirit into matter and a re-ascent of spirit to God. This is symbolized in Jacob's vision by the angels ascending and descending. Jacob's ladder is sometimes misrepresented with three or nine rounds; it should have seven. Dr. Mackey"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"192 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry says that \"The error arose from the ignorance of those inventors who first engraved the masonic symbols for our monitors. The ladder of Masonry, like the equi- pollent ladders of its kindred institutions, always had seven steps, although in modern times the three prin- cipal or upper ones are alone alluded to. These rounds, beginning at the lowest, are Temperance, For- titude, Prudence, Justice, Faith, Hope, and Charity.\" (The Symbolism of Freemasonry, Mackey, p. 120.) The application of these virtues, however, is a later addition to symbolism. The seven rounds are also emblematical of the seven planes of the universe physical, astral, mental buddhic, atmic, anupadika and adi; the seven ancient elements earth, water, fire, air, ether, and two un- named; the seven subplanes of the astral world astral solid, liquid, gaseous, etheric, super-etheric, sub- atomic, and atomic; the seven metals lead, quick- silver, copper, tin, iron, silver, and gold; the seven colors black, purple, green, blue, red, white, and yel- low; the seven stones diamond, amethyst, emerald, sapphire, ruby, pearl, and topaz; the seven ancient planets Saturn, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Luna and Sol. Thus the seven-stepped ladder had various applications and correspondences. Its presence in the Masonic institutions is evidence of the close analogy between Freemasonry and the Ancient Mysteries. THE RIGHT ANGLED TRIANGLE, OR THE 47TH PROBLEM OF EUCLID. This is one of the most important symbols of an- tiquity. The perpendicular line, whose measurement is 3, represents the active, male principle; the base"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 193 line, whose measurement is 4, represents the passive, female principle; and their union, or the addition of the squares of these numbers, will produce a square whose root will be the hypotheneuse, a line meas- ured by 5 and representing the universe. The square of the perpendicular and base, 9+16=25, the square root of which is 5, the number of the hypotheneuse. It was taught in all the Mysteries that the union of the male and female principles of Nature produced the universe. This is the occult meaning of the 47th problem of Euclid the sum of the squares of the per- pendicular and base of a right angle triangle equals the square of the hypotheneuse. This is a symbol of perfect proportion between number and forms; be- tween spirit and matter. The three sides of the triangle bear the proportions, as we have seen, of 3, 4, and 5, and $-}-=$*, or 9+16=25; also 9+16+25=50. Thus the number 50 is based on the proportion of the sides of the right angled triangle. Philo speaks of two series, which he calls triangles and squares; namely, i, 3, 6, 10 and i, 4, 9, 16. With regard to the triangle series i, 3, 6, 10, it is interest- ing to note that 1=1 ; 3=1+2; 6=1+2+3; and 10=1+2+3+4. In the square series, i, 4, 9, 16; i=i a ; 4=2 2 ; 9=3'; and 16=4' ; 1+3+6+10=20; and 1+4+9+16=30; and 20+30=50; 50 was a sa- cred number, and was derived from the right angled triangle. The greatest Jewish festival (Jubilee) took place every fifty years. THE LAMB-SKIN OR WHITE LEATHER APRON. In the Ancient Mysteries the investiture of the Apron formed an essential part of the ceremony of"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"194 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry Initiation. The Apron and White Robe were symbols of purity. In Persia the investiture was exceedingly imposing. The candidate having taken the oath of secrecy, was given the insignia of the Order the Girdle, the Tiara, the White Apron and the Purple Tunic. The Japanese candidate was also clothed in certain Garments which consisted of a Loose Tunic and White Apron bound round the loins with a girdle. In the degree of holiness practiced by the Pharisees the \"noviciate\" was also given an Apron as a symbol of purity. The Essenes and Druids invested their can- didates with a White Robe, and the Scandinavians gave the candidate a White Shield. In all these ceremonies whatever the material or form, the symbolic signifi- cance was always the same. The White Apron of Masonry was derived from these ancient ceremonies, and is one of the most significant symbols in our Or- der; the color \"White\" having been an emblem of Light and Purity from time immemorial. The shape and combination of the Masonic Apron is that of a triangle overlapping a square, represent- ing the occult septenary nature of man. The triangle symbolizes spirit, or the three highest principles; the square or quaternary the four lowest. Each prin- ciple is correlated to a plane, a round and a race. The spiritual triad is the spiritual body of St. Paul, and the quaternary the natural body. The triad, which is the immortal part of man, contains potentially all the powers of Divinity; and to develop these latent attri- butes it must descend into matter the triangle must incarnate in the square. This is represented in Masonry by the degree of Entered Apprentice, and is symbol- ized by the way in which the Apprentice is taught to"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 195 wear his Apron. The spiritual is subordinate to the material earthly desires and passions rule supreme. But the candidate is here to learn to subdue his pas- sions; his partial success is represented by the degree of Fellow Craft, and is symbolized by the way he wears his Apron in that degree. The complete tri- umph of the spiritual is represented by the Master Mason degree, and is again indicated by the Apron. This state was represented in the Ancient Mysteries by the mystical death and resurrection of the candi- date. The perfected Initiate has mastered his lower nature and has become the Perfect Man, Hermes, Buddha, or Christ. The symbolism of the Apron is indeed far reaching. Let every Mason remember how he impersonated the Grand Master. He should never forget its deep significance. In the Ancient Mysteries the candidate did not merely impersonate the Master, he himself became the Master the ceremony merely symboliz- ing what he became. It is a mistake to suppose, as some writers have, that the candidate m the mystic rites was merely representing the events connected with the tragedy of the Master or God from whom the Mysteres derived their name. The story of the Master or God was wholly an allegory of the experi- ences of the Initiate, while the rites were but typical of the various stages in the growth of the soul. In the process of becoming a Christ he represents all those who have attained the Christ state, for all mas- ters have passed through the experiences symbolized by the Myth.

In the Ancient Mysteries there was a further Rite which symbolized the next stage, that of union with the Divine, the At-One-Ment. This was the Ascen- sion, and is symbolized by the square enclosed in the triangle. The lower nature is here refined and \"as- cends to the Father.\" God is All in All. As we have already said, each principle in man's constitution is correlated to a plane. A knowledge of these planes would enable a man by a trained will to direct the forces on each plane. Such is the power of a real Master."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"LECTURE XI. THE SYMBOLS AND LEGENDS OF MASONRY (Continued.) In this concluding lecture of the series, we will consider the remaining important symbols and legends of Masonry. SACRED OR INEFFABLE NAME. This symbol was universal in ancient times, for every nation of antiquity had its Sacred Name or Ineffable Word. The Hebrew symbol consists of four letters, Yod, He, Van, He, and is called the Tetragrammaton, or four lettered word. This word was said to have been communicated by God to Moses at the burning bush. The name was held most sacred by the Jews, but its meaning and proper pronuncia- tion has long been obscured. Before the invention of the masoretic points the pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be known by the characters themselves, so it was easy in the course of time to lose the proper pronunciation. Especially so, as at the beginning of the Hellenistic age the use of the name was reserved for the temple. At the beginning of the Christian era, Philo writes, \"The four letters may be men- tioned or heard only by holy men whose ears and tongues are prepared by wisdom,, and by no others in any place whatsoever.\" In the course of time the"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"198 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry pronunciation of the name, even by the temple priests, fell into disuse, and the manner of its pronunciation at length became a secret entrusted only to the few. While the word was being withdrawn from common use, it was pronounced \"Adonai\" in the scriptures, and when the vowel points were introduced those that belonged to Adonai were placed under the Tetra- grammaton. The word itself is a symbol; the letters are prob- ably arranged as a blind. As they stand in the Tetra- grammaton they have no significance. They do not represent any real Hebrew word. Now if we apply the Hebrew method of halving or transposing letters which was used to conceal the meaning of a word, or rather if we reverse the process which may have been employed, we get instead of Y. H. V. H., H. V. H. Y. Before the introduction of vowel signs, certain weak consonants such as Yod and Vau, were sometimes used to indicate vowel sounds, so we frequently see I or E given as an equivalent for Yod, and U or O given for Vau. Even Yod is sometimes given as Jod, and Vau as Waw, so we have the name given as Y. H. V. H. or I. H. V. H. or J. H. V. H., or Y. H. W. H., or I. H. O. H., etc. Now the personal pronouns He and She are writ- ten in Hebrew with the signs He, Vau, A-leph, and He, Yod, A-leph. When A-leph terminates a word, and has no vowel immediately preceding or following, it is usually dropped. Now if we drop the final A-leph we have the transposed Tetragrammaton, H. V. H. Y., which are the personal pronouns He and She, the male and female, representing the two great"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 199 principles of nature, the dual aspect of the Second Logos. Now if we turn to the Kabbalah, which contains some portions of the secret teachings of the Jews, we shall find that this great principle is the exact meaning of the Tetragrammaton. It does not repre- sent the Absolute Deity, or the Unmanifested Logos, but it does represent the manifested, the first emana- tion Adam Kadmon. The two aspects of Being which are potential in the First Logos, become mani- fested in the later stages of evolution. This name represents the four worlds Alseluth, signified by Yod, Briah by He, Yezerah by Vau, and Asiah by the Second He. The source of the Tetragrammaton is Absolute Deity, Ain-Soph, the Causeless Cause. The Tetragrammaton is also the Sephiroth, which are ten in number, and emanate one from the other. The highest is Kether, the Crown; then comes Chockmah and Binah, the male and female principles. From these emanate the other seven. The very fact that the meaning of the Tetragrammaton is identical with the words obtained by transposing the letters, is suf- ficient evidence that the word was really H. V. (or W. U. O.) H. Y. (or J. I. E.), according to the equiva- lents adopted for the signs whether interpreted as consonants or vowels and the names given to the signs. The meaning and pronunciation of the word was carefully guarded. There is no hint given in the ritual for this secrecy, but there is a scientific reason, for the mystic Word has to do with the science of rhythmic vibrations which is the key to the equili- brium of all forces. In all mysticism the knowledge"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"200 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry of names meant the possession of powers. The spoken name gave one the power of the name. It is interesting to note how the Jews worked this idea into their system. In the Talmud the wonderful works of Jesus are ascribed to his use of the Sacred Name. According to early traditions the knowledge whereby he wrought these works was learned in Egypt, but in the developed Toldoth the \"word of power\" was the Holy Name, the Tetgrammaton. All nations of antiquity had their Sacred Names, which were \"Words of Power.\" These names were formed by taking a letter which conveyed a meaning and adding other letters each having a meaning; the whole word thus formed constituting a Sacred Name or Word, which contains some great truth. These Names were Words of Power, for, as the unfolding consciousness realizes one truth after another and be- comes that truth, it rules. In Persia the Sacred Name was H. O. M., in India A. U. M., in Scandinavia I. O. W., in Greece I. A. O., etc. THE RITE OF CIRCUMAMBULATION This Rite again connects Freemasonry with the An- cient Mysteries. It consists in a formal procession around the altar, and originally alluded to the appar- ent course of the sun which is from east to west. In ancient Greece the priests, during the Rites of sacri- fice, walked three times around the altar while chant- ing a sacred hymn, which was divided into three parts, and each part was to be sung at a particular point in the procession. The analogy between this practice of the ancients and the recitations of a pass- age of Scripture in the Masonic circumambulation^ is"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 201 quite apparent. In making this circuit it was con- sidered necessary that the right side should always be next to the altar, and so the procession moved from west to the north, then east, south, west and then to the north again. We find the same Rite among the Romans, Druids, and Hindus. In all these ceremo- nies they were \"imitating the example of the sun and following his beneficent course.\" THE LEGEND OF THE WINDING STAIRS. This Legend is connected with the Fellow Craft degree. It is based upon I Kings, vi, 8, \"The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house; and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.\" \"Out of this slender material,\" says Dr. Mackey, \"has been constructed an allegory, which, if properly considered in its symbolical relations, will be found to be of surpassing beauty. But it is only as a sym- bol that we can regard this whole tradition; for the historical facts and the architectural details alike for- bid us for a moment to suppose that the legend, as it is rehearsed in the second degree of Masonry, is any- thing more than a magnificent philosophical myth.\" (The Symbolism of Freemasonry, Mackey, p. 215.) The lesson which this legend teaches is not difficult to discover. Freemasonry is a speculative science which has for its object the investigation of divine truth. The candidate is in search of more light, and as all the ceremonies denote a progress from a lower to a higher state, he is always progressing. This fundamental symbolism of Masonry is found in each"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"202 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry degree. There is the mystical ladder, the ceremony of circumambulation, the restoration to life, etc. The Legend of the Winding Stairs symbolizes the same fact the ascent of man from ignorance to knowl- edge, from darkness to light, from death to life. The .steps of the Winding Stairs commenced on the porch of the Temple. This indicates the begin- ning of the masonic life the preparation for enter- ing the temple. It is curious to note that the number of steps in all the systems has been odd. This probably is due to the fact that the symbolism of numbers was bor- rowed from Pythagoras, in whose system of philoso- phy the odd numbers were regarded as sacred, though the number of steps has greatly varied. Tracing boards have been found in which only five steps are represented, and others which denote seven. At one time in England the number was thirty-eight, which was reduced to thirty-seven, and in this country the number has been reduced to fifteen. Perhaps five would be the more appropriate as the stairs only ex- tended to the middle chamber. The number seven, corresponding to the number of rounds in the mystic ladder, would indicate the attainment of perfection the Holy of Holies. We might say that the complete stairs are composed of seven steps, three carrying the candidate into the ground floor of the temple, two into the middle, and two into the inner sanctuary The general symbolism of the Legend is not affected by the number of steps, or the method of division. The candidate who succeeds in climbing the Wind- ing Stairs will receive his reward. What is the re- ward or wages of the Speculative Mason? Not sil-"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 203 ver nor gold, but Truth. Yet the whole of divine truth cannot be imparted to the Fellow Craft. The Middle Chamber, then, where he receives his wages, is symbolical of the Fellow Craft degree, and the wages are appropriate to the degree of his progress. To again quote Dr. Mackey, \"It is, then, as a sym- bol, and a symbol only, that we must study this beauti- ful legend of the Winding Stairs. If we attempt to adopt it as an historical fact, the absurdity of its details stares us in the face, and wise men will wonder at our credulity. Its inventors had no desire thus to impose upon our folly ; but offering it to us as a great philoso- phical myth, they did not for a moment suppose that we would pass over its sublime moral teachings to accept the allegory as an historical narrative, without meaning, and wholly irreconcilable with the records of Scripture, and opposed by all the principles of prob- ability. To suppose that eighty thousand craftsmen were weekly paid in the narrow precincts of the tem- ple chambers, is simply to suppose an absurdity.\" (Ibid, p. 226.) We must guard against the materialization of our allegories and symbols. Remember Masonry is a \"system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.\" To regard the myths as history is to miss the truth which the symbols were designed to teach. No intelligent Mason will fall into this error. THE HIRAM LEGEND AND THE MASTER'S DEGREE. The Hiram Legend and the Master's Degree are derived from the Mysteries. They are the latest ex- pression of the old Sun Myth and the Ancient Rite. Dr. Mackey, in speaking of the symbol of Hiram,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"204 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry says, \"It was evidently borrowed from the pagan Mysteries, where Bacchus, Adonis, Proserpina, and a host of other apotheosized beings play the same role that Hiram does in the Masonic Mysteries.\" (Ibid, p. 20.) I have given, various forms of these Legends the Osiris, Atys, Hu, Balder, and others. In each of them the Hero of the Myth dies or is deprived of life, is laid away in the tomb, and rises again from the grave. This ceremony was called the mystical death and resurrection. The legend represents the activity of the Logos in the cosmos, and the mystic life of the Initiate. The ancient legends and symbols always have a double meaning and sometimes more. The lectures on True Initiation set forth in detail the two aspects of the Sun Myth the mythic and the mystic. To the unin- itiated the cosmic or mythic aspect of the legend was the only one seen, thus the Rites were supposed by them merely to typify the death and resurrection of some Hero or Demi God, as Osiris, Mithra, Atys, A v donis, Tammuz, etc., and so the Sun was wor- shipped under these titles. Perhaps this was natural enough, for the visible Sun was a symbol not only of the Logos, the Spiritual Sun, but also of the Initiate. The yearly course of the Sun represented in one as- pect the mystic life of the Initiate. You will recall that in the Hindu Mysteries when the candidate reached the south in his circuits, he said, \"I copy the example of the Sun, and follow his beneficent course.\" This example was not merely ex- ternal. The Sun is a symbol of the Logos, and its yearly course typifies the work of the Logos, so that"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 205 the candidate, by representing the Sun and following his course, is really following the example of the Logos ; the Sun Myth typifying both the activity of the Logos and the mystic life of the Initiate. In the true Mysteries the Rites symbolized the va- rious stages of this mystic life. Complete mastery over the lower nature was typified by placing the candi- date in a trance and laying him away in a sepulcher for three days and nights. In the Pseudo Mysteries the aspirant was confined in a cell in his normal state, and kept there in fear and darkness that he might reflect on the seriousness of the step taken, and be better prepared to receive the mysterious truths be- queathed from the ancient days. This was the sym- bolical death, the deliverance from which was called the resurrection. While confined in his cell the search for the Hero was made and his body finally found. The Master Mason will here see the source of the Hiram Legend, and the Master's Degree. I am not permitted to say more, neither is it necessary for those who are qualified will understand. Mr. Singleton, 33rd degree, after describing the mystical death in the Ancient Mysteries, says, \"The Intelligent Mason will, from this, discover the origin of the Rites in the 3rd Degree of Symbolic Masonry and the 5th and 3ist Degrees, A. A. S. R. . . . The Mysteries, in all their forms, were funereal. They celebrated the mys- tical death and revivification of some individual by the use of emblems, symbols, and allegorical repre- sentations.\" (History of Freemasonry and Concord- ant Orders, p. 73.) Mr. Singleton is here in error in regard to the purpose of the Mysteries, if he means that they merely celebrated the mystical death and"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"206 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry resurrection of some one individual. The ceremonies of Initiation symbolized the progress of the human soul, and the mystical death and resurrection were experienced by every Initiate. Perhaps in the latter days of the Mysteries, when no true Initiation took place, the ceremonies may have been considered as symbolizing the experiences of some special individ-, ual, but such was not the case in the true Mysteries. We see thus that the story of Hirami is but a vari- ation of the ancient and universal legend, in which Osiris, Adonis, Dionysus, Balder, Hu, and many more have played the principal part. Some call Hiram a \"mythical symbol.\" This is true, but he is also a mystical symbol. Mythically Hiram is the Sun, a symbol of the Logos ; mystically he is the perfect In- itiate, the Grand Master. The myth was not intended to add to the facts of history, but, as De Witte points out, \"to illustrate a philosophical or religious truth.\" We must here utter a protest against the sectarian interpretation of the Master Mason's degree. It is true that the degree embraces the inner truths of Christianity, in common with all the mystic teaching. But the origin of the degree and all its symbols and legends were derived from the Ancient Mysteries, and to call the degree a Christian institution, as do Hutch- inson and Oliver, is erroneous. Dr. Mackey, in speaking of this tendency to Christianize Masonry, says, \"We find Christian Masonic writers indulging in it almost to an unwarrantable excess, and by the extent of their sectarian interpretations materially af- fecting the cosmopolitan character of the institution. This tendency to Christianization has, in some in- stances, been so universal, and 'has prevailed for so"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 207 long a period, that certain symbols and myths have been, in this way, so deeply and thoroughly imbued with the Christian element as to leave those who have not penetrated into the cause of this peculiarity, in doubt whether they should attribute to the symbol an ancient or a modern and Christian origin. . . It is in this way that Masonry has, by a sort of inevitable process (when we look to the religious sentiment of the interpreters), been Christianized. . . I do not object to the system when the interpretation is not strained. . . all that I contend for is, that such in- terpretations are modern, and that they do not belong to, although they may often be deduced from, the an- cient system.\" (The Symbolism of Freemasonry, Mackey, pp. 238, 246.) THE SPRIG OP ACACIA. In all the Ancient Mysteries there were sacred plants which were symbols of Initiation. The myrtle was used in the Mysteries of Greece, the areca in the Egyptian Mysteries, the mistletoe in the Druidical Mysteries, the lotus in the Indian Rites, the lettuce in the Mysteries of Adonis, etc. Masonry has borrowed this custom from the ancients and adopted the acacia, which was sacred among the Hebrews, as its mystic symbol. The acacia was a sacred tree which grew abund- antly in the vicinity of Jerusalem. The sanctuary of the tabernacle and the holy ark were constructed from this wood, and the tree ever afterwards was regarded as sacred. This symbol has several meanings, but for our pur- pose we need mention only the primary and original"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"208 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry meaning which is Initiation, and its use as a symbol of immortality and innocence. These are closely con- nected and must be considered together to get the full meaning of the symbol. In olden days Initiation was based upon innocence; that is, upon purity of life, and the Initiation brought a realization of immor- tality. THE RITE OF DISCALCEATION. This Rite refers to the act of uncovering the feet on approaching holy ground. It is a symbol of rever- ence, and was a common practice among all the na- tions of antiquity. The priests always offered sacri- fices with uncovered feet. Pythagoras, instructed his disciples to offer sacrifices and worship with their shoes off. The Mohammedans, when about to per- form their devotions, always leave their slippers at the door of the Mosque. The Druids practiced the same custom whenever they celebrated the sacred rites. The Peruvians also left their shoes on the porch when they entered the temple. Dr. Oliver tells us that \"The same usage prevailed equally in India, and the islands to the west of Europe; and even the American savages thought that uncovering the feet, while in the act of devotion, was a sublime method of paying honor to the Deity.\" (Signs and Symbols, Oliver, p. 153.) The Jewish lawgivers adopted this sign of rever- ence, and the symbolism has descended to us. The application of the symbol to the third degree is well known to every Mason."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 209 THE STONE OF FOUNDATION. This is the most important symbol of the Royal Arch degree. It must not be confounded with any of the other stone symbols, such as the corner-stone, the key-stone, or the cape-stone. In the first place we need to understand that the symbol is purely allegorical. To accept it in a literal sense will present, as Dr. Mackey says, \"Absurdities and puerilities which would not occur if the Stone of Foundation was received, as it really is, as a philo- sophical myth, conveying a most profound and beau- tiful symbolism. Read in this spirit, as all the legends of Masonry should be read, the mythical story of the Stone of Foundation becomes one of the most impor- tant and interesting of all the Masonic symbols.\" (The Symbolism of Freemasonry, p. 283.) We have not time to trace the legendary history of the Stone of Foundation probably more legends are connected with this stone than with any other Masonic symbol. The Masonic legends of the Stone of Foun- dation, like nearly all that are of Jewish origin, are derived from the Jewish Talmud, and owe their ori- gin to the imaginative genius of the Talmudic writ- ers. But there is this difference between Talmudists and Masons. The former accept all these traditions, with their puerilities, anachronisms, and absurdities, as historical, while the intelligent Mason receives them as allegories. It would be interesting, did space permit, to give in full these Rabbinical reveries, and also the Masonic traditions based upon them. But I can only outline the tradition."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"210 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry The Talmudic legends tell us that Enoch built a subterranean temple on Mount Moriah, consisting of nine vaults situated beneath each other and communi- cating by apertures left in each vault. In the lowest arch he deposited a cubical stone, called afterwards the Stone of Foundation, on which had been inscribed the ineffable name of God. He then made a door of stone, with a ring in it, and placed it over the opening of the uppermost arch, and covered it so that it could not be seen. In the destruction of the world by the deluge all trace of the subterranean temple was lost, but when David was digging for the founda- tion of the Temple, he discovered, in the low- est depths of the excavation, a certain stone on which the name of God was inscribed. This stone he re- moved and deposited in the Holy of Holies. It was a favorite theory of the Talmud legend makers that David laid the foundation upon which Solomon built the temple. The Masonic tradition is substan- tially the same as the Rabbinical, except that it sub- stitutes Solomon for David as the discoverer of the stone, and makes him deposit it in the crypt of the temple, where it remained until the foundation of the second temple was laid, when it was discovered and placed in the Holy of Holies. These legends, in the light of historical narratives, would be, as Lee says, \"so many idle and absurd con- ceits,\" as facts, but as allegories they contain an im- portant symbolism. The symbolism and worship of stones in ancient times wa.s almost universal. The Greeks originally used unhewn stones of a cubical form to represent their Gods. These consecrated stones were placed"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 211 before the doors of the houses in Athens, also in front of the temples, in the schools and libraries, and at the corners of the streets. The Thebans worshiped Bacchus under the form of a square stone: Arnobius says that Cybele was repre- sented by a small stone of black color, and Eusebius cites Porphyry as saying that the ancients represented the Deity by a black stone because his nature was ob- scure, and inscrutable. The Mohammedans also have a black stone, which was formerly worshiped and is still much reverenced by Musselmen. The Druids represented their Gods by cubical stones, and we also find that the early American races worshiped square stones. These citations are taken from Mackey's \"Symbolism of Freemasonry.\" They might easily be extended, but those given will suffice to show that everywhere in the ancient world cubical stones were used as a symbol of the Deity. These mystical stones were all symbolic, and the le- gends connected with them allegories. The Masonic Stone and legend are no exceptions; the Stone of Foundation is but a symbol of the Deity. THE LOST WORD. The symbol of the Lost Word and the legend of the search for it, embodies the whole design of Free- masonry. The primary object of Freemasonry is the search after Divine Truth. The Word is a symbol of this Divine Truth, and this truth) is the key to the \"Science of the Soul.\" The real Master, then, is one learned in the Divine Science a \"Moses\" to lead the neophyte through a wilderness of experience, from his ignorant self to a knowledge of his true Self, a conscious union with God."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"212 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry The symbolism of the Lost Word may be applied to the degradation of the Ancient Mysteries which resulted in the loss of the real Word the knowledge of occult science. From that time to this, men have ever been in search of the real Word, and although but few have been able to regain the knowledge of the true Mysteries, others have often caught glimpses of the inner meaning, which is symbolized by the Substituted Word. That the symbolism is not well understood is evident from the fact that but few Ma- sons, if any, to-day possess the knowledge and power implied in the symbols and legends of the Order; for this reason only \"The Substitute\" monitorial expla- nation \"is given to the neophyte until he, perhaps in future generations, shall find the True Word.\" That Masonry was in search of the meaning of this symbolic Word, is clearly proven by the insight of the Revisionists in 1717, and the fact that Symbolic Ma- sonry did not pretend to give the candidate the Lost Word. They knew that the Word was no mere name, but a knowledge of occult science which could only be attained by soul development. Real Mastership must again be realized before the Lost Word can be found, and such realization must of necessity be the experience of each individual brother by whom it is found. The use made of the tradition of the recovery of the Lost Word, and its impartation in the Royal Arch degree, shows that the later degree makers little realized the meaning of the symbolism. They mis- took the symbol for the thing symbolized. The Royal Arch degree can only give the symbol. The real Word, which holds the inner meaning and the"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The Symbols and Legends of Masonry 213 power of the symbol, is still a mystery. To under- stand this mystic symbol, and all that it implies, is to possess the key to the science of sciences the real Knowledge or Word of Power. CONCLUSION. We will now bring this series of lectures to a close. We have seen that Masonry is modeled on the An- cient Mysteries, and derives its important symbols and legends from that source. Is this a mere coinci- dence? Was there meant to be only a similarity in outward form? We cannot so believe; the analogy is far too close. The men who formulated the ritual very well knew what they were doing. We believe that the secret vaults contain jewels not yet discov- ered, and it should be the work of every true Mason to search diligently for \"More Light.\" To discover the full meaning of the glyphs and allegories is to revive the Ancient Wisdom, the Secret Doctrine of An- tiquity, the real Lost Word. That such Wisdom once existed will not be denied by any intelligent Ma- son, for the whole superstructure of the Order is based upon the traditions of its existence. Dr. Buck says, \"Instead of being an imitation of the Mysteries of Antiquity, Masonry should become their Restora- tion and Perpetuation through the coming centuries, not by relaxing its discipline, or changing its ritual, but by deepening the learning, intensifying the zeal and elevating the aim of every Brother throughout the world.\" (Mystic Masonry, Buck, p. 79.) We have seen that the Masters of old were true Occultists Masters of Divine Science. Masonry has preserved for us the names that indicate the reality of"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"214 Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry occult knowledge and power in the Perfect and Sub- lime Master, Prince Adept, Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret, etc. If these names do not imply what I have suggested they are a mere farce and should be abolished. That they are empty titles to-day all will agree ; many having recognized this fact, are calling for their abolition. But I hold that instead of abol- ishing the titles we should endeavor to make them stand, in fact, for what in name they indicate. This would be in line with the ancient tradition a recov- ery of the real Lost Word, the key to the Science of Knowledge. Every Mason should labor assiduously for the realization of this ideal. Let us not be con- tent with the mere rudiments of our philosophy. \"That skill,\" says Dr. Mackey, \"which consists in repeating with fluency and precision, the ordinary lectures, in complying with all the ceremonial requisitions of the ritual, or the giving, with sufficient accuracy, the ap- pointed modes of recognition, pertains only to the very rudiments of the masonic science.\" (Symbolism of Freemasonry, p. 310.) There are many to-day who are not satisfied with these preliminary acquirements, and the cry for \"More Light\" is being heard in every quarter of the Masonic world. Intelligent Masons are beginning to realize that there is something more in our symbols and legends, and they are seeking their inner and ultimate meaning. Let us aid in this work by making our Lodges schools, our labor study, our wages learning, thus may we attain that knowledge of Divine Truth which shall truly make us Master Masons.

I looked again, deeper, and found the remedy I found one Law, the Law of Love; one Life, the Life of adjust- ment to that Law ; one Truth, the Truth of a conquered mind and a quiet and obedient heart. And I dreamed of writing a book which should help men and women, rich or poor, learned or un- learned, worldly or unworldly, to find within themselves the source of all success, all happiness, all accomplishment, all truth: And the dream remained with me, and at last became substantial, and now I send it forth into the world on its mission of healing and blessedness, knowing that it cannot fail to reach the homes and hearts of those who are waiting and ready to receive it\" As a Man Thinketh.
