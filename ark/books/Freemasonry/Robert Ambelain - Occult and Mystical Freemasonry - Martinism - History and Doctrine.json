Martinism has been in existenc e in its pr esent form for over one hundred yea rs, and there is an abundance of source ma teri al, commentaries and modern exegeses available in French, but r egrettably little had been translated into English for the benefit of the many anglophones who desperately seek information about this mystical current. Robert Ambelain was a singular force in the preservation and popularization of the Martinist and Elus Cohen Orders, and this book is interesting in both a historical and ritualistic sense, bein g written during the later years of World War II, when all esoteric societies in France were proscribed. The reader should note that this book was publis hed in 1944, and therefore should realiz e that later research has show n some of the assertions to be outdated or incorrect. The reader should take this fo r what it is, a seminal work on Martinism while remembering its history and the resources available to the author at the time. I have tried to translate (convey t he meaning) rather than transliterate (simply translate the words) as best I could. Any er ror s in interpretation are mine alone. Finally I would lik e to thank my mentors and those who read versions of this documents for their interest and thei r help. These included Michael Buck ley, Gilbert Tappa, Phillip Garvin, Ronald & Mary Cappello, Ronald Blaisdell, Elias Ibrahim and Jason Sheridan.

Vaughan (200 2) AUTHOR’S NOTES In other works, appearing before or afte r the war, we have often presented esoteric doctrines, each di fferent from the other. Each time, we published t hem with impartialit y and care for precision. We have even taken so much care, that we sometimes appear to be promoting these doctrines. Although to us these merited being ascribed very diverse labels, we were at the mercy of certain readers! And so, since the appearanc e of our book on the symbolism of Cathedrals, we have be en authoritatively link ed to one of the most redoubtable satanic sects! Nobody seems to know the sect’s name and chiefs exac tly, but it must be of the bla ckest magic. With our studies on Gnosis and the Ophites, we became fanatical Luc iferans; however, critics did us the favor of not overburdening us wit h the epithet (however flatteri ng) of Rose-Croix, despite the last chapter which explained their doctrine. Truly, our vanity has been agreeably gratified! Now we ar e publis hing a study of Martinism. No doubt people will attribute to us the spirit ual heritage of Martinez de Pasqually, not forgetting to enthusiastically describe the mystical ce remonies by which we try, in our perverse pride, to bring Evil powers under subjection to our empire, to evoke the celestial Intelligences and to converse wit h them, indeed in sa crilegious defiance, to attempt to summ on, that which Martinez de Pa squa lly and his disciple Louis- Claude de Saint-Martin called “the Repairer”. The fanatical adversaries of occult secret societies will a scribe dark and shadowy in tentions to us, and, for su re, will place us among the mysterious cohort of the “Unknown Super iors ”! They will ask us whence we ha ve obtaine d our abundant documentation, and by what miracle we even know the facts and deeds of a multi-secular society, existi ng at a time when, vigorously proscribed and persec uted, its members had to in crease both prudence and precaution. We reply to our ill-inte ntioned cr itics, to our declared an d hidden adversaries, that all this adds little of val ue to this book. It is of little importance that we have had access to archives wh ich have evaded them, that we have been written about in such purpo seful terms, or that we of right have had access to a realm where the doors have remained firmly closed to them . It concerns no- one but us. We are bringing the public a work which we wish to be historical and to cover th e doctrine. That is th e only thing on which we put any value 2 . 2 Also, on pag e 188 of our boo k “In the Shado w of the Cathe drals” ( Dan s l’Ombre de s Cathé drales) we wrote on t he su bje ct of the legen dary mediæval Sabbat: “the bla ck m ass cele brate d on the back or t he belly of a naked woma n also had esoteric signifi cance.

Snow covered the streets of P aris. On this Friday, when the pale sun declined and di ed upon the red horizon, men were assembled in a room on the top fl oor of a building in the Latin Quarter. It was an old 18 th Century house, with a la rge, monumental wooden st aircase. Outside in the streets, the squares, the cafés, ev erywhere, were the victorious German army. Everywhere als o were the agents of the Vichy Government. Police terror prevailed over Secret Soci eties and the Illuminati. Searches, seizures, arrests rained down upon those outside the law. But here, it was another world... On a table, covered with a triple cl oth of black, white and red, emblem of the Three Worlds, a sword with crucif orm guard sheds its gleam across the Gospel of St. John. Behi nd, in the dancing brightness of three tall candles lit and placed in a triangle, dimly veiled by t he odiferous smoke, appears the imprecise silhouette of the Initiator. With the censer in his hands he traces the mysteri ous Sign in a large and certain gesture. At one side, alone, burns another c andle. Leaning against the base of he candlestick is a cordelier and a mask. The candle of the “Past Masters”... In the silence, the Assistants standing silent and in meditation, the solemn voice continues the ritual profession, and the words of the Sacramentary sound, clear and sharp, invoking like a lit any. Through Time and Space they establis h a “bridge” which united the Living and the D ead. And suddenly it seems as though the room is peopled with Invisible Presences. 3 From the Lat in “pa rticul arius”: sm all pl ace. - 6 - "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"R.

May these Fl ames through their living Clarity illuminate the Brother s brought together at Your ca ll! May their presence constantly be a living testim ony of their Union...” With minute precision the initiatic Ce remony unfolds, full of grandeur. Time itself seems to have stopped. Now one of the assistants finally places the emblematic Mask, an i mage of Silence and Secrecy, upon t he face of the R ecipient. Another covers him with the great Mantle, symbol of Prudence. A th ird ties the Cordelier around his waist, recalling the “chain of Fraternity”. The slow theurgic office continues .. And after the consecration of a new Brother, the conferral of the esoteric “name”, the final words sound forth, and the ceremony reaches its end: “May you, my Brother, justify the words of th e Zohar: “Those who are possessed of the Divine Knowledge, shine with all the splendor of Heaven... But those who teach it to manki nd, according to the Ways of Justice, shine with the Stars for all Eternity!...” The Initiator and the Initiated now turn towards the solitary candle, towards the unmoving flame of the “Past Masters”. “My Brothers, I presen t to you N, “Unknown S uperior” of our Order, and pray you to accept him amongst us...” An extraor dinary anguish grips the heart of the assistants.

It is still snowing, and the air bec omes more chilly. In the streets, the squares, the victorious German army is everywhere. Everywhere also is suspicion and surveillance, inquiry and inve stigation, investi gation and seizure, seizure and arrest. Hostages fall, s hot, by the hundreds, in retaliation for anonymous violations . In only a few months the first convoys will depart for the concentration camps and forced work on the Eastern front. The ‘ Ost’ from whence nobody returns... And, like the bloody time s of the Middle Ages, terror reigns over the Illuminated ones. To begin with they attacked the Masons, Free-thinkers and Atheist s, who were simply engaged in pure wis dom. Then the spiritualist groups ; and finally the quasi-Masonic organizations . This was to win over public opinion. Now the secular battle, thwarted by seventy years of li beral ideo logy, is once more taken up. For behind Freemasonry and its offshoot s, are other things to discover! Things which one wis hes to fight, to fight to the death: Heresy, the eternal enemy! And behind this Heresy, its secula r animator: Occultism! Finally, we utter the great shameful word! One doesn’t shout it from the rooft ops, at least, not immediately! But above all, it is its archives, manuscripts, doctrinal or historical essays which will be in the limelight during the sear ch for this so-called Heresy. But in vain!

HISTORY & ORIGINS MARTINE Z DE PAS QUALLY & THE “KNI GHT-ELECT COHENS OF THE UNIVERSE” “Among the various Rites which, fr om time i mmemorial, have interested those Masons who are the best educated and the most imbued with the intimate conviction that their adherence to our Wo rks must increase the sum of their knowledge, and bring them to the High-Sc iences, the Rite of the “ Elus-Cohen ” is the one which has won over the most pupils, yet carefully preserved the secret of its mysterio us works....” Such is the definition given by the Or der of Illuminist Masonry, which we found in the Transactions of the Grand Orient for 1804, Book I, Installment 4, page 369. This statement of apprecia tion, coming from a masonic obedienc e which nev er exactly passed for mystic al, which later came to expunge the invocations to the Great Architect of the Univ erse from its Rituals, and slid insens ibly from eclectic philoso ph y into simple politics, has a particular value. Also, one of the most erudite and impartial historians who concerned himself with mystical masonic Obediences, Gérard Van Rijnberk, tells us that: “one cannot deny that the Order of Elus-Cohen constituted a group of men animated by the highest spirituality...” 4 Another his torian, M. Le Forestier, a very valuable spec ialist concerning matters of occult high masonry, says broadly the same thing, strongly emphasizing the purely altruistic and disint erested character of this Fraternity, more occult and mysti cal besides , than masonry in the gener al sense of the word. 5 This is why , of all the many “O rders” of illu minated masonry born in France and Europe during the restless current of the XVIII th Century, none have had an influence comparable to that whic h entered into History under the common name – and incorrect besides – of Martinism . Its appearance coincided with that of a strange person called Martinez de Pasqually. Even now the mo st romantic hypotheses are circulating about his name and his origins. Some say he is from an oriental race (Syrian), and others pretend he is a Jew (from Poland) .

These are: 1) \t The Master’s Act of Marriage to demoiselle Marguerite-Angélique de Colas; 2) \t The Certificate of Catholic ism, dated 29 th April, 1772, registered before his departure for Saint-Dominique on the “Duc de Duras”. From these two documents, publis hed by Madame René de Brimont, which were discovered by someone in the archiv es of the Department of Gironde, we can see that this man was named very precisely: Jacques de Livron de la Tour de la Case Martines de Pascally. He was the son of “ Messire de la Tour de la Case ”, born in Alicante (Spain) in 1671, and of demoiselle Suzanne Dum as de Rainau . He was born in Grenoble in 1727, and he died in St. Domingo, Tuesday, the 20 th September, 1774. The Signatu re of Martine s (Photog rap h from a m anuscript ) None of the preceding patronyms give s us any indic ation to suppose that he was Jewish. No more that the fact t hat he also liv ed for a specific period of his life in Bordeaux in “Jewis h Road”! For if l iving by a ghetto could be proof of religion (and how, logically?), then how can one accept that in Paris, he lived with the Augustinians by the River Seine, without claiming that influence? Some have put forward the theory t hat perhaps he came from a Jewish background, and was a converted Jew.

Martinez de Pasqually spent his life teaching French masons of regular obediences (which had strayed fro m the corre ct philosophical systems), and under the exterior guise of a normal Masonic Ritual , a true initiatic teaching, capable of assuming aspects of theodi cy, cosmogony, gnosis and philos ophy. In order to have certain concepts already half-formed in a specific intellectual and material discipline, he only accepted regular Masons into his Order, at the grade of “Mas ter” (Third Degree). But in addit ion, since it was a fact that important components could also learned through the channel of “profane” life, he establis hed at the base of his system a ‘p otted’ prior transmission of the three ordinary masonic degrees (known as blue , or St. John Masonry). In fact, one may understand this by the following: the secret reason for this earlier affiliation to masonic mastership resided in the fact that his school was based upon the same legend, or myth, as Freemasonry. Of the Hiram legend, presented without commentary or allusion to its esotericis m , Martinez de Pasqually gave a transcendent al explanation, a fram ework for his theogonic system. But he gave the esoteric allusi on in the higher Classes of the Order, leaving the legendary present ation – common to all masonic obediences – to the first three degrees. * * * Martinez de Pasqually traveled myst eriously in one part of France, principally the South-East and the Sout h. Leaving one town without saying where he was going, he would arrive in the same manner, wit hout a glimpse of where he had come from. Most probably he began his mission in 1758, since in his letter dated 2 nd September, 1768, he declares that the Brethren of Aubenton, commissioned - 12 - "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"R.

Propagating his doctrine , he welcomed adherents in the Lodges of Marseilles, Avigno n, Montpellier, Narbonne, Foix and Toulous e. Yet before commencing his mystical apostolate, he had definitely b een masonically active previously. His father, Don Martinez de Pascally, was holder of a masonic pa tent in English, delivered to him on 30 th May, 1738, by the Grand Master of the Stuart Lodge, with power to transmit it to his eldes t son, allowing him “as Grand Master, to constitute and run Lodges and Te mples to the Glory of the G ∴ A ∴ O ∴ T ∴ U ∴ ”. So it was that Martinez was also t he founder in Montpellier, in 1754, of the Chapter “Les Juges Ecossaise”. In 1755 until 1760, he traveled throughout France, rec ruiting followers. In this last year he failed in Toulous e, in the blue Lodges called “Reunit ed St. John”. At Foix, the Lodge “Joshua” gave him a sympathetic hearing. Ther e he initiated a number of masons, and founded a Chapter: the “Temple Cohen”. In 1761, presented by the Compte de Maillia l d’Alz ac, the Marquis de Lescourt, the two Brothers from Aubenton ( and thanks to his famil ial patent), he was affiliat ed with the Lodge “La Française” of Bordeaux. There he built wh at he called his “Particular Temple” (from the Latin particular: part, cell, reduction). Among its members, i n addition to the f our mentioned above, were Messieurs de Casen, de Bobié, Jules Tafar (ex-major of the “Royal Grena diers”), Morrie and Lescombard. This Lodge bore the name of “La Perfection Elue Ec ossaise”. In 1784, this Cohen “Mother Lodge” became “L a Français e Elue Ecossaise”. In March, 1766, the aforement ioned Lodge was dissolv ed. Note that, until this date, Martinez had Father Bullet as his secret ary, almoner for the Regiment at Foi x, who has the title (employed by the Master for the first ti me) of “S.I.”. We suggest – with some chance of being correct – that it was the sacerdotal character of Father Bullet which afforded him this interior title, of Supérieur Inconnu of the Order, or possibly – if we r ead the ‘I’ as a ‘J’ – of : Sovereign Judge ”. Martinez de Pasqually must have given him this title as the theologian of t he Order! But later on, before his departure for St . Domingo, he gave this title to five of his senior dignitaries.

But it wasn’t until 1 st February, 1765, that t he Grand Lodge of France, after numerous letters, issued a patent authorizing the founding of this Lodge, and inscribed the “Temple” in its record books. This same year, Martinez de Pas qually left for Paris. He stayed there at the house of the Augustinians by the side of the River Seine. There, he put himself in touch with numerous eminent masons: Brothers Bacon de La Cheva lerie, de Lusign an, de Loos, de Grai nville, J.B. Willermoz, and many others, to whom he sent hi s first instructions. Wi th their meeting, on 21 st Marc h, 1787, (the Spring Equinox...), he put together the basis of his “Sovereign Tribunal”, and named Bacon de la Chevalerie his substitute. In 1770, the Order of Knight-Elus Cohen of the Univers e had Temples spread far and wide: Bor deaux, Montpellier, Avignon, Foix, Libourne, La Rochelle, Versailles, Pari s, Metz. Another was opened in Lyon, thanks to the activities of Brother J.B. Willermoz, and this city would remain the symbolic “capital” of the Order fo r a long time afterwards.

According to this approach, one must take the nomenclat ure of the Order of Elus-C ohen (“Grand-Architect”, “Grand-Elect of Zerubbabe l”) as regulated by this hermeti c practice. We will simp ly point out that the name Zerubbabel is that of t he archi tect who, like Hiram, rebuilt the Temple of Jerusalem after the captiv ity. The snares and threats of the neighboring, idolatrous nations put Zer ubbabel (so the biblical legend tells us ) under the need to perform his works with “a trowel in one hand. A sword in the other”. One sees there the esoteric parallel establis hed by Martinez de Pasqually, between the Companions of the Second Temple and the mystical masons of his Order, building the Celestial City, re consti tuting the initial Archetype and, theurgic sword in hand, doing battle against the Entities of the Shadows. In a similar manner, Zerubbabel signif ies in H ebr ew: “Adversary of Confusion”.

(According to the Bible, Babel signifies: “confusion”). * * * The regular symbolic grades (Apprentice, Companion, Master) belong to traditional Masonry. They were des tined to give the necessary quality of Master to the Profane entrant into the Or der, required by the Rule to be able to attain the grade and functions of Réau-Croix . In the rituals and Catechism s, very few allus ions were made to the secret Doctrine which had been promised, and which did not form part of the usual framework of contemporary Freemasonry. This allo wed “visiting Brethren” from other obediences to be recei ved, who at this time, didn’t go above the grade of Master, the only grade recognized by the Grand Lodge of France (the Higher Grades came later). Thus, such visitors couldn ’t later report any specific teachings learned in the Cohen Temples to the Grand Lodge, which had recognized and adopted them on the 1 st of February, 1765! The Porch Degrees (Apprentice-Cohen, Co mpanion-Cohen, Master- Cohen), continued to maintain the external masonic character. Nevertheless , they were shot through with allus ions , expressions, teachings, enigmas and ambiguities , destined to give a glimpse of the secret Doctrine – early and by flashes – reserved for the superior Degrees. From the Tem ple Degrees , we can say that they constitute what is proper to call the “High Grades”. The rituals of “Grand-Architect” and “Grand-Elect of Zerubbabe l” still retain the emblems of masonic symbolism (aprons, collars, jewels, the ritual forma t itself, etc ...). But th eir Catechisms transport the Candidate into overt esoteric mysticism, and more particularly into that of the general Doctrine. At the grade of “Grand- Architect”, the Brother was required to purify himself through a specific ascetic regi men of the Order (abstinence from certain meats, from cert ain sanctioned animal parts, fa ts, etc...in the spirit of the Old Testament – the regimen of the Levites – ). It was their mission to expel the Powers of Darkness which had inv aded the terrestrial aura, by means of magical cer emonies performed in groups as well as alone; and to cooperate “sympathetically” – in a specific manner – in those special Operations performed by t he “Sovereign Master” himself. This Grade was equivalent to Apprentic e Réau-Cr oix (t his was the role devolved to the “Knights of the East” defined in the archives gathered by Papus). The following Grade, “Grand-Elect of Zerubbabel” (or “C ommander of the East”), was equivalent to “Companion Réau-Croix”. Like all Companion grades in the various masonic “regime s”, it was both neutral and ambiguous , - 16 - "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) poorly defined yet full of mystery and enigm a in the ritual. It was a Grade which in Cohen series was based upon the legend of Zerubbabel, explained at a higher level. It concerned itse lf with a mysterious and emblematic bridge , analogous to that erected over the River Cephisus, and which the initiates on their return from Eleusis had to cross 7 . In this Degree the affiliate had a respit e from the ceremonia l “Operations”. He meditated for a period of time, re turned to the fundamental theories, and prepared himself, through a form of intr ospection (a thorough accumulation, or psychic retrenchment) to his fu ture ordination of Réau-Croix. The “ Secret Class ” was that of the Réaux-Cr oix. According to all the historiographers of the Order, it only comprised a si ngle Degree. Yet some abridged c omments w e have come across i n the letters of Claude de Saint- Martin, duri ng the time that he was secretary to the Master (in place of P. Bullet, who had disappeared), we are led to believe that that this C lass comprised two Degrees. There is, in fact, a Degree abr idged to two letters: G. R., which Saint-Martin re fers to in some letters 8 . And this makes us wonder if behind the secret grade of Réau-Croix there perhaps exis ted an even more secret one called “Grand R éau-Croix” or “Grand-Réau” (G.R.). The purpos e of this class, through it s esoteric teachings, was to place the dignitaries in communion with the worlds of the Beyond, thos e of the Celestial Powers, and this by means of the Evocations of High Magic. Whereas the grade of “Grand-Architect” taught how to chase Demoni acal Powers from the Earth’s aura by means of magical exorcisms , the grade of ” Réau-Croix taught the means of evoking Celestial Powers and attracting them “sympathetically” to this same terrestrial aura. Mor eover, by their apparent manifestations (auditory or visual), they allow ed the Réau-Croix to judge the degree of progress which the evoker had achi eved, and to see if he had been ”reintegrated into his original powers” , according to the Master’s phrase. So it is wrong to put out a general opinion that the Theur gy of the Elus Cohen was simply about magical ceremonial Exorcism. It also embraced the realm of Evocation, but for a purely di sinterested end, and with respect for the Beings of living light at the breast of the “spiri tual regions” of the Beyond. This leaves the probable grade of “Grand Réau-Croix”. We will no w put forward a hypothesis which shouldn’t be re jected out of hand. From historical documents published by G.

We will ma ke a final comment on t he grade of “Select Master” or “Grand- Elect”, placed in the both series between the Porch Class and the ordinary grades.

Even better, he is made to live out – in a kind of symbolic play, or ”My stery”, in the medi eval sense of the word – the symbolic putting to death of the aforementioned traitors. This apparently motiveless ritual had the ex press role of magnetically and psychically “recharging” the Egreg ore of the Obedience, that occult and invis ible soul whic h tru ly animates and vivifies, even reacting automatically , and without which it would be necessary to perform the ceremony against false Companions onc e more. This explains why traitors, bad Br others, perjurers of Obligations, occasionally the adversaries of Freemasonry, have all ended tragic ally, even without direct human intervention! Bound in advance to this fate, by a very clear Obligation, having fr eely consented to the fate which attends them if they betray it, they are, fo r this reason, exposed to the vengeful forces of the Egregore. And if by thei r behavior they expose themselves to that inexorable law, they automatically trigger the return blow of vengeance and chastisement. * * * - 18 - "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) There remains another Degree, poorly defined, but no less proven historically. It is that of “Unknown Superior” or “Sovereign Judge”. This was the title of five dignitaries of the Order, all of them “Réaux-Croix”. According to Prince Christian of Hesse, (cited by G. Van Rijnberk in his work on Martinez de Pasqually), in his letter to the “Grand-Profès” of the Templar Rite of Strict Observance, Metz ler, Senator of Frankfurt -on-the-Main, these five were: Bacon de la Che valerie, J.-B. Willer moz , de Serre (or Deserre), du Roy d’Hauterive , and de Lusignan . People hav e objected that relations between Bacon de la Chevalerie and Martinez were more than strained at this time, and suggest it would be unlik ely that he would have been designa ted by the Master to be seated among the senior occultists to whom he entrusted his work. However, this forgets that Martinez de Pasqually was ve ry fastidious in all things to do with ritual, regularity, and the ma terial forms of transmission . He was definitely not a simplifier, like Louis- Claude de Sain t-Martin, but a person who guarded ritual “legitimacy”, as did Willermoz. The different ways in which they applied the same doctrine demonstrates this fact. And it is plausible to entertain the idea that Bacon de la Chevalerie, who was the first Elu-Cohen to fulfill the charge of “Substitute” to the Grand Master would not, by virtue of this fact, have been exc luded fro the “Sovereign Tribu nal: constituted by the five “S.J.” or “S.I.” (the ‘ i ’ and ‘ j ’ were substitutable letters at that time). Also, Bacon de al Chevaler ie had been a part of the fi rst “Sovereign Tribunal” (as Substitute) founded in 1765 in Par is, during the stay of Martinez de Pasqually in the capital. * * * This last task completed, in the mont h of May, 1772, the Master embarked for Saint-Dominique, on the ship “The Duke of Duras”. It is during this time that he had to have his famous Certificate of Catholic ism issued. The ship left from Bordeaux, his place of residence, and this Certificate of Catholic ism was in support of the baptism of his son, ( baptized in the church of Sainte-Croix, on the 24 th of June, 1768, St. John’s Day) to show that Martinez de Pasqually certainly wasn’t Jewis h! Still, he cert ainly wasn’t a very orthodox Catholic either! Like all occultists, like all those in itiat ed in the esoteric traditions, in the eyes of the Roman Church Martinez was officially a heretic. But he is incontestably a Christian, for he p laces the Christ (the “Repa irer”), at the heart of his whole doctrine. He is also a Kabba list , as he envisages the Messiah in the manner of the es otericists of this mystical school. A good Catholic? No...externally! Christian? Certainly. His first secretary was Father Bullet, almoner of the Regiment at Foix; and one of his first disciples was the Abbé Fournier. But above all, he was a prodigious man, with both faults and virtues, like all men.

But at the Master ’s death, the “T ∴ P ∴ M ∴ ” ( Thrice Potent Master ) 10 was unable to become actively involved in the Order, not only with the Cohen “Temples” of Po rt-au-Prince and Léogane, but least of all with those in Eur ope. Schism s followed, inevitable in all hum an endeavors. When he dies in his turn in 1778 (four years after Martinez), he had transmitted his powers to “T ∴ P ∴ M ∴ ” Sébastian de las Cas es. De las Cas es did not judge it appr opriate to reestablis h the broken relations with the various Cohen “Orients”, and to recreate union and unite the Rite.

The occult teachings of Martinez de Pasqually were thus transmitted down to the XIX th Century, on the one hand by the Elus Cohen, of which one of the last direct representatives was the “T ∴ P ∴ M ∴ ” Destigny , who died in 1868; and on the other hand through cert ain affiliate s of the “ Scottish Rectified Rite ”, also called the “ Chevaliers Bienfaisants de la Cité Sainte 12 ”, a mystica l masonic rite which ha d initia lly c ome out of the “Templar Rite of S trict Observance” (Ge rman masonry), in it s original form, but later became completely indep ende nt.

THE DOCTRINE Like all esoteric schools, the Mart inist doctrine, that whic h had been defined by Martinez de Pasqually in his “Treaty on the Reintegration of Beings”, necessarily has recourse to exotericism in order to explain metaphysical truths, w hich by their nat ure are difficult to distinguis h and explain. Thus it is integrally atta ched to the Western Tradition, and more particularly that of Christianity. Concerning the issue of the First Cause (God), Martinism made its own the conclus ions to which ending in Christina theologians and Hebrew Kabbalists, at least as to the principl es on which different schools are in agreement for all times: divine ternary, divine “persons”, emanation, etc... Concerning the rest, it is more parti cularly gnostic (although presenting this thesis under a different form from t hose schools usually covered by this word), since it places in principle an equal n ecessity on Knowledg e and Faith, and the fact that Grace must, in order to act effectively, be completed through the intelligent, comprehensive and free acti on of Man. It is because of these different motifs that Martinez de Pas qually presented the esotericism of his school from the point of view of the J udeo- Christian tradition. This Treatise, of which the Master w as most certai nly the author, flowed from traditional documents owned by his family from t he time that a forebear, who was a member of the Tribunal of the Inquisition, had se ized them from Arab or Jewish her etics in Spain. These documents had comprised Latin manuscripts, copies of originals in Ar abic, themselves der ived from Hebrew clavicles. Be that as if may, here is a summary of the “Treaty of th e Reintegr ation of Beings”, a work as rare as it is diffic ult, since it is not exactly in line with the general traditions which inspired it. * * * The World, considered as the “mate rial domain”, subject to our senses, and “spiritual regions” from the Beyond, is not the work of God himself, who is considered as Absolute. It is the Gospel of St. John which teaches us: “ In the beginning ” (that is to say, when “Time” began, the period when relative beings were manifested), “ was the Word ” (the Logos, the Divine Word) “ The Word was by God ...” (literal expression, us ing the better Greek text than the “w ith God” of ordinary versions), - 22 - "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) “ The Word was god ...” (and not God with a capita l letter. The Greek text has no article; the Word is thus on of the “elohim” or S ons-of-God; the word “elohim” in Hebrew signifies “Him-the-gods”. 13 “All things were m ade by Him , and without Him was not anything made ...” (John, I) 14 This Word is what the Kabbalah c alls Adam Kadmon, he who (in all the ancient religious traditions) created the inferior beings by hi s w ord , through naming them (understood: to real Life , made manifest): “And Adam gave names to all the cattle and the birds of t he ai r, to all the beasts of the fields, but for Man, there was not a help suitable for him ...”(Genesis, I, 20). These “beasts of the fi eld”, these “bir ds of the air” are not ordinary beings by this name. The esoteric meaning nam es the creatures, inferior to the Man- Archetype, peopling the “planes” or worlds of the Beyond, the “ spiri tual regions ” to which we make a higher allusion. At the time of this crea tion, God availed himself of an intermediary. This is confirmed by Chapter I of Genesis (vv. 1-2, 3): “ The earth (p rimordial Matter), Chaos) was without form and void, and the Spirit-of-God moved upon the face of the Waters ” (th e nous of the Egyptians, the more subtle element of this Matter). The expression “Spirit- of-God” has a capital letter, thus designating a Spirit which is distinct from God, and not God’s spirit; which would be a nonsense, since God is necessarily spirit in Himself! Also, Genesis does not tell us that “ God m oved upon the face of the Waters ”... This is why it later teaches us that: “The Eternal God took t he Man, and placed him in the Garden of Eden, to keep it and to cultivate it...” (Genesis, II, 15) This Garden is a symbol, signifying Divine Knowledge, which is acc essible to relative beings. In fact, the secr et tradition of the Kabbalah if frequently called the mystic Orchard. In Hebrew, orchard is gineth, a word formed from three letter s ( gimel , nun , tau ), initials of the three secondary sciences, keys to the Kabbalah: G ematria, N otarikon, T emurah. Original Man as refer red to in Gen esis, in its purely symbolic account, was not a being of flesh lik e us, but a Spirit, emanated by God, composed of a “form” (which Genesis calls the body ), analogous to the “glorious body” defined by theologians , created by t he Eternal God, and of an animating spark whic h is wholly divine, since G enesis tells us that it was the very “breath” of God. Our Man-Archetype is thus semi -divine. He was sprung from the pri mordial Matter (of Chaos , composed of symbolic Earth and Water) 13 In the same way it was p ointed out and unde rlin ed by the Abbé Loi sy in his “F ourth Go spel ” ( Quat rièm e Evan gile ). - 23 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"R.

Howev er, the Creator-Word and the Redeemer-Word are different. It is indisputable that the Ch rist (whom Martinez called the Repair er ) is at the same ti me both god (by his origin) and man (by his incarnation) . Theology has shown this. But, just as a ten-year-o ld child and the old man who he will later become are one and the same person (with different characteristics and countenance) !...ther e us a continuity of absolute conscious ness between them, even if ther e is no longer a similarity of face, and inferior reactions. In a similar manner a soul which animates an ordinary human bod y, then animates another, twenty c enturies later, will be identical in these two different manifestations , even though these manifestations can appear to be diametrically opposed, by reas on of the oscillat ory “game” which is usually called “karma”. Alongside Adam Kadmon (Archetypal or Cosmic Man), there existed other Beings, issued from a previous ac t of Creation, of a different nature and “plane”, without any connection to that des cribed in the Tradition of Genesis. This creation was that of the “Angels”, whic h some other traditions relate and which are described in all religions . These tw o different creations are implied in the first v erse of Ge nesis: “ In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth ”. Immediately, Genesis moves on from the first creation (about which it appears Moses had no information) and passes on to the second: “ The Earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep ...” (Genesis I, 2). Other elements of the Judeo-Christian Tradition t each us that the beings from this first Creation (symbolized by “Heaven”), that is to say the Ange ls, divid ed into two categories – the faithful Ang els and the rebellio us Ange ls – following a test , required by God. This has been poorly underst ood. God, principle of infinite perfection, could not tempt the A ngles after their emanation, nor reject them after their involution. On the con trary: some ent ities, having completed the Mi ssion for which they had been emanated by God (that is to say liberated, necessarily endowed with free will), had refused to reintegrate with the Absolute, the Divine Plane, source of Sovereign Good . They preferred the “ me ”, momentary, perishable and illusory, over the “ one ”, eternal, real and - 24 - "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) imperishable. They preferred to li ve “ outside ” of God, rat her than to be reabsorbed by Him, thus benefiting from His infinite perfection. It is thus th ey who, for the time being, have become dis tanced from God through an act of free will, albeit misguided. It is not the Absolute which unjustly rejected them, nor was H e the c ause of their exile. In consequence, return and redemption remains possible, when the celestial Entity acquiesc es and once more follows the Divine path. But in the meantime, bef ore this return to Light and Immanent Truth, by their egoistic attitude, they remain: rebellio us (to the first and constant offer from the divine); misguided (sinc e they exist outside of their legitim ate destiny); perverse (si nce the are living “outside” of the Sovereign Good, and thus “in the Bad”). Now, every corrupt thing tends, by its very nature, to corrupt that w hich is healthy. And in the realm of spiritual beings this is even more true than in the material domain, for there are intermingled: envy or jealousy (consciousness, despite everything, of a real inferiority), pride (desire to have the last word!), and intellig ence (as before, but i n carrying out these defects to the maximum). That is why Tradition tells us that the Ense mble of perverse spiritual Beings (the Egregore of evil), denoted by the image of the Serpent, were jealous of this being, which was super ior to them, and the “image” of God, from whom these fallen Entities claimed to have withdrawn. And so they acted on Adam Kadmon ( telepathically , no doubt), inciting him to overstep the bounds of his natural pos sibilities . Being mixed by nature, part spiritual and par t explic it, androgynous, in which For m and Spirit mutually inte rpenetrate, the Archetypal Man had to maintain a certain harmony, a necessary equilibrium, in this Domain where God had placed him. He had to see to his orders, do the work, and continue the busines s of the “Spirit- of-God” of which he was the reflection, the steward, the celestial Jack-of-all-trades... It was in this role of Architect of the Universe that Adam Kadmon was overseer, but of a Universe more subtle than ours, the “Kingdom” not of this world , as the Evangelists described it. Under the impetus of the perverse me taphysical Entities, Archetypal Man was transformed into an independent De miurge. Repeating their error, he altered and disturbed the Laws which it had been his task to uphold. Presumptuous and rebellious, he tried to become a creator in his own right and, through his works, to equal G od Himself. He succeeded only in modifying h is origina l Destiny. - 25 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"R.

Vaughan (200 2) It is thus that the two ident ical legends, that of Lucifer, first of Angels , and that of Adam, first of Men , relate their parallel stories to us. It is perhaps from this tradition that the idea of offering t he first fruits of the harvest or the firstborn of the flock to t he gods or to God comes from. And it is fact that, in the symbolic account of Humanity which we call Genesis , all the elder sons – Cain, Ham, Ishmael, E sau, etc – are mysteri ously marked for a contrary destiny. But whereas God, in H is infinite po ssibilities, could dr aw something from nothing, Man, a creature of limited possib ilities, could only modify that which was there already, and could not extract anything from nothing. Archetypal Man, wishing to create sp iritual beings, as God had created the Angels, could only objectivize his own concepts . Desirous of giving them form, he could only integrate them in the coarsest Matter. Wanting to animate Chaos (the “exterior Darkness”), as God had animated the metaphysical World whic h he had originally entr usted to him, he became swallowed up in it himself. In effec t God “ being ”, in the most absolute sense of the word (” I A m That I Am ”, he said to Moses on Sinai), it wa s impossible for “nothingnes s: to have existed previously. In order to create original Matte r , God simply retracted a part of His i nfinite perfection from a part of H is infinite e ssence. This partial retraction of the m ost absolute spiritual Perfection inevit ably resulted in the creation of relative m ateri al Im perfection . This explains why Creation, whatever else if might be, can never be perfect. It is necessarily imperfect b y the fact that it is not God! So, in imitation of the Absolute , Adam Kadmon tried to create for himself a “fi rst matter”. But he was an inexperienced alc hemist, and this was the origin of his Fall. Genesis tells us in Chapter II, 23 – 24: “ And Ada m said: this is now bone of m y bones, and flesh of m y flesh (he therefore kept th e spirit and soul to himself). She shall be called Woman – in Hebrew Isha – because she was taken out of Man .” It was this new Matter, the Eve of Genesis, the symbolic Woman, that Adam “penetrated” in order to create Life. The Archetypal Man was thus degraded in trying to equal God. His new domain was the hylic World of the Gnostics, our material Universe, a worl d full of imperfecti ons and ills . The little good that remained came from the former perfection of the Archetypal Man, for , split into two different b eings , that origina l perfe ction could not be whole in each of them...hence the Fall. - 26 - "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"R.

She was c ertainly the Mother of all that is, but only of all that is “be neath the Heavens” ...put simply, Isis, Eve, Demeter, Rhea, Cybele were all but symbols of Material Nature, emanated from A dam Kadmon, as personified by the Black Virg ins , emblematic of the Prim a Materia .

In a parallel way we can say fr om Genesis that Adam became Su lphur , Eve became Salt and Cain was the Mercury in this symbolic triad. These are terms which Alchemy knows under the titles of the King , the Queen , and the Servant of the wise... Thus one conceives why, at every level, Universal Matter is alive , as is accepted by ancient alchemy and m odern chemistry, and how, in its manifestations, it can be more or less conscious and intelligent. Adam Kadmon, the first demi urge Intelligenc e, was manifested, dispersed, scattered, i mprisoned across the four r ealms of Nature: mineral, vegetable, animal, human (between whic h besides, ther e is no possibility of continuity). It is this dressing in “skins of animals” which we read in Genesis: “ And God made for Man and Woman “robes of skin”, and clothed them ...” (Ch. III, 21). This new Universe has equally become the refuge of the fallen Ent ities. They have taken refuge there to distance themselves further from the Absolute, in the vain hope of escaping the ever-present eternal Laws. - 27 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"R.

Just as the soul of Archetypal M an is imprisoned in univ ersal Matter, so the soul of the Individual Person is imprisoned in the material body. Physical death (the only effect indicating that it is merited, Genesis tells us...) and the reincarnations which follow, are the means by which the fallen Spirits manifest their control over Man. Then one better understands the words of the Redeemer, “understood” by the Prophets, for exam ple Isaiah: “O Grave, where is thy Victory? O Death, w here is thy Sting?...” ( the sting of the senses, which incite the separated soul to reincarnate in a material body). The Strength, Wisdom and Beauty whic h still make themselves known in this materi al Univ erse are due to the e fforts of Archetypal Man to once again become what he was before his fall. The contrary qualities are manifest by the fallen Entities, in order to main tain the “climate” that they wished him to create, to maintain the st ate that they wanted of ol d, when they deliberately interrupted their return to the Absolute. Archetypal Man can only regain possession of his original Splendor and Liberty if he can separate himself from this matter in which he is caught on every side. To achiev e this, it is nec essary for every cell composing his body (that is, Individual Men), after a natural death, to reconsti tute the Archetype through ultimate reinte gration, and thus escape the cycles of reincarnation. Now, the m icrocosms r efer to t he Macrocosm. Individual Men being material reflections of the Archetype, are thus equally reflections of the divine (if several levels inferior), just as the Archetype is himself the reflection of God, the first Creator-Word or Logos of the Spirit -of-Go d referred to in Genesis. Thus, he is the “Grand Architect of the Universe”. Every cult 15 of adoration rendered to him is therefore a satanic form of worship which is rendered to Man and not to the Absolute. And th is is why Masonry INVOKES him without adoring him. But, since Man is immersed in the dem oniac atmosphere of this Material World where at every moment he inhales the malefic intelligence, as Martinez de Pasqually tells us, and because he is in a poor position to resist, the Creator restored equili brium by detaching a Major Spirit from his Spiritual Circle to be the guide, support, counsel and c ompanion of the Mino r This Major Spirit emanated and descended from the celestial Immensity to be 15 The wo rd ‘ cult’ is used in it s Fre nch se nse, to denote any religio us pra ctice, which has n one of the negati vity which ha s accru ed to the English sen se - PV. - 28 - "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"R.

Yet the counsel of the Major Spirit is not enough. The operative assistance of an Elect Minor is also required. The assistance whic h he brings to his “reconciliation” is twofold.

Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) THE ORIGINS OF THE DOCTRI NE There is no doubt as to the direct origins of the doctrine which was transmitted to us in the symbolic work of Martinez de Pasqually, “Of the Reintegration of Beings”. It has a very orthodox Judeo- Christian basis, interpreted and commented upon with the hel p of traditions born directly from the Sepher-ha-Zohar, and from all the keys of Jewish esotericism (Kabba lah). But one point dominates all these exegetic al conclus ions, however: that is the origin of the tradition which s uggests that Archetypal Man had lost his original glory and nature in wanting to exceed his natural power a nd equal God. This is what we are going to attempt to clarify. * * * It is possible that, if metaphysica l assumptions have indeed imbued the majority of religious traditions of Hu manity, this is because of similarly metaphysical evidence. This evidence would have been perceived by intuition by the early sages and thinkers, or would have been made accessible to them through super normal manifestations or, more si mply, would have been communicated to them by means of the channel of anagogical dreaming, helped by the subtler psychic abilities they possessed over those of modern Humanity. But it remai ns no less evident that, in another sphere, phallic cults are equally important in the origin of early religion. We do not ignore the extreme aversion of the puritans of all confessions for these cults and their survivors. But perhaps it would be more reasonable, and in any case more scientific, to study the underlying causes and truly secr et teachings of these strange cults, than to condemn them in the name of a morality which has no business in this area of study. In fact, if we discard the particular position of the decadent Roman church, we would argue that among the early religions, the sexual organ is sacred . The “loinc loth” is less a veil thrown over something shameful and degrading, than a necessary and ritual obstacle desti ned to protect a sacred organ from the eyes of stranger. Henc e the tattoos of magico-religious characters on the undergarments of our pr imitives; and hence, in a different field, the removal of the generative organs (nearly everyw here) suffered by the vanquis hed warrior, which in other cases is replac ed by the head, or by parts of the head (ear, scalp, etc...). If the sexual or gan was something to be ashamed of, our primitive would not giv e it the same preeminence as the skull, that noble organ and personifying most the personality of the conquered. We shouldn’t omit to remember that the generative symbols in anc ient Greece (at Eleus is, for example) or ev en in modern India, are the i mages of - 32 - "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"R.

Finally, it would be childish to sugges t that Man should be ashamed of that which Nature (or God, according to faiths) had granted him from birth, since no shame is attached in any way to the reproductive organs of animals, and even less those of vegetables! * * * Therefore we have no hesitation, for all these reasons, in considering the esotericis m of Sexuality as one of the possible keys which we introduce to rejoin the original source where the majo rity of dogmas are fetched up. And if we disapprove of the outrages t hat esotericism has generated through distancing itself from thes e sources of information, we equally dis approve of the childis h Puritanism in which s o many repressed, obsessed, and indeed maniacs, to intransigent exeget ical pretensions have foundered. * * * Man is a reduction of the Univers e. Spiritually made in the image of his Creator, as Genesis tells us, he is materi ally conceived as being of the Cosmos, as the Kabbalah teaches us, and, by comparison to the Macrocosm, he constitutes the Microcosm. At the level of Man, the Phallus fulfil ls the same office. Man is thus the Macrocosm and the Phallus the Microcosm. In fact, the first childlik e, imprec ise and awk ward figures by which the Primitive chanced to repres ent the human silhouette always affected a phallic aspect, be it a vague cylinder, a colu mn surmounted by a sphere which is separated by a constriction. Such im ages are presented to us in imprecise effigies des tined for the rite s of Magic (figures of wax, clay, wood, etc...) According to current thinking, eac h may be seen as an imperfect human effigy, or that of a phallus. * * * What particularly char acterizes this organ is that it is the only one, among all the organs of Man’s exteri or body, to be endowed with an apparent - 33 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"R.

It is medically proven that sexual reactions can definitely be independent of the conscious thought of the indiv idual. This is generally not the case wit h other members: arms , legs, feet, hands. We are going to use the word “member”. Note also that this phallus also carries the epithet virile mem ber . This also makes it an organ apart from others. So we may conclude that it is possibl e the natural activity of this organ generated a parallel between the destiny of Archetypal Man and that of its natural representation, in t he minds of the earliest thinkers of Humanity. It is also possible that this rapport was established unconsc iously , without this parallel being actively envisaged and exam ined, by the singular fact of the important role that the sexual aspect pl ays in human nature. In this case, it would be the subconsc ious sexual activity which would be at the ori gin of this metaphysical “conclusion”, the fall of Archetypal Man, re sulting in a theory of creation!... The fact sh ould cert ainly not be rejected out of hand. In his “Psychoanalysis of Fire”, Gaston Bachelard, teacher at the Sorbonne, judiciously under lined the analogical link which the Psychologist established between the ways of creating fire for the Primitive, and the ways of coupling. It is clear that the Primitive was able to establis h a link between the action of rubbing a wooden r od in a hole bored in a large plank and the creative spark of Fire whic h finally sprang forth, and the same natural gesture demanded of the creative instinct. At all events, these various view s on the symbolism of the Phallus allo w us to conceive h ow it mi ght over time have become the living sy mbol of Divine Power, manifested in Man and through Man. One can also conclude how the deep veneration, creat ed in the Temple of Eleu sis at the time of the appearanc e of the Theophallos in the hands of the Grand Hierophant, was justified. For it was not about vener ating an organ of material and gross pleasures by which man’s spirituality was irremediably chained to the heavy rock of the vulgar pleasu res of the flesh, and some times to the most ignoble appetites. Quite the contra ry. In the Phallus the ecstati c crowd saw the divine mystery by which they were permi tted to pierce the mysteri es of their extra-human origins, to understand by what way his fall had been effected, and how Humanity could break free of his chains and, at a single light, reunites with his original divinity.

Ev e also carries the name “Janua Inferni”, the Gate of Hell, and Mary the title of “Janua Coeli”, the Gate of Heaven. Note that, on the subject of these two symbolic “Gates”, that they are analogous to those guarded by the god Janus, the two-faced god, half masculine and half feminine, whose Festival s were loc ated at the Solstices of Winter (Door of Heaven) and Summer (Door of Hell). The Zodiac has retained the esotericism of these two period in the signs of Capricorn (the Goat, which ever has a tendency to c limb) and of Cancer (the Crab, who creeps in the slime...). In astrologica l symbolism Canc er, equivalent to Janus Inferni corresponds anatomically to the Uter us, in the body of woman. This is truly the infernal door by which the human Soul, abandoning the superior states of the Divine Plane, is inca rnated and becomes trapped in a body of flesh, held in the malefic vortex of the Wheel of Fortune. It is in consequence of this esoteric distinction between the “Woman of Life” and the “Woman of Death” that t he Knight in the Middle Ages, having submitted to the traditi onal rites of th is military Order, chose a “Woman of his Thoughts”, who was never his fiancée, lover or spouse, and with whom he must never enjoy carnal relations. It is also memory of this idealiz ation of Love, of the sublimation of the ideal femini ne that, at the time of their initiation into the Degree of Apprentice, Freemasons receive two pairs of white gloves.

And the King always oc cupies the place and attitude of the phallic organ of the God. It is equally through a discreet reminder of sacred esotericism, that the Builders of the Cathedrals frequently placed in the hand of the Virgin carrying the Child, seated upon a cubic throne in the attitude of Cybele and Rhea the mother-goddesses, the phallic scepter ending in a pine cone.

We are going to try, if not to resolve it comple tely and definitively, at least to bring some unpublished elucidations. It is strongly probable that Martinez de Pasqually invent ed the story about his grandfather, member of the Tribunal of the Inquisition, and because of this the holder of documents seized from the hands of Jewish or Arab heretics. According to this assertion, which hol ds back nothing, these same documents had been the source of his father’s conversion to a heterodox doc trine which would eventually be taught to his son. It is infi nitely more logical to acknowledge that, quite to the contrary , we should read between the lines to get a hint of a language of pure conventi on. So, the truth is re-establis hed, and we are led to consider a more esoteric hypothesis, regarding these documents saved from the Inquisition , of Judeo-Arabic origins (this is reinforced by the Portuguese origins of t he family, at the worst Spanish at a later date), transmitted and elabor ated upon by the spiritual father of Mar tinez de Pasqually! In effect, the “master” in ancient time s wa s called in Greek, the patros , which generally signified the father, and in particular the “ father of initiates ”. Martinez de Pasqually (this has been fairly well established by the historians of the Order and its propagator), had been to Timor, a small Portuguese possession in the Sunda Isl ands . Perhaps he might also have been to China, as is believed. Yet it is neither in these travels, nor in a close contact with Voodoo s orcery in St. Domingo, that one should look for his first initiation! In a special edition of the magazine “The Veil of Isis”, publis hed in 1927, Jean Bricaud expounded on t he history of the Rosicrucian movement, from the first manifestations of the Fraternity of the Rose+Cross at the beginning of the XVII th century. We will briefly summarize this author (and expla in that his position as a high grade me mber of the Order and as patriarch of the gnostic church plac es him as having teachings of value, be they through archives and documents, or through ver bal traditions) and conclude with our personal investigations. * * * From the beginning of the XVI th Century, we find the secret association of the ”Community of Mages”, founded by Cor nelius Agr ippa, in operation. This - 38 - "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) was an association which grouped t ogether contemporar y masters of Alchemy and Magic. When Agrippa arrived in London in 1510, as we learn from his correspondence (Opuscula, t. II, page 1073) , he founded a secret society similar to that which he had founded in France. The members were endowed with specific signs of recognition, and “ passwords”. These members went on to found correspondent associations in many other European states, called “ Chapters ”, for the study of t he “forbidden: s ciences. If we are to believe a manuscript of Mi chael Maier, preserved in the library in Leipz ig, it was this “Community of Mages” which, arou nd 1570 gave birth to the “ Brothers of the Ro se + Cross of Gold ” in Germany . Later on, around 1605, a new mystical confraternity had adopted the Rose and Cross as the emblematic paradigm of its inclin ation. It was the “ Militia Crucifera Evangelica ”, originally founded by Sim on Studion in Nuremberg, in 1598. This confraterni ty reuni ted at the beginni ng of the XVII th Century, as the “ Fraternity of the Rose+Cros s ”. Alongside t hese magic al or alchem ical studies, more operative than speculativ e, the majori ty of br ethren equally pursued the reform of Catholicis m, in trying to lead it back to its original purity and simplicity, through penetrating traditional es oteric t eachings in imitation of the ancient Gnostics. The Rosicr ucian movement manifest ed itself differently, depending on the country, the spiritual legacy, and the sc holastic education of the adepts. In Spain, it was rather orientated towa rds Roman Catholic ism, with a greater understanding, and more mystical as well. In Eastern Europe, in Germany, its propagators were on the contrary devoted to Protestantism, such as Valentin Andreæ and Michael Maie r. One of the Rosicrucian Ch ap ters has passed into history: that is the one in Cassel, which was founded there by Count Maurice de Hesse-Cassel, of which Andreæ and Maier were members. Also another Chapter, the “Pal m”, founded in Weimar, too. It was in 1614 – 1615 that the famous public manifestations of the Rose+Cros s took place. The effect was considerable. Profane intellectuals argued over which was better – the Fam a Fraternitatis or the Confessio Fratrum Rosæ-Crucis (Ratisbonne, 1614)! It was then in 1616 that Michael Maier, doctor to Emperor Rudolph II (protector of Hermetists) travel ed to London, where he made contact with Robert Fludd, who organized the adepts in Englan d under the Rosicrucian plan. - 39 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"R.

For details we refer the reader to a work by Sédir on the :”Rose+Croix”. The problems of the age nece ssit ated a schism between the two Rosicrucian inclinations. Two groups were thus born: the one, giving emphasis to mysticism, the study of the Kabbalah, Christian theosophy and ancient Gnosticism, were devoted above all to the interi or life. It is this group which gav e rise to the initiator of Jacob Boehme, who was one of the “influences ” of Saint-Martin. This group reassembled t he Brothers of the Cross of Gold, or the Aureæ Crucis , and was the more myster ious of the two. The second branch, the most numer ous, devoted itself to experim ental research, and to the study of Nature: this was the Rosæ Crucis . In Holland, in England (where Francis Bacon, the author of New Atlantis – which has sometimes been taken as the curriculum of the Intelligen ce Service! – assisted strongly by Robert Fludd, and was perhaps, in reality, the true Shakespeare , as certain historians a ffirm), the movement developed rapidly. The tolerance of public author ities, acquired during the Reformation, led him to avoid being led into the anticleric al attitude which was seen in Latin countries; an attitude justified by the terrifying measures taken by public authorities in Catholic countries when they learned of this spiritualis t movement. It is this second group which shortly after founded the Invisible College , built according to the plan describ ed by Sir Francis Bac on in the Nova Atlantis , and which was later offici ally rec ognized by the King of England, Charles II, under the name of the Royal Soc iety . The Fam a and Confes sio of Valentin Andreæ were translated into English in 1652 by Thom as Vaughan, author of Anthroposophia Theom agica , and many other works on occultism. Although he denied it, Vaughan was in reality one of the chiefs of the Rose-Croix (Wood, in his Athenæ Oxoniensis , tells us: “He was a great chemist, a di stinguished “Son of Fire”, an exp ert physician, and a diligent Brother of the Rosi crucian Fraternity”).

Around 1645 (1645 – 1646 were two fruitfu l years in matters of occult societies... ), a certain number of Rosicrucians had founded an as sociation having as it s objective the study of Nature, but in which the principles and teachings would remain secret, only acces sible to initiates, and presented in a purely allegorical manner. These we re Elias Ashmole, Robert Moray, Thomas Warton, William Oughtred, J ohn Hewitt, John Pearson and William Lilly (the Astrologer). The names of several others have not come down to us. - 40 - "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) In order to better conceal both its ex istence and its activities, which they wished to be purely occult, interior and mysti cal, the Order decided not to remain independent. Followi ng the instigation of Elias Ashmole, they decided to integrate it into an average env ironment, where it could exist without anyone guessing at its existence. Following the custom of the times, which allowed all citizens having freedom of the city of London the right to belong to a guild of craftsmen, as accepted members (that is to say, honorary) , Elias Ashmole affiliated with the Guild of Masonic Builders , placed in the Middle Ages under the mystical patronage of St. John. He later solic ited authorization for t he Society of the Rose+ Cross to meet at the headquarters of the Guild of Masonic Builders , at Mason’s Hall, in Mason’s Al ley, Basinghall Street, London. It was William Preston, in his work: “I llustrations of Masonry” (p. 140) who revealed the subterfuge! The Rosicr ucian spirit, the occult force of the group, while helping the mysterious Order founded by the English Rosicrucians in 1717, had taken the lead of the Fraternity of Freem asons , and in 1723 its members succeeded in modifying the ancient structure of oper ative masons in adding the degree of “Master”. Now, it is in the ritual of this Degree which reveals the actions of the Rose-Croix in all their dignity! It is in the splendid unf olding of the reception into the “Mastership”, i n the moving symbolic death of the profane, heralding the resurrection of the Archetype, that we finally discov er the traditional imprint of ancient initiations, at the same time proving the survival of the very old Alexandrine Gnosis. And, we have seen at t he start of this work, it is this same Englis h Masonry which sent to Martinez de Pa squally, or rather his “father”, the Constitutional Charter permi tting him to establish Lodges... Who could then deny the incontes table direct contact between the Rose+Cros s of England, successors of Robert Fludd and Cornelius Agrippa, and Martinez de Pasqually ? Assur edly no critic in good faith. At the beginning of his aforementi oned work, Jean Bricaud describ ed the possible forerunners of the Rose+Croix. Was the mystic fraternity truly founded by the enigmatic Christian Rosenk reutz? Or does it instead go back to the Castle of the Holy Grail, and from there to the ancient Gnostics? Does it have a more recent origin, and should we consider Paracel sus as its true promoter? Did it already exist in 1484 in Denmark, as Fortuyn affi rms in his De Guildar um Historia ? Could it attribute its foundation to Faustus Socin, as certain traditions suggest, or did it hav e Valentin Andreæ as its father? “So many questions which I am unable to resolve” said Bricaud. - 41 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"R.

We believe that it is truly the direct , uninterrupted survival of the great ancient and medieval heterodo x currents, w hich we call the Gnostics and the Cat hars. We will no w explain the reason for our arguments. * * * In his “Disquisitions”, publis hed by the anti-masonic writ er Benjamin Fabre (“an initiate of the Higher Secret S ocieties”), the marquis François de Chefdebien de Saint-Amand, a member of most of the Masonic Rites of his age, and known in contemporary in itiatic Orders (1753-1814) under the “nomen” of Franciscus Eques A Capite Galeato, tells us that Montpellier, birthplace of Cambacérès, and one of t he famous towns of the Albigens ian epic, was at the same time one of the towns in France which was most attached to the occult sciences, and one of the cradles of French Freemasonry. He recounts the following ep isode, whic h is most meanin gful. “From the year 1723, Monsieur de R oquelaure discovered a very curious Sect, called the Multiplia nts 19 , and learned that the members of this fraternity held their assemblies in a house belon ging t o a certain woman called the Verchand , in the road which runs from the Tri perie up to the Temple well”. They evidently took hold of the pri ncipal members of the organization, and seized their papers. “The list of members of the Sect”, d’Aigrefeuille, historian of Montpel lier and cousin of the marquis of Chefdebien tells us, “is dated 6 th June, 1722. It is entitled: ‘Original of t he Names and Surnames of the Children of Sion ’. Their number rose to around two hundred and thirty-two people, from various places in the Cévennes and the environs of Lunne l”. The members of the fraternity we re all artisans (therefore tied to apprenticeships), and the poor of the region. “We have convinc ing proofs in their own writings, that they had Holy Communion, and that Jean Vess on had oft en administered it, acting in the quality of minister. One also disc over s the act by which he was elevated to this charge, from the simp le cooper that he was prev iously, by the imposition of hands by the whole Assembly. “The great number of vision, prophesies and sermons which are found among their papers, gave plenty of work to the Commission, as much due to 19 Multipliants : Multipliers – PV. - 42 - "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"R.

The second will be on the De vil, in the form of the serpent, the third on Man and Woman. “Jacob, in a prophetic sermon on 2 nd December, 1722, said these suitable words on the Roman Church: God blessed and consec rated the three Sacrificers in the highest Heavens with the salt and oil of Grace. He chose the Widow to represent his church, which he wished to make flourish and triumph over the earth. This Roman Church has remained a wido w until the present, and slave to the elders of the Roman Church; but it must be overthrown with its elders and its pride exposed to the fa ce of the world, after having been hidden to Kings and princes, by human science.” The rest of their writings cont ain a thousand extravaganc es which they attribute to the influenc e of the Holy Spirit. One finds almost everywhere: “This is wh at the Holy Spirit said; this is what the Holy Spirit orders you to say”.

Benjamin Fabre, right-thinking author and so-called Christian, must surely have been astonished that men and women who only sinned through an excess of Christian mysticism, were put to death or buried alive in dungeons ! He must surely have been amazed by the fact that grand titled courtiers who, a few years earlier, had celebrated sa crilegious masses in the nude, with any amount of gorging on newbor ns or stolen children, for punishment only received royal disgrac e!

Madame la Comtesse de Bénévent, who in these first years, saw the leaders of the Multipliants depicts them on the day that they were arrested, as young men of good bearing, curly haired, dressed in white albs, wearing red hat s. She added that a seat used by the Sect members had been given to Sainte -Catherine chur ch in Montpellier. “Each of us can recognize, in the stor y of these unfortunates, the origin of certain colors, certain express ions and allegorical instructions that som e freem asons appear to have inher ited .” - 44 - "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"R.

A few years after, Benjamin Fabre noted, Montpellier was covered with masonic Lodges frequented by the officers, magist rates, teachers and students of its celebrated University. This town even became the seat of the Directorate of the III rd Province of the Templar Rite of Stri ct Observance, that of S eptimanie, for which the marquis of Chefdebien wa s the sole repres entative at the General Convent at Wi lhelmsbad! * * * So here is indisputably the survival of the Cathars, or at the least of a like sect, found again in the Albig ensian heartland in the XVIII th Century.

We see him in turn affiliate, founder, m odifier of masonic Lodge in Montpellier (Chapter of “Scottish Judges ”), in Toulous e, Marseille, Avigno n, Foix (Temple of Elus Co hen and “Joshua” Lod ge), Bordeaux. It is in Montpellie r that Martinez produced his Masonic Charter fo r the first time, issued on the 20 th May, 1738 to his “father” by the Grand Master of the S tuart Lodge. But nobody has drawn attention to the fa ct that this aforementioned father would have already been sixty-eight y ears old since, as we have seen, he was born in 1671. In addition, Mart inez was born in Grenoble in 1727 21 , according to the conclusions of a majo rity o f authors. His father mu st therefore have been in London the following year. Thi s is not improbable, but nevertheless reinforces our hypothesis that the spiritual father of Martinez de Pasqually is not Messi re de la Tour de la Case, born in Alica nte (Spain) in 1671... Another curious fact is goi ng to support our assertion. In his esoteric signature, Martinez de Pasqually uses what he calls “our customary characters”. Among these enigm atic paradigms figures what has been called the “figure f our” (see next diagram). This m ysterious sign figures frequently am ong the inscriptions disc overed by O. Rohn in the grottoes of the Aude region, in the heart of the legendary region of the Albigensian see, in the grottoes of Ornolac, m ost notably of Lam brives. These inscriptions were a ttributed by all the exam iners to the Cathars who took refuge in these caverns. When the Cathars, gnostic surviv al in the Middle Ages apparently disappeared, the same “figure four” was then adopted by another great society of thought, which we have named the Agla . 21 This m ight be a m isprint: if he recei ved the Charte r in 1738 a s the previ ous pa ragra phs assert s, he would not ne ed to be in Lond on in 172 8 - PV. - 45 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"R.

The collective “glyph” of this vast a ssociation was the “fou r”. It figured, accompanied by flourishes or distinctive adjuncts, in the i ndiv idual cipher of each master of this large confra ternity. Léon Gruel, in his work 22 , gathered hundreds of these companions ’ signatures. Frequently it surmounted a second gly ph, which often indicated a second interior association. Thus the hexagram or “Seal of Solomon”, the “planetary seal” of Saturn, or the Monogram of Mary, denoted an association with alchemy or Hermeticism; while the heart, which figured on playing cards, indic ated another branch, in whic h Myst icism – and more particularly that of Kabbalism – were studies and pr acticed. And Martinez de Pasqually was a Kabbalist! Seals of Agla It is to this l ast group to which Ki ng François I belonged.

Within the group of master-stationer s, esoteric traditions originally derived from Cathar and Albigensian doctrines were preserved.

In fact, the illuminators’ principa l task was copying and decorating Books of Hours, Gospels and Bibles. Had that which had been entrusted to them always been truly orth odox ?... In the ghetto in the main cities, other illumin ators, in this case the Jews, patiently copied the sacred texts comp rising the “Torah” onto interminable rolls of skin. Some contact was es tablished between Jewish copy ists and Christian illuminators, contact which had originated out of professional care and curiosit y, touching on the secrets of making black or colored ink s, that of their placement on fragile surfac es or rough and hard parchment, the preparation of Armenian bole (clay ), desti ned to support the gold and silver in illuminating, etc...These regular meet ings between parc hment makers and printers achieved a u niting of the anc ient craft of illumination and the new invention of printing. The pocketbook, easy to dissimulate, easy to handle s ecretly, was for heterodox doctrines a precious means of diffusion. An abundance of works which shouldn’t decent ly have seen the light of day in a Catholic state, not receiving the royal “privilege” of public ation, were supposed to have been printed in those states devoted to the Re formation, or so re mote for the time s that nobody was able to verify where they were from! Thus cities such as Amsterdam, Edinburgh and Geneva had the benefit of works which were in reality printed clandest inely in Paris, Lyon or Brussels. One can understand from this overview, that all that was clandest ine, heretical or forbidden had to pass through the hands of printers, stat ioners, engravers and book-binders, if they were to be disseminated! These ar tisans thus found themselves in a position to well unders tand the esoteric teachings, forbidden to the common man, and by virtue of the attraction of forbidden fruit, to join together.... So was born Agla , an esoteric group if it indeed was, which in the Renaissance welcom ed the spiritual her itage of the medieval Cathars and Gnostics.

Who was Enoch, the personage who Ma rtinez de Pasqually partic ularly emphasized in his “Treatise on the Reinte gration of Beings”? In our opinion, this is the k ey to the e nigma. To begin with, the first appearanc e of the name is as the elder son of Cain (Genesis IV, 17). It w as he who was t he builder of the first city: Enochia 24 . Later, this name is carried by the seventh patriarch from Adam, the son of Jared (Genesis V, 23, 24). This is w hat the bible tells us about this subject: “And all the days that Enoch liv ed on earth were 365 years. He w alked with God, and appeared no more, for G od raised him up.” (Genesis V, 23, 24). “Enoch pleased God. He has been trans ferred to Paradise, to bring in the future Nations into repentance” ... (Ecclesiastes: XLIV, 16). Besides, he is the only man, reintegrated into the Realm of Eden (or Paradise) while liv ing , who was chosen by God to announce judgment to the fallen Angels and to keep them captive, according to the Ethiopian apocrypha known as the “Book of Enoch”. Thus it is he who is the master of the divine “Realm”, and the jailer of the “watcher s of the Heavens” , fallen because of their incubic union wit h the daught ers of Men. Now, it is precisely that role which Martinez de Pas qually originally ass igns to Adam Kadmon, in his “Treatise on the Reintegrati on”. For in Hebrew, without taking account of the masoretic vowel-points , Enoch signifies – just like Adam – Man ... 24 This is not nec ess arily correc t. The Bible (Ki ng Jam es’s Version) g ives the im pression that it wa s Cai n wh o wa s the buil der: “And Cai n kne w his wife; and she conceived, an d bare En och ; and he build ed a city, and calle d the nam e of the city, a fter the nam e of his son, Enoch.” (Gen.

Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) In the Eastern traditions, Enoch is frequently confused with the son of Cain of the same name, under the mystony m of Idris. For the Christians of Asia Minor, Enoch is the equivalent of the Greek Tris megistos and the Egyptian Herm es . For the Kabbalists and the rabbis, he is also Metatron Serpanim “Principle of Light”), of Mikaël (“Who is like God”). He is in fact a cosmic or solar genius , by the fact that he lived 365 years, symbolic number of the solar cycle. He is related to Adam -dem iurge , by the fact that his homonym built the first city. And as he must return at the end of ti me, he is thus also the “Alpha and Omega”, the first and the last ... It is by esoteric parallel with the l egend of Enoch, that traditional custom tells us to ignore seek ing the plac e w here the funereal remains of those who were the Grand Initiates, the “Unknown S uperiors” in the literal sense of the word, might be careful ly hidden. So it is for Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, Martinez de Pasqually, Claude de Sa int-Martin, without going back to the mysterious origina l initiators – Hermes , Pythagoras, etc... – those arrayed in the category of eponyms.... The “operations” of the Elus Cohen were as follows: 1. Cult of Expiation; 2. Cult of general Particular Grace; 3. Cult of operations against Demons; 4. Cult of Prevaricat ion and Conserv ation; 5. Cult agains t War; 6. Cult of Opposition to Enemies of the Divine Law; 7.

Cult of annual Dedicat ion of a ll the “operations” to the Creator. 2. The Rites The Theur gy of Martinez de Pas qually, traditional in its principles, nevertheless possesses some very specific characters. We note the main ones here: 1. – His “magic circles ” raise more of the theory of “figuration” (of a place or a hyperphysical domain), than that of “protection” (ordinary magic). These are, in reality, the psychic “batteries”’ 25 of the World, the “spatial effigies”, in and on which the Operator tries to be able to act. 25 Voults – PV. - 52 - "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A.

It is the Romany practice whic h required one to light a blessed ca ndle at sunset on a recent tomb, and then carry it home still lit, at midnight if possible, to enter into co mmunication with the soul thus “raised” from the sleep of the Dead. It is also that explained in the Talmudic treatise “Ketuboth”, which affirms that: “...the Spir its of the Dead return w illingly in those places where a light shines to their sake” (a necromantic altar, composed of a real skull, a black candl e, and a censer, placed in a triangle, according to the secret teachings of the Sepher Yetzirah). One will note the total identification of this usage with that of the dagyde, or representative figure of wax, like the church candle ... 26 3. – The absence of the ritual Sw ord (blade, poignard, etc...) and in general all metallic objects . One knows the univers al taboo regarding iron and steel, which has its parallel in the “divestiture of metals” in the Degree of Apprentice of masonic init iation. But one notes that, if this absenc e is common to certain ancient Rituals (s ee, notably, “The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage”) for the disciples of Martinez de Pasqually, it extends to all ob jects of the cult. Thus, the censer itself, generally of bronze or gilded copper, is replaced by an “ brand new earthenware plate ”. The shoes, whic h are usually nailed and shod with iron, are replaced with sandal s with soles of cork, to i solate. And the “sashes” or “collars” of masonic ins piration wor n by the Operator, are without ritual jewels. Better still, the Pantacles of protection that ordinary Magic has in lead (instead of gold, silv er or pewter...) are constituted by a “scapular” and a “small shield ” of virgin parc hment... The sword, often replaced by the W and (of laurel, almond, hazel bush or tree) is absent in the Magi c of the Elus Cohen. A candle (the mystic “rod of light”...) takes its place, at a particular instant, held by the Operator. It is there: the applic ation of the occult privilege of the c andle (condensat ion of fluids) united with that of the flame (emission or dissociation, through the power of the “points”). The hand c harges the wax (coagula), and next the flame emits, in the form of luminous waves (solve), that which Thought has visualized, and that which the Word has manifested. 26 The Skull eq uates to the l etter Mem , th e Cens er to the letter Aleph , the Candl e to the letter Shin , the Mother-letters sy mbolizi ng the Three Sup erior Element s in pra ctical Ka bbala h. - 53 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"R.

We are going to see this presently... 3. The Cosmogony The aim of the “Operations of the Cult” (to use t he favori te expression of the Elus Cohen) is to a llow Man to do two things: a) to the Individual Man, to rein tegrate into the Archetypal Man; b) \t to the Archetypal Man (once restor ed), to re gain the Realm from which the fallen Entities had turned him out (in making him fall through his own fault), and retake possession of his first “glo rious Nature”. Paragraph a) correlates to a material regime n (purification of the material human Aura through abs tinence from cert ain nutritional elements which are too coarse or animal), and a moral regimen (pur ification of the spiritual human Aura through the rejection of such and such shortcomings, disappearance of noxious habits, etc...). Paragraph b) correlates to a battle, a very real hyperphysical fight against the rival Entities, by means of theurgic Operations. So, in a hyperphysical battle of this type, how can Man logic ally trust the circumference of his Circles of protec tion to guard him from these extrahuman entities, whom he rightly aims to ej ect from this Realm where he wo rks? What, preci sely, is this Realm? The Kabbalah, like the holy Scriptures, calls it the “King dom”, which in Hebrew is Malkuth . The texts of the Old and New Testaments make frequ ent allusions to this retaking of possession of the aforementi oned “Kingdom ” by Man. Let us cite from memory, and by right of examples taken by chance, these verses from Daniel: “And at the same time, the Kingdom, the power and the expanse of the empire of that which is under the Sun, will b e given to the people of the Saints of the Most High! For his Kingdom is an everlasting realm, to which all Kings 27 shall be subject with a complete submission”. (Daniel, VII, 27). 27 The Kings – that is to say the Kings of Edom , the Demons. - 54 - "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A.

Or also this from the Gospels: “Come, Blessed ones of my Fa ther, and possess the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the World...” This Kin gdom of Malkuth, well know n to those familiar with the Kabbalah, Man’s own realm, perceiv es each of the other Sephiroth or spheres reflected in itself, as the Kabbalah teaches of all the Sephiroth. Thus the whole Kabbalistic Tree (esoteric image of the famous orchard – or in Hebrew, gineth , a word formed from the initials of the three Kabbalistic sciences par excellence : Gematria, Notarikon, Temurah – of the garden of Eden, and the two trees : that of Life Eternal and that of the Know ledge of Good and Evil...), this Kabbalistic Tree must have its micr ocosmic reflection in Malkuth, and all the metaphysical Spheres as well. This is confirmed by the Sepher ha Zohar ! But this is all forgotten by Man. The only realm which is open to him is Malkuth, the plane which is his own, where Space is identical to his Essence , where the Containing is at t he same tim e the Contained , where the divine decision which wants Man to be i n the image of God comes true.. At his beginning, Archetypal Man occupied, managed and administer ed Malkuth. After his Fall, Malkuth, obscure and gloom y in part because of the preponderance of what wa s grasped by the “rebel Watchers”, became his prison, his sinking dro ss. Malkuth will become the Kingdom again, luminous and harmonious, where Ad am Kadmon will reign anew (like the well-known “Scottish” device: “Ordo ab C hao”...), in order to continue his eternal task. One way or another Malkuth remains t he Stone, first of all rough, then rough-hewn, then shaped, t he one philos ophical Great Work worthy of the Adept. * * * Now, if the bad Powers, having tr iumphed ov er Adam (this is the esotericism of the legend of Pandora), are the Regent s of Malkuth during the disgrace of Adam Kadmon (these are the mysterious Archons from the World of the Gnostics) , it is sensible to accept that after his Reintegratio n into his original Nat ure, these Regents will bec ome microcosmic reflections of the Adam Kadmon, that is to say the c onstituent cells of Archetypal Man – sublime and pure cells , which will have taken the place of the evil Powers who will have been finally chased from the Kingdom. - 55 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A.

The Greco-Latin Wo rld also suspected this deification of certain elements of Humanity with their cult of “heroes” and “demigods”. On the traditional side of this teachi ng of Martinez de Pasqually, we limit ourselves to citing the Kabbalah, whic h was his principal doctrinal source. Attributing each of the nine celest ial choirs to the nine superior Se phiroth, in the capacity of regents and residents both at the same time, it gives the tenth choir to Malkuth – that of the Glorified Souls (see both Agripp a, and J.- B. Heptburn in his “Verga Aurea” 28 ) Who are these Glorified Souls , but those who the diverse religions have vitalized to the point of creating (by means of an often multi-secular type of cult of dulia 29 )true little egregores , themselves constituting a great col lective egregore , which Stanislas de Guaita, in hi s work “The Serpent of Genesis” calle d “ The Great Communion of Saints ”. In his “ Occult Philos ophy ” Cornelius Agrippa devoted a chapter in his third book to the “ Anim astic Order ” – that of the Fortunate a nd Glorified Souls. He counsels the student of the High Sciences t o commit hi mself by preference to these beings, which are of the human race like him, and infinitely more understandable, because they are nearer to us than the strange other beings which people the Invisible Cosmos. Without doubt all ar e cr eatures of God, but there is a familial, racial tie bet ween Man and these Souls wh ich, beyond the grave, l ink the Living to the D ead mo re surely and more naturally than that which exists between Man and the Angels. This is the origin of the patron saints of Christianity. If we consider Malkuth, the “Kingdom” of Man, as a reflec tion of the entire Kabbalistic Tree (itself the whole of Creation), we must take into consideration that it contains the reflection of each of the other Sephiroth. And the biblical Tradition in effe ct divides the legendary epoch of the World into two periods, each with ten patriarchs, each corresponding to one of the Sephirotic spheres. 28 Verga Aurea (Latin): the G olden Wan d - PV. 29 In Roman Catholic ism dulia is the hon or give n to ang les an d sai nts - PV. - 56 - "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"R.

The doctrine of the Rose+Cross counsels pr acticing the Religion of the country in which one presently finds ones elf, as all are worthwhile in their intent. In fact, this is the best means of using the collec tive egregore generated by the local cult. As the El us Cohen is a Western Theurgic Order, the Western Tradition is thus its animator and its channel. This explains the apparent Judeo-Chris tian character of it s ceremonies, both in the “Grades” and in the theurgic Operations. From that ti me, in imitation of the Catholic Church whic h substituted the pagan gods by Saints with parallel legends and benefic attributions, Martinez de Pasqually replaced the magical “Nam es” of the Angels and Geniuses by Names of Patriarchs, Apostles, Prophets, Disciples and also the great Angel and Archangels accept ed by the Roman lit urgy. The planetary and zodiacal “seals”, emblematic of the invisib le in telligen ces and sid ereal daim ons are still used – as we shall see later – for interpreting the luminescent “passes” by which the passed Entities, thus evoked by the Réau-Cr oix, manifest their sympathy with the equinoctial “Work” of the Operator. As a matter of fact, this Magic, par ticularly that of Martinez de Pasqually, is vaguely necromantic, since it calls to the deceased in place of cosmic Intellige nces. Yet the church also honors the dead on its altars, so one should find it no more reprehensible to call upon a Saint or Apostle at midnight on the spring or autumnal equ inox, than at any other hour in a chapel, priv ate oratory or a parish church. On the whole, the “angels” of the Gr imoires, and the “spirits” of the Keys of Solomon are rather more susp ect!

The fact of substituting entities fr om the Christian “heaven” for those or pagan or gnostic pantheons is no so audacious. The Kabbalists of the XV th Century, had (already ) established t he analogical corres pondenc es between the two modes of occult classification. Cornelius Agrippa, in the third book of his “Occult Philosophy ”, devot ed a whole chapter to the “ Anim astic Order ” or choir of Glorified Souls . In this ch apter, as w e sa w earlier, he assures us that the student of the Higher Sciences has ev ery interest in dedicating himself to those invisible beings of human origin, rather than enter into a relationship with extra-human intelligences which, bot h naturally and through original divine intention, have no place nor connection with Man. In his “V erga Aurea”, the monk J.-B. Heptburn in his tu rn tells us of this equivalence, and the correspondences c oming from them. Now, according to common Traditi on, the magic Circle should cont ain an indic ation of the constituent elements of the Time of the Operation, the Space being defined ipso facto by the circle. In the opposite case the Time factors are omitted, and the Operation is rea lized at the end of an undefined longer or shorter peri od of time, since Fate alone, t hat is to say the physical Stars of the Cosmos, will be its promoter. It is thus that the old authors on these matte rs tell us th at the magi c circle should include: 1) The name of the Hour of t he Operations (Kabbalistic name); 2) The name of the Angel of the Hour; 3) The Seal of the Angel of the Hour; 4) The Seal of the Angel of the Da y and of the Minist er of the Day; 5) \t The name of the current Time (K abbalistic name of the Earth for the Season); 6) The name of the Spirits whic h preside over the Operation; 7) The name of the reigning Sign (at mid-heaven); 8) The name of the Sun and Moon at this epoch; 9) The name of the Angels of the Air for this day; 10) A Pentagram at each cardinal point; 11) Alpha and Omega, in the inner area.

We also believ e a priori , that a miracle wrought by a living or dead saint is only secondary proof. As a stronger answer, selection by the Church is not sufficient to justify the “sanctity” of a histori c personage, whose way of life would not satisfy the moralist and philosopher, and the Christian theologian at the same time . In this we allude to Charlemagne, accused of multiple inc est by his chroniclers, and to Dominic Gusman or Ignatius Loyola, whose memory is more than tarnished by fanaticism, and cruel and murderous intolerance. - 62 - "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"R.

The “P asses” The active side of the Theurgy of the Elus Cohen consisted by the Operations of exorcism, t he purification of the Earth’ s aura. The passive side of this Theurgy consisted of the obt aining of “passes”, the appearance of luminous glyphs or many different ty pes, which carried to the Operator a tangible manifestation of the celestial Power s evoked outside of the Operating Circle, and whose pres ence was brought into concrete form through the symbolic wax candles, true luminous “effigies”. The interpretation of these passes is achiev ed by means of a collection of 2,400 names and hier oglyphic characters, sent to Réaux-Croix by Martinez de Pasqually himself. The collection of Prunel de Lierre is currently preserved in the Library at Grenoble. One might think at first that the these glyphs wer e invented by the Master himsel f. This is not the case.

This Arcana would give a definitive response open to an strongly esoteric interpretation, such as those given by Christian in his “Homme Rouge des Tuiler ies” and in his “History of Magic”. One sees that the system of “passes”, peculiar to Elus Cohen, constitutes the upper ground of Mantic 36 . These responses emanate directly from the Invisible, without a single material go-between, without any other channel 36 Prophe cy, according to Me rriam’ s Dictionary - PV. - 64 - "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"R.

One must believe that the legitima cy of this occult “communication”, through luminous seals, was already tr aditional knowledge, since Rembrandt, more than a Century before Martinez de Pasqually and his disciples, shows us “Dr. Faustus” the philos opher in one of his admirable etchings, wearing a Phrygian bonnet (symbol of spiritual li beration) and contem plating – at once fascinated and terrified – the pantacle which suddenly appears before him in his laborat ory, and which is shown to him by a mysterious hand, shining in a “glory”...

Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) Conclusion We believe that by the preceding, we have sufficiently established the cogency of the Theurgy of the Elus Cohen which, in according with the doctrine of “Reintegrati on”, gave the pre-eminent patronage to the superior elements of Humanity, who are already reintegrated in the bosom of the Archetype, over the extr a-human entities peop ling the Worlds of the Beyond. Thus, in accord with the Western Tradi tion, in the mysterious “Kingdom” promised to All Man, he had originally been conc eived and emanated by t he Creator God: the “King”. Our work w ould be inc omplete if, in concluding, we did not underline the immense spiritual and moral superiority of the Réaux-Croix of Martinez over the crowd of Sorcerers’ Apprentices and Magicians through the ages: for their aim was true. The assi stance of the Beyond was only solicited to obtain a certain material or sensual result. Their sole desire was (with the “Veil” raised for a mo ment on the other world) to ca tch a glimpse of the Gates of celestial Jerusalem, that fabulous “City of Beatitudes” in an eternal dawn... Theu rgic Pan tacle THE RITUAL OF THE ELUS COHENS From an examination of documents which have come to us (correspondences, rituals, sayings, et c...) it appears that the Ritual of the Elus Cohen was completely the work of Martinez de Pasqually himself. There is no evidence that, from the st art of his enterprise, he had been in possession of any traditional documents, which he then developed. On the contrary, it appears that, over time, he brought his own modifications to his original system. In fact, these mo difications only affe cted the exterior “fo rm” of these Rites, so could be considerable without having any real importance. It is more particularly so for the “Operat ive Cir cles”. On the subject of these latter, we w ould point out that histori ans of the Order have often been quite confused between the Circles destined fo r ordination in to the various grades of the Order, and those Circl es destined for Theurgic Operations. The former were purely symbolic, while the second wer e active Ritual elements. - 66 - "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A.

The marks O ∴ V 39 which you will find in this paper indicates that it is the same Word you must repeat. This is what I have done. As to the manner of using this Daily Invocation , this is what the Ma ster charged me to tell you. He permi ts you to trace as single Circle, having in the centre the “W” 40 and a star or candle. You may have another one in your hand in order to read your paper. This Invocation can be performed every day, at any time, at any hour, if you wish. You asked if you are in fact permitt ed to trace the conventional “arbitrary” Signs (N.B. Signs chosen by the Celebrant in a special Ritual), as described at the end of the af orementioned Invocation. The Master has not instructed me about this.

This cannot be said about the other “batteries” – I think that thos e of the “8 – 1” must not be changed at all, because it contains a double pow er in itself, which is absolutely not in the disposition of Man to ch ange (battery of nine blows, by 8 and 1). 42 <Points 2) and 3) omitted> 7) \t In reducing the 98 Candles to 17, it is only a question of the Candles for the Circl es, and not the Circles of Correspondence nor the “Vautours 43 ”.

His mother having died a short time after his birth, he was raised by his step-mother and father, both strongly pious people. He pursued his studies at the College of Pont-Levoy. Destined for the “robe”, he studied law, and quickly became a barrister in the courts at Tours. This profession, with all it included in t hose times, with its worries and idle pettifogging, quickly disappointed him and, on a recommendation from the Duke of Choiseul, a friend of his father, he received an Officer’s Commission with the Regiment of Foix shortly after leaving t he Courts of Justice. He was garrisoned at Bordeaux, and it was there that he m ade the acquaintance of another officer in this regiment, M. de Grainville, who was affiliated with the Order of Elus Cohe n, which had just been founded by Martinez de Pasqually. This officer initiated him into the Doctrine of the Order, and his innate mysticism and a certain predispos ition for theologica l studies and hig h hermetic speculation , filled him with enthus iasm, and in October 1768 he was rit ually initiated. In the letters of Martinez de Pasqually, notably that of 13 th August, 1768, he was “Monsieur de Saint-Martin”, whereas one finds him jo ined up with the “T.P.s” (Thrice Potent Masters, ritual formula) de Grainville and de Balzac. But in another letter dated 2 nd October in the same year, he is “Mast er Saint-Martin”. He has therefore received the three first Degrees of blue masonry, called “Saint John”, and he was without doubt on the w ay to enteri ng into the famous Porch Class. Whatever the majority of historians may say about it, all his letters prove that Saint-Martin “operated” the rites of Ceremonial Hi gh Magic according to the instructions of his Master Pasqually, and had the expect ed results. He saw the “passes”, felt the afflictions announcing t he present of “La Chose”, and later on, he never denied thes e results. But if the doctrine he had receiv ed, th is young officer of the Regiment of Foix and s ecretary of the Mast er for several years, marked him for the rest of his life with a real and indelible spirit ual impr int, he only shows littl e interest for the “manifestations” of the Beyond, indeed, even a certain mistrust as to their moral benefit. Those who ac cuse him of fear , such as Bricaud in his “Account of Martinism” or various authors, commit an error. Saint-Martin had scrupulous ly observed the occult customs and secret ce remonies of the Réaux-Croix for more than six years. Did thi s fear come to him so late on? No. Yet his mystical orientation changed. Saint-Martin was a pure speculat ive, and the operative side of both Mystical and Cohen Masonry impeded him. And aroun d 1775, at the time of the - 78 - "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) appearanc e of his first work, the treatise “O f Errors And Of Trut h”, this evolution had already been going on for a year. And from 1777, during his s tay in Versailles, he tried to l ead his Cohen Brethr en into pure mysticism. It was also three years since Marti nez de Pas qually had died in Port-au-Prince. * * * Saint-Martin only had a little success among the Elus Cohen. Whether they retained a profound admiration for t he memory of the disappeared Master (which is very probable ), or whether they fel t it repugnant to confide in someone whom some of them perceived to be their junior, Saint-Martin failed in the bosom of the Order. But if he lost interest i n that route , what is sure is that he demonstrated perseverance! Next he brought his effo rts to bear in the different arena of hermetic societies, and esoteric areopagi. The XVIII th Century was generally materialist, “libertine” in the obsolete s ense of the word. Our new adept went to try to convert them; and it was through hi s series of books, and his success in the wider world, where all the noble ladies who agonized over t he afterlife and the problems of the soul, and of God, that he was given a welcome full of goodwill. Saint-Martin had had noble lady-friends and sweethearts. But if hi s fame among women was greater than among men, these fr iendships were based upon nobly spirit ual sentiments, with nothi ng gross or base to tarnish them. Nevertheless, having been taught in a disciplinarian school where one knew what one wanted, and where one worked more than one talked, Saint- Martin had to try to realize his dr eam which had been halted by the lack of confidence in him from the Elus Cohen. So he turned towards men, and created a spiritual movement based upon Christ ian esotericism. Understanding by intuition as well as experience that nothing survives over time without encountering obstacles, except that wh ich is hidden (“to live happy, live in secret!”), he created his school under an esoteric and secret umbrella. During one of his journeys to Strasbour g, (a town whic h was part of his life, along with Paris and Amboise – if one exc ludes th e journeys abroad – and which he later called his “paradise”), Saint-Martin made the acquaintance of Rodolphe de Salzmann, a translator and commentator on the mystical German philosopher, Jacob Boehme. Now, coming out of the “B rothers of the East”, a in itiatic order constituted in Constant inople in 1090 under the patronage of Emperor Alexis Comnenus, a secret mystic fraternity grouped together the adepts of a Rosi crucian school of the evangelical and protestant type.

Farewell, dear Brother, give my greet ings to your family, and to all the Brethren, both spiritual and temporal. Ora pro nobis. * * * One sees by the terms used in this letter, nevertheless, the importance which Saint -Martin attached to his firs t initiation, which he had received from Martinez de Pasqually. He quit everythi ng, for Masonry was to him nothing more than a burden, yet nevertheless he was anxious to remain a Réau-Croix in soul and spirit, faithful to the Brethr en and holding them in his heart... From his entry into the secular m ystic order, he always devoted himself completely to his new apostolate. The journeys began. Here a point of history and chronology comes in. When exactly did he enter into a relationship with Salzmann, and when was he received, according to the rites, “ beneath the Mantle, the Mask and the Cordelier”?... Many years previously... In fact, his first journey to London wa s in January, 1787. He stayed there until July, and he set off again soon afterwar ds, in September, for Italy, in the company of Prince Galitzin. In February, 1788, he returned to Lyon. His other journeys, both to Sweden and Den mark, are less certain. Only the verbal tradition of his “Intimates” c onfirms them. Similarly the journey to Russia is even more d oubtful. It is more likely that Prince Galitzin, who was o ne of the disciples of the “U nknown Philosopher” who later achieved the diffusion of the mysticism of Saint-Martin later, among the affiliate s of the :Strict Observance”.

But from the large number of accounts it is hard to say whether that of the Elus C ohen were manifested in them at all. Without doubt none of the rituals of Freemasonry were attached. Th is makes sense, since the “Society of Unknown Philos ophers ” existed long before the Grand Lodge of London had been founded, and more than fifteen lustres 48 in Time separated them...But for those led to study the two Rituals, that of the “Knight Elus Cohen of the Universe” and that of the “Unknown Super iors”, the exterior “form” of the rite of Saint- Martin, with its outdated archaism and its XVIII th Century French, is shot through with Cohen themes! There was a single diffe rence, important despite everything: the Order of Saint-Martin opened its Wo rks “To the Glory of the Uncreated Word”, whereas the Elus Cohen opened thei rs with “To the Glory of the Grand Architect of the Universe”. From 1829, in another letter which Joseph Pont, a friend and spiritual inheritor of J.-B. Willer moz, addressed to the Senator of Metz, J.-F. von Mayer, we find an allus ion to the possibility of an initiation to a superior Elu-Cohen grade which Saint -Martin had transmitted to Gilbert, his close friend. Besides, the Comte de Gleichen wrote in his “Souvenirs” that he had become the disciple of the “Unknown Ph ilos opher” in a secret school opened by Saint-Martin in Paris (who had ev en transmitted the affiliation of Elu s Cohen to him in 1779). Finally, in some notes, dated from Paris on 20 th December, 1795, and which were addressed, by a correspondent who sadly remains anonymous, to the Professor of Theology Köster de Göttingue, and also publis hed by a German periodic al of the time, i t appears that t here effectively existed a “Society of Intimates o f Saint-Mar tin” or “Society of Saint-Martin”, more distantly called “provincial branch of the Society of Sain t-Martin of Strasbur g”. In the names cited in these notes, one finds various Elus Cohen, probably those few disciples of Martinez de Pasqually who followed Saint -Martin, and a some minor German princes.

According to the Marquis François de Chefdebien de Saint-Armand (the famous “Franciscus Eques A Capite Galeat o”), Knight-Beneficent of the Holy City from the work of Benjamin Fabre...), we know that Martinez de Pasqually, before repairing to Saint-Domingue, had desig nated a successor and five “Unknown Superiors” of the Order of Elus C ohen, who were: Bacon de La Chevalerie, Louis-Clau de de Saint -Martin, J.-B. Willermoz, de Serre, Duroy d’Hauterive, de Lusignan. This is report ed to us by Prince Chri stian of Hesse, a Knight- Beneficent himself, and member of the “Society of Saint-Martin” in Strasbourg, in his letter to the Senator of Frankfurt-a m-Main, Metzler, Grand-Profès of the “Knights-Beneficent”, and thus linked to the Elus Cohen by the Wi llermoz branch. From 1821, this type of initiation, from man to man, was known . We find that Varuhagen con Euse, in his Preface for Rahel’s work (“Angelus Siles ius and Saint-Martin”) tells us that: “He (Saint-Martin) soon decided to found a society...But the foundation of this so ciety was only effected slowly; he only accepted a few members and used great prudence...T he new soc iety seems to me to have had in the beginning t he form of a regular masonic Lodge .

DE SAINT-MARTIN The mystery school founded by Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, like that which he joined after leaving the Elus Co hen, even if it continued to spread the general teachings of Martinez de Pasqually, nevertheless repudiated its magical “Operations”. Saint-Mart in considered that this type of practice could be dangerous for the mental equilibrium of adepts, and could lead to them to errors in religious matters. It would therefore appear useful to us to define this “interior path” which he sanctioned in plac e of the theurgic way, and whic h is really the simple mystical asceticism of the Wester n Christian, known in the East under the name of “B hakti Yoga” , or y oga of devotion and adoration. * * * No one organism can possess the channel of all Truth. We are almost always infirm or ill in some manner, and, precisely, one of these possible infirmities becomes an assistance for the superior faculties of the soul. In fact, the psychopathic character possesse s emotionality, which is the sine qua non of moral perception. He possesses intensity, that inclinat ion which is so essentia l to the practice of moral vigor; and he possess es a love of metaphysics and mysticism, which elev ates our concern abov e t he surface of the sensual world. So it is not surprising that this temperament, apparently unfortunate to the ordinary materialist, is very suitable for intr oducing us to the “s piritual realms” of the universe – or the closed corners of religious truths – which the nervous system of common ma n, being ignorant or h ostile to this, has never attained. In fact, if an “i nspiration” coming from the higher realms occurs, it is probable th at a nervous emotional temperament is the key element of receptivity that it requires. Besides, these preliminary remarks are relevant to all manifestations of the Invisible, and equally for those phenome na called mystic union, in which the soul normally claims to be in direct communi cation with God. - 86 - "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"R.

It is necessary t hat all exponents of su ch special knowledge make known the inherent perils of psychic experiences, and above all of practicing ceremonial magic Operations. Truly, such operations are periods of contact with occult Forces, which are not approached without certain danger. One should also be wise only to enter into rel ations with metaphysical Entities – interior or exterior – with extreme prudence.

It is necessary then equally to env isage how this mystical experienc e links to that activity called “subconscious”, and whether this explains it partly or completely. Let us specify that the wo rd “subconscious ” is used to designate phenomena which seem governed by an intellig ent psychic activity, completely other to the personal conscious ness of the subject, and which, sometimes emerging into this person’s cons ciousness, seems to belong to a foreign personality. * * * The events of mystic union thus clearly defined, are sometimes called phenomena of perfect contemplation , where suspension of natural reactions is complete – as opposed to phenomena of imperfect contemplation , where the mystic sta te is yet not sufficiently a ccentuated to absorb the entire soul – and drives out all distractions which ar e irrelevant to the main busines s. Perfect contemplation consists of three states : simple union, ecstatic union, and transforming union. In having t hese clearly defined, superior states of soul, the mystical state manifests itse lf in the soul through supernatural contemplation, and through t he instinctive orison of t he mystic, called “silence” ( de quietude ). It is moreover proper to note that an outward faintness of consciousness accompanies the mystical state, because in the superior state of transforming union this event does not ordinarily occur, and we have proved this with a subject who enjoyed his interior contemplation (at any rate this is what he told us), while all his faculties remained clear and left hi m able to attend to active business. In the unfolding of the mystic st ate, one might observe the following stages. The soul feels invaded little by little by a forei gn personality, which imposes itself upon his attention and his love. It is similar to a disciple come to hear a famous master. A sympathetic person prepares for his comi ng, and gains a better understanding of the explanation of his doctrine! The master then appears, and those among the audienc e who love him understand him best, and he reveals himself best to them. Little by little the spirit of the disciple is penetrated by this personality which inv ades him, until he for gets the exigenc ies of exterior necessities . Hanging on the lip s of his master, he allows himself be absorbed in admiration, vener ation, even love, for him who holds him thus under a “spell” (in the occult sense of the word...) - 88 - "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"R.

These points, thus analyzed, pos e three problems to the rationalist who encounters them. Firstly, that of their passive or igin, since they arise before personal conscious ness as a vital act, yet rece ived and endured, rat her than produced and caused. Next, that of their psychological m echanism, in which one must separate the affective and cognitive aspects, in order to show that it is not at all m orbid , to exp lain their value and their nobilit y, and transcendence affirmed by the subjects, of an understanding without images , a pure and ideal comprehens ion (if one takes their assertions at face value). Additionally , psychology totally accords with the mystic that this internal force which leads him is definitely not his conscious will (as affirmed by him); that this intellig ence whic h directs his life is not his own reflected intelligence. His states, fro m that time , are truly manifestations of a pow er external to his higher conscious ness, and the progressive realization in him of an interior god, who possesses him, penetrates him, transforms him...But this god, who is only an interior god, is the tantric Ydam 49 , the “interior divin e”.

From the preponderance of thi s affective base, ascendant over all other in stincts, we can conclude that mystical affectivity is the superior manifestation of a vital and instinctive impulse, of which analogical reverie is the first symptom. * * * To tell the truth, the m ystic cannot furnish a ratio nalist critic with a single piece of evidential proof that it truly co mes from a transcendent God. In reality the mystic affirms this pres ent Being, which he calls God, through intuition; in a vision, or rather by means of an in tellectual understandi ng without images; through a manner of knowing which transc ends all attempts at explanation in a human way . Moreover, trying to explain it results in an impasse. The mystic translating his cognitiv e, intellectual sensations is then obliged to use completely improper terms to try to define them. Fro m this arises the affectation, the archaic sentimentality, and also the equivocations reminiscent of Freud, which one notes among the majority of them. Despite this, let us make a distin ction for the mystic relevant for an esoteric school, wher e the appetite for knowledge dominates the appetite for love. For the mystic Christian, it is the latter factor which always dominates. But if we truly wish to trust a pos ition between the two, and admit to mystical knowledge without demanding a demonstration (and these “scientific” demonstrations are often more illusor y than the fact in question...) , we will nevertheless have a few precious details. “Mystical contemplation, “ St. John of the C ross tells us, “is so simple, so spiritual, so general, that intellig en ce re ceives it without being enve loped in any type of image or representation capabl e of being receiv ed through the senses.” 50 “When the Most High God wishes to visi t a soul, sometimes it is given the favor of seeing Him. It s ees Him in itself, without cor poreal form, yet more clearly than a mortal man sees another. The eyes of the soul experience a spiritual plenitude which I cannot describe, since words and imagination have no powe r to express it ...” says St. Angela of Foligno 51 . “The soul knows God in its own heart, and sees him as it were more clearly than it sees material light with physical eyes.

Such is the conc lusion of another mysti c, Alvarez de Paz 52 . “How can it be that the soul has seen and heard while s he 53 has been in God and God in her, since during this union she neither sees nor hears? I would reply that she doesn’t see at that tim e , but that she sees it clearly afterwards, when she has returned into herself. And she knows, not through the vision, but through a certainty which lingers, whic h God alone can give her...”, so Saint Theresa of Avila tells us. Might one thereby conclude that patient study, acquired esoteric knowledge, and elementary philos ophical tr aining might offer a more concrete means of translation for the mystic following in Sa int-Martins’ footsteps? When the soul has again returned to itself, as Sa int Theresa of Avila explained, it is the special “grace: from this metaphysical dom ain, formerl y hidden to it, which allows it to shine! And if the superior state attained during the course of his union with the divine is the same for all mystics, it is no less true that for our “il lumined ones” there can remain a ray, a durable spark, a glowing em ber wh ich a llows him to reenter that state more easily in future. One like the other has been the object of the same interior phenom enon, but in the manner of two listener s at the same concert, where one has no auditory memory, whereas the other possess ed it. In this second listener then, no doubt imperfectly, but in part, he can r eplay the concert as many times as he wishes... “The soul,” so Saint John of the C ross tells us, “sometimes appears to be more God than soul...” . For Saint-Martin, “Man is a thought of God...”. Identical express ion at heart, and in their agr eement with the mechanism of high mysticism. * * * In this brief study of the superior states of the soul, and of the potential access that they hold to the inaccessible “spiritual regions” forbidden to ordinary men, we believ e that the mystic sc hool and the teachings propagated by Louis- Claude de Saint-Martin wonderfully comple ment the theurgic school and doctrinal purity founded by Martinez de Pasqually. Ea ch completes the other. And if we were to allow that Man could or should di sas sociate himself from his like, these two would constitute the ideal school for that which is called Initia tion. But that is not the case. The traditional teaching is prec ise: Man is but a link of a chain which surrounds the whole of Humanity.

I am even inclined to think that M. de Pasqually, w hom you mention, and who, since it must be said, was our Master, had the “active Ke y” to all that our friend Boehme lays out in his theories, but did not think that we w ould be in a state to handle such high truths.

But we had har dly begun to walk in step together before he was taken from us by death. “The result of all this, is that there is an excellent marriage to be made between our first School and our friend Boehme. This is what I am working at , and I openly confess to you that I find the tw o spouses so well matched that I know nothing more perfect. I will help you all I can.” One sees that the theory, dear to ce rtain members of hi s Society or over- hasty historians, that Saint-Martin was completely detached from the theurgic teachings of Martinez de Pasqually, is erro neous. Saint-Martin tried to raise this teaching to a clearly higher level, and, in s hort, to put forward the theory that hi gh Mysticism is able to direct, control and to explain the tangib le manifestations obtained through the Theurgy of the Réaux- Croix. * * * He took a great deal of interest in th is control of the Mystic over vulgar Theurgy, and defined it quite well: “Those who delight in their soul being in a fallen state”, he said, “ and who known not the way of the Higher Sphere – to which we belong as of primitive right – accept the empire of astral Inte llig en ces, and place themselves in rap port with them.

Not a ll is error in these practices, but one must beware all of them, fo r they all occur in a “p lace” where both Good and Evil are confused and blended.” Howev er, our Mystic does not intend to give Theurgy too important a role, still less the pagan theurgy whic h he condemned in his preceding letter, and limits himself to divine manifestations through pure material interest.

Hence my future writi ngs sha ll s peak much of that “central initiation” which, through our union with God, can teach us all we ought to know, and very little of the descriptive anatomy of thos e delic ate points on which would have me give my opinion. “Regarding the means of the quickest union of our will with God, I will say that this union is a work which can only be accomplished through the firm and constant resolution of those who desire i t; that there is no other way than the perseverin g action of a pure will, nourished by works and practice of every vi rtue, expanded by prayer, so t hat divine grace may come to help our weakness, and lead us to the time of our Regeneration. “So you see that what I might say to the public about this, would surely receive no more credit than the divine word does! “On the uni on of the Original with the Copy, I will say that, in spiritual Operations of all kinds, this effect ought to appear both natural and possible to you, since images, being related to their Originals, must a lways tend towards them. This is the Road t hat all theurgic Operations take, where the Names of Spirits, their Signs, Characters, and ever ything which c an be related to them and which can have a relationship with them, are employed. (One can see from this that Saint -Martin does not completely condemn Theurgy in general, which would be contrary to his own beliefs, and that he only condemns that which is all too oft en confused with ordin ary Magic, and advertised under the name of “Hi gh Magic”!...). “As to your question about the aspect of Light, or the elemental Flame, and how to obtain the virtues which are its Or iginals, you must see that all this is absolutely Theurgic, above all in that Theurgy which us es elementary nature, and, as such, I believe it to be useless and alien to our true Theurgy , where the only flam e needed is that of our desire, no other light than that of our purity . “Nevertheless, that does not prev ent your drawing the most profound knowledge from Boehme about Fire and its correspondences! There you will find enough to repay your speculations...” In this vein, Saint-Marti n is a Kabbalist . Certainly not in the manner of many Kabbalists, who are content to r ead and re-read vain books. He went far further than them. He allied material asceticism (alimentary diet, etc.) with intellectual asceticism (choice of readi ng, nature of medi tations), and all this preparation put him in t he centre of a sufficie nt purity that one day, Spirit (which - 94 - "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"R.

And the only active part (his theurgy) whic h he brought to all this was Knowledge, whic h gave him knowledge of the best “prayers” and “divine names” (which he studied extens ively ) to facilitate and hasten this Gra ce , visitor to the Sages, the divine Shekinah , the gnostic Sophia . The profane have always passed quickly ov er this inventory of his mystical arsenal. And yet...! Saint-Martin i nnovated nothing... .If we closely read the Hebrew or Christian Kabbalists, we conc lude that spiritual meditation on the elements (those of the Kabbalistic “Schem a”, the Sephiroth, etc.), are always accompanied by corollaries in rapport wit h the rules and man ner of life, the ambiance of the Kabbalists, the propitious times for divine Prayers, and the traditional and sacred knowledge of the Divine Names, the “Words of Power”, through which Man recollects having been, in another world, the reflection of he Divine Word . THE “INNER WAY” OF CLAUDE DE S AINT-MARTIN The “sense of the divine” is mainly expressed through religious emotion and by means of the rites, ceremonies and sacrifices from which it flows. It reveals its highest expression in Prayer. “The holy men of G od”, the Kabbalistic traditions informs us, “when they wish to walk the Thirty-Two Roads of Wisdom, begin by meditating on the sacred verses, and thus prepare themselves first by means of holy prayer.” But Prayer, like the “sense of the divine” which it expresses, is evidently a spiritual phenomenon; and as Dr. Carrel judiciously notes, the Spiritual World remains beyond our modern exp erimental techniques. How then may we obtain a positive underst anding of Prayer? The scientific domain fortunately comprises all that is observable; and this domain, through the intermediation of Physiology, can extend to manifestations of the Spiritual. So it is through a systemati c observation of man at prayer, that we can learn what comprises the phenom enon of Prayer, its me thod of production, and its effects 54 . In fact, Pra yer represe nts the attempt by Man to commune with all incorporeal or metaphysical entities: anc estors, guides, saints, archetypes, gods, etc...or with the First Cause, at the summi t of the preceding py ramid. Far from being a vain and monotonous recitation of formulae, true Prayer represents a “mystical state” for man, a state in wh ich his conscious ness comes together with the Absolut e. This state is not of an intellectual nature; if also remains inaccess ible and even incomprehensible to the philosopher and expert. In order to pray, it is necessary to make th e effort to strain towards the Divinity. “Think of God more often than you breathe...” Epicte tus tells us. Very short mental invocation can keen man in the :presence” of God. 54 A.

Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) There is also another aspect of Prayer , and that its “constructive” role, acting in the “spiritual regions” where live the unknown or the unexplored. “Ore et Labore” said the ancient hermetic devic e, “pray and work”. Also, remember the popular adage: “to work is to pray”. Perhaps we may conclude in the same vein, that to pray is to work. All depends on what is implied behind this word. Perhaps the man who prays is constructi ng, in another world, this “glorious body”, this “body of light” referred to by the Manic heans, and which is his own “Celestial Jerusalem”; his “Divin e City”, his “Interior Tem ple”?... From this, one might suggest that the man who does not pray is not weaving his own immortality, and that he is depriving himself of a precious treasure. In this case, each of us will fi nd, “beyond deat h”, what, in his terrestrial life, he had hoped to find there. The atheist will vanish into Nothingness, and believers into another Life 55 . Psychologically, the “sense of the divine” appears to be an impulse from the depths of our nature, a fundamental action which is found among primitive and civilized people alike. Its varieties are linked to various other fundamental activities; notably moral sense, aesthetic sense, and personal will. The opposite is also true. And, as D r. Carrel observed, history shows us that a loss of morality and a sense of the sacred in the majority of the constituent elem ents of a nation, leads to its fall and its rapid ens lav ement by neighbouring peoples, who have preserved what they, through their own faul t, have lost. Illustrative examples include Greece, Rome, etc... Besides, man is a composite of or ganic tissues and liquids, penetrated by an imponderable element called Conscious ness. Now, the living body, sum of these organic tissues and liquids, has its own existenc e, linked by an exact correspondence to the causal Universe. Can we not then suppose that Conscious ness, if it lives in material organs, also extends at the same time outside of the physical continuum? Is it not possible to believe that we are immersed in a “Spiritual Universe” (by the fact of our Conscious ness), a universe we can no more do without, than our body of flesh can do without the Material Universe, from which it draws the el ements for its conservation: oxy gen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, for the perfo rmance of nutritive and respiratory functions? In this “Spir itual Universe” in whic h our Consciousness can draw on similar principles for its own conservation and moral “health”, is it forbidden to see the IMMANENT BEING, the First Cause, which ordinary religions call “God”? Certainly. Then Pray er can consequently be consider ed the instrument of a natural connection between our Conscious ness and its own environment , in the same way that respiration and nut rition is for the physical body. 55 Which doe s not necessa rily si gnify that the se con d alternative is b etter than the first. - 96 - "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"R.

Praying is the equivalent of a biological activity, dependent on our disposition, and is a normal, natural function of our spirit . To neglect it is to atrophy our very “principle”, in a word, our soul. Once again it is important to make a distinction! The recitation of silly formulae, repeated wit hout the spirit tr uly being present, where the lips alone have any real involvement, is not prayer! Remember that the interior man, w hich Claude de Saint-Martin called the “Man of Desire”, must be attentive, and bring what lips and brain conjoi ntly express to life! Joined to intuition, moral sense, aesthetic sense and intelligence, the “sense of the divine” gives a human pers on his bloom . Now, there is no doubt that success in life requires the maxi mum – and integrated – development of each of our physiological, intellec tual, affect ive and spiritual activities. Spirit is both Reason and Sentiment, and we must love Beauty and Knowledge as much as Moral Beauty, Form as well as Action. In this Plato was right when he told us that, in order to merit the name of ‘man’ , we should “have a child, plant a tree, write a book”. For Claude de Saint-Martin, if the “W ord” of the Absolute necessarily manifests in concrete form in a new “h ypostasis”, penetrating the causal world, then in turn it is possible for the “word” of realized Man to access the “Spiritual Universe”, when it is suitably lov ed and guided by his Higher Cons ciousness.

He entered apprenticeship at the age of fifteen, in an enterprise in the silk industry. From 1754, at tw enty-four years of age, acco rding to him, we find him established in Lyon. However, at the start he only has a r udimentary education, having left Trinity College at the age of twelve in order to help his father in business. Coming from a very Catholic family, as did L.-C. de Saint-Martin, all his life he retained a strongly marked religiou s imprint. From 1750 (so at this time he was twent y years old), we fi nd him affiliated to a Masonic Lodge at Lyon (historic documents have not allowed us to discover the name of this Lodge). This fact is not surprizing, giv en the period. In the 18 th Century Masonic Lodges were fr equented by very honourable people, and whether they be Protestant or Catholic, they were sincer e believ ers; when they came from the “deists” of t hat time, these were all also religious people. But their mysticism was poured out in the domain of occult sciences: Hermeticism, alchemy, Kabbalah, etc... In 1752, we find Wille rmoz installed as Vene rable Master of his Lodge, when the predecessor of this young Ma son had left Lyon. Wearyi ng of the somewhat banal “atmosphere” of this Lodge – whose name is unknown – the following y ear (1753) he f ounded another masonic obedi ence called “Parfait Amitié” (Perfect Friendship). He was elected Venerable Master on St. John’s Day, the 24 th of June, 1753. The Lodge quic kly flourished. Ten years later, around fifty silk manufacturers an d bourgeois of Lyon frequented the Lodge. From 1756, this Lodge was attached to a Mother-Lodge: the Grand Lodge of France, and the patents of r egularization for the “Parfa it Amitié” Lodge, dated 21 st November, 1756, is the oldest his torical document of Lyon Masonry of the Grand Lodge of France. In 1760, on the 4 th of May, the V enerable M asters of the following three Lodges: l’Amitié (20 members), la Parfaite Amitié (30 members) and les Vrais Amis (12 members) decided, in agr eement with the Grand Lodge of France, to 56 His nam e was origi nally written ‘Vuillerm oz’. - 98 - "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"R.

J.-B.- Willermoz, Jacques Grandon and Jean Paganucci, the three Vener able Masters in question, thus founded the “Grand- Loge des Maîtres-Réguliers de Lyon”. This Lodge quickly flouris hed. We discover that on the 24 th June, 1760, St. John’s Day in the Summer, in its lodgings in rue Saint-Jean, it has around fifty members. The number of southern Masonic Lo dges affiliat ed to and controlled b y this central body con tinued to grow. From 1762 to 1763, Willermoz wa s it s Grand Master. Later he became the Keeper of the Seals and it s Archivist. Yet to be an organizer of value, he was rather more a mystic smitten with esoteric knowledge than History has remembered. We see this a ffirme d twelve years later, in 1772, in his letter to Baron von Hund: “From my first admission into the (Masonic) Order, I have always been persuaded that it contained a possible goal which was capable of satisfying an honest man. Following this idea, I have worked without cease to discover it. One study lasted more t han twenty years, and a particularly strong correspondence extended with very educ ated Brothers, in France and abroad, regarding the deposit of Archives of the Order in Lyon, given into my care ten years ago, gave me the means. Thanks to these, I found a num ber of systems, each one more im portant than the other . Etc ...” 57 . Besides, Germany with its mystic environment would always be of marked interest to J.-B. Willer moz. So in 1762, we see him communicatin g, with Meunier de Précourt as intermediary, with the Vener able Master of the Lodge “la Vertu” in Metz. It was this Maso n who informed Willermoz that the Temple, apparently destroyed by the French monarchy and t he papacy, had survived, and that the Teutonic Knights had acquired its exoteric heritage, while the Rose-Croix had done the same with the esoteric heritage. This was, from a historical perspective, strongly subject to verification. One shoul dn’t be too surprized at this infatuation for the occult science s by a practicing Catholic like J.-B. Willermoz. His brother, Dr. Pierre-J acques Willermoz, a devotee of alchemy from the age of nineteen, was the student and friend of Dom Pernetty, the Benedictine who was at the f oundation of the “Illuminati of Avignon ”. This is why, in 1763, Jean-Baptiste Willermoz founded the “Sovereig n Chapter of Knights of the Black Eagle, Rose- Croix”. In this esoteric environment, there was no question that Hermeticism, Alchemy and Masonr y would colour the exterior ritual form. Truly, Christianity was always the directing id ea for Willermoz. But his Catholicis m would be considered heretical on a number of points. If he loved the Christ-God, it was as much as the Redeem er of fallen Humanity as the Initiate par excellence ; the “Glorious Word” which he later evoked, perhaps, in the bosom of the Areopagi of the Elus-C ohen; he whom pagan antiquity certainly 57 This app ears to confirm th e role of “p hilosophi cal catalyst”, or syn creti c age nt, played by Freem ason ry. - 99 -     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"R.

There he met with Bacon de la Chevalerie, Deputy for the Order of Elus Cohen, who spoke to him in hidden terms of the doctrine of its perpetrator, Don Jaime Martinez de Pasqually ... He did not go into the Order with closed eyes, and his letter to his Brother dated 2 nd May of the same year, which is full of experienced scepticis m, demonstrates this.

From purely verbal traditions from the XVIII th Century to the present by the channel of his spiritual sons, we have come to know that the mystical theurgy belonged to the 3 rd Degree in a Order issuing from the “Rose + C roix”, which was composed of nine Degrees in all. In truth, nobody could reproach W illermoz for the sudden mystical fever which he manifested. Above all he passionat ely desired to find the supreme arcana concealed within the Symbolism of Fr eemasonry. Yet, both unsatisfied with the formulaic wor ds of the silk m anufacturers of Lyon, and not being as favored as his Brothers in the matter of apparitions, of the “passes”, he soon doubted himself and became dis couraged. First Claud e de Saint-Martin, then Masters Gr ainville and Champoléon, a ll Offic ers of the Regiment of Foix , consoled him with stori es of their expe riences. Being more gifted than him in magical matters, they possessed a certainty of the reality of the Beyond, and of the strange Beings which unfolded there in haunting pro cessions. And this is their letter dated September 30 th , 1770: \"As you see, we hold fast to the Order, and that despite all we could similarly object to in Don Martinez. Th is is because it was not Don Martinez - 100 - "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A.

We can only wish y ou the same happiness of which we enjoy\". The faith of Martinez of Pasqually ’s disciples thus kept Willermoz within the Order, despite his magical failures. Such cultivated gentlemen as Bacon De La Cheva lerie, the Marquis de Lus ignan, the Cheva lier d e Grainville , and the Marquis Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin , with their supple and luminous intelligenc e, reassured him of the reality of these “s piritual regions\" which the theurgic Rites taught to them by Don Martinez of Pa squally allowed them to penetrate. Moreover, all were living this special – half-mystical and half-magical – technique, and they had shining proofs of its effectiveness. And so due to these testimonies, J. -B. Willermoz remained... Let us note that later, when Willermo z becomes the persistent and faithful follower of the Doctrine of t he Elus -Cohen, this in turn proves that he was, in his turn, convinced of its occult reality, and this through the action of \"La Chose\" itself, the m ysterious Word; in its turn evoking others used by the adepts of the Order, yet which denoted that sa me “Occult Presence\" which haunted the Réau x-Croix, inspiring them, guiding them tel epathically towards the spiritual battle whic h must be waged, not only agains t the rebel Archons from the Beyond, but against the ever-growing materialism of their contemporaries. For the enigmatic presence which Saint-Martin called “the Unknown Philosopher”, which Willermoz calle d “the Agent” – all thes e names denote now and forever “La Chose”!... At the end of 1770, Claude de Saint-Martin l eft the army to dedicate himself completely to the Mystical Path. He then became the secretar y of Martinez and, for J.-B. Willermoz, all then became in finitely clearer. The Doctrine, commentaries, theurgic rites, all were clar ified by Saint -Martin duri ng the course of a regular correspondence between the two men. In 1772, Willermoz lea rned, through le tter from the “La Cande ur” Lodge in Strasburg, (letter of November 5 1772), of the existenc e of a German Obedience, as rich in the number of its Lodges as in t he quality of its mem bers. This was the “Strict Templar Observance”, supposedly founded by the “Unknown Superiors”, according to its Grand Master, Baron Hund. To tell the truth, if the l atter had learned of the real exis tence of the Order in this way, he could never have been in communication with any of its envoys! And the names that he later put forward to justify the origins of the “Strict Ob servance” turned out to be unknown to the aforementioned ‘Unknown Supe riors”! No matter. Ignorant of these facts, Willermoz was won o ver; the order, the impo rtance, the inner disc ipline, all s poke in favor of this new Masonry. In a letter date d December 14 th of the same year, he requested affiliatio n with the “S. O. T.”.

Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) But our man from Lyon, prudent and informed, did not throw himself headlong into this new environm ent! In a letter dated July 23 rd , 1773, he put forward conditions, specifying that his Brothers, the Masons of Lyon, would accept nothing contrary to the laws of “their Relig ion, o r to their duties as citizens and faithful subjects of the King of France” . In short, they do not intend to make financial payments to benefit the Mother-Lodge in Germany, nor to have the free disbursem ent of their own financ es question ed. So, if they accepted the German dignitaries as their superiors, it w as onl y in the matter of the high grades of the “Strict Observance”; for the regular mas onic “symbolic” grades, they intended to keep the Duc de Chartres, as did all Frenchmen, as their Grand Master and Superior. During this time, the “Strict Temp lar Observance” had become (1772, St. John’s Day , 24 th June) “The Scottish Reunited Lodges”, and Baron Hund replaced by Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick as Grand Master. In the same year, in September, Claude de Saint-Marti n came to visit with Willermoz. For three years, the two friends had maintained a very regular corresponden ce. Their friendship became even deeper during the c ourse of Saint-Martin’s year-long stay with Willermoz. It wa s there that the book, written by Saint-Martin under the pseudony m of the “U nknown Ph ilosopher”, entitled \"Of E rrors and Truth \", saw the light of day. If it is overall the work of Saint-Martin, it is incontestable that Willermoz colla borated, as an intelligent critic, as the work proceeded to be developed. It was Perish, a bookse ller, and himself an “Elu-Cohen”, who ensured its publication. Simultaneously our two men decided to operate the ceremonies of the Rite t ogether. But (as often happens) the theurgic Operations performed i n common did not give the des ired results. Saint-Martin, who was habitua lly more favored than Willermoz onl y reaped “a very marked rejection in the spiritual order”. Doubtless, Marti nez had not taught them the necessity of unity, ternary, or quinary for the practice of High or Low Magic! In tradition the binary is absolutely proscribed: Oper ators must always mu st be in odd numbers (“Numerus impare gaudet”...). Be that as is may, little by little t he results, however mediocre they were, gave birth to a certainty in Willer moz (which grew with the months) that the Doctrine of Martinez of Pasqually was the reflection of a metaphysic al truth . And thus Willermoz became a zealous Réau-Cr oix. Nevertheless, he did not lose sight of ordinary Freemasonry. Less well gifted than others in internal illuminati on, meditation, and more able to judge facts than ideas , he was equally conv inced that this esoteric Doctrine – precisely because it was a truth , metaphysical and religious – must be reflected in Freemasonry itself in the same way as a ll cults and initiatic schools, which reveal but distorted reflections, modified by the times or the prevailing clim ate. His active and organizational temperament, and his love of perfection, order and - 102 - "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martini sme (19 46) Tran slate d by Piers A. Vaughan (200 2) minutiae, led him to search in Masonry for that which had been taught to him: an adaptation of the secret teachings of his Master Pasqually. This is the reason he did not wav er in his intentions regarding the “Strict Observance”, and between August 11 th and 13 th Baron Weiler, came fro m Germany to Lyon, especially to found the Lyons Obedience of t he “S. O. T.”, ordained a nd instituted the new member s that Willermoz had recruited from among regular Masons, t hen left on November 7 th of the same year, leaving the Scottish Rectified Lodge “La Bienfaisance” to fly with it s own wings! It is above all with regard to the Strict Observance t hat Willermoz himself fell out (for the first time and besides only momentari ly...) wit h his friend Claude de Saint-Martin... In fact Willermoz was plann ing a nother secret project in his head. Already, the invisible Powers (which lead Initiates in all ages, whatever one might believe...), had perceived the outward conc lusion of the Order o f the “Knights Elus-Cohen of the Universe”, and a new route for the doctrine was chosen. In his October letter dated the 12 th , 1781, later on, Willermoz exp laine d this plan that “La Chose” had whispered to him, without which he might have doubted himself, perhaps; and to the Landgrave of Hesse he revealed his intention as follows: “I am daring to develop a plan for it (the “Templar Strict Observance”) to be less in my country, and as one of its guides , to make use of th e “lights” that I had receiv ed elsewhere (in the or der of the Elus Cohen)...” In fact, his biographers have noted that the years when he propagated the German M asonic Rite of “S trict Observ ance” were those in which he most faithfully accomplishes his Réau-Croix rites. All the prescri bed Operations, such as the rite of the “Three Days” (for the “waxing moon”), the daily rites of invocation, and the Grand Equinoctial C onjurations, saw him (like all his Brothers), i n the center of the Magic Circles and symbolic lights, Ritual in hand! And it is there he realized that he at last understood the esotericism of the Master’s Doctrine, its true import, material and spiritua l. With Saint-Martin advising – as he himself admits – and for a ll important spiritual matters, be it by means of the ‘Inner Way’ or by the aid of “passes”, the entit y of the Order, the mysterious “Unknown Philosoph er”, Wille rmoz drew more from his Operations than proofs ; rather teachings and counsels ... And it is beyond question in the smoke of incense whic h he burned in honor of the planetary Spirits that we must look for the origin of the projects and intentions for his ma sonic activity!... Doubtless, the anti-masonic writers and ultra-militant Catholics, who assure us that Freemasonry take s its instructi ons and its orders from the other side of the Veil , ex aggerate!

And it is perhaps due to thi s schism between the “spiritual regions” and our world that we have this de- spiritualization in certain m odern masonic Obediences. In December, 1777 the man who was the initiator of Claude de Saint- Martin and Goethe into the “Society of Unknown Superiors” arrived in Lyon: Rodolphe de Saltzman, “Master of Novice s of the Strasburg Directoire\". This man exactly served the plans of Willermoz! Coming from a Protestant family in Alsace, he was an extremely relig ious man, having focused on theological studies in the Univ ersity of Goettingue. Like Willermoz, the purely masonic na ture of the “Strict Observance” had fast disappointed him. We should therefore not be surpri sed if we find him quic kly becoming an Elu-Co hen, under the directi on of J. -B. Willermoz. And one can affirm that historically, it was Saltzman who introduc ed the doctrine of the Elus Cohens int o Germany! The “Strict Observance” had ten degrees: - Apprentice Red Scottis h Green Scottish - Companion Knight of the Eagle Novice (or socius ) - Maste r Knight Rose-Croix Squire Knight The three last ones alone, vaguely recalled this templar parentage which all masonic Obédiences romantically sought. Let us add that, knowing the inan ity of this suppose d direct f iliation, French Freemasons of the XVIII th Century usually, did not take it seriously. Wa s it not a certain attitude to national Monarchy that had formerly destroyed the Order! Willermoz ended, in colla boratio n with Salz man, by adding a “sup erior class” to th e two “symbolic classes” of the “ Strict Obse rvance”, going from Apprentice to the Knight Rose-Croix. This “superior class” carried the name of “Profession”, and its two constituent ranks those of “Professed Knight”. It was this “class” that would transmit the doctrine of the Elus Cohens and replace that of the Réaux-Croix. There was no ques tion, for the moment at least, of Theurgic Rites , whose continuance was reserved to the original Elus-Cohen and to their direct filiation. It is at the “Convent of the Gauls” held in Lyon from November 25 th to December 10 th , 1778, that this reform was enac ted and the “Templ ar Strict Observance”, Province of Auvergne ( being the French Obedience) became the “Knights Beneficent of the Ho ly City” of the present Sc ottish Rectified Rite. - 104 - "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"R.

Symbolic Masonry: - Apprentice; - Companion; - Maste r; - Scottish Master; Superior class or \" Profession \" - Knight Profès; - Grand Profès. The exoteric definition of the new Order was agr eed: Beneficence under all its forms (material assistance, pec uniary, foundations and socia l works, hospitals, paupers, the stricken, etc. ..). Its esoteric definition was of the same nature. Beneficence, alway s! But the assistance brought to suffering hum anity was that w hich the Elus-Cohen offered through their Theurgy and their My sticism. The destroyed Temple which they worked to rebuild was no longer that of Solomon, but that of the purely celestia l Jerusalem, that which truly just ifies its Hebrew signific ation: “Vision-of- Beatitude”. O Modern Tem plars, it wa s for a City or to a To mb whic h was not of this World that they rai sed a disint erested watch! The Infidels themselves had changed the “plan”, and the hostile Desert was transformed into these mysterious “spiritual regions” where frag ile human reason sinks an d is too often misled.

It was chosen because it was in the lunar period immediately following the summer solstice, t hat of Saint John the Baptist, which it defined liturgically. Willermoz immediately found valuable sup port in two of the most powerful Brothers in the Order: Prince s Ferdinand of Brunswick a nd Charles of Hesse. But the French illuminati also found equally powerful opponents before them! The “Illuminés of Bavaria” and their occult chief, the famous Weishaupt.

To the “Illuminés of Bavaria”, was joined t he hostility of the Marquis François de Chefdebien de Saint-Amand, representing the “Philalèthes” and of Savalette de Lange. From the C onvent of Wilhelmsbad, t he Marquis of Virieu, (an Elu-Cohen) took away the impression of a “frightened loat hing that, to him, had created the intrigues; the conspir acy of this sect that claimed to criticize religion and satirize governments”. Nevertheless Willermoz and his friends triumphed. Having been allowed to present his reforming proposal s and his new rituals to the Convent, he had the name of “Knights Beneficent of the Holy City” accepted for all the Brothers of the Inner Order, as was practiced in Franc e, at Lyon. Henceforth, the Scottish Re ctified Ritu al contained for the greater part, the Ritual of Lyon, in which on e Willermoz had skillfully intr oduced preparatory allusions to the Doctrine of Martinez of Pasqually. Finally, a special Commission, under his direction, was charged with rewriting t he rituals and instructions of the High Grades of the Inner Rites, wh ich included at their summ it, the two grades of the “secret class” called “P rofession”, as practiced in the Lyon Rite. The reformi ng work was in full swing w hen, like a thunder clap, the French Revolution burst forth. It annihilated the work of Willermoz. The “Temples”, both Rectified and Cohen, went dormant. The B rothers were dispersed. Terror, war, all were to foil the work in hand. * * * The masonic System of the “Knights B eneficent of the Holy City” was not reestablished in France unt il 1806. It entered into am ity with the Grand Orient almost immediately, with which the “Str ict Observance” had formerl y had treati es of friendship. As for the El us Cohen, since their last Grand Master, de las Caz as, had had their archives given into the hands of the Philalethes at the time of the Order officially being declared dor mant, they had not officially resumed work. And yet in this same year, Bacon de la Chev alerie, Deputy Grand Master for the “Northern Part of the Worl d”, nevertheless sat on the Grand Colleg e of Rites of the Grand Orient of France! From this position he then tri ed, by subtle actions, to effect the reorganization of the Order at the very hear t of the Grand Orient. Howev er, the influenc e of the Marquis of Chefdebien, a member of the Grand Consistory in question must have foiled t he attempts of Bacon de la Chevalerie, for all was denied him. That spirit, par ticular to the Elus -Cohen, could no longer grow in the breast of symbolic Masonry as conceived by the Grand Orient. The split was fundamental. The Rite of the “Knights Beneficent” then passed then into Switzerland, through the Directoire of Burgundy, which transmitted its pow ers to the Swiss Directoire.

THE PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOL OF FR EEMASONRY One now can admit that t he teaching coming from Martinez de Pasqually split into two branches after the death of the Maitre. One, th rough the channel of high Mysticism and the School of Claude de Saint-Martin, bring us the technique of the “Inner Way”. The second, through the prudent and patient work of J.-B. Willermoz, is accessib le to us through r egular masonic esotericism. Moreover, this esotericism is rendered even clear er, and two levels of teaching appear welded to meticulous Masonic Ritual, and so we put forward a third and final interpretation. The two first esoteric teachings transmitted to us by symbolic Freemasonry (principally with the so-ca lled grades of “S t. John”: Apprentice, Companion and Master), contain firstly common Magic and secondly Alchemy. Both constitute the operative part of this Symbolism. The third one and last door to Philosophy tha t reveals esotericism, thus constitutes “speculativ e” Masonry. Such is the approach that can addre ss all intelligent commentary on the traditional Ritual of the “Sons of the Widow ”. Magic, Alchemy and Mysticism also constitute the habitual symbolism that we discover in the tympanums of the gothic cathedrals, expressed by these audacious Hermetists who were the great “Master of the Work” of for mer tim es.

Philosophy became Po litics. Even that which should have remained “speculativ e” is returned to normal cy as “operative”!... We are not accusing anybody. The De miur ge, better than us, knows this that suits the Absolute! Everything in th is World, undergoes the inexorable law of awakening and sleeping; birt h, apogee and decline. “To die is to be reborn” is the very pri nciple of all initiation. From the derailing of such Obedien ces, contaminated by a growing materialism – and similarly in other human Institutions (Church, State, Family, Individual, etc. ..) – c an we not equitably conclude a total deviation from the ideals that were once those of Freemasonry? Here, as in other institutions, we should not despair. The profound spiritua lity that formerly existed can re- emerge, in the same way that the evangelical spirit of primitive Christianity can burn once more in the heart of an apparently hardened Catholic. It is through the intelligent and tradition al pe rsevering action of its affiliates that Freemasonry will at last rediscover its true face , the one that its true promoters had desired: the Rose-Croix . .. THE DOCT RINE OF MARTINE Z OF PASQUALLY AND MAS ONIC ESOTERICISM As we strove to show it, J.-B. Wille rmoz tried to express as overtly as possible, in regular masonic ritual and in creating a spiritual Obedience for which the climate was eminently favorable, t he essence of the doctrine received among the Elus-Cohen. In that, he show ed without possible argument, that unquestioning faith he had for the teachings of his master Martinez of Pasqually, and for the cogency of his work. In that, ce rtainly, he effected the instructions he had most probably received as a member of the Sovereign Tribunal and “S. J.”. The masonic side of Martinism thus cons tituted the personal work of J.-B. Willermoz, continuing that of Marti nez of Pasqually. In fact, none could enter the Elus-Cohen (Porch Class) if he w as not al ready in poss ession of the “totality of masonic rights”; that is to say holding the 3 rd Degree of Master. It is with the objective of facilitating this first initia tion that Martinez of Pasqually had created, before the “Porch Clas s”, t he “Symbolic Class”, compri sed of tradi tional “Lodges of Saint John”, working the three usual degr ees of Apprentice, Companion and Master. Besides, a letter of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin explains it well: the three degrees were to be conferred at one ti me , whereas none of the degrees in the hierarchy of the Elus-Cohen were conferred in this manner.

In order to fight agains t the materi al distress of the governed, against the misery of the humble, it necessarily descended onto the material plane, thus leaving behind the purely spiritual am bience of its high asse mblies.

The men in the body of Masonry who direct ed the fight, were mostly full of faith and goodwill. They had only a single objecti ve, to restore int egrity: the Good and the Better. For this goodwi ll, for this faith in a bette r future, for this hope for a greater love between men, one should abs olve them, even if their work, when all is said and done, were reprehensible ( and it was not. ..), Masonry remained innocent, for it never anticipates Error, but Truth. Do the errors or defects of certain el ements of the clergy remove from the Church, revered by so many Catholics, part of its moral author ity, and do they distort the precious deposit that had been entrusted to it of old? Clearly not. We demand this same equity for Freemasonry. Despite the affirmations of its detractors, Masonry is not a vehicle for social dem olition, a corrupt organism whose nefarious activities propagate the disease which it attracts. Any mason, and not only the lesser ones (for a cord or collar do not an Initiate or Adept make; but only his own interior work), can err. And the opposite would be astonishing.

From this preliminary freedom in whic h another replies on his behalf, to what is the neophyte indebted? What new moral viewpoint does it give him? What is this liberty? Negative liberty consists of mastery of oneself, in the reabsorbtion of the shackles of materialism and passion which belong to slaves. There is also a period of active asceticism, itself generat ed by the positive aspect of this kind of liberty... This is the liberty of realization. This ultimate liberty is the true one fr om the masonic point of view: the liberty to bring about . Through this theme which is developed in its three successive degrees, symbolic Masonry claims to make of a profane a “New Man”. It gives him a second life; it makes hi m born anew. This birth to spiritual light consists of breaking open the mire of passion, of cr acking open the intellectual chrysalis of prejudice and error, of which the soul of ordinary man is too often held prisoner, impeded in its momentum towards Trut h by so many obscure and dubious matters . The entry in the Temple, such as ritual provides, provokes a psychological shock, the shock of light, abruptly re vealed by the sudden fall of the black blindfold. This is to awaken on a new plane. A new vision of beings and things . * * * Masonry, neutral from a religious point of view, does not want a common Morality based upon metaphysical fear, or upon reward or punishment after death. Masonry seeks essential Truth , Beauty in itself , the Supreme Good , without being concerned about the consequences generat ed by the egoism of race, nation, and indiv idual (allowing for the progression necessary to the stability of the Cosmos). Thus it accept s compromi ses and crossroads, but those focused on the final Goal that it ha s in view, and never compromises or regressive paths. It is not in vain that its Symbolism attributes such importance to the East , where Light is born daily, and it is not without the most profound motives that this Light personifies the highest Good in its Temples. Masonry accepts the opinion of the present time, so far as it contains a spark of the truth, but combats error and ignorance. It a ccepts a lesser good in order to move towards a certain better futu re.

For her, Beauty and Goodness are limitles s in Time and Space, and no dogma can confine it. For as well as Light, its guide is also Hope... And this justifies its apparent religious indifference. * * * Masonry does not only tend to creat e pure and strong personalities among its Adepts: it also wants to illumin ate the masses as much as possible, having them understand what true justice, equity, law and duty are, and to confirm them in liberty through that true brotherhood, that “ caritas generis hum ani ”, once evoked by Cicero and the Stoics. This is why its teaching is also an apostolate, and in her Temples all converges towards action, without remaining in the domain of indiv idual anagogical reverie.

Hope is not that blissful aspiration for a problematic and often undeserved aid; towards a free reward, i nadequate for the effort put out to win it.

The Freemason, in fact, does not claim personal rights of the free and upright man, except in order to accomplish this duty, for he knows well that these rights ar e relative and limited, but that his work is entire and without limit. Also, the Freemason must consider himself as an apostle, a leader commissioned among the elite, for he must strive to become – and he must become – at the same time an initiate, an illuminated one, a m an of heart, a man of science, and also a man of acti on. Perhaps one may now realize, from the glimmers of these few clarifications on the true inner aspect of Freemasonry, that this vast association is fundamentally more than the banal self-help association, more than a brotherhood of tastes and opi nions, and above all more than a shameful means to hoard sordid materialism?

MODERN MARTINISM As we have set forth at length in the preceding chapters, the occult teachings of Martinez de Pasqually was consequently transmitted through the XIX th Century, partly through the Kabbalistic Areopages , composed of Elus- Cohen who had not conformed with the order to deposit their archives in the hands of the “ Philalethes ” (the Marquis Savalette de Lange); and partly through some Masons of the “ Scottish Rectified Rite ”, holders of the secr et instruction of J.-B. Willermoz and the “ Knights Beneficent of the Holy City ”; and partly by the “ S.I.s ” affiliated with the school of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin. The latter spread the doctrine of the “ Unknown Philosopher ” through France, Germany, Denmark, and above all through Russia. These were the famous free initiators, who had responsibility for transmitting t he “sacrament” of the Order, without setting up groups (of members). It is by one of these, Henri Delaag e, that the young Parisian occultist called Doctor Gérard Encausse, better kn own by his esoteric name of Papus, was “initiated” into the Order of “S.I” in 1880, and he resolved to propagate it as a means to gathering together the intelle ctual elite of Western Occultism. This is how it was done. * * * Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin had transmitted the initiation of which he was the depository, following Rodolphe de Salzmann , Gitchel , and Jakob Boehme, to the Abbé de Lanoüe , in whose house at Aunay, near Sceaux, he had resided for some time, and wher e his house also was; and to Chaptal, Compte de Chanteloup . In turn, the Abbé de Lanoüe transmi tted the precious deposit to André Chénier , guillotined during the Terror, and to Joseph Antoine Hennequin . He in turn initiated Henri de la Touche , who initiated Antoine Desbarolles , Compte d’Authencourt , who initiated his cousin, Amélie de Boisse-Martemont , who transmitted this initiation and its traditions to her nephew, Pierre Augustin Chaboseau , from whom proceeded very many present day Martinists. In parallel, Chaptal has initiated an unknown, whose name is not known, but who must have existed, since we find Henri Delaage in possession of this initiation in 1880. On his deathbed Henri Delaage called for the young doctor who was Gérard Encausse , laid his hands upon him, consecrated him “S.I.” in accordance with the rule, without however giving him any of t he secret tradition (due to the lack of time). This resulted in confidences made by Dr. Encausse to the senior members of the Supreme Council of 1884, which we will discuss later     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"R.

At this time, Dr. Encausse, Augusti n Chaboseau (librarian at the Guimet Museum), Jean Moréas and Charles Mauras (future director of l‘Action Français ), had lunch together every Tuesday in a sm all restaurant on the Left Bank. They talked about anything and everything, and that is how, by pure chance, Papus and Chaboseau discovered that they were both legitimate and regular disciples of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin. Being a devotee of active organizati on, Papus immediately resolved to FOUND an Order which would bear the name of l’Ordre Martiniste (the Martinist Order). He already had grouped t ogether some Parisian occultists. With ten others Papus and Chaboseau constituted the first “Supreme Council”, which had twelve members to begin with (and not twent y-two...). In truth, it was Papus who took upon himself most of the ritual regularization, rather than Chaboseau, having received the filiation of Saint -Martin three years earlier than him. To this end, from their recollecti ons, and from notes taken following their respective initiations, these two recons tructed from memory the ceremonial presently known under the name “ the ancient ritual of the XVIII th century ”. Thereafter, when old and authentic doc uments finally reached them, they restored the aforesaid ritual to its anci ent primitive form; so captivating, so elevated, and so beautiful. Thus the Martinists were constitut ed, with the following members of the Supreme Council (the famous “Council of Twelve”...): Stanislas de Guaita – Chamuel – Sedir (Yvon Leloup) – Paul Adam – Maurice Barrès (friend of Stanislas de Guaita) – Jules Lejay – Mantière – Charles Barlet – Jacques Burget , and Joséphin Péladan (this, together with Papus and Chaboseau, made the first dozen symbolic members). Later Barrès resigned due to Catholicism, and Joséphin Péladan for other reasons, each more bizarre than the other 64 . They were replaced by Victor Emile Michelet for Péladan , and Dr. Marc Haven for Maurice Barrès . And so the Martinist Order was constituted in 1884. This organization had for its aim the organization of Martinis t Lodges, propaganda in spiritualist circles, and the diffusion of the doctrine by means of the review entitled “l’Initiation”. In 1893 the Lyonnais Martinist came into po ssession of the archives of J.-B. Willermoz and the Lyon “Cohen Temple”, which the widow of Joseph Pont,  64 We refer the reader to the spiritual work of Vitoux: ”Les Coulisses de l’Au-delà ( the Channels of the Beyond )”, the chapter titled “La Guerre des Deux Roses ( The War of the Roses )”."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"R.

These were the Bergeron brothers and Bréban-Salomon in Lyon; Carl Michelsen in Denmark; Dr. Edward Blitz in the United States. “Dr. Edward Blitz was a “ Knight Beneficent of the Holy City ”, and a high grade member of the Masonic Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm ”. He was also the direct successor of Antoine Pont and of Willermoz. And so he became president of the Grand Council of the Martinist Order, as renovated by Papus, for the United States. In this quality (r epresentative and legitimate inheritor of Martinez de Pasqually) he resolved to reestablish the Order in the United States, on ancient traditional bases. In France, his representat ives were Dr. Fugairon, and later Charles Detré, who, under his esoteric name of Teder, established the Rituel Martiniste français (French Martinist Ritual ) in accord with Papus (this Ritual was edited in Paris in 1913 in the care of Dorbon-Aîné). Here, Jean Bricaud, who was work ing from imperfect documents, transcribed from oral traditions by doc umenters who either misunderstood or garbled what they heard, committed certain involuntary historic errors. In fact, a number of old letters, signed by the main leaders in Martinism from this period, or from parallel Secret Societies, (Papus, Teder, Bricaud, Théodore, Reuss, E. de Ribeaucourt, Phaneg, etc...) are in our hands, as well as documents coming from the Supreme Council. And these allow us to definitively clarify certain obscure points 65 . 1 st ) The verbal tradition of the Ly onnais Martinists, who believed that Teder transmitted the legitimate filiation of the Elus-Cohen to Papus, is false. An official document, comi ng from the Supreme C ouncil, dated September 29 th , 1918, tells us this: ORDRE MARTINISTE   65 Since the Liberation we have restored these documents to their owners, who had only entrusted them to us.

But we have never found any trace of a meeting between these two gentlemen, either t hat Papus met Blitz or that the latter traveled to Europe. One would ackno wledge that, in order to be truly efficient and regular in form, an initiation must make use of the ritual channel ( if it may be abridged as such), and executed in the joint presence of the Initiator and the Candidate.

Now, Papus never said anything about a regularization with Blitz or about an affiliation with the Elus-Cohen, to which Blitz may have had a legitimate claim, and we will have to await a legitimate doc ument about this in order to prove such an event historically occurred. On the contrary, it is Bricaud himself who tells us in his Review of Martinism , that Papus granted Dr. Blitz a Charter as President of the Martinist Grand Council for the United States . One can surely conclude that Papus, if he were sub-initiate, would not have been so impolite as to act thus regarding his initiator , and would his initiator would have lacked any backbone to the point of relinquishing all moral authority regarding his recent recruit? This is highly unlikely! Besides, Dr. Blitz didn’t keep the pow er conferred upon his by Papus for long. Since he had considerably modified t he spirit in which the Martinist Order had been established by the latter, the Supreme Counc il published an edict “from the Orient of France ” in a revue entitled the Star of the Orient . There is was announced that the charter of the “Sovereign Delegate-General for the United States”, which had been conferred on Dr. Blitz, was abolished, and this charter has been replaced by that of “I nspector-General of the Order for the United States: in the person of Mrs . Margaret B. Peeke, also a 33 o in the Droit Humaine 67 . This fact is attested to in a not e by Dr. H. Spencer Lewis, dated 1937, which we have in our possession. And the role of S. Margaret B. Peeke is attested in a letter of Jean Bricaud, also in our archives, dated January 5 th , 1919. A final rumor is that the Braban-Sa lomon brothers who, being from Lyon, could have regularized Papus. Unfortunat ely, we have found no evidence that these two survivors of Martinezism and t he old Martinists. Ex-members of the Supreme Council who we interrogated on th is subject, knew no more than us about them. From what precedes, we are led to conclude that t he Members of the various Martinist branches are in possessi on of but a single filiation which, through Claude de Saint-Martin, is tr aced back to Jakob Boehme and Henry Kunrath. There could, we suggest, be no more honorable line! For without a doubt, Saint-Martin had been an Elu-Cohen and Réaux- Croix, but it is also without a doubt that he was judged worthy of entry into the mysterious Society of which we have spok e earlier, and that it was not the Elu-   66 This passionate plea for face-to-face initiation is particularly relevant given the number of so- called mystical societies to offer ‘astral initiation ’ or ‘initiation by mail’ in the present time, and always for a large fee - PV. 67 She died in 1908."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"R.

Thus is was the filiation of Boehme and the “Unknown Philosophers” alone which he has transmitted to them. On the other hand, we know well that the truth of the secret tradition and ordination of the Réaux-Croix of Martinez, which Willermoz. Thus we can reach the new conclusion that all legitimate holders of this title (c urrently called “Knights Beneficent of the Holy City”) are in possession of the Sacramental Order of the Elus-Cohen, formerly instigated by Don Mart inez De Pasqually, if not in form, at least “ in efficacy ”. This long aside on the Martinist filiations ended, let us return to the history of modern Martinism. Around 1908 a troublesome event occu rred within the Order. In our archives, we have in our possession the order of exclusion from Freemasonry and Martinism of Messrs. René Guénon, Je an Desjoberts and Victor Blanchard (not to be confused with his homonym, a la ter member of the Supreme Council), in an undated document. This brief, whose leaves are filled with small regular and compact annotations by Teder himself, underline the theme of the following accusation. The three aforementioned members had attemp ted to create a division within the Order, of procuring lists of the names of Mem bers with the intention of founding another organization alongside the Martin ist Order, whose objective was to attract and divert the occult and heterodox impetus into a “siding”, then to dissolve it completely, once their objec tive had been realized. In these notes, Teder accused certain militant clerical organizations, which he didn’t name, and the Grand Orient of France, who were hostile to Illumined and Mystic Orders. We will not dwell on the trut h of these accusations, but it is fact that as a result of the judgment pronounced by the Supreme Council of the Martinist Order and by the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis- Mizraïm, Messrs. René Guénon, Jean Desj oberts and Victor Blanchard had to leave the Martinist organization 68 . It seems certain that occult irregulars, of obscure origins, but certainly of clerical origin tried, so me time before the start of the war of 1914 – 1918, to destroy Martinism. We still have a letter from a senior mem ber of the Supreme Council, Phaneg , in our possession. He was a known occultist who showed himself to be hostile to the very principle of initiatic Orders, Es oteric Fraternities and all such associations in general. The letter is dated 1916. This is the same Martinist who, in addition after the death of Papus, would have withheld a letter from him appointing another Ma rtinist, with the esoteric name of ”Librabius”, his   68 This in no way reflects on the purity of intention of these initiates!

It appeared to the Council that this letter, in the hand of Papus himself, would have allowed, to dissolve the Martinis t Order and replace it with the Ordre Universel de la Nouvelle Egypte (O.U.N.E.) (Universal Order of New Egypt) which would have thus taken the place of Martinism, as a center of dissemination of High Esoteric Doctrines. We will ignore the question of whether Papus was the true author of this letter, and if that were the case, what the true reasons of this astonishing decision were. Yet if it is true (and that is possible, since we must remember the affection that Papus showed for Roman Ca tholicism in his latter years), it was certainly not to the tast e of the “Unknown Superiors ” and the “Passed Masters”, who, from “behind the Veil”, truly led the Order! The De ad, when they are elite, highly evolved souls, and directed toward s a specific goal, see the bigger picture and pre-empt the Living. And t he response came immediately. After the death of Papus, the attempt ed sacrilege of Brother Librabius was put to rest, Teder was named as his r egular successor by t he members of the Supreme Council, and Martinism continued... We personally approve this action unreser vedly. It is certain fact which no elder Martinist would contradict, and whic h merits being noted in the interest and study of future Martinists. For some time previously a certain Christian emollient, promoting childish sentimentality and “whining”, had taken the place of the traditional teachings coming from the Illumined O nes of former times. If these people, with their “headma ster” Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, knew how to remain in the exalted spheres of Mysticism, and remain pure Gnostics in the true sense of the word, it was simply a Martinist core being devout! Sédir (Yvon Leloup) whose Britt any Catholic herit age had led him, with other Martinists, to a strong sense of Cat holicism, had led him to attempt, little by little, to move Martinism in this dire ction. This excess was followed by a reactionary type of abuse. In the begi nning the general di rection of this movement had been towards synthesis and syn cretism. Hermes, Apollonius, Fo- hi and Buddha had been placed on the same level as that which the Passed Masters called “La Chose” (from the Latin causa , the Effective Cause), the Repairer, even Christ himself! Like the other camp, a good number of the Members of the Supreme Council also rejected the ritual created by Blitz. This communal esotericism brought about a very strong reaction, resulting in a return to the original spirit of Ma rtinism, which put the Word, the Johannite Logos , on a plane where no offensive compar ison with imperfect, carnal beings could be made. This led to numerous polemics, at times violent, with Theosophy. We have some quite interest ing letters of Papus on this subject."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 125 - And from this return to esoteric Chri stianity, without realizing it, one also finds oneself falling back into exoteric Christianity again... Let us now return to the story of the modern movement. * * * In 1908, Teder and Papus organized a C ongress of Spiritual Masonic Rite in Paris, with the purpose of re-attachi ng the new Martinist Order to High Grade Masonry. This is what Martinez de Pasqually, then J.-B. Willermoz, had formerly tried to do. And in 1914, following an agreement with the Grand Master of the Scottish Rectified Rite ( Dr. E. de Ribeaucourt ), it was decided to create a “Grand Martinist Chapter”, exclusively compos ed of titled High-Grade Masons, to serve as a link between ordinary Martinism and Sc ottish Rectified Rite Freemasonry. This Chapter took the name of “INRI”. The Great War of 1914 – 1918, the deat h of the Grand Master, Dr. Gérard Encausse (Papus), happening in 1916, and changes taking place in the Grand Mastership of the Scottish Rectified Rit e of France, prevented the success of this project. Papus’ successor to the Grand Master ship was Charles Détré (Teder). He died in 1918, transmitting his powers to Brother Jean Bricaud, from Lyon. After the war, at the ti me of the reorganization of the Order in Lyon, this group also established a Masonic base for Martinism, decreeing that only Masons possessing the grade of Master (3 rd ), as Martinez de Pasqually had wished, would be able to enter Martinism. Jean Bricaud himself told us that he had been “in contact with Dr. Edward Blitz, through the intermediat ion of Dr. Fugairon and Teder himself”. He had also spent time with the past official represent atives of Willermoz in Lyon (M.C... and Dr. L... in particular), and had welcomed t heir teachings. This is why he returned completely to the concepts of Marti nez de Pasqually and Willermoz, which had been set aside since the Grand C onvent at Paris in 1908. And so he superposed Martinism on symbolic Freemasonry. Henceforth, in the Lyon branch, in order to receive the first degree of Martinism, it would be necessary to be a Master Mason, and to be invested with the following degrees,     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"R.

Jean Bricaud died on 21 st February, 1934. He was succeeded by Mr. Chevillon, author of “The True Face of Freemasonry”. * * * When Papus died in 1916, as we have seen from the preceding section, his successor Charles Détré (Teder) clearly oriented Martinism towards Masonry, no doubt of a spiritual and myst ical nature, but in a dire ction that the mystical school of “S.I.s” coming from Saint-Martin had always refused to impose on its adherents. This is why a large part of the Martin ist Order, remaining faithful to the spirit of their promoter, restarted the tradition of Free Initiation , from person to person, as had been done by Lou is-Claude de Saint-Martin. These “initiators in the ancient form 69 ”, to use the expression of Jean Bricaud in a letter in our possession, also resurrected t he old ritual from the XVIII th Century, full of charm with its outdated French. T hey abandoned the ritual es tablished by Papus and Teder (the 1913 Ritual) and repr oduced that of Blitz, taking up the simple yet nevertheless grand tradition instituted by Claude de Saint-Martin and his predecessors. Coming together in sma ll groups, the only concession made to the past 70 was to sometimes name these groups “Lodges”, and sometimes “Jurisdictions”. And so, in Paris, alongside the Lodge “Papus” (Lyon branch) functioned “Velleda”, “Hermanubis”, :Bro céliade”, “Athanor” and other Lodges. The Grand Master of these was Augustin Chaboseau. This branch of Saint-Martin was incontestably the more important, since it didn’t of necessity require a prio r Masonic “Mastership” of its affiliates. But on the other hand, one mi ght reproach them for har dly being Martinist in nature. In fact, most of these affiliates rallied under doctrine strange to the Judeo-Christian tradition, foundation of the Passed Masters of the Order...Theosophy, Celtism, and above all Buddhism and Brahmanism were the schools in which they pursued their personal convictions. There is but one Truth , and esoteric doctrines ar e but rays which escape therefrom. This is certain. Yet it is necessary for each ray to shine in its proper place: it is inharmonious for a Lama to preach the Go spel, for an Imam to teach Tantra, for a Yogi to affi rm the Triads or for a Kabbal ist to lecture on Taoism!   69 “Initiateurs à l’ancienne mode” - PV. 70 That is, the past 50 years of revived Martinism - PV."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"R.

It is thus difficult to assert with the discipl es of Buddha that Heaven, Earth, Demons and Gods, Fallen Man and Man-God ar e nothing but samsaric illusions!... One cannot be a Martinist and a Buddhist at the same time. Yet we must recognize that Martinist doctrines c an appear quite “obsolete” nowadays, while Buddhism retains all of its worth. * * * As for the “Lyonnais” branch, cleav ing to the school of Martinez de Pasqually and Willermoz, it had its active center in Lyon. From 1936 to 1939 it had a center of propaganda, the “College of Occultism” at 17 rue Washington, Paris, there each Sunday a large crow d came to hear talks on Spiritualism, Hermeticism, Occultism, etc... These “L yonnais” Martinists gathered in the bosom of “Papus” Lodge, having the obedien ce of Memphis-Mizraïm as their antechamber which, with their two Pari sian Lodges (“Jérusalem égyptienne” and “l’Age nouveau”) transmitted the requir ed masonic initiation to Martinist neophytes. The “Grand Prieuré des Gaul es” which was led by Dr. Camille Savoire, transmitted regular initiation into the “Chevaliers Bienfaisants de la Cité Santé”, according to the instructions established by Willermoz in 1778 at the “Grand Convent des Gaules”, at Lyon. The Second World War of 1939 – 1945 was to interrupt the new activity in Martinism. * * * From June 1940, immediately followin g the formation of the Pétain government, two decrees pertaining to Secr et Societies were promulgated. By a decree dated August 14 th , all secret societies were declared illegal, their good and premises seized and sold for the profit of the wor ks of the Public Assistance department. A decree in the winter of 1940 – 41 dissolved the Martinist Order and the Église Gnostique . These two organisms had completed an accord in 1911. Through this treaty, the Église Gnostique Universelle was recognized as the official church of Martinism. T hus the secular doctrine of Martinez de Pasqually were linked to an esoteric pr iesthood. Ratified and enlarged by Téder in 1917, the second version of this treat y gave the right to sit on the “Supreme Council” to the members of the High Gnostic Synod, and vice versa. This, then, is the reason that the Église Gnostique was dissolved at the same time as Martinism.     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"R.

The speed with which these employers, who were all notor ious anti-masons, militant Catholics or publicly declared anti-occultists, were put together tends irrefutably to prove that the private organizations of these various groups, which in peace time led a merciless war against all Occultism, became ipso facto the official service of the Government, and that in consequence t he defeat of the Fr ench people, from which this new state of affair s was born, had been predicted, and even welcomed, by certain fanatics. Whatever it may be, Martinism, which had never involved itself in politics, was not forgotten! The homes of all the members whos e names the Vichy Government had been able to secure were searched. T hey seized books, and under the pretext that masonic documentation was banned (historical works, doctrines, revues, etc...) they confiscated purely occult documentation! Thus, magnificent private collections were pillaged by the services of the Prefecture presiding over the liquidation of dissolved Associations. Some were sent to Germany, others dispersed and sold. Those works whic h were furthest from Masonry, yet declared dangerous by our Catholic mi litants, were seized, and Astrology, Kabbalah, Magic, Alchemy, Symbolism, va rious philosophical or religious studies (Buddhism, Hinduism, etc...) did not escape ostracism, resurrected from across the prior centuries. One bloodhound from the Pr efecture even put it into his head to find Claude de Saint-Martin to question him on his masonic activities! It took no end of trouble to convince him that Saint-Martin had died in the 17 th Century, was dead and buried! (This story is rigorously authentic!) . At the same time the seized people under the most fallacious pretexts. One such Martinist who was also a mason, who had kept a few masonic documents or jewels, found himself a ccused of reconstituting a dissolved organization, and sent purely and simply to la Santé 71 , in Fresnes, or to a concentration camp.

Finally, on March 23 rd , 1944, Constant Chevillon, Grand Master of the Order, Patriarch of the Église Gnostique , former teacher of Philosophy in Lyon, was assassinated by machine gun, after being removed form his home by pseudo-police, in r eality militants from “collaborator” organizations (Parti Populaire Française, M.S.R. and Milice). In another area, that of freedom of the Press, the Government took similar steps. In May 1942, the “C omité de Répartition de Papier 72 ” was created, which imposed a veritable ideological tyranny ( and this is no partisan exaggeration).   71 A German military prison - PV. 72 “Committee for the Distribution of Paper” - PV."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"R.

For this, the Edit or presenting the work had to complete a form indicati ng the Author’s identity, the technical characteristics of the proposed work (format, pagination, etc...) and the category in which it was being entered: history, novel, sciences, philosophy and religion, etc... It was then given to a reading committee, care fully chosen, which only figured people known for their political or religious convic tions, or for their in terest in the Vichy Government. Works that were “right thinking” or in the political spirit of the day were assured, not only of obtaining t he required authorizati on, but also the approval necessary to obtain the preci ous paper. No point in adding that anything which touched on Occultism or Es otericism was rigorously rejected! Yet a strange fact: the Germans contented t hemselves (more adroitly, perhaps) with adjourning authorization of publication for suspect books, while the “right- thinking” censors invariably rejected them. Robustly organized and conceived, this magnificent “extinguisher” of t hought functioned with a remarkable discretion and modesty. If one adds that those who “extinguished” manuscripts seized in the course of the searches, later “lost” or “destroyed” them, one must admit that the “people of the Maréchal” (Pétain) ce rtainly merited their French inheritance – be it spiritual or literary... It may be said with little exaggerati on that a complete arbitrariness presided over the application of all the measures, sometimes even, alas!, a most visible dishonesty! One can also add that for those detained, the danger was not small! In fact, it was from the co ncentration camps that t he German authorities randomly chose hostages who were to be shot as ‘examples’, following attacks by snipers (sixty-five thousand hostages were shot in the department of the Seine and Paris alone) ! But we should also emphasize the wonderful examples of solidarity of which the Martinists of this time can be proud. Divided (like all French communities) into partisans for a tenacio us resistance, and partisans for Franco- German collaboration, for all that they did not forget their Fraternal ties. So it is that Dr. B.., impris oned despite his great age for possessing a few old cartridges dating from the 1914 – 1918 war discovered in the bottom of a drawer, was freed form prison by a Martinist “collaborato r”. This man, without fearing to compromise himself, put increasing pre ssure and proceedings until the Gestapo agreed to release Dr. B... to this Martinis t, worthy of the Great Traditions of the XVIII th Century. But the initiatic Secret Societies s eemed to have been dealt a heavy blow. Before such a violent attack, the old Martinists, helpless and horror-stricken by this militant and tenacious hatred, put t he Groups to sleep, and spread death in their soul.     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"R.

More than ever, private correspondence in these subjects was dangerous; the transportation and transfer of documents or ritual objects even more so. Regarding and kind of meeting, this could immediately result in the seizure of personal effects of those taking part. In the streets, by m eans of transportation, raids and searches were frequent, and t hey went through entire communities (following attacks on the occ upying troops) searching house by house, apartment by apartment, room by room, for many hours. Despite all these danger, a trio of known Occultists decided to “revive” the Tradition. One of the three was a Mart inist, from the lineage of the “Unknown Superiors” of Louis-Claude de Sain t-Martin. He initiated the two others, on April 4 th , 1942. Easter Monday, on April 6 th of the same year, two days later, all three formed a Martinist “triangle”, with the ai m of reawakening the tradition of the Order of Elus-Cohen, and of recommencing a ll the work – even theurgic. To find a “Name” for this Lodge, they had recourse to the Tarot . One of then drew a card, the Papess, the Second card of t he Major Arcana, signifying the Hebrew letter “Beth”. The second drew another card : the Major Arcana card V, the Pope, letter “Heh” in the Hebrew alphabet. T he Pope and the Papess! These were two occult cards par excellence..! The third affiliate then established the “Name” of the Lodge, which was “Bethelios”. Bethel , in Hebrew, “The divine house”.

The two others took the names of “Phalgus” (genius of Judgment in the Nuctameron of Apollonius of Tyana) and of “Baphometos” (a Greek transcription of his own family name). “ Aurifer ” had been initiated earlier by “ Harmonius ”, who had been initiated by A. Chaboseau . The lineage was thus incontes table. Acting as “witnesses” were “ Mikaël ” (ex-member of the former Supreme Council of 1884, in the quality of Principal Inspector, init iated by “Téder”), and Hierax. There is no question theref ore of the initiatic l egitimacy of ”Aurifer”. Let us return to the work of “ Bethelios ”. Our three occultists (Phalgus, Ba phometos and Aurifer) had among their connections many friends or correspondent s who wished to move on from pure study to experimentation, from “specul ative” work to “operative” work.

The Rituals were studied; and a new operative “form” was established, to take into account t he modern epoch, the spirit (which was different from that of men of the XVIII th Century), but for all t hat in rigorous accord with the magic and Martinezist Tradition . On Thursday, 24 th September, 1942, at the so lar hour of midnight (which was two o’clock in the morning in terms of the time imposed by the Occupation), eight Circles were illuminated in Paris (s even were situated on the periphery of the Capital, one only in the center, near to Saint-Eustache!). Three of the eight, following the celebration of the Gr and Equinoctial Conjuration, had an appearance of the famous “ passes ”. Faithful to the “ Promise ”, the Invisible Powers had hastened to the meetings, held nearly two centuries later ... During the following six months, we worked without cease; selecting correspondents, choosing most carefully from among the many requests. Frequently the members of “B ethelios” met neophytes of the Occult, desirous of affiliating with any esoteric movement. Bu t all the candidates were not of equal worth and did not offer the same moral guar antee. Finally, it was necessary to take the minutest precautions to maintain absolute secrecy regarding the work in hand, to escape the agents of the Gest apo or the informant s of the Vichy Government. Sometimes in one house, someti mes in another, we met to “ receive ” a new Brother. The same small suitcase transported the black, white and red Cloths, the Candlesticks and Candles, the incense and the Gospel, the Ritual and the Sword, under the very noses of t he police...And, month after month, like the adjuration of a Litany, the hieratic words from the XVIII th Century, opened the same symbolic “Gates” to young men in love with ideals and mysticism. Without a single publication to serve as propaganda, and without appealing to the former members of the disper sed Lodges, on April 4 th , 1943, at the New Moon of the Equinox, eighteen Circles were illuminated in Paris. And on September 29 th of the same year, there were twenty-five similar theurgic ceremonies which, illuminated the silenc e of the night, at the same time... In Pontarlier, Lyon, Calais and Nantes, other S.I.s stood at the center of magic “Circles”, surrounded by the same symbolic “lights” which had protected the Elus- Cohen of former years, commencing at t he same time, in identical form, the same liberating “Vortex” 73 ! The impetus had been given. Henceforth it could not be stopped and, with God’s help, the cohort of Theurgists who had raised up Martinez de Pasqually were going to organize a true “Mystical Knighthood” at the heart of the general materialism.  73 Conceived in a primitive spirit, these exorcisms were directed against EVIL as a concept, and no partisan intent (political, personal, etc) was included.

Thus the new Martinist branch found it self in possession of the Masonic powers necessary to constitute itself as a Martinezist branch, and attach itself to the Elus-Cohen. From among the new S.I.s from the Saint-Martin lineage, who has been ordained by the three founders of the “Bethelios” group, there were three who were “Master” Masons, Brot hers “Andréas” and “Villanova”. Arguing that the old masonic constitution allowed that, at sea, in time of war, or during a period of ”sleep” of regular Obediences, three Masons of the grade of Master could initiate a pr ofane, these two Brothers and Aurifer constituted a “Scottish Triangle” and t hen successively initiated the two most qualified and capable from among the new members. (Two of the three original founders of Bethelios, Phalgus and B aphometos, had objected and refused to affiliate with Freemasonry). The “Scottish Triangle” of three members, thus increased to five, created – according to ritual terminology – a “Just Lodge”; then, to follow, the number of member increased to create a “Perfect Lodge”. This first Lodge took the name of “Alexander of Egyp t”, in the Orient of Paris, in remembrance of the ancient City where the elite of Greco-Roman thinkers converged.

Now, as we said, Brother Mikaël possessed the lineage of Grand-Profès of J.-B. Willermoz, and as such, that of the “Elus-Cohen” of Martinez de Pasqually. His ordination of “Knigh t Beneficent of the Holy City” had been received from Dr. Camille Savoire in person, Grand Master of the Scottish Rectified Rite and incontestable and uncont ested successor of J.-B. Willermoz, at the head of the “Grand Priory of the Gauls”. On September 3 rd , 1943, using the ancient Ri tual and the Sacramentary used of old by the same “Elus-Cohen” (t hat is to say, in accordance with the practical instructions contained in the m anuscript letters in the archives of the Order, and in the handwriting of Martinez and Saint-Martin ), in the center of the Circle marked “with the two Names and the Shin”, and girded by the Eight Names and Eight Lights, Mikaël transmitted the “ powers and rights, duties and charges of the Knight Elu-Cohen and Réau-Croix ” to Aurifer. Of these two grades, the first (Knight -Elect), synthesizing those of “ Grand Master Cohen ” (or Grand Architect) and “ Grand Elect of Zerubbabel ”, the second was that of the first degree of t he famous secret class of the Réaux-Croix . In the spirit of Martinez, the latter c onsisted of a veritable priesthood. The “operations” in this degree were called “cul t”; and the candidate was not initiated, but rather “ordained”, in an allusi on to a “sacramental order”. Now, Mikaël and Aurifer were both possessors of the Cathar Episcopacy following the lineage of J. Doinel . * * * Arguing this transmission, Aurifer c onstituted two other Martinists and S.I.s, similarly holders of this Episcopacy, as “Knights-Elect” and “Réaux-Croix”. Then he ordained the other two S.I.s who we re also Masons simply as “Knights- Elect”. Thus, at the heart of the Martinis t group born out of this war, a legitimate and regular “Cohen Temple” was founded. The necessary Charters were creat ed, detailing the various lines of transmission. The Charter for the Elu Co hen Temple was also drafted. The Statutes and Regulations, bot h general and particular, were fleshed out. Care was taken officially to inform the Scottish Rectified Rite, the Supreme Council for the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm, and the Martinist Order , in its Supreme Council at Lyon: and in order to avoid any dissidence, the name “Martinism” was renounced and"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 135 - replaced with the old title: “ Order of Knights Elus-C ohen of the Universe ”, which had been used in the XVII th Century by its original founders. Within the Cohen Temple the traditi on of daily, monthly and equinoctial Operations were started up once more. In order for the specialist s in the Kabbalah to conti nue to research its great keys, a group was set up inside the general body (Martinists of Saint-Martin and Elus-Cohen of Martinez de Pasqually), ca lled “A.G.L.A.”, which took its name in memory of the analogous Secret Society to which King François I st had belonged, and which we have described in detail in an earlier chapter. At the same time, to bring about a synthesis of gnostic thought, coming from the works of t he ancient doctors (Valentinus, Simon of Samaria, Marcion, Basilides, Heraklion, etc), a High Synod with six members was created, joining the three bishops with three other Parisian gnostic bishops, who were also S.I.s. And so, with the chain of Free Initiators , or “S.I.” according to Saint-Martin, the Cohen Temple in Paris, the “AGLA” Group, and the High Synod, we had reconstituted that which the secular Vichy Government had believed eradicated forever! And, better still, this was an infi nitely more compact organization, with a prolific and decentralized research net work, and an enduring youth and passion, which would henceforth render Martinis m more alive and stronger than ever before. Archival materials, which in cluded unparalleled documents, Charters and Patents both irrefutable and unamb iguous and of unassailable lineages, completed this powerful legitimacy. That which the Old Masters could not achieve had been revived, and, better still, was prospering ... It is then that a dramatic event occu rred, already mentioned above, which completely changed the mutual views of the two Martinist branches. On Saturday, 25 th March, 1944, late in the evening, several men appeared at the home of Mr. Chevillon, rue des Macchabées, in Lyon. He had come down with Mme Vve Bricaud, widow of the late lamented Grand Ma ster of the Order. A few weeks previously, other men had co me and asked for Jean Bricaud. On learning that he had been dead for ten y ears, they made their crestfallen excuses, and left. This time they had done their research. Mr. Chevillon was there. They argued that they had a search warrant, which they refused to show him. They put the house in disarray, seizing some bottles of champagne which had been a gift from a friend on the occasion of the baptism of his children, which had been performed by Chevillon in his qua lity as Patriarch of the Catholic- Gnostic Church of Lyon.

The following morni ng, policemen (genuine ones, this time), paid a visit and told her that the body of her host had been discovered, riddled with bullets, in a piece of waste ground. His money and walking stick were intact. The crime was thus incont estably a political one. This, both laconic and dramatic at the same time, is the story of that drama. In 1940, the anti-mason Vallery-R adot and some legal members of the Vichy Government had already searched t he home of Mme Bricaud. In the lists of important dignitaries of secret societ ies, published by the Official Journal, the name of Chevillon has figur ed. And a few days followi ng the drama, the hireling Maurice Yvan-Sicard of the Parti Populaire Français , head of propaganda, declared in a meeting that it was necessary to “slaughter the heads of high masonry and synarchy”. These anti-mas onic reviews designated Martinism as being identical with this same mysterious “Synarchy”. From this, the campaign to prepare public opinion for the assassi nation of Chevillon was signed... In reality “Synarchy”, a secret organi zation in the pay of trusts and high- finance, most certainly existed. But it had nothing to do with the synarchic principle of state government, wh ich had been preached by a Martinist of the Saint-Martin line, Saint-Yves d’Alveydre! The Martinist Order had knowingly been confused with a purely political and capitalist movement, confusing Ma rtinists with business venturers. Be that as if may, this assassinati on of a sexagenarian l ed, as always, to the generation of a fertile harvest. The two branches at Lyon and Paris, already at the point of definitive uni on, put an end to the separati on. They decided purely and simply to return to the old “Rite of the Elus-Cohen”, the occult and spiritual masonic rite, and to leave the followers of the S.I. lineage of Saint-Martin to self- determination, the right in their qualit y of Free Initiators to assure the perpetuation of their Tradition.

The Temple Class gave practical theurgic education. Through this education, the affiliate stepped into the O ccult Laboratory, and applied himself to the secrets of High Magic. Finally, the Secret Class , called the “Sanctuary”, transmitted a complete sacerdotal initiation, making the Réau-Croix the true and authentic successor of the priests after the Order of Mechisedek and Aaron , with all that this initiation carries theurgica lly to complement the teachings of the “Temple”, and the occult “ powers” conferred by this sacerdotal ordination . * * * With the Elus-Cohen expanded and organi zed, the Western Tradition now possessed a sacred army, such as the Te mple at Jerusalem had once had with its Knight-Levites, or in medieval Chri stianity with its Templars, both priests and soldiers... * * * At the time that we write thes e lines, ending a manuscript which was begun two years earlier under the fear of the police, Paris is victorious and rejoicing, claiming its reconquered liber ty!

And, as twenty-seven C enturies ago in Emmaus and Hebron, the Levites grouped behind Judas Maccabeus against Antiochus Epiphanus, there were Martinist and Elus-Cohen fighting t ogether behind the same barricades!

Here it is in its entirety. HISTORICAL NOTE OF THE MARTINIST ORDER 75 The public interest in initiatic th ings and in esoteric mysteries is considerable, and it needs to be said that one of the fa ctors behind the propagation of these doctrines is the renowned Martinist Order. But few students of the Occult know exactly what is underst ood by that. This is why, in a Review which from its foundation has placed the Sign of this Order on its covers, it  75 It is extraordinary that this document is included for a number of reasons, and the motive of R. Ambelain is unclear. Firstly, it is unusual to quote a complete work by another author. Secondly, it is a odd piece which reads more like a manifesto than an invitation to join a highly spiritual and developed occult order. Thirdly, by claiming that the Ordre Martiniste is the only one with a true lineage, it seems to rebuff Ambelain’s own Ordre des Elus-Cohen! – PV.     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 140 - appeared to be necessary to give a few facts about this Society which is much talked about, usually incorrectly 76 . What one understands by Martinism is a collection of reflections and studies based on teachings transmitted by Claude de Saint-Martin, the Unknown Philosopher. In this Review you will fi nd papers on the doctri ne, life and works of this Philosopher; and we will not stress t hese here, since this paper talks about the Order itself. The existence of a Martinist Order is a precise fact, and even the least knowledgeable reader knows that the Or der was founded by Papus, follower of Saint-Martin. But it is understood that Papus is the successor of Saint-Martin, and as Papus himself said, this Order has as founders Martinez de Pasqually and Saint-Martin himself... The truth is otherwise. Papus wa s the soul and the animator of a movement which resurrected the study of esotericism, at the end of the XIX th Century. Surrounded by talented writer s, seekers and intelligentsia, he intended – and succeeded – to reach even the least informed public about this way of understanding the universe, metaphysics and science. Yet Papus quickly realized that, in order to group together the scattered elements discovered during his research, a Society was needed whic h would unite the threads into one bundle, and allow the study of these systems within a di scipline which he and his friends would see spread abroad. And so he started a specific type of Martinism. Papus had the idea of creating an analogous Order, whose method of work would be noticeably like the interior discipline inspired by Masonic Or ders; and already being initiated into the tradition of Saint-Martin, he intended to place this Order which he had created with his friends under this aegis. Already initiated, he put his vision into being, and we return to G. Van Rijnberk’s book on this subject: there we see how he grouped together Martinists who had been individually initiat ed like himself to bring this order to life – and it was born in 1891. And yet it was necessary to put forw ard something which has an origin, a lineage, a tradition, and placing this Or der under this name, he established something which had already existed in the past in the breast of Scottish Freemasonry, an Order founded by Marti nez de Pasqually, and, outside of Masonry, a Group created by Saint-Martin . We don’t intend to judge Papus, nor to attack him. Neverthel ess, history requires us to explain that the lineage invoked by Papus between these organizati ons and that which he constituted in 1891 is a complete fabrication and marked by a desire for justification. In a  76 This text was destined for the magazine “l’Initiation” which was reappearing, although problematic circumstances were preventing its resurgence."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"R.

Vaughan (2002) - 141 - manifesto dated 1906, Papus wr ote that the Martinist Or der was founded around 1750 by Martinez de Pasqually, continued by Saint-Martin, then by Willermoz until 1810, and that it had taken on a new vigor through the Supreme Council of 1887; announcing that the Supreme Counc il of which he was President had preserved archives since 1767. And so he put forth that one was in the presence of a Society with no issue of continuity, whose current Chief was the legitimate successor of the previous ones. It is certain that the holders of this tradition were linked by a unity of doctrine, but that amounted to the sum of the Order’s continuity. The Order founded by Martinez had officially and offi ciously disappeared at the Convent of Wilhemsbad and, composed of Masons, it had one objective and one particular way of working. Saint-Martin never conti nued this Order, which didn’t continue to exist under this name, and besides, si nce he demitted from all masonic organizations through his letter dated July 4, 1790, he only began to spread his personal system from 1793. As for W illermoz, preoccupied with transcendent Masonry, following the death of Martinez, he devoted his activity to rectified Masonry, a Scottish Rite which may be dissident, yet ever Masonic 77 . Then what is the lineage that Papus can cl aim? Let us just ify the origin of the Martinist Order founded by Papus – a lineage which goes back to Saint- Martin, be it through Chaptal, or th rough the Abbé de Lanoue, and which Van Rijnberk has analyzed in Volume II of hi s study of Martinez, which has no connection with his Order of Cohens, but rather with the Society of Unknown Philosophers whose Statutes were suppl ied by Baron Tchoudy in his “Flaming Star” (1784). It is this Order or mystic brotherhood, which included Khunrath, Gitchel, Salzmann and Boehme among its members, which attracted Saint- Martin when he demitted from the Cohens, the Masons, etc, in his letter dated 1790, when he was in Strasbourg. It is from this Order, which united with the “Brothers of the Orient” which count ed Emperor Alexis Comnenus among its Patrons, and which is still older, that the fundamental and unique symbols of Martinism come, and the letters which accompany the “Chrismon” of the mysterious points of the Order also originate from this group. It is from this Fraternity that Saint-Martin received the ke ys of his Inner Path. It is these which he placed in the hands of his Society of In timates, a Society whose existence is attested to in the letter from Profe ssor Koëster in 1795, cited by Rijnberk, addressed to Von Meyer by J. P ont of whom Gleitchen spoke. Thus it is solely this Society of Intimates of Saint-Martin which Papus resurrected, which he constituted into an Order, and to which he gave a greater masonic form. In other wo rds, under the form of a true obedience, he organized Lodges, Groups, a Supreme Council, et c. – something which had been indeterminate and free, which had been small.   77 In the previous pages we saw that the Or der of Elus-Cohen had clandestinely survived its ‘official’ death...     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 142 - This Martinist Order saw a large am ount of activity, so that one can no longer talk of Saint-Martin and Martinism without evoking the current existence of the Order of the same name. Following the death of Papus (1916), t here was a blossoming of members of the Supreme Council each proclaiming themselves Grand Master, and each in turn recognized by a portion of the me mbers. One publis hed a Ritual; another continued the system of Free Initiators; and finally another which quickly reunited the majority of adherents was not content with the quarter Centur y tradition of the Order, and made so many modifications t hat they really gave birth to a new Order. Arrogating the statements of P apus, and pretending to be his legitimate successor, they claimed r egular filiation form Martinez by means of the Free Initiators who would have transmitted this line, closing this renewed Order to non- masons, requiring masonic degrees prio r to admission, rejecting women, fabricating a Ritual, and constructing an edifice which, from the outside stood upright, in which its constituents believed with a blind faith 78,79 . In view of these facts, a limited but sufficient number of survivors from the original Supreme Council of 1891 reunit ed in 1931, proclaiming the continuance of the Order founded by Papus with them as continuers of the Society of Intimates of Saint-Martin. Announcing themselves the only line justified in manifesting this regularity, they consti tuted a Supreme Council which, as had happened in 1891, chose by election the el dest in esoteric and profane age, and founded Groups according to ancient custom. In order to rein force their claim, they selected to preside over this re stored Council, one of the two surviving associates of Papus, one of thos e who had brought their own unbroken succession from Saint-Martin, to this lin eage: in short, one of those rare people who did not count Papus in their initiatic succession (of course one must understand this refers only to initiatic succession, and not to the title of Grand Master, which had been created by Papus , and which had not existed before him). The Initiation given by the Martinist Order is, in conformity with its origin, of a single degree or grade, and is full and comp lete in this manner. However, it is preceded by a probationary degree, which co mprises two steps, one which is the true initiation, and the second which transmits the powers of the initiator. There is no question of being refused admissi on into the Order on account on non- membership of a masonic order nor on account of one’s sex. The Martinist Order, which calls itself Traditional, and with the sole power to transmit the Order, refuses to accept anyone from another groups as a “free”  78 He is talking of Téder! 79 It is worth mentioning that, given the date of this paper by Chaboseau, there is an implied criticism of Ambelain’s school of Elus Cohen. Although masonic membership was required, this was obtained through the Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm which was also open to women. These lines therefore never excluded women, despite misleading subsequent propaganda. – PV."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 143 - Martinist; on the contrary, being itself of the purest traditional or thodoxy, it is the other pretenders to re gularity who become, ipso facto , “free” relative to the Martinist Order. In 1939, a Convent-General in Brusse ls reunited non-masonic initiatic Societies and Fraternities, and the Martin ist Order, resurrected in 1931, was the only group recognized to possess regularit y of lineage form Saint-Martin, and the only one allowed to speak on behalf of Ma rtinism. Adding the qualification of Tradition, the Martinist Order is vibrant in many countries (USA, Belgium, Demark, Switzerland, Holland) the groups created by Papus are regularized which are considered “free”, since they don’t wish to recognize those organizations which proclaim themselves top be the successors of Papus, because of the changes they have made since his death, and because of the unjustified addition of things other than the tradition of Saint-Martin. Currently, the Traditional Martinis t Order (TMO) is, in the ancient expression, taking on strength and vigor, at least in France (for in the USA in particular it has ceased activity), wher e its members were harassed, searched, and arrested by the Vichy forces, and the S upreme Council, seated in Paris, is about to address all Martinists of the worl d in a circular announcing the official restoration of its works. Now steadfast in the princi ples of its Master the Unknown Philosopher, the Traditional Martinist Order reclaims the honor of seeing itself as the sole depository of this tradition, and calls on al l initiated Martinists to group under its banner, for it represents, in the person of its President and some of its members, a more than millennial Tradition which do es not owe its inception to Papus in 1891: “Papus was only interested in this, as we have shown, and we should admit that the form he gave it was shown to be so viable, so positive and so fruitful, that it has become impossible to conceive of Martinism in any other way”. One can see that there are currently two distinct ent ities: The Traditional Martinist Order, which groups together the Martinists of Saint-Martin ( free Martinism) and the Order of Elus-Cohen (masonic Martinism, of theurgic persuasion). THE ADVERSARIES OF MARTINISM & THE “SECRET” OF THE ORDER In an Order as combative as Martin ism, one would hardly expect it would only court friendships. It was inevitable that, in releasing an action into the material domain as well as in the hyper physical domain, the movement created long ago by Martinez de Pasquall y might create a contrary reaction .

Above all, Martinism fell under pontifical censure wh ich, following the lead of the roman emperors and of decadence, proscribed “Societies of Thinkers” and “Esoteric Companionships”. And so the Encyclical “Qui Pluribus ” of pope Pius IX (the same person who, it appears, was affiliated to Freem asonry at a time when he was only a Prelate...) and dated November 9 th , 1846, tells us: “Animated by a righteous emulation of zeal and the saintly examples of his predecessors, Gregory XVI, of holy memory, and of whom we have been constituted the successor, in spite of t he inferiority of our merit, condemned the same secret societies in his Apostolic Letters, which We also declare condemned and stigmatized by us...” In 1209 the Synod of Rouen had already led by example against the Companions and Crafts, telling us: “..T here are clerics and lay people who engage themselves by means of an oath to a mutual society, thus exposing themselves to perjury (?). The Holy Church declares that it holds such organizations in abhorrence...”. And so it was with well known precedent s that pope Clement XII, on April 28, 1738, published his Encyclical “In Eminent i”. We cannot resist the temptation of giving some extracts demonstrating t he complete ignorance with which a good number of redoubtable c ondemnations were published, else one might have understood the purity of int ention of heretics. We say redoubtable, because until the middle of the XIX th Century, in states such as Spain and Portugal, to name but two, heresy was still punishable by deat h. In Portugal, the act of being recognized as a Freemason resulted in the immediate imposition of this sentence, and for many years it was on board the warships of the King of England, permanently anchored in the Port uguese ports, that the “meetings” of Portuguese masons were held! “We have learned from the renowned public 80 that each day there are being spread far and wide with renewed progr ess, certain societies, assemblies, meetings, aggregations or conventicle s, called Freemasons or under another denomination, according to the variety of languages, in which men of all religions and sects, affecting an appearance of normal honesty (...), join themselves through a pact at once tight and impenetrabl e, according to laws and statutes created by them, and engagi ng in an oath taken upon the Bible, and under the  80 And so this papal condemnation, which hands over these associates to the rigors of a fanatical secular power, rests only upon the “renowned public”.

But such is the nature of the crime, that it betrays itse lf and cries aloud, which brings about its discovery and denouncement.

For if these societies were not engaged in evil, they wouldn’t hate the light; and thus suspicions are raised, and in cert ain States, these af orementioned societies have been proscribed and banned for a long time, as being contrary to the security of the Kingdom.” Later comes the final condemnation: “This is why We forbid, formally and by virtue of the holy obeisance each and every faithful of Jesus Christ, of w hatever state, grade, condition, rank, dignity, preeminence they may possess, be they laity or clerical, secular or regular, even meriting a special mention, to dare to presume under some pretext, whatever color it may ca rry, to enter into the af orementioned societies of Freemasons or otherwise named societies , to propagate them, to provide for them, to receive them on one’ s home, or to give them any other asylum, to hide them, to be enrolled, admitt ed, to attend, or give t hem the power and means of assembling, providing them with something , giving them counsel, assistance, or overt or secret favor, directly or i ndirectly, oneself or through others, in any manner whatsoever, and also to exhort, in cite or engage others to be enrolled, in these types of society, to become members, to attend, a ssist or entertain in some manner at all or to counsel them.

The Bull was not ratifi ed, and the nation passed outside Roman wrath. On May 18, 1751, the successor to Clement XII, pope Benedict XIV issued in his turn the Encyclical “Providas ”.

We have sear ched in vain for the “serenity and evangelic forbearance” which benefited the last heretic who was burned alive at Saragossa, in 1804, in the presence of t he civil and religious authorities, dressed in the San Benito of fustian, yellowed wit h sulfur, as had his predecessors in the preceding centuries!"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 147 - And who could be surprised if the po litical action of certain secret, masonic or para-masonic societies was designed, above all, to make an equally savage fanaticism, which also had little in common with the message of Christ, disappear? Who would dare to contend that this intolerance might be justified by the teachings of the Mount of Olives? Who could not then understand the fidelity which these same sects exhibited toward s publicly Protestant authorities, who were therefore tolerant; while their politic al action was on the contrary bent on the slaughter of the Catholic thrones, purveyo rs of dungeons, gibbets or the stake? Who would dare to deny that these se cts only adopted their hostile attitude to Roman Catholicism because the latter had declared a war without mercy on them first? * * * This general condemnation of Martinism and all secret societies justified the actions of Martinez de Pasqually, when he integrated his Order into the bosom of French Masonry, which was for a ll practical purposes , by reason of the indifference of the French Authorities to t he Bull of Clement XII, outside the reach of the Holy Inquisition. In addition, in our country, many were the great lords of the Court, the great Bourgeoisie with infl uential roles, and even the Prelates and members of the lower clergy, who had re ceived masonic initiation in Scottish Lodges. This also constituted a most effective protection! Nevertheless, this indulgent toler ance by the State would one day disappear. Somber days would return, even in France; the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes 81 , the brutal religious persecutions, following the tolerance which has been promised to the Pr otestants long before, sh owed that, for esoteric doctrines, no age, regime nor promise constitutes adequate security. This justifies why Martinism must always be cons tituted and run as a secret society. Recent events, the brutal hostility manife sted in this regard by the public powers from 1940 to 1944 have shown the good sense of this measure! If Martinism had not been a clandestine Order, if it had had offi cial bulletins, lists of the names of officials, it would have been dissolved in the same manner. Are patronal or workmen’s Syndicates also secret societ ies? Did their regular and official constitutions keep the various French po litical parties safe from the same dissolution, both of body and of belongings? No... In the case of all esoteric or mystical circles, or economic or polit ical groups and organizations, everything was dissolved, goods were confiscated, and their buildings occupied or sold. We may conclude then that the “secre t” of initiatic Fraternities is a measure of wise prudence which is abundantly justified by secular experience. Let us simply note in passing that va rious religious Orders, to which the  81 The Edict of Nantes, proclaimed by Henri IV in 1598 gave partial freedom of worship to the French Huguenots (Protestants).

We will leave the Great Adversary for less dangerous and less brutal hostilities! Strange as it may seem, regular Freem asonry, be it rationalist or free- thinking, has always frowned on mystical O bediences. In Martinism, the doctrine of Martinez de Pasqually, the theurgi c Rites of the Elus-Cohen, and the preponderant role played by the Uncreated Word in this metaphysical system, has tended to shroud the Order with a certai n mystical atmosphere, in a “clerical” color which displeases a number of Masons. This is why Thory, in his work “A History of the Grand Orient of France, Paris, 1812”, tells us in his Pr eface that his objective is : “To forewarn the (members of the A ssociation) against the charlatanism of certain people who have no means of living except by means of the propagation of these produc tions, mainly the daughters of folly and rapaciousness”. In another work (T he Story of Freemasonry in France and abroad) he give us his opinion of Martinez : “Paschalis or Pascalis (Martinez), author of a system known under the name of Martinism: he was the Master of Saint-Martin. Each of them introduced m ystical principles of this system into some of the Lodges of the Realm. The opi nions of Martinez were rebuffed by the Grand Lodge of France, which ejected th is small sect from the heart of Constitutional Lodges, through a decision on December 12, 1765”. This surliness is badly conceived, since one may read at the head of the masonic review “The Acacia”, the offici al organ of the Grand Orient of France, the following phrase signed by the mason Limousin: “Freemasonry is anti-church; it is the Church of the Heretics”. We quickly pass on to the rare authors who, hostile to Martinism have, during the course of the XX th Century, attacked or cr iticized the Order and its founder. Critics are generally as brief as they have little authentic documentation. We now arrive at the XX th Century, where we find the works of Benjamin Fabre, who continues the tradition of Barruel, Le Franc, etc...who affirms that the “Martinist s” started the Revolution!

Setting this aside, “Franciscus Eques a capite galeato” is a well documented work. We will no longer omit the work of P. Vuilliaud, “The Lyon Rose-Croix in the XVIII th Century”. The author makes as many ironical observations as historical ones. He is hostile by r eason of religious conviction, and one should thank him for having only used irony and not hatred! Yet he was wise to avoid railing at the Rites. Had he forgotten that similar Rite existed in the very Church which was dear to him? Believing Catholics and non-believing Freemasons gain nothing by mocking their respective traditi ons. These things should exist above all squabbles, and the Symbols which are divine in origin, existing in higher “places”, are from there... Next comes the pamphlet (which was sold outside the anti-masonic exposition of 1941) whose author wa s René-Louis Jolivet, a barrister, and speaker on Radio-Paris during the German occupation. We are going to quote him in full, so that the r eading of it will so account fo r the bad faith of this sad person (who from his microphone, with a fi stful of German marks in his left hand, dared to call those Toulon officers, who pr eferred to sabotage their ships rather than see them delivered into foreign hands, “ traitors ”!). From “Secret Societies, Masonry and Judaism”, we quote this masterpiece of conscious manipulation: “In 1754, the Polish Jew, Martinez de Pasqually, founded his Order of Elus-Cohen (in Hebrew, Cohen means prie st), to which Jews were naturally admitted. (Where was this taken from? No document exists which discusses the presence of Jews in the Order...). “After the death of Martinez, Saint-Ma rtin and Willermoz become the main heads of this sect which took the name of ‘Martinism’. (We have already seen that Saint-Martin demitted in 1790...). “All this may be considered as the begi nning of a direct and positive link between the Jews and Secret Societies”. (But if Jews were admitted, why was this only the beginning of a link?...). “At the famous Convent of Wilhel msbad in 1782, Judaism was admitted into the Secret Societies, in fact and by ri ght”.

The famous English mason, John Toland, had already published in 1715 a writing whose title is significant: ‘Reasons for Naturalizing Jews in Great Britain’”. How wonderfully astute! At the beginning our author told us, with no proof whatsoever , that Martinez was Jewish! Then he conclud ed that, since the founder was, all the members must be too! So the Order had, by this sleight of hand, become integrally Jewish, with the Jews – acco rding to him – entering Freemasonry when the Order of the Elus-Cohen took part in the Convent of Wilhelmsbad!... And now, without a single hesitation, he tells us that English Lodges are favorable to Jews, even though no English Lodge took part in the famous Convent ! And he makes a mason of an author writing in 1715, even though Speculative Masonry in Europe dates from 1717 !... We end this review of foolishness or pious falsehoods by recalling an article from the Review “Masoni c Documents” from June 1942. The best is surely this: “Cagliostro had relations with and a considerable influence on the Jew Martinez de Pasquall y and Claude de Saint-Martin, founder of Martinism”. Now, Martinez was born in Grenoble in 1710, according to the research of Le Forestier, Van Rijnberk, etc....

At this time Martinez had already been for 3 years in Saint-Domingue, and he died in Port-au-Prince in 1774... It is hard to see the influence Cagliostro could have h ad on Martinez (who was made a jew 83 and not a Jew – Don Joachim Martinez Pasqually de la Tour, Squire...). As for Claude de Saint-Martin, all the influence that Cagliostro could have exerted over him can the summarized in this phrase, extracted from one of his letters and cited by Matter: “The mora l abjection of this man, etc...” He was talking of Cagliostro, whom he had met in Strasbourg...   82 According to the documents from the Tribunal of the Inquisition. 83 Enjuivé in the original text – PV."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"R.

Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 152 - NOTES ON THE “ARK OF TESTIMONY” ALSO CALLED THE “ARK OF THE COVENANT” We have always suspected that the “Cubic Stone”, that central monument around which all symbolic masonry turns, is not only the common emblem of the goal sought by material Alc hemy, or the symbo lic image of spirit ual Alchemy, or symbolic of the powers impar ted by the Creator to the Mage; but also – and above all – a real Ritual Object, which al lows the Forces summoned by the Mage to be set in motion, behind the veil of immediate reality. That is why, as Masonry knows, t he four sides of this Cubic Stone are covered with a compact network of Nu mbers and Letters, from which, with recourse to traditional keys, one can recover ”passwords” and “mysterious diagrams”. Understanding wh at is being concealed behind the “Cubic Stone”, and knowing how to put this into practice , is the necessary proof of a true Mage. To begin with, in the presence of letters and numbers, arranged on the sides according to strict laws, we can reflect on the possible connection with the Hebraic Kabbalah. The fact that this Stone, improperly called Cubic, is frequently finished with a Pyramidal shape on its top su rface, evokes the idea of a “gushing forth” of something towards the heavens . Also, the presence in a number of figures and engravings (in the Tarot, for ex ample) of a “divinit y” represented as sitting upon this Stone, suggests the secret “manifestation” of a Force imprisoned within this mysterious m onument, and its exteriorization by appropriate means. In another sphere, the Ar k of the Covenant of Is rael, under its true name of the “Ark of Testimony”, has often given birth among those Occultists who are fascinated by this historical enigma, to the idea of the possible “condensation” within the sides of the Ark – a simple box of gold-plated wood – of a formidable and intelligent Unknown Force. Certai n Occultists have even put forward the rather simplistic hypothesis that the gold-plated wooden box and the gold-woven vestments of the pontiff, s uggest a parallel with Volta’s battery! The reality is completely different. The Ark of Testimony is the first and unique “cubic stone” of Israel. This “Cubic Stone” is represented in the very heart of the masonic Lodge because the Lodge is the symbolic represent ation of the Temple at Jerusalem (including the columns of Jachin and B oaz, particularly Solomonic symbols, etc... Same tradition regarding the building: Hir am, etc). And herei n lies its enigma. ∴ To begin with, the Eternal One did not communicate and manifest Himself directly to Moses and his successo rs. It was His agent, the Angel: "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 153 - “Behold, I send an Angel to you, to protect you on the way and to bring you to the place which I have prepared. Take guard in his present, listen to his voice, and do not resist him, for he carries my Great Name...” (Exodus, Ch. XXIII, vv. 20, 21 and 22). The Angel in question can therefore be evoked by the Name of the Lord, since he also carries this name. Bu t he is not the Eternal One Himself. God came to dictate His laws to Mose s at Sinai, and at this time He did not hand over the Tablets of the Law. Qu ite the contrary. Moses himself wrote down all that God commanded him: “Moses wrote down all the words of the Eternal One..” (Exodus, Ch. XXIV). Then the text continues later on as follows: “The Eternal One then said to Moses: Climb up towards me upon the mountain, and remain there. I will give you tablets of stone, the law and the ordinances which I have written with thei r instruction...” (Exodus, Ch. XXIV, v. 12). One can see that the T ablets and the Ordinances are different things. We will see later what the T ablets really contained... Then comes the description of the Ar k with Moses must have constructed: “You will make an ark of acacia wood. It is to be two-and-a-half cubits long, its breadth one-and-a-half cubits, its height one-and-a-half cubits. “You will cover it with pure gold, you will cover it without and within and you will make a edging of gold all about. You will forge four golden rings for it and you will put these at t he four corners, two on one side and two on the other. You will make poles of acacia wood, and you will cover these with gold also. You will pass the poles through the rings of the ark, and these will serve to carry it. The poles will remain in the rings and they shall not be removed. “You will place the “Testimony” whic h I shall give you in the ark. “You will make a mercy-seat of pure gold, its length shall also be two-and- a-half cubits, its breadth one-and-a-half c ubits. You will make two Cherubim of gold, you will make them of beaten gold, at the two ends of he mercy-seat. Make one Cherub at one end, and one at the other . The Cherubim will stretch forth their wings above, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and will face one another. The Cherubim will have their face s towards the mer cy-seat.

It is there that I will meet with you, above the mercy-seat, between the Cherubims placed upon the ark of “Testimony”.” Later (Ch. XXXII, v. 18), the long di scourse and its prescriptions being ended, we then read: “When the Eternal One had finished ta lking to Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of Testimony, tabl ets of stone, written with the finger of God.” The Golden Calf was the reason that Moses broke these two first tablets. Here is the consequence: “The Eternal One said to Moses, hew two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write there the words which were on the first tablets which you broke...” “Moses was there with the Eternal One forty days and forty nights...And the Eternal One wrote on the tablets the word s of covenant, the ten words...Moses descended from Mount Sinai, having the tw o tablets of Testimony in his hand”. Then come the chapters related to the elaboration of the ri tual furniture, prescribed by God, an d their installation: “As the Eternal One has ordained...He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, he took the rods of the ark, and he placed the mercy-seat upon the ark. He carried the ark into the tabernacle, he put up the veil of separation, and he covered the ark of Testim ony as the Eternal One had commanded Moses. He placed the table in the tent of assi gnation, on the northern side of the Tabernacle.” (Exodus, Ch. XL). ∴ How were the “Tablets of Test imony” placed in the Ark? All depends upon their dimensions. The ark being two-and-a-half cubits long and one-and-a-half cubits broad, the T ablets could not be larger than these dimensions. But let us allow that they were as long and wide as this. Then what use would it be that the ark was one-and- a-half cubits high? These plaques of stone couldn’t have been as thick as that, since Moses wouldn’t have been able to carry them in his hands because of t heir weight! On the other hand, how can we allow that they were thin and that a ll that space in the ark was of no use? And why make the ark so large, and abov e all so high? And how can we allow that these plaques of st one might be thus left unsecur ed, and risk their surfaces being smashed by shaking about when the ark was carried?"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 155 - Only one arrangement is possible , that outlined in the diagram. The Tablets are as tall and broad as the ark: they are thus each square in form, being one-and-a-half cubits wide and one-and-a- half cubits tall. They are now upright, with a groove cut into the vertical sides. And when the singular cover of the ark which is the mercy-seat is pr operly placed on the box, an empty space is thus created between them. The respect demanded by the holiness of these tablets required that they be thus maintained upright, and that their su rfaces didn’t touch. For the holy text which they carried was distributed on both si des of each tablet, as is detailed in Exodus (Ch. XXXII, vv. 15 and 16): “Moses returned and descended from Mount Sinai, the two Tablets of Testimony in his hands. The two tablets were written on both sides, they were written on one and on the other side...” A significant error spread abroad suggests that they carried the commandments of God. This is false, since all the descriptions which carried the message of the Eternal One at Sinai we re written in Moses’ hand, and in a separate book : “Moses wrote all the words of the Et ernal One...He took the book of the Covenant, and read it in the presence of the people. They said: We will do all that the Eternal One has said, and we will obey...” This is from Exodus, Chapter XXIV, verses 4 to 8. And it is several verses later that the following is finally said: “Climb up again to Me on the mountain. And remain there. I shall give you the tablets of stone...” (Ch. XXIV, v. 11). Finally we see that, fo llowing the assent of the people to the prescriptions, it is the mark of the Covenant, the “Tes timony”, which God gave to His people. So we may conclude that, as in a ll Theurgic operations, where the Power which is evoked, registers its “seal”, its mark upon a metal plaque or on the virgin parchment of the Grimoire, as a sign of agreement, the G od of Israel finally gave him his signature, his agreement, by a “T estimony”, mysteriously engraved upon these Tablets of stone... ∴     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"R.

The agreement, the “pact” between the invoked Intelligence and the Magician is manifest by the former co mmunicating its magical “seal”, and the revelation of its “name”. These are the two prin cipal elements of the ritual of evocation. And this revelation is the “testimony” of trust which is afforded to the aforementioned Magician. The magical possession of the Name and Sigil is, for the Magician, the key ingredient of his success. All universal traditions agree on this fact. In our opinion, the “words” that the Eternal One engraved upon these Tablets were His Ten Names , keys to his personal evocation by Moses, Aaron and their legitimate successors. This is why there could only be one ark of the Covenant, and why one could only worshi p Elohim there, where the ark was situated . Later on, all other places of wo rship, both ancient and modern, would be condemned by the priests, closed in the name of the Law, as not intended for the true God of Israel ... ∴ These stone Tablets, engraved on both sides, were giant Talismans! A talisman is always covered with symbols on both sides. Magical equilibrium requires that one of the sides be attractive , the other repulsive .

These things will become clearer another day, in tuited from the Kabbalistic magic being practiced today. ∴ In popular magical tradition of old Ru ssia, there is a ritual called “Gadania”, which is usually per formed during the night of 9 th of January. It consists of putting two completely identic al mirrors facing each other, separated by two candles. The light from the candles is reflected to infinity in the mirrors, and the frames the same way. This causes a play of perspective allowing one to believe one sees a series of brightly-lit rooms. Right at the back, at the meeting of the progressively diminishing lights, a brilliant halo is formed. At midnight, young girls sit facing the magical mirror, and stare at the halo wit h beating hearts. After a short time, a miniscule silh ouette appears, far away. It slowly approaches, and soon the girls recognize the image of the m an they will later marry. One must refrain from drawing near to the image, and above all not to allow it to pass the next-to-last frames, for it is in reality a Demon who, led towards the real world, would enter our three dimensional universe, materialized by imprudence, and strangle the summoner in his talons in order to take possession of their soul. This ritual of “Gadania” is t he key to the Ark of Testimony. It is in the empty space between the two Tablets of stone, that the Occult Force evoked by Hebrew theurgy was generated and materialized. It resided in the Divine Names and the Holy Letters, contained within them . But through the mysterious combinations wh ich henceforth these hidden “Names of Power” and “Glyphs” offered, thus opposed and face to face, the Ark became a true psychic battery. The Tablets of stone acted as “poles”, and between them, by this very opposition was born what t he Eternal One called the Angel which led Israel. The Absolute was revealed, manifested, and t he hidden vehicle, the fluid required for this materialization, was born bet ween the Tablets of “Testimony”. Can the reader now understand why, in our opinion, these Tablets were face to face? And what was the spaci ng between them, if not that which would generate a perfect Cube? It was necessary that the other sides of the Tablets did not touch the front and back sides of the Ark, since these Tablets were written on both sides.     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"R.

This word evokes the great esoteric Tradition expr essed in the Kabbalah, that of the Ten Names corresponding to the Ten Sephiroth. One also knows that the God of Israel is triple, for he said: “God of Ab raham, of Isaac and of Jacob” each of these Gods corresponding to a different Divine Name.

However, in Hebrew, wri tten vowels do not exist, and the written word are only represented by consonants. It follows that the same word formed by consonants could be pronounced di fferently in spoken language. One of these consonants, ‘W’, could sound like an ‘OU’ or like a ‘V’. It was once the same in old French, where the ‘V’ was both an actual ‘V’ and also had the sound of ‘U’. In his “Paganism of the Hebrews Befo re the Babylonian Captivity”, E. Ferrière showed us that the concept of mo notheism saw light of day in Israel under the influence of Babylonian philosophy.

In fact, the consonant-word HVH, part mascu line, part feminine, is in itself a neuter form! When one wishes to determine it exclusively in the feminine, one must do this in one of two ways: a) One can place a “T” (Tau) in front, as a prefix, as T-HVH, which gives Tehouh or Tohouh. The Tohou-Bohou of Genesis, from which comes our term ‘Tohu-Bohu’. This is prim itive chaos, primordial disorganized, chaotic matter (Genesis I, 2) 85 . b) To determine the feminine of the second matter, one could place both ‘T’ (Tau) in front (prefix) and a ‘T’ behind (suffix): creating T (HVH) T, that is to say Thavath, primor dial matter, the Chaotic Mother 86 . Thavath is also called Tivathi and Taaut h, which are only modifications of the same name. Thavath or Taout h, is the feminine principle corresponding to the masculine princi ple Houd of the Chaldean Triad,. The Chaldean Thavath is identical to the Phonecian Bahou, and the Hebraic Tohu-Bohu 87 . * * * To determine the masculine equivalent of this neuter word of HVH, one puts an ‘I’ consonant in front, obt aining HIVH. This tetragram is hieroglyphically the same as the god of the Hebrews.

This is the question which is posed by a gnostic Kabbalist. Here is the response. 1. Théodoret tells us that the Samaritans, half-breeds, schismatic, pronounced the sacred Tetragra mmaton “Jahweh”. But it teaches us that the pure race of Israel, depository of religious orthodoxy, pronounced it “Iaoh” (o ther Greek form of “Iahouh”). 2. The god of the desert, the ear lier texts named, in Hebrew: “Eheieh” (“I Am”), Jahweh (“He is”), El Shaddai (“Strong All- Powerful”), Adonai (“Lord”). (E xodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, etc...). 3. Diodorus of Sicily tells us the Moses, received his Laws under the invocation of “Iahoh”. (Diodorus, I). 4. Valentinus, in the “Pistis S ophia”, the Gnostic classic, puts a particular prayer in the mouth of Jesus: “...After his resurrection, Jesus having his disciples around him, said this prayer: ‘Hear me, O my Father, Father of all fathers, Infinite Light, O Iehou Sabaoth...’”(Dictionary of the Apocrypha, I). 5. Here too is another Gnostic le tter: “Jesus turned towards the four corners of the world, wit h his disciples, all clothed in vestments of flax, said: ‘Iao, Iao, Iao, here is the meaning of this Name: the iota signifies that the Univ erse is emanated; the alpha , that it will return from whence it came; the omega , that this will be at the end of ends...’” (Dictionary of the Apocrypha, I). 6. The mystic formula of Iaoh, “Fat her of all fathers” was inscribed on amulets and abraxas which carried Gnostics, mainly women, wore. Witness this medallion: “Iao, Abraxas, Adonai, Holy Name, Favorable Power, keep Vible Pauline from all evil Demons...”(Dictionary of Christ ian Antiquities, by the Abbé Martigny). 7. For Saint Irenaeus, “Iaho is the true name of God, god and ineffable name that expresses the Tetragrammaton IHVH, and which the Greeks read as Iao”. Irenaeus adds that, in Gnostic initiations, the initiate responded to the priest: :I am confirmed and redeemed, I redeem my soul fr om this world, and the things of this world, in the Name of Iao, who redeemed the Soul of the World for salvation, in the living Christ”.     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 162 - For Irenaeus, imbued with the subtle ties of sacred phonetics, one should distinguish between Iaôth, with a long ‘ô’, designating the God who rules Matter (thr ough Weight, Number and Measure), and Iaoth (short ‘o’) representing the God of power separating the evil. 8. For Origen, Iahoh, or also Iah, was the name that Israel gave to God, “and also Sabaoth, Adonai (Lord), Elohi and all these names drawn from the Scriptures, are the characteristic Names of one sole and same God. (Origen: “A gainst Celsus”, VI). 9. Clement of Alexandria tells us : “At the entrance to the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Jerusale m, four columns carried the sacred Tetragrammaton... This Tetragra mmaton was read as Iahouh: He who was, is and shall be...(Clement: Stromates, V). 10. E. Ferrière, in his “Paganism of the Hebrews before the Captivity”, tells us that in the XII th Century, the tradi tion of the true pronunciation of the Hebrew Tetragr ammaton was still alive, as was attested by two Greek passages , one by the minor historian Zonaras, Secretary of State under the Comnenes, the other the poet grammarian Tzetes, born in Constantinople: a. Zonaras: “Iaoh is the name of the Saving God of the Hebrews (similar ot the prayer of the Pistis Sophia of Valentinus). b. Tzetes: “In Hebrew, Iahoh designates the Invisible God”. One should say ineffable without doubt, in opposition to a more materialistic demiu rge, closer to man. 11. For Macrobius, who placed the fo llowing words in the mouth of the Oracle of Apollo: “Say that the highest of the gods , the Supreme God, is Iaoh...”, the Iahoh of the Oracle is the solar divinity, as is explained later: “It is Him who in winter is called Orcus, in Spring Zeus, Helios in Summer and in Autumn the languid Iahoh...”. In fact it is the Sun which is the god- type for all the Semites. The Ark is doubled and covered with gold, the robe and or naments of the pontiff, woven and mixed with gold, and the adversaries of Israel know that they have an interest in attacking the People of the plain, the high places being those of th eir god”. (Macrobius, Saturnales, I). 12. Jean Laurentius, VI th Century, better know by the name of Lydus, who wrote under Justinian, tells us in his “Treaty of the Months”, that: “the Chaldeans call the Supr eme God Iaoh, that is to say Intelligible Light. In the Phoenecian language, he is often called Sabaoth, as being He who is above the Seven Heavens , that is to say the Creator of the Wo rld”. (De Mensibus, IV). 13. These definitions are confirm ed by the Babylonian inscriptions, finally deciphered today: “The God of Intelligent Light is called Hou, Hea or Ao. A king portrays his name as: Il-nour-Hou”.

Thus Martinez de Pasqually drew all his operat ive rituals from the prescr iptions of Henry Cornelius Agrippa in his “Occult Philosophy”, in the first three books rather than the fourth, which is generally considered to be wrong. For Dom Pernetty, the rites by which the “Illumined of Avignon” conversed wit h the Holy Word and the Angel Assaïbi was remarkably similar to those described by the “Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage”; and all come under the basic influenc e of the sacerdotal prescriptions given in Leviticus, Exodus and Deuteronomy. Western Magic in its gothic and medieval form is impregnated with Judaic Kabbalah and Arabic traditions. And these are the same basic elements which codified and inspired all the Solomonic Clavicles welcomed to the bosom of the m edieval grimoires, t hemselves inspirers and theurgic formularies of the XVIII th Century. As for the common basis grouping together the seals, glyphs, signs, pantacles, emblems or cryptographs, the “Verga Aurea”of the monk J.-B. Heptburn gives them to us, explaini ng moreover that these are only the hieroglyphs contained long ago in the ol d “Book of Charms” of the Cyranid priests 88 . This perpetuity of tradition has thus authorized us to establish a synthesis of the custom of the legitimate and r egular successors of the Elus-Cohen of Martinez de Pasqually, certain t hat the experimenters and committed practitioners of High Magic must gain such an operative teaching. En fact, behind the usual, exclusively ritualistic setting, is found the arcane director of all Theurgy: Orison, or Prayer. The l ong period of training, the tenacious asceticism that the Adept of the High Sciences agrees to follow for many months, rests entirely in Faith, s upported by the Love of the divine. This Faith and this Love translate into holy Orisons, carefully graduated in such a manner that the text translates the state of the soul of the Operator while stirring him up . So, in the course of this patient teaching, the Theurgist effects a true impregnation on himself. He wakes, and maintains within himself an interior fire whose spiritual level is situated far above this interior fire, half-spiritual, half- material, which oriental doctrines also claim able to waken in man. But this presents a serious inconvenience, as it wa kes a violent sexual surge in the Adept which he must first curb, steer, then trans mute, as the Wester n technique works on other planes, reaches other states of consciousness and maintains them  88 It is from this work, reproduced in our time by M. de Mély, that we have borrowed all the medallions in this present book."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"R.

The Choice of Place The Operation lasts for six lunar cycles, and runs from the Néoménies 89 of Spring to that of Autumn. This is what Martine de Pasqually names “our year”. For the Elus-Cohen the year was six mont hs long, running from one equinox to the next. It is suitable to select the plac e where one will operate during the six months which follow at the outse t, that is to say, a little before Easter. If one lives in the country, in a remote place, one has the choice of selecting a small forest with spaces and clusters of trees. In a clearing, set up a sm all altar of turf, covered with an edifice of twigs. On the altar, one places the Lamp and the Censer. The Lamp must remain constant ly lit during the six lunar cycles. Around the altar, seven steps away, prepare a low pile of flowers, grass and green shrubs, so that this hedge clearly separat es the consecrated space form the rest of the wood. The altar is in the circle; outside is the “profane wo rld”. It helps, if this is possible, if the wood is situated at the top of a small hill or an elevation. If one lives in town, one should select a house endowed with an adjacent terrace, preferably covered and with whit e pine flooring. The adjacent terrace and the small room should have a coveri ng of river sand, fine and clean, to a depth of two fingers. The altar will be erected in the center of the Oratory. It could be of wood, and present the aspect vertically of a doubl e cube, the height of a cubit and a half (one meter). The altar destined for an outside Operation c an be of unfinished stones, set up to form a rough cube. In the Oratory, one should set aside an armoire destined to hold the Vestments and sacred Objects, as well as reserves of ingredients: oil, charcoal, incense, etc... In case of difficulty in achieving all these conditions, one should do one’s best to do as much as possible.   89 Néoménie = New Moon - PV."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"R.

In the ritual of the Elus-Cohen, the Operator is bare-headed. In the ritual of Avignon, he wears a “low” gilded miter. In the ritual of Abramelin, the Op erator wears a band about the forehead, a hand’s width wide, in crimson and gold silk. The Operator who follows the prescripti ons of Dom Pernetty (Ritual of the “Illuminated of Avignon”) also carrie s upon his low miter, a triangular golden plaque (or, at a pinch, silver) on which is engraved in Hebrew characters the word “KAES” (Kaph, Aleph, Heh, Shin) 92 . It would be a good idea to have a clean white housecoat, of linen or flax, which one wears to enter the Oratory and is reserved for this use. It could be kept in the armoire when one dons t he ritual clothing described above. These costumes are completed by a pai r of Sandals, of cord esparto or coarse linen.

Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A.

This is required according to the particular religion of t he Operative (Jewish or Christian), in a communion service enacted according to the rites of the Adept. So one may indifferently communicate in a synagogue, a church, a temple, or alone, with a few Brothers, etc... The ri te itself depends on the religion (paschal lamb for the Jews, host for Catholics, bread and wi ne for reformed or Greek rites, etc...). * * * The first morning following Easter, having thoroughly washed or bathed, having put on new vestments or the housec oat mentioned in the present Ritual, enter the Oratory a quarter of an hour before sunrise. Kneel in front of the altar and, faci ng the window or door leading to the terrace, invoke the Name of the Lord. Thank Him for his grace, abase yourself, and ask His pardon for your faults and errors, implore His benevolence and his kindness in sending you his Ho ly Angel, who may serve as you guide in the True Way, dispelling all sins of oversight, ignorance and weakness. This prayer is to be repeated each morning at dawn throughout the two lunar cycles, even if the Operative is si ck. Conjugal rights are permitted during these two months. Each Sabbath (being Saturday for Jews, Sunday for Christians, and Friday for Moslems), cense the altar, and change vestments for the day having brushed and perfumed t hem. Give alms or a charit able act during the course of the day. B) The Second Two Moons Same ritual, but the prayer is r epeated in the evenings, a quarter of an hour before sunset, which makes two prayer each day. Before each of them, purify the face and hands with lustral water. The twice-daily Orison for these two months should be longer than that used in the first two lunar cycles. One should spend longer asking for grace to"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 171 - enter the True Way, to one day achi eve true wisdom and knowledge by the intermediation of the Holy Angels. One may still engage in conjugal rights during these two moons. Each Sabbath eve wash or bathe thoroughly, and clear the vestments or brush and perfume them. That day one should take no food between the rise and setting of the Sun, and abstain from living t oo finely or abundantly. Fasting is recommended. On the day of the Sabbat h, perform the same actions as for the first two moons. C) The Last Two Moons In these two last months before the Grand Evocation, perform three prayers in place of the two. These ta ke place a quarter of an hour before dawn, a quarter of an hour before noon, and a quarter of an hour before sunset. Wash the face and hands with lustra l water upon entering the Oratory, and before reciting the holy orisons, say a pray er of confessions and for the pardon of sins. Ardently ask the Lord for grace to enj oy and bear the presence of the Holy Angels, and ask Him to deign, through their mediation, to give us the secret knowledge. The prayer is thus longer t han those of the previous two moons. When lighting the incense before each prayer , do not forget to use a brief prayer to dedicate this censing to the Name of t he Lord, to His glory; and pray the Holy Angels to be present and henceforth assist at the Operations during these two moons. It is best to pray with the heart. For that, study the Holy Scriptures, and the Eternal One will illumine the mind of t he Operator to this end, and the Holy Spirit will penetrate you little by little. Coitus is forbidden in these last two lunar months. General Prescriptions Live as alone as you can; avoid bec oming angry during these six months. After the main meal, study the Holy Scriptures and the Kabbalah for about two hours. After morning prayer, one may sl eep a little more if desired. The only thing one must not do at any price is to interrupt the daily Orisons. The room in which one sleeps sh ould if possible be adjacent to the Oratory. It should be clean and neat, but avoid all profane objects or decoration.     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"R.

These prescriptions should be followed throughout the six moons. * * * Regarding the prayers, one will carefully note that the orisons for the first two months (lunar cycles of Aries and Taur us) are preparatory prayers. One asks the Lord to send you His Holy Angel , in order to guide you in the True Way. And to protect you from failure. In the orisons of the second following lunar cycles (Gemini and Cancer), you ask God to instruct you through His Holy Angels . In the two last moons (Leo and Virg o), you ask the Lord to give you the strength to rejoice in the presence of his Holy Angels, to have the strength of soul to bear this presence , and to grant you through their meditation , the secret knowledge, and to the Angels themselves, to be present and assist the Operator , even when invisible. Finally, at the time of the Grand Evocation, you ask only for their appearance, under one form or another (face, human silhouette, lorry, supernatural light, etc...) D) The Consecration After the two last lunar cycles are co mplete, the Operator had come to the end of his long ascetic period. The Néoméni e of the Autumnal Equinox, time and date of the Grand Evocation, begins. The morning of the first day of the Lunat ion of Libra, pray like the previous evening, but barefoot. As usual place coals in the censer and dress in the prescribed Vestment, placi ng the almond Wand lengthways upon the altar and, in front of the Wand, the fl ask of Oil of Unction. Throw a large amount of Incense on the coals, kneel and pray thus: “O Lord, God of Mercy, Patient God, Most Blessed, Most Bountiful and Wise, Who grants Your grace in a t housand ways and generations, Who forgets the iniquities, sins and transgressions of men, in Whose Presence none are found innocent, who visits the failures of the fathers on the children and the descendants unto the third and fourth gener ation, I knew my wretchedness and know that I am not worthy to come bef ore your Divine Majest y, nor to implore and pray Your Goodness and Mercy for the least grace...Nevertheless, Lord of Lords, take pity on me. Remove all in iquity and malice from me. Wash all impurity of sin from my soul. Renew Y our Spirit within me. Let me understand the mysteries of Your Grac e and the treasures of our Wisdom! Sanctify me with"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 173 - the Oil of Your sanctification, with which You purified Your Prophets. Sanctify in me all that belongs to me, so that I may become worthy to converse with Your Holy Angels, and may Your Divine Sapience at last grant me the power given to Your Prophets over all impure sp irits. Amen, amen, amen.” Then rise, anoint the middle of your forehead with a little oil of unction. Then, having plunged the firs t three fingers of your righ t hand in the Oil, anoint the four upper corners of the altar, the pieces of ri tual costume, the waist-band, the miter or the headband, and the almond Wand, on both sides. Then, do the same to the door and the window, if t here is one. Final ly, with the fingers covered with oil, trace these words on the four sides of the altar: “In whatever place, where My Name shall be commemorated, I shall come to you and bless you”. The consecration is ended. Lay out the Objects and Vestments, kneel again and pray with the heart (The Object s should never leave the Oratory during these six months). Henceforth, the Operator will go barefoot in the Oratory. E) About the Angelic Summons The day following the consecration of the altar, before dawn, get up early. Do not proceed as usual, with lustral ablutio ns. Dress in Vestments of mourning, and, barefoot, enter the Orator y. Take some coals fr om the Censer from the previous evening and mark the forehead and hair with ash. Now place fresh coals in the Censer then, returning to the threshold, prostrate yourself, face to the ground, fists crossed beneath the head, which is covered with a black veil. Here the ritual of Abramelin prescribes a rite which is not found in that of the “Illumined of Avignon” nor the Elus-Cohen. However, it appears in the analogous ritual of “Mystic Masonry”. This rite consists of bringing a child, aged 6 to 8 years old, dressed in white, wearing a transparent white silk veil upon the head covering the eyes, into the Oratory. Duly t aught beforehand, the child approaches the altar, puts Incense in the Censer and then kneels befor e the altar. The child prays, using prayers appropriate to his or her age. During this time the Operator prays fervently, humiliating himself before God and the Celestial Court, supplicating the Angel who is present, although invisible, to manifest himself to the child, and to leave a pantacular “sign” as an indicati on of his passing, and of the “means” of future communication. Do not look at t he altar, and pray with the greatest fervor one can muster since, for the Operator who has scrupulously fo llowed this Ritual for six months, who has a pure soul and right intention, this Ritua l must inevitably lead to success. The Angle will manife st himself by means of an apparition, usually an extraordinarily luminous “glory”, accompanied by a indescribable odor     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"R.

When the apparition has disappeared, leave the Oratory without t ouching the objects on the altar. Do not go back into the room that day; talk to nobody about the phenomenon just witnessed, and avoid replying to the child who you should now di smiss. Continue to fast until the sun sets, then immediately a fterwards, go to bed alone. If you are following the usual rite, there is no virgin child, and the Operator remains rigorously alone, performi ng all the actions described earlier. The day following this ceremony, if one has uniquely benefited from the appearance of a luminescent “glory” and th e perception of an extra-terrestrial odor, then continue the ceremony in the manner described below. Before daybreak go to the Oratory, light the Censer and throw a large pinch of Incense on the glowing coals. Once more, in mourning Vestments, head covered with a black veil, prostrate yourse lf at the entrance, ask the Lord God to grant you a vision of the Holy Angels. Pray that the Celest ial Spirits will grant you their intimate presence, This pray er should continue (repeated or continued in a variety of ways) for about two or th ree full hours. At midday, one should pray for another hour. In the evening, at suns et, another hour. One fasts all day, only taking food when the Sun sets. When the third day has finally arriv ed, having bathed or washed all over, enter the Oratory, barefoot, light and f ill the Censer with coals and Incense. Kneeling before the altar give thanks to the Lord of Heaven, asking him for the help of the Holy Angels in the Magica l Operation being perf ormed. Then, the Angel set over you as y our guardian will finally appear. Talismanic Medallions A conversation in which no words resonate in the silence, where everything is intuitively and spiritually perceived and expressed: such is the essence of the ecstasy into which the Oper ator is plunged. You have no idea of the time elapsed, for the excellent reas on that you are no longer of this world during the time of the appearance. "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 175 - You will not interrupt this mystic meet ing yourself: besides, you couldn’t if you tried. Consciousness of what has happened slips away. The Angel, or the “glory” which he manifests, where all hier oglyphic “signs” radiate in space, in front of you, behind you, at the right of the altar, becom e blurred. The Operator regains consciousness of the place and t he time. You leave without touching anything. In the evening, offer another pr ayer of thanks, for about an hour. The following day, fourth day of the pr inciple Operations, enter the Oratory again, light the Censer, put on the Vestment described at the beginning of this Ritual. This done, pray God that he will give you His grace, so that the Operations will always be to His glory. Pray to y our Angel then, Wand in the right hand, ask God to give it the power which he gave of old to the Wands of Moses, Aaron, Elias and the other Patriarc hs and Prophets. Once this consecratory prayer is ended, set aside the Wand. Later, each time you want the company the Guardian Angel, when you need his counsel s or his light, after each prayer before the altar, trace in t he air before you the glyph which he indicated to you on the first day of his manifestation. This will be sufficient for him to hear your call. 1 st Additional Note An Operator who is accustomed to straightforward ceremonial Magical Operations, would have been astonished by t he ritualistic simplicity reigning over the preparation of the alm ond Wand, whereas the Wand in regular Clavicles is generally covered with a layer of engrav ed red copper, encircled with rings of gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, etc... and it is also prescribed never to leave the ends free: they must either be covered by magnetic balls, or sealed with virgin wax. The almond Wand in the Ritual of Abra melin or that of the “Illumined of Avignon” is purely symbolic. It is the tangi ble “witness” of the real powers which the long asceticism of six months has l egitimately procured for the persevering Adept. That is to say that it draws it s power only from that which he inwardly discovered in his Theurgic work. Whoev er has the least doubt about the value of his interior work, and the value of t he Wand, is diminished in the same proportion 93 . The symbolism of the almond is as follo ws. It is the “wood of Angels” for the Kabbalists of yore. Now, the Hebrew word “ shaked ” signifies “almond” and the Hebrew word “ shakad ” denotes “watcher”. So this nuance ( shaked or shakad ) can only be found in Hebrew which us es masoretic points.

The “almond” ( shaked ) is the tree of “t hose-who-watch” ( shakad ), that is to say the Angels, whom the Book of Enoch calls the “Watchers of Heaven”. It is the Wand the Gods of the Armies of Heaven , Elohim Tzabaoth, required of its Priests. In hermetic symbolism, the almond is t he symbol of Birth, earthly Birth as well as celestial Birth. Hence the candies at baptism 94 . Its fruit easily evokes the feminine sex, containing the future seed: the Child. It is the tree of the Virgin Mother, and Mary is often depicted in the middle of an almond (see Notre Dame of Paris), because she is the Virgin Mother, and because she is also the “Queen of the Angels”, the Queen of the Watchers of Heaven. Finally, with its silver foliage and its green fruit, it is the Venusian-Lunar tree par excellence. For Jewish Kabbalists or Arab Magicians it evokes the Star of David; and the Pentagram (linked to the color green) which surmounts the Crescent moon (linked to the color silve r). It is the si gn of Chance and Good Fortune. But above all the almond tree is the tree which seeks the light . Frequently blossoming during Spring, befor e the fast frosts have passed, it hastens to see the solar rebirth in rea lizing the symbol of the Sage who confronts death with no fear, in order to sooner see the hoped-for Life. Aurifer. 2 nd Additional Note In the Ritual of Abramelin (from “The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage”), a specific role falls to a child . Here is the text of the ritual: “The morning following the Consecrati on, rise at an early hour. Do not wash; dress in clothes of mourning; enter the Oratory barefoot. Go to the side of the Censer, and take ashes from it, placi ng them on the head. Light the Lamp. Place glowing coals in the Censer. Open the window; retu rn to the door and there prostrate yourself, face to the ground. Tell a child, 6, 7 or 8 years old at most, dressed in white, wearing a wh ite silk veil, fine and transparent which covers the forehead down to the eyes, to enter the Oratory, to place fire and Incense in the Censer, and to kneel before the altar, on which one will have placed a silver Plate . One’s own head is covered with a black veil and, humiliating oneself with the greatest fervor before God and His Celestial Court, one prays the Angel to show himself to t he child, by giving the child a “sign” on the silver Plate . Do not look at the altar and pray with great fe rvor until there  94 I assume the French make use of sugared al monds in their baptisms, as the Orthodox use them in their weddings - PV."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"R. Ambelain – Le Martinisme (1946) Translated by Piers A. Vaughan (2002) - 177 - appears an extraordinary splendor, acco mpanied by an indescribable odor. Then the child will see the Angel. Then pray the Angel to “sign” and to write the sign of its “summons” on the silver Plat e, together with all the instructions necessary to its future appearance. T hen the Angel disappears, but the splendor remains. The child must carry the silver Plate . Then leave the Oratory leaving the window open, and the Lamp lit. Do not enter the room again that day; speak to nobody, and avoid replying, even to the child who one now dismisses”. This is evidently referring to a real Child , analogous to that (or rather to those), used by Cagliostro as a m edium to detect symbolic scenes in his celebrated crystal decant er filled with magnetiz ed water, which he then interpreted. But it is probable that the child in question must be “prepared” according to an appropriate ritual. It must be pure, both morally and physically. That is to say, in warmer countries (the Ritual comes mainly from Arabic inspiration), there would be no question of a young boy or girl of 8 having already lost their physical virginity, taking into account their ul tra-precocious education. Above all, the child must be gifted with a natural ability to ‘see’ , or be – like those used by Cagliostro – plunged into somnambulistic sleep . Here the silver plate performs the o ffice of a “magic mi rror”, and it is probable that this Plate should be poured out, cut and consecrated according to an appropriate ritual. It is probable that the primit ive text envisaged a simple visualization , - in this “mirror”, - of the Angel’s seal, an im age which the child must then describe to the Master conducting the O peration. We believe that any other appropriate material, in the absence of a silver Plat e, may be used: notably a plate of virgin wax, virgin sheep or cow skin, etc... The appearance of a “seal” upon a material body is described in the Old Testament: the episode of the “Tablets of Law”: “And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tabl ets of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God”. ( Exodus XXXI, 18 ). “And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the t ables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written”. ( Exodus XXXII, 15 ). It is incorrect to see a legislative text in these Tablets of stone, written with the very finger of Elohim, which Mose s contemplated on the mountain, which summarized the long prescriptions that God gave in a living voice to his representative. These prescriptions covered twelve chapters of Exodus, and are     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"R.

It is al so a vain exercise to simply see the engraving of Ten Commandments t here, for the text is very precise, and it is only the imagination of exegetes who believed t hey saw the story of the ten principle prescriptions there; in reality, it is a completely different matter. In chapter XXV of Exodus, paragraphs 16 and 17, the Eternal One, having given his instructions fo r the construction of the Ark of the Testimony , a little box two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits high and wide, tells us the following: “And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee”. Now, we read earlier that the “Testimony ” in question were the two tablets. Why this expression? Because these pla ques of stone will be, for Moses and the People, the decisive and peremptory proof of the reality of the marvel! Contemplating the Tablets, Moses, coul d never, ever, with the procession of time, doubt the basis of his mission, and its mementos! Never would the theurgist be able to believe that he had dreamed it! The “Tablets” would be there, as a testimonial, through the super natural imprint they had received, that IHVH had truly manifested, right before the leader of Israel. The text of Exodus explains that they were “written on both sides”. This gives us ten commandments distributed on f our sides! This is neither easy nor harmonious. But if one is wil ling to acknowledge that they behaved like two stone Pantacles, everything becomes clear. For all Pantacles have two sides, both engraved with appropriate symbols. If two “Tablets” – that is to say, a double “Testimony” – were necessary, it is because, as Genesis tells us (Chapter I), Elohim is a “double” god: “God made Man in his own image, male and female created he them”. Hence the expressions of “the left hand” and “the right hand” of God. This duality is recalled in the two Cherubim which in the words of Chapter XXV of Ex odus (18, 19), must stretch their wings above the Ark, and the Mercy Seat of pure gold which dominated it. Proof that t he presence of the Eternal One, God of Israel, was linked to the two “Pantacles” which are the two “Tablets”, is also in Exodus, which tells us: “And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark: and in the ark though shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. “And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from betw een the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will gi ve thee in commandment unto the children of Israel”. ( Exodus, XXV, 21, 22 ).

For there, where the Ark is, there is the Elohim : “Thou shalt make a Sanctuary, and I shall live there, among you...” * * * This traditional prescription, implying a “place of manifestation” for the evoked Deity, is common in ceremonial magic of all traditions, be it Western, Eastern, Antique, Medieval or Modern. It is the function of “mandalas” and “y antras” as much as pantacles or “circles”. This is why the “Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage” foresaw the necessary presence of a Plate of pure silver, impregnated and “signed” by the Angel, as a prerequisite condi tion of later manifestation. We find this rule also in the tradition in which the “Grimoir es” were written, in the Operator’s hand upon virgin parchment, and where the demons evoked imposed their “signature” upon each of the pages attributed to them. There, Sorcery, Magic and Theurgy came together in a total ritual identification. * * * Regarding the role peculiarly reserved to young children, in certain sacerdotal functions, here is what we are told by the “Book of Judges” ( XVII, 1 to 6 ). “And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah. “And he said unto his mother, The el even hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be though of the Lord, my son. “And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedic ated the silver unto the Lord from my hand for my son, to make a graven image a nd a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. “Yet he restored the money unto hi s mother, and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, w ho made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and th ey were in the house of Micah.     \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b \u001b \u001b \u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e \r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e \u0002\u0002"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"R.

This entity is represented in an Oratory (“And the m an Micah had an house of gods”), which was a chapel for two different obje cts, one graven and the other molten. * * * There, too, the metal used was silver. It acted in a double representation: there were two teraphim, ju st as there were two C heubim, and two Tablets of “Testimony”. One of the teraphim wa s male. That was the one which was graven , also symbolically recalling the mode ling of Adam, the First Man, by the very hands of the Eternal O ne. The other teraphim was poured , recalling the creation of Eve, Woman, i ssued from Adam by dividi ng into two. The first teraphim is evidently the mould used for the second. So we may conclude that, in the Ritual of Abramelin the Mage, the child is a real one, and it is not necessary to seek some other name through a Kabbalistic value or number with the aid of Gematria, Temurah or Notarikon, as little will be revealed by this; any more than to imagine that the child and the pantacle (both em blematic of “ mediation ” between the Evoker and the Evoked) are one and the same thing. There is clearly a real child used in the Ceremony, and a silver Plate to receive the angelic “seal” upon the altar. Aurifer 3 rd Additional Note It is possible that the almond branch, which Elip has Lévi associates with the Great Key of Solomon (the Hexagram in a pantacle), in Theurgic Operations cited in the “Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage”, and the Rit ual of Avignon (the “Illumined” of Dom Pernetty), is act ually a mistake, coming from a poor translation of Scripture. In fact, in similar Ceremonies, Martinez de Pasqually and the ritual of the Elus -Cohen proscribes a Sword or Wand, requiring instead the use of a wax Candle .

Sometimes one reads: “The word of the Lord came to me with the question: What do you see, Jeremiah? “ I see a rod of an almond tree”, I replied. Then the Lord said to me: Well have you seen, for I am watching to fulfill my word 95 ”. On other occasions it is translated: “I replied: Lord, I see a rod of an almond tree . The voice replied: Well have you seen. For I am a Rod which watches for the fulfillment of my Words...” Now, the rod which watches is incontestably a Candle. Around the Christian altar, Candles symbolize the A ngels of the Celestial Court, and the two candles which must made of beeswax (acco rding to the Canon), on either side of the vertical crucifix, are the two great Archangels. And the Book of Enoch calls the Angels the “watchers of Heaven”.  95 In this case the words in the King James Bibl e do not illustrate the point Ambelain is trying to make, so I have used the New American Bible. In terestingly the verse actually reads: “I see a branch of the watching-tree, I replied”. The footnote goes on to say: “The watching-tree: the almond tree, which is the first to blossom in the springtime as though it had not slept.

If the fates of our Civili zations are weighed in the celestial balance, where one plate carries the seal of Providence , and the other that of Fatality , perhaps somewhere in the shadows of a sacred cr ypt, or behind the walls of a legendary castle, or apparently mingling with the Crowd, are the Unkn own Masters who, having a presentiment of the cruel game this balance plays, by means of decisive conflicts in a titanic combat, someti mes throw upon the plates the decisive weights of their mysterious action and wisdom . So says V. E. Michelet in “The Secret of Knighthood”. So the World has its secret protec tors. Even among the adversaries, the most hardened rationalists suspect the work of this white Militia, harassing and pushing poor, fainting humanity forward without ceasing, upon the rugged path of a luminous Becoming. If, occasionally, the teachings of these mysterious cohorts reaches the indifferent masses in concretized fo rm, and also in more abstract ways, awakening in the breast a saving and positiv e backwash. This is why, in the Middle Ages for example, in spite of the apparent return of dark Entities, the esoteric Corporations of builders su cceeded in introducing an echo of the Lost Word in the secular silence of the great got hic capitals, or in the pure light of the “rose windows” bathing the transepts of our Cathedrals with a unr eal spirituality, giving a message later understood, in r andom centuries, by some predestined mystics. “The Secret” has been associated with the cycles of military Knighthood and all its Orders, legendary or historic. If the walls of the fabled castle of King Arthur at Camelot concealed the mystery of the Companions of the Table Round, so Clement V similarly threw his white papal mantle over the red cross which clothed the Templars....” 96 . * * * This “secret” which secretly lives in each Order, was that of complete esoteric ordination. Why has nobody had ever asked why King François I, was not yet received as a knight at Marignan?

Symbolism, Mysticism, Esoteric ism, Occult Activity, Secrecy... From military Knighthood to crafts men’s Corporations, the same mold codified all medieval in stitutions. It is in the same spirit of transport towards the Infinite that artisan and gentleman a like expressed the greatness of their reciprocal duties. For one as for the ot her, “to do good” was the same as prayer; and the “Grail Quest” and the finishing of a “masterpiece” were similarly parallel roads. In the shadows, silently completing this triad of the Ideal, and coming finally to mystic Knighthood, that sa me which had above all for an emblem the Cross and Rose (that red rose whic h haunted Descartes...), sometimes the Golden Dragon attributed to the mythic Merlin.
