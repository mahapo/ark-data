[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"1 1 THE MM' S BOO K by J.S.M. Ward PRE FACE THE third d egree in Freemasonry is term ed the Sublime Degree and the title is truly justified. Even in its exoteric aspect its s imple, yet dramatic, power m ust leave a lasting impression on the mind of every Candidate its esoteric meaning contains s ome of the most profound spiritual instruction which it is possible to obtain to - day. Even the average man, who entered The Craft with little realization of its real antiquity and with the solemnity of this, its greatest de gree. In its directness and apparent simplicity rests its tremendous power. The e xoteric and esoteric are interwoven in such a wonderful way that it is almost impossible to separate the one from the other, and the longer it is s tudied the more we realize t he profound and ancient wisdom concealed therein. Indeed, it is probable that we shall never m aster all that lies hidden in this degree till we in very truth pass through that reality of which it is a a llegory. The two degrees which h ave gone before, grea t and b eautiful though they be are but the training and p reparation for the message which the third d egree holds in almost every line of the ritual. Here at length we learn the true purpose of Freemasonry. It is not merely a system of morality veiled in al legory and illustrated b y symbols, but a great adventure, a search after that which was lost; in other words, the Mystic Quest, the craving of the Soul to comprehend the nature of God and to achieve union with Him. Different men vary g reatly; to some the most profound teachings appeal, while to o thers s impler and more direct instruction is all they crave. But there is hardly a man who has not, at some time or other, amid the turm oil and distraction of this material world, felt a strange and unaccountable l onging for knowledge as to why he was ever sent here, whence he came, and whither he is wending. At such times he feels Like a wanderer in a strange land, who has almost forgotten h is native country, because he left it so long ago, but yet vaguely realizes that he is an exile, and d imly craves for some message from that home which h e knew of yore. This is the voice of the Divine Spark in man calling out for union with the Source of its being, and at such times the third d egree carries with it a message whi ch till then, perhaps, the brother had not realized. The true secrets are lost, but we are told how and where we shall find them. The gateway of d. opens the way to the p. within the c., where the longing spirit will find p eace in the arm s of the Father of All. Thus it will be seen that the third d egree strikes a more solemn n ote thane even that of d. itself, and I have e ndeavored in this little book to convey in outline form some part at least of this s ublime message. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 2 As in my previous books, I freely c onfess that I have not covered the whole ground. Not only would it be impossible to do so in a book of this s ize, but in so doing I should have defeated one of my principal objects in writing namely, to inspire others to study for themselves and endeavor t o find in our ceremonies further and d eeper m eanings.

From the number of letters I have received from all parts of the world, thanking me for the light these books throw on the meaning of our ceremonies, it is c lear that t he new members who are e ntering our Order are tending to take an increasing interest in the meaning of our Rites and are no longer content to regard the Ceremonies merely as a pastime for an idle hour.

Cockburn, W.Bro. Ward has lost no time in supplying his large circle of r eaders with this little book on the 3 d egree. With becoming reverence he touches on the last great lesson which Masonry presents to the mind of the Craftsman. Among the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 3 manifold b lessings that Freemasonry has c onferred on mankind none is greater than that of taking the sting from death and robbing the grave of victory. No man can be called Free who lives in dread of the only event that is c ertain in his life. Until emancipated from the fear of death, he is all his life long subject to bondage. Yet how miser ably weak is this phantom king of Terrors who enslaves s o many of the uninitiated. As Francis Bacon remarked, there is no passion in the mind of man that does not master the dread of death. Revenge triumphs over it; love slights it; honor aspireth to it; g rief flieth to it. Death h as always been regarded as the e lucidation of the Great Mystery. It was only at the promise of dissolution that the seeker after the Elixir of Life e xclaimed Eureka. Masonry regards death but as the gate of life, and the Master Ma son learns to look forward with firm but humble confidence to the moment when h e will receive his s umm ons to ascend to the Grand Lodge above. Brother Ward very properly attaches much significance to the Pass Word leading to the 2 d egree and 3 d egree. In t he Eleusinian Mysteries an ear of corn was presented to the Epoptai. This, as an emblem of Ceres, represented b y the S.W., is appropriate to the F.C.'s, who are under the guidance of that officer, while the name of the first artificer in metals, which is r eminiscent of Vulcan, the Celestial Blacksmith, seems s pecially befitting to the attributes of the J.W., as it was in the days before 1740 . The author sees in the lozenge form ed b y two of the great lights a representation of the Vesica Piscis. This s ymbol, whose literal meaning is \"the bladder of the fish,' is of deep significance. Some see in it the e ssential scheme of ecclesiastical architecture. But as the spiritually blind are unable to discern similitudes, so those who are gifted with deep insight are apt to o ver estimate analogies. The Vesica Piscis being, as Brother Ward rightly states, a feminine e mblem, and therefore one sided, can h ardly represent the equilibrium attained b y the conjunction of the square and compasses. These respectively stand for the contrasted correlatives which pervade Creation, and, like the pillars, are typical when conjoined of new stability resulting from their due proportion in the various s tages of Evolution. The progressive disclosures of the points of the compasses s eems to indicate the ultimate realization of the spirituality of matter; the at - one - ment and reconciliation at which Freemasonry and all true religions aim. Brother Ward repeatedly points out the similarity that exists between the lessons of Christianity and of Freemasonry. It is indeed difficult t o distinguish between them, The Ancient Mysteries undoubtedly possessed in secret many of the truths proclaimed in the gospel. St. Au gustine affirm s that Christianity, although n ot previously known by that name, had al ways existed. But whereas the hope of imm ortality was form erly in the Mysteries c onfined to a favored few, the new Covenant opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers. Incidentally this little volume clears up many passages which are obscure in the Ritu al. For example, there could b e no o bject in directing that t he F.C's, who, on account of their trust - worthiness, were selected b y the King to search for the Master, should b e clothed in white to prove their inn ocence. That was already beyond question. The order was evidently meant for the repentant twelve who took no actual part in the crime. This and similar inconsistencies in the Ritual may be accepted as evidence of its antiquity. Had it been a modern compilation such contradictions would have been stud iously avoided. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 4 It is probable that many earnest Masons may not agree with all Brother Ward \u0000 s interpretations. Nor can such unanimity reasonably be e xpected. Freemasonry, as a gradual accretion of the Wisdom of Ages Imm emorial, bears traces of many succes sive schools of thought. But all i ts messages are fraught with h ope for the regeneration of humanity. The author intimated his desire in this s eries of handbooks to lead others to prosecute the study of Masonry for themselves; and indeed he has abundantly proved that in its unfathomable depths there are many g ems of priceless ray serene which will well repay the search. Brother Ward is heartily to be congratulated on h aving attained the object he had in view. John A. Cockburn. CHAPTER I QUESTIONS AND P.W . Those of our Brethren who have read the previous two books of this s eries will not need much h elp in understanding the significance of the questions which are put to the Candidate. before being raised. Practically every question h as been dealt with in d etail i n the previous books; the majority of them are taken from incidents in the Lectures and Tracing Board, and since the latter was explained at some length we shall not now detain our readers long. The mann er of preparation for the second d egree stre ssed the masculine side, which is c haracteristic of it. The admission on a S. indicated that t he Candidate. had p rofited b y the moral training received in the First degree, and that his c onduct had always been on the S.. There is, however a deep esoteric m eaning in the apparent platitude that it is the fourth part of a circle. Among all the ancient nations the circle is a symbol of God the Infinite, Whose name we discovered in the second d egree in the M.Ch., where we leamt t hat it consisted of four letters. Thus the Candidate. was admitted on one letter of the Mystic Name, and if the four Sq.s are united with the circle in a peculiar way they form the cosmic c ross, emblem of matter, within the circle of the Infinite. We have in the last book considered at s uch length what is implied b y the words \"Hidden mysteries of nature and science,\" that we need here only refer our readers to that section, wherein we saw that in form er times these hidden mysteries undoubtedly referred to certain occult powers, which woul d b e dangerous if acquired b y a man who had not proved himself to be of the highest moral character. The \"wages\" we receive consist of the power to comprehend the nature of God, Who resides in the M.Ch. of the Soul of every Mason. The F.C. receives his wa ges without scruple or diffidence because the Spiritual benefit he receives from Freemasonry is in exact proportion to his desire, and ability, to comprehend its inn er m eaning. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 5 He cann ot receive e ither m ore or less than h e has earned, for if he has not un derstood the profound lesson of the Divinity within h im, naturally he cann ot benefit there from. His employers are the Divine Trinity, of Whom Justice is one of the outstanding attributes. God could not be unjust and remain God. This c onception is almost a platitude, but the average man, while realizing that God will not withh old any reward earned, is at t imes apt t o assume that because God is love He will reward us more than we deserve. This is c learly a mistake, for God could not be partial without ceasi ng to be God, therefore the F.C. receives exactly the Spiritual wages he has earned, and neither m ore nor less, but some F.C. \u0000 s will nevertheless obtain a greater reward than others, because spiritually they have earned it. The significance of the names o f the P....rs was explained in the last book, but in view of the nature of the third d egree it seems advisable to point out once more that their secret Kabalistic meaning is (1) Being fortified b y every moral virtue, (2) you are now properly prepared, (3) to undergo that last and greatest trial which fits you to become a M M .. Thus we see that even the w..ds of the preceding degrees lead up to this, the last and greatest. As in the form er case, the remark of the W.M. that he will put other questions if des ired indicates the possibility of members of the Lodge asking questions based on the Lectures of the Second Degree, or even on the Tracing Board. It is, indeed, a pity that this right is practically never exercised. For example, a particularly appropriate question would b e \"What was the name of the man who cast the two great p....rs ? \" As it is, the Candidate. in a dramatic way represents the closing incidents in the life of this great man, whose importance till then h e has hardly had any opportunity of re alizing. Having answered these test questions, the candidate. is again entrusted with a P.W., etc., to enable him to enter the Lodge after it has been raised to the Third degree during this temporary absence. We have in the previous book explained that th e raising of a Lodge should alter the vibrations of those present by a process well recognized in the ceremonies of Magic, and, to enable the Candidate. quickly to become in time with these higher spiritual vibrations, a word of \"power\" is given h im, which in a moment places him on the same plane as the other m embers of the Lodge. This word he has to give, not only outside the d....r of the Lodge, but also imm ediately before his presentation by the S.W. as \"Properly prepared to be raised to the Third Degree .\" It is only after this has been done that t he real ceremony of the Third Degree, so far as the c. is concerned, begins, and therefore that t he full force of the vibrations of the M.M. \u0000 s c ome into play. The P.W. itself is of the greatest significance, mo re e specially when combined with the P.W. leading from the First t o the Second d egree. At one time the P.W. \u0000 s were reversed. T.C. being the W. leading to the Second, and Sh ... . the W. leading to the Third. This is s till the case in those foreign Grand Lod ges, such as the Dutch and the French, which derive from us before 1740 , when the W.s were altered owing to certain un - authorized revelations. This alteration was one"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 6 of the just grievances which brought about t he secession of the so - called \"Ancients,\" who charged Grand Lodge with altering the Ancient Landmarks. When the Irish followed our example they continued the prohibition of the introduction of m..ls until the Third d egree, which is a logical procedure, for clearly y ou have no right t o bring them into Lodge until you have been symbolically introduced to the first artificer in that material. As the W.s now stand they convey the following spiritual lesson: - the F.C. is one who finds the simple necessities of life, such as C. and W., sufficient for his re quirements. They are plenty to the spiritually minded man, whose soul becomes c logged and hampered b y the acquisition of worldly possessions and since it is hard for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, imm odesty the Candidate. has symbolically recei ved W.P. he is Sl....n. T.C. conveys the lesson that W.P. in themselves bring death to the soul and prevent its upward p rogress. To - day, the river of death conn ected with the P.W. leading to the Second d egree has largely lost its s ignificance, whereas whe n it was a P.W. leading to the Third, it was in itself a fine allegory. We must remember that Bunyan \u0000 s Pilgrim \u0000 s Progress was well known and widely read at t he beginn ing of the 18th Century, and those who were re - organizing our rituals at that time could not have been blind to the similarity of the allegory hidden in the w. Sh . and the account by Bunyan of Christian \u0000 s fording the river of death on the way to the Holy City. The change of about 1740 d estroyed this allegory, and its s urvival in the Tracing Bo ard is now merely one of those numerous footnotes which, to the careful student, are invaluable indications of the various transform ations though which our r itual has passed d uring the course of years. Nevertheless, I do not regret the change, as I think t he present spiritual lesson is even finer than the form er one, but the other arrangement was more logical. Firstly, from the practical point of view the F.C. required the use of m..1 tools to perform his operative tasks, and in the process of his work acqu ired W.P., in contradiction to the E.A., who did only rough work and received only maintenance: i.e., corn, wine , and oil. Secondly, from the symbolical standpoint t he sequence was also more logical, for the F.C., having acquired wealth by means of his s k ill, was brought to the river of d., and p assed through it in the Third Degree. According to Bro. Sanderson, in h is \"Examination of the Masonic Ritual,\" the actual translation of the Hebrew w . Sh . is an \" e. of c., or a f. of w.\" - hence the mann er in whic h it is depicted in a F.C. \u0000 s Lodge - while the w. T.C. in Hebrew means only a blacksmith, though another w. similarly pronounced means acquisition. Hence, as he points out, \" an allegorical title has, in translating the Old Testament, been mistaken for the n ame of an actual person, for the name itself means `A worker in M...t...ls \u0000 \" Therefore the conn ection with H.A.B. is obvious. Bro. Sanderson, quoting from the \"Secret Discipline,\" by S. L. Knapp, says, \"In a work on ancient ecclesiastical history the follo wing occurs, \u0000 By a singular plasus linguae the moderns have substituted T.C. in the Third Degree for tymboxein - to be e ntombed. \u0000 \" While I am unable to say whether Knapp is justified in this s tatement, it is quite probable that this P.W., and indeed all the P.W.’s are comparatively modern substitutes, taken from the Bible to replace ancient W.s of power whose full meaning was lost and whose form in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 7 consequence had b ecome corrupt and unintelligible. The Greek word tymboxein would b e peculiarity suitable for a P.W. leading to the Third Degree, in view of its meaning, and mediaeval magical ceremonies are full of corrupt Greek words indiscriminately mingled with equally corrupt Hebrew and Arabic. There is, therefore, nothing intrinsically improbable in the sugges tion that this ancient Greek word was the original from which T.C. has been evolved. We know as a fact that large pieces of Biblical history were imported wholesale into our r ituals in the 18th Century, and what is more likely than that an unintelligible w ork, already so corrupt as not even to be recognizable as Greek, should b e amended into a well known Biblical character? However, the word as it stands, because of its Hebrew meaning of acquisition, can correctly be translated as W.P., while as meaning an artificer in M. it clearly refers to H.A.B., who made the two p..... rs, and whom the Candidate. is to represent. Thus, following this line of interpretation, we perceive that t he Candidate. really represents H.A.B. when h e e nters the Lodge, although under the disguised title conveyed b y the P.W.. In dealing with these P.W.’s I have e ndeavored to show that there are meanings within meanings, and the same is true of practically every important incident in the whole ceremony. In a book of this s ize it is obvi ously impossible to attempt to give all of these meanings, and even if one did the result would b e to befog the young reader and so prevent him from getting a clear and conn ected interpretation of the ceremony. It is for this reason that, in the main, I am concentrating on one line of interpretation, but I have thought it desirable in this s ection to give a hint to more advanced students, so that they can follow up similar lines of investigation for themselves. PREPARATION In English and Scotch workings t here is no c.t. around the Candidate. in preparation for the Third Degree, but in the Irish working it is wound once around his n., in the Second d egree twice, and the First t hree times. If we regard the c.t. as s ymbolizing those things which h amper a man \u0000 s s piritual progress, the gradual unwinding of it as used in Irish workings becomes of great significance. This interpretation implies that the Candidate. is hampered in Body, Soul and Spirit in the First Degree, whereas by the time he has reached this poi nt in the Third Degree the Body and Soul have triumphed over the sins which peculiarly assail them, and in that stage symbolized b y the Degree itself the Spirit has only to triumph over Spiritual sins, such as Spiritual Pride. With this exception the mann e r of preparation is the same in all these British workings, and indicates that the Candidate. is now about to consecrate both sides of his nature, active and p assive, creative and preservative, etc., to the service of the Most High. The e xplanation alread y g iven in the previous books of the various details, such as being s.s., holds here, and a brief glance at the other volumes will render it unn ecessary for m e to take up valuable space therewith in this third b ook. The Can. is then brought to the Lodge do or and gives the Kn.s of a F.C. These Kn \u0000 s indicate that Soul and Body are in union, but the Spirit is s till out of contact"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 8 whereas the proper Kn \u0000 s of a M.M. (2/1) indicates that the Spirit dominates the Soul and is in union with it, the body having fallen away into significance. It will be remembered that in the first book of this s eries I pointed out that the three separate kn \u0000 s of an E.A. symbolize that in the uninitiated man, Body, Soul and Spirit are all at variance. Meanwhile the Lodge has been raised to a Third Degree by a ceremony whose profound significance demands consideration in a separate chapter. CHAPTER II THE OPENING Having satisfied himself that all present are symbolically upright and moral men, the W.M. asks the J.W. if his s piritual na ture has evolved sufficiently to control both soul and b ody. The J.W. suggests that he should b e tested, not only by the e mblem of upright conduct, but also by the Compasses. Now these combined with the Square form a lozenge, which is itself a symbol for t he Vesica Piscis, emblem of the female principle. The Compasses, moreover, are the instruments with which geometrical figures are created, and more especially the Circle. By means of two circles the triangle, emblem of the triune nature of God,. is produce d, while the Cirde itself is the e mblem of Eternity and therefore of Spirit. A point within the circle form s the symbol for the Hindu conception of the Supreme Being, Paramatma, whence we have come and whither we shall all ultimately return. At t he center of the circle rests all knowledge; there shall we find every lost secret. Now such a figure can only be drawn with the help of the Compasses, and in drawing it t he following significant symbolical act takes place. One point of the Compass rests at the cen ter, and the other m akes the circle of the Infinite. No matter how far the legs of the Compass be e xtended, or how large the Circle, the fact remains that one leg is always at the center. Thus the Compasses, while they travel through infinity, are at t he s ame time never separated from the center, and from that point cann ot err. This instrument may therefore be considered as s tanding for the Divine Spark in Man, in all i ts manifestations. One of these is c onscience; but the Divine Spark has many attributes and names. So the J.W. \u0000 s reply indicates that he is prepared to be tested b oth by the moral code and b y the spiritual laws of our being. But after these preliminaries the proceedings become of an even more e xalted nature. All that has gone before has bee n but preparation for the Great Quest on which we must now set forth. It is the quest of the Soul for r ealization of God, and at - one - ment with Him. This is the Mystic Quest of all ages, and, true to the ancient symbolism, it starts from the East, the place of Light, and goes towards the West, the place of darkness and d eath. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 9 The East represents God, Who is our home. It indicates that each soul comes out from the place of Light, from Light itself, that is, from the very substance of God, descends through th e Gateway of the Dawn and b ecomes incarnate in Matter. But it brings with it a sense of loss and separation, for it has c ome out from God, and the Divine Spark within it longs return whence it came. Having lost the secret of its true nature and the way of return, it wanders in darkness, seeking and for m ost men the way of return is through the Western portal, the gateway of Death, for so long as we are finite beings we cann ot hope to comprehend the Infinite. Yet there are some few exceptions to the general rule, who, while still i n the flesh, have a vision of the Divine splendor, are caught up in it, and b ecame one with God. To such men the return to o rdinary mundane e xistence seems unreal and shadowy. Where others believe in God they Know Him, but it is al most impossible for them to convey to o thers the e xperience through which they have gone. Yet that such experiences are real, as real as any other fact in life, is attested b y a long line of witnesses right throughout the ages. To the average man, however , the first real step towards the realization of what constitutes God is through the portal of physical death; - but even then the e nd is s till far off. Hence the answer explaining how the true secrets c ame to be lost indicates, not the cause of the loss, but the first step towards the recovery, and this fact is borne out by the subsequent events in the ceremony itself. Note, it is the body only that dies, and b y its death enables the Soul and Spirit to re - discover in part the secrets which were last. Yet this death of the Body effectually debars the comm unication of these secrets to the sorrowing F.C. \u0000 s left behind. It is the passing through that veil which separates life and d eath which stars us on the road which ends with God. It must never be forgotte n, however, that t he genuine secrets are never recovered in the Craft, although symbolically we rise from the grave, for that secret can only be discovered at or with the C. - i.e., with God. To that exalted position we can only attain after long journeys th rough the planes of existence beyond the grave. In our symbolism there is nothing which indicates that imm ediately after death man is fit t o pass into the presence of the King of Kings. But the Divine Spark within us is never r eally separated from the Gre at and All - Pervading Spirit. It is s till part of it, though its glory is dimm ed b y the veil of flesh. Therefore, just as one arm of the compasses ever rests on the center, no matter how far the other leg travels; so however far we may travel from God, and however long and hard may be the journey, the Divine Spark within us c an never be truly separated from Him, or err from that Center. Thus the point of the Compasses at the center of the circle may be considered to be the Spirit, the head of the Compasses t he Soul, and the point on the circumference the body. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 10 So the task is s et and the brethren go forth on the quest, that quest which must lead through the darkness of death, as the ceremony that follows tells in allegory. It is not correct t o say that t he se arch h inted at in the Opening ceremony is s uddenly abandoned, and those who think this misinterpret the whole meaning of the legend. Never in earthly life shall we find the answer we seek, nay, even death itself will not give it; but, having passed b eyond the grave, through the four veils of the Scottish rite, and so into the H.R.A., we find an excellent answer in allegorical and symbolical language, whilst the jewel of the degree e mphasizes what the e nd of the quest is. Nor m ust it be forgotten that the b ody alone cann ot realize the nature of God, and that is why without the help of the other two, H.A.B. neither could, nor would, disclose the S........ t. The W.M. \u0000 s promise to help indicates that the Spirit will render assistance, but though the Spirit sub sequently raises man from the grave it is not sufficiently evolved to give him the true secret. This c an only come about when the Spirit has raised the Soul to a far higher stage of spirituality. Though this is the degree of Destruction, that form of the Trinity is not invoked, and the title used corresponds more closely to the Hindu name for the All - Embracing than to their form of the Destroyer. This no doubt is deliberate, for the symbol of this degree is the same e mblem which among the Hindus denotes th e Most High, namely the Circle with a Point within it. In some Scotch rituals, after the Lodge has been opened in the first degree the I.P.M., or the D.C., opens the V.S.L., and, strange to say, does s o with the words, \"In the beginn ing was the Word.\" Sim ilarly, when the Lodge is c losed in the first degree the book is c losed with the words, \"And the word was with God.\" Here then we get two striking features: 1) the use of words from the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John , and 2 ) their correl ation with the phrase in the Third Degree, \"At, or with the C.\" This procedure suggests that the lost W. is the Logos, or Christ, and remembering what we have previously pointed out in the e arlier books, i.e., that there is a perfectly logical Christian in terpretation of the whole of the Craft ceremonies, this fact becomes of increasing significance. Before closing this c hapter, I would like to add that the Third Degree lends itself to a Christian interpretation even more markedly than the form er ones, and several of the higher degrees in Freemasonry adopt and expand this line of teaching. In view of the fact t hat in the Middle Ages Freemasonry was undoubtedly Christian, we cann ot lightly reject t his v iew of the inn er m eaning of the ceremonies, but as the frame work of our ceremonies apparently g oes back before Christian times, a non - Christian interpretation is equally perm issible. CHAPTER III"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 11 THE SYMBOLICAL J OURNEYS, ETC. The Can. is admitted on h e C....... s, and this fact is of far greater significance than most brethren probably realize. Firstly, as has been n oted, one arm of the C.s is always at the C., no matter how far the other m ay travel, and from the point of view of the Can., though h e knows it not, this act in a sense indicates that his heart, and therefore he himself, is at or on the C........ e. Secondly, the C....s in this degree link up with the Sq. used in the form er degree on a similar occasion. We have seen in the previous books that the Sq. and C........ s are united on the Ped. in such a way as to form the Vesica Piscis, the e mblem of the female principle, and the symbol of birth and rebirth. Hence symbolically the Candidate passes through the Vesica Piscis. Also after entering the Lodge in this, as in the previous degrees, he kn....s whil e the blessing of Heaven is invoked, and as he does s o the wands of the deacons are crossed above his head. He thus kn........ s in a triangle, the e mblem of Spirit, and itself conn ected with the lozenge. Two equilateral triangles make a lozenge, which is p roduced from the Vesica form ed - form ed b y two circles, as s hown by the first proposition in Euclid. In view of the great stress laid upon Geometry throughout the whole of our r ituals these facts c ann ot be ignored. Our Operative Brn. must have realized that the whole science of Geometry arises out of this first proposition, which shows how to make a triangle (the e mblem of the Trinity and the Spirit) by means of two circles whose circumferences pass through the center of each other. In doing so they form the Vesica form ed, which gives birth first of all to the triangle, and secondly, to the double triangle, in the form of a lozenge. This last emblem is s ymbolized b y the sq., denoting matter, and the c...s, denoting spirit. The above facts throw a flood of ligh t upon the interplay between these Masonic emblems. Before leaving this s ubject it is worth while pointing out that the Can. likewise takes every Ob. in Craft masonry within this triangle, and that t he same method is employed in other ancient rites, inclu ding those of the Society of Heaven and Earth in China, where the Can. kn...s on one sword, while two others are held over his head so as to form a triangle of steel. The Can. now starts on h is three symbolical journeys. He first satisfies the J.W., repre senting the Body, that he is an E.A., i.e., a man of good moral character. He next satisfies the S.W., representing the Soul, that he has benefited b y the lessons of life and acquired intellectual knowledge. Then comes the third journey, when h e is once mo re challenged b y the Soul, who demands the P.W., the full significance of which h as already been explained. Let us c ombine these meanings! H e comes laden with worldly possessions, which in themselves c arry the seeds of death, unconsciously representing in his person the worker in metals who made the twin columns, and is about to be e ntombed. (tymboxein). Therefore the Soul presents him to the Spirit as one properly prepared to carry out the part of his great predecessor. There is a point here which we need to realize, for it is one which is often overlooked. In the previous degrees only one Deacon was instructed to lead the Can. by the proper S...ps to the E., but here both are needed. From the practical point of view there is no o bvious reason"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 12 why the help of the J.D. should b e invoked at all, and as the ceremony is usually carried out he does nothing but look on. I believe, however, the S.D. should first go through the S...ps and the J.D., should assist the Can. to copy his example. If thus were so we shou ld get an almost exact repetition of the analogous c eremony in the R.A. where the p.s., corresponding to the S.D., is helped b y an assistant. Thus, with the Can., in both cases we get a Trinity, only one of whom actually descends into the g., or, in the ot her case, into the v. As Major Sanderson h as pointed out in An Examination of the Masonic Ritual, among the primitive, races usually, a man who stepped over an o.g. would b e considered to have comm itted sacrilege, and almost certainly would b e slain, but, on the other hand, we do know that in many Initiatory Rites either the Can., or someone e lse for him, steps down into a gr., and is s ubsequently symbolically sl...n therein. If this be the true interpretation of this part of the ceremony, the reason for t he presence of the two deacons in addition to the Can. becomes c lear. It is only the Body that descends into the clear the Soul and the Spirit have no part t herein. Thus, f or the moment, though only temporarily, these three represent the triune nature of m an, while the three principal officers represent t he triune nature of God. The fact t hat t his is undoubtedly true in the case of the R.A., makes it almost certain that the same idea underlies this apparently unimportant difference between the arrangements in the third d egree, and those followed in the first and second. Again and again when one comes to study carefully the details of our r itual, one finds little points, such as these, which would certainly not have survived the drastic revision of 1816 if t here had not been present some men who really did understand the inn er m eaning of our ceremonies, and refused to allow important lessons to be lost by the removal of what, at first sight, appear to be unn ecessary details. Therefore, those of us who value the inn er m eaning of our ceremonies owe a deep d ebt of gratitude to these men, even though their actual names be unknown to us, and on our part a duty is imposed on us that we shall not hastily tamper with the rituals, merely because we do not ourselves s ee the full significance of a phrase or think that by revising it we can make the wording run more smoothly. The next factor we must consider m ost careful is the actual sp...s themselves. These make the Latin cross of suffering and sacrifice. Sometimes t he sp..s are not done quite correctly, for the Can. should b e careful to face due North, due South, and d ue East respectively. This procedure undoubtedly refers to the three e ntrances of the Temple through which H.A.B. endeavored to escape. Hence it is we see that the Master himself trod out the cross of Calvary during the tragedy, and in a sense made the Consecration Cross of the Temple. In a mediaeval church, and even to - day at t he consecration of a church according to the Anglican ordinance, there shoul d b e a dedication cross marked on the building. In the Middle Ages these were usually marked on the pillars, and apparently corresponded to the mark made by an illiterate person"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 13 when witnessing a deed. The Consecrating Bishop sometimes drew this c ross on t he pillar or wall, or sometimes merely traced over a cross already painted there for the purpose. Any new piece of work in a church, even if only a new fresco, had its dedication cross. For example : - At Chaldon Church, Surrey, the dedication cross is marke d on the margin of a fresco depicting The Brig of Dread, described at length in Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods. Bearing these facts in mind, we shall perceive that, even from the Operative point of view, the mann er of advancing in this degree, and the m ann er in which H.A.B. met his end, had a peculiar significance. The Great Architect of the Temple must have traced the dedication cross the whole length and b readth of the Temple in h is own blood. Moreover, such dedication crosses as have actually survived are nearly always found to be painted in red. Thus, H.A.B. \u0000 s last work was, as it were, to comm ence the consecration of the Temple which was c ompleted b y K.S., f or until that cross had b een marked either on the wail or pavement, according to mediaeval O pe rative ideas the building could not be consecrated. Therefore, the Can., who is reenacting the same drama, must obviously do likewise, and in so doing dedicates the Temple of his body. But there is s till more hidden within this c eremonial act. The ancient Knights Templar were accused of trampling on the cr., and a careful examination of the evidence taken at t he trial shows that in reality they took a ritual sp., somewhat similar to those taken by the Can. in this degree. One of the e soteric meanings indi cated is the Way of the Cross which leads to Calvary. Furtherm ore, having thus traced out a cr. he is s ubsequently laid on it, and this fact is emphasized b y the position in which h is legs or feet are placed. The foot of this c r. reaches to the Ped., on wh ich rests the O.T. If, therefore, this s ymbolical cr. were raised as it was on Calvary it would rest on the O.T., and the Can. would face the E., and would b e, as it were, on a mountain. This fact should b e borne in mind b y those who seek a Christian inter pretation of our Craft ceremonies. Mystically interpreted, it indicates that every aspirant for union with the Divine must tread the Way of the Cross, and suffer and d ie thereon, in order that he may rise to a new life, a realization of his union with the Infinite. Even those who are disinclined to admit t he possibility of a Christian interpretation, of the Craft degrees, must recognize the fact that this c r. is the cr. of sacrifice and means that the true aspirant must be prepared to sacrifice everything in h is s earch after Truth. The number of the sp...s is the combination of the Trinity and of the four elements, representing matter. It is the same number as form s the perfect lodge, and also the seven elements which form m an, whether we interpret it acco rding to the ancient Egyptian system, or in the more modern form of the five physical senses, the Soul and the Spirit. In the latter case it indicates that the man must be prepared to sacrifice, or shall we say dedicate to God, Body, Soul and Spirit. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 14 Ther e are yet other profound meanings in this one ritual act, but enough h as been written to set my readers pondering for themselves, and we will therefore proceed to consider the next point in the ceremony. The Ob. itself contains one or two interesting poin ts. Thus it indicates that a M.M. \u0000 s Lodge must always be open on the C.. This s hows us at once that we are dealing with a ceremony with a mystical meaning, for the C. means the same as the middle ch. in the second d egree - the secret chamber of the heart, wh ere dwells the Divine Spark - and so tells us in veiled language that all that happens thereafter is a spiritual experience, which sooner or later comes to every mystic. The special moral obligations which the Can. undertakes s hould b e noted, but require no explanation. It is, however, difficult to understand why they should b e deferred until this s tage. In the ancient charges s imilar obligations are imposed apparently on the E.A., and this s eems more logical. The Py. varies even in different parts of Englan d, but in essentials is always the same. You are s. at the c., and the mann er of disposal is v ery reminiscent of the way in which the dead are cremated in India in h onor of Sh iva. There the corpse is burnt near runn ing water, preferably near the Ganges, an d the ashes are thrown into the air over the river to the four cardinal points, that the winds may scatter them. It must be remembered that Sh iva represents the destructive attribute of the Deity and he makes the P.S. of a M.M. on h is s tatues. His is the e lement of fire, and all these facts must be born in mind when considering our own Py. The position of the Sq. and Cs., in addition to the e xplanation given, indicates that the spirit, represented b y the Cs., now dominates the body, typified b y the Sq.. CHAPTER IV THE E XHORTATION The opening part of the e xhortation gives a convenient summ ary of the previous digress and quite clearly indicates that the first inn er m eaning of the series is Birth, Life which is of course e ducational and p reparatory for it s sequel, and Death. The phrase relating to the second d egree \"And to trace it, from its development through the paths of Heavenly Science e ven to the throne of God Himself,\" shows plainly its real significance. As pointed out in the F.C. Handbook, in the Mid. Ch. the F.C. discovers not only the name of God, but that he himself is the fifth letter Sh in which transform s the name Jehovah into the name Jeheshue, or Messias, the King. But according to the old Kabala Jeheshue must be raised on the cross of Tiph areth, and the significance of this fact is impressed on our Can. by the incidents now to take place. The average Christian n eed not trouble about the subtleties of the Kabala, for the story in the New Testament supplies him with a very similar interpretat ion."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 15 The W.M. having, almost casually, given h im this key to the inn er m eaning of what is about t o follow, proceeds at once to the most dramatic part of the ceremony. Up to this point almost all form s of our r itual are practically the same, but henceforwa rd there are many marked d ifferences. \"Emulation\" ritual may be regarded as c ontaining the bare minimum, but the additional details found in many Provincial workings in England, and in S cotland, Ireland, America, and many of the Continental Lodges, are too important to be ignored. There is no reason to assume that they are inn ovations; on the contrary all the evidence points to the fact that they are integral parts of the ceremony which, for various reasons, were omitted b y the revisers of our r itual who me t in the Lodge of Reconciliation. I shall therefore proceed to note and explain them where necessary. Whereas in Emulation working as s oon as the Ws. are called on the deacons retire, in most others, in the Provinces, etc., they fall back to the head of t he g.. Thus with the W.M. the W.s form the triangle of Spirit, and with the D.s the Sq. of matter, on which the triangle rests, for the M. descends from his c hair and stands in front of the Ped.. As a practical piece of advice I would recomm end that the J. W. should not direct the Can. to c. his f. until after the S.W. has dealt with h im, for it is impossible for him to drop on h is respective k...s if his f. are c., whereas by carrying out these instructions before the last attack he will fall the more readi ly. In most of the old Scotch rituals the Can. journeys round the Lodge, is attacked b y the J.W. in the S., by the S.W. in the W. (note that), and returns to the M. in the E., where the final incident takes place. I think, however, our English system of h aving the attack in the N. instead of in the W. is preferable, and is probably the correct form . In the Scotch ritual the three villains have names, and the same is the case in America. They are Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum. The word itself clearly comes fr om the Latin word meaning \"To comm and,\" and refers to the fact t hat t hey comm anded him to give up the S....s. But t he term inations of the three names appear to have a curious esoteric reference to India. It can h ardly be by accident that these three names form the mystic word AUM. The U in India in this c ase is pronounced almost like O, and when this word is disguised, as it usually is, it is written OMN. If this be so we have the Creative Preservative, and Ann ihilative aspects of the Deity emphasized in th e Third Degree, and it is the Destructive aspect, symbolized b y the letter M, which deals the final stroke. This v ariation is therefore of importance, but I must warn my readers that not all Scotch workings have it, some of them being much more akin to o u r own, even h aving the attack in the N.. Practically all of them, however, have the perambulations, during which solemn music is played. The usual procedure is for the brethren to pass round the gr. once making the P. S. of an E.A.. When this is done the J .W. makes his abortive attempt. The second round is made with the H. S. of an F.C., after which the S.W. tries and fails. The third round is made with the S. of G. and D. of a M.M., on the conclusion of which the Can. is r... by the lion \u0000 s g.... It is a great pity that the use of this name for the M. M. \u0000 s"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 16 g. is falling into disuse in London, for it has in itself important symbolical references, to which we shall refer later in the chapter. In many parts of England it is s till customary to place the Can., either in a c ---- n or in a g. made in the floor, and the same method is found in most other parts of take world. Indeed, in the Dutch ritual the Can. is first of all shown a c..n in which is a human skeleton. This is s ubsequently removed, though h e does n ot know it and he thinks when h e is laid therein h e will find himself in its bony clutches. Even as near London as Windsor there is a Masonic Temple which h as a special chamber of d. with a g. actually in the floor and until recently it was s till used alth ough whether it is to - day I cann ot say. Let us now turn to consider the meanings of the main incidents. The first meaning of the degree is obvious; it prepares a man for his final end and hints of a possibility of life beyond the grave but it must be admi tted that the lesson is not driven h ome with the same force as it is in most of the ancient mysteries. Osiris Himself rose from the dead and b ecame the Judge of all who followed after Him, and b ecause of this fact His worshippers believed that t hey too wou ld rise. In our legend, however, it is only the dead b ody of H.A.B. which is lifted out of the g. in a peculiar m ann er, and in the legend there is not even a hint as to what befell his Soul. The question is often asked why they should have raised a c..s an d p laced it on its feet. (1) (1) See Ward, Who Was Hiram Abiff? One e xplanation probably is, by analogy with the Greek story of the mann er in which Hercules recovered Alcestis and ransomed her from the bondage of Thanatos - Death h imself. We are told that Hercules wrestled with Thanatos and would nor let him go until he had agreed to allow Hercules to bring her back from the realm of the Sh ades to the land of living men. It may be that the corpse here represents Death. It is also worth n oting that Isis join ed together the fragments of the body of Osiris, and the \"Setting up\" of the backbone of the God was a ceremony carried out every y ear by the ancient Egyptian Priests. The body of Osiris apparently was raised from the bier by Anubis in precisely the same w ay as the M.M. is r.. When it was s et on its feet life returned to it. One fact is c ertain, that in every Rite which h as as its c entral theme symbolic d. the Can. is r. by the same g., and in precisely the same mann er, and this mann er becomes a method of g reeting and of recognition among all who have passed through this type of ceremony. For example : - it is known and used in the Dervish Rite, among West African Negroes, among the Red Indians of Central America, and was apparently known to the ancient Druids , for it is carved on a stone found at Iona. In the ancient rites of Mithra it also appears to have been the method used upon a similar occasion. These facts s how that it is an ancient landmark and one to be most carefully g uarded. The use of the phrase T he Lion Grip is peculiarly significant, as Major Sanderson shows in h is work, An Examination of the Masonic Ritual. Therein he points out that in the Book of the Dead the Supreme God, whether Ra or Osiris, is appealed to as the \" God in the Lion form ,\" and in all such cases the prayer of the Soul is that he may be perm itted to \" Come forth \" in the East,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 17 rising with the sun from the d..s of the g.. In Egypt t he lion was the `personification of strength and p ower, but it is usually associated with the idea o f the regeneration of the Sun, and therefore with the resurrection. Major Anderson goes on to point out as follows. \"Sh u (Anh eru, `the Lifter \u0000 ) who as the light of the Dawn was s aid to lift up the sky - goddess from the arm s of the sleeping Earth, is often r epresented as a lion, for only through h im was the rebirth of the Sun made possible. Osiris is c alled the lion of yesterday, and Ra the Lion of tomorrow : the bier of Osiris is always represented as having the head and legs of a lion.\" Thus as Major Sander son indicates, the e xpression \"the lion grip\" is a survival from, the Solar cult, and therefore a landmark which should b e carefully preserved. The Bright Morning Star whose rising brings peace and Salvation, almost certainly was originally Sirius, but to Englishmen it must seem strange that Sirius s hould b e said to bring peace and Salvation. The association of these ideas with the Dog Star is undoubtedly a fragment which h as c ome down from Ancient Egypt, for the rising of Sirius marked the beginn ing of th e inundation of the Nite, which literally brought salvation to the people of Egypt by irrigating the land and enabling it t o produce food. That Sirius was an object of veneration to the philosophers of the ancient world is well known to all archaeologists, and many of the Temples in Egypt have been proved to have been oriented on S irius. There is also a good d eal of evidence showing that some of the stone circles in Great Britain were similarly oriented on S irius by the Druids. It is therefore not surprisin g that this s tar is s till remembered in our rituals. Naturally it has acquired a deeper spiritual meaning in the course of years, and may be regarded as representing the First Fruits of the Resurrection, the sure hope of our Redemption. This aspect is s et forth in the lectures drawn up b y Dunckerley, who regarded it as the star of Bethlehem, and as typifying Christ. See Rev. xxii, 16. At t his point t he Can.. who has been carefully put in the N., the place of darkness, is moved round b y the right to the Sou th. From the practical point of view this is to enable the M. to re - enter his c hair from the proper side, but there is also an inn er m eaning. Imm ediately after death the Soul is s aid to find itself on the e arth plane amid murk and d arkness. Lacking mortal eyes, it cann ot perceive the sun, and, on the other hand, is s till so imm ersed in matter that it cann ot yet see clearly with its s pirit eyes; but this s tage rapidly passes away, and the Soul is received into a higher plane of existence, being brought thith er by messengers of Light. The position in the North represents this period of darkness on the e arth plane, and that this is not accidental is s hown by the fact that in most rituals the lights are not turned up until the phrase \"That bright morning star, e tc.\" has been uttered. Then the M., representing one of these spirit messengers, leads the Can. gently round to the South, thereby symbolizing his entry into the place of light. And who is this messenger? Every installed master who has received the P.W. le ading to the Chair should realize that, no matter how unworthy, he represents the risen Christ. Thus we see the peculiarly appropriate nature of the act coming after the reference to the bright morning star, which also in another sense represents the risen Christ. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 18 CHAPTER V THE S.... TS Having thus been brought into the place of light the Can. is given n ot the Gen. Ss, but only substituted ones. This fact must often h ave puzzled the Can.. The practical reason given in the ritual, though perfectly intelli gible to a R.A. mason, cann ot be the real one. In view of the unexpected calamity no - one could have thought K.S. was breaking his ob. by nominating a successor to H.A.B. and giving him the full ss..ts. Actually according to the R.A. story he did something much worse, for he wrote them down and p laced them somewhere, in the hopes that t hey would b e subsequently rediscovered, and he had no assurance that their discoverers would even be masons, much less that they would k eep their discovery secret. Of course t his is also an allegory, and from this s tand - point perfectly correct. The lost s...ts are the nature and attributes of God, which must be realized b y each man for himself, and no o ther m an can really comm unicate them. Moreover, this c omplete realization of the nature of God, and the union of the Divine Spark within us with the Source of All, can never be achieved d uring mortal li fe. Even after death we shall need to leave the world long behind and travel far, before we can h ope to attain that state of spiri tual evolution which will enable us to approach the Holy of Holies, and gaze with unveiled eyes upon Him, Who is the beginn ing and the e nd of all. With regard to these substituted s..ts. let us note that they g row out of those used b y the F.C.. Having alr eady shown in the last book that the sn.s of the F.C., and in fact the real s..t of that degree, is the transform ation of Jehovah into Jeheshue, we see that t his is most appropriate. To use modern language, the second degree teaches of the birth of the Ch rist Spirit within us, while the third indicates that mystically we, like the great Master, must die and rise again. As St. Paul says, \" Die daily in Christ.\" The sn.s given are probably all of great antiquity. Of some we have e vidence which shows that th ey were venerated in ancient Egypt and Mexico, are still employed in the primitive Initiatory Rites of the savages, and are associated with the Gods in India. For example, the P.S. is used b y Sh iva, the Great Destroyer, Who when He makes it, holds in His h and the lariat of death. The sn. of G. and D. is found all round the world, as I have shown in full detail i n Sign Language of the Ancient Mysteries. Ancient Mexico, where Quetzacoatl makes it, can be matched with Easter Island in the far Pacific, Peru, We st Africa, East Africa, New Guinea, Malaya a nd many other places. Major Sanderson points out that the second Cas. Sn . is depicted in Egyptian pictures as being used b y those who are saluting Osiris in h is c offin. Those who desire will find it in Papyrus 9 ,908 in the British Museum. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 19 The English sn. of g. and d . (for up till now w e have been speaking of the Scotch form ) is almost certainly not t he correct one. Its general appearance would incline one to believe that it is a penal sn., though whence derived it is difficult to say. A little thought will i ndicate the nature of the penalty as being somewhat similar to that of one of the higher degrees. So far as I can find it is not recognized as a sn. of g. and d . to - day, except among masons who are descended m asonically from the Grand Lodge of England, but in a picture by Guercino o f Christ cleansing the Temple, in the Palazzo Rosso, Crenoa, both this and the Scotch form are shown, while the G. of H. constantly appears in mediaeval paintings, e.g., in the Raisi ng of Lazarus. (1) The so - called Continental form undoubtedly comes from a well known h igh degree, where it is much more appropriate: it is apparently restricted to the Latin countries, whereas even in Germ any it is the Scotch form that is employed. The sn. of Exul. is a form used to this day in of Asia to indicate worship, and was s imilarly employed in Ancient Egypt. Major Sanderson suggests that it was copied from the position in which Sh u u pheld the sky. Thus we see that six o ut of the so - called seven sn.s c an be shown to be of ancient origin, and it is quite probable that further r esearch will enable us to prove that the other one is equally old. Such sn.s as these originally had a magical significance, and the e xplanation given in the ritual as to th eir (1) see The Sign Language of the Mysteries by Ward. origin is no doubt of a much later date than the sn.s themselves. Indeed, a careful study of certain of the sn.s will show that they are not the natural sn.s which would have been used to indicate the feeling they are said to express. For example, in the sn. of h...r the left hand would not naturally be placed in the position in which we are taught t o put it, if this s n. had originated as related in. the story. So o bvious is this that some modern p receptors of Lodges of Instruction h ave to my knowledge altered the position of the left hand in order to make it conform to the story, but I venture to think that in so doing they are comm itting a very serious mistake, nothing less than the removal of an ancient landmark. Some day we shall probably discover the real origin of this s n., but if it is altered that will of course become impossible. The lion \u0000 s grip and the actual position of r..s...g are e qually old, and, so far as we can find, this mann er o f r..s...g is employed in every rite, whether ancient or primitive, which deals with the dramatic representation of d.. As a mann er of greeting it is employed b y the initiated men in many Red Indian Trihes, in West Africa, among the Senussi in North Africa , and in the Dervish Rites. (1) "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 20 The parts of the b. brought in contact with each other are all parts presided over by some sign of the Zodiac, and there would appear to be some old astrological meaning which h as now become lost. It may possibly have been conn ected with Gemini, the Twins, and this fact is made the more probable by the survival of the name \"The Ln \u0000 s Gr.\" The e xplanation given, although possibly of a fairly recent origin, nevertheless c ontains a valuable inn er meaning, for it shows that we ca nn ot hope to advance towards God unless we do o ur duty to o ur fellow men. Thus in dramatic form is s hown that t he brotherhood of man n ecessitates the Fatherhood of God. It hardly seems necessary in this book to point out again that the regular st. form s a tau cross and teaches us that we must trample under foot our animal passions, if we desire to approach n ear to God. We note, however, that t he Can., in advancing to o btain the s..ts, has perforce to make three tau crosses, and the Christian Mystic will ( 1) For further explanation see Ward, Who Was Hiram Abiff? doubtless perceive in this a hidden reference to the three crosses on Calvary. Finally, as has already been pointed out, the penalties of the first and second degrees draw attention to two importa nt occult centers, and so also in this degree the Solar Plexus, the most important occult center of all, is indicated, and since the object of every Mystic is to achieve the Beatific v ision, the fact that the monks of Mt. Athos, near Salonica, do so by fix ing their eye on this part, shows that there is a very special reason for the special form of the p.s of the third d egree. CHAPTER VI THE BADG E On h is re - entering the Lodge the Can. is presented, and in due course invested by the S.W., as in the previou s degrees, thereby indicating that even after death man \u0000 s s piritual advancement is registered b y the Soul. The Badge itself, however, is full of symbolic meaning, and though in its present form it is of comparatively recent date, it is evident that those w ho designed it had a much deeper knowledge of symbolism than some modern critics are apt to believe. Firstly, the colour, which is that of Cambridge University, and likewise that used b y Parliament when fighting King Charles, has a much deeper significanc e than is generally known. It is c losely related to the colour of the Virgin Mary, which itself had b een brought forward from Isis and the other Mother Goddesses of the ancient world. It is possible that the designers were also influenced b y the e xistence of certain Orders of Knighthood which h ad their appropriate colours, for the aprons of Grand Lodge Officers have Garter blue, but this blue is also the colour of Oxford, and the colour associated with the Royalist cause at the time of the Civil War. At any rate, it is appropriate that our aprons s hould thus employ the colours of the two great Universities of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 21 England. There is, of course, an exception in the case of the red aprons allocated to Grand Stewarts, for which there are historical reasons into which we need not now enter. We may, however point out that the dark b lue aprons of Grand Lodge are often, though erroneously, spoken of as the Purple, indicating a Royal colour, and thereby implying no doubt that Brn. entitled to wear this c olour are rulers in the Craft, and represent the masculine e lement. Light blue, on the other hand, represents the feminine or passive aspect, and is most appropriate for the ordinary M.M., whose duty it is to o bey, and not to comm and. Indeed, the M.M. \u0000 s apron contain: other emblems which indicate this feminine aspect. These are the three rosettes, which symbolize the rose, itself a substitute for the Vesica Piscis, and they are arranged so as to form a triangle with the point upwards, interpenetrating the triangle form ed b y t he flap of the apron. The two triangles only interpenetrate half way, therein differing from the double triangles s een on the jewels worn by R. A. Masons, which completely overlap. These two triangles deserve a little careful study. The lower triangle with its point upwards is the triangle of fire, the e mblem of Sh iva, and the symbol of the Divine Spark. The triangle made by the flap of the apron, which h as its point directed d ownwards, is the triangle of water, and is thus to some e xtent representative of the Soul. These two triangles are within a sq., the e mblem of matter, and therefore of the body, and so we see that the M.M. \u0000 s apron symbolically represents the triune nature of man, whereas the R.A. jewel, (the only high degree jewel which may be worn in a Craft Lodge) has these two triangles within a circle, which is the e mblem of the Infinite. In this case the triangle of water presents the preservative aspect, the triangle of fire, the destructive aspect, the point or eye at the center, the creative asp ect, and the circle, the e verlasting nature of the Supreme Being. There is therefore a curious c orrespondence, and also a marked d ifference, between the jewel of the R.A. Mason, and the apron of the M.M.. Viewed from another standpoint the apron h as anoth er set of meanings. The triangle represents Spirit, and the Sq., matter. The flap form s a triangle entering into the sq., and so depicts the e ntry of Spirit into matter, and therefore, man. The E.A. \u0000 s apron should have the flap p ointing upward, indicating that the Divine Wisdom has not yet truly penetrated the gross matter of our bodies. This c ustom is unfortunately g oing out of use in modern Masonry, which is a great pity, as undoubtedly a valuable lesson is thus lost. The F.C. has the flap p ointing downwa rd for several reasons. Firstly, to indicate that wisdom has begun to enter and therefore to control matter; secondly, to represent the triangle of water and thus indicate that Soul and Body are acting in unison; thirdly, because this triangle is the e mble m of Vishn u the Preserver, and so emphasizes - the fact that the aspect of God taught in this degree is the preservative aspect, whereas the addition of the three rosettes in the third degree shows, not only the union of Body, Soul and Spirit, but also tha t the great lesson of this degree is the importance of the Destructive side of the Deity, or as we may prefer to tall it, the Transform ative side. What, however, of the two rosettes worn by the F.C.? Firstly, they stress the dual nature of man, and have a very clear reference to the two p...rs. Similarly, no doubt, they indicate that the F.C. is not yet a complete and united b eing ; Body and Soul are in union, but unlike the M.M., these two are not in complete"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 22 accord with the Spirit. Thus we obtain a corre spondence between the knocks of the F.C. and the two rosettes. Furtherm ore, the triangle is incomplete, showing that the F.C. is not yet a complete F.M., and this c orrelates with the position of the C.s when taking the ob. in the F. C. degree. Two o ther f eatures of the apron must also be considered. Firstly, the tassels, which appear originally to have been the e nds of the string with which the apron was bound round the waist. There is little doubt that in the 18th century the aprons had not the present sy mbolic tassels, but were fastened round the body in a very similar way to that in which the E.A. and F.C. aprons are to this day. It is interesting to note in this c onn ection that the actual aprons worn by the officers of Grand Lodge for the year, as disti nct from the Past Grand Officers \u0000 aprons, have no tassels at all. In the course of years, no doubt, the e nds of the strings were ornamented b y tassels, and to this day the aprons of the Royal O rder of Scotland are bound round the body by an ornamental cor d with tassels, which are tied in front in such a way that t he two tassels s tick out from underneath the flap. These tassels, when the final form of our aprons was fixed, were separated from the bands which fasten the apron, and attached to the apron itsel f, becoming as we now see simply strips of ribbon on which are fastened seven chains. When this change took p lace it is c lear that those who made the alteration deliberately chose the number 7, and intended thereby to convey a symbolic meaning. We have alr eady explained the numerous s ymbolic meanings of the number 7; for example, it represents God and Man, Spirit and Matter, etc. Naturally they had to have two tassels to balance, and it would have been very inartistic to have had four chains on one tassel and three on the other, and so it would b e unwise to lay too much stress on the number 14, which is the sum total. We may regard it merely as a curious and interesting coincidence that the body of Osiris was s tated to have been divided b y Set into 14 p iece s. But in addition to these details as to the historical development of the tassels, we must not forget that in many of the 18th century aprons the two p....rs are depicted. These aprons were usually decorated b y paintings on the leather, and varied consid erably from Lodge to Lodge, but one of the most usual kinds of decoration included the two p..rs, and the remembrance of these may very probably have influenced those who designed our present apron. The modern arrangement by which the apron is fastened, n amely, a piece of webbing with a hook and eye attachment, gave a fine opportunity for some really profound symbolism, and I feel certain that it was not an accident which led to the universal adoption of the snake to serve this purpose. There are two kind s of symbolism attached to the snake in all ancient religions. Firstly, the snake as the e nemy of man, and therefore as the representative of the powers of evil; and secondly the snake as emblem of the Divine Wisdom. \" Be ye wise as s erpents\" does not refe r to the craftiness of the Devil, but to the Divine Wisdom itself. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 23 In Ancient Egypt t he Soul as he passed through the Underworld met with serpents of evil, and also with serpents of good. In India, legend tells us of a whole order of beings, the Serpent F olk, who are of a Spiritual nature different from m an, possessed their own rulers, and were e ndowed with superhuman wisdom. Some of these are considered to be friendly to man, while others are hostile. The Sacred Cobra is well known to every student of Hin du religions, and is essentially g ood. Actual worship is paid to the Serpent throughout the whole of India, and in many other parts of the world, and in the Kapala we get clear traces of the fact t hat under certain circumstances the serpent is regarded as \"The Sh ining One\" - the Holy Wisdom Itself. Thus we see that the serpent on our apron denotes that we are e ncircled b y the Holy Wisdom. Finally, the serpent biting its tail, and thus form ing a circle, has always been regarded as the e mblem of eternity, and more e specially of the Eternal Wisdom of God. Nor m ust we forget that the snake is peculiarly associated with Sh iva, whose close symbolic association with the third d egree has already been clearly shown. Much more might be written on the meaning of the a pron, but we cann ot devote any more space to this s ubject, interesting though it may be, although before considering our next point it will perhaps be well to recall what has already been mentioned in the E.A. handbook, viz., that aprons, in addition to th eir Operative significance, have right t hrough the ages been employed in conn ection with religious c eremonial. On the monuments of Egypt a garm ent, which can best be described as a triangular apron with the point upward, is depicted in circumstances indica ting that t he wearer is taking part in some kind of ceremony of initiation. In ancient Mexico the Gods are depicted wearing aprons, and it is not without interest to note that the modern Anglican bishop wears an apron, although it appears to have developed from a long flowing robe somewhat the shape of a cassock. CHAPTER VII THE LEGEND After the ceremonial investiture of the Candidate. the W.M. continues the narrative of the traditional history. At least this is the case in most English workings, but in some Scotch workings the whole story is told first, and subsequently the Candidate. and the other Brn. act the chief parts. Perhaps one of the most important points to realize is the correct meaning of the name H.A.B. . Major Sanderson in An Examination o f the Masonic Ritual gives the following interesting interpretations, which we will proceed to expand further. - \" The title H.A.B. is taken direct from the Hebrew of 2 Chron., Chapter 4, verse 16., and means, \u0001 H. His father. \u0000 H. means \u0000\u0003\u0002 xaltation of light, their liberty or whiteness, he that destroys \u0000 ; It is of interest to note that abib in Hebrew means \u0001 Ears of corn, \u0000 or \u0001 Green fruits, \u0000 and there is just a possibility that this is the correct title of H.\" "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 24 Bearing these translations in mind we at once perc eive a whole series of inn er meanings hidden in the name of the principal Architect. Taking the Christian interpretation of our r ituals : - firstly, we shall remember that Christ said \" If I am r aised up (or exalted) I shall draw all men unto me.\" Secondly, Christ died to make us free, that is, to give us liberty from the bonds of death and hell. Thirdly, mediaeval divines were never tired of referring to Christ \u0000 s whiteness and p urity, and relate many beautiful legends and allegories to drive home this lesson . One phrase alone will suffice to bring this aspect of the Christ to o ur minds, i.e. , that He is c onstantly spoken of as \" the lily of the valley.\" Fourthly, He came to destroy the bonds of death and hell, nor m ust we forget the old prophecy spoken conce rning the coming Christ and the serpent, representing Satan, \" It (Christ) shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise His heel,\" Gen. 3. v. 15. It is of interest to note that Quetzacoatl, the Mexican Preserver, who fought and overthrew the great giant of evil, was himself smitten in the foot, near to a fall of water, subsequently died from the wound, and ultimately rose again from the grave. In India Krishn a similarly died from an arrow w ound in the heel. Moreover, in mediaeval frescoes Christ is c onstant ly represented as crushing the head of the great dragon under His left foot, while in His right hand He upraises a staff on which is a cross. Such scenes are usually described as \" The Harrowing of Hell.\" Fifthly, if the word abib is the correct rendering for the second half of the name in question, we get a clear reference to the Sacramental bread. The e ars of corn are obviously synonymous with the wafer or consecrated b read, which in mediaeval days alone was given to the laity: while the alternative tran slation, \"Green Fruits,\" brings to o ur m ind the Biblical saying that Christ is \"the first fruits of them that slept\" (1 Corin, 15. 20). Bearing this possible Christian interpretation in mind, installed masters will perceive the deep significance of the P.W . which leads from the degree of M.M. to that of I.M. But in addition to these Christian interpretations of H.A.B. there was yet another, which in some senses may be regarded as older, and the key to which is s upplied b y India. In this s ense H.A.B. takes on the characteristics of Sh iva, the Destroyer. Firstly, \"Exaltation of life\" reminds us of the legend that Sh iva on a certain day increased in stature until H e overtopped the universe, and, as a result, overthrew Brahma, the Creator, and was acknowledge d b y Vishn u as His superior. On that great day He gathered unto Himself the beginn ing and the end of all things, Alpha a nd Omega, and henceforth birth and d eath alike were in His hands. Secondly, \"Their liberty\" refers to the fact that, to the pious Hindu , Sh iva by death grants liberty from the toil and anguish of this world, and sets the soul free to mount to greater heights of spirituality. Thirdly, Sh iva is always s poken of as the \"Great White God, white with the ashes of the dead who are e ver burned i n His honor.\" Nor m ust we forget that these ashes are always sc attered to the four cardinal points of Heaven."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25 25 Fourthly, He is in His v ery essence \" The Great Destroyer.\" The \"Ears of corn\" are symbols of Vishn u the Preserver, Who Himself, according to nu merous Hindu legends, was s lain and rose from the dead, thereby paying allegiance to the Lord of Death ; and so: Fifthly, we obtain the idea of the Resurrection as s ymbolized b y the e ars of corn, which are planted in the e arth and b ring forth an abundant harvest, the \"Green fruits\" of the fields. In this c onn ection it is as well to remember that the central theme of the Eleusinian Mysteries was the e ar of corn which was s hown to the Candidate. at t he most solemn point of the whole ceremony, and similarly t aught the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead. The next point that strikes us in the legend is the number of craftsmen who \"went in search.\" The Irish version is of peculiar interest, for it relates that it was the twelve who relented who afterward s \"went in search,\" and not a new company of fifteen. In many ways this is more logical, and certainly has a deep symbolic meaning. It is logical in that it shows that the penitent twelve did their best to make amends for ever having allowed themselves to listen to the wicked schemes of the other three, and the subsequent decree of K.S., ordering them to wear white gloves and white aprons as a mark of their inn ocence, is most appropriate. It was a public ann ouncement that K.S. forgave them their indiscretio n and acquitted them of responsibility for the crime. On the other hand, in our version there seems no logical reason why K.S. should order an entirely new batch of F.C. \u0000 s to wear these e mblems of their inn ocence, since they clearly had nothing to do with the crime, and moreover, all the others, except the penitent twelve, were e qually inn ocent, and should therefore likewise have been instructed to wear white gloves and aprons. It must be remembered that t hese white gloves, etc., were not bestowed as a rew ard for having taken part in the search, but are specifically stated to have been ordered to be worn to denote inn ocence. The Irish account goes on to state that the twelve set out from the Temple and went together in one company until they came to a plac e where four roads met, and form ed a cross; then they divided into four companies, and three went North, three East, three South, and three West. Thus they trod the Way of the Cross. In some old Irish workings we are told that the three who went North neve r r eturned. This s ymbolically implies that t hey went into the Place of Darkness. As the tendency in modern Irish masonry appears to be to adjust its ritual in main essentials to o ur English workings, it is but fair that I should say that I have a tangible proof of this form of legend, in the shape of an old Irish apron dated 1790 , which, unlike modern Irish aprons, has a number of paintings on it depicting incidents in the ritual. One of the paintings s hows the twelve F.C. \u0000 s s eparating at the four cross roa ds. (See frontispiece). It is c lear from all accounts, whether English, Irish, Scotch or American, that the scoundrels, the agents of death, were found b y those who went in the direction of Joppa, that is in the W., but we are left in considerable doubt a s to"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 26 whether the b. was found in the E. or in the S.. Symbolically, however, it would clearly be in the S., for H.A.B., like the Christ, was s truck d own at High Twelve, when the sun is in the S.. From a practical point of view it is fairly obvious that the scoundrels who were carrying away the b. could never have reached Joppa if they had once gone E., f or they would have had to fetch h alf a circle round Jerusalem, a procedure which would have rendered their chance of escape almost hopeless. By g oing S. the y might hope to throw their pursuers off the track, and then turn back at an angle, reach Joppa, and escape by boat. That this was their intention is c lear from m any old form s of the legend, and especially in those worked in America. King S., however, f ore saw this possibility and p revented their escape by forbidding any ships to sail. In the American working one of the officers of the Lodge e nacts the part of a sea captain, and even wears a yachtsman’s c ap. The villains c ome to him and b eg him to take them aboard, but he refused b ecause of the e mbargo o rdered b y K.S.. That the same incident was known in the old Irish working is s hown by the little picture on the same Irish apron depicting the arrest of the villains on the sea shore, for in the back ground th ere is a ship. Let us interpret t he meaning of the Irish working first. From the Christian standpoint t he twelve F.C \u0000 s represent t he twelve apostles, Mathias replacing the traitor Judas. But in the non - Christian, and p ossibly earlier interpretation, these twelve would of course be the twelve signs of the Zodiac, searching for the sun which h ad b een eclipsed. We must never forget that in addition to the deep spiritual meaning hidden in our r itual there is also a Solar Myth embedded, which h as in the course of years become allegorized and filled with deeper spiritual truths. But being English masons we must be prepared to find an explanation of the fifteen. In ancient Egyptian times the month consisted of 30 d ays, and the year of twelve such months, plus fiv e e xtra days. Now the first fifteen, of whom twelve recanted, presumably represent the first half of that month, while the second half of the month is represented b y the fifteen who went in search. But spiritually the meaning of the fifteen is fairly clear . Man h as five senses and is triune in n ature, and thus implies that Body, Soul and Spirit must cooperate in trying to find God, and employ on that quest their five senses. Lest there be any misapprehension h ere I would explain that man is c onsidered to h ave not only the five physical senses, but also corresponding senses of Soul and Spirit. The phrase \"To see with the e yes of the Spirit\" is perfectly well known, and similarly we can speak of the e yes of the Soul. To give concrete examples : - Students of ps ychic sc ience constantly speak of clairaudience and clairvoyance. While it is not necessary to accept this type of phenomena, it is clearly obvious that if man survives death at all his Soul must have a means of comm unicating with other Souls and that thes e correspond in some way to o ur physical senses. In like mann er how are we to describe the visions of the great seers and p rophets, related in the Bible, except by the possession of spiritual sight ? Bearing this in mind, we obtain the following interpret ation of the fate which befell the three F.C. Lodges into which the fifteen form ed themselves. Those"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27 27 who found nothing represent the physical senses of man, which are useless beyond the grave : the next company must therefore represent the Soul, for despit e the logic of the physical world, it is the Soul which realizes that death does not end all, and so it was one of these who r...d the M But the power which tells us what is right and wrong, and which ultimately punishes us for our offences, is what we cal l conscience, and thus assuredly is the Divine Spark within us - the Spirit. Let us now turn to consider the details c onn ected with the discovery of the body. The incident of the shrub is s uch a striking analogy with a similar one found in AEneid, wherein A Eneas finds the body of the murdered P olydorus by plucking up a shrub which is near him on the side of a hill, that some students suggest that in the revision of our r itual this incident was c opied from Virgil. But, in Who was Hiram Abiff, I show that both refer back to an ancient source and have an allegorical meaning. One proof supporting this v iew; is that this particular tree, the Acacia, has from time imm emorial been more or less s acred in the near East. In ancient Egypt the e arliest form s of the legen d of Osiris relate that it was an acacia which grew up round the coffin of Osiris, and not a tamarisk as in the later versions. (See An Examination of the Masonic Ritual, by Major Sanderson). In like mann er this tree is s acred in Arabia, India, and many pa rts of Africa, while it is the Sh ittim wood of the Old Testament, from which the ark was made. No doubt in this reverence for the acacia we have a survival of the primitive veneration for trees, usually spoken of as \"tree and serpent worship.\" In India the assouata tree is s tated to be a symbol of Trimurti, The Three in One. Its roots represent Brahma, its trunk Vishn u, and its branches Sh iva, the Destroyer. At any rate we can regard the acacia tree as in itself an emblem of the resurrection, for the tiny seed which is buried b rings forth a mighty tree, covered with fragrant blossoms. The account of the mann er in which the Cas. S...s c ame into existence, though ingenious, can h ardly be taken as historic. As we have already dealt with this point previously, we shall only say that every folk - lore student is well aware that, in the vast majority of cases, legends purporting to explain the origin of a certain custom do not give the real origin at all, but merely indicate that the origin of the custom has been l ost, owing to its great antiquity. The very mann er in which some of the S..s are given is s ufficient to indicate that they did not originate in the way suggested, while, on the other hand, we find these same S...s all round the world, with entirely differe nt explanations as to their origin. They are indeed ancient landmarks, and the utmost care should b e taken n ot to alter them in any way. The next incident in the legend is the capture of the scoundrels. In some rituals it is given with much interesting de tail of a picturesque nature. All agree that they were apprehended in a tavern, and many say explicitly that it was near the sea shore. Some of the rituals s tate that the fugitives were overheard lamenting as follows: - \"One said, \u0000 Oh, that my t. had b een c .a. rather than I should have done it; \u0000 while another m ore sorrowfully exclaimed, \u0001 Oh, that my h...t had b een t.o. rather than that I should have struck him; \u0000 and a third voice"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 28 brokenly said, \u0001 Oh, that my b. had b een s. in t. rather than that I should have smitten h im, \u0000 \" This last version is of interest as explaining the legendary origin of the py. of the three degrees, and incidentally it shows how legend incorporates facts into a story, in order to explain something whose original meaning is lost. It wou ld also appear from this v ersion as if the scoundrels had not intended to actually kill their victim but merely to terrorize him, and in the excitement of the moment lost t heir heads. Symbolically this c ontains a valuable piece of teaching. According to o n e interpretation the three scoundrels represent \"The lust of the flesh, and the lust of the e yes, and the pride of life\" (1 John , 2. 16). In other words, the sins of the flesh, the sins of the Soul, such as covetousness, and spiritual pride, the most deadl y of all. These sins assuredly destroy man both physically and spiritually, yet it can truly be said that in giving way to them no man intends to destroy himself. From the more strictly Christian standpoint the three scoundrels are Herod, Caiaphas, and P o ntius Pilate, and it is perfectly clear that Pilate and Herod, at any rate, did not wish to kill our Lord; but were caught in a position from which they found it impossible to escape. Returning to the deeper m ystical interpretation we notice that the scou ndrels were found in the West, the region of Death, which teaches us that the just retribution for all our sins, whether of body, soul, or spirit, will overtake us after death, and that though in one sense it is God, here shadowed forth by K.S., who punish es, yet in another sense it is our five spiritual faculties which themselves rise up in judgment against us. We ourselves, doom ourselves, and therefore we can obtain n othing but strict justice. Without pretending that we have e xhausted this s ubject, this brief explanation of the true character of the scoundrels and their captors must suffice, and we will only mention in passing that here also there appears to be a half forgotten astrological reference to the three winter m onths which oppress the sun. CHA PTER VIII THE TRACING BOARD, ETC. The next part of the narrative is incorporated in most English workings with the Tracing Board. The most interesting feature is the description of the g.. It is obvious that peculiar stress is laid on the center, even in the present form of our r itual, because of the way in which the measurements are given. Why should it not have been said that it was s ix feet long? In some old rituals the g.. or rather the monument, is described as a dome, which made a complete circle at its base, and was three feet from the center every way. If so it must have been like a small replica of the e arliest form of the Buddhist Pagoda, and the Master was thus buried at the center. In that case the top of the dome would have been five feet from the surface of the ground, and we should thus get the correct symbolic use of 5 as representing the body, and 3 as representing the spirit, while e nabling the human body to be decorously interred. It seems probably that when the g.. was made to conform to the type familiar in"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29 29 England, a desperate e ffort was made to retain the 3 and 5 . It is worth n oting that there is no mention of the use of any c...f... n, despite the picture on the tracing board, and if a c...f.... n h ad b een used at t he supposed d ate of t he incident it certainly would not have been of the European shape depicted, but much more like an Egyptian S arcophagus. Nevertheless, though the ritual does not justify the e xistence of any c..f.... n on the tracing board, it was an integral part of the an cient mysteries of Osiris, and its retention in other r itual is almost certainly an ancient landmark. On the same tracing board may be seen certain letters in the Masonic c ypher, which are practically never explained. Very often when transliterated, among other things, they will be found to give the P.W. leading to the three degree. This fact is of interest, for the true meaning of that W., as already explained, is a w...k...r in m...ls, the correct description of H.A.B. The fact t hat he was buried as near the Sanctum Sanctortum as possible, symbolically denotes that he had reached the center, and was in union with the Source of All. The Dorm er window historically is the hypostyle, the method b y which Egyptian and classical temples obtained light. The pilla rs of the central nave of such temples rose considerably higher than the roofs of the aisles, thus leaving openings through which the light could enter the building. These, however, were many in n umber, and it is difficult to justify the apparent statement that there was only one such opening. Symbolically it is intended to represent the means by which the Divine Light penetrates into the deepest recesses of every man \u0000 s nature. The squared p avement has already been explained under the section dealing with the mosaic pavement, in the first degree, and our r eaders are therefore referred to it. Briefly, it indicates that man \u0000 s progress towards the center is through alternate e xperiences of good and evil, darkness and light, mercy and severity, life and d eath. The Porch which is the e ntrance to the Sanctum Sanctorum is the gateway of death. The working tools, \"as in other cases, contain much sound moral teaching of typical 18th Century work, but there is one implement which deserves rather more than passing at tention. For what follows I must express my indebtedness to W. Bro. Sir John Cockburn, P.G.D. The s..k...t does not appear to be much in use among Operative masons. It is used b y g ardeners, but the Operative mason h as other m eans for m arking out the ground for the foundations. This implement has more than a superficial resemblance to the Caduceus of Mercury, and Sir John Cockburn suggests that it has been employed to replace this \"Heathen\" emblem. For m y part, I think this is most probable, for it is c lear that at the beginn ing of the 19th century a deliberate attempt was made to eliminate this emblem from our ceremonies. The jewel of the Deacons in the 18th century was not a dove, but a figure of Mercury, bearing the Caduceus. A number of these old jewels c an be seen in the library of Grand Lodge, and there are still a few old Lodges which continue to use them, instead of the modern jewel. Now this jewel is far m ore appropriate to the Deacons than is a dove. A dove is the e mblem of peace and a carrier pigeon bears messages, but neither"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 30 of these birds do all the work of the Deacons. Mercury, however, was the Messenger of the Gods, and carried the instructions of Jupiter, thus fulfilling one set of the duties of a deacon. He was also the conductor of souls thro ugh the underworld; taking the dead b y one hand, and uplifting the Caduceus in the other, he led the Sh ade from the grave, through the perils of the underworld, to the Elysian Fields; before his Caduceus the powers of evil fled. In mediaeval eschatology it is Christ who leads the Souls on a similar journey, uplifting in His Hand the Cross of Salvation. Even to - day the jewels of the Deacons in a Mark Lodge bear the Caduceus, a mute but convincing witness to the use of this emblem in Freemasonry. We can thus see that on the one hand a deliberate e ffort was made to delete from our ceremonies the Caduceus, probably because it was c onsidered to be Pagan, while on the other hand it was c learly quite e asy for ignorant Masonic furnishers, in the course of years, to make the Caduceus approximate more and more to a Masonic tool, so as to fit it in with other avowedly Masonic implements. As a Masonic tool i t has v ery little significance, even to a Speculative, and is of no practical value to an Operative, but the Caduc eus would b e peculiarly appropriate to the third d egree. In short, it is an ancient landmark, an emblem of the dead and forgotten Mysteries, and symbolical of Him who leads the soul from the darkness of the grave to the light of the resurrection. Before l eaving the M.M. degree let me say to all i nstalled masters that if they have received the P.W., not the W. of an Installed master, but the P.W. leading from the M.M. to that further degree, they will find in it evidence not of a mere hint of the resurrecti on, but of the Resurrection itself, and a close association with the version of that doctrine set forth in the life of the Perfect Master. CHAPTER IX THE CLOSING Here we are reminded that we are working in symbolism, for we come back from the West, i.e. , the grave, to this material world. But we have only obtained substitutes, and we offer them as s ome consolation to the spirit, i.e., the W.M. The advance to the center of the room is an obvious reference to the other center. The s...s are comm unicated b y the body to the soul, which passes them on to the spirit. The meaning of these s....s is dealt with in the ceremony, but it is worth n oting that the word shows c learly that the s....t is to be found only through the death of the body. The actual H ebrew w o rd whose corrupt form we use really means \" My son is s lain.\" It is also well to remember that the p.s. and the s. of G.& D . (Scottish form ) are, old signs which come down from the ancient mysteries, and are still found throughout the world. A brief summ ar y of that has already been said may be helpful. The p.s. is often associated with Sh iva, the Destroyer, and is also found appropriately used at Burobudor in Java; it refers to that occult center, the solar plexus. In view of what the lost s...t is, this s i gn is therefore most significant. In other words, it is a hint to those who deserve to know w hile it conceals from those who do not."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 31 The Scottish sign of G. & D . is found all round the world, and always has the same meaning of an appeal for help. It is us ed in the most primitive initiatory rites of a boy into manh ood, and in Kenya the boy takes it to indicate that he is ready for the operation of circumcision to begin. In Nyasaland, among the Yaos, it is associated with a grave, and in Mexico the Preserver is s hown making it. He was s lain and rose from the dead, and it is c onstantly found in Mexico in the form of a carving, consisting of a skeleton cut in h alf at the center and making this s ign, as, for example, at the Temple of Uxmal. The mann er of comm un icating the s..s and the gr. are e qually old. Indeed, the lion \u0000 s grip appears to be the grip of all the Mysteries. It was the Grip of Mithra, and b y this grip Osiris was raised. Among the Druids it was also known, as is shown by a carving at Iona. I have, however, gone into the e vidence for the antiquity of our signs s o fully that I will not take up further space here. We may as well add, however, that the number \"5\" no doubt refers to the five senses of man, just as the seven steps remind us of the Egypti an sub - division of every mortal. Having received the sub. s...s the W.M., or Spirit, confirm s their use till the true ones are discovered. This last remark indicates that the quest is not ended or abandoned, in reality it has just begun; the first stage o nly has been passed, which stage is death. It also tells every Craft Mason that he a good craftsman till he has at least taken the Royal Arch. Thus the spirit acknowledges that death is a step forward. It has freed the soul of the tramm els imposed on it b y the body, and so o ur life \u0000 s work on earth, as symbolized in the Lodge, is c losed. The knocks indicate that t he spirit now dominates the soul and b ody and b efore we leave these heights it is well to point out that almost all the great religious teachers h ave taught that in some mysterious way this physical body will be transform ed, and still be used after death. In short, that matter, as well as s pirit, is part of God. Science has s hown that matter is indestructible, though its form m ay be changed complete ly, and so even after the symbolical death and resurrection, three knocks are still required. CHAPTER X CONC LUSION This then concludes the third d egree. More than any other degree in Craft Masonry it has embedded in it ancient landmarks, brought down fr om a long distant past. Under the surface lie hidden, meanings within meanings, which I make no pretence to have e xhausted. Already this book has exceeded in length either of the two previous ones, but to do full justice to the sublime degree one would req uire a volume four times as large as this. I trust, however, that I have given some help, more e specially to younger brethren, which will aid them to glimpse the deeper side of Freemasonry. If they too will strive to discover"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 32 further alternative meanings, I shall feel this labor of mine has been well repaid. Let me again warn them that just because Masonry is s o o ld, its rituals, in the course of years, have been again and again revised, and newer m eanings have continually been grafted on to the old stock. We are not entitled to say one meaning is right and another wrong. Both may be right. Christianity itself has taken over a vast mass of pre - Christian ceremonies and symbols, and the student is perfectly entitled to consider that both the Christian and the pre - Christian interpretations of these symbols are e qually deserving of respect. There is also another point which should b e borne in mind. Again and again we find that incidents and p hrases which appear to have come from the Bible, on closer investigat ion are found not t o correspond exactly with the Biblical narrative. At one time there was a tendency to say that in these cases it was our duty to substitute the Biblical version for the \"Inaccurate\" traditional form . With all due respect I venture to say that such action is totally unjustifiable. Masonry is not t he Bible. It is a traditional ritual into which 18th century revisers inserted fragments from the Bible, because that was the only book dealing with the period of the Masonic incidents which was t hen available to them. To - day, we know a great deal more about this period than did our 18th century predecessors, and the modern investigator has just cause to lament the well meaning, but misdirected, zeal of these worthy masons, who thereby have probabl y destroyed for ever valuable landmarks, which would have helped us to discover the historical growth and the symbolic meaning of many parts of our ceremonies. Such apparent contradictions, and even mistakes, as appear to exist, should b e carefully retain ed, for they are sure indications to the conscientious s tudent of a conn ection with a long distant past, which modern methods of research may enable us finally to trace to its origin. If, however, they are revised out of existence, future generations will have nothing to help them in the task of unraveling the true history and meaning of Freemasonry. If a Sn . does not correspond with the e xplanation of the mann er in which it is said to have originated, don \u0000 t alter the way of giving the Sn ., f or it is an an cient landmark. Rather try to discover if anywhere in the world that Sn . is s till used in some old ceremony which may throw light on its true origin. If H.A.B. was not buried in a c...f... n, don \u0000 t eliminate the c...f... n from the tracing board, but rather bear in mind that his great prototype, Osiris, was s o buried and that the c...f... n played a peculiarly important part in the legend which recounts his death : which legend was hoary with antiquity before K.S. was born. Finally, let me say that even if a man can n ever fathom the full meaning of the third d egree, yet there is no man worthy of the name who has passed through that third d egree but will certainly have learnt one important lesson, namely, how to d., and thereby will be the better m an. •"}]
