Masonic Charges and Lectures contained the Orator’s discourses for the 4 °- 33 ° of the Antient and Primitive Rite (Reduced Rite of Memphis), in a somewhat haphazard order. Lectures of a Chapter, Senate and Council consisted of the “lectures” (catechisms) of the 4 °- 30 °, bound up with the “Grand Book of Maxims.” Neither work was written by Yarker. Masonic Charges and Lectures was compiled from unspecified earlier sources; the 7 ° lecture for example was said in the introduction to a Kessinger Publishing reprint to be largely plagiarised from an 1852 exposé of the Northern Jurisdiction Scottish Rite rituals. On first publication the volume was subtitled “a series translated from the French.” In the introduction to Lectures of a Chapter, Senate and Council , Yarker states that the contents were “translated from the published works of Jacques Etienne Marconis” (founder of the Ri te of Memphis). Many sections were in turn drawn from earlier Masonic rites. The discourses making up the first part of this work have been re- arranged in degree order, largely based on the account of the Antient and Primitive Rite in the third edition of The Freemason’s Manual by J. How, and the retrospective survey of the degrees which comprises the final lecture. The placing of a few is conjectural. Besides these two volumes, Yarker published the constitutions, official history (read: foundation myth) and “public ceremonials” of the Antient and Primitive Rite, and in 1881 privately printed the complete rituals 4 °- 33 ° as Manual of the Degrees of the Antient and Primitive Rite . I have not so far managed to locate a copy. No attempt has been made to retain layout or pagination from the print editions. Some manifest typographical errors have been corrected, although some other apparent errors, and several near-unintelligible or nonsensical passages (mostly in the second part), possibly a result of mistranslation, have been allowed to stand. “T.S.A.O.T.U.” is an abbreviation for “The Supreme (or ‘Sub- lime’) Architect of the Universe,” a Rite of Memphis variation on the traditional Masonic title of God, or strictly speaking the Demiurge.

Mutual wants and necessities impelled our primeval brethren to seek for mutual aid and assistance; diversity of talent, inclin- ations and pursuits, rendered each one dependent upon the other; thus society was formed, and as a natural consequence, men of the same habits and pursuits were associated more intimately together not only with a view of mutual improve- ment and advantage, but from that natural impulse which is felt by congenial minds. In this manner societies were formed, and as civilization began to extend through the world, and the minds of men became enlarged by the contemplation of the works of nature, the arts and sciences were cultivated by the most ingenious of the people. The contemplation of the plan- etary system, as the works of an Almighty Artist, and the attributes of their God, gave rise to the ceremonies of religion, and the science of astronomy; the measurement of land and the division and marking of their property gave rise to geometry, and these sciences to the institution into whose mysteries you now desire to be received. Thus there has been a beautiful and uninterrupted succes- sion of cause and effect in the production of the system of morals which is here taught, an d which we firmly believe will prove to be the great instrument in the regeneration and purification of the world."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 2 If we should look upon the earth with its produce, the ocean with its tides, the coming and go ing of day, the starry arch of heaven, the seasons and their changes, the life and death of man, as being merely the accident s of nature, we must shut up all the powers of judgment and yield up ourselves to the darkest folly and ignorance. The august appearance of the planetary system, day and night, the seasons in their succession, the animal frame, the vegetation of plants, all afford subject of astonishment, of which the grea test is too mighty, but for the hand of a Deity whose works they are; the least, too mira- culous, but for the wisdom of their God. It is no wonder then, that the first institutors of Masonry should have held the sciences of astronomy and geometry in such repute as to even consider them hallowed, because by their use is demonstrated the wisdom of those immutable la ws given by the Creator, at the beginning, for the government of all things. This Institution, which was or iginally coexistent with the mysteries of religion and science, is now maintain ed by us on the principle of rendering mutual aid to each other, as well as to preserve our adoration to the Almighty Artist; and to improve our minds with the principles of science. How should we be able to discern the brethren of the great family, but through such tokens as should point them out from other men. Language is not provincial, and the dialects of different nations would not be comprehensible to men ignorant and unenlight- ened. Hence it becomes necessary to use an expression which should be cognisable by people of all nations. So it is with Masons; they are possessed of th e universal expression, and of such remains of the original language; that they can communi- cate their history, their wants and their prayers to every Mason throughout the globe, from whence multitudes of lives have been saved, when sickness, want and misery had brought them to the brink of the grave. The degrees of Antient and Primitive Masonry being of still higher importance, as containing the real secrets and principles"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"C OLLEGE ( 4 °- 7 °) 3 of the mystic institution, were to be guarded in a more parti- cular manner, both from the knowledge of the world and of those who may be unworthy of receiving them. Consequently, it was ordained that the first three, or blue degrees, which are only symbols of Sublime Masonry, should be committed to memory, that it might be thereby shown from the manner in which a Symbolic Mason discharged the duties of those prepa- ratory degrees, whether he was capable of being entrusted with the real and important secrets of the craft. Again, the history of Masonry, as contained in the higher de- grees, gives an authentic detail of occurrences found only in the archives of the sublime institution, and which are so lengthy that they fill many volumes, which it would be impossible to commit to memory unless the whole of our lives were dedicated to it. On being brought to light your attention was called to the brilliant Delta, or Shekinah, which encloses nine Hebraic char- acters, each being the initial of a name derived from an attribute of Deity, the whole surrounded by a serpent forming a circle. The initials in the nine points of the Shekinah are those of the names by which Deity was known to our ancient brethren previous to the time when the Almighty disclosed His true and ineffable name to Moses on Mount Sinai. The serpent forming the circle represents the immensity of the power of God, which has neither beginning nor end. You also perceive in the centre of the Shekinah a luminous circle enclosing a brilliant star of five points, with the letter G in the centre, the meaning of which is thus explained:—Glory, Grandeur, and Gomel; from which we understand by—Glory, God; 1 by Grandeur, the man who may be great by Perfection; 1 [“I don’t know what you mean by ‘glory,’ ” Alice said. Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. “Of course you don’t—till I tell you. I meant ‘there’s a nice knock-down argument for you!’ ” “But ‘glory’ doesn’t mean ‘a nice kno ck-down argument,’ ” Alice objected. “When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.” —Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass .]"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 4 and Gomel is a Hebrew word, which signifies thanks to God for His supreme power. It is the first word which Adam spoke on discovering the adorable Eve. You also behold in the Sanctum Sanctorum the Ark of Alliance, the golden candlestick with seven branches, having a lamp in each, also a table. The Ark of Alliance was placed in the middle of the Sanctum Sanctorum, under the brilliant star and the shadow of the wings of the cherubims, which represent the alliance which God made with his people. The Ark of Alliance was of the form of a parallelogram, two cubits and a half in breadth, and the same in height, made of shittim wood, covered within and without with gold, and decorated with a golden crown borne by two cherubims of gold. The cover of the Ark had a name; it was called the Propitiatory, a place that served to appease God’s anger. The Propitiatory contained the testimony which God gave to Mose s, the tablets of the law. These tablets were of white marble, and contained the Decalogue, written in Hebrew characters. The commandments taught were disposed on the tablets as follows; the four first pointed out the duty of man to his God, and were engraved on the first tablet; the remaining si x pointed out the obligations of man; and were engraved on the second tablet. The name of the Sanctum Sanctorum in Hebrew; is Dabir, denoting speech, and it was there the Divinity resided, and where He delivered His oracles. The hangings of the Sanctum Sanctorum are purple, blue, scarlet and white, implying awe and reverence, truth and constancy, justice tempered with mercy, and purity; they furthe r symbolise the four elements.. Moses, by command of God, constructed the Ark, and for that purpose he chose to assist him, Bezaleel, of the tribe of Judah, son of Uri and Miriam, wh o was the sister of Moses and Aboliab, of the tribe of Dan, and the most learned of the people. The Israelites testified so much ardour for the works, and offered with so much zeal to carry on the same, that Moses proclaimed by sound of trumpet that he wanted no more. They"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"C OLLEGE ( 4 °- 7 °) 5 worked after the model which God had given to Moses, who also instructed him in the number and form of the sacred vessels which were to be made and placed in the tabernacle to serve in the sacrifices. The seven-branched candlestick alludes to the seven planets, and was composed of seventy parts, which alluded to the seventy divisions of the heavenly bodies. The eye over the door of the Chapter represents the eye of God, to whose name our works are dedicated, and from whose inspection our actions can never be concealed. The Shekinah signifies visible glory, for it was a symbol of the divine presence, but in our Antient and Primitive Rite we are taught to regard it as an emblem of the cultivated mind, which disperses ignor- ance. The moral of this degree teaches us Silence and Secrecy. HI! T HE M ASON , A S ON OF G OD . M Y BROTHER , in the Fifth Degree of the Antient and Primitive Rite of Masonry, the Neophyte is called Sublime Master; he is here taught that he is the Son of God, and as such, entitled to divine love. He perceives the intimacy between divine and human nature, between God and man; in one word, the Infin- ite, with all its consequences, and man being now allied with his Almighty Father, his celestia l origin is manifested. He adheres to it with gratitude and joy. God is his soul, his light, his companion. They both unite through a mutual force of attraction, tending to the glory of God, and the perfection of man. It is a constant action of the most intimate relations be- tween the true source of life and the happy being who never ceases then to renew his youth in spite of the constant decay, variations and changes of the material form to which he is subjected. He yields without resistance to the many accidents"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 6 “and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to,” because he feels that the principle, by virtue of which he exists, is ever- lasting. All that is frail and perishable in him must be relin- quished, but all that is spiritual and divine must remain and live for ever. In one word, it is the doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul which is here plainly taught, and in which we firmly believe, because it then appears as the necessary consequence of our origin. This Degree is a solemn initia tion into the relations of God with himself, as necessary and immediate consequences of His existence. His infinite power and unavoidable tendency to produce Himself, more and more to manifest His eternal resources, and impress all over the universe His divine image and attributes, become the favour ite study of the candidate. There he is with Almighty God, with Jehovah, and he beholds how the Father of man delights in contemplating His work and enjoys His prodigious perfections. Thus closes this degree. HI! H ISTORY OF THE S ACRED V AULT OF E NOCH B ROTHER , the antique legends of Masonry, which date back fifty centuries, have descended to us, fortified by unquestion- able authenticity, through the Patriarch of our Antient and Primitive Rite, Priests of the Most High God, who officiated in the Temples of Israel and of Judah and as Hierophants of Egypt, that land of mystery, of science, and of practical operative Masonry, where to this day wonders of Masonic Art still tower- ing to Heaven their gigantic he ads, exist as incontrovertible proofs of the antiquity of our Order. These legends inform us that the Patriarch Enoch was born in the year of the world six"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"C OLLEGE ( 4 °- 7 °) 7 hundred and twenty two, according to Jewish chronology, that he lived three hundred and sixty-fi ve years, and that he walked with God, and that he was not, for God took him. Fined with the love and fear of T.S.A.O.T.U., Enoch strove to direct the minds of men in the paths of honour, truth and wisdom, but in vain; for the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. Allusions to our traditional history is found in the Cabalistical Book of Enoch, which was brought from Abyssinia, and translated from Coptic into English during the present century. 1 Enoch, overwhelmed with grief on account of the wickedness of mankind, supplicated God to bring them into the paths of Light and Truth, that they might know, fear and love the holy name of Deity. While thus pondering how to rescue the human race from their sins and the punishment due to their crimes, he dreamed that the Deity in visible shape appeared unto him, saying, “Enoch, thou hast long yearned to know my true name; arise, follow me, and it shall be revealed to thee!” Then it appeared to Enoch as if he was taken up on the wings of the wind and in an instant transported to the summit of a high mountain, whose top was hid in the Heavens and appeared to reach the stars. There he perceived amidst the clouds, in letters of brilliant light, the Mysterious, Omnific Word, whose pronunciation was then and there made known to him. Suddenly he found him- self descending perpendicularly into the bowels of the earth, passing through nine subterranean apartments, roofed with an arch, the apex of each forming a keystone, having inscribed on it mysterious characters, emblem atic of nine names or attri- butes by which Deity was known to our ancient brethren. 1 [The Book of Enoch (I Enoch) is also known as Ethiopic Enoch because the oldest complete extant texts are in Ethiopic (not Coptic); the legends of Enoch it contains have nothing apart from the central character in common with the Ninth Arch legend; the wisdom of Enoch, it implies, was rather transmitted by him to Noah and thus preserved during the Deluge.]"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 8 In the ninth and lowest arch he perceived a pedestal of marble, on which was engraved the same Mysterious, Omnific Name, revealed to him upon the mountain. Upon awakening, Enoch accepted his vision as an inspiration from Heaven, and travelled in search of the mountain he saw in his dream. Wayworn and weary, he rested in the land of Canaan, then already populous with the descendants of Adam. With the assistance of his son, Mathuselah, he constructed in the bowels of the mountain nine apartments, each roofed with an arch and having a keystone with mysterious characters upon it, even as he beheld them in his vision. This labour being completed he made two deltas of purest gold, engraving upon each two of the mysterious characters. One of the deltas he placed upon a pedestal of marble, which he erected in the deepest arch, as had been shown him in his dream, the other he retained. Having accomplished this labour he closed the aperture at the top with a square stone, having engraved on its sides the hieroglyphics which you have this day had interpreted to you. He also erected over the Sacred Arch a roofless temple of huge, unhewn stone, to the glory of T.S.A.O.T.U. That the knowledge of this sacred spot and the treasure it contained might survive the flood, which Enoch knew would soon overwhelm the world in one vast sea of ruin, he raised two columns on the hill, one of brass to resist water, the other of granite to withstand fire. On the column of granite he inscri- bed a description of the subterranean arches, on the other the rudiments of the arts and sciences. The column of granite was swept into a shapeless mass by the flood, but that of brass stood firm for ages after the deluge. This mountain was in the Holy Land opposite Mount Moriah, where King Solomon erected his glorious temple; it was in later days named Zion, and it was there that the ark of the covenant was placed until the Sabbatical year 1045 before the Christian era, when it was brought from the house of Aminadab, at"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"C OLLEGE ( 4 °- 7 °) 9 Kitjath-jearim by King David, and sixty thousand choice men of Israel. Enoch having finished the Sacred Vault, gave to his son Mathuselah, the delta which be r etained, with strict charge to give it to his grandson Noah; this was accomplished according to his desire. After this, Noah entered the ark with his three sons and their families, and were, by Divine will, preserved from the deluge that destroyed the rest of the human race. Mizraim, the grandson of Ham, led colonies into Egypt, and laid the foundation of that Ki ngdom. The colonists carried with them the sacred delta of the Patriarch Enoch, and confi- ded it to the care of the hierophants or priests, who carefully preserved it in their splendid templ es on the banks of the Nile. Hermes Trismegistus, who was looked upon as the interpreter of the Gods, was one of the most learned of the hierophants; he deciphered the sacred characters upon the brazen obelisk, and was the inventor of many useful arts; to him was ascribed the reformation of the Egyptian year. 1 He prophesied that there would arise in the East a great king who would erect a magnificent temple, to the glory of T.S.A.O.T.U. and whose renown would penetrate to the remotest parts of the earth; and he charged the priests to transm it his instructions that when this great king should arise, they would give into his keeping the sacred delta of the Patriarch Enoch. This prophecy was fulfilled in the person of Solomon, during the reign of Hiram of Tyre, who initiated him into the Mys- teries which had spread from Egypt, and gave him the sacred delta which Solomon caused to be suspended in the East of his hall of audience. It is a symbol of divine truth. From the time of Enoch, the true pronunciation of the sacred name remained unknown, until the Almighty was pleased to reveal it to the prophet Moses, when he commanded him to go 1 [As it happens, passages of the Book of Enoch are generally believed to be an argument for calendar reform.

And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM; and he said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel; I AM hath sent me unto you.” Moreover, he said, “I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. “I am Jehovah, and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac and unto Jacob, by name of El Shaddai, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.” 1 Moses revealed the sacred name to Aaron, to Joshua the son of Nun, and afterwards it was communicated to the high priests and the seventy elders. The word being composed of conson- ants only, the pronunciation was lost, except to the few favoured by the Almighty. Solomon being desirous of erecting a temple upon Mount Zion, selected as a site the spot on which the Temple of Enoch formerly stood, and to this end directed that the stones and rubbish should be removed. Our Masonic traditions say that Benaiah, the Captain of the Guard; Stolkin, who discovered the sprig of acacia at the temporary grave of H.A.; and Johaben, a favourite officer, wh om you have had the honour to 1 [Ex. iii. 7 , 14 , 15 ; vi 2-3 . In respect of the last, Gen. iv. 26 assures us that in the time of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam, men began “to call upon the name of Yahveh” ( hwhy \\`b arql ). While in the Book of Genesis Abraham does not directly addr ess God by the name hwhy he nevertheless is said to use this name when referring to God in conversation (e.g. Gen. xiv. 22 ) and at xxii. 22 , names the place where he nearly sacrificed his son, Yahveh-yirah , “Yahveh will provide.” In xxv. 25 , Isaac calls on the name of Yahveh; in xxviii. 13 , Yahveh announces himself to Jaco b by that name, declaring “I am Yahveh the God of Abraham thy father &c.” and again in xxviii. 21 , Jacob makes a vow that if God ( \\yhla ) would be nice to him, “then shall Yahveh be my God.” Of course, there is no ‘con tradication’ if we simply assume that Yahveh was lying to Moses.]"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"C OLLEGE ( 4 °- 7 °) 11 represent, were charged to survey the ground and lay the foundation. In doing this, they discovered and brought up to King Solomon and Hiram of Tyre, those important objects by which we have been enabled to recover the lost word of a Master Mason. Tito Zadoc, the high priest, was raised to this degree after the death of H. A., to honour the great servant of the Most High, who was the most powerful king then on earth, whose wisdom far exceeded that of all men, and set above the great and learned Hiram, King of Tyre. The rest who were admitted to this degree obtained admission into the obelisk without attendance, but unto the Sanctum Sanctorum or Holy of Holies, only with permission and in the presence of Tito Zadoc, the high priest, and having the glorious veil of the temp1e, which separated the holy place fr om the most holy, or Sanctum Sanctorum, thrown aside by twelve priests, representing the twelve tribes of Israel; they were permitted, during the reading of the law by the chief priests of the tribes of Israel, to view that glorious treasure; exhibited in due form by the high priest. Into King Solomon’s private arch the high priests entered, accom- panied by King Solomon himself, and Hiram, King of Tyre, whilst the nine grand officers guarded the nine arches that led from the residence of the king on Mount Zion to the Arch under Mount Moriah; and in this solemn and secret spot the obligation of this degree was taken in the presence of the high priests, and kings of Jerusalem and Tyre. 1 The Tyrian Architects, or men of Gebal, employed at Jerusalem were the successors of the Dionysian Artificers, who at a remote period had brought the arts from Egypt to the shores of Asia Minor. They were initiates of the Mysteries of Dionysos and famed for their skin in working metals, timber and stone, and in whatever was great and ornamental in archi- tecture. They had already erected the Temple of Hercules in 1 [This paragraph is lifted from the legend of the “Rite of Perfection” degree of Provost and Judge; see, e.g. , the versions printed by Carlile.]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 12 Tyre and many magnificent buildings in Asia Minor. The Israelites being shepherds and tillers of the ground were under the necessity of employing these Dionysiacs, and an hundred thousand brethren were united in Jerusalem to labour in their Symbo1ical Lodges for the glory of T.S.A.O.T.U. Upon them Solomon heaped well deserved benefits and descended in peace to the tomb, after having enjoyed, during a long course of years, unequalled felicity. From the day when the inspired Solomon had built his Temple, the Masonic Science extended its beneficent rays from the Nile to the Jordan; the people joyfully united in sweet and cordial fraternity; the sacred fire burned in Chaldea, its pacific torch enlightened all Judea; in short peace reigned in all the East until the infamous Cambyses carried sword and fire into Egypt and made of it a theatre of devastation and death. 1 In this frightful overthrow civilization was arrested at a blow, but though our Sublime Institution slumbered it was not extin- guished. After a short time we hear of it as a secret school embracing two classes or orders divided into degrees, operative or handicraft, and speculative or contemplative, having signs and words some of which are known to be identical with modern Freemasonry; intimate with Egyptian lore but trans- mitting it orally, possessing the names of the angels and a symbolical and cabalistical interpr etation of Scripture the relics of which are found in our Colleges and Chapters; the dual doctrine of good and evil, and a sublime Spiritual Philosophy. 1 [With the minor exceptions that the Assyrians and Egyptians periodically ravaged Judea on their way to attack each other, the Assyrian empire was destroyed by a motley alliance of Arabs, Medes, Babylonians and others, Jerusalem was razed to the ground—wit h not one stone of Solomon’s temple left standing upon another—by the ar mies of the Neo-Babylonian kingdom, and Babylonia was in turn conquered seventy years later by the Persian Empire under Cyrus. Cambyses was the immediate successor of Cyrus.] HI!"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"C OLLEGE ( 4 °- 7 °) 13 T HE I NEFFABLE N AME . S IR K NIGHT , the Antient and Primitive Rite is the system that taught the patriarchs of antiquity to render homage to T.S.A.O.T.U. It has for its basis the belief in the existence of God, and the immortality of the soul; for its aim the practice of benevolence and virtue. It is the fraternal chain that links the brethren together in bonds of Faith in God who redeemeth, of Charity which blesseth, and of Hope in immortality. These degrees are founded on a knowledge, belief and ador- ation of the Sacred Word, or name of God, which is the foundation of every branch of masonry and religion, ancient or modern. “In the beginning was the word , and the word was with God, and the word was God .” This same word, however mysterious it may appear to the profane, has been understood and held sacred by all Masons who have been exalted to the high degrees, throughout the world; the belief in the eternity of God being the foundation of every religion known to the world. Our ancient Hebrew brethren recognised twelve mysterious or cabalistic names by which they expressed the attributes of Deity, namely, three names of three letters each, Jod , Jao and Jah ; three names of five letters each, Eliah , Joheb , and Jobel ; three names of seven letters each, Shaddai , Adonaih and Jakinai ; and three names of nine letters each, Jahbulaum , Elehannan and Yod-he-vo-he . 1 These letters being combined give the numerical signs, and are thus explained; 3 × 3 = 9 ; 3 × 5 = 15 ; 3 × 7 = 21 ; 3 × 9 = 27 . Then adding 9 , 15 , 21 and 27 the amount is 72 , being the number of the Sanhedrim of Jerusalem. You are already acquainted with the fact that the true pro- nunciation of the name of God was revealed to Enoch, and that 1 [In the Hebrew orthography, very few of these names have the stated number of letters. The number 72 is more usually obtained by writing out hwhy in a Tetraktys or “wing” formation and using the numerical values of the letters, thus y + hy + why + hwhy = 10 + 15 + 21 + 26 = 72 .]"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 14 he engraved the letters composing that name on a triangular plate of gold. The name was represented by four Hebrew consonants, and the vowel sounds of this language being represented by points placed above the consonants composing the mysterious word, at different ages received different pronunciations. Hence though the method of writing this word remained uniform, its pronunciat ion underwent many changes. These changes constitute what is termed the different ages of Masonry. These are three, and are thus estimated; After the death of Enoch the Ineffable Name was pronounced by Mathuselah, Lamech and Noah, J UHA ( Ye-haw ), three ages. Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, Ab raham, Isaac and Judah, J OVA , ( Yo-waw ), seven ages. Shem, Araphaxad, Salah, Eber, Peleg and Hezron, J EVA ( Ye-waw ), five ages. Hezron and Ram, J EVO , ( Yay-wo ), Aminadab and Nahasson, J EVAH , ( Ye-way ), Salom, Obed and Boaz, J OHE , ( Yo-hay ), and by Jesse and David, J EHOVAH ( Ye-ho-waw ), in all nine ages. The true pronuncia- tion of the name was revealed to Enoch, Jacob and Moses, and on that account are not named in this enumeration. The perfect number is thus formed: the sum of the ages of Masonry, 3 , 5 , 7 and 9 , = 24 , multiplied by 3 gives the product, 72 , to which add the number of corrupted words, 9 , the amount is 81 . the age of a Knight of the Secret Vault. The mysterious words which you received in the previous degrees are all so many corruptions of the true name of God which was engraved on the triangle. Moses did not ask for the true name of God, but for the true pronunciation of it, which had been lost through the wickedness of mankind. It was enacted in the Mosaic law, that any one who mentioned the name of Jehovah blas- phemously should be stoned to death, and on this account the name has always been called Shemhampheraush , the “unutter- able name.” 1 1 [ Shemhamphorash is more usually glossed “divided Name” or “Name of extension” and refers to the seventy-two fold name or set of 72 three-letter names obtained by various Kabbalistic jugglings from three consecutive verses (with 72 letters each) of the Book of Exodus.]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"C OLLEGE ( 4 °- 7 °) 15 This ends all of Masonry connected with the Temple erected by Solomon.

In this captivity the people had an opportunity of studying"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 18 the pure spiritual religion of the children of Japhet, which, in Persia, had abandoned entirely all sensuous representations, such as they had beheld in Egypt to the worship of Osiris, and among the neighbouring Canaanitish nations to El and Bel. The Zoroastrian faith said to them: Be good, gentle, humane and charitable; love your kind, console the afflicted, pardon those who have driven you offence. Daniel had been promoted to the office of chief of the Magi, Astrologers and Soothsayers. Ezra re-edited the Jewish Scriptures, and there is no doubt that a contact with the faith of Cyrus modified that proneness to idolatry which had hitherto oppressed the people. From this time, the nation began to look forward to the coming of a Messiah, who would again restore the glory of the kingdom. Zerubbabel, descended from the princes of his nation, had the courage to return at the head of the people of Jerusalem, to re-establish the temple on its old foundation. 1 To this end he bore the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other, because he was annoyed by his enemies. 2 Many who were dispersed among the neighbouring people, on learning the news of the re- building, came to offer their assistance, but were not admitted until they had given proofs of their zeal and courage, by rigor- ous trials to which they were submitted. After many difficulties the workmen succeeded in establishing the temple on its foun- dations; but it differed from the first, so far as the sentiments excited were also different. The ancients who had seen the glory and splendour of the first Temple shed tears of bitterness; 1 [According to the Book of Ezra, it was only following agitations by a couple of freelance preachers called Haggai and Zechariah that Zerubbabel and the then High Priest, Jeshua, first erected an altar to Yahveh and subsequently had word on a second temple begun.] 2 [This motif is drawn from the Book of Nehemiah (cap. iv) and strictly speaking alludes to the rebuilding of the city walls under Nehemiah during the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus, some decades after the temple was fin- ished; still, it is prima facie reasonable that Zerubbabel’s workmen needed similar precautions, although Zerubbabe l had only himself to blame for such annoyance since he arrogant ly snubbed the other loca l worshippers of Yahveh ( i.e. the Samarians) when they offered to help rebuild the temple.]"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"C HAPTER ( 8 °- 11 °) 19 but T.S.A.O.T.U. consoled them by an event which proved to them that they had found grace in His sight, and that he would again dwell among them. The new temple was finished, the Altar of Sacrifice and that of Perfumes rebuilt and the people instructed in the laws by Esdras. Nehemiah arranged every- thing for the solemn dedication of the temple, and knowing that the sacred fire had been hid in a dry deep pit at the des- truction of the temple, he sent the priests to search for it. Not finding any fire there, but only thick, muddy water, he, full of confidence, took it and poured it on the altar; it ignited at once and consumed the sacrifices in presence of the people, who gave themselves up to the purest joy at the sight of an event which again raised the glory of the nation. 1 HI!

They have made you feel the necessity of purging your soul of vice, and, the passions and prejudices which obscure the intellect and deprive the soul of all its energy. They have at the same time proved to us your zeal, docility, and love of the Order and of mankind. We have thought you worthy of the recompense which is at our dispo- sition. My brother, are you fi nally determined to follow this new path which opens before you? The ordinary man has often virtue on his lips, but the true Mason carries it in his heart. Examine yourself seriously, my brother, and answer. The Temple of Jerusalem is the grand type of Masonry. The revolutions it has undergone will recall to you those changes which the Masonic Order has suffered at different times. The Masonry instituted by the chiefs of the workmen at the Temple of Solomon, and rebuilt by Zerubbabel, presents but the solid principles and the pure morality which tend to make man better and more useful to others; to teach him his duties and elevate him to the dignity of his existence. So long as it was practised on this basis, the Orde r necessarily flourished, and all its members were respected. Such was its first state, which is figured to you by the Temple of Jerusalem, which was in its splendour under King Solomon, and was the glory of all nations. But from the time that indolence was introduced into the Order, and members admitted who were little disposed to follow its principles, and neglected the prescribed virtues, and introduced vices which had until then been banished; then was seen an unstable mixture of worthy men,—in manners, know- ledge, and benevolence,—with others, who, having but the appearance of those virtues, with the insulting arrogance of vice, gave a mortal blow to the reputation which Masonry enjoyed. Envy, jealousy, and calumny, gave rise to powerful enemies; its ceremonies and mysterious practices became suspected, and served as a pretext for graver imputations, injus- tices and persecutions, from wh ich it has so often and so"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"C HAPTER ( 8 °- 11 °) 21 severely suffered. Pride, so fa miliar to the man who has lost sight of all that should humili ate him,—pride to belong to a body which had so long excited the admiration of all who knew it, was the source of all its evils. The vices which resulted therefrom burst on the entire Order; it was persecuted and lost its prestige. The second and degenerate state of our Order, renewed by the improper conduct of many of its members, is represented to you by the burning and sack of Jerusalem and its Temple. But, as in that revolution its foundations were pre- served, even so true Masons, yielding for a time to the torrent, have guarded carefully the prec ious deposit transmitted to them, and when they have seen a multitude of Masons, like the Israelites, repairing their faults, then they have again brought forth those rules in all their primitive splendour. Like Esdras, of old, they have made the Masonic fraternity feel the necessity of purging the lodges of innovations which the second state of the Order had introduced. Thus the Temple has been re-edified, the sacred word has been again found, and Masonry has resumed its ancient glory, which will be preserved so long as Masons keep in view the invariable principles on which it is founded. This is the actual state of the Order represented to you by the third epoch of the temple re-established by Zerubbabel. It remains for us to explain the connection of Hiram Abiff with the Order. Hiram, the sublime workman, endowed, according to the holy writings, with intelligence and rare knowledge, surnamed Abi ff, which, according to some, signifies, “sent from God,”—this man, revered by Hiram, King of Tyre, as a father, esteemed, cherished and honoured by Solomon, who was guided by his counsel,—is at once the father and model of true Masons, the particular type of the Order and of the three states of which I have presented to you the picture. The history of his assassination by three fellowcrafts is an ingenious fiction, favoured by the silence of the holy writings; it however veils great truths for the Mason who would instruct himself. Each circumstance of his life, and the mournful event"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 22 which Masons celebrate in their works, teaches the virtues they should practice, of which the example is now before you. Hiram, living respected, cherished and directing all, represents the Order in its primitive state, when it was known only by its good deeds and the admiration it excited. Hiram, in the temple, praying each night when the workmen had retired, teaches Masons that they owe more to the Supreme Being than to the profane. Hiram assassinated by three fellowcrafts who would force from him the Word, indicates the danger of violent passions, which may lead us to the greatest extremes if they are not at once repressed; and the injustice of those, who without taking the trouble to labour themselves, would tear from others their discoveries and partake with them of the fruits thereof. The refusal of Hiram teaches that discretion should ever be the favourite virtue of a Mason. Lastly, his tragical death announces the second state of the Order, succumbing through the bad conduct of some of its members, designated by the fellowcrafts, under the characters of avarice, calumny, and injustice. Hiram, the particular type of the Masonic Order, and of the three epochs, is today presented to you as rising from the dead. Aid us to recall him to life, surrounded by the virtues which he practised. and which will conduct to that immortality to which all should aspire who would. imitate his fidelity to truth and honour.

I T NOW REMAINS to reveal to you, more amply, the mystic doctrines of the new grade which you have obtained; for the eyes of one newly initiated are too feeble to sustain the bril- liancy of the Masonic light, if exposed without due preparation, and it is for this reason that numerous steps go to the formation of the symbolic ladder of our venerated institut ion. Moses, trembling, vanquished before the fires of Sinai, nor daring to pierce the burning bush, which separated him from the Great Jehovah, is a palpable emblem of the profane who comes to seek truth in our Temples; he can only acquire it by constancy in all the trials to which he is exposed, and by a living faith in our sublime institution. A man destit ute of faith is only wise accor- ding to the world; remember that Pythagoras, the greatest of the Grecian Philosophers, who was instructed in the wisdom of Egypt, exacted of his disciples a long novitiate of which silence and faith were the basis:—“The Master has said it,” was the all- sufficient answer 1 to certain Sophists, or great professors of the art of doubting, which is not knowledge but the negation of it. Release yourself from material trammels, if you wish to pursue gloriously your Masonic ca reer. Study our symbols; alle- gory is the voice of wisdom; purify your heart; spread in the world the words of wisdom; teach mankind to perfect the useful arts; to love each other; and to guide those who wander from the sentiments of virtue; instruct the ignorant and solace those who suffer. At the beginning and before the establishment of societies, man, born pure, seemed to have by instinct or divine intuition, the most noble virtues and generous inspirations; goodness was 1 [Anyone for whom such a crude argumentum ad verecundium suffices has forfeited any right they may have ever had to the name of philosopher.]"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 24 natural to him, and as evil did not exist, he could not comprehend it. Love of his kind and charity, that sweet and pure ray of the uncreated power, was the only motive of his actions. He lived in others more than in himself, and he reduced everything to a single word—Lov e. In his fellowman he saw but a brother with whom he shared without hesitation. This happy time, the golden age, has passed away, but the power of recalling it is the mission of Masonry. And, what in effect, is more divine than the morality of Masonry? What more sublime than this Charity, which is its soul? To love man as oneself, to love them in God and for God, without reserve or exception; to love even our own enemies, forget injuries, pardon offences, overcome evil with good; to rejoice with those who are in joy, and grieve with those who suffer; enlighten those who are in darkness; reclaim in secret those who err; assist the unfortunate; to judge not rashly lest we judge ourselves; to consider our talents as lent for the use of the T.S.A.O.T.U., in the economy of his providence; to fulfil from conscientious principle all the duties which our position imposes upon us; never to seek our own interest, but to sacri- fice it for the general good; to respect God in those whom he has established for our governance. Behold, Knight, in this description, that which Masonry prescribes to us, in regard to men and society; and that which the true Mason realises every day by his conduct; good, sensible, affable, compassionate, generous, merciful and clement; a faithful subject, a sincere friend, worthy husband, good, father, tender son, careful and vigilant master, full of charity and regard for all; he foresees all wants, fulfils all laws, satisfies all beneficial needs, follows all honest desires, and surrenders hi mself to good works and bene- volence. Bound to all men by his bonds of fraternity, he will fly on their behalf to the ends of the earth, and, new apostle, he will carry, if he can, truth, justice and peace to all hearts. If we had a world of true Masons the earth would be the sojourn of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"C HAPTER ( 8 °- 11 °) 25 innocence and happiness. Be then charitable, for we are the image of God upon earth. Our sublime institution is not less worthy of our admiration and homage than the virtues which it inspires in us. To self love it opposes the renunciation of our own will and the hatred of all unruly desires; to our pride the knowledge of our nothing- ness, producing sentiments of profound humility; to cupidity, the spirit of liberality; to luxury mortification; to a lively desire for sensual good, the desire of celestial and spiritual good; to sallies of humour, sweetness and patience; everything in short that tends to the use of all good things with moderation and wisdom, in order that we may be pure and able to defend ourselves from even the thought of evil. The more we study Masonry, the more we discover in it those characteristics of true wisdom which arrest, enchant and penetrate the heart with love: and the mind with admiration. Tell me, I pray you, of an excess which it blames not; an evil under its eyes which it attempt s not to remedy; an uncurbed passion; a disorder without condemnation; a good work without recompense! What admirable wisdom in the maxims of our order, in the love which rules it, in the friendship which sancti- fies it, in the worldliness which it modifies, in the talents which it ennobles, in the self-love which it corrects; in the prosperity of which it shows the quicksands; in adversity of which it assua- ges the heaviness, in the duties of which it inspires us with the love. Even in death it modifies in us the fear of it, awakens the desire for it, and assuages its ho rrors. Forget not then, Brother Knights, that pain and pleasure pass away as a shadow, life runs down in an instant; nothing in itself, its value depends upon its employment. Our ceremonies assure you that the Mason arrives at complete initiation only though the gate of death. Do not think that a single being is placed upon earth by chance, merely to live, suffer an d die.

H ISTORY OF THE D EGREE OF R OSE C ROIX . I HAVE NOW to inform you, my brethren; that the Order of the Rose Croix is of the highest antiquity, and has a double origin assigned to it, the one historic and the other philosophic. It was founded by Ormus, who was a Serapian Priest at Memphis, and a friend of the Christian Apostles. Converted by St. Mark in the year 46 , he reformed the doctrines and ceremonies of the Egyptians by the recognition of the law of the Apostles. His disciples united with the Essenes, who had founded Lodges or Schools of Solomonic science, and travelled from the East to propagate their secret doctrines in the West, where they in- structed their pupils in the mysteries of religion and philosophy. The Society, thus became divided into two sects, or orders, known as conservators of the Mosaic secrets, and conservators of the Hermetic secrets, or the doctrines of the Egyptian Thoth. The Rosicrucians of the twelfth century, were Hermetic philosophers, who derived from an anterior association which came from the East, with the mission of propagating the secret sciences in the West. Three of them founded in Britain a philosophical seminary, where they taught the sublime sciences. Of these some joined the Crusaders to fight in Palestine, side by side, with those valiant Maccabees, and became known as Knights of Palestine and Knight s of the Rose Croix, forming themselves into armed associations for the protection of pil-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"C HAPTER ( 8 °- 11 °) 27 grims who visited the Holy City; there they cultivated our mysteries and entrusted them to Guarimont, Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Hugh de Payens in the year 1118 . In Germany, it is related that one Christian Rosy Cross was born in 1387 , and making a voyage to the Holy Land he had at Damascus some conferences with wise Chaldeans from whom he learned the occult sciences; after which he perfected himself in the Lodges of Egypt, Lybia and Constantinople. Returning to Germany, be established an order, of which the substance descended to the Freemasons of Britain and Germany, by different channels, The Rosicrucian branch of the Masonic tree consisted primarily of three classes; and promotion from one class to another was only accorded to me rit. Candidates for the first class were required to posse ss a veritable knowledge and approved morality, and to have rendered services to humanity. The aim of the sublime institution was to place enlightened men under shelter from vulgar error during their philosophical studies, and to inspire them with strong desires for their moral perfection. for benevolence, love of labour, and the practice of all those virtues which give to man, delicate and generous sentiments and the love of humanity. The Neophyte was admitted to the second class when be possessed that happy disposition which warms the soul with enthusiasm; a true Knight in defence of the weak and oppressed, and compre- hending that ardent philosophy which has produced those re- vered men, whose passage on earth was marked by great benefits. The entry to the third class was accorded only to those few, who, to wisdom of spirit, added morality of heart, nobility of soul, constancy and firmness of character, which are virtues worthy of heaven and the love and admiration of the brethren. The Mystic Cross attaches to the ancient Masonic worship, and formed a part of its symbolism, the knowledge of which was a part of the secret instruction. This sign or symbol is a natural"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 28 one. The ancient Romans had ensi gns, flags and crosses, gilded and beautified. When a man, in the hour of overwhelming distress, prays his Father to have mercy upon him, he extends his hands heavenwards and makes precisely the same figure. In Egypt, the illiterate gratitude of a superstitious people, while they adored the river on whose inundations the fertility of their provinces depended, could not fail of attaching notions of sanc- tity and holiness: to the crosses which were erected on the banks of the Nile. It was held in the earliest ages, among the Egyptians, Arabians and Indians, as the signification of the life to come—of eternal life. To us it has become, as in the days of the Egyptians, the symbol of life to come,—of eternity, and it will serve to remind all true Masons that they must always be ready to give even their 1ives for the perpetuation and triumph of truth. The Rose which you see on the cross, is the emblem of discretion. Discretion is a necessity, lest those who are opposed to our principles should shut up our temples and dis- perse our institution, as they have done in former times, The death of one of us would not serve our cause. Martyrdom is fruitless in our days, and is not to be sought after. All we have do is to enlist good and honest men, so that an army of true and practical Masons shall array themselves against tyrants, impostors and fanatics, and prove to them that their days of successful opposition are gone forever, and their only choice is to relinquish their useless weapons and join us. Therefore we must not discuss our principles outside of our temples. We know human nature well enough to be satisfied that secresy is in itself attraction, and is a means by which we make it imposs- ible for our profane enemies to assail us with their sophistry; for we are always right when we answer them by saying “You speak of what you know not.” To argue about Masonry, a man must be a Mason, and, once admitted, he must certainly be a bad man if he does not love it with all his heart. But we must be particular in our admissions, especially in this degree. Hence, let us be prudent and act “Sub Rosâ.”"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"C HAPTER ( 8 °- 11 °) 29 My Brother, in the name of this Chapter I sincerely congrat- ulate you upon your admission to this exalted degree, which is termed the Ne plus ultra of Symbolical Masonry in some foreign systems, as for instance the French Rite. In your further advancement you will find a more mysterious significance attached to the cross, as also to the letters [I.N.R.I.], 1 which comprehend secrets of Rosicrucian science, and can only be made known in a Senate of Knight Hermetic Philosophers. In some chapters, these words are interpreted, in a sectarian and erroneous spirit, by the words Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum, but Masonry, my Brother, is universal and not sectarian, and therefore the Antient and Primitive Rite assigns to these letters and symbo1s their primitive meaning.

T HE DOGMA of the Antient and Primitive Rite of Masonry has but one thought,—to do Good; but one Banner,—that of Humanity; but one Crown,—it is for Virtue. Its origin is lost in the night of time. The most judicious historians assign as the birthplace of its philosophy, the Plains of Tartary, and trace it to our day through the sages of India, Persia, Babylon, Ethiopia, and Egypt. In an immeasurable antiquity, according to Indian monu- ments, Sages sought the light on the banks of the Ganges, and in the countries of lower India. Like us, they worshipped Truth and propagated it unostentatiously . Their doctrines were simple and devoid of superstition. They adored an Eternal God, Creator of the world, who preserves its existence and causes destruction to give birth to reproduction. This simple Theology spread throughout Egypt, India and Persia. It was cultivated by the Magi. It changed, as everything changes in the world, and was reduced to its primitive simpli- city by a second Zoroaster. Its faithful disciples still exist in Ethiopia as well as in India, among nations not now classed in the ranks of civilisation. Its vo taries assembled in the Isle of Meroe, and gave freedom and. happiness to the nations which they governed. These benefactors of the human race deemed it impossible to present the true light to rude and uncultivated minds. They veiled under emblems which the multitude construed literally, the Truth, which had her devotees in the Temples of Saïs, Thebes, Memphis and Heliopolis. Thus, as in China, Greece, and ancient Rome, as also among enlightened people of the modern world, there were two religions in Egypt; that of the multitude, which mostly addresses itself to objects of the external world, and that of the enlightened, who, disre-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"S ENATE ( 12 °- 17 °) 31 garding such objects, or viewing them only as important in an allegorical sense of sublime significance, and covering great moral truths, or great features of nature. Each city of Egypt had its peculiar symbols. Memphis, the eloquent, assumed for her- self the “Raven.” Thebes, which elevated its thoughts to heaven, decorated her banner with the “Eagle with the eye of Fire.” Canopus chose the “Incense Vase,” emblematic of Divine worship. The Sphynx, couching at the gates of the Temple, denoted the Sages that watched over Egypt. These Sages, educated in the solemn mysteries of Heliopolis, Memphis and Thebes, were the conservators of the Divine Fire. The Sacred Fire of Masonry glowed a thousand years, and no effectual attempt was made to extinguish or weaken it. On the banks of the Nile, whilst the august guardians of the Traditions veiled them from contemporary eyes, and communi- cated them only to the few whom they deemed worthy of initiation, other adepts in the interior of Africa, assembling barbarous nations, polished their manners, propagated know- ledge, and, in short, instituted our secret mysteries among the burning sands of Nubia and Ethiopia. Meroe, on one hand, gave light to her Gymnosophists on the banks of the Ganges and the Indies. Zoroaster founded the Magian School in Persia and Media, and his followers conquered Scythic and Semitic Babylon. Orpheus established the mysteries of Samothrace, which were consecrated to the Cabiri, and spread among many nations. Triptolemus gave laws to Greece, and laid down the principles of agricultural knowledge, and founded the Temple of Eleusis. Abaris carried the light into the North. The mys- teries of Memphis were introduced everywhere, even among the frozen plains of Scythia. In the early ages of mankind, all branches of science, and especially the architectural, were entrusted entirely to the Priests, or to such as they might admit by initiation; but religion, as explained by the mysteries, was the grand object,—science a subsidiary one. Such, certainly was the case in the Egyptian"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 32 mysteries, and as those of Eleu sis were brought to Greece from Egypt shortly before the departure of the Israelites, there is no reason to suppose that they were founded on different principles. But after a period or four hundred years, during which Greece had advanced much in civilisation, some of the initiated attached themselves more to one branch than another; while some devoted themselves to reli gion, others followed up more closely the paths of science; and about the year 1060 B . C ., a portion emigrated to Asia Minor, and gave that country the name of Ionia. Here the Rites received the name of Dionysian Mysteries, from a representation of the death and revival of Bacchus or Dionysos, and were no longer practised chiefly for inculcating religion, but as a necessary initiation or purification of the mind, before the candida te could be admitted to the privileges of an Architect;—for building was so peculiarly the object of this association, that its members were in after time known as the Dionysian Artificers. One of their chief cities was Byblos, the Gebal, or Gabbel of the sacred volume, and the Hebrew word Gibblim, translated ( 1 Kings v. 18 ) stone- squarers, is in another place (Ezekiel xxviii. 9 ) rendered, ancients of Gebal, which means the inhabitants of, or workmen from, Gebal, and indicates with sufficient precision that the artists sent by Hiram, King of Tyre, to Jerusalem, were a party of these famed artificers.

This was engraved, together with a mystic token or sign, upon a small white stone, which thus prepared was presented to the initiated.

St. John, of the Apocalypse, was an initiate of the Cabiri, and alluded to the mystic stone just noticed, when he says, “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a White Stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving him that receiveth it.” (Rev. ii. 17 .) The Apostle means to say, as the initiate in the Cabirian mysteries, who, with a brave heart and an unfaltering step, passes boldly through the terrible ordeal appointed to try his patience, receives a White Stone with a new name and a mysterious inscription upon it, which is a powerful resource against misfortune and gives him immunity from danger; so shall be given to the man who overcometh his passions and triumphs over vice, security from sin and misery. It will raise him to a divine companionship in celestial fraternity, and to a full participation hereafter in the mysterious enjoyments of the Secret Pavilion above. These Rites were spread through all the cities in Syria, and Hiram, King of Tyre, was a High Priest of these mysteries. This Institution existed in Judea in the time of Christ, and it is a notable fact that while he denounced in the severest terms the Pharisees and Saducees, he did not say a word against the Essenes, the faithful depositaries of the ancient Cabirian Rite. That he was familiar with this Rite is certain, for it cannot be supposed that a mind like his could pass over without due con- sideration a society like theirs, admired for amiability and gentleness of manners, and dignifi ed with so many virtues. Besides the moral sentiments, the social maxims, the idea of liberty, fraternity and equality, which distinguished the Order, differ in no respect from the teachings of Christians regarding the same things. Though the Lodges in Judea were chiefly composed of Jews, yet they admitted into their Order men of every religion and every rank of life, and like the priests of Egypt, the Magi of Persia, the Gymnosophists of India, they united the study of"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 34 Moral with that of Natural Philosophy. Although patronised by the great, and respected by all men for the correctness of their conduct and the innocence of their lives, they were persecuted by the Romans until the abolition of their Rite, about the middle of the fifth century. After the building of the Temple at Jerusalem, Freemasonry was preserved as the result of Roman laws and institutions under the incorporation of Numa Pompilius, 728 years before the common era, and maintained it s Rites, especially in Britain, until its amalgamation with the Hermetic Societies of recent times, who thus employed Masonry as subsidiary to their own development. The real secret of Masonic principles is preserved in our Venerated Ark. A part of it is in the Grand Lodges of London, Edinburgh, and also in the Convent of Maronites, on Mount Lebanon. It has come down on the stream of time, pure and unchanged as it was, when, from the Temples of Thebes and Eleusis, it excited the veneration of the world. Whilst the ordinary man is content with the appearance of mystery, and is satisfied with pronouncing some words of which he knows not the meaning, the Masonic philosopher roams through antiquity, and ascends to primary causes in the study of our institution. Whatever success may crown his toil, if the lamp of study has guided him through the labyrinth of ancient mystery, still eager to learn, he will knock at the gate of our Temples.

A MONG the mathematical sciences, Geometry is the one which has the most special reference to Architecture, and we can therefore understand. that the whole art of Freemasonry—the whole being of the Order—is comprehended in it. Freemasons, therefore, ought to make themselves intimately acquainted with Geometry, whilst the members of a Senate of Hermetic Philosophers should study our Moral Geometry to be able to deduce all their actions from Geometrical principles, and to purify by it the Temple of the body. Freemasonry is a science which requires both time and experience, and more time than many brethren can devote to it; the only time in fact they can devote to it being during their hours of recreation. Therefore it is good that it is communicated by degrees, according to the regulations of the Order, or the candidate’s power of comprehension. As in Geometry, so in Masonry, there is no royal road to perfection; a knowledge of its science can only be acquired by long and diligent study. To the candidate who rapidly passes through the degrees, Masonry is as incomprehensible as was the veiled statute of Isis, and he becomes either a useless drone in our hive, or retires in disgust from all participation in our labours.

We believe that these endowments were given to them originally by God, and that the circumstances of life which gave them the opportunity of making these acquirements in Egypt were determined by him with a view to their ultimate employment in his service."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"S ENATE ( 12 °- 17 °) 37 The Jewish system of Masonry, or religion, was made up chiefly of ceremonies, types and figures, denoting intellectual things and moral duties. This mode of teaching morality was necessary at that early period of the world; and why? because not one person in ten thousand, beside the Priesthood, could read. The people were not then able to exhibit thoughts by writing; hence, the necessity arose of teaching by signs and symbols, that where these struck the eye, they should raise corresponding ideas in the mind, and thus convey moral truths and duties by sight, and by the operation of tools and mechan- ical instruments. Every doctrine and ceremony have their mystical references; every landmark its legitimate explanations. But there are often more important antitypes than those which are commonly assigned, and though they do no t appear on the surface, are nevertheless in these times of scientific and philosophical research, the necessity of mainta ining Freemasonry in its proper rank, by investigating the tendency of its numerous details, that we may correctly ascertain whether their import be uniform, and their typical references valuable. Every symbol in the Tabernacle of Moses had its appropriate signification, which was carried into the Temple of Solomon. Both consisted of three parts: emblematical of the Terrestrial, Celestial, and Angelical worlds , namely—the Court, the Holy Place, and the Sanctum Sancto rum, the first contained the altar, which was of earthy matter, exposed to the air in an uncovered place, having on it a continual fire and surrounded with water, the which constitute the four elements of the terr- estrial world. The second was in the middle, and represented the firmament, and contained the golden altar, the table, and candlestick. The third was the dwelling place of the most High, who, by the medium of angels, condescended to commu- nicate with man. These three divisions are, moreover, the same in the modern churches of Christendom, which were erected by the Freemasons. The High Priest Josephus observes"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 38 that the twelve stones of the Ephod, and the twelve loaves on the table, represent the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and equally the twelve months of the year. The seven lamps referred to the planets, and the seventy branches of the candlestick secretly indicated the Decani, or seventy divisions of the planets. The veils composed of white linen, purple, blue, and scarlet, typified the four elements, earth, sea, air, and fire, as also the Ephod of four divisions. Two parts of the Tabernacle represented sea and land, and the third heaven. The gold referred to the splen- dour which enlightens all things. Freemasonry, my Brother, was in all times the most noble an d salutary of institutions, and from the most remote ages there was imprinted on art much concealed grandeur. The Tabernacle in the wilderness was the first model of that magnificent temple which David had put it in the heart of Solomon at the age of 18 years to erect to the honour and glory of T.S.A.O.T. U. This celebrated Temple was the symbolical image of the universe, and resembled in its dispositions the ancient myster- ious temples of Egypt and Greece. A numerical system laid at the root of the worship of the Great King; numbers above all appear to dominate in the construction of the great world. The most holy place formed a cube corresponding to the number four, by which number the ancients represented nature, the length of the edifice was three units of the breadth, and repre- sented the simple trinity; in doubling the units, the trinity dou- bles, and in multiplying the number by themselves the trinity triples. All the dispositions of the interior of the temple attach symbolically to the same system. The starry vault, or firma- ment, was sustained by twelve co lumns, which figure the twelve months of the year; the cornice which crowns it represents the Zodiac, and the twelve signs were represented by allegorical figures, so well executed that they seemed animated. Lastly, all parts of the temple corresponded to those of nature, the different emblems indicating the harmony of the whole world."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"S ENATE ( 12 °- 17 °) 39 The most fabulous accounts exist of the wealth of the arrangements. 1 The throne was placed in the east upon seven steps, representing the seven periods of creation, and seven virtues: love of God, and men, patience, vigilance, justice, strength and temperance; virtues indispensable to man for the acquisition of science and the knowledge of all things. The throne was gold, its feet were of emeralds and rubies, mixed with pearls the size of an ostrich’s egg. At the right was the statue of Jehovah, 40 feet high, containing a thousand talents of gold, holding in the hand a golden sceptre, enriched with diamonds. At the left was a fema le statue of silver, containing a thousand talents, and holding a serpent staff, the sides of the throne had representations of fruits and flowers in precious stones. The first step of the throne represented vines charged with grapes, all composed of precious stones wrought so as to represent the delicate shades of different fruits. The trees contained small birds of rich plumage. On each side of the second step were two golden lions of natural grandeur and terrible aspect. When the great Solomon placed his foot upon the first step, the birds extended their wings with a slight warble, and upon the third, the two lions placed their paws; and when Solomon attained this step a celestial harmony was heard. At the fourth the sounds became more grave and solemn. At the fifth, harmonious voices addressed Solomon in these terms: “Son of David, Master of Light, seek to know the bene- fits which the great Jehovah has spread over thee.” At the sixth, all the Patriarchs united in prayer. At the seventh, the birds still continued to flutter until Solomon seated himself upon the throne. Then, by secret mechanical means, healthy perfumes were spread around. Before the throne were two columns and a tripod of spirits of wine, of which the blue and white flames resembled the wan light of a pale meteor.

And now of this glorious temple, the creation of divine genius, what remains to day? Nothing but the historic remembrance; but God who governs all things, has willed that this vast monument, erected to his glory, should be perpetuated in the hearts of the children of light.

I LLUSTRIOUS K NIGHT , your advancement thus far in Masonry, has taught you that in our Antient and Primitive Rite the letter of the legends of antiquity, were by our Primitive Brethren disregarded and viewed only as myths, veiling from vulgar minds, important truths. It is needless to dwell on the myth of the Serpent tempter of Eve, which the old Hermetic philo- sophers viewed as a symbolical image of sensuality. In the earliest ages amongst rude and uncivilized men, the Serpent or Dragon, was regarded as sacred; according to the writers of Antiquity, the very foundation of Greece, that intellectual daughter of Egypt, was cemented by the blood of the Dragon or Serpent, when Cadmus, having slain him and plucked his teeth and sown them, there sprang forth from these seeds, armed warriors, from whom were afterwa rds to be born the sages and heroes of antiquity. This perc hance may refer mythologically to the advent of the Ophitic symbolism into Greece, and the application of the serpent to represent the Priesthood of antiquity, who were told to be wise as serpents and harmless as"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"S ENATE ( 12 °- 17 °) 41 doves; for we notice that after his death, Cadmus, like Thoth among the Egyptians, was transformed into a snake and adored under that form; still further, when the country began to be reduced to some order, Draco, that is the dragon, was first monarch at Athens. In short, the histographers and logographers are replete with. anecdote and illustrations of the worship as it then existed, depicting in their sober sincerity the state of things which prevailed, even with the savage tribes of Africa; describing their serpents as the guardians or palladiums of the cities, and as beings reverenced with every expression of abject submission. Their entire mythology abounds with similar allusions and circumstances, wherein the serpent personates a most important character. Again, the adventures of Hercules in his childhood, the death of Laocoon, the gaolers in the gardens of Hesperides, and the thousand fabulous grottos defended by the snake in some one of his varied forms, are illustrations familiar to all. As to the Latin nation, religion had become so modified up to the period of their settlement, that their mythology embodies fewer circumstances expressive of its ophitic origin than other nations springing more directly from the Orientals; still they appropriated much :from the neighbouring Greeks and Egyptians. The rapid extension of Roman and Grecian power, and with it an intercourse with the then known world, afforded but so many facilities for the propagation of their religious ideas; and, although these seldom enforced the unwilling acceptance of opinions and beliefs upon their conquered nations, still, there must have resulted from the me re communication a reciprocal influence, as might be surmised, in favour of the mightier minds. Thus the Muscovite an d Pole finally adopted a most debased form of worship, adoring the serpent as a household divinity, like the lares and penates of the classic world, decreeing it a penalty of death to injure one, however venom- ous in its character, and surrendering up to them the unres-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 42 trained freedom of their hearths. Almost all of the vipers obtained protection and reverence in an equal degree. But of the divisions of Europe, Scandinavia, embracing the Swedes, Fins, Norwegians, Danes, &c., is particularly rich in mysterious legends of this character. Its my thology abounds in allusions to, and its fables are filled with exploits of, the serpent. Lok, the genius of evil, is styled the father of the great serpent; the standards of many exhibit the same emblem, and the few hieroglyphic remains that have been discovered, bear witness of the prominent character it assumed in their belief. The only difference to be remarked, is the variation in the form of the reptile, which now assumed the most monstrous and terrific powers, breathing flames and pestilence from its distended jaws, and expressing revenge and utter slaughter in its looks. This fanciful form became a particular favourite with the earlier Christian writers, whence have resulted the heroic legends of St. Patrick, St. Michael, St. George, and St. Margaret, and the extraordinary wonders depicted in the stories of the Middle Ages. That such was the policy of the founders of most reli- gions is not a matter of astonishment, since to the uneducated mind the awful and sublime are to be represented less in things invisible than in natural forces exaggerated into terrors, in physical events partaking of the purely tragic character; in appeals, in short rather to the eye than to the subtle essence of the mind. Thus it seems to them that God rather afflicts nations in his wrath, than seeks to raise up prophets in their midst to instruct and forewarn them. The Indian Christna is fabled to have destroyed an immense serpent with a hundred heads, which infested the waters of the Yamuna, and is interpreted as sy mbolical of the destruction of evil influences. In America, the most ancient inhabitants, the Toltecs, erected an immense serpentine mound of that reptile in the act of vomiting the cosmic egg, an hieroglyphical symbol, common to them and the Egyptians, and denoting the birth of all created matter, from the universal Spirit or Kneph."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"S ENATE ( 12 °- 17 °) 43 At length, we enter into Gaul and Britain with this worship, which, like the symbolical re presentation of the Chinese, showing a dragon vomiting a flood after a fleeing man, had literally encircled the earth. The Druid worship, so famous in antiquity, was an offspring of the ophitic symbols; the same familiar snake was adored not only as a symbol of light and life, but independently; in its own animal nature, as a serpent. So close, indeed, are the affinities of their gods and goddesses, so perfect the exposition of that creed, that many incline to the opinion that the intercourse between these Isles and the ancient world was far more intimate than we are accustomed to think. Their divinities are variously pictured under the form of the snake, whilst still further to increase and cement the conn- ection of ideas, “draig” signif ies both serpent and a supreme god. Their many fables, among others that of “Uter Pen- dragon,” contain explicit and conclusive evidence of their worship, with its ambiguous refe rence to the “gliding king” pur- suing the “fair one,” even as in the garden of Eden the treacherous angel followed the credulous Eve. The same pecu- liarity to which we have referred in other nations, that of attri- buting healing powers to the serpent, is abundantly manifested among the Druids. As the Druid religion was established in Ireland and Gaul, there, no less than in England, were exam- ples afforded of the old creed. The story of St. Patrick ban- ishing the toads and serpents from Ireland has, with a great deal of ingenuity. been referred to his opposition to the existing faith and his determination to eradicat e its pernicious doctrines from the minds of the people; the ruling divinities in both countries are represented as armed with the caduceus of Mercury, or associated in some distinct manner with the serpent, either as a symbol or attribute; the same low superstitions and their resultant cruelties and barbarism are reproduced. Remains of the Druidical faith yet linger in Britain and Ireland, and were derived from the same centre as our own Oriental Rite. The cycle is thus completed, but much remains untold, were"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 44 it but the theory of the origin of the serpent worship, or its practice, as it exists in our own times. We have only to recall the numerous current stories of the fascination of the snake, its mesmeric and medicinal powers, the wonderous accounts of the ubiquitous sea-serpent that startle the world so frequently, and tales of a similar character, to understand that the old idea is not entirely dead nor the old terror entirely cast aside. In alchemical language the term serpent, and green lion, was used to denote the seed or first prin ciple of all matter. These philo- sophers still further embellished their work with serpent myths, symbols and fables, as we have here given them. But the fact is, that the original hero of all these dragon stories, was Osiris or Mythras, destroying Typhon or Ahrimanes. In the Ritual of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the good God-Man, Heseri, is symbolically and physically, light, and the Sun; whilst similarly, the evil principle is darkness, and the great dragon, Apophos, fighting for the destruction of man’s divine soul. The subject affords us a fine illustration of credulity, whether indulged by minds sottish and brutal, or active and refined. Unfortunately, in all religions, the element of fear has entered too largely; and to repent in order to be saved, is a precept more attentively followed than to do, in order to have done. And so of old, it hung like a dark mist over the intellectual sight of the world, at the dawn of science. But the sun rose at last, blood-stained, it is true, and the glorious prospects began to be revealed. Far back lay the mountains clad in purple and gold, around all flashed a golden light, whilst be yond the unfathomable vistas of space were opened; glittering with worlds through all immen- sity. And that sun was the light of knowledge, and those glowing mountain tops the past, and the golden glow and heat the present, and the future lies with those worlds dimly seen and known.

Geometrical studies led our forefathers to that of the inhabit- able world, and they soon learned to fathom the ocean of immensity, and to pierce the azure vault. Man devoted himself to mathematics; a noble science, known then but to the initiates of the Order. This science almost enabled him to develope the organization of nature, noting the Solar and Lunar causes, the Astral periods, and the changes of the seasons. The ancient astronomical system is represented by the square; the four compartments of which are the four presumed regions of the world. By obse rving the sun’s course, the four cardinal points were fixed East , West, North and South. The four squares served as angles of division for the seasons, making ninety-one days for each nearly, or three hundred and sixty- four days for the whole, one or two days being added at determined periods. The Magi studied every department of nature with attention, with a view to arrive at a knowledge of its essence. The immensity of the aerial fluid filled those fires, which they regarded as so many small Suns, and afterwards as Stars. The power of the atmosphere upon all things, and the harmony of the organic laws, caused them to admire the wonders of nature; and sharpened their energies to inquire, and to discover the vivifying principle, the soul of the Universe. They recognised by their work, the Deity, as the sole origin of organization; the husband and wife and first principle of all things. They adored the Supreme Being in all the productions of the earth. They concealed their discoveries from the people, and gave fictitious significance to those emblems which they made known to the public. They decomposed light and air and matter; salt, sulphur and mercury appeared to be its constituent elements.

These three substances were figured as a triangle, which form became, for this reason, more intimately blended with their religious worship, as an emblem of God, the great motive, whom the Hebrews named Jehovah, or the soul of nature. The Triangle was placed in the centre of divers circles and squares, to denote the vivifying principle which stretched its ramifications over all things. The Magi foretold eclipses and comets, thereby extending the influence of religious ideas, and leading to those of a metaphysical nature. The several planets, which are represented as making their course round the common centre, announce the antiquity of those great person- ages who were said to govern the earth, and were deified by admiring mortals. Apollo, the God of Light, was sy nonymous with the sun; this deity also presided over the arts and sciences of antiquity. The Moon represented the Goddess Diana, the sister of Apollo; she was the nocturnal luminary, or light of the second order. Mars presided over the battles, and was styled the God of Heroes and Patriots. Mercury, the interpreter of Divine Light, was also the patron deity of Eloquence and Virtue. Jupiter was chief among the Gods, and the personification of divine intelligence and power. Venus, the Goddess of Be auty, and the Mother of Love, are names which the genius of Greece and Rome have transmitted imperishably, in a language which will be preserved by the polished and the educated of mankind through all time.

The Flaming Star is a symbol of Divine Providence, of that great and good Being whom Masons adore as the Sublime Architect of the Universe. The teachings of this degree, my brother, are of the highest antiquity. There was in the ancient city of Hipparenum, a celebrated school, worthy of the concentration of all human virtues, forming Chapters, which heaven designed to become the instructors of the world. But it was particularly in Media that the Magi celebrated their mysteries and doctrines, which spread through the world those floods of light and truth which T.S.A.O.T.U. had placed in the hearts of the learned Hiero- phants of Egypt. Plato attributes to the word Magi a mystic meaning, which signifies “the most perfect culture of all things.” The principle object of this degree is to render man perfect, and to draw him nearer to the Divinity, from whom he emanated; that is to say, his re-habilitation and re-integration in his primitive rights and rank. There is within us two na tures, the animal and the angel, and our labour is to combat the one that the other may denominate, until that moment, when disengaged of its heavy envelope, it shall take flight to better and higher regions. It is perhaps in this sense that the universal dogma of the redemp- tion of mankind should be explained. In the mysteries of this degree it was said that when man, by a new and exemplary life, and by useful work, has reinstated himself in his primitive dignity, he approaches his Creator, is animated by a Divine breath and is initiated. In the instruction, the occult sciences are taught; the secrets of this grade can only be acquired after the prescribed studies, and severe trials, which are in reality but a course of religious and moral ideas, divested of all super- stition.

In the Spring of every year a festival was celebrated termed “the regeneration of Light,” to represent the primitive equality and connection of mankind. Kings exchanged their vain pomp, and freely mingled with the humblest of their subjects, who were seated at the same table with their kings and princes, a custom calculated to imprint a salutary lesson on the minds of the young princes. Theses doctrines, adopted long before by the Chaldeans, were perfected in Persia by the sage King Darius Hystaspes, who, having penetrated into most of the regions of India, found the Gymnosophists in the solitary forests, where deep tran- quility favoured their profound labours. It was from them he learned the laws which govern the Universe, and the journey of the stars. They revealed to him their Sacred Rites, which he recognised as identical with the doctrine of the Magi. During several centuries these were transmitted to posterity through their descendants; and from time to time men of vast and profound genius, in penetrating the sanctuary of science, have dissipated the clouds which hid the truth from the eyes of the profane, and taught them how, by the force of perseverance, they might raise temples to vi rtue, and dig graves for vice. HI!"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 50 T HE H ERMETIC C ROSS . I WILL NOW , illustrious Knight Hermetic Philosopher, explain to you the Hermetic Cross. The Cross represents the tree of science, and mystically corresponds with the secret teachings of the high mysteries, and contains all the sacred numbers: it is the base of Geometry. This symbol existed in the Isle of Cazu- mel and on the coast of Yucatan, nearly four thousand years before Christ; and was revered as the divinity of rain, allegorical of fertility. Quetzalcoatl, the legislator of the Indians, was represented in a robe with crosses. It was used anciently to indicate the roads. It was consecrated in China to the adoration of the Sublime Architect of the Universe. The Priests of Mythras made the sign of the T Cross upon the forehead of the initiates, and a similar sign prevails among the Indian Brahmins in touching the five points of the face. Nature often adopts the cruciform in its mysterious operations. In Northern Asia, and in some parts of America have been found large stones in the form of a Cross, adored by the ancient people. Many mythological ruins in Greece have had the same form. In Egypt the Thos (land-marks), were often in wood, and in the shape of a Cross. On the transverse pieces were inscrip- tions relative to science and the arts; and to multiply those inscriptions, they sometimes placed two or three cross-pieces which made double or triple Crosses, which are frequently seen on ancient monuments, as well as single crosses; again it is considered as the key of the Nile, to which river that country owes its fertility. We have seen how general was the venera- tion for this sign, with different motives. It is to be remarked, with as much pleasure as interest, how natural good sense knew, when science was but little advanced, how to represent by so simple a sign as two sticks laid across at right angles, the course of the sun and the progress of the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"S ENATE ( 12 °- 17 °) 51 seasons. It is not astonishing that to fix better the attention of the people on those great phenomena to which we owe the productions of the earth, and to excite them to a pious grati- tude towards their author, this representative sign was made a religious symbol. The Red Cross is the symbol of the life to come; the origin of this Cross is of the highest antiquity. The horizontal line repre- sents the Equator, and the vertical, the Meridian; we have thus four extremities of the Equator, and the two solstices of Summer and Winter at those of the meridian; consequently, the four seasons. By analogy, they unite to Spring, youth and morning; to Summer, ripe age and noon; to Autumn, age and evening; and to Winter, death and night. The Alchymists added to those four points, which they called the four generative elements, Fire, Air, Earth and Water, which they expressed by conventional signs. They constructed a diagram of a circle enclosing a square, within which was a triangle containing a point from which proceeded two lines, and inscribed it thus:—From the first great cause sprang two contraries, from these the three principles, and the four elements, which are resolvable into the quintessence; so that as all things arise from one fixed thing, all matter is reduceable to the dual male and female principle, symbolically termed the sun and moon. To form our cross commence by tracing a circle of three hundred and sixty degrees, in which design a cross of twelve equal squares, which represent the twelve signs of the Zodiac, or the twelve months of the solar year; one-half, in ascending from January to the end of June, indicates the progression of the days; and the other half, July to the end of December, the declination of the sun. This cr oss essentially marks the line of the meridian from South to North, and indicates at the same time the strong heat of Summer, in opposition to the frosts of Winter. A horizontal line traverses the entire world from East to"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 52 West and shows us equal days and nights in the zone which it divides; this line is called the Equator. In casting the eye of imagination over the four quarters of the globe we discover in this cross the principle of life, which is the Air, or the East, the beginning of vegetation, or Spring, which announces to us the awakening of Nature; infancy should be placed on this side, for man finds himself in the Spring of life, as the horizon of morning indicates the appear- ance of day in this quarter of the world, and the sun rising in the East enriches it with its beneficient rays. Let us now look to the top of the cross; we shall find there fire, which is the soul of life, according to many philosophers, who symbolised by this element the Creator of the Universe. The Summer, by its great heat, characterizes the second part of the year. Man, in adult age, is distinguished by the desire of reproduction of his kind, and by the strength of his physical faculties.—Noon is naturally foun d in this part of the cross, because the sun is at its highest point, which makes the meridian. If we look at the West, we shall find that that part of the world contains more atmospheri c humidity. Autumn, which is the third season of the year, shows us that all the productions of the earth have arrived at their maturity. Man, in this division of the cross, is placed in hi s decline, which we denominate age—third period of life—that in which he should live happy, if he has known how to profit by the preceding years of his labour. This division of the cross indicat es also that the sun descends under the horizon of night in the West; it is the time when man prepares himself for rest. In the North is found the earth, as being the most material, and consequently the heaviest portion; it is also the reason why we place it at the bottom. Winter, when all is frozen from its distance from the sun, produces the fourth season of the year, when all nature seems to be completely inert. The portion of the globe to the North is found to be less peopled than the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"S ENATE ( 12 °- 17 °) 53 other portions of the earth, because it is an almost continual winter. In this part of the cross is indicated the death to which each creature is obliged to submit. Man, as well as animals, return s to the ground; all of matter is decomposed to be reproduced under other forms, and is annihilated by turns, according to the order of Divinity and Nature. In the bottom of the cross, is the instant of sleep or night; which makes the fourth part of the day, composed of twenty-four hours. In the centre of the cross is found the Flaming Star, with a Delta in the middle bearing in its centre, the simple, but great character of U NUS D EUS , O NE G OD !—the point signifying the Universe, which is governed by invariable rules. The laws are indicated by twelve squares, which bear the names of the months, composing the Solar Year. Outside of this cross there is another, announcing the lunar months of twenty-eight days. two hours, seventeen minutes and thirty-six seconds, which the Mahomedans still follow; their year is therefore composed of thirteen lunar months, which gives the same number of days as those of the solar year, which is three hundred. and sixty-five days, forty-eight minutes and forty- eight seconds. The Lunar Cross is called the Hammer Cross. Alchemy was a branch of learning cultivated by the Egyptian priests and the reduction of the golden calf to powder by Moses is instanced by the Adapts as evidence of his ability in their science, the study of which was general in the East and carried thence by the Arabs to Spain and spread by the Templars. The brotherhood adopted it symbolical language of its own in order to conceal its secrets under a Ceremonial Rite and binding oath, such as was common amongst the learned at the time, and also to protect the professors from persecution as sorcerers. In Germany a legend was propagated that the order derived its principles from Christian Rosencreutz who was born in 1387 and travelled to the East. The doctrine of the order was estab- lished on three principles: first, the perfectionment of man that"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 54 he may approach the divinity by his virtues; second, the study of the occult virtues of science; third, the study of the secrets of nature, mystic theology, the sacred names of God, of angels, the elements, the seven planets known to the ancients. Their emblems were the sun, moon, double triangles, the rose. As we have already given you in our ceremonials an outline of the hermetic philosophy, you are now prepared to extend your enquiries into the three worlds termed by them the elementary, intellectual and angelic, whic h correspond in some measure with the three series into which our Rite is divided in the grades of Chapter, Senate and Council. n "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"55 M ASONRY AND THE C RUSADES . F ROM THE E RA of the Crusades may be traced the advent into Europe of Eastern Philosophy and other branches of knowledge, which largely contributed to introduce into society order and improvement. Few expeditions are more extraordinary than those under- taken by the Crusaders for the recovery of Jerusalem from the Turks. The name of Crusader or Croisés, is derived from the cross which they wore on their persons, in gold, silk, or cloth. In the first Crusade all were red; in the third, the French alone preserved that colour. Green crosses were adopted by the Flemings, and white by the Englis h. Each company, likewise, bore a standard, on which was a cross. When Omar, the successor of Mahomet, conquered Syria and Palestine, Jerusalem was rega rded as an Holy City, and was by him embellished with a magnificent Mosque, built of marble, its interior being adorned with an immense number of lamps of gold and of silver. During the Eleventh Century Pilgrims to the Holy Sepulchre visited Jerusalem in great numbers, and received a partial protection from the Caliphs, because they derived a revenue from them. But a new and ferocious race, the Sel- jouks, or Turks, conquered the Arabians in the year 1055 , and embraced Mahommedanism; they oppressed the Pilgrims, and heaped such brutal treatment upon them that it excited a general feeling of horror. A pilgrim named Coucoupetre, a native of Amiens, in Picardy, who is known to moderns as Peter the Hermit, was so incensed at the cruelties of the Turks, and related them so vividly to Pope Urban the Second, to whom he brought letters from the Patriarch of Jerusalem, that Urban exhorted the Christian warriors to take arms against the Mussulmans, at a Council held at Placentia, on the 1 st of March, 1095 , which was"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 56 attended by 200 bishops, 4 , 000 of the clergy, and 30 , 000 laity. Peter meanwhile, was earnestly preaching war against the Turks in every part of France. Pope Urban summoned a second Council to meet him at Clermont, the capital of Auvergne, on the 18 th day of November, 1095 , to deliberate on the affairs of the East; this was the most important event ever witnessed by the Western Church. It was attended by 14 Archbishops, 225 Bishops, 90 Abbots, several thousand Knights, and a multitude of people; this council lasted seven days. Peter the Hermit excited his hearers to frenzy, by his relation of the atrocities of the Turks, and the horrible sufferings of the Christians, advised them to take the road to Jerusalem, and assured them of imperishable gl ory in the Kingdom of Heaven. The whole assembly, as if moved by inspiration, exclaimed with one voice: “It is the will of God.” Three great armies marched for the Holy City, led by Peter the Hermit, Walter the Moneyless, Godfrey de Bouillon, Duke of Normandy, Hognes, Count of Vermandois (brother to Philip the First of France), Raymond Dupuy, and other renowned warriors. They defeated the troops of Sultan Solyman, in two pitched battles, captured Nice and Antioch, and arriving at Jerusalem, laid siege to that city, which, after forty days, was captured by storm, and the warriors of the Cross walked with naked feet in solemn procession to the Holy Sepulchre, where they gave thanks for so great a victory. This occurred on the 5 th day of July, 1099 . The Second Crusade was undertaken in 1147 , armed with the authority of Pope Eugene the Third; its principal leaders were Conrad the Third, Empero r of Germany, and Louis the Seventh of France, who met with such reverses, that King Louis returned to France in July, 1149 , overwhelmed with grief for the loss of so many brave warriors of Gaul, who had left their bones to whiten on the Plains of Syria.

The great Barons. of England, France, and Aquitaine, atten- ded a Conference near Gisors, when Richard Coeur de Lion received from the Archbishop of Tyre, the White Cross, and Philip Augustus, King of Fran ce, the Red Cross; they, with Frederick Barbarossa, resolved to retrieve the honour of the Christian arms. They were reinfo rced by the fleets of Genoa, Venice, and Pisa, and with the hardy warriors of Flanders and Denmark. The Hosts of Richard and Augustus captured the City of Acre, and the Turks were compelled to pay a fee of 200 , 000 pieces of gold, to release 100 nobles and 1 , 500 inferior captives, and to restore the wood of the true cross. In consequence of a delay in the execution of the treaty, 3 , 000 Turks were beheaded almost in sight of Saladin, by the orders of King Richard. Ascalon fell into the hands of the Crusaders, after the memorable battle of that name, in which 40 , 000 Saracens perished., and a truce was established for the space of three years, three months, three weeks, three days, and three hours, during which pilgrims we re permitted to visit Jerusalem unmolested.

De Montfort is better known for his role in the so-called Albigensian crusade, a genocide campaign against an unortho- dox religious group in the South of Fran ce, during which he was killed. The crusade of 1207 mentioned in the text seems to have been an expedition of such little consequence as to have been generally left out of the count. Some historians reckons the Sixth Crusade as an expedition which began in 1227 and which Emperor Frederick II took command of the next year (being excommunicated by the Pope for turning up late). Without any major battles, Frederick managed in 1229 to negotiate a settlement which restored Jerusalem to the Christian kingdom (t he Muslims retaining control of the Temple area and the major mosques) and guaranteed access for pilgrims. In 1244 , with the kingdom of Jerusalem weakened by civil war, the city was captured by an alliance of Turks and Egpyptians. As stated in the text, the two crusades led by Louis IX were of no long- term effect and never set foot in Palestine. In 1291 Acre, the last Crusader stronghold on the mainland, fell to the Saracens, ending the Crusades. Ref.: Ency. Brit .

The establishment of the Knights Templars, and Knights Hospitallers, owe their foundation entirely to the French; the Orders were instituted by Raymond Dupuy, a native of Dau- phiny, (the first Grand Master,) Hughes de Payens, Godfrey de Bouillon, and other Knights and Monks, who consecrated themselves to the service of the sick and wounded, in the year 1118 . Shortly after the foundation of the Order, Baldwin, after- wards King of Jerusalem, conferre d on them a house, said to be situated on the site of King Solomon’s Temple; hence they derived their name of Knights of the Temple or Templars. During the Crusades, from 1095 until 1270 , a period of one hundred and seventy-five years, the Order of the Templars increased rapidly in numbers, we alth, and power, and they were renowned for their indomitable prowess against the enemies of Christendom. The war with the Saracens was fiercely contes- ted, and these Knights often penetrated far into the country, away from any support and exposed to constant peril, fre- quently sought and obtained aid from the Coptic Priests, whom the oppressions and persecutions of the Saracens, their con- querors, compelled to live retired and worship in secret. Time flowed on; the wars of the Crusades were long, toilsome, and bloody. The Knights became more intimately connected with the Coptic Priests, and by them were initiated into the Doctrines and “Mysteries” practiced by “The Widow’s Children,” and introduced to a knowledge of T.S.A.O.T.U., as taught by the ancient Egyptian Priests, who served “one living God, Creator of light and darkness.” The Knights thus admitted and initiated into the Mysteries of Antiquity, upon their return to Europe, communicated the Sciences, Doctrines, and Legends of the Orientals to their companion Knights, who, grateful for the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 60 knowledge thus vouchsafed to them, devoted themselves zealously to the propagation of the principles of the Antient and Primitive Rite. Grateful for their admission to the Mystic Temple, they petitioned Pope Eugene the Second to confirm the privileges of the Order, and allow them to retain, specially, the title of Knight Templars; and this Pontiff, believing the denomination only had reference to the Temple of Jerusalem, granted their request; and from this period they have been known as Knight Templars, or Knights of Kadosh, holy and purified. It is related in the Legend of the Swedish Rite, that eighty- one “Children of the Widow,” travelling in Europe, A . D . 1150 , under the guidance of Garimont, Patriarch of Jerusalem, visited the Bishop of Upsfal, who gave them a most cordial welcome. The Knights initiated him, into the confraternity, and confided to him the documents and archives of our laws, and the ritual of our Mystic Rite. By him the priceless relics were preserved. The Knights of the Temple received from the bishop the depo- sit formerly confided to him; and by this means the Templars became the conservators of the Mysterious Rites and Cere- monies, brought from the East by the Free-Masons—Priests of the True Light. Thus the initiated would fraternise with other similar associations, while preserving their own distinctive forms. It admits of proof that the Ancient Templars were often initiated by the Symbolical Masons, as well by the Hermetic Brotherhoods, who descended from the Hierophants of Egypt. The Knight Templars entirely devoted to the sciences and doctrines brought from the country of Thebes, were anxious to commemorate and perpetuate this introduction to the end of time. The Scotch Masons established three grades of St. Andrew and adopted the allegorical legends of the Templars. The Legend of this Degree relates that “The Scottish Knights had commenced to excavate a large plot of land in Jerusalem, for the purpose of erecting a Temple, near the site of the ancient edifice built by King Solomon, and over the place of"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 61 the Sanctum Sanctorum. In the course of their labours they came upon three large stones, which appeared to have formed a portion of the foundation of the first temple; their monumental form invited a closer examination, which was amply repaid by the discovery of the sacred name , within the ovals traced upon the last one. This was also the type of the Mysteries of the Templars, the Holy Word lost when H. A. was assassinated as related in the Symbolical Degrees. This word the Knights preserved on the foundation stones of the Temple.” The works commenced on St. Andrew’s Day, and thus originated the general title of Knights of St. Andrew, and the Degrees of Apprentice, F. Craft, and Master, worked under the title of Petit Architect, Grand Architect, and Scottish Master; for as the Knights in obedience to their vows were compelled to make pilgrimages and journeys into fore ign and distant countries, it is claimed that they established thes e grades as a means of mutual recognition and assistance. Besides the war in Asia against the Saracens, the Templars were engaged in a long and arduous struggle against “The Old Man of the Mountain,” descended from the family of the Arsacidæ, and whose rule extended over about a dozen large cities besides Tyre. This prince was the High Priest of a religion which some persons pretended to recognise as the ancient one of Egypt; he, by the prestige of his power and genius, reduced his Neophytes to a state of blind and implicit obedience; and young people imbrued with his doctrines astonished the world by their courage and devotion. Eventually, however, the Knight Templars attached the domains of the Old Man of the Mountain to their own by right of conquest, and, remembering the fidelity and bravery of his disciples, admitted them into their own order; and some maintain that the Templars even adopted a portion or their peculiar tenets. The Grand Master of the Templars distinguished himself by his exploits against the Saracens, accumulated vast riches, and by his virtues and bravery acquired a reputation which awa-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 62 kened the envy and aroused the jealousy of the princes of Europe, and finally led to the dissolution of the order, which at the time of this deplorable event, numbered more than 40 , 000 Knights and possessed 9 , 000 princely estates. The light which they had brought from the East and diffused over Europe quickened the venom of fanaticism and fear in the reigning despots, and finally they succumbed to these tyrannical powers. About this time that celebrated Rosicrucian Mission- ary, Raymond Lully, attempted to amalgamate the Templars with the Knights of Malta and other orders, but the union was refused by the G. M. of the Templars, Brother Jacques de Molay. Pope Clement the Fifth, and Phil ip Le Bel, King of France, finding the already great power of the Templars was increasing daily; and entertaining a natural dread of doctrines and mysteries which nullified their absolutism, made so many experts in civil liberty and was inculcating the propriety of indi- vidual judgment against the unintelligent obedience exacted by church and state, entered into a conspiracy for their destruc- tion, from which they hoped to gain a threefold advantage, namely, obtain possession of their immense wealth, perpetuate fanaticism and protect imposture. It is said that Bertrand de Goth cou1d only obtain the triple crown, by consenting to the extermination of the Templars; and contemporary history paints this Prelate in the most repulsive colours. The manner of the attack upon the Templars commenced in the following manner: The Prior of the Templars at Mont- faucon had been condemned to imprisonment by the Grand Master, for heresy and immorality, and he was thrown into a dungeon with another prisoner, Noffo Dei, a Florentine Templar, who had apostatized from the Order; they agreed to obtain their deliverance by denouncing the Templars, and sent word to the king that they had a revelation to make which would be more useful to him than the acquisition of a kingdom."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 63 Philip, overjoyed at this circumst ance, eagerly made use of it for the destruction of the Order. The apostates concocted an address to Enguerrand de Marigny, the Minister of Finance, and following up this first accusation, placed in the king’s hands the denunciation he had himself dictated, and which contained the most infamous charges, the falsity and grossness of which have been exposed by contemporary historians. The Emperor Frederick II., grandson of Frederick Barbarossa, after his return from Syria, A . D . 1230 , opposed with all his might the excesses and abuses of the Ecclesiastical power, and parti- cularly that of Gregory the Ninth, by whom he had been excommunicated, previous to his departure for Palestine; and indeed it was owing to this Po ntiff’s intriguing and tampering with the fidelity of Frederick’s arm, that the object of the war was not obtained. Frederick, in revenge, upon his return to Europe, besieged the Pope in Rome, ravaged the adjacent provinces, and then concluded a peace, which the deadly animosity of the Holy Father prevented from being of long continuance; for the Prelate, bitterly galled, and with pride touched to the core at seeing his Apostolic thunderbolts only amuse and excite Frederick to attack, and oppose the abuses of the clergy, by satires and lampoons, which he caused to be published in Germany, France, and Italy, died of grief and baffled malice. There are many legends current in regard to the great Emperor Frederick Barbarossa; one is that he still lives spellbound, in a cave, in one of the German mountains, to be revived when the ravens cease to fly around the mountain’s summit, and each century Frederick awakes, exclaiming, “Is it time?” Now, the accusation that we have spoken of against the Knight Templars, was founded on a report of deeds alleged to have occurred eighty years before; and the history of the time, instead of supporting the charge, shows how despotism, fanaticism and avarice, can distort facts and make them subser- vient to their Machiavellian policy. Pope Clement, Philip and"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 64 the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, an order better known as Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, each gave publicity to this accusation, with such comments and colouring as suited their individual views. Jacques de Molay, Grand Master of the Templars, was at this time in Cyprus, where the General Convocation of the Knights was usually held, but yielding to the solicitations and advice of Clement, he travelled to Paris, where he had no sooner arrived than he was arrested and thrown into the Bastile, by order of Philip, who in one day, October 13 th, 1307 , had caused every French Knight Templar to be cast into prison. At the king’s instigation, proceedings were immediately commenced, and the prosecution entrusted to the violent and vindictive William of Nogaret, and Father Imbert, a Dominican Monk, a Member of the Inquisition; it being deemed expedient to make heresy a principal feature in the charges. Following out the conspiracy, and in accordance with their secret understanding, the Pope pretended to be highly incensed against Philip, and wrote several angry letters, “demanding to know the authors of such accusations; that he believed the Grand Master of the Templars innocent, and that persecutions commenced against an Order so rich and powerful, had their origin in jealousy; that in fact , they were Military Priests, existing only by Papal authority, and were, as a Religious Order, only amenable to Rome.” After much simulated opposition, Philip acknowledged this priestly right, and as a reward for his filial submission, was delegated as the agent to bring the Templars to justice, and was comforted and strengthened by a Papal Bull, published expressly fo r that effect. “Our dearly beloved son, Philip Le Bel,” it commenced, “has not caused the arrest of the Knight Templars by any greed of wealth, but by a veritable zeal for religion; and is far from intending to appropriate any of their possessions.” Clement sent legates to Paris, and came himself to France, to judge these already condemned victims of cupidity and fraud."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 65 It must be remembered, that in the Thirteenth and Four- teenth Centuries, scarcely any in France, except the clergy, could read or write, and since the decadence of the Empire, ignorance had spread her foul veil over the whole of Europe. With a knowledge of such all- pervading ignorance, we cannot be astonished at the influence of the church party, nor at the colossal power acquired by the Priesthood. At the commencement of the proceedings, Jacques de Molay, and three of the first dignitaries of the Order, were arraigned before Clement the Fifth, at Poictiers, and he confi- ded the prosecution to two Cardinals, the Archbishop of Sens and some other Prelates. One of the first questions put to De Molay was, “Have you no writing to produce in defenc e of your community?” to which he replied, “Documents and evid ence could be obtained, that his greatest earthly ambition was to make the innocence of his people apparent; but, that he was a knight whose learning was his least boast, and he therefore prayed for a council or a clerk to assist him in his work.” As the trial was but a mockery, not public, and the heresy of the Order being a foregone conclu- sion, he was refused either counsellor or advocate, and thus, little stood in the way to prevent this sacrifice of principle to expediency. It has been said th at in our own day extortion, violence and bribery have sometimes been enlisted to oppose the march of justice; and that the excesses, dissipations and malignancy of Philip, are not without modern parallels. It is also asserted that the premature death of Philip alone saved France from the abyss into which his conduct was forcing her. No class of society, no institutio n was safe from his persecution and extortion, and a general revolt was fast becoming imminent, when he died. Still, there was one exception. The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem lent its entire influence to the king, in order to increase their own wealth and power, and this is the reason that the Grand Master of St. John appears so conspicuously in the destruction of the Templars, whose"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 66 possessions were afterwards divided between the Order of Malta and Philip. The Templars struggled vainly against the regal and papal power, and Clement, without loss of time, assembled a general council, composed of more than three hundred priests, in Dauphiny. This, council, hesitating upon the “Proposition to suppress the Order of Knight Templars,” objected that it would be contrary to 1aw and justice to do so without hearing them freely in their defence, and confronting them openly with their accusers, which was what the Knights petitioned. Clement V., who assisted in person at this council, exasperated at this most unexpected opposition to his will, with much excitement exclaimed: “If the absence of a trifling formality prevents the Council from passing judgment on the accused, we will our- selves do it in the plentitude of our pontifical power.” Disappointed in the action of the Council, the holy father summoned a secret Consistory, composed of cardinals and bishops, who were convinced by the strength of his private arguments of the necessity at the suppression of the Order of Knight Templars. The sentence says: “The Knights not having been convicted in strict form of law, but condemned by the Pope, in virtue of his Apostolic authority, the holy father would himself be answerable for the custody of their persons and the proper disposition of their wealth.” During the four years that this sacrilegious persecution lasted, many of the Knights were subjected to the most excruciating tortures for the purpose of extorting confessions which would aid in condemning the society, but few failed to maintain their innocence; to those, who on the rack were weak enough. to acknowledge the charges, life was granted, and a pension allowed. To those of stronger nerve, though not greater innocence, who persis ted in the purity of the institution, the Infernal “Que stion” was again applied, and many of the Knights who wo uld have courted death and suffering in honorable warfare, quailed at the sight of the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 67 horrible apparatus for inducing an avowal of guilt; and with quivering nerves and maddening brain acknowledged deeds they had neither dreamt nor heard of until mentioned in the confessions they signed; for be it remembered, that even in the accusations, the special crimes charged were not named to the prisoners, and yet in spite of all that cruelty could invent, or malignity inflict, the constancy of a greater part or these martyrs remained unshaken. Even those whose firmness had given way under their agonies, retracted their confessions at the approach of death, and in sincere repentance declared the allegations untrue and extorted from them .under the excruciating tortures of the rack. The reverend fathers, bishops, instruments of St. Peter and of King Philip Le Bel, decided, in a Provincial Grand Council, that those Templars who “falsified their confessions” should be treated as recusants. A few days after this decision, according to the barbarous jurisprudence of the time, fifty-nine of these gentlemen were condemned and burnt. The Bishop of Ledéve describes these unfortunates as they appeared in their last moments: “Their eyes fixed towards heaven, as if imploring from above the strength to support the agony of the flames which 1icked their limbs and encircled their bodies, they repudiated the crimes attributed to them, and prayed for firmness to maintain the truth and innocence of themselves and brothers.” Notwithstanding the unanimity of their state- ments—a glorious proof of the falseness of the accusations— Philip, Clement, and the Grand Master of Malta, confirmed the decree against the Templars; condemned Jacques de Molay to the flames, and according to many historians, confiscated the property of six thousand Knights in one day. Jacques de Molay, as he approached the pile, and was about to assume the crown of martyrdom, harangued the populace and predicted the day and hour of the death of Philip and Clement. He cited those, his. implacable enemies, accusers and judges, to meet him before the tribunal of God, in a year and a"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 68 day from that time, and then and there to render an account of their judgement. De Molay was executed March 11 th, 1314 , 1 and the finger of the Great Eternal, as in the day of the impious King of Babylon, pointed in answ er to the appeal of the Grand Master. Clement and Philip both died before the end of April, 1314 , 2 and as history is silent as to the manner of their death, the enemies or the Knights Templars have endeavoured to make it appear that they were poiso ned by the surviving members. The day following the death of Molay, Sir Knight of Aumont and seven other Templars, gathered the ashes of the pile, as is related by the brothers Suedois. Fifteen days only elapsed when the apostate Knight, Squin de Florian, was assassinated. The Pope beatified him, and caused hi m to be interred at Avignon. The Templars found means to remove the body and deposited the ashes of De Molay in its place. During his life this worthy Grand Master had established fo ur Grand Temples in Europe— North, South, East an d West, to wit: Stockholm, Paris, Naples and Edinburgh. Bocace, the Bishop of Lodeve, Bertot, and a host of contemporary and succeeding writers have spoken highly of the heroic virtues of these martyrs to truth, honor and innocence. Each and everyone was steadfast to keep his obliga- tion. No Iscariot, even under the torture, developed the Mysteries or betrayed the Doctrine they had brought from the East. May we always show the same fidelity. After the disasters just related, many of the Knights quitted their native land, and by their escape and concealment, were enabled to preserve our institutions and rites, and maintain the purity of our ancient Doctrines and Tenets of which we are so justly proud. 1 [The date is given by more modern sources as 18 th or 19 th March.] 2 [According to the Encyclopædia Britannica ( ed. cit .), Clement V died 20 th April 1314 and Phillip IV on 29 th November of the same year.] HI!

If, now guided by the observations he has made, he su bmits to the investigation of the objects which surround him; if, overrunning the chain of beings, from cold and inert matter, he passes to man, master- piece of the new creation, studying successively the innumer- able transformations, by the aid of which informal clay is metamorphosised into imperfect vegetables, and from thence in an ascendant march to the most accomplished animal organisation; then necessarily a vast and profound thought illuminates his spirit, and unveils to him, so to say, the secrets of T.S.A.O.T.U.; he will be co mpelled to ask himself if the divine breath which animates him has not, like the impure vase, which grows superb and odor iferous flowers, submissive to the progressive march of beings , undergone all possible trans- formations before elevation to the degree of perfection which characterises himself?

In effect, let us ascend time, transport ourselves in thought even to the cradle of ages and follow, step by step, the progres- sive march of humanity. If the perfection of the vital breath which animates us is the indirect reason of civilization, are we not involuntarily, almost unknow n to ourselves, coming to a conclusion that the soul’s imperfect glimmerings are imperfect emanations of the divine breath, which in proportion as it passes from one informal being to another more perfect, is by degrees refined, and tending imperc eptibly to draw to itself the beings which infinite wisdom has formed. The unclean insect, object of our aversion, inherited until it succumbed an imper- fect breath which it exhaled from a being of a superior order: and it is thus, that from one transmigration to another, the soul, after successively identifying itself with all the series of beings, ascends towards its author, to repose in the bosom of the God which formed it. In this consisted the veneration of the Egyptians for animal life, they saw God in all forms. The Indian Vedas teach that “the wise men give many names to the being who is one;” and that—“As the web issues from the spider, as little sparks proceed from fire, so from the one soul proceed all breathing animals, all worlds, all gods.” The Essen- ian philosophers held that pure ether, which was attracted into matter by the secret operations of nature, was enclosed as in a prison, until the dissolution of the constituent atoms which formed such prison, setting free that ether which was the soul, it returned to heaven and rejoic ed once more in its innocent but individual liberty. The history of the tendencies of the human spirit in different ages shows us immense generations of the children of Eve, by timid and slow steps, hazarding the proofs of life, gradually strengthening their steps, spreading in intelligence and rising, in fine, to the highest point of perfection. It was not done, it is true, without having terrible obstacles to surmount, without"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 71 having to wander, without having often deviated from the aim whither their efforts tended, without having succumbed, even under the burden which they had imposed upon themselves: but what imports it? they were elevated. The truth, pure and brilliant as a star of the firmament, has spread lurid rays of light upon the horizon of the world; men have seen it, found it beautiful, and are becoming more strong and more courageous by the attainment. Proud of its high and glorious destiny humanity advances, as it traver ses the ages, freeing itself at each step of a prestige, letting fall a shred of the veil of iniquity which covered its humiliated forehead under the weight of the infirmities of its imperfect nature. The intellectual life of the people, as well as their political existence, has had its progressive developments, its epochs of conception and childhood, its periods of transition and glory. Men of great and profound spirit, geniuses whom we encounter, from age to age, who have inspired the purest breath of divine inspiration, these have penetrated the sanctuary of science and have arrived at the discovery of the mysteries which the All- Powerful accorded them. They have dispersed the clouds which veil truth from the eyes of the profane, and they have taught, as well as they could, with the strength of perseverance, to raise temples to virtue and dig dungeons for vice. Thus, to what they saw in the revered temples of superb Memphis, the mysterious followers of Isis added the basis of the first wisdom, and raised themselves to the most hardy theosophic concep- tions—a spiritual theology surviving centuries. Ancient Greece, in its time ambitious of glory and desirous of learning, demanded from the aged Copts the secrets of their sciences and virtues; but more greedy of honours than of aspiring to the light, it opened its schools but to see the plaudits and crowning of the pretended Sages of frivolous Greece, amorous of pleasures and of fetes. One by the force of his genius raised himself to a knowledge of our sublime doctrines, and it is to the living penetration of his spirit, that the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 72 Athenians owed the idea of a Temple to the Unknown God. Freemasonry is then a scientific institution of charity and love. Amongst the virtues which it teaches, one ought to place in the first rank the abnegation of oneself and devotion to the general good. This sublime order which remounts, as we see, to the highest antiquity, has but a single aim and works but to accom- plish a single mission. This aim, this mission, is the study of wisdom, which serves for the discernment of truth; it is the beneficent work or the development of reason and intelligence; it is the culture of the qualities of the human heart and the repression of its vices. The degrees to which you have already been admitted indicate to you the philosophical studies which expanded the minds of those who came in contact with the Eastern sects, which originated in the mysteries of antiquity and from which by direct descent we derive our principles. In collecting what remains of the Ancient Mysteries, their monuments, and the descriptions which the poets have given to us, one may judge how they spread amongst all civilised nations. The aspirant found in their caves pits of a frightful depth, which he descended by means of supports for the feet; he overran long and tortuous sub terraneans where he encountered spectres under hideous forms, monsters to combat, torrents to ford, braziers to traverse. Everything which could affright his imagination was put into requis ition, and death seemed to present itself to him under many forms. Lugubrious and plain- tive cries were heard in the dis tance, and the rapid movements of the lights plunged him all at once in fearful darkness. The noisy play of machinery was heard; he was pained by the blowing of wind, claps, of thunder, and the impetuosity of the torrents. At the least indication of weakness or fear he was thrown into a dungeon for the remainder of his days: the initiates believing that timid and lax men were incapable of guarding inviolably the secrets of their mysteries, and they retained the failing Aspirant in order that he might not reveal"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 73 what he had seen in the prelim inary preparations and in the trials by earth, air, fire and water. The fortunate Aspirant was conducted into a place embellished by all that art could add to nature; a sweet and tender light rendered the objects more interesting; the air was perfumed by the agreeable scent of flowers; and the melodious sounds of instruments announced to the initiates their joy at seeing him come out conqueror from the evil genies of the elements. This place was the emblem of the Elysian happiness which man would experience when he had surmounted the obstacles be fore arriving at truth and virtue. There still remained on e proof, less frightful, but de- manding still more constancy, it was a rigorous silence, fastings and austerities, augmented from day to day, during which they prepared him by instruction for the revelation of the mysteries. This instruction was proportioned to his light, the greater part being veiled under symbols and hieroglyphics, questioning him upon matter which prepared him to pierce the veil. Thus prepared they revealed to him the most important part of the mysteries. They taught him the existence of a supreme intel- ligence, first cause of all being; they informed him that a thick veil concealed the grandeur of the light, that its immensity could not be represented by any sign, that the different symbols which they offered to the profane were but emblems of his least known attributes. They announced to him also the existence of another being, enemy of the first, but less powerful, the agent of crimes and all evils. They taught him that there is in man a substance, simple, active, essentially different from matter, which, more agile than air, more prompt than sight, glanced even to the extremities of the universe, sounded the abyss, developed its secrets, reviewed the past, and dared even to advance to the future; they taught him that he could only raise himself by virtue and degrade himself by vice; they traced out to him the duties which he had to fulfil towards the Author of nature, mankind itself, and those which he contracted in the quality of initiation; they rendered him a reason for abstaining"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 74 from certain animals and vegetables; those sullied by crimes had to undergo still mo re severe proofs; it was pretended that they plunged him in a liquid which arrested the action of fire and that they passed him several times through the flames to purify him. After the Initiation he was shown to the people in a procession which was called the “Pomp of Initiation.” This ceremony was made as imposing as possible, in order to show what a glorious thing initiation was, and the initiated, enjoyed the highest consideration and were looked upon as men more pure and instructed than the vulgar, and were promised after death the enjoyment of a more pure felicity—they were chosen to fill the most important places in society. The light of initiation was not confined to signs and tokens and words or even to morality and theology, but it embraced all the sciences. The Priests of each Nome learned particularly one special science; and were the depositories of manuscripts which were all the more precious as they were the only copies existing in the world. One taught how to follow the Stars in their courses, calculate their swiftness, measure their distance, divide the seasons, give a more perfect form to the year by means of intercalations; others, by the principles of Geometry, know- ledge of the laws of movements, and the calculation of resis- tance and friction, taught how to centuple the strength of man, level the earth, raise dykes, dig canals, to construct Saïs, Thebes, Memphis, and above 20 , 000 cities, besides immense edifices of which several yet resist the destructive hand of time; others taught how to purify metals, analyse them, combine then, alloy them, so as to render them more ductile and malle- able; to indicate the properties of vegetables and the means of extracting the sap, so as to prolong the days of man; or better to preserve the body after death from decay during thousands of years, and preserve the freshness of colour and illusion of life. Others taught the principles of that celebrated legislation which sought to ally the general interest to that of the individ- ual, bring together men of primitive quality, simply by their"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 75 wants, and cause them to love virtue. Others presented in chronological order the revolutions and events of nations, continuing the list of Kings according to their names, their actions, virtues, vices, and the judgements which had been passed upon them. The Priests consulted these writings on the death of the reigning King, and these redoubtable judges traversed the lake in a boat guided by Charon and exposed in the presence of the people, all the good and evil which he had done, and threw in the fatal urn, the ballot which rendered his memory cherished or odious. It seems certain from our knowledge of the Egyptian priests and the Essenian sects, that the latter were only the contin- uators of that ancient caste which dispersed itself at the period of those troubles and dissentions which turned Egypt into one scene of anarchy, by which the Romans profited so far as to convert it into one of their provinces. It is reasonable to conclude that the founders of the Essenian Societies were Egyptian priests. What proves this very clearly is that, on the one hand we know not what became of these after the over- throw of the throne of the Ptolemies and the invasion of the country, while on the other hand the societies of the Essenians which appeared at that time, present almost the same character as did the priestly caste of Egypt; indeed we find among the Essenians of Jerusalem and Egypt, the mysterious initiation, the oath of prudence, and the evidences of the Egyptian priests, the same love of the sciences, the same philosophy; everything in fact establishes a perfect resemblance. We may affirm from proofs so intimate, that the confederacy of philosophers, known by the name of initiates or priests of ancient Egypt, reappeared and continued its system in the societies of the Essenes after those later wanderings which followed its dissolution and the dispersion of its members. Contemporary with the Essenes, were the Therapeutæ, a magical, astrological, and alchemical sect, who quietly disappeared, They were succeeded by the Ascetics, that is, by a kind of Jewish monks, who, though"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 76 devoted to a purely contemplative life, preserved amongst them opinions which suffice to prove that they had received from the Egyptian Priests and Essenes that spirit of true philosophy which neither new dogmas or even superstitions had been wholly able to denaturalise. Christianity came and enlarged the: circle of initiation, it extended to all men the benefits and the moral parts of the mysteries, but the scientific part, its grand foundation, it neg- lected, as less essential to its missi on; it left it as noble pasture to the indefatigable study of the curious and the wise. Christian Monks succeed in turn to the Jewish Ascetics and the ruins of the Coptic Monastery are shown, where it is said 360 monks were devoted to seeking, without rest, for the philosophers’ stone. The traditional history of the Templars asserts, that their Grand Master of Nazareth was consecrated Pontiff of the universal religion by the Priests of Egypt. What is historically more important to know is, that the Coptic monks who exist in Egypt, even in the present day, are the immediate successors of the Eg yptian Priests and Essenes. This connecting link having been established so clearly, it is evident that the spirit and ph ilosophy of these Priests and Essenes, are not lost, seeing that these different bodies have been continued by an unbroken succession till the present day. At all times Christianity was far from absorbing the sacred sciences into its bosom, philosophy preserved its independence, whilst making itself Christian. Origen, Justin, Clement of Alex- andria, Hermesius, and many other fathers of the first centuries, are a proof of it. There were even some philosophers who imposed on themselves the task of conciliation and of making the christian dogmas and philosophical teachings of christianity to concur. The Gnostics and Manichees, who lacked not a certain grandeur, essayed the task and were persecuted by the church. Manes from whom these last borrowed their name, was born in the year 277 of the common era. There was at this epoch in Egypt, a man named Scythianus, by birth an Arab,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 77 fully instructed in the secrets of the Magi; he had the knowledge of hieroglyphics, astronomy, mythology, and was a man who practised the soundest morality; he composed four books under the titles of Gospel , Chapters , Mystery , and Treasures . Ferbulio, his disciple, inherited his fortune and his works; he betook himself to Pa lestine and sought to propagate the religion of the Magi; persecuted he went to Persia, where he changed his name and called himself Buddas; persecuted in Persia, he retired to the house of a widow, where he died. This widow having bought a slave, adopted him and gave him the name Cubricus, the young man made great progress in the books of Ferbulla, and, like hi s master’s example changed his name to Manes, which signifie s conversation, and founded the sect of Manichees. Pursued by the hatred of Archelans, Bishop of Cassan, and the Priest Marcellus, he withdrew for shelter to a small mansion named Arabion, upon the river Strenga, but was denounced by another Priest named Triphon, to the King of Persia, who sent seventy-two guards to take him; he was arrested upon the bridge of the Strenga at the moment when about to betake himself to a neighbouring town named Diodoride. The King condemned him to be either roasted or burned alive, the flesh thus parting from the bones. After his death, the number of disciples augmented considerably, and they gained followers of the most elevated intelligence, even St. Augustine. The filiation of the Manichees to the philosophical doctors of antiquity is proved by a fact not generally remarked. The Catholic Church reproached them with believing in two principles and consequently in two Gods; the reproach was unjust because they only followed the instruction of the three grades prescribed in Egypt: first, Dualism, or belief in the two principles; second, Sabaothism, or the adoration of the natural forces; third, Jahoism, or the worship of a sole God, Sovereign of, and independent of, the material world. They therefore only taught dualism as a mode to arrive at the manifestation of the entire truth. Beside the Manichees many other differently"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 78 named sects branched from the original tree or the ancient mysteries and were known under the general name of Gnostics, a word signifying knowledge. Nothing is better authenticated than that the disciples of these sects were in existence in the twelfth century in Italy, France, Germany, and England, as Templars, Lollards, Ghibbelines, and Albigenses. 1 They had secret signs of recognition, professed great purity, and were di- vided into two principal classes, the Disciple and the Perfect Initiate; the latter of which were vowed to chastity, and on the dualistic principle they looked upon the head of the opposing sect as the evil principle person ified, and upon their own as the good principle. The poet Dante belonged in Italy to the Ghibbelines, the poets Chaucer and Gower in England to the Albigenses and the monument of the latter in London repre- sents him as crowned with a wreath of roses and having the cardinal virtues at his feet. The Templars were judicially sup- pressed for being Gnostics and are commemorated in our Rite. 2 Eventually the philosophical sects took the name of Rosi- crucians, and so became Freemasons, of whose history the teaching of our rite is well know to you. 1 [Of these four groups, only two were st rictly speaking religious sects and of those only the Albigenses (Cathars) had any affinity with Gnostic ideas; the Lollards (a derisive term applied by th eir persecutors) were mediæval English proto-Protestants, followers of John Wycliffe ( 1330-1384 ), who were perse- cuted for trying to break the ecclesia stical monopoly on knowledge of the Scriptures. The Ghibbelines were a political faction or party in Italy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, any accusations of heresy against whom stemmed from their support of the Holy Roman Emperor against the Pope at the times when the two were disputing. Likewise the heresy charges agains the Templars were almost ce rtainly fabricated in their entirity by Phillip le Bel and his associates as a means to get their hands on the order’s money.] 2 [But most Gnostics would see in “T.S .A.O.T.U.” only the Demiurge, at best a subordinate deity and at worse a blin d, ignorant or downright malignant spirt.] HI!"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 79 E XTENSION OF M ASONIC P RINCIPLES . I N THE BEGINNING man was born free from sin, pure, having within him a Divine instinct of the noblest virtue, and the most generous inspirations. To do good was a natural impulse. Evil did not, could not exist, for Charity and Love were the sole motors of his actions. He li ved for others more than for himself; his Religion, Politics, and Economy were comprised in the command, “Love one another.” Obedience to this law comprised every duty. In his fellow man he recognized a brother, and freely shared with him the fruits of his vine-yards and the clothing of his flocks. All lived in Peace and Harmony, until families became societies, and societies grew into nations. Then the odious distinction “Mine and Thine” arose, and Avarice and Corruption, like noxious reptiles, began to crawl amongst and infest a happy people with their venom. Avarice and Ambition united and brought forth Pride, Envy, and Hatred; together they attacked the heart of man, and destroyed in it the impulse of good, the seeds of virtue; all remembrance of his celestial origin, and of his sublime destiny. Love and Charity grew weak, and arbitrary power usurping their place, triumphed over the feeble, subjected them to its caprices, and forced them to cultivate the earth by the sweat of their brow, and gathering in the harvest of which the powerfnl seized the fruitful ears, and left scarcely more than the barren straws to the labourer and his little ones. Divisions soon took place among the rulers. Murder depopulated the earth. War spre ad its dreadful banners to the wind, and destruction, pestilence, and famine followed in his train. The furrows overflowed with the blood of those who disputed for possession of the field, whilst the sweet voice of humanity was stifled by infuriate howlings and savage discord. To crown the evil came the reign of Ignorance, grades of caste, party politics, and Priestly sway—when many a clever scoundrel"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 80 called himself the Interpreter of Divinity, and sacrilegiously bringing down the Supreme Benevolence to his own mean level, made him appear as avaricious, bloody, and revengeful as himself. Religion, which should be Faith in a just and kind God; a never failing consolation to the unhappy, and a balm to the wounded mind, became a trade, and was sold as merchan- dise, until its spirit, seeking sanc tuary in a few honest breasts, left only its pompous ceremonies and heartless mummeries as the stock in trade of the traffickers. Without these few pure souls, a virtuous man might have looked mournfully around him, and reproached oar common father for having abandoned everything to the Genius of Evil. But with the evil came the remedy.—Masonry arose! Some few master-spirits preserved the emblems of the sacred fire, and under various titles Poets, Historians, and Philosophers, seemed united by a mystic chain, whose links, connecting every epoch, enclosed all in a circle, whose centre is eternal Truth. Its radius spread from one end of the world to the other. A sacred and symbolical word would call the virtuous to rally and close to each other’s aid, or extend the hand of sympathy from Dan to Beersheba, to find out and succour the distressed, whether in the hearts of cities, or the wilds of the desert. Pilgrims of this faith have undertaken distant an d toilsome journeys; dared the rigours of the polar regions, the destructive fevers of the tropics, suffered the hellish tortures of the Red Indians, the Chinese zelot, and the Persian Priests, not for wealth and power, but to succour and save a brother. Thus, by initation, the noble minded of every country, formed a symbolic union, founded on Morality, Love, and Humanity. No one remained deaf to the appeal of a brother; and among a crowd of similar circum- stances, we have selected the following for its sublime simplicity:— A disciple of Pythagoras, travelling in a wild and almost bar- barous country, far from home or friends, was taken sick in the cabin of some poor people, who, although they were themselves"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"A REOPAGUS ( 18 °- 20 °) 81 suffering from extreme poverty, assisted him with what they had, and took the tenderest care of him. His sickness was long, but their hospitable solicitude never abated. Grateful for their attentions, but lacking the means of recompensing their disinterestedness, feeling himself on the point of death, he asked for a flat stone, and tracing on it some symbolic charac- ters, he besought them to place it near the road side. He died. Many years after a disciple of the same school accidently passed, perceiving the stone, read the inscription; and watered it with his pious tears, hastened to acquit the debt the deceased had contracted, although he ha d never known him, or ever seen him; but in the mystic writing he was requested, as a brother, to fulfil a dying man’s wishes. Masonry, then, was the system which our Sovereign Master chose as the means to preserve benevolence and learning upon earth, and though we may see some fail in their duty and defame our noble institution by their wickedness and folly, do we not know that on earth nothing is perfect, and that virtue even is subject to abuse. Let us remark, however, that when these abuses multiplied, and everything seemed a prey to evil, God drew from the treasure of his inexhaustible love, his most priceless gift. Jesus appeared—that sublime regenerator, that supreme and incomprehensible being, that glorious light shining between the past and future. Christ, the pacific conqueror, peaceably advanced before the amazed world, carrying aloft his banner whereon is inscribed “Love one another.” It was his theory of conquest, and will yet restore all nations to innocence and happiness. These three words contain all the wisdom, all philosophy of the preceding ages. It absorbs and condenses every doctrine ever yet invented for the general good, and gives a tangible shape to every benevolent inspiration. “Love one another.” ’Tis a charm, at the utterance of which the human race awoke from a long and frightful dream to find its hopes of happiness not destroye d, but shining more radiantly than ever—for gradually we shall see despotism overthrown,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 82 and Charity reigning universal over all. Yet we must acknowledge that in consequence of the feeble- ness inherent in human nature, ev il once more prevailed, and barbarism once more broke the bonds that had restrained it, and pouring in torrents from the Northern wilds carried ruin and devastation around. The pitiless sword was the tyrant that governed all; nothing liberal, nothing intellectual withstood its attacks; nothing dared oppose its sway; nothing but Free Masonry, which, like a Minister of Mercy, still answered the appeal of humanity and progress—only being competent to enoucnter cruelty and intolerance with their own weapons, our members donned the helmet and glaive; the lance and shield, and advancing to the East and North, reached from the banks of the poetic river Jordan, to the bleak shores of the Oder and Vistula, and effectually stayed the march of brutish vandalism. Can we contemplate, without admiration, those noble Cavaliers, as gentle after the carnage as terrible in combat; succorring, after the battle, those whom their carnage had overthrown! Need we mention their oath to protect the father- less and oppressed; or that unalterable friendship and touching brotherhood in arms, by which a Knight Mason was a stranger in no country nor under any misfortune. Masonry not only buckled on the sword and shield for the defence of society and Religion, but furnished with the square and compass, it raised gigantic Cathedrals, noble monuments on which our ancestors inscribed their creeds in 1anguage as simple as profound, and their traditions descending from gener- ation to generation, in their origin al purity, stand to this day as landmarks of Faith, Patience, and Self-denial. The tie that united these chivalrous Knights was the “cable tow” of Masonry, that strong symbolic cord which binds so many thousand fragile brands into one resistless body.

In the bosom of the Universities was preserved that spirit of free inqniry which by instigating religious reform, did so much towards the regeneration of humanity, and still more by Print- ing, that powerful vehicle of thought, that wing of God, which carries abroad, with the rapidity of the wind, the results of human intelligence. The invention of Printing determined the emancipation of the human spirit by secularising science. Constantinople was taken and Rome accorded a noble hospitality to the illustrious proscripts of Greece; even the cannon civilises by adjudging the victory to genius and discipline. Thus the first Printers, realising the importance of their work, formed themselves into a powerful corporation, and guarded carefully the sacred arcanum of their mystery, fabricating in silence, under the direction of Reason and Philosophy, the arms which gave Liberty to the world of mind, and annihilated Feudal and Religious Despotism for ever. The discovery of America led to a revolution in the commerce, property, and finances of the ancient world. The intruduction of gold from Mexico and Peru lowered the price of the precious metals, and created a new property and power— that of capital. Then succeeded Adventures beyond sea; the whole globe becomes agrandised, colonies commence, the military, and merchant marine grows apace. The small interior sea of the ancients becomes but a basin, of little importance, since the riches of India arrived in Europe on the crest of the tempests. All these events contributed to revive the fire of Masonry and project its rays into all civilised countries.

The warfare against the powers of evil still goes bravely on, and freedom marches ever onwards, toward the conquest of the world. The vast power of public opinion reaches and controls even the occupants of despotic thrones. The West cries,—be of good cheer, the eagles gather together for the doom of tyranny is at hand.

S YMBOLS AND EMBLEMS were the primitive language of the people of the East. The horse represented courage, the ox strength, the the serpent cunning or prudence. Such symbols were adopted by theology to designate the distinctive attributes or divinity, and science and art had no other language. The symbols were further designed to express a grand idea of the creator, a dogma, a doctrine, or a belief. The grand hieroglyphic used to express nature, recalled to the intellect that eternal animation witnessed in the planetary world, the destruction and generation of beings, of which the sun was considered the primary cause, and the moon, in its absence, the secondary cause, the one typifying the father and the other the mother. The symbolical and emblematical lan- guage was that of the priests, savants, and architects; not because it is hidden and mysterious, but because it personifies and perfectly characterises the truth of things. It follows that since symbols an d emblems have been used to conserve Freemasonry, during the lapse of centuries, and shew its true origin, they ought to be an object of great veneration to the eyes of the brethren; but th ey have a further sacred appli- cation which sanctifies their ordinarily wise use amongst us. Under their metaphysical envelope is found the basis of the religious dogma and philosophy of the institution. Each symbo- lical or emblematical figure is the image of a natural truth which serves as a torch by which a brother may enlighten his reason, and clear for himself a straight way in the passage of life. In the modern classification of Freemasonry, each degree has its symbols and emblems, which are but the luminous lines traced for the intelligence of the initiate, by which to arrive at"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 86 the discovery of the essence of truth, and of what is good and just in each thing. Our order is divided primarily in to three degrees lengthened into three serial divisions, because the ancient Temples were divided into three portions; the first for disciples, the second for believers, and the third, or most holy place, for divinity. Our ancient architectural brethren divided their churches and cathedrals into nave, chancel, and communion for the same reason, and separated the last from the two former by the rood- screen. Even so should our own symbolical temples be arranged. In the first degree you are taught morality and the love of mankind; in the second, the natural sciences, and more especially mathematics, which were anciently termed, the gate of the gods; in the third you are raised to a knowledge of the dogma of a life beyond the grave. In the first serial division of our rite are embodied our elementary principles; in the second our scientific teaching; and in the third our philosophy and sacred theosophy. These three states were anciently symbolised by the rough and perfect ashlar, and the white marble stone of true die or square. The mosaic pavement represents the ancient doctrine of the dual principles of good and evil. The two pillars, J. and B. in their original import are those of Hermes and mark the solstitial points. The flaming star, is Sothis or Sirius. The seven steps represent the seven properties of nature—attraction, repulsion, circulation, heat, ligh t, sound, corporiety, symbolised by seven cosmogonical deities or hieroglyphical representations. Thus, as we have seen, the emblems of the sun and moon have an abstract signification. The insignia of the degree of Rose Croix is a rose united to a cross, the rose symbolising the secret and the cross immortal life; this is the key of the grade, but the moral and philosophical sense contained in these two emblems are the secrets of science at which one can only arrive by sp ecial study. Secrecy is a wise virtue, leading to happy lessons of prudence, moderation and"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"C ONSISTORY ( 21 °- 26 °) 87 intimate confidence. The Rose Croix Mason, in directing his studies according to the fraternal and humanitarian spirit of Masonry, necessarily forms a just idea of this virtue and of the truth of its moral quality. It is the same with the symbol of the cross, that most ancient emblem of eternal life; in considering the immortality of the soul, as a glorious prize reserved for the wise man who consecrates his life for the happiness of his fellows, noble inspirations and ge nerons sentiments are born in his heart; for such immortality is not the stimulant of egotism, nor the illuaion of prejudiced pride, it is the recompense which T.S.A.O.T.U. reserves for virtue. The symbols and emblems of a Rite each contain in their metaphysical expression a ray of the true light; the explanation is but a scientific development of these figures, leading to a certain knowledge of the moral principles of masonry. The ancient initiates recognised each other not only by signs and grips but by the rules of conduct which their principles pre- scribed; the fraternity was not then formulated entirely in words or in demonstrations, it was all in action, it was the heart which did the work, and as nature regulated the movement there was no ambiguity of either language or thought. God, country, love, devotion, liberty, equality, and all the other words which express such great things, and which people for so long a time have employed to accomplish so much evil, had a precise and absolute sense; there is no better logic than that which comes from the heart, when the love of God and man dominates it. There are some enlightened Masons, who, seduced by the false glitter of the profane sciences, imagine that the symbols and emblems have neither social bearing nor solemn character, and who desire to see them no longer figuring as the sacred lan- guage of the Masonic code. According to them it is necessary to nationalise its language, in order to place Freemasonry in accord with the age, and cause it to march in spirit with the sciences and arts, as they are traced by contemporaneous intel-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 88 ligences. These are errors which it is necessary to combat because they are dangerous. Men of science are now only wad- ing the stream which our order forded centuries ago. More- over, an institution founded up on the eternal principles of natural law can neither change nor vary its doctriues; for that trnth which emamtes from the bosom of divinity, can have but one way of expressing itself and but one mode of instruction. And in order that this truth be not subject to false inter- pretations and eccentric heresies, it has need of a universal 1angnage immutable in its foundation and form, both in its figures and expression. The hidden and problematical sense of language, has, in all ages, crea ted confusion and disorder in the world and led the human heart from the way of reason and truth. Symbolical langnage rema ins constant to the nature of things, and to their interior and exterior properties and cannot, in consequence, change its signification or figurative expression without destroying its distinctive properties. Art is mute thought and reproduces itself nowise better than by images; it is symbols only which, in speaking to the eyes, recalls all the attributes of nature to the mind. A universal language, which so far from becoming corrupt by old age, perfects and enriches itself, is a precious help for an order which is spread all over the world, and divided, into little bodies independent of each other; it conserves unity of faith, purity of doctrine, orthodoxy of laws, homeogenity of teaching; lastly it is the electrical fluid of that social language which permeates everywhere with the same free effect. To deprive Masonry of its sacr ed symbolical language would be to spoil it of its direct strengtht the breath of its universal animation; it is that which preserves all the charms which attach to its beliefs, and the sw eet hopes which inspire its phil- anthropical efforts. There is in this mysterious system that which the spirit ought to he able to comprehend without seeking to define it. That which is essence and light may be represented by symbols, but cannot be explained by the logic or"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"C ONSISTORY ( 21 °- 26 °) 89 words. It is faith which sees and conscience which decides. The Oviathan symbolism of the Ophites, or the Sephiroth of the Hebrew Cabalists, which enclose in a simple table the attributes and spiritual properties of the Deity, are grand and sublime images, inspiring in us admiration and respect, but imposing humility on science. If you wish to evict the sot and exclude the indifferent and the impious, give not to proud philosophy the means of subtilising upon our doctrines and of materialising our faith. Respec t the veil under which nature hides her mysteries., content yonrselves with the mute language in which it speaks to your reason; itself is a grand symbol, the perfect image of a supreme providence. Remain faithful then, my Brothers, to the language given to you, by which to imitate the eternal and beneficent love of T.S.A.O.T.U., study and perpetuate our symbolism. HI S APENATH P ENCAH .

The kernel of the earth, I have formed of so hard a substance, that the water of the ocean, which covers and dissolves all bodies, cannot penetrate it, whilst the surface is kept moist by the permeating waters. Two opposing forces cause the oscilla- tion from pole to pole, of this immense mass of earth, and the waters accumulated in the abyss, which yet are preserved by this even balence from destructio n. Vast forests are surrounded with long chains of mountains, capped with clonds, from which they attract the nourishing waters which furnish to the flowers their inexhaustible rivers, meandering to the seas by insensible slopes, and traversing countries over which they spread fresh- ness and life; these rivers are incessantly contributing to the oceans and to the waves, which maintain their level without ever overflowing, and rendering back to them that which the winds and the heat have attracted from their surface; the reservoirs which traverse the bosom of the earth in all direc- tions receive the excess of these tributaries, and overflowing the surrounding banks inundate the earth. Streams, spouting trom the bosom of the earth, after having passed through their subterranean course, and vapours of fertilising rain, warmed by the heat of the star of day, unite with matter to cause fermentation in the inert and immobile mass, from which is born and to whic h returns all created beings. This mass of matter cracks and, lifts in all its parts and becomes covered with a carpet of verdure. Thus are nourished immense forests inhabited by animals; delicious groves reserved for mortals.

Within the bosom of the motionless greenish pool from which man swerves as from a corrupt dwelling, are animated beings, in their simplicity approaching the elements, beings long unknown to mortals who had no suspicion of their existence, nourished with the juices obtained by dissolution, and thus reentering the mass of animated matter whilst themselves serving for food to other beings. These waters collect all kinds of bodies and by friction give them back to earth; from their bosom warmed by the sun, arise vapours invested by the twilight and the dawn with the most lively colours, which the atmosphere receives and transforms into fertilizing rains. The decomposition of certain bodies serve for the formation of others, the generation of living beings breathe, with the air, the emanations of that which has just been extinguished; children are the coffin of their fathers, all set out from th is animated matter and turn by turn all return to it; it is the same mother world reborn unceas- ingly from its own ashess, nothing can depart from its allotted sphere or be destroyed, nothing perishes.

It is a state contrary to our institution. What man, inflated with vain pride, dares to say, “I raise myself by thought above other men, and break the chains which unite me to them; I fix my attention on divinity alone”? For mortal men it suffice s to love each other, sustain the weight of each others’ feebleness and enjoy without abuse the riches which nature produces; it suffices for each to follow the secret inspiration which they bear in their heart, this guide will never turn them from the path of virtue, the mother of true happiness.

This great nation had a thoroughly developed religious system 6 , 880 years ago, about which time Menes united Upper and Lower Egypt into a single empire and embodied a hieroglyphical representation of seven great cos- mogonical and psychical gods wh ose worship had prevailed in the twenty-six Nomes of that, even then, ancient country. This great Emperor; the decendant of a race of prophets, priests and kings, built the Temple of Memphis and advanced the worship of Heseri and Isis in the whole united empire. He established at Memphis, the seven sons of Ptah, who with Neith produced Ra or Helios, the creative power of the solar orb which again produces Agathedæmon, spirit, or breath. After this Chronos or Saturn and Nu or Rhea, time and space, produce Heseri and Isis, Set and Nephthis, and they Horus, Anubis, and Hermes or Thot h, who is the Revelator. In the Egyptian Book of the Dead will be found a description of the progress of the human soul in the future state. Some copies of this book are at least 4500 years old, even then accompanied by commentary upon commentary, proving that the great antiquity of the BOOK , at that time, was such that the educated priests themselves had a difficulty in interpreting its esoteric secrets.

The object of the book is to teach the spirit how to avoid the “Second death in Hades” and to deliver itself from its various adversaries who might seek to detain or destroy it, on its passage or destiny. The sun is symbolical of this, for the Ritual says: “Ho! workmen of the sun by day and by night, the Osiris lives after he dies, like the sun daily, for as the sun died and was born yesterday so the Osiris is born.” “He is the son beloved of the Father, he has come from the mummy a prepared spirit.” Aware of his divine nature, the spirit exclaims, “I know that I was begotten by Ptah, brought forth by Neith.” Like Osiris the spirit is the victim of various diabolical traps and persecutions over which he triumphs by gnosis or knowledge, of celestial and infernal mysteries which he has le arned. At length, the soul of the deceased Heseri, is conducted into the presence of the divine father who is seated with forty-two jndges in the “Hall of the Two Truths,” symbolised, as truth and justice, by the cubit and ostrich feather; and distingnished as immortals or gods, by the ring-handled tau cross. Here he denied forty-two sins. The soul is described as goin g in like a Phoenix; having passed through the roads of dark ness he comes forth with joy, exclaiming: “I come forth with justification against my enemies; I have reached the heavens, I have passed through the earth; I have crossed the earth at the fo otsteps of the spirits a living chief.” Brilliant as the Sun, the gods exclaim, “Hail coming as Tum, created by the Creator of the Gods,” and of the sun they exclaim, “Hail thou greater than the gods, rising in the heavens ruling in the gate! Hail thou who hast cut in pieces the Scorner and strangled the Apophis,” by which simile mortals were encouraged to combat against darkness and evil. The renovated soul performs all the old functions of life, but:— “There is not a limb of him not as a god.” He is triumphantly crowned as a faithfnI soldier of the gods, who thus address him:—“Thy Father Tum has bound thee with this good crown of justification, with that living frontlet: beloved of the gods, thou livest for ever.”"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 100 The religions faith of all mankind derives from a single central source; with us the Great Spirit developes into the Being Jehovah, as Brahm into Brahma, and Kneph or Ptah into Osiris.

Thy imagination is unable to conceive a world peopled with beings superior to thyself! If chance is a God, to which mortals have knelt, they ought to conjure a better state of things! If inert matter has created thonght, if T.S.A.O.T.U. is a child of the imagination; the idea of his existence was the most vast, the most sublime of all man’s thought; it is a man then who is the creator of the universe, the least perfect of mortals was the first of beings; it is he who has made what the earth adores as its sovereign, it is to him that his fellowmen ought to raise their altars. In vain, will it be, that a mother prostrates herself, to waste her grief on the tomb of some mortal whom she adored, to sorrow for that loss which she most cherished, and to desire to launch herself into eternity with the lost one. In vain, will be, that hope of a better state which sustains a virtuous and per- secuted man, dragging himself to the end of his career, for he will find beyond it,—Naught? It will be in vain for the culpable man, torn with remorse, to prostrate himself on the tomb of his victim! Since the poor man is but the dupe of virtue; since there is neither recompense nor indemnity for long privation; there only remains for him the resources of crime and its concea lment. The bonds of society are broken and men may flee into the forest for protection. Why should man care to cultivate his heart and spirit, for reason, knowledge and sensibility will only serve to render him the most unfortunate of beings, if his soul is not immortal, if there is no God.

In Atheism there is nothing fo r imagination, nothing for mis- fortune; man is sustained by hope and lives upon its sweet illusions. Why deprive him of the most conaolotary of these? The truth, say they, the truth! The fanaticism of that truth is then very cruel, since it assi milates man to the brutes and deprives him of the hope of immo rtality. But upon what solid foundation shall we believe that matter and chance have formed the universe, since the nature of things entirely belie it? If matter has created the universet itself, by blind necessity, whence arise in us all those grand ideas and sentiments so contrary to its principles; whence do we derive all such charac- teristics as prudence, prevision, and choice, so repugnant to the system of fatalism. Whence come conscience, remorse, moral law, natural duties, and the idea of liberty felt by all men. If blind chance has formed the world, whence above all intell- igence and wisdom; why the affinities between beings possess- ing these qualities, wherefore have they order and idea? No, my brother, it is only the fool who has said in his heart there is no God, immortality is the inna te conception of mankind from the earliest era, and the doctrine which we here enforce.

T HE PLACE OF MEETING of the Patriarchs of Truth, represents a subterranean hall, situated in the lowest depths of the inmost recesses of the Great Pyramid of Cheops; the only entrance to which was through a series of gloomy corridors, small winding passages but three feet wide and the same in height, leading to the month of a dark and terrible abyss, apparently of immense depth, down which the Patriarchs descended. The external of this gorgeous edifice was the sy mbolism of the world built upon the purest principles of astron omy, astrology, mathematics and geometry. The interior was a temple designed to teach and illustrate those sciences. Then the soul of man was regarded as a direct emanation from the deity, and its fall from spirit to dense matter, its transmigration and ultimate birth into man- hood, and its redescent into anim al forms in the case of the brutalised man, or, if the divine element prevailed, a new birth into the god-like nature. These were the stages of the glorious drama which these temples were built to display, and chief of all the great temple of Cheops, which the founders by abstruse astronomical calculations designed should be the physical centre of the world a.nd the metaphysical centre of their sublime teachings. This dumb bu t eloquent atructure is full of mystical revelation, to those who possess Gnosis. The base line of this great building is 761 feet, and occupies over 13 acres of land, its vertical height is 480 feet.

The canon of proportion is 3.14159 and the origin of all the ancient standards of measurement in time and space. Each side of the base sy mbolises a quarter of a year in the computation of 100 inches per day, or 9131.055 × 4 = 3654.22 inches, thus each side is 515.1647 cubits, a sum which plays in important part in the internal symbolism, as it is"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 104 the cubic diagonal of the king’s chamber, being also half the greatest circumference of the coffer, the capacity of which is 4000 cubits, or 70898.151 cubic inches. The base is a perfect square, symbolising the union of the male and female principles of creation; the sides, a perfect triangle, symbolise the masculine principle of nature. Twice in the year the beholder witnessed the sun as if resting upon its very apex. The different stages of the mysteries celebrated within its bewildering passages, grand chambers, galleries, sunken shafts ending in secret crypts, the descending passages all leading to sepulchral edifices, the ascending galleries and noble chambers with lidless and empty sarcophagi, all speak to the heart of the true Master. But their spirit is found in the grand law of universal correspondence, which makes geometry the plan, and mathematics the sum of all things, binding together colour, sound, form, function, matter, spirit, man and his creator, each planet with its solar system, and these with the entire Universe in one stupendous scheme of ha rmony. Sounds and colour are but spiritual numerals; as the seven prismatic rays proceed from one spot in the heavens, so the seven powers of nature, each of them a number, are the seven radiations of unity, the central, spiritual sun.

Egypt, whose very origin is obscured by the mists of countless ages, upon the banks of whose great river, Nile, once stood 30 , 000 magnificent cities, some whose population seem of almost fabulous amount— whose gorgeous Temples and whos e mighty works of art, laugh to scorn the efforts of modern civilization. Their architectural works have withstood the ravage s of time and the destructive hand of man, for thousands of years, and will for ages yet to come; still the gigantic pyramids rear their unbroken summits to the clouds, eternal mementos of a mighty race. Egypt, the mother of civilization, the home of wisdom and of art, when Greece and Rome were yet unsung, unheard of, and the mighty empires of the present were not. It was in this land of Egypt, in the valley of Memphis, that our beloved Rite first assumed a cognate and coherent form and gained from the greatest and best of Egypt’s Sages those divine lessons of Wisdom, virtue and charity, which with their knowledge of the arts and soiences combined, has preserved through sixty centuries or more, even through wars, famines, plagues, barbarism and the darkness of the middle ages, the Antient and Primitive Rite in all its pure unsullied beauty. At the most remote period, Masonry flourished in Egypt and attained so strong a footing therein, that all the most learned and powerful of its population were members of the mystic tie. The archives of the Rite of Memphis can reckon amongst its votaries such names as Orpheus, Homer, Pythagoras, Thales, Virgil, Hippocrates, Socrates, Plato, and many other great names of Greece, that intellectual daughter of Egypt. Trip- tolemeus, Erechtheus, Cadmus and many others tore themselves from the charms of home to carry the light of civilization to barbarous peoples.

Pythagoras dared the most frightful perils in travelling the banks of the Nile to learn from the hierophants how man may become happy by being virtuous. The wealth and influence of the order was almost beyond comp utation. Buildings of enor- mous magnitude were erected in which our rites were celebrated. The greatest precautions were used to guard our mysteries from the profane, so mu ch so, that in the time of the Grand Hierophant Moeris, the successor of Osymandias, he caused a great lake to be dug around the temple, sacred to our meetings, and called it after his own name; but in the course of ages that lake became choked up by the sands of the desert and the meetings of the Rite, from that time, were held in the Pyramids in chambers expressly adapted for every degree of the Rite. From every part of the then known world came the most learned philosophers, the most heroic warriors, the most power- ful princes, seeking admission within the portals of our temples. Willing and eager to submit to the rigorous examinations, the long probations, the fasts, the vigils, the hardships, the terrible trials of courage, strength, endurance, and intelligence, which were then exacted from all candidates before they were allowed to receive even the first degree of Isis. The Greek and Roman mysteries were nothing but corrupt perversions of the moral teachings of Masonry, but the Jews who acquired their know- ledge of the Craft in Egypt, were so truly imbued with the pure doctrines of the Rite and its teachings, that they preserved them intact, with the exception of altering the names and locality and as it were nationalizing the earlier degrees. Such, my Brother, was the origin and rise of this Rite which now exists in every civilized country of the world; which counts its associates by thousands, whose principles are founded on truth, justice, humanity, and vi rtue; and whose power for good excels that of all the pontiffs, emperors, kings, and potentates of earth combined."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 108 A STRONOMICAL S YMBOLISM . W HEN THE FIRST MEN began to nnite in society, they found it necessary to apply themselves to agriculture, the practice of which required the observation of the heavens. It was requisite to regulate the duration and the succession of the seasons, the months and years. In order to do this, it was imperative to become acquainted with the course of the sun, which in its Zodiacal revolution, appears to be itself the first and supreme agent of all creation; then the moon, by its changes and returns, regulated time; lastly the course of stars, and even the planets; in a word to establish an entire system of astronomy. Then, observing that the productions of the earth bore a regular con- nection with the phenomena of the heavens, men conceived an idea of power in these bodies and they became to them Genii, Gods,—authors. of good and evil. By the more learned it was noticed that the sun originated fertility; and that the moon had its effects upon the tides, whilst generally the bodily health was influenced by the heavens. Records were made of eclipses, comets, the varying positions of the heavenly bodies, and the effects of these upon animate and inanimate matter. Hence, by comparison of these careful enquiries, arose the belief in astro- logy as a science in which man’s destiny was infuenced chemically and magnetically. The Sun became the first symbol of God; the Moon his consort; the Planets, servants; and the multitude of Stars an array of heroes to govern the world. It was thus, on the shores of the Nile, that the complex system of Star-worship, as con- nected with agriculture, was constructed. The Thebans called stars of Inundation, or of Aquarius, those under which the river began to overflow. Stars of the Ox or Bull, those under which it was convenient to plough the earth. Stars of the Lion, those under which that animal, driven by thirst from the desert, made his appearance on the banks of the Nile. Stars of the Sheaf, or"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"C ONSISTORY ( 21 °- 26 °) 109 the Harvest-maid, those under which the harvest was gathered. Stars of the Lamb and of the Goat, those under which these animals brought forth their young. Having observed that the return of the inundation of the Nile was always preceded by the appearance of a very beautifnl star, towards the source of the Nile, which seemed to warn the peasants against surprise by the waters, they compared it to the animal, which by its barking gives notice of danger, and called it Sirius or the dog-star. They called others, Stars of the Crab, which shewed themselves when the sun having reached the bounds of the tropics, returned backwards and sideways, like the Crab or Cancer. Stars of the Wild-goat, those which,—the sun having arrived at its greatest altitude,—imitated the action of that animal who delights in climbing the highest rocks. Stars of the Balance, those which,—the days and nights being of the same length,— seemed to observe an equilibrium like that instrument. Stars of the Scorpion, those which were perceptible when certain regular winds brought a burning vapour like the poison of the Scorpion. From these things it resulted that, by a very natural metaphor, men said,—“the bull spreads upon the earth the germs of fecundity (spring), an d brings back the revival of vegetation. The Ram or Lamb as it was of old called, delivers the heavens from the evil genii of winter, and saves the world from the serpent (emblem of the wet season); the Scorpion pours out its venom upon the ea rth, and spreads disease and death.” In process of time, man lost sight of the motive which led to the adoption of these expressions; and the allegory remaining, the people saw their gods before them and offered up their prayers to them. They demanded of the Ram of their flock, the influence which they expected from their celestial Ram. They prayed the Scorpion not to pour out its venom upon nature. They revered the fish of the river, the crab and the scarabeus of the slime; and by a series of corrupt, but insepar- able analogies, lost themselves in a labyrinth of absurdities."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 110 Moreover, the hieroglyphical sculptures of the priests were similarly misinterpreted; for as the Sages taught that God was found in all forms, through which spirit transmigrated in becoming man, so the ignorant worshipped these creations as deities, whilst they were but emblems representing some of His attributes, Such was the origin of this ancient and singular worship of Animals; and thus was formed the vast system of theology, which, from the banks of the Nile, spread over the world. A more elaborate allegory was de veloped in Persia, out of the solar system, to which also we fi nd allusions both in India and Egypt. With the Zoroastrians there were six periods or months under the dominion of Ahrima nes—darkness, and six periods or months under the dominion of Auramazda—light. It was when the sun entered Virgo that the serpent or dragon of the constellation was crushed, and a new sun born. The allegorical narrative of the Boundesh 1 thus represents each month as a thousand years and reads as follows. The Supreme God created at first the man, and bull, in an elevated place, and they remained 3000 years without evil,—the lamb, bull, and twins. After this, 3000 years transpired without further trouble,—the crab, lion, virgin. After this, at the 7 th thousand, evil appeared,—the balance. Man was named Caimorah, and cultivated the earth. The stars began their career in the month Farvardim, which is the new year; and by the revolution of the sky the day was distinguished from the night, such is man. The balance is the turning, or point of evil. Another passage says,— Ahriman, the principle of evil and darkness, by whom evil entered the world, penetrates into the sky in the form of a serpent;—or again; made himself a road between the sky and the earth. Macrobius thus speaks of the Mysteries of Bacchus, who was Dionysos and Osiris. “The images or statues of Bacchus, repre- sent him sometimes under the form of a young man, at other 1 [More normally transliterated Bundahish .]"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"C ONSISTORY ( 21 °- 26 °) 111 times with the beard of a mature man, and lastly, with the wrinkles of old age. These differences relate to the sun, a tender child at the winter solstice, such as the Egyptians represent him at a certain day, when they bring forth from an obscure nook of their Sanctuary, his infantine image, because the sun, being then at the shortest, seems to be but a feeble infant gradually growing from this moment.” The equinoctial points of spring and autumn at 4 , 500 and 2 , 500 years before the common era were the bull and the scorpion, and the constellations of the lamb and balance then replaced them. Mithra no longer triumphed under the sign of the Bull, but the Christian Lamb, 1 from whose rising to that of the Pleiades, or 40 days, there was a ceremonial rejoicing. It was at the two points, Aries and Libra, that the astrologers fixed the exaltation of light and its degradation. The Egyptian Sphynx unites Leo and Virgo. Virgo gives birth to the new sun upon the 25 th. December, who becomes revived in splendour, when he enters the sign of the Lamb on the 25 th March. HI S YMBOLICAL N UMBERS .

The idea of one Supreme Being is common to all religions, even if they run into polytheism and idol worship. The Para- Brahma of the Hindus, Eternal Spirit of the Buddhists, the Zeruane Akerene of the ancient Persians, the Supreme Essence floating on the surface of the dark waters of the ancient Scandinavian mythology, the Belus of the Chaldeans; the Ulômos, or, El-om-os, eternal, rational, conscious God, of the Phœnicians, the Kneph of the Egyptians, the Virococha of the Mexicans, all are identical and represent the God of the Jews, Christians and Mohammedans. Every faith has its two opposing influences of good and evil ,—God and Satan, Brahma and Moisasur, Ormuzd and Ahriman, Belus and Moloch, Osiris and Typhon, Vitzliputzli and Tezcatlipoca. All have their heavens and hells, and prominently three have purgatories, namely,— Roman Catholics, Egyptians and Parsees. The Brahmins have their trinity in unity as we Christians have. These three are represented by gold, silver and iron, or the three peaks of the holy Mount Meru. In the Brahminical mysteries, the Mysta- gogues represented Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, or the Sun in the East, South and West. The number four is common to all,—the four elements, the four seasons, the four cardinnl points, North, So uth, East and West, but it is almost useless to multiply instances of this; the cavern of Elephanta is supporte d by four massive pillars. The number seven occurs so frequent ly in all religions and cere- monies that it almost conclusively proves a connecting link. between them. Let us commence with the seven days of the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"C ONSISTORY ( 21 °- 26 °) 113 week, and the seven planets of the ancients. The Jewish Rabbis describe seven hells and give their names. The Mohammedans believe in seven hells and seven heavens. Zoroaster says that there are seven classes of demons; there were seven Gothic deities; the seven Pleiades; the seven Hyades; the seven Titans and Titanides; the seven Heliades of the Greeks; the seven Cabiri of the Phœnicians; the se ven sons of Ptah at Memphis, and the seven great and seven lesser Gods; the seven Amschas- panda of the Parsees; the seven Manus; the seven Pitris, Rishis, or Sages of the Aryan race; the body of Bacchus was cut into seven pieces by the Bacchantes; there were seven holy temples in Arabia; seven lamps in the temple of Bactria. The name of the wife of Thoth is Sfkh, Hebrew Sebah, or seven; her symbol is seven rays, or five rays and tw o horns, in allusion to the five planets and sun and moon, by which the festivals and seasons were regulated, and which Philo Herennius of Byblus qualifies as “creations without consciousness through which rational creatures are generated; called Zophasemin, or Heaven watchers.” I might cite a thousand instances of its universality. To readers of the Bible I need not mention its continual recur- rence in connection with all its most important events. The number twelve is similarly met with in all religious rites; the Egyptians had twelve Zodiacal gods; the Scandinavians had twelve priests, and Jesus had twelve disciples. It is a remarkable circumstance, that many of the institutions and ceremonies of the Buddhists and the Roman Catholic Church so closely resemble each other that the two appear almost identical; now, as the sect of Buddha is eight or nine hundred years older than the latter church, how can we possibly account for this mysterions coincidence? The greater portion of the Buddhists believe that their prophet was born of a virgin, and the Parsees claim that Zoroaster was born in a state of innocence, without sin, that he spoke as soon as he came into the world, and was guarded by angels in the cradle.

The precise origin of Masonry, like that of all the grand insti- tutions, destined to exercise a powerful influence upon the future of humanity, is lo st in the night of time. In the midst of an uncultivated people, T.S.A.O.T.U. gave birth to a great genius; this man, the honour of whose birth- place has been disputed by all the nations of antiqmty, and who has been named by turns, Manu, Ammon, Odin, Prometheus, assembled the scattered families, instructed and civilized them; at his voice the primitive arts arose out of Chaos, and the earth, feebly cultivuted, responded to the efforts of the first culti- vators; a second creator of the world, he announced to them a Supreme God, immutable and eternal; he spoke to them in his name and spread over them those beneficent rays of light which T.S.A.O.T.U. gave him. This legislator of the world, born perhaps, on the delicious banks of the Ganges, or the Indus, before his eyes were closed, lived to behold the imposing edifice which he had built. The descendants of this Sage followed the course which he had traced for them; conservators of all the arts and sciences, they admitted to partake of such knowledge only such privi- leged men as were rendered worthy by their virtues and great qualities. From the bosom of this Corporation of Sages shot forth the light which illuminated the universe. Not content with making the happiness of their own conntry only, these great and wise men assumed the glory of civilizing the rest of the world; from the plains of Persia, they passed into Ethiopia and descended its mountains in to the delta of the nourishing river of Egypt, and instructed the people by the institution of the mysteries. Menes was the first King, and flourishing about 5000 years ago, he united Upper and Lower Egypt, and ordained all the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 116 laws of religion and Masonic Science, making of it one harmon- ious whole, and confided the deposit to the highest dignitaries of the sacerdotal caste. In order to keep from the vulgar, the knowledge of the sacred dogmas, they enveloped them in alle- gories, and the better to baffle the curiosity of the profane adopted hieroglyphics. Thus confined to the profundity of their sanctuaries, the mysteries were revealed to but a small number of initiates, who previously submitted to a series of proofs, and engaged themselves by a solemn oath to inviolable secrecy. Each city of Egypt adopted its particular symbol. The eloquent Memphis, the chattering magpie; The bee, which elevated its thoughts to heaven , decorated its banner with the eagle and eye of fire; Canopus chose the incense vase, to sym- bolize its homage to the divinit y. The Sages who watched over Egypt, were prepared in Heliopolis for the solemn mysteries of Memphis and Thebes, where they guarded the divine fire. Menes terminated in Memphis his long and glorious career, and his people after his death acco rded him divine honours. Thebes included four magnificent temples, one of them, according to Diodorus of Sicily, who visited the ruins, measured a thousand and a half cubits round and forty cubits high. Thebes was named the city of a hundred gates and of a hundred temples. The successor of Menes was the Sage Patrusim who employed an entire army to lay the foundation of one of those gigantic monnments near to Egypt, which border the desert. Already beautiful and flourishing, Egypt became yet more great and powerful under Osymandias. This Patriarch of the Order constructed near the Nile, the most splendid temple known to the present day; he had there accumulated all the riches of the known world.

The sacred fire of Masonry burned during a thousand years without any capable attempt being made to extinguish it. This sublime institution reckoned in the number of its Adepts, Hermes, Orpheus, Homer, Pythagoras, Thales, Hippocrates, Plato, Zaleucus, Lycurgus, and a crowd of other philosophers of Greece, that daughter of intellectual Egypt. Whilst upon the banks of the Ni le the august depositaries of the traditions veiled them from the eyes of their contemporaries, and revealed them but to a smal l number of those whom they deemed worthy of initiation; other Adepts in the interior of Africa, reassembled the uncultivated tribes, polished their manners, propagated science, and in short, founded our sacred mysteries amidst the burning sands of Nubia. Meroe, on its side, instructed the Gymnosoph ists. Zoroaster founded the schools of the Magi in Persia and Media. Amongst all the legislators of the world, we recognise the most sublime ideas of God; in Brahma, Fohi, Zoroaster, Menes, Hermes, Minas, Moses, Cecrops, Orpheus, Zaleucus, Carin- ondas, Lycurgus, Solon, Numa, Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Manco Capac, the child of the su n, who was father of the Incas and legislator of the Peruvians.

They veiled under emblems which the multitude construed literally, the truth which had its devotees in the Temples of Saïs, Helio- polis, Thebes, and Memphis. Thus, as was the case in China, Greece, ancient Rome, as also among enlightened people of the modern world, there were two religions in Egypt; that of the multitude, which addressed itself more to objects of the external world, and that of the enlightened, who disregarded such objects, or viewed them only as important in an allegorical sense of sublime significance, covering great moral truths or great features of nature.

The Masonry of antiquity was comprised within three degrees; but in the present condition of society, it is impossible that Lodges can now be so constituted as to convey the whole doctrines of the sacred science within those limits to the initiates. There is still great resemblance between these magni- ficent old ceremonials and modern craft masonry, in the laws, the ritual, the use of the sacred name of T.S.A.O.T.U. which was given as a talisman and passw ord to the initiate, to fortify his spiritual nature in the ascent to the Halls of Osiris. On the other hand the Christian church adopted many of the exoteric symbols of the Egyptians. Isis, the Queen of Heaven, the, mother of all things, the mother, the nurse of the divine human soul, or Osiris, is represented in pictures as a mother caressing 1 [I cannot comprehend how such a statement could have been made in all seriousness by anyone who had even read Herodotos and the books of Kings and Chronicles (see my note, p. 12 ).

Further, as modern commentators have pointed out, the main account we have of Cambyses— i.e. , that of Herodotos—is derived from primarily hostile sources, namely ( a ) Egyptians, who resented him as a foreign conqueror and ( b ) Persians sympathetic to Darius and Xerxes, who sought to present him as an usurper.

Another common symbol is the “Sacred Heart:” the spirit of Osiris was said to become incarnate or born again in the person of his son Horus, who, placed in the arms of his mother Isis was represented with a flaming heart in his hand. In India. the mediatorial god is represented as wearing a heart on his breast, and with the mark of the wound in his foot, from which he died, and for which lamentation was anciently made. During all the period of the middle ages, which embraces several centuries, our sublime instit ution gave little signs of life, but it revived after the Crusades, which had so marked an effect upon the developement of light and social well being; the rude warriors of Europe were polished by contact with the Saracens, and bore to their Donjons some relics of the ancient arts and the sweet customs of th e beautiful climates of Asia. Admitted, as we are, into membership with this sublime institution, let us devote ourselves unceasingly to the attain- ment of the highest perfection possible, to the study of science, to the developement of knowledge and of generous ideas, to the accomplishment of our social duties, and lastly, the practise of all virtues. May our Order cont inue to strengthen and expand, until its light encircles the whole universe. HI T HE O SIRIAN L EGEND . T HE HISTORICAL LEGEND on which this degree is founded, is probably the oldest in the records of the bygone ages. The ceremonial enactment of “His sufferings,” as Herodotus, the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 120 father of History, terms it, as too sacred to be mentioned without a veil, was the highest degree to which the Egyptian laity could attain; the highest mysteries of all were the appanage of the priestly caste alone. The Egyptian fable says, that Osiris, King of Egypt, was the “son of the Sun,” who born on earth, died, became the presiding judge of the dead, in th e Hall of the Two Truths. He was incarnated in order to bene fit mankind, to rule them, to teach them civilization and the useful arts. He was destroyed or murdered by his brother Typhon, the embodied Prince of Evil; he descended into Amenthes or Hades, a kind of prepa- ratory purgatory, and though his body was buried in the earth, he rose again, and with the aid of his son Horus, overcame Typhon. This type or symbol of regeneration, is equally sugges- tive with what has already been revealed to you. By some nations Osiris was called Bacchus, Dionysos, Adonis, Baal, Moloch. In ancient times; also, in Jerusalem, “behold! there sat women weeping for Tammuz,” and all these murdered persons are one and the same, and typified by the Sun. During your progress in this degree, you must have perceived the strong ceremonial resemblance which it bears to the ritual of Hiram. It was still more marked in the old dramatic ceremonial of the Ancient Master Masons, and when their hero was murdered by three craftsmen, whose names are a corrup- tion of Jabal, Jubal, and Tubal, 1 the inventors of tents, music, and metals, the brethren sought their lost master, by forming a procession round the room cryi ng, “our master is lost, and cannot be found, and cannot be found, &c. The salient points of the Master Mason’s degree can be traced back astronom- ically to a definite period of time as a representative legend, 1 [The three assassins of H.A. are unnamed in most modern English workings; in American 3 ° workings they are generally called Jubelo , Jubela and Jubelum . In the “Rite of Perfection” degrees “Ele ct of Nine” and “Elect of Fifteen” they have various other names: Akirop or Abiram; Gravelot or Nebo; and Zabad or Guibs, or sometimes these compounded with the former, thus Jubelum Akirop, Jubelo Gravelot, Jubela Guibs.]"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"C OUNCIL ( 27 °- 30 °) 121 when it originated the cherubic or sphynx symbol. The German Masons give a bearing to the legend which is undoubtedly astronomical. At the Eastern door they place Hobbhen the first assasssin, that being the side wh ere the sun first emerges above the horizon; Sterke they place at the South gate where the sun is most strong; lastly, Austerflush takes a position at the West gate, where the sun finishes his apparent march, the end of his course. 1 Equally with that of Memphis, the tomb of the Master Mason symbolises life, death, and immortality, it is the emblem of the apparent course of the su n. A purely allegorical legend, it is really the expression of the grand and profound law of regeneration, which requires the violent death of the initiated as the necessary end of all initiation. Exoterically considered the Master’s secrets may be divided into five parts. 1 . The exposition of natural religion, universal and immu- table by means of symbols and maxims—the secret of the operation of nature explained by the quaternary and the monad , these figuring movement or cause, fermentation, or the means, putrefaction as the effect, and life and death as the result. 2 . By joining them together as matter and subject, we figure the five elements of generation, of which the operations are expressed symbolically by the middle chamber; which, in that sense, is the womb wherein the mystery of reproduction is accomplished. 3 . The perfection of the temple, that is to say, the human heart. 4 . The victory of darkness and winter over the sun, and that of the sun over darkness, figured by the death 1 [According to a note in Duncan’s (quoting George Oliver’s Freemason’s Treasury , 1863 ) a pre-Union English ritual had the murderers wait at the east, west and south doors, and earlier eighteenth-century rituals just had “the three principal entrances to the Temple”; the order east, south, west is said to be retained in a Scottish ritual. In the Duncan’s ritual itself the entrances are in the same position and the order is east, west, south. One side-degree gives the legend that the building originally had entrances in the four quarters but the north was walled up after a badly-set stone fell out and killed a workman. In post-Union English rituals the order is, as stated, north, south, east.]"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 122 and resurrection of Hiram, (the son); 1 minister of the most wise monarch (God); conservator of th e Temple (earth); master of works (mankind); slain by three wicked companions ( 3 winter months 2 ); raised and avenged by nine virtuous masters 3 (Spring, Summer, and Autumn, months which give flowers, harvests, and fruits); child of the widow, (the earth which is widow of the sun during the winter months). 5 . The victory of errors and passions over truth, and that of truth over errors and passions, figured by the death an d resurrection of Hiram. The master’s word symbolises regeneration, and signifies literally “born from putrefaction,” and gives an idea of the conditions necessary for the development of other beings, and the principles of new existence. Amongst the Egyptians, the sun in its course was the general symbol of God,—the spiritual sun, and also of the birth, life, death, and resurrection of the soul of man; and the victory of light over darkness, which the sun daily achieved, was made symbolical of that contest against evil, in which it was necessary that the faithful soldier of the divine Heseri should engage. Amid all these resemblances it may be observed that as the legend of Osiris is above 5000 years old, and as the Mysteries of Isis in which the Neophyte had to pass through the same ordeal which you have done tonight, we re celebrated throughout the land of Egypt, many ages before Moses led the children of Israel into the desert, your own judgement can easily decide which is 1 [Except that H.A. died, was buried, an d stayed dead and (after a couple of re-interrals) buried.] 2 [This interpretation is made problematic by the fact that in most versions of the legend, the murderers were three of fifteen and not three of twelve. There is a late variant familiar to the present editor in which the murderers are three of twelve, but it very late (ca. 1916 ) and was deliberately re-written by someone familiar with this school of interpretation.] 3 [In the usual English version of the Master Mason legend, fifteen Fellow Crafts who had nothing to do with the conspiracy are deputed to go and find the body of Hiram and hunt for the murderers. In the American ritual in Duncan’s it is the twelve who withdrew for the conspiracy who are first sent to find the murderers and then to look for the body.]"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"C OUNCIL ( 27 °- 30 °) 123 the original fable. I say fable, for though to the mass of the people, Osiris was a real King, it is very certain that to the priest- hood the legend was merely a be autiful allegory, teaching many astronomical and physical truths, and having a deep signifi- cation. The story as told by the Egyptians is close1y adhered to in this degree, with one exception, for it was Isis herself who discovered the body after a long and weary pilgrimage, and numberless adventures. A part of his dismembered body was claimed to be deposited with each of the 26 Egyptian nomes or provinces, forming a complete body, with the exception of the generative parts, which were never recovered, and may symbolize chastity. In some of the legends, the body was said to be divided into 14 parts, representing the days from new to full moon, and from that to the wane. The lotus is at times substi- tuted for the tamarind tree. It is a plant consecrated to Isis. Daily with the birth of the sun it rises from the waters where it has slept during the night, following the glorious eye of day, with its swanlike neck in its circular round; to sink again, to rest its nightly baptism, from which it is re-born each morning to a new life. In the material aspect, Osiris and Isis were the two deified impersonations of nature in Egypt. Osiris symbolised the Sun and the Nile, and Isis the moon and Egypt, and both the solar year. In another view, Osiris was the setting Sun in Amenthes, and the realms of darkness; Ra or Serapis and Horus the new- born sun. The Egyptian year has a two fold seed and harvest time. The first is the vernal season of the year, and extends from February, when the seed is sown, to July when it attains maturity. The second is the autumnal division, in which an interval of time, from the last of September to the end of November marks the season of semination, which is succeeded in March by the golden harvest. Thus Osiris dies and revives twice a year, and Isis, or the earth is doomed to bewail his death, or rejoice at his return. His fixst death happens in the spring, from March till July, which is the season of intense heat,"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 124 and scorching winds from the Libyan deserts, these being the type of Typhon. Isis, the parched land of Egypt, mourns the loss of the Nilotic Osiris in his vernal death. This state of misery lasts seventy-two days, wh en the Nile god awakes from his death-like slumber to fertilize the earth. Soon after the sun has entered the sign of Scorpio, the autumn death of Osiris is at hand, he wavers in his power and allegorically dies. Typhon triumphs for a while, but soon Osiris is found; the sun gains strength, ascending in its orbit; the grain appears above the sur- face of the soil, everywhere there is new life, and nature is born again. Lamentation is made for the one, rejoicing for the other. But this is only the physical aspect, behind it is the real and spiritual signification. 1 Indeed, most of the Egyptian Symbols had a meaning triply varied, the full explanation of which was possessed only by the higher class of priests. There are therefore, many different qualities attribited to Osiris. He is in the higher signification, the primitive man-god, the celestial father of Egypt, before whom the shades of the dead appear and receive their final sentence of bliss or torment. In this aspect he is named Serapis, 2 and distingnished by the great name. His worship was that of Chrestos , On Nophre, 3 the good, excellent God. The highest spiritual signification is found in the sacred Egyptian books. They expressly state that the physical relation 1 [This statement demonstrates a woeful ignorance of the evolutionary pro- cess as applied to the development of re ligious symbolism and doctrines.

Serapis was imported into Egypt during the Ptolmaic era ( 4 th century B . C . E .), and was represented there as a synthesis of Osiris with the Apis bull (see the hieroglyphic form of the name). A Mystery-Rite of Serapis was set up at the same time as his public worship, on the model provided by the various Greek systems of Mystery-Religion.

HI H ISTORY OF THE R ITE OF M EMPHIS . A SK MOST MEN who have seen Masonic light for a description of that sublime institution, and thinking that everything is confined to the exterior symbols which strike the eyes, they will tell you that science as found in its Sanctuary is but a vain word, and that they have found nothing capable of firing the attention of enlightened men. From this cause have arisen many ingenious system s, often erroneous if not censurable, converting the lodges into a Masonic arena for the idle curiosity of a multitude of superficial minds; who desired to write their thoughts npon it, as if it were a blank book. We may, with grief, compare their couduct to the graft of a heterogeneous fruit upon a valuable tree, or, with that of those monks of the middle ages who hesitated not ro erase precious master-pieces of antiquity, which they did not understand, in order that they might place upon the same parchment their own insipid 1 [Rather, Ptah and Neith were identified with Osiris and Isis in a later, syn- cretic, phase; they were originally though t of as different people.

It is greatly to be regretted, that the majority of Masons are satisfied with a mysterious appearance, and conten- ted with hearing certain words pronounced, of the meaning of which they are ignorant, and with inexactly imitating certain signs. But when the philosophic al observer, surveys the past centuries and mounts tsto the first cause, and the real aim of our Sublime Institution; when the lamp of study has directed his steps into the obscure labyrinth of the ancient Mysteries, and some success has crowned bi s search, eager for further instruction he will knock at the door of our temple, and seek new knowledge where he finds the venerated ark of tradition Sublime Masonry, is a continuation of the mysteries of antiquity. We find in Asia, among tha Aryan race, the ancient institution of the Brahmins, and from the same primitive national cradle the knowledge of sublime truth passed into Africa, into Egypt, where, at a remote period, were established the Mysteries of Isis which have so striking an affinity with those of our sublime institution. To arrive therefore at the cradle of Masonry, we must traverse the centuries up to the first ages of the world. After the golden age, brute force reigned supreme, and those who were wise united their common weak- ness, and concentrated in their midst a school of science and acquired virtue, some of the crumbs of which they spread for the people in symbols and emblems. The old Sages were known as Gymnosophists, and they sought union with the Deity. Their principles are recorded in the sacred Vedas of India; the Zend-Avesta of Persia, and the Book of the Dead in Egypt. They now exist only as a feeble and dispersed tribe known as Shamaners . They were conquered by the wild children of Vishnu, who considered that they came to civilize the world. Two legislators of the name of Zoroaster spread the Aryan doctrines in Persia. Th e first was contemporary with Verengham, the father of Djemshid the Just; and laid the basis of the religion of the Magi, which spread far and near, and was religiously observed until the birth of the second Zoroaster, who"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"C OUNCIL ( 27 °- 30 °) 127 went from Egypt, and whom some try to identify with Abraham. The Magi conquered Babylon 4000 years ago. They passed to Meroe in Ethiopia, then a powerful and enlightened country, now destroyed, and, descending the mountains, civilized Egypt, at a very remote period, by fo unding the Mysteries of Isis. Thence they passed into Samothrace under the name of Cabiri; Danaus, Cadmus, Triptolemus, acco rding to Diodorus of Sicily, were the propagators, while Abaris carried them to the Hyper- boreans. What is known as Craft Masonry was an architectural division of this grand institution. Theut or Thoth, called by the Phœnicians Taaut, and by the Greeks Hermes, is termed the author of Egyptian learning, and the revealing God. The Egyptians named the first month in the year, Thoth after him; according to Diodorus, he was the chief minister of Osiris, and invented letters, instituted religious rites, taught astronomy, music, and the first rudiments of science, and caused his teachings to be engraved on stone tables or columns, which he dispersed over the country for the instruction of the people. One of the principal uses. to whioh these symbolical inscriptions were applied, was to teach the doctrines of a spirit- ual religion, and maxims of political and moral wisdom. “Ancient Memphis, ’ere the ready leaf was known, Engraved her precepts and her arts on stone, While animals, in various order placed, The learned hieroglyphic column graced.” The Greeks from the North, received their secret doctrine from Cadmus, who founded at Thebes 1 a Cadmium or school of religious science, and Erectheus, the first king of Athens, estab- lished the mysteries of Eleusis in that City, where those of Ceres, for we must, not confound the two, already existed. These mys- teries, like those of Eumolpus of the Cabiri, could never attain the high importance of the Egyptian, which were only partially disclosed to Triptolemus, who, on account of his weakness was 1 [ i.e. , Thebes in Boiotia, not the Egyptian wast , called Thebes by the Greeks.]"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 128 unable to endure the second trials, but the Priests of Isis were more generous to Orpheus, beeanse they felt the need of sending a legislator to still barbarous Greece. After regulating the Mysteries of Eleusis, Orpheus instrncted Melampus, who established them amongst his neighbours in Argolis; Troph- onius in Bœotia, and the celebrated Musæus at Athenes. Dardanus carried the mysteries into Phrygia; Apollo and Neptune, allegorical beings like the Egyptian Mercury, intro- duced them into the Troad; which is emblematically signified to us in the constrnction of the City of Troy, at which they were employed under the disgnise of masons. Initiation spread into Ganl, where colleges of Druids were founded, a word which in Celtic signifies to “speak with God.” The Druids were rlivided into three classes,—Vates, keepers of secrets; Bards, singers of hy mns, Saronides or Sanothees, inferior Priests. The theocracy of the Druids retained unexcep- tionable traces of the ancient Orient, and these Sacrificers always made efforts to maintain the secret sciences, all their instruction was oral. These Mysteries ceased to exist in France with the ruin of Alesia, a great town of Celtic Gaul, capital of the Mandubians in the Lyonnaise, the Celtic Thebes, ancient metropolis or the Druidical culte, famous for its sacred college, civilization, schools of philosophy, grammar, jurisprudence, medicine, astrology, occult science, architecture, the Gallic rival of Thebes, Memphis, Athens and Rome. Cæsar with true Roman barbarity sacked the temp les and colleges of initiation, and massacred the initiates, after which Britain became their recognised home, and they are last heard of as Culdees, a sect of Christians at York and elsewhere. The worship of Vesta is same as that of Isis, and the Latins may have obtained their knowledge, either from the Trojan refugees or the Etruscans, as the institution existed at Hercu- laneum.

At a later period, Solomon, who was initiated into the mysteries of Eleusis, in his quality as a king’s son, and married to an Egyptian Princess, restored initiations among the Israelites, and deserves to be called a founder, as also Thales amongst the Greeks. They were again resuscitated by Judas, the prophet of Jerusalem, 55 years before the common era, after which they fell again into disuse. The secret doctrine of the Egyptians was divided into three parts, 1 . Dualism , or the belief in two principles; 2 . Sabaothism ; or Sabeism, that is to say the adoration of the forces of nature, submitted to a supreme power; 3 . Jahohism , or the worship of one God independent of the material world. The Patriarch Abraham belonged to the second class, but Moses arriving at the highest degree announced to the Israelites Jahoh, El, Elion, —Jehovah, God. All nations, with few or no exceptions, had their mysteries concentrated among a few men, bound by a terrible oath religiously kept, which separated them from the multitude, hence the full revelation was known only to the sacerdotal body; it may be, however, that some of them had been indiscreet, that human intelligence had made progress, that the captivity of the Israeli tes tended, to unveil the myster- ies. Outside the Initiates there were men who merited the name of Sages and studied morality, and the assimilation of man with the divinity; of these Socrates is the most celebrated, for by the force of this spirit he acquired the sacred doctrine. 1 Pythagoras popularized initiation, and rendered its teaching accessible to all who had the desire to learn. That man was one of the greatest of mortals, and philosophy owes its name to him. Enriched with every intellectual an d natural gift, he travelled in to all parts of the then known world to cultivate science; he interrogated all the Sages, listened to all the traditions, sub- mitted himself to all trials, in order to arrive at a knowledge of 1 [In the lecture “The Pyramid of Cheops ” it is claimed or at least strongly implied that Socrates was an initia te of the “Egyptian Mysteries.”]"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 130 the Mysteries. Everywhere civi lization followed his labours in the diffusion of light, and his na me will be honoured from age to age. Christianity was the exaltation of the moral mysteries, and like them had a double doctrine and divers degrees of initiation. Even those who deny the supernatural birth of Jesus accord him, as a man, a merited tribute of admiration and gratitude. What Moses did for the Hebrews, Jesus did for all people; he gave to them the word of life, enfranchised the slave, raised the dignity of women, proclaimed equality; and from him we must date the emancipation of the human race. The early Christians had what was called the Disciplina Arcana ; the Disciple , Believer , Perfect Brother , the latter being the mystery of the sacrament, and the church was ruled by the three classes of Bishops, Priests and Deacons. They had also secret means of recognition. Other resemblances of a striking character exist, which have been developed in our ceremonies. The Christian mysteries reached the throne with Constantine, and Valentinian abolished the Mysteries in the year 396 of the common era, but they still continued to be celebrated under various disguises. The Roman Mysteries had degenerated; Egypt was equally troubled under the successors of Alexander, and degenerate rites were known under the denomination of Alexandrians, which succeeded to those of Memphis. Rome knit her brow against those of Antinous. Arminius, who was educated at Rome by Augustus, was initiated into the mysteries of Eleusis, and founded with 49 of his companions in Germany, the Mysteries of Hertha, a deity like Isis, Ceres, Vesta, Cybele. After the general suppression, the Initiates were obliged to conceal themselves in the deserts, or expatriate themselves amongst the barbarians; they felt more than ever the necessity of secrecy and divers degrees of initiation; there were few written documents, and most of the members were ignorant of the oral traditions and the hieroglyphical veil which covered these things."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"C OUNCIL ( 27 °- 30 °) 131 Then came the Arabian prophet Mahomet, who drew his inspiration from the then prevalent rites. The Saracens after their first conquests became more polished in their manners, and protected, or at least tolerated our mysteries. They suffered the Patriarchs to conceal the archives and the written doctrines of our order upon the banks or the Nile, and these are now gradually becoming public property. This concession was the more meritorious on their part, because the masonic spirit was essentially progressive, and op posed to the fatalism of the Moslems. To the crusaders do we owe the resuscitation of Sublime Masonry, and its introduction into Europe. Despite misfortune, the East long continued to be the land of religion and of glory, to the champions of the cross. Their eyes were ever turned to- wards that glorious sun of Palestine, the palm trees of Idumea, and the plains of Ramah, where the infidels reposed under the shadow of the olive; towards that field of Ascalon which still shews the vestiges of Godfrey de Bouillon, Tancred, Philip Augustus, and Richard of the Lion-heart; towards that holy city, freed for a time, and then subdued and chained, appearing to them as to Jeremiah, sitting solitary and drowned in her tears, bereaved of her people and her temple. Five times, during two centuries, did the warriors of the West direct their march against the Moslem power, and that gigantic strife which caused the shedding of seas of blood, was fertile in the most precious consequences to humanity. The valiant survivors brought back with their banners, the light of Masonry from the banks of that famed river where once trod Osiris, Hermes, Orpheus, the great Menes, and the magnificent Sesostris; from the sacred spot, the pure centre, beneath the starry vault, from the thresholds or those mighty temples, they had obtained a dim view of the mysteries of light and truth.

It is the true Masonic tree, of which there are many branches, but all united in their doctrines, and in the first three degrees, only differing from each other in point of detail. Amongst the numerous rites, we may summarise these:— 1 .—The Indian Rite , or mysteries of Botulo, possessing three degrees of science, it is a theoretical and practical course of moral and religions philosophy, aiming at the development of the state of ecstatic trance and adeptship. 2 .—The Chaldean Rite , which has three degrees of construc- tion and three complicated. It originated in India, and was termed in Egypt the Mysteries of Isis. 3 .—The Memphis Rite, a contination of the dogmas of antiquity, amplified to 90 degrees of work, and 6 of office, and embracing all masonic knowledge, but reduced, in the year 1866 by the Grand Orient of France, to the 33 degrees of our Antient and Primitive Rite, in three series, and seven classes as primarily, and developing Symbolic, Hermetic, and Egyptian Masonry. 1 4 .—The Japanese Rite , which has considerable relationship to those of Western Asia, and possesses three degrees.

In 1866 , Marconis, admittedly under pressure, supposedly turned over complete control of the Rite to the Grand Orient of France, but shortly afterwards chartered Harry J.

It is only when he has resisted the last and greatest trial, that he is received: by the discipline which they enforce, the initiates in the hall of spirits, are brought face to face with the shadowless dead. They are doubtless anterior to the time of the Crusades; and are at present in affiliation with other similar Eastern Associations. 8 .—The Turkish Rite , of the Celestial Em pire, was founded by Ali who was punished with death.

HI O N E SOTERIC AND E XOTERIC M ASONRY . A GREAT POET , one of the glories of the age of Augustus, who, for his genius, was judged worthy of the favour of initiation,— Virgil,—in the sixth book of hi s immortal Ænied, wishing to enshrine some of the Rites of the Egyptian Mysteries, and in order to turn from his head th e maledictions, which he knew would be fulminated against a divulger of their secrets, upon approaching these remarkable revelations, thus speaks in depre- catory language. “O! God, whose empire extends over the soul! O! silent shades! O! Impenetrable Chaos! O! Phleg- ethon’s devouring waves! breaking upon the distant plains, in the silence of night! Since it is not allowed to me, to reveal that which I have heard, under your powerful protection; per- mit me to relate things, plunged in the profundity of the abyss; environed in mysterious clouds.” Surrounded as we are by the brilliant lights of this Sublime Council, we are able to dispense with these invocations, and umbrageous precautions. It is related by an ancient Greek Philosopher who had overrun Egypt, and visited the principal Sanctuaries of Science, that the capital point of the Priestly doctrine was its division into Exotericism or external science, and esotericism or internal"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 140 science; and it is by these two Greek words, that he translates the two Hieratic words, which he understood were inderdicted outside the Temple. He says, that the Priests were not prodigal, of any part of their science; long labours, profound studies, rough trials, were imposed on the Neophytes before they could arrive at the lowest degree of exotericism, whilst for esote- ricism the proofs were still more severe. No aid, no counsel, no encouragement was given to those, who tried to penetrate to the higher mysteries. It was by strength of spirit, and by divine inspiration alone, that the aspirant conld arrive there. It fre- quently happened that the Poutiffs who held the highest digni- ties had hardly made a step in the mystic part of the Sacred Science. There were mysteries within mysteries, as there are yet in the similar associations of the East and the West. The Statue of Isis, always veiled, even to the Hierophants, the Sphynx crouched in silent repose at the door of the Temple, were the emblems of these last esoterie secrets; the despotism of strong and violent men extended over all the earth and this reserved policy was dictated by wisdom and necessity. We will not endeavour to fix a date in the remote past, when the Patriarchs sought to conceal the treasure of man’s greatness and equality, before the throne of the creator, and to reveal it only to those who had proved themselves worthy by severe proofs; but after Christianity had popularised the moral part of the mysteries, the road of the philosopher was made smooth; he was able to be more explicit in his teachings, for Christianity, in recognizing the right of religious discussion, and the teachings of intellignece, had strengthened his powers, and the human spirit by the force of its natural expansion did the rest; and liberty of thought was proclaimed. It is to this great progress, which places us in a much better position than the philosophers of antiquity, that we owe the ab ility, without placing ourselves in opposition to our august tradition, to partially raise the veil of Masonry withont tearing it away entirely; and althongh we have nothing to fear, from an irruption of brute force in the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"C OUNCIL ( 27 °- 30 °) 141 dominion of thonght, we cannot without crime, expose the assemblage of Masonic knowledge to the slight reflexion of the superficial; the false interpretations of bad faith, the scorn of ignorance, or the persecutions of fanaticism; for our mysteries in order to be appreciated demand an attentive and devout spirit, a pure and independent heart, seeking only truth and justice. Our science is the means by which we can accomplish the admirable aim which we have in view; that of making humanity one mighty brotherhood. Our traditions say, that, ‘no one is worthy of science who has not conquered it by his own efforts.’ 1 Upon this point we are a little more easy than our severe Masters, and, if we are interdicted from revealing this science to those who have no title to it, we can transport the Neophyte to the mountains where he can behold it. Perhaps, inflamed with ardour at the sight, he will labour to meri t a p]ace in our Grand Elected Army. Masonic esotericism embraces the entire circle of activity of the human soul; all science, all art, all thought, finds itself displayed, and it is only negligent of the elementary and practical part. Esotericism embraces the transcendental and metaphysical part, leaving to exotericism the disposing spirit and the executive talent: it is reserved for genius to create. Three cycles united in mysterious order by an indissoluble chain, and reciprocally corres ponding in an ineffable manner, form the Mystic Temple.

The cardinal, and almost solitary, aim of the Antient and Prim- itive Rite, is to enforce the observance of a pure and rigid morality. Notwithstanding this, its avowed professors have been subjected, from the earliest times, to wicked persecution at the hands of malicious and ma levolent neighbours. In the intrinsic merit and austere purity of Masonic morality, is to be found, alas, the chief cause for its incessant afflictions. Free- masonry endeavours to compass virtue; and virtue is ever a stumbling block in the way of transgressors. Freemasonry is based upon truth, and truth is abhorred by the disciples of[ passion. Freemasonry seeks the di ssemination of light, science and tolerance; the experience of history teaches that light, science and tolerance have ever been persecuted by the vain- glorious, the ignorant and the fanatical. Hence, see you not, that the persecution of Freemasonry follows as a natural conse- quence of benightenment, folly, and hypocrisy. There is another reason why Freemasonry should draw upon it the wrath of the worldly-minded.

It is from the Egyptian Institutes of Isis that Masons have deduced those maxims of moral virtae which have for so many ages rendered our order the consolation of sages and an object of veneration with enlightened communities. The institutor, a Sage from the banks of the Euphrates, with a genius as brilliant as his comprehension was profound, founded a new order in moral enjoyment, which borrowed its life from the knowledge of a superior sphere. It seems as though this divine law-giver, whose legislation was religiously sublime, spurned the grovelling earth with aspiring tread, and mounted to a pinnacle in the celestial world whence his searching eye viewed the mysteries of the universe, and unveiled the secret springs which regulate the revelations of nature. Zoroaster was a disciple of this system and taught the worship of that templeless Deity who pervades the entire universe, to a people whose thoughts were lost in the immensity of space; and who congregated around him to learn tidings of the gr eat, the mysterious and the infinite. These people adored the stars of the celestial canopy as scintillations from the great central light; they venerated the golden ruler of day as a beneficent and live-giving power, and sought consolation at night beneath the paler reflection of the silver-eyed moon. This great legislator, who has been caIled by turns,—Isis, Osiris, Thoth, Hermes, Manu, Zoroaster,—disdained the com- position of an epic poem, and aspired singly to create a political constitution, which was to perpetuate its force, by blending with the habits, manners, cust soms, and religious observances of the people. In this spirit he wrote his statutes upon the tablet of the human heart, with the aim of directing man to civic perfection by reproducing venerated characteristics at every hearth with the aim of regeneration. He composed pre- cepts rather than laws, maxims rather than precepts, popular manners rather than maxims; for popular revolutions and a"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"O FFICIAL G RADES ( 31 °- 33 °) 147 change of customs might overturn codes of laws, while precepts, and a solid regulation of manners, placed beneath the protective shield of religion, would outlive the destruction of empires. Everything, however, decays beneath the hand of time. Laws grow obsolete, precepts wither, and even the most popular customs lose their force; but maxims of moral worth never perish: they become identif ied wIth the impulses of daily life, follow men from the cradle to the grave, and are trans- mitted from one generation to another, with the blood flowing through the veins. The basi s and model of our Mystic Institution was carried from the nations of Tartary, and became an ever watchful guardian over the sacred fire of popular liberty, and the palladium of a profound nationality. Concealed beneath the mysterious sanction of religion, it defied the assaults of authority and tyranny; whilst by means of fables, legends, emblems, and oracles, it shaped and fashioned the opinions of the multitude. In this wise it exercised the privileges of a moral magistracy, shunning the ambition of intoxicating power, and inculcating a reverence for the precepts of wisdom and justice. Embellished, rather than deformed, by an august mystery, and adorned with the sanctity of pure religion, an Institution of this marvellous character was truthfully regarded as the eighth wonder of the world. Admira- tion was conjoined with veneration for this sublime creation of ethical wisdom, and pervaded the intelligent and enlightened of the ancient world, to such a degree, that Egypt became the Academy of Nations, the Mystic Seminary, so to speak, where statesmen and lawgivers acquired the rudiments of political ethics. The wisdom of the Egyptains became, by reason of this profound veneration a household proverb with the peoples of antiquity; and Sages from every clime, way-worn pilgrims in search of everliving truth, craved Initiation into the Mysteries of Memphis and of On and regarded not its fearful trials and probations.

This school of politi cal instruction assumed the name of the Mysteries of Isis and Osiris, as a distinctive title, in order to render a grateful homage to the memory of its founder. Nevertheless, in time, posterity confounded the sagacious Patri- arch with divinity, and the apotheosis of an illustrious, but mortal, lawgiver, with the symbols of the virtues which he had preached and practised beneath the shelter of that honoured name. The initiates alone preserved the distinction, whilst they not only tolerated, but absolutely nourished, a popular error, which they rendered subservient to the graver considerations of national morality. The grand maxim of these lawgivers was justice. It forms the social foundation; unblest by its presence, society would riot in outrage, violence and depravity; without it, the advancing spirit of civilization would be trodden down beneath a rule of tyrannic disorder. Justice is em phatically a masonic virtue; our ennobling precept is that of Aristides,—“Ever be just, as well to enemies as to friends;” and by the practise of this rule we exalt our individual reputations and glorify T.S.A.O.T.U. A divine providence continually watches over the oppressed, and its hand hangs in perpetual judg ment over the head of the oppressor, who knows not at what moment it may strike him. To the unjust Judge the image of his victim is ever present, mutely rebuking his iniquity, whilst his conscience is racked by the torture of perpetual anguish and remorse. The robber, the assassin, the myrderer, may perchance palliate his crime by pleading some extenuatiug circumstance which absolves moral guilt; but he who does an injustice to his neighbour by wilful transgression, brands himself as an object who should be cast out from amongst the human race.

The primitive times knew it"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"O FFICIAL G RADES ( 31 °- 33 °) 149 under the name of Astrea; others called it Themis, but the divinely enlightened termed it, sirnply,—Truth. In their allego- rical language the ancients made out Justice to be the daughter of Truth, and gave it Virtue fo r a sister; Truth itself was the daughter of Saturn, or Time. We may enquire,—why did they make two distinct beings of Justice and Virtue, or why did they make Justice to be born of Virtue? Did they conceive man to be, at the same time, virtuous and unjust? We must not hastily blame our forefathers, for this contradiction contains a very sensible lesson. Virtue being collective, comprehends the entire duty of man,— filial piety; conjugal love, temperance, charity, modesty, patriotism, civic courage; but there is not one of these virtues which does not presuppose Justice, which is anterior to all of them, and therefore too important to be made simply a part of Virtue. One man is sober, another charitable, that a good husband, the Decii, and Assis were devoted to their country. Cato was a rigid magi strate, Aod and Brutus immolated tyrants, Leonides died for his country, Ly curgus legislated, Fenelon was devoured with love for his neig hbour, Howard for the criminal, Vincent de St. Paul was the Apostle of Charity: each possessed some virtues, but what man is perfectly virtuous? Therefore the ancients, with reason, made Justice a separate being, a divinity, having its own altars and its own worship. Without Justice there are no virtuous acts, there can be no complete virtue; it has place in all, it prescribes all virtue. To follow the law of Justice, man should be temperate, because intemperance destroys the faculty of sound judgment; he should be charitable because its voice says,—it is unjust to rejoice when thy brother is afflicted. and to keep for thyself the good things which nature has cr eated for all; he should ba tolerant; because be comprehends that it is unjust to impose his own opinion upon other men, who possess like himself the faculty of reason; he will bea g ood citizen, because he knows that it is a social duty; good father, good hnsband, good son, good brother, for these are natural duties; he will say;—it is by"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 150 justice that we accomplish the duties of nature and society, and by it man is rendered submissive to the laws of duty. If you wish to become wise, begin by entering upon the path of virtue, Justice will be your guide, and by following it you will be just. Justice is innate in the hearts of all men, and has the con- science for trothman. Conscience never fails us, it is a speaking witness which only waits to be interrogated; an upright and severe judge from whose sentence no one is exempt; an unpitying executioner which tortur es its victims night and day. Conscience is an importunate a ccuser which manifests itself by a blush on the forehead of the culpable; itswords carry the persuasive tones of truth which command respeet: an evil conscience awakens its victim with a start when a certain hour is sounded, and prevents sleep; it seeks man in solitude, gnaws his soul, and troubles his amusements; it is a cruel Nemesis, the mother of remorse; seeking sleep in the abyss of crime, to arise still more terribly. Yes, O Justice, thou art innate in the heart of man, let those, who desire to be happy, not stif le thy voice. Truth and error dispute the earth, error is the issue of human infirmity; but Justice is unchangeable, whatever be the worship, the laws or the customs; it is the foundation of all society, and without it even two men could not live together; the peace of society depends upon justice. It is tr ue justice which produces repose, and by giving peace to all hearts we lead them to Justice; Virtue consists in the love of the intellectual effects of Justice.

Justice is the first letter of the name of Jehovah, we cannot spell the divine name without we comprehend the sense of each letter which composes it. Pythagoras has said, “God is God, because he is just,” in the same way that a man is called only when we pronounce his name, and because in the primitive language each name was characteristic of its quaIities. Our forefathers, the initiates of begins or closes, know that the Eternal Life condemns injustice.” The Hierophant said to the Epoptæ, “walk in the path of justice.” At Hermopolis the first of the Muses said,—“Isis and Justice are one.” Thucydides sa id,—“Content not thyself by being Just, but permit not injustice.” Marcus Aurelius said,— “Seek to persuade men, if that ca nnot be done, do then, in spite of them, that which justice demands of thee.” When Socrates was asked whether Archelaus could be happy, the Sage replied, “Yes, if he is just.” I cannot too often repeat that Justice is the base of all society; you cannot build upon quicksands and the heart of the unjust man is more treacherous than the sands of the desert; men, societies, empires, all live by it; without it, all perish and die, nothing escapes th is law; it is because the moral world, like the physical world, is submitted to the eternal laws of providence. When the Great Cause created these milliards of worlds, and milliards of creatures for each of them, He made all by this one law, it is imprin ted on all his works, and nothing can operate except by the action and reaction which results from the play of this one law, of which the origin ascends to the Creator. The man who discovered the laws which regulate the physical world was great; the sage who comprehends these and regulates the moral world is much greater; it is these moral laws"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 152 which sustain him in adversity, saying,—“suffer, hope and persevere, the law of the moral world is justice which preserves, or injustice, which, born of violence, destroys.” In fact, if you examine and compare the annals of all people, you will see them in high elevation and burning with a pompous light and then they fall to rise no more; now retrace your steps, and seek whether you can not find some great injustice committed, some right infringed, whether strength has not been substituted for Justice; it is in this manner that we must seek to understand the revolution of empires. Scrutinize the fortunes of men who are happy according to this world, if this fortune, whieh dazzles the multitude, is based upon injustice, it never has had, and never will have, anything but an ephe meral existence; it is because providence watches over the oppressed and chastises the oppressor without telling him why. The ground that imbibes blood and tears, raises to the feet of the Everliving God, in the silence of night, a clamour which is unheard by innttentive mortals. Mankind are punished for the injustice which they commit as well as for that which they have not prevented, for there is a solidarity between all men, and it is not in vain that it was said,—“Love one another.” The sight of anyone towards whom another has been unjust is a livng reproach, which troubles the faculties of the soul and kills them; conscience sleeps not, and executioner and victim understand the voice which punishes and consoles; in Justice alone is found true happiness. FoIlow, then, always, the holy law of justice, which comprehends all the virtues of society, which are but the varied forms and diverse applications of this axiom,—“do only to another that which thou wouldst should be done to thee.” It is perhaps by this axiom that I ough t to have commenced, for it is the Criterion of justice and jnjustice, all people have inscribed it at the head ot their diverse codes, and it is owing to it that we have penalties of retaliation, an d if legislators renounce them God will not.

Have you been unjust to the brute companion of your labours, make some pacification by good treatment, for its instinct has felt your injustice and its brute nature is raised against you; God in endowing man with intelligence has made him king of nature, but never intended him to play the tyrant; His allseeing eye has even the regard of a Father for the poor sparrow which palpitates under your hand. Lastly, if you have been unjust to a brother man, lose not an instant until you repair your fault, or that man will become your greatest enemy; but, on perceiving your contrition he will say,—thanks, I pardon you. But as for me, I say,—thank yourself for this re paration, for its recollection will give you the peace of mind which you had forfeited; glory be to you, for the avowal of a fault never humiliates and Justice renders man truly great. Say then no longer, this man has been useful to me, but he is no longer so, I can neglect him; this is the language of ingratitude, that hideous monster born of egotism. The Athenians were great on that day when on the fields of Marathon they vanquished Xerxes; they were great on the day when the victory of Salamis save d Greece from barbaric inva- sion; but upon that day, when, on the advice of a good man, they sacrificed to justice he who might have been useful, they merited immortality. Kings, Pr inces, and People, follow always and everywhere this noble example. Ah! think you that providence estimates not equally the life of the most obscure man as the most exalted? If so your error is great and your idea of justice very imperfect; all anti quity is full of lessons of this kind. Illustrious Brothers, if you would be completely just be not too ready to judge your Brothers, whatever their apparent errors. If you are called upon to fulfil the painful duty, consider with wise deliberation, and allow every excuse to delay your decision; listen with indulgen ce, shew favour towards the accused, even at the moment when all accuse him.

Leave the profane world to take part in those endless discords where ambition and all bad passions find a contiuual cause for war. Let it be amongst them that the rich disdain the poor, and the strong oppress the weak; Justice will pronounce her anathema on the egotism of the rich and the violence of the powerful. A neophyte being interrogated upon the sense of the two letters J. and B., which decorate our Symbolical Columns answered, Justice and Bounty (goodness), 1 a general acclamation admitted him without further trials to our Mysteries, and he was worthy of initiation. In conclusion, Illustrious Brethre n, never forget that Justice is the superb attribute of T.S.A.O.T.U., to whose praise we have devoted ourselves, 2 and in whose presence we can never hope to appear with the slighest taint of moral guilt upon our immortal souls. HI A LLEGORICAL D ISCOURSE B ROTHER , the Antient and Primitive Rite of Masonry is founded on Religion, Science, Knowledge, and Virtue. Sweet Religion unfolds to man his brilliant destin y; it occupies his mind with ita promises; it is a protector which guides him amid perils; it shows the spirit of loved ones hovering around him; applauding his good deeds, and rejoicing when he shuns the path of passion or of crime. It supports him as he falters amidst precipices; and amid the darkness of ignorance and error, it consoles him who is dying upon the bed of pain. If man, the monarch of nature, is loaded with chains, religion breaks them; her sublime inspi- rations elevate him even to the Deity. 1 [This lecture is believed to have originally been written in French.] 2 [Yes, well that’s because you’re dupes of the Demiurge.

It was Cain, the first born of Adam, who gave to the Angel of Death his first prey. Cain killed his brother, but the soul of the victim flew to the celestial dwelling, where it was thus challenged by the Great Eternal: “Mortal, whence comest thou? Thou hast not yet been summoned!” “I come,” answered Abel, “because thy work is incomplete. Thou gavest man an organized intelligence. At the moment when thou gavest him breath, thou gavest him place over the rest of creation. This being, par excellence, is thy interpreter and thy delegate upon earth; and thou hast subjected him to the eternal laws of matter, and made him the most helpless of all thy ereatures, over whom he exercises supremacy. Thou hast neither given him the strength of the lion, the statute of the elephant, the agility of the gazelle, the dexterity of the ape, the piercing sight of the eagle, the splendoor of the peacock, nor the melodious voice of the nightingale.” “Man and matter,” replied God, “thy complaint is unjust. I have bestowed upon thee three eminent gifts, which more than recompense thee for thy natural feebleness; and given thee empire over all the creatures thou hast mentioned. I have given thee intelligence, to invent, language, that thou shouldst associate with thy fellow man; hands to execute; whilst the animals remain circumscribed within the limits of their respec- tive organizations, slaves of a blind instinct. Thou alone hast received the eminent gift of power to know thyself, to perfect thy nature, and to measure the extent of thy rights and duties.

The first object which struck the sight of the new initiate, was the still virgin earth, red with blood, newly spilled. From the black and smoking spot arose a fetid vapour, which, condensing in the air, gradually assumed the form of a gigantic figure, covered with a black veil; it was Repentance just brought forth by Crime, and there Cain, the fratricidal Cain, prostrate upon the earth, his bosom torn by remorse, and striking his breast, raised his eyes, red with weeping, towards the skies, henceforth the immortal dwelling place of his victim. But God was inexorable to his supplications. At this withering sight, Abel, moved by the most generous pity, could not restrain his tears, but addressing the All- powerful Being, to whom all hearts are open, said: “Eternal Benefactor of Nature, pardon for my brother, or let me redes- cend to the land of suffering and console him.” At this touching prayer, all th e celestial harmony of heaven broke forth; all the heavenly chorus, which surrounds the throne of the Eternal, saluted Abel; all creation gave forth the hymns of mercy and forgiveness; and God looked kindly upon the sinner, and upon the Elect. This benevolent and refulgent look, no mortal can depict; but the just, like Abel, will compre- hend it. This magnificent allegory, of such majestic simplicity, is perfectly Masonic; have we not, for one of our emblems, the trowel; and does not the trowel hide, repair, and reconstruct what vice and crime, would so metimes destroy?

Y OU HAVE NOW , Sublime Prince, almost mastered the entire range of Masonic knowledge; on e step more and you will have gained the summit of perfection in our Antient and Primitive Rite. On this occasion we have required no test of your moral and physical firmness, for you have already been so often tried and found worthy in the preceding degrees, that any further proof of courage and fidelity was needless. In the earlier stages of our beloved Rite, such ordeals could not be dispensed with, for without them, how could we judge aud place reliance upon the newly initiated Brethren. By this time you must have learned, that the end and aim of Masonry is the common good and welfare of all the initiated members of the Order; the diffusion of knowledge, practical charity, mutual protection and fraternal love; and this can only be attained by a strict adherence to the precepts and laws of the institution. Obedience to an established and authorised gov- ernment is as necessary in a soci ety as in a state, especially where the authorities are of our own free selection. It is as easy to suppose that an army can be well disciplined, conducted and provided, without having either a general or officers, as that a society can he efficient without a regular body of recognized officials. It is, therefore, the duty of every Mason to shape his actions in accordance with the obligations which he has contracted to the laws of the time-honoured institution which he has the privilege and blessing of being connected with. The stable foundation of Masonry is a belief in the existence of a Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things in the past, the present, and the future. This grand trust is dwelt upon and earnestly inculcated in every degree of the Rite from the very beginning; without it Masonry would be a body with- out a soul and its teachings devoid of point, meaning and method.

That which is sacred in the eyes of the members of some one sect, may appear childish and absurd to all the others; but in advocating the simple faith in a Supreme Be ing we can all meet on the common ground of mutual toleration, for it is a dogma which carries us beyond the dawn of history and the invention of fabulous traditions. From the earliest ages, the wisest and most intellectual men of all nations have found it necessary to conceal their mature and liberal ideas from the mass of their countrymen, and to form societies of congenial minds for the intercommunication of knowledge and philosophy. This concession to popular prejudice may, at first, seem almost contemptible, but in former days it was absolutely essential to their safety from the blind and bloody persecution of the vulgar herd of society. The ancient priests of all religions were men who belonged to such associations; they preferred to ride in safety on the crest of popular feeling rather than be overwhelmed and destroyed by it; they therefore taught the people such tenets, as they knew would suit their vulgar prejudices and love of the marvellous; they invented legends, made sacrifices, reared images, taught in parables, built splendid temples, and manufactured miracles. This was tangible and satisfactory to the masses, but in the apparent mummery was an inner meaning known only to the initiated; to them these things were only allegories and symbols conveying lessons of morality and philosophy, too far advanced for the popular mind to grasp and understand; for it is far easier to believe blindly than to reason and digest. It is impossible to believe that the gifted and intelIectual men, with whom the spiritual faith of Egypt and Indi a originated, were themselves believers in the numerous gods of their Pantheon or even in the literal sense of the Vedas and sacred books of the Brahmins."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"O FFICIAL G RADES ( 31 °- 33 °) 159 No, they are rather a series of brilliant allegories whose true meaning was understood by the higher castes of the priesthood. Can any one conceive it possible that the great intellects of Greece and Rome, the Sages, Statesmen and Poets of those countries, actually credited the personal existence of their mythological deities? It is im possible. To the common people they were indeed Gods and Goddesses; but to the initiated they were only types and emblems of various passions, qualities and seasons. As regards the Egyptian Mysteries, you are already conver- sant with their symbolical ceremonies and the spiritual inter- pretation of them. Aided by the light of truth and reason we cannot but admire and respect their pure and primitive philo- sophy, and the soundness and accuracy of their instruction. They reveal to us a religion co nsonant with the laws of nature, and inculcating a doctrine simple in truthfulness and beneficent through its universality. Zoroaster also taught a pure system of morality and natural religion under the veil of brilliant metaphor and attractive fiction. This course he was compelled to adopt by the spirit of thc age in whieh he lived, and the Oriental love of allegory; but the veil of mystery once raised, we are startled and delighted by the simple sublimity and beauty of his doctrines, which are almost ident ical with those of pure and practical Christianity. The Druids of Britain, Gaul, and other countries were men who were intellectually in advance of the nations amongst whom they laboured, by centuries; they were the illuminati of their race and age, and possessed unbounded power over the semi-barbarous tribes by whieh they were surrounded. That they were Adepts in many of the arts and sciences is proved by many Druidical remains scattered over Europe, and by such traditional information as has descended to us of their knowledge of Astronomy, Music, Poetry, Elo- quence, natural and mechanical powers, and above all, their belief in one Supreme Being.

That there were many such has been historically proved beyond the possibility of doubt. At one period, civilization would have sunk beneath the waves of ignoracce and barbar ism, had it not been for the active, though secret, exertions of such institutions. Light has ever existed amongst men, but they in darkness comprehended it not; the light of Masonry has revealed, and explained to us, the mighty mysteries of the ancient days, in all their pristine purity and grandeur, and the very simplicity and truth which rests beneath the glowing and brilliant surface 1 of the ceremo- nial rites, constitutes thei r real majesty and beauty. Masonry combines in itself, a ll that is pure, instructive, humanizing, and worthy of attain ment, in every doctrine taught by the creeds of the past and the present. Its Temple is built upon the solid rock of light and reason; its foundations are deeply laid, its pillars are strong,—Truth, Integrity, Charity and Wisdom. It has endured unshaken for many ages the assaults of bigotry and ignorance, and will doubtless continue firm and majestic for countless ages yet to come. Nearly every popular society of the present day owes its origin and its most valuable knowledge to Masonry; and our Order has spread itself so completely over the earth that it has become almost impossible for any brother to be far distant from some member of the fraternity. How proud should we be, therefore, of its mighty progress and universality, and how strictly should we guard its honour and integrity. Let us so regulate our actions by its noble precepts, that the uninitiated may respect the name of Mason; let us prove by our conduct, not only to each other, but to all men, that our principles are practised and not merely professed; that our being brothers of the Mystic tie does not interfere with 1 [The surface is not so much glowing and brilliant, as a mirror (and a dark mirror at that) in which observers sufficiently skilled in the method of allegorical interpretation will see their own ideas and obsessions reflected back at them.]"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"O FFICIAL G RADES ( 31 °- 33 °) 161 the duties which we owe to society and to our families, as honest law-abiding citizens, sincere and honourable friends, and loving husbands and fathers. Before concluding the lecture of this degree, let us, take a brief retrospective view of those direct organizations which preceded modern Freemasonry. The Egyptian Mysteries are the first of the kind, of which we have any positive and definite information, and on our know- ledge of them are based the ceremonies of our Antient and Primitive Rite, so far as these ancient mysteries are in accordance with the spirit and intelligence of the present day. The Mysteries of the Greeks and Romans were founded on those of Egypt which ranked in antiquity with those of Hindu- stan. By the extension of Christianity, which was the popular development of these societies, and the consequent downfall of the old systems, the persecuted became themselves the perse- cutors, and in their intolerent zeal sought to sweep out of existenee much that was wise, good. and beautiful, with what was erroneous and evil. That, “truth crushed to the earth will rise again,” was verified in this instance, for when the spirit of religious intolerance seemed triumphant, and the countless hordes of Northern barbarians covered the face of Europe, there were many who, faithful to the cause of light and progress, cherished and taught in secret, and in danger, the c1assic literature and moral philosophy of the refined Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. On the return of the Crusaders from their fruitless conflicts with the more highly civilized Saracens, a taste for Oriental science was developed which displayed itself in a passion for Astronomy, Astrology and Alchemy; this favourable opportunity was seized upon by the educated and enlightened of the day, and under the pretence of studying the occult sciences, they prosecuted their researches in philosophy and rational science in undisturbe d safety; they were in constant communication with each other, exchanging experiences, the results of their experiments. and such other information as"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 162 might be to their mutual benefit; thus sprang into life the most wide spread secret societies of the middle ages. From the storehouse of the East came the exhumed treasures of Pagan and early Christian philosophy, which enthusiastic toilers at the printing press scattered broadcast over prolific soil; the Lutheran Heresy in sanctioning the dissemination of the Scriptures in the vulgar tongues, cemented the foundation of modern languages; whilst the teachings of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and the Byzantine Fathers, became favourite dogmas with the erudite and rhetorical schools. During the dawn of resuscitated light. the enlightened conceived the project of discarding their prior subterfuges, under the garb of Alchemy, Courts of Love, Magic, and Rosicrucianism, beneath wh ich they had concealed the prosecution of rational science. Courageous as these men were, they yet dared not openly propagate their doctrines. Could they, with the Inquisition tracking their steps, venture to combat Ecclesiastical Supremacy? Could they, with the sword of King-craft suspended over their heads, advocate emancipa- tion from tyrannical authority? Above all, could they, when Papal Catholicism was the avowed religion of States, incur the certainty of Martyrdom by reviving the ancient mysteries which had been so long obnoxious to the See of Rome? There was one course open to the sagacious sons of light; finding the Hebrew Book of Laws to give a convenient basis for a system of moral discipline alike acceptable to the Israelite, the Christian and the Moslem, they proclaimed to the world that they had combined to re-erect a Mystic Temple, which, though physically extinct, was still capable of symbolic reconstruction; for this purpose, they found th e old organization of the Free- masons ready to their hands, 1 and unwilling to let themselves be identified with the Templars, and other Monkish Knights, 1 [If this means anything, the reference is presumably to the old craft guilds of “operative” masons, who, on the or thodox history of Freemasonry, were transformed over the seventeenth centur y into “speculative” Masonry by the admission of increasing numbers of “a ccepted” members from the aristocracy and middle classes.]"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"O FFICIAL G RADES ( 31 °- 33 °) 163 who had announced themselves as the sworn enemies of the Moors, the persecutors of the Jews, and the oppressors of Christians of low degree, the new Order assumed the symbols of mechanical labour, and beneath this unostentatious guise, sought to unite all mankind in to one harmonious brotherhood, irrespective of religion, race, or privilege. As every religion owns a demi-god, every nation a master, and every faith a legend, our Masons adopted a new version of an ancient symbolical myth, and transformed it into the fable of the Widow’s Son; the outline of whose imaginary martyrdom, co- incides with the fate attributed respectively to Osiris, Hercules, Woden, Jesus of Nazareth, and Arthur Pendragon. By means of this simple narrative, devoid of supernatural and marvellous embellishments, they inculcated the dogma of an identity in all religions; for by whatever name history or fable may designate the demi-gods, Hiram answers for them all, he is the type of a perfect man, a martyr through super-excellence in virtue; who died, arose from the dead and now lives, in life eternal.

But these perjurers have failed to injure the stable fabric of Masonry by their treacherous and cowardly assaults; their villainy has recoiled upon themselves; they have only incurred the contempt and derision of all honest and honourable men, within and without our Order. What can be more sacred than a Masonic obligation? What more binding and impressive? What cause is purer or more philanthropic than Masonry? Whar honest reason can any human being have to betray the ceremonies and harmless mysteries of an Order founded on the grand principles of Love, Truth, Light and Progress? Of what benefit can the treachery be to the traitor himself or the public at large? None. Every effort made to injure the Order, has only exhibited it in a brighter and nobler light to the eyes of the world. In our intercourse with those who are not initiated in to our Rites and Mysteries we can never be too cautious in all matters pertaining to the Order. Many a light and carele ss word may be perverted to our prejudice, and, like falling snow, swell into a mighty avalanche. Let it, then, be our united and individual care that all occasions for prejudice shall be avoided. Many brethren unthinkingly discuss Masonic topics and exchange Masonic signs and greet- ings before cowans and eavesdroppers; this is a fault to which I call your attention in order to im press upon you the necessity of restraining others from such an un-masonic practice, and not thinking that you would be guilty of such negligence. In our intercourse with the world let us carefully guard ourselves against depreciating any brother of the Order, no matter what his faults may be. Let no words of illwill fall from our lips in relation to the members of other Rites.

Let us be careful to remove none of the ancient landmarks; 2 let no ceremony be deprived of its du e solemnity; and let no portion of the ceremonial be curtailed or passed lightly over, but preserved and performed in all its purity and integrity; it is this very thing which constitutes the charm and beauty of this Rite, together with its lessons of high and holy philosophy and progress. I have dwelt, upon these particulars at some length, because this is an official or executive degree. You have already gained all the Masonic light and knowledge known to every Rite in existence, for ours, like the English language. combines the beauty, power and extent of all others. Now that we have gained our journey’s end, climbed the mountain of knowledge, and reached the height of perfection in Masonry, let us look back from an elevated position upon the country through which we have made our pilgrimage; mark its leading features, its sometimes rough and rugged roads, its smiling fertile valleys, its gloomy passes, its sterile deserts, its trials, dangers, and happy termination; from the time when we emerged from the slough of ignorance and darkness, till we basked in the full glory of the sun of Masonry. It is needless to call to your memory the Three primary degrees, common to all Rites, and their allegorical legend of Hiram—his life, death, and resurre ction.

In the Fourth degree, that of Discreet Master, you were intro- duced to the Holy of Holies. Upon your lips was placed the key of silence and upou your brow the square of reason. You beheld the blazing star, the light of the all-seeing eye, and shed tears of regret over the urn which oontained the heart of truth; you bore it to the Sanctuary and were appointed one of the seven who were to supply the pl ace of our murdered Master. In the Fifth degree, that of Sublime Master, you were seized by the Guards as a spy upon the audience chamber of the King and dragged into his presence. Upon its being explained that your intrusion arose from loyalty and zeal and not from idle curiosity, you were released, 1 and permitted to assist in placing the urn in the Mausoleum erected for its reception. You were taught to understand that you were a Son of God, and shared the Divine Love. In the Sixth degree, that of Sacred Arch, you were admitted upon the Sacred Delta applied to your heart. You were led through the nine arches constructed by Enoch, and named Jod, Jaho, Jah, Eleial, Eliah, Joheb, Adonai, Elhannan and Jobel, in the last of which you discovered a pedestal, on which was placed a Delta, the counterpart of one suspended in the Hall of Audience of King Solomon; upon intersecting them they formed a six-pointed star, in the centre of which was discovered the long lost omnific word which was revealed to the Patriarch Enoch before the flood. The legend is symbolical of divine truth. In the Seventh degree, that of Secret Vault you were led into the indiscretion of pronouncing incautiously the word gained in the last degree, and taught discretion in the future.

Our brother remained faithful to his trust, and his dead body was found covering the entrance of the vault where he had concealed the sacred name; upon this the Knights resolved ever again to use the word and gave you one which had been substituted for it. This is the end of all Masonry connected with the Temple of Solomon. In the Eighth degree, Knight of the Sword, is commemorated the return of the Jews from Babylon after a captivity of seventy years. It opens with an interview between Cyrus, King of Persia, and the prophet Daniel, to whom the King relates his dream, 1 and in the interpretation Daniel advises the release of the Jews from their bondage. To this advice, Cyrus consents and presents Zerubbabel with the sword which Nebuchadnezzar received from Jehoiachim, King of Jerusalem, at the time of the captivity, granting him at the same time permission to rebuild the Temple. In the Ninth degree, Knight of Jerusalem, you personated Zerubbabel on his return from the Court of Darius, where he had been to claim the fulfilment of a promise made by the latter, when a private individual, that in case he should become King, he would return all the Holy Vessels of the Temple which had been captured by the Babylonians. Darius propounded this question,—“Which is the strongest; Wine, Women, or the King?” Zerubbabel’s answer was,—“Wine is wicked; Women are wicked; the King is weak, 2 but truth is strong and endureth for ever. There is but one true God, 3 He is the strongest. 1 [This story is not in any of the better known portions of the Book of Daniel ( i.e. those which appear in the Tanakh pl us the episodes of Susannah, Bel and the Dragon, and the other extra chapters in the LXX), but since Daniel is a compilation of the Maccabean period (wit h some parts possibly later still), it may appear in an episode which was not popular enough to get into the final rescension.] 2 [The version of this story in 1 Esdras (the reference to Zerubbabel in which looks like it was grafted on to an earl ier version) has “the king is wicked.”] 3 [His inscriptions strongly suggest th at Darius only acknowledged one God, to wit Ahura Mazda, although as a concession to some of his subjects, some"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 168 Blessed be the God of Truth.” By way of reward, Darius made a decree, and sent you forth with the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other. Upon your arrival you discovered, amongst the rubbish of the Temple, the Sacred Delta of the Secret Vault, and placing it upon the altar you pronounced the name which was once the glory of the temple and nation, and the sacred fire was ignited. This flame is the symbol of eternal truth, which, though hidden and obscured for a time, will eventually shine forth in all its pristine brightness. In the Tenth degree, Knight of the Orient, you were a seeker of the lost word. The grade represents the confederation of the Maccabees, a fraternity, bound by a holy oath; and their sorrow and despair at the death of Judas, the pollution of their Temple, the dispersion of the brethren, and the restoration or the lost and stolen treasures of the Holy Temple. You learn that nothing is really lost to courage and perseverance. In the Eleventh degree, Knight of the Rose Croix, is conclu- ded the degrees of the Chapter and in which symbolical or elementary Masonry is embodied. You sought, in darkness and humility, for the word which had been lost by the spread of superstition; you performed the seven allegorical journies, and learned the new law of love, and that Faith, Hope, and Charity are the principle virtues. You were then led through the abode of sin and death for a period representing three days, and finally discovered the word as the reward of your trials. In the First degree of the Senate of Knight Hermetic Philo- sophers and Twelfth degree of the Rite, Knight of the Red Eagle, you answered three questions; “What is the first great cause? What does man owe to God? What does man owe to his fellows?” You penetrated the bosom of earth; were purified by air, fire and water; drank of the bitter cup; and learned that the true aim of Masonry was,—to revere God, do good to our     rather characterise Ahura as “greatest of the gods.” This by the way makes nonsense of the story in Daniel vi, but then most of the Persian kings were little more than names to the authors of the Book of Daniel.]"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"O FFICIAL G RADES ( 31 °- 33 °) 169 fellow men, and cultivate virtue in all our thoughts and actions. In the Thirteenth , Knight of the Temple, you were proved by the square and compasses forming angles upon your breast and in darkness. You were received upon four points of geometry, formed by the square and compasses, with the letter “G” in the centre. The object of this degree is the propagation of Wisdom, Science and Truth; also a true knowledge of the intellectual or divine geometry, without which all other knowledge is useless. In the Fourteenth degree, Knight of the Tabernacle, is explained the use and nature of the ornaments of the Taber- nacle, the hidden meaning of the banners of the twelve tribes, and of the rites and ceremonies practised in the wilderness, during the Exodus of the Hebrews under the leadership of Moses, the liberator. In the Fifteenth degree, Knight of the Serpent, we have a sequel to the last; it has reference to the Brazen Serpent which Moses erected; and to the serpent worship of various races of antiquity. In the Sixteenth degree, Knight Sage of Truth, you were taught the equality which exists betveen all men, and that true happiness is only found in a strict observance of the moral law, that death is but the dissolution of the body into its component elements, that the Soul can never perish, and that Truth is God. In the Seventeenth degree, Knight Hermetic Philosopher, you were taught the signification of the Hermetic Cross; the degree is a scientific one and treats of the powers and qualities of numbers, plants, and all the natural forces. In the Eighteenth degree, Knight Kadosh, the aim is to dispel ignorance, punish crime, and war against superstition, despotism and tyranny. After many trials you ascended the steps of the Mystic Ladder, indicating,—justice, labour, meekness, fidelity, great labour, patience, generosity, and perfection; you saw that man may fall from the very highest pinnacle of fame to the common level of mankind, with scarce a moment’s warning to prepare him for such a fate. You were"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 170 made conversant with the history of the Crusades, the rise and fall of the Knights Templar, the lamentable fate of the Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, and the retributive justice which followed the three chief assassins. In the Nineteenth degree, Knight of the Royal Mystery, you were instructed in the nine prjncipal faiths of the world by the representive of each religion, and learned Toleration and Charity. In the Twentieth degree, Knight Grand Inspector, you were required to take five different obligations,— 1 st, to the flag of your country; 2 nd, the banner of our Rite; 3 rd, its obligation of secrecy; 4 th, to denounce all Masonic impostors; 1 5 th, implicit obedience to our laws and rules. You were thrice crowned,— 1 st, with the civic crown or wreath of oak leaves, a type of patriotism; 2 nd, with a wreath of cypress, an emblem of death and eternity; 3 rd, with a wreath of roses, as a symbol of peace and happiness. With undaunted courage you confronted many perils; the sad remains of moul dering mortality; braved the ordeal of fire, and plucked from the vessel of molten lead the ring of perfection which is the symbol of Masonic truth and Knightly valour. 2 You drank life from death, and learned the grand mystery, that all things live, die, and revive again. This is the last of the Senate degrees, and concludes the intellectual series of our Rite. In the First degree of the Sublime Council and Twenty-first degree of the Rite, Grand lnstallator, you were instructed in symbolism, and were qualified to perforrn the Public Cere- monial of Installation. 1 [Many Masonic historians would include the Antient and Primitive Rite, with its ludicrous claims of antiquity, its arrogant claims to incorporate every- thing of value in all Masonic rites, an d its constant sniping at, or outright denunciation of, other rites and th eir members, under this head.] 2 [The “vessel of molten lead” is a pot of quicksilver; the only danger to the Can. is of poisoning by mercury vapour if some idiot heats it up to make the trial more “realistic.” A version of this sham ordeal appears in the earliest known version of Sovereign Grand Inspector 33 ° (as published in a volume titled Ordo ab Chao ) and was retained in some later revisions.]"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"O FFICIAL G RADES ( 31 °- 33 °) 171 In the Twenty-second degree, Grand Consecrator, you were instructed upon the Mystic Temple, Sapenath Pencah, and qualified to perform the Public Ceremonial of Consecration. In the Twenty-third degree, Grand Eulogist, you were instruc- ted in the ancient faith of the immortality of the soul, and qualified to perform the Ceremonial funeral rites. These last three grades, are official ceremonies. In the Twenty-fourth degree, Patriarch of Truth, you sought the Fountain of Perfect Light, and an insight into the mysteries of unrevealed science. You pa ssed through the black gloom of horror and despair, and your eyes beheld the symbol of the Holy One. You plucked the Key of Zeus from the cauldron of boiling oil, and learned, by experience, the nature of that mighty power which pervades space, and is the source of all vitality. In the Twenty-fifth degree, Patriarch of the Planispheres, you learned the true import of the Masonic Globes, and the allegorical nature of the twelve signs of the Zodiac were explained to you. In the Twenty-sixth degree, Patriarch of the Sacred Vedas, was fully explained the leading tenets of the Eastern Theologies, as inculcated in the Sacred Vedas, the Laws of Manu, and the Ramayana of the Brahmins; the laws and treatises of Buddha, and the Zend Avesta of Zoroaster; the moral taught is that we should never condemn unheard, but examine, reflect and tol- erate. These last three grades are schools of instruction, which are preparatory to the Egyptian Rites of the Sublime Council. In the Twenty-seventh degree, Patriarch of Isis, you were instructed in the morality, ceremo nials, and many perils, of the Lesser Mysteries :of the Egyptians at Memphis. As Thales, the ancient philosopher, you visited the Temple of Symbols, situ- ated upon an island in the Lake Mœris, saw the wonders of the far-famed Labyrinth, and were then admitted to the Inner Temple, where you had imparted to you a full knowledge of the language of symbols. You learned that Isis, Queen of Heaven,"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"M ASONIC C HARGES AND L ECTURES 172 wife of the demi-god Osiris, and mother of the child Horus, symbolises fruitful nature. In the Twenty-eighth degree, Patriarch of Memphis, is given a concise history of Osiris, and a dramatic representation of his birth, life, death and resurrection, as compared with that of all ment of which the sun is a sublime symbol. This legend embodies the return of Osiris from the countries he had visited as a missionary of civilization, his murder by his unnatural brother Typhon, the recovery of his body from the waters of the Nile, its interment, the desecrat ion of his grave, his descent into Amenthean purgatory and fina l resurrection. It is a cere- monial of the Greater Mysteries, and teaches us that religion, like history, repeats itself. In the Twenty-ninth degree, Patriarch of the Mystic City, the beautiful allegorical story of Osiris is continued, a belief in the unity of Deity is impressively inculcated, three great secrets are given to you, after having once more passed through the Valley of Death. A brief mention is ma de of the several rites in exis- tence, which, it is shewn, are derived from our own Primitive Institution. In the Thirtieth degree, Perfect Pontiff—Sublime Master of the Great Work, you reached the Apex of Masonic Perfection, and the whole system of Antient and Primitive Masonry was unfolded to you in all its perfec ted sublimity and grandeur. You passed safely through the Pronaos, and the Sanctuary of Spirits, to the Hall of Truth, where you underwent the great Egyptian Judgment; were crowned with the triple coronet as an emblem of life, death and resurrection; partook of our communion of brotherhood—bread, the staff of life, and wine, the blood of nature. So closes the Theosophical or Celestial teaching of our rite. In the last three Official grades, which you have now received, we have but a repetition of our principal dogmas. In the First of them, you are impressed with lessons of Justice and Morality. In the Second with the Unity of Deity. This, the Third, is"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"O FFICIAL G RADES ( 31 °- 33 °) 173 intended to remind you of the life to come, where we hope to enjoy with kindred Spirits, a happy and glorious immortality. And now, after this review of the journey which we have completed together, can you concei ve any system which is more concise, complete, or connected than that of our rite; compre- hending as it does the wisdom and philosophy of all nations and races, since the dawn of hist ory; inculcating the purest morality, and the ever enduring principles of natural religion and reason, it stands paramount above all other systems. There is not one word or ceremony in its whole course that is anta- gonistic to the true, the pure and the sacred. The Mason who lives according to its spirit and instruction, cannot be other than a good, just, and upright man, in every relation of life. Let it be our constant study to attain this pefection, so that when we are summoned from this earthly Lodge, we may be found worthy aud well qualified to take our place in that Celestial Lodge, over which T.S.A.O.T.U. rules now and for ever-more So mote it be. o"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"174 A note on the assignment of the discourse to degrees. 4 ° ( Discreet Master ): Masonic Science as Related to the Temple of Jerusalem.

These Lectures are translated from the published work s of Jacques Etienne Marconis, a volumnious writer of whom any So ciety may well be proud; much of them are, however, the production of last century and used in the old Rites. They are not, strictly speaking, a portion of the secret ceremonial of the Higher Degrees, and may therefore be offered to any Master Mason. 1 °. They show what, is expected of the Masonic Neophyte who knocks at the door of ourTemple, whether as a Master Mason, Knight Rose Croix, or Grand Inspector. 2 °. They will be useful to the expert Master in Chapters, Senates and Councils, or the instruction of his members when there is no other pressing business. 3 °. As many of these questions and answers have been struck out of the ceremonial in order to shorten the Ritual, they may be drawn upon by the presiding officer to test the mental capabilities of the Aspirant. Lastly, as they embrace all High Grade Masonry, they will be found a source of interest to the members of several other systems; for there is now in practice over the two hemispheres about a score of divergent Rites, all branching from the Master Mason, and which the Antient and Primitive Rite designed to fuse into one system as a Common Temple, under one Lord, the Grand Master and Maker of us all. With the system of adoptive Masory, which has never been worked in this country and is th ought objectionable to its social features, our Antient and Primitive Members will be in possession of everything that Masonry can teach them, and such only can claim to be Perfect Masters.

Are you a Discreet Master? A. I have shed tears with the Brethren at the grave where the Sprig of Myrtle was placed. Q. How were you received as a Discreet Master? A. My lips were locked with the Key of science. I had a Square upon my forehead, and a pair of Compasses in my hand. Q. What did you perceive at your entrace? A. Evident marks of the Divine Presence, by which I was seized with wonder. Q. Why were you seized with wonder? A. On beholding a portion of the beauty and ornarnents of the Temple. Q. Why did you not see the whole? A. A part was concea led from my view by a thick veil, but I prayed that the zealous desire which I had to improve in the Royal Art would disperse the cloud which obstructed my sight. Q. After that did you distinguish anything particular? A. I beheld a great serpent forming a circle enclosing a triangle, in the centre of which was a luminous circle enclosing a blazing star, from which proceeded nine beams of light; my eyes were dazzled and my mind filled with holy respect and contemplation. Q. What was enclosed in the brightness of this emblem? A. The triangle held the great Ineffable name. In the centre of the blazing star was enshrined the letter G.

Q. What more did you see? A. The Ark of Alliance, the golden candlestick with seven branches, the table with shew-bre ad, and the altar of incense. Q. Where were they placed? A. In the middle of the S.S. 1 Q. Of what form was the Ark? A. An oblong square; it wa s made of shittim wood lined with gold both within and without, having a golden crown supported by two cherubims of gold. Q. What was the purpose of the Table? A. It was used to contain the 12 loaves of shew-bread. They were made of the finest flour, and placed into two heaaps of 6 on the right side, and 6 on the left, and were covered with a pure and bright ewer, as an ornament to the obligation made with God. Q. Describe the Candlestick. A. It was composed of seven branches to represent the planets; on each branch was placed a lamp pointing north and south. It typifies the Holy Spirit in the heart of those who faithfully observe the law. Q. Are you a Sublime Master? A. I have assisted at the obsequies of the Illustrious Dead. Q. What lesson have you learnt from this degree? A. To regulate my morals, and cleanse my heart from all stain, in order to qualify myself for the degree of perfection at which I hope some day to arrive. Q. What is the meaning of a Square Stone containing the letter Jod in the centre of three circles? A. It teaches us that the foundation of our building must 1 [Sanctum Sanctorum ( Lat ., “Holy of Holies”).]"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"FIRST SERIES , SECTION I ( COLLEGE ) 181 be laid on the living rock of wh ich we were originally formed.

What do the two pyramids on your draft represent, of which one is South and the other North? A. The two pyramids represent Egypt, where the sciences were much cultivated. Q. What do you learn from the three first degrees? A. The first teaches moral virtue; the second political virtue; the third heroic virtue. Q. Where was the Jewel of our Grand Master found? A. It was found in a well in the north part of the Temple, where H.A. must have thrown it when attacked. Q. What does the left side of the Temple signify? A. Masonry under the law of types and ceremonies. Q. And the right side? A. Masonry under the law of grace and truth. Q. What does the tomb signify? A.

The English Royal Arch degree, which is considered a part of the ceremony of a Master Mason, has for jewel, a double triangle within a circle, containing a triple tau in the centre. Q. What is the derivation and characteristics of the English Royal Arch Degree? A. It is first heard of by name amongst the dissidents calling themselves Ancient Masons; but is evidently alluded to by a Rosicrucian writer in the mystic language of those occultists, in a publication dedicated to the Grand Lodge of England in 1721 ; and appears to be again referred to as the “fifth order” in 1725 . We hear of it in lreland in 1743 as consisting of three grades and worked at York. It was a grade only conferred upon the Masters of Lodges or those who had by passing the chair degree received brevet rank. It had three steps, of which the two first were called Excellent, and Super- Excellent, and referred to the revelation of the Sacred Name to Moses, and detailing how So lomon discovered the sacred emblem of the degree, and the manner in which it was again brought to light at the building of the Second Temple. The"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"FIRST SERIES , SECTION I ( COLLEGE ) 183 presiding officers, at one time, represented S.K.I., H.K.T. and H.A.B.; 1 but the Officers of the Royal Arch of the Second Temple were a High Priest, a Prophet, and a King. There is no allusion to the secrets of the degree in old MSS., and it was essentially Rosicrucian; upon it was added the Templar and Templar Priest, which is a degree of philosophical Christianity professing to date from the “Year of Revival, or 1686 .” Q. What signifies the Sacred Name? A. Etymologists teach that the name signifies, that which is; and this explanation is conformable to the sense of the Bible, which causes God to say, “I am that I am.” It is, in fact, the only name we can give to God, who is the Being by his own essence, without beginning or end, the necessary cause of all existence; which metaphysicians believe, because nothing can exist without cause; which the man of observation perceives because the magnificence and order of the universe proves a sovereign intelligence, creator an d ordainer; which the Moralist believes, because there is a natural law at the bottom of all hearts, the universal consience of the just and unjust, making the sentiment of all who reject chance as a dry and absurd idea. A cabalistical symbol has been framed, which expresses the name of T .S.A.O.T .U. in this manner, y , whilst we find in this symbol the sacred letter J, with the divine accents which enter into the word Jehovah, their disposition forms a delta, or triangle, which again is one of the signs by which divinity is designated. The incomprehensible name of God was one of the Mysteries of the inner Temple of Memphis and Heliopolis, and we are not very certain of its pronunciation. The Grand Hiero- phant alone had permission to pronounce it once in each year on the day of Expiation, and the Levites, by the noise which they made at this moment, prevented its being heard by the multitude. Students have pushed enquiries into this name until they affect to have discovered the demonstration and positive 1 [Standard Masonic abbrevia tions for Solomon King of Israel, Hiram King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, the three Masters in the Craft legend.]"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 184 expression of the Trinity, finding three other names and one sole essence in the word Jehova h. These cabalists draw four cicles, of which two are great and concentric, and the other two, of which the centre is upon the circumference of the interior circle; in each of the little circles are placed two letters of the word as if there was one in each hemisphere; then by joining the jod to the first he , you have one of the names of God, the Generator; by joining the first he with the vau , you have another name of God, the engendered word; by joining the vau with the second he you have a third name, which proceeds from the first and second; lastly, as all are united in the great name you find three in one. Q. What signifies the Tau Cross of this grade? A. Amongst the Egyptians it forrned an instrument to mea- sure the rise of the river Nile; the Greeks used it in ornament- ation; edifices consecrated to religious worship were disposed in the cross form; it was an emblem of the four cardinal points; surmounted with the endless circle it signified eternal life. Q. What does the Apron signify? A. It is an emblem of equality. Q. What signifies the decoration of the Alidee? A. Truth; it was an Egyptian decoration. Q. How do you name the place where the Sacted Delta was found? A. Endymion; which signifies grotto, or vault. Q. Give a precise idea of the Arch degree. A. It is consecrated to courage and constancy in the search for truth, and has some affinity with architecture. It is the best type which we can present to those who have been taught that this Royal Art is a symbol of that intellectual architecture which consists in making for ourselves a temple worthy of the mission which we have received from the Author of Nature.

The degree is possessed of such signs as are found in the Bible, and in the traditions of several ancient people. It possesses a delta bearing that sacred name which was discovered in the profundity of the earth. It symbol- ises to us that it is necessary to face many dangers in order to find science, and that after long and painful search. Q. What does the Delta signify? A. The unity of the Godhead. Truth ought only to be presented to those who are capable of comprehending it. Q. Has any one essayed to dig in these ruins? A. Ambitious and jealous Masons have penetrated these ruins and perished there. Science, the source of all good things, is an instrument which is fatal to all those who have cultivated it from motives of pride, and without pure and benevolent intentions. Q. To what does the instruction of the principal Arch degrees allude? A. To Enoch and his dream; to the Nine Arches which en- shrined the Sacred Delta upon which reposed the Ineffable Word. In England, the present Royal Arch degree refers to the second Temple, and has affinity with the degree of Knight of the Sword or Red Cross of Babylon. In some rites, both ancient and modern, we find Seven Door s, which symbolise the Seven Planets; and having the mystic words, Beababa, resignation; Mothak, sweetness; Serrel, intelligence; Emounah, strength; Coh-er-Eloah, love of God; Tsedakah, justice. Q. What did the ancients believe in regard to these seven doors? A. The Egyptian Initiates believed that the soul was immortal, and in the ascent to the Halls of Osiris, that it was necessary to pass through seven doors which, in the practice of the Mysteries were composed of lead, tin, iron, copper, bronze, silver and gold, and as such referred to Saturn, Jupiter, Mer- cury, Venus, Mars, Moon and Sun.

It is the seven-stepped ladder of our Masonic degrees. Q. On what is the constitution of the Order founded? A. Upon the law of Hom. According to the Zend Avesta, this law announced an eternal Supreme Being, originating two opposing principles; the ceremonies of the law called Paeriokesh were very simple, recalling the origin and arrangement of the Universe; their am being to render homage to T.S.A.O.T.U., and elevate man above his kind by defending him from the passions which so often trouble his existence.

A. The mirror is an emblem of truth. The Ark represents the soul agitated upon a sea of passions and escaping a deluge of vices. Q. What symbolises the ch andelier of three branches? A. The triple luminous nature of the Divinity—wisdom, justice, goodness. Q. You ought to have remarked two emblems, the circle and the square ; will you give us the explanation? A.

Q. And the two circles in which are indicated two principles —Divinity and Nature? A. Both are synonymous; for all nature submits to an organised and periodical movement; impressing us with the existence of a great First Cause, who attracts our veneration and compels us to think that nothing can be above Him. Q. What is indicated by the emblems of the Sun and Moon? A. The sun is an emblem of the sacred fire which ought to warm our soul and enlighten our spirit. The moon symoblises the earth the mother and nourisher of men and things; its borrowed light invites us to profit by that light which is given to us, but to receive it with discernmemt and to adopt nothing but what is conformable to sound philosophy, and the pure morality of which Masonry is the focus. Q. What is signified by the Dove? A. It is an emblem of the vivifying spirit which fertilises nature. The image of the universal spirit that illuminates the three stages of nature—the animal, vegetable, and mineral. Q. Give me an explanation of the seven planets known to the ancients? A. The Sun represents Apollo, the god or light, sciences and arts; it indicates morally the first glimmer of celestial light. The Moon represents the goddess Diana , sister of Apollo, it being the nocturnal light and the darkness of intelligence. Mars , god of wars and combats, presides over battles; Masons should combat vice. Mercury is the interpreter of divine light; he carries the caduceus of eloquence and truth. Jupiter , master of the gods, is the emblem of intelligence and divine power. Venus , goddess of beauty and mother of love, leading to fertility. Saturn , god of time, destroying and renwing each day; the ancients represented him as devouring his children—the days thrown behind him."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 188 Q.

The seven principal passions of life— 1 st, Propagation; 2 nd, Acquisition; 3 rd, Scientific Ambition; 4 th, Civil Ambition; 5 th, Family Ambition; 6 th, Social Pleasures; 7 th, Religion. Also the seven heavens, or spheres, which again symbolise the seven corporeal delights—seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting, tranquility, thought. Q. What does the word of initiation imply? A. It implies birth to a new life: the profane man, in order to be admitted to our sublime in stitution, must abandon errors, prejudlcies, and principally vici ous habits, and the defects con- tracted in the world. Q. What signifies the Mallet in the hands of the Master? A.

A Mason who having worked in the lower degrees of initiation, raises himself to the study of the primitive forces of nature, and gives himself up to search for second causes. Q. Why is the Most Wise sometimes called Thirsata, or Athirsata. A. The word is translated by cup-bearer. The Knights Rose Croix look on themselves as holding that dignity to T.S.A.O.T.U. Q. What is the mission of the Knjghts Rose Croix? A. They are charged with the conservation of the sacred fire of symbolicaI Masonry, and to remind the brethren that our dogmas, mysteries, and philosophical grades, embrace the study of nature and the sublime sciences, obtaining order, bene- ficence and probity. Q. What signifies darkness succeded by a brilliant light; the word lost and found; the instruments of labour broken and in confusion? A. They symbolise discouragement replaced by alacrity and labour, the triumph of good over evil, truth over error, faith enlightening the superstition and misery of mankind in their uncivilised state, and their amelioration and advancement. Q. What signifies the voyages of the candidate? A. The efforts required for the acquisition of science and the augmentation of the treasure of knowledge; they are the transient symbol of this labour, and indicate that we ought to employ every moment actively in order to render them useful. Q. What does the flaming star with the letters J.H.V.H. indicate?"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 190 A.

Q. What signifies the Rose and Cross in combination? A. The rose signifies the brilliant productions of imagination and poesy, and by its alliance with the cross it expresses the mixed nature of life , with its joys and pleasures; the combined symbol indicates that our pleasures, to be sweet, should have delicacy, and that th ey are of short duration when we deliver ourselves to excess. Q. What signifies the Pelican? A. The pelican is the emblem of death and perpetual rebirth of Nature; it represents the earth which nourishes its children, a mother who fulfils her sacred duties, a good father to his family, a charitable brother. Q. What is concealed under the fable of the Phœnix? A. According to profane tradition this mysterrious bird, after a life of 1261 years, 1 arrived from the East, entered the venerated Temple of Heliopolis and alighted upon the altar; placing itself upon a pile of myrtle and incense, it expired in the midst of the flames, but as soon as its body was reduced to ashes it was gloriously reborn, and laun ching itself to new life, winged its way to the West, to return periodically, after each series of 1261 years, to die upon the same alta r. In its general significance this fable was an emblem of immo rtality; but it indicated, more especially, the coincidence of the rising of Sothis, or Sirius, with the first day of the month Thoth, that it to say the commence- ment of the Sothic period or Sothic Cycle. 1 [If it really was a mythical type of the so-called Sothic Cycle, 1261 is an error for 1461 ; but owing to the effects of precession the actual period between successive occasions when the heliacal rising of Sirius as seen at Heliopolis (or any other given point in Eg ypt) occurs on the first of the month Thoth will be a few decades less than this. Other accounts give the Phœnix period variously as 340 , 460 , 500 , 600 or 7006 years.]"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"FIRST SERIES , SECTION II ( CHAPTER ) 191 Q. What signification is attached to the Cross? A. The Cross represents the tree of Science. Q. Explain the three columns which you encountered. A. The first is that of Faith ; but not that blind and super- stitious faith which abdicates re ason and rejects all examination for reason is the most delightful of the gifts which the Deity has made to man; it teaches, rather, that intimate conviction of eternal truth which attracts us to all that is good and beautiful, noble and generous; to have a filial confidence in the Supreme goodness of God, who sometimes passes men through the crucible of misfortune in order to render them better; that faith of heart which never deceives us, conducts us to virtue, happiness and the delight which good actions procure. The second column is that of Hope ; it symbolises the courage which is necessary to a man who labours for the good of humanity. God has placed hope in our souls to sustain us in all our troubles; it is rccommended to us by the sign which we make, when we raise the eyes to heaven to ask T.S.A.O.T.U. for strength to vanquish our passions and march without obstacle in the sentiments of virtue. The third column is that of Charity; this divine virtue symbolises goodness. that which is God-like, an emanation of T.S.A.O.T.U.; by it equality is not a vain word but a sacred right; a consoling angel, it lessens the evils endured by the rich, the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the suffering and aged; it sustains and consoles the unfortunates who are abandoned and expiriing upon a bed of grief, and who by sublime inspiration raise themselves to the eternal.

A. Thirty-three years; it is the age of the perfection of human life. Q. Give the battery. A. ( He gives it ); 4 it symbolises the seven cyclical periods of the Creation of the Universe. Q. What signifies the Book of True Light, upon which rests a lamb holding with one foot a triumphal banner? A. The Stekunna symbolises the resurrection, or regeneration of the sun, by its victory over the frosts of winter, through the renewal of the vigour of this star. This Book can only be fully understood by the learned, because of the allegories, mysteries and symbols which it contains, and of which one can only acquire a complete understan ding by means of the seven sciences, which are emblematically pointed out to us by the seven seals of the Book, above all by Astronomy, which is symbolised by the triumphant lamb. Q. What else is signified by the seven seals? 1 [Presumably, as in other Rose-Cro ix versions, I.N.R.I. exchanged by letters.] 2 [Information not recoverable immediately.] 3 [The word is probably E MMANUEL and the reply P AX VOBISCUM .] 4 [ wwwwww w , probably.]"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"FIRST SERIES , SECTION II ( CHAPTER ) 193 A. The seven qualities which ought to distinguish a Mason, viz: Friendship, union, submission, discretion, fidelity, prudence and temperance; they also typify the seven eyes or divine providence ever watchful to promote the welfare of His creatures. Q. Why is the Neophyte received in darkness? A. It represents our grief at the loss of the word; and points out, moreover, that man arrives at final initiation only by death. Q. What is the origin of our ceremonial Agapæ ? A. These symbolical festivals are of the highest antiquity. Every year the statue of Ammon was carried to the confines of Egypt and Ethiopia, when the priests of both nations conjointly offered a sacrifice and celebrated the triumph of light over darkness, by a sacred festival, termed by the Greeks Heliotroper (table of the sun). They had also an humiliation before the entrance of the sun into the sigh of the Lamb ( 25 th March) for the loss of vegetation, followed by a season of rejoicing, for 40 days, on its renewal, and lasting until the rising of the Pleiades. The Agapæ were held by the first Christians, as well as the Lenten lamentation and rejoicing. Q. What was the motive in rendering homage to the Sun? A. The sun is the symbol of life. It embellishes and decor- ates nature; to it we owe the fire of imagination, sallies of spirit, sublimity of thought, profundity of judgement, all of which characterises the intelligence with which man is endowed; it is the sun which forms, mixes, perpetuates, multiplies and destroys, in order to give a new and more perfect form than the first. Q. Where were these festivals held? A. In the Island of Meroe, the sojourn of the Gymnosophists; they assembled to praise God, and eat in common that which had been ble ssed by the priests, irrevocably after the first moon which followed the spring equinox; and to this we owe the Masonic Agapæ .

The aim of the Agapæ was to strentgthen the bonds of brotherly love between the initiates. Q. What signifies the Mystic Point in the Rose Croix degree? A. It refers to the ancient times of simplicity and good faith; when men ate and drank together in order to strengthen the bonds which should unite them, and by being united, to exorcise the evils which ignorance and perversity incessantly produce. Q. What is the aim of the Most Wise in his prayers to T.S.A.O.T.U.? A. To beseech the Supreme Being, who has created light and truth, to guide men towards justice and friendship in order to render them happy. He, it is, who judges the heart, gives joy to the hood and remose to the wicked. Q. What is the origin of the Masonic Signs? A. The Masonic signs reach to the highest antiquity. We find Abrasax with the emblem of the Eternal Father having the arms crossed in the Good-pastor sign; 1 others of the Gnostic gems have others of our Signs. The Hierophants of Heliopolis went out of the Temple carrying always their hands as the Modern Masons do when they stand to order; the Essenes, who were a branch of the Egyptian Priests, made the same sign when addressing their Masters in assembled Chapter. Q. What is the aim of our ancient and venerated institution? A. The fusion of all religious belief; to reunite all men in a single bond; teaching that there is but one vital essence, but one soul-nature, but one divine breath. Q. In what way do the Knights Rose Croix consider men and things? 1 [Also called the Sign of the Good Sh epherd or Pastor; arms crossed on breast, left over right, hands open; it is a commonplace stance of Egyptian figures, although the stereotyped figures on the “Abrasax” gems (see King, Gnostics and their Remains , for many examples), are more usually depicted with arms outspread, one holding a wh ip or sword, the other a shield.]"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"FIRST SERIES , SECTION II ( CHAPTER ) 195 A. By the councils of reason; they consider things in all their bearings and find the greatest good where there is the least evil; they look upon man as nature made him; endowed with contrary qualities; they ob serve not his imperfections, and disdain none who merit attachme nt; they fear no evil and expect no more than is reasonable. Supported by such maxims the Knight Rose Croix is no longer the play of passions and uncertainties; he reflects on a ll his actions, that he may place them in accord with reason and virtue, submitting with resignation to the evils inseperable from existence, to the rapid succession of happy or unhappy events, to the phenomena of nature; he regards time which drags all onwards as the greatest consoler; he never forgets that being a wonderful combination of matter and spirit these two elements of his being are both in mutual action. Q. What signifies the upturned tree? A. It symbolises the world, which in ancient tradition is represented by this symbol, conformably to a passage in the Vedas which says: “The world, eternal figure,launches its roots in the heavens, and extends its branches to the abyss.” Q. What signifies the Armillary Sphere? A. It is the emblem of the exact sciences, the object of our studies. Q. Of what is the Eagle and emblem? A.

The square symbolises Nature and the four elements. The circle the eternal succession of life. Q. What does the Red-cross symbolise? A. It is an emblem of the life to come; the origin of this cross is of the highest antiquity; it is found in the sacred letters of the Egyptians (after Suedos); the Imperial ensigns, bucklers and other arms repeat this ornament as a sign of immortality; it is placed with the ring-handle in the hands of the immortals. The Cross was found in the foundations of the temple of Osiris. It is an ancient symbol amongst the Indians. Q. Of what form is the Masonic Temple? A. It forms a cube corresponding to the number four, the symbol of nature; there are four elements, four cardinal points, and all the interior dispositions attach to the same system. The number four symbolises the principal duties,—Brotherly love, relief, truth, and to do unto others as we would they should do unto us. Q. What do we understand here by the Philosopher’s Stone? A. The art of being resigned to misfortune, the wise joys of good fortune, and to repair faults by a wise and regular conduct. Q. Where can man best find that which is necessary to his education? A. In his own nature; he finds in his body the motive strength of his physical perfection; he finds in his soul the principle of his religious and in tellectual perfection; he finds them in his faculties, morality and religion, and in his body their basis. Q. How can we best raise the dignity of man? A. It is necessary to consider his existence as divine; that is to say, as sacred and inviolablehe ought, therefore, to estimate and respect himself as a sacred being, and in that quality do nothing but what tends to elevate his nature. The Mason who"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"FIRST SERIES , SECTION II ( CHAPTER ) 197 understands his interior and divin e nature ought to understand the first cause of his being; that cause is God; as God is in us, and as our soul is the image of the divine intelligence, there is nothing outside man essential for his perfection. Q. Who is the Most Wise of men? A. He who knows himself, who comprehends his interior and divine nature, and who feels, thinks, and acts in conformity with that knowledge. He who knows the strength of his body and the faculties of his soul, how to develop and perfect them, by the use of his sense and reason, and to employ and direct them towards his good, acquires the knowledge of himself. Q. In what consists the true education of the human soul? A. In forming itself for immortality; man ought not onlv to form himself for the present life, but for the future; for that would only be an educ ation of which the fruits would not extend beyond this life. Ought I, therefore, to form myself for life or for death? What will my educatio n serve me if it is only for death? Nothing. Education is the art of forming the life, not for a moment but for eternity. Q. How ought we to form our souls? A. The soul which forms itself for this life, ought to acquire the highest strength of which it is susceptible in order to direct a mortal body; it should learn to resist the elements, vanquish griefs, and surmount all obstacles encountered in the road of life; to command itself in orde r to vanquish the passions and triumph over vice. Q. In what consists the education of the human heart? A. In knowing how to form it self for the love of mankind; the soul follows the understanding, and in order to know love as well as friendship, it is necessary to be enlightened by the light of the Spirit..

Q. Is the nature of the soul essentially intelligent? A. Man is not only a physical but he is also a sensible being, moral and intelligent, capable of sentiment, of love of conception and reasoning. The heart loves, the spirit conceives, the intelligence understands and reasons. Q. What is reason? A. Reason is the faithful guide of man; we ought to consult it in all the affairs of moral and civil life if we do not wish to be misled. Reason enlightens us and causes us to know the exis- tence of T.S.A.O.T.U. and His perfections; the immortality of the soul; the existence of a law engraven on our hearts which causes us to feel what is just and honest. The holiness of a law consists in this, that it inspires us with sentiment of natural justice towards God, towards ou rselves, and towards mankind, to love our neighbours and offend no one, to render to each that which belongs to him, to flee vice and practice virtue. Q. What do you understand by philosophy? A. The love of wisdom; the science of principles, the know- ledge of truth, embracing in its generality all the laws of the physical and moral world. Q. And eclectic philosophy? A. It tends to the choice of whatever is best and most cer- tain, in the different philosophic al systems, without attaching itself exclusively to any; it is composed as much of the peculiar philosophies as there are diverse science. Q. And Hermetic philosophy? A. This philosophy professed to aim at making gold and prolonging life beyond the ordinary limits of human nature. Q. And Scholastic philosophy? A. Principally an exercise upon religious ideas. Q. And Theosophic philosophy? A. It is the science of God. The Masons of the anterior grades believe in God from sentiment by the consideration of His works; those of the high-grades ought to be in a state of"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"FIRST SERIES , SECTION II ( CHAPTER ) 199 reason and belief, and ought to share their knowledge with the others. It is necessary to know physical causes, metaphysics and morals upon which to support faith in a Supreme Being, the principal attributes of this being, His providence, that is to say, the action of His power, His intelligence and goodness in the government of the world, the end which is proposed in the plan of the universe; thus it seeks to refute objections drawn from bad physics and bad morals; in short, Theosophy applies to moral considerations as a positive science. Q. And Psychology? A. It is the science of the soul; the proof of its immortality, its faculties, the conscience, ideas, reasn, liberty of choice between good and evil. Q, Do you believe that it is in the obscurity of night that immortality is revealed to man? A. Yes, for is not the sight of the heavenly bodies on a beautiful njght calculated to in spire high thoughts upon the immensity and harmony of the universe and upon man himself. The proof of the existence of an intelligent cause is to be found in those marvels of nature, in those infinite stars which roll over our heads, the regularity of their course and the effect of several of them upon the globe which we inhabit. Q. In what ends this contemplation? A. The enjoyment of the benefits of nature, and the eager search for the spiritual nourishment destined for the soul to profit by, for man lives not by bread alone, but by the word which instructs him and renders him better. Q. How do you look upon the conscience? A. As the intimate tabernacle which encloses the human soul, the book of the law, the im age of the sun. Under the phy- sical affinity—intellectual and moral—the sun is the sensible image of the divinity; the emblem of the warmth of the soul and the light of the Spirit. Masonry ought to perform in the moral order, the same good that the su n does in the physical order. Q. Do you understand the art of prolonging life?"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 200 A. Yes, it consists in frugality and temperance. The dietetic rules of Orpheus and the frugivorous rule of Pythagoras are the best by which to reach a long life. The strongest men and those who lived the longest used this diet; for the ancient heroes, sages and legislators had no other, and all made it a sacred law. From the examples transmitted to us by history we learn that the first men lived only upon the fruits which the earth produced of itself. Their life was so long that they thought the body as well as the soul would have been immortal if man had not degenerated. To follow a simple and regular mode of life, rise with the sun, work with moderation, take reasonable repose, cleanliness and activity, cold baths, and above all cheerfulness. Q. How do you define man’s nature? A. Man is an organised intelligence, submitting by his nature, to complex needs of two sorts; his first nature is soul, which aspires continually after sp iritual nourishment; the other is more gross, involving all the in firmities of a limited existence, and causing him to direct his powers to satisfy his material appetites. Q. Explain the transitions which unite the Kingdoms of Nature? A. Coral and moss are intermediate between the mineral and the plant; the polypus between the vegetable and the animal; the ape between the brute and man; woman between man and the angels, for her soul is the most perfect of the immaterial essences which animate organised matter; the woman is man and angel combined, her superior magnetic virtues, render her at times a citizen of both worlds. Q. What was the first language of man? A. The most universal, energetic, and the only language primarily needed to persuade assemblies of men was the cry of nature and humanity; when he beheld for the first time the beauties of nature, the order of the universe and harmony of all existence, he had different sensations, he thought, he admired,"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"FIRST SERIES , SECTION II ( CHAPTER ) 201 was astonished, and the primitive expressions of what he welt was,—Ah! Oh! Q. How in these primitive times did man proceed to create language? A. In order to create it they had but to do in general that which each man did in particular; to exercise the order of speech so as to be able to express sentiments, thoughts, ideas, and sensations; they then named beings and signified things; they represented substances and their quaiities by words; then analysed. composed, and decomposed language, and finished it in all its parts. During the lapse of time, mankind found them- selves divided by the revolutions of the globe, and so the first tribes provided with the elemen ts of the primitive language created a particular language. Hence diverse languages are de- rived from the primitive langua ge. The name which all people have given to lhe Supreme Being is alone a proof of this:— Theos, Deus, Dai, Dalai, Adonai, Achina, Amida,Amida, Anuto, Tyo, Tien, Oroo, Aramaze, Osiris, Jovis, Jehovah, Bova, Boza, Gott, God, Dio, Dios, Eternal, S.A.O.T.U.,—all these names have a striking resemblance, and are found in the five parts of the world. This analogy and resemblance exists between the names which men and people have given to nature, heaven, earth, sea, to the more common animals, to man, and above all to father and mother; it is the same with all the names that represent qualities, as beauty, goodness, truth, virtue; moreover man has pictures, by analogous sounds, the nature of objects and the qualities which are inherent in them. By ascending to the origin of all languages in a comparative etymo- logical analysis, and to the primitive roots which compose them, we could recover the radical root-words of the primitive language, and recognise the causes leading to this conformity of principles, thoughts, and ideas which we remark amongst all peoples. Q. Has a perfect language been arrived at by any nation? A. The most perfect of the languages has been created by"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 202 the Greeks; it is the most beautiful and harmonious language which has been spoken; it is this , almost divine, language which has distinguished human nature in that which is most doable, and left us the celestial idea of true beauty, and of that which is sublime in its full perfection; it has transmitted to us their ideas of the fine arts and the elements of all the Sciences; hence we may call it the language of huma n wisdom or of perfect human- ity. The most perfect language in Metaphysics and Psychology is the more ancient Sanskrit. Q. Can a perfect language establish a general fraternity? A. Yes, the use of speech implies a tacit promise to speak the truth, a convention common to all men, a species of divine right for man to communicate his ideas. It is by learning his native language that man learns to think, judge, reason, to understand his own sentiments and those of others, to purify, to aggrandise, to enlighten, to raise and extend his ideas. It is by this that he developes his intelligence, and acquires the know- ledge of all truths necessary to happiness. According to the opinion of the greatest philosopher s it is only by the use of a common language that men can ever agree on the great points of their united and common happiness, or upon the eternal principles of reason, truth, just ice, or upon the most cherished interests of humanity, the sentiments of love, charity, fraternity and benevolence. Q. What, then, is the means by which to create unity of thought, so as to bring all mankind to consider themselves members of one family? A. It is by the medium of a universal language for all man- kind and children of God and nature; the use of the same lan- guage will create everywhere the same sentiments of bene- volence, originate the same thoughts develope the same ideas, spread the same princip1es, the same truths, the same precepts, assimilate opinions, extend light, and purify the mind of those powerful sources of the passions, —hatred, jealousy, ambition and pride.

Q. Explain Sabeism. A. The adoration of the sun and stars, as the visible source of light and fertility, was thus named, and was a worship into which some enlightened nations have fallen. Q. And Saduceeism? A. The Saducees, as opposed to the Pharisees, were a philosophical sect amongst the Hebrews, and were in affinity with the Greek Stoics. 1 Q. And Stoicism? A. The Stoics are a Greek sect who professed to support adversity without complaint. The maxim of this school is that virtue alone is good; it counts amongst its ranks most desirable men. Stoicism may be pushed to excess and degenerate into abuse, but it is always preferable to Epicurism 2 or Sensualism; because man, being subject to the influence of his passions, it is of utility to recall him to spiritualism, or to the duty of preferring celestial to terrestrial things, virtue to vice, and glory, which is an element with great souls, to personal well-being. Q. What is the doctrine of Chance? A. Chance is a word void of sense. Nothing can exist without cause. The world is arranged according to mathe- matical laws by an intelligence. 1 °, Something is; 2 °, Nothing cannot produce something; 3 °, Something cannot be nothing; 1 [As far as can be told from the available reports, the Saducees were Jewish ‘protestants’ who refused to accept any doctrine not in the written Torah; they thus denied doctrines as to spirits and the immortality of the soul to which the Pharisees, who adopted more material from Persian and Babylonian sources than the original compilers of the Tanakh did, subscribed. At the start of the Christian era they contro lled the Temple, bu t had little popular support. The Fourth Book of Maccabees , so-called, which shows clear signs of Stoic influence, was certainly not th e work of a Saducee as it explicitly inculcates the doctrine of rewards and punishments in a future state.] 2 [But what is popularly ca lled “Epicurism” is as mu ch a degeneration of, or simply a vicious calumny on, what Epikuros actually taught.]"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 204 conducting to this proposition and proof; 4 °, Something is eternal. In the Suedo-Gothic language As signifies God, the plural being Asar ; thus the term chance of the Goths and people of the South was God; in the Etruscan language Asar signifies God. Q. What is done in the capitular grades to fix the attention of the Spirit upon the marvellous variations of nature? A. The mind of the Initiate is impressed by agreeable alle- gories and symbols, as images which represent a pure morality able to excite men to practice virtue. Q. What origin would you assign to Masonry? A. The sacred writings of the most ancient nations teach the people, that after the creation of the world men lived for a long time in great holiness: they had the gift of prophecy and foreknowledge and possessed supernatural strength. To this age succeeded an epoch of unnappiness; men already old, hna acquired the basis of all science, but were joyless; they slighted the laws, blasphemed the sacred name of Jehovah, and He. justly irritated, ordained their overthrow, in order to regenerate the world. The Egyptian priests, according to Plato, taught that a whole continent sank beneath the waters; the Indians teach the same, and perpetuate the arts of the survivors. God chose a Sage and said to him: “I have made thee my representative in this terrestrial valley; march therein without fear and I will watch over thy steps; nothing that thou doest shall escape my sight. I have given thee these symbolic tools,—the square, compass, level, and trowel; they are of immortal origin and of precision as immutable as thyself; their construction is confounded with the enteral plans which I have determined.— Raise altars for virtue, dress crowns for it, build prisons for vice. I worked six days and rested on the seventh; imitate me, for the number seven is that of harmony.” Thus spake our divine Master to all, and this symbolic allocution remains engraven upon our hearts in ineffaceable characters.

Q. With what other degrees has the Rose Croix corres- pondence? A. In England the Templar, in Scotland the Rosy Cross, and in Sweden the Knights of Palestine, besides many continental grades of the last century. The Rosy Cross was of old date in Londotn in 1743 ; the first part of the Rite, of H.R.M., is a series of questions and answers, accompanied by ceremonies, and explaining the symbolism common to the Master and Royal Arch Mason, but recognizing, in its allusions, only the three degrees; the seco nd part, or R.S.Y.—C.S.S., is given in doggrel rhyme, and creates the Neophyte a Knight of the Rosy Cross, as an order alleged, without proof, to have been founded for Templar Masons by Bruce after the battle of Bannockburn. The English Templar preceded the degree of the Priestly Order of the Temple of Holy Wisdom, and has many points of similarity with the Rose Croix; there is a three- fold trial of courage and constancy by seven years of pilgrimage and warfare, generally reduced to three, and this is succeeded by a year of penance in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. In this form the degree is sectarian; in our Rite we have the degree in its ancient form. The Encampments forrmerly consisted of 21 members; on entrance a saw was applied to the forehead, and after the Aspirant had undergone the trials of courage, constancy, and penance, he vo wed to defend the Christian Faith, after the manner of St. Peter, who struck off the ear of the servant of the High Priest; and after this the Aspirant was crceated a Templar and clothed; many revisions have been made of this Ceremony, but this was its oldest known form. The degree called in the Swedish sy stem, Knight of Palestine, is said to have descended fromthe Jewish Nethanims, who were a class vowed to defend the Jewi sh Temple, and identified with the Essenes; the degree claims to have been introduced into"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 206 Sweden in the year A .

What is the principal duty of a Knight Mason? A. To believe in God and adore him; to learn to distinguish the sacred from the profane, the light from the darkness. Q. What is the mark of this degree? A. A triangle with a jod in the centre. Q. Are you a Knight of the Temple? A. I have been tried and proved. Q. By what? A. By the Square and Compasses at angles on my breast and in darkness. Q. Why in darkness? A. To show to me that the secrets of this degree were to be hidden from my sight, until the light of my understanding had qualified me to receive them. Q. How were you received? A. Upon four points of geometry, formed by the Square and Compasses and the letter G in the centre. Q. Why were you thus received? A.

Upon both knees, with both hands placed upon the Sacred book of the law, the glaive, symbol of honour, and the Myrtle, emblem of initiation, my thumb and forefingers forming a triangle. Q. Why so? A That, as my hands had been instrumental in duly excuting the noblest parts of Masonry, they were thus placed to figure to my mind that the Compasses of God’s word was to be the standard of every operation of my future life; that I might arrive at the summit of Masonry, by passing through the Speculative degree of this mortal life to that glorious Celestial Senate when the Grand P.W. of T.S.A.O.T.U. will procure us admission, and with whom peace, order and harmony eternally reign. 1 Q. What is the aim of the de gree: of Knight of the Temple? A. The study of that moral and intellectual geometry, which Pythagoras terms Divine Geometry, and Plato the Science of the Gods. As such it may be considered as a continuation of the instruction of a Fellow Craft Freemason. Q. What is the first duty of a Knight Hermetic Philosopher? A. To search the operations of nature. Q. In what consists the instruction? A. It consists in developing the knowledge of nature; its powers, and its different operations. 1 [Up to here, this catechism appears la rgely plagiarised from one or another version of Past Master; compare the “Passing the Chair” and “Past Master” degrees in Carlile’s Manual of Freemasonry .

What is implied by the use of the term Natur? A. God, as He is the first principle of it. Q. Whence is all things derived? A. From nature alone. Q. Into how many principles is nature divided? A. Into four. Dryness, humidity, heat, cold; the four elem- entary qualities. Q. What are the four elements of which our globe is composed? A. Earth, air, fire, and water, represented hermetically by four triangles variously arranged. Q. What influence have the planets on the four elements? A. They have produced the three essentials of all bodies, namely spirit, force or life, an d body; called Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury. Q. What is the spirit, or Sulphur? A. A fixed matter qualified for different productions. Q. And Mercury? A. A matter refined by the union of Salt and Sulphur, or the agreement of the three governing properties of nature. Q. What elements serve the animal kingdom? A. All four are found, but are and fire predominate, and when breathed upon by the Divine Spirit, man becomes perfect, and is placed at the head of the animal kingdom. Q. And the vegetable? A. Vegetables are composed of a germinating fire, formed into a body whilst it remains in the earth, and is purified by its moisture, becoming vegetable, and receiving life by air and moisture or water, whereby the four elements, although distinct, co-operate jointly and separately. Q. How are minerals generated? A. Minerals are things generated and secreted in the earth and called metals, they are composed of air which permeates the earth by heavenly influences, until it meets with a body, which it fixes, congeals, and embues with mineral matter more"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 210 or less perfect; gold and silver and called perfect metals; brass, lead, tin, iron and quicksilver imperfect. Q. How does nature change? A. Into male and female; and is comparable to Mercury. Q. What idea can you give me of nature? A. It is invisible, but it acts vi sibly, for it is a volatile spirit which does its office in a body animated by the universal spirit, and is symbolised in Masonry under the emblem of the flaming star. Q. What does the flaming star signify? A. It is an emblem of the divine fire, of the life-giving light, which renews unceasingly, of th e inexhaustible benevolence of the divine source, which from the centre of the universe gives its laws, rules the course of th e stars, pours fertility on the earth, and is prodigal of ornament in order that its children may be happy. Q. What does it represent positively? A. The divine breath, the central and universal fire, which vivifies all which exists. Q. Can art bring metals to perfecction equally with nature? A. Yes; but in order to do this it is necessary to understand nature exactly, a knowledge much sought after under the name of the philosopher’s stone. Q. What qualities ought they who scrutinize nature to possess? A. They ought to resemble nature itself; be true, simple, patient and constant, the essential chracteristics of a good Mason. Q. To what ought they next to attend? A. The philosopher ought to consider exactly if that which they propose is according to nature, if it is possible and feasible; and if they desire to accomplish things as nature does they must follow it in all points.

It is divided into three ki ngdoms, each of which is triple,"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 211 as represented by our three interlaced triangles, and yet form but one, as in the delta, which is the emblem of the productive strength of nature and of th e harmony which reigns in all bodies, and is moreover a type of divine perfection. The mineral kingdom is symbolized by the password leading to the third degree; the vegetable kingdom by the password leading to the second degree; and the animal kingdom by the word of a Master Mason; The past—the present—the future:—Birth— life—death. The Masonic edifice reposes upon a square, of which the angles represent the four elements, and express the following properties,—Silence, profundity, intelligence, truth. Q. What plan must be followed to operate something more excellent than nature itself? A. To observe in what, and by what, the thing is amel- iorated, and it will be found that it is afways with its like: for example, if we wish to enlarge the intrinsic virtue of some metal beyond nature, it is necessary to seize metallic nature itself and know how to distinguish the male and female in it. Q. In what is the seed contained? A. In the four elements. Q. How and in what manner do the elements engender the seed? A. To comprehend this it must be noticed that two elements are heavy and two are light; of these also two are dry and two humid, at all times one extremely dry and the other extremely damp, besides that they are masculine and feminine, and each prompt to produce things like to itself in its sphere; these four elements are never at rest, but act continually one upon the other and thus they evolve all that is most subtle therein. They have their general rendezvous in the centre, and in the centre of the arc, that servitor of na ture where they mix their seeds, agitate them, and throw them upwards or outwards. Q. What is the first matter of any metal? A. The first proper matter is a double essence or duplicate of itself. Nevertheless no metal can be created without the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 212 concurrence of other things; the first and principal is a warm humidity of the atmosphere, in form of a watery grease, adhe- ring to each thing, whether pu re or impure. The philosophers term this humidity,—Mercury, and it is governed by the rays of the sun and moon. Q. What is the second thing? A. The warmth of the earth; that is to say, a dry warmth, which the philosophers call Sulphur. Q. Is the whole body converted into seed? A. No, only the 400 1 part resting in its centre; as one may see in the example of a grain of wheat. Q. What is the purpose of th e body, relatively to the seed? A. To preserve it from exce ssive warmth, cold humidity, or dryness, and generally all hurtful temperatures, from which it is the purpose of matter to shield it. Q. Will the Artist who attempts to reduce all the material body to seed, find, in effect, much advantage, supposing he succeeds? A. None; on the contrary. hi s, labours wiIl be absolutely useless, for nothing can be done well when swerving from the proceedings of nature. Q. What is it necessary, then, for him to do? A. To disengage matter of all its impurities, for there is no metal, whatever it be, but has its impurities, which are greater at one time than another. Q. How do we represent in Masonry the preparatory and absolute necessity of these purifications? A. By the initiarion of the Apprentice, who is divested of all Metals and Minerals, and, in decent fashion, a part of his vestments, the which is analogous to the superfluities, surfaces, or ashes of which it is necessary to divest matter to find the seed. Q. To what ought the phil osopher pay most attention? A. To the principle of nature, and that point he must not seek in common metals, because having come from the hands"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 213 of the producer the principl e is no longer in them. Q. What is the precise reason? A. It is because common metals, chiefly gold, are absolutely dead, whilst, on the contrary, the other is living and has spirit. Q. What is the life of metals? A. It is no other thing than fire while still couched in the mine. Q. Was fire at one time a Symbol amongst Masons? A. Yes; it was a Symbol as early as the time of Zoroaster, as the purifier of matter: the sublime book of Wisdom, the Sader , gives proof of this. Q. What is the death of Metals? A. Their death and life are equally the same principle; they die by fire, but by a fire of fusion. Q. In what manner are the metals engendered in the bowels of the earth? A. After the four elements have produced their strength or virtue in the centre of the earth where the seed was deposited, the arc of nature sublimes it by distillation and throws it to the surface by heat and the action of perpetual movement. Q. What is the result of the distillation of air through the pores of the earth? A. It results in water, in which all things are born, and which is nothing more than a humid vapour, from which the principle of each thing is formed, and which serves for the first matter of the philosophers. Q. What then, is this first principle which serves the chil- dren of science, for the first ma tter of their philosophical work? A. It will be that matter, which. when conceived, can no longer change its form. Q. Have Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Sun, Moon, &c., different seeds? A. They have all one and the same seed, but the place of their birth is the cause of their difference, and nature has sooner achieved its work in the procreation of silver than gold,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 214 so also of other metals. Q. How is Gold formed in the bowels of the earth? A. As has been said before; when the vapour which philo- sophers have called Mercury passes into a warm and pure place containing a certain sulphurous grease adhering to the parti- tions, then it accomodates and forms itself to this grease, which it sublimes, and from the mixture results a certain unctuousity, which loses the name of vapour to take that of grease; it then sublimes itself in other places which have been cleansed by the preceding vapours, and become more subtle, pure, and humid, fills the pores of this earth, and joining itself to it produces gold. Q. How can philosophy produce some particular thing? A. With the germ thereof, or that perfect quintessence which is more valuable to the operator than the same thing in nature. Thus, in order that philosophy may obtain this seed or germ, nature must be taken to do duty and second the operation. Q. What is this germ or seed? A. It is the perfect decoction of the thing itself, called the balm of sulphur, which is the sa me quality as the radical humid- ity in metals. Q. What engenders this seed or germ? A. The four elements, by the will of the Supreme Being, and the imagination of nature. Q. How do the four elements operate? A. By a continuous and indefatigable movement, each according to its quality throwing its seed towards the centre of the earth, where it is reducede and digested, and then thrown upwards by the laws of motion. Q. What do philosophers understand by the centre of the earth? A. A certain empty space is imagined by them where nothing can rest. Q. Where, then, do the four elements rest their qualities and seeds? A. In the eccentric, where is the margin and circumference"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 215 of the centre, which after it has taken a due proportion rejects the surplus outwards and the excrements from the ashes, fires, and even stones—that brute stone, or rough ashlar, which is the emblem of the first Masonic stae. Q. Explain more fully by an example. A. Take a sound and even table, and in the centre of it put a vase of water, and around that place various articles of different colours between others, such as salt, and taking care to keep all separate. Then spill the water in the centre, and you will perceive that the streams take the colours of the various articles; as it encounters a red colour, it takes a reddish tint; passing the salt it becomes saline, for it is certain that the water changes not the things but the diverse objects change the nature of the water; so the seed thrown by the four elements to the centre of the earth contracts different modifications as it passes amongst different substances, and through different branches, canals, or conduits; so each thing acquires its charac- teristic according to diversity of situation; as the seed encoun- ters pure water or earth so it is pure, or on the contrary. Q. How is Saturn engendered? A. When this unctuosity, or grease, arrives at places totally impure and cold. Q. How is the definition applicable to the Novitiate? A. By the application of the word—profane, which resemb- ling Saturn applies effectually to all that reside in impure and cold places, allegorically applied to the world, the century, and its imperfections. Q. How do you symbolise the work of making gold. A. By the picture of a masterpiece of architecture, magnifi- cently painted in its details, all brilliant with gold and precious stones. Q. How is Venus engendered? A. When the earth, though pure, is mixed with impure sulphur? Q. What power has this vapour in the centre of the earth?"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 216 A. It sublimes by continued process whatever is crude and impure, constantly clothing with itself that which is pure. Q. What is the seed of th e first matter of all things? A. The first matter of things, or the principal precipitant, is born by nature with the aid of seed; that is to say, nature receives the matter from the elements wh ence the seed is engendered. Q. What is the seed of things, absolutely speaking? A. The seed is body, congea led air, a humid vapour, which if not resolved by a warm vapour becomes altogether useless. Q. How is the generation of the seed in the metallic kingdom maintained? A. By the artifice of the arc; the four elements in their first generation by nature, distill to the centre of the earth a vapour of ponderous water which is the seed of metals, and called Mercury, not because of its essence, but on account of its fluidity and easy adherence to something. Q. Why is this vapour compared to Sulphur? A. Because of its internal heat. Q. What become of the seed after congelation? A. It becomes the radical humidity of matter. Q. What sort of mercury do you understand the metals to be composed of? A. The mercury of the philosophers and common mercury, which cannot be a seed, as it co ntains its own, like all other metals. Q. What is it necessary to take for the subject of our matter? A. The seed or fixed grain only, and not the entire body, which is distinguished in male life as sulphur and female life as mercury. We should conjoin them together so that they may form a germ, from which proceeds the formation of the fruit of their nature. Q. In this operation what do you understand the artist to make? A. The artist is understood to make nothing, but only to"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 217 separate that which is subtle from that which is gross. Q. What then does all philosophical combination reduce itself to? A. To make two of one, and one of two, and nothing more. Q. Is there any Masonic analogy in this operation? A. The intelligent spirit is arrested by the mysterious num- ber three, upon which turns e ssentially all Masonic science. Q. Where is the seed and life of minerals and metals found? A. The seed of minerals is the water which is found in the centre and heart of minerals? Q. How does nature operate by the help of art? A. All seed, whatsoever it be, is of no value, until be art or nature it is put in a convenient matrix, where it receives its life and is made to produce the ge rm, and congelation, or pure point, or fixed grain. Q. How is the seed nourished or conserved? A. By the warmth of its body. Q. What, then, can the artist achieve in the mineral kingdom? A. That which nature left unfinished, to dismiss the crudity of the air, which by its violence has filled the pores in each body, not in the bowels of the earth but its surface. Q. What correspondence have the metals between themselves? A. To properly understand this correspodence it is necessary to consider the position of the planets and to pay attention to Saturn, the highest, and to which succeeds Jupiter, Sun, Mars, Venus, Mercury and the Moon. It is necessary to observe that the planetary virtues do not ascend but descend, and experience teaches us that Mars is easily converted to Venus, but not Venus to Mars, as being of a lower sphere; thus Jupiter is easily transmuted to Mercury, because Jupiter is higher than Mercury; that is, the second above the firmament; this is the second above the Earth, Saturn the highest the"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 218 Moon the lowest; the Sun mixes with all, but is never ameliorated by the inferiors. It is clear that there is great correspondence between Saturn and the Moon, in the midst of which is the Sun, but for all changes the philosopher should seek to administer the Sun. Q. When the philosophers speak of gold or silver, from which they extract their matter, do they mean common gold or silver? A. No, because common gold or silver are dead, whilst those of the philosophers are full of life. Q. What is the object of the Hermetic Masons? A. To seek the knowledge of the art of perfecting that which nature has left imperfec t in the mineral kind and to arrive at the treasure of the philosopher’s stone. Q. What is that stone? A. The philosopher’s stone is the radical humidity of the elements, perfectly purified and brought to a happy fixity; that which operates such great things for the health is the unique latent life in the radical humidity. Q. In what consists the secret of performing this admirable work? A. The secret consists in knowing how to extract the power whilst in the act of innate heat, or the fire of nature enclosed in the centre of the radical humidity. Q. What are the precautions necessary that the work be not spoiled? A. It is necessary to take great care in removing the dross and to see to secure only the kernel or centre which encloses all the virtue of the mixture. Q. Why will this medicine cure all sorts of disease? A. It powerfully fortifies the natural heat and excites it gently, whilst other remedies irritate by violent action. Q. What is the truth of th e art as regards the tincture? A. This truth is found, firstly, in the fact that the physical powder is made in the same manner as metals are formed; to"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 219 wit—Mercury; it has the faculty of mixing with the metals in fusion, one nature embracing another which is like itself. Secondly, in that the imperfect metals are not perfect, because their mercury, ripe and burning an d properly a pure fire, cannot easily communicate to them maturity and transmute them into its own nature, until after having made attraction of their crude humidity, for their mercury is the only substance which trans- mutes them, the rest being but ashes and excrement which are rejected in the projection. Q. What route ought the philosopher to follow in order to arrive at the knowledge and execution of the physical work? A. The same route that T.S.A.O.T.U. employed in the creation of the world in observing how chaos was cleared up. Q. What was the matter of Chaos? A. It could be no other thing than a humid vapour, because there was nothing but water betwixt created substance, terminating by a veritable substance to receive the forms. Q. Give me an example of this. A. We may take as an example the production of particular mixtures, of which the seeds resolve themselves into a certain humour; which is the particular chaos whence is drawn by irradiation the form of all the plants; hence it is necessary to observe that Scripture makes no mention, in any placee, but of water as the material object upon which the spirit of God was borne, and of light for universal form. Q. What advantage can the philosopher draw from this reflection, and what ought he particularly to remark of the manner in which the Supreme Being created the world? A. He will first observe the matter from which the world was created, and see that from the confused mass the Sovereign Artist commenced by extracting light, which instantly dispelled the darkness which covered the earth and secured for the universal form of matter. He then discovers that in the genera- tion of all mixtures there is a species of irradiation and a separa- tion of light from darkness, in whcih nature is constantly imita-"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 220 ting the Creator. He then comprehends that by this light the action was extended, for the firmament separated the waters from the waters. The heavens were then created and the luminous bodies, but the superior things were at a distance from the inferior, and the moon was created as an intermediary torch between the higher and the lower, and after having received the celestial influences communicated it to the earth; then the Creator assembled the waters and caused dry land to appear. There is only one firmament, but some notwithstand- ing admit three; the first immediately above us, or the rarified atmosphere thrown back, even to the fixed stars, where revolve the planets and stars; the second in the same part as the fixed stars; and the third in the plac e of the supercelestial waters. Q. Why is the rarification of the waters terminated at the first heaven, and yet extended beyond? A. Because it is the nature of rarified things to mount upwards, and because God in his eternal laws has assigned to each thing its proper sphere. Q. Why do the celestial bodies turn as round an axle without declining? A. Because it is their first impressed movement, in the same way that a heavy mass in ba;ance turns equally if the movement is equal. Q. Why do the superior waters wet not? A. Because of their extreme rarification. Hence a chemist can draw more advantage from the science of rarification than any other. Q. How is the firmament composed or extended? A. The firmament is air, and its nature is more conformable to light than it is to water. Q. Having separated the waters from the dry land, what did the Creator do to induce generation? A. He created a particular light destined to that office, and placed it in that central fire, which he tempered by the humidity of the waters and the coldness of the earth. in order to repress"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 221 its action, and thus its heat was more conformable to the design of its author. Q. How did the ancient cosmogonies express this? A. Sanconiathon, the Phœnician, gives the theogonoy of his time thus:—Chaos, the spirit or breath, drew its principle from light, the wind, Calp, and his wife, Bati, engendered Æon, and Æon engendered Genogu. Chronos was the father of Thoth, the first legislator of Egypt, who replaced hieroglyphics by a clear but metaphorical language which was employed by the Hebrew legislator; he transmitted, in turn, the history of the loss of primitive purity, in the sublime picture of the garden of Eden. Berosus, the Chaldean, gives a cosmogony similar to that of Moses, and records, moreover, the ancient Babylonian tradition of the deluge, under Aquarius, the eleventh or rainy month, a circumstance taken advantage of in some of the Masonic systems, as the Primitiv e and Original Phremasonry, or Swedenborgian Rite. Q. How does the central fire act? A. It acts continually upon the humid matter which is nearest to it, whence rises a vapour which is the mercury of nature and the first matter of the three natural kingdoms. Q. How is the sulphur of nature formed? A. By the double action, or rather re-action, of the central fire, upon the mercurial nature. Q. How is sea salt formed? A. It is formed by the action of this same fire upon aqueous humidity, after the aërial humidity has been exhaled. Q. What method ought the truly wise philosopher to adopt in his proceedings? A. When he has well comprehended the foundation and order which T.S.A.O.T.U. has observed in the creation of all that exists in nature, he ought, as far as possible, to be a faitthful copyist of the Creator; the artist, in his physical work, should strive to promote an effectual separation, the light from the darkness, to cause his firmament to separate the waters from"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 222 the waters, and to follow the steps indicated for the perfect accomplishment of the whole work of creation. Q. With what do they perform this grand and subIime operation? A. With a single corpuscle, or small body, containing nothing but lees and abominations, from which they extract a certain dark and mercurial humidity, which comprehends in itself all that is necessary to the philosopher, because he seeks only the true mercury. Q. What kind of mercury is it which is necessary for the work? A. A mercury of which the kind is not found upon earth, but is extracted from the body operated on; it is not common mercury. Q. Why is common mercury unsuited for the work? A. Because the wise artist has first to attend to the fact that common mercury does not contain a sufficient quantity of sulphur, and he ought therefore to operate upon a body in which nature has joined together the sulphur and the mercury. He ought then to separate them, purify them, and join them together again. Q. How do you designate this body masonically? A. As the brute-stone, or rough ashlar, chaos, illiaste or hylé. The roughstone of our first degree does not represent common mercury; we designate that by the word profane, which includes all subjects unsuitable for the masonic work. Q. How is it that common mercury lacks its external agent? A. Owing to the rise of the double vapour the commotion is so great or subtle, that the sp irit of the silver is somewhat evaporated before it arrives at fusion, so that the sole mercurial part remains deprived of its sulphurous masculine agent, making it so that it cannot be transmuted in or by nature. Q. How many kinds of gold do philosophers distinguish? A. Three sorts; astral gold, elementary gold, and common gold."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 223 Q. What is astral gold? A. Astral gold has its source in the sun which communicates it with its rays and its light, to all inferior existences. It is a light substance emanating continual solary corpuscules which penetrate all that is sensative or vegetative. Q. Is that the sense in which we ought to view the sun on the Masonic tracing board? A. Without doubt; all other interpretations are veils to dis- guise from the candidate, the ph ilosophical truths which it is not intended that he should perceive at first sight, in order that his meditative spirit may be exercised. Q. What do you understand by elementary gold? A. All sublunary beings of the three kingdoms contain in their centre a precious grain of this elementary gold; it is the most pure and most fixed part of the elements and of all the substances which are com posed of the elements. Q. How is this figured in Masonry? A. As the pictured sun indicates the astral gold, so the moon pictures its reign over all subjacent and sublunary bodies which have in their centre the fixed grain of elementary gold. Q. Explain common gold. A. It is the most beautiful known metal, so perfectly produced by nature that it is unalterable. Q. Where is it designated in Masonic Symbolism? A. In the three jewels,—the triangle, compass, and square, all representative instruments of pure gold. Q. Of what kind of gold is the stone of the philosophical Masons? A. It is of the second species, as being the most pure portion of all the metallic elements after its purification, and then it is called living philosophical gold. Q. What is the signification of the nmber four when used in several of our degrees? A. Beyond the perfect equilibrium and perfect equality of the four elements of the physical stone, it signifies four things"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 224 which are necessary for the accomplishment of the work, these are:—composition, alternation, mixing, union, the which once done by the rules of art will give the legitimate child fo the sun, and will produce the phœnix, reborn from its ashes. Q. What is the living gold of the philosophers? A. It is no other thing than the fire of mercury, or that fiery virtue enclosed in the radical humidity, which has already communicated fixity and nature to the sulphur from which it emanates; the philosopher’s sulphur ceases not to be called mercury because all its substance is mercurial. Q. What other names do the philosophers give to their living gold? A. They call it also their living sulphur, their true fire; it is found enclosed in all bodies, and none can subsist without it. This living gold, living sulphur, or true fire, must be sought in the house of mercury. Q. Whence comes this fire? A. From the air. Q. Give me a comparison applicable to the power of this fire. A. To express the attraction of this internal fire, we can make no better comparison than th at of thunder, which is a dry and terrestrial exhibition united to a humid vapour, having the quality of exhaling and taking the fiery nature, which, by acting upon its inherent humidity it attracts and transmutes to its own nature; after which it is precipitated to the earth by the attrac- tion of a nature like itself. Q. What ought the artist to do after the extraction of his mercury? A. He ought to withdraw th e power or reduce its action. Q. Can nature not do this of itself? A. No, because after a first sublimation it is arrested, and the matter so disposed engenders the metals. Q. What is understood by the philosopher’s gold and silver?"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 225 A. They give the name of gold to their sulphur, and silver to their mercury. Q. Whence do they draw them? A. As said before, they are drawn from homogenous bodies where they are found in abundance, and they extract them by an admirable and entirely philosophical means. Q. This operation being complete, what should be the issue? A. The philosophical amalgam should be made with great care, but it cannot operate until after the sublimation of the mercury in due proportion. Q. When ought the amalgam to be united with the living gold? A. It is not a matter of time, but in the nature of the amalgam; that is to say, of this mixture a single substance is made, and by the addition of the sulphur the work is abridged and the tincture augmented. Q. What is contained in the centre of the radical humidity? A. It concealed the sulphur, which is covered with a hard rind. Q. What must be done to apply it to the great work? A. To draw it with much art from its prison by means of putrefaction. Q. Has nature any convenient menstruel in the mines proper to dissolve and deliver this sulphur? A. No, for it has but a local movement; if it could dissolve, putrify, and purify the metallic body, it would give us the physical stone, that is to say, a sulphur exalted and multiplied in virtue. Q. Give me an example of how you apply this theory. A. We will take a grain of wheat or the fruit seed, which is put in an earth adapted to its putrefaction and thus to multiply it; God, the wise philosopher, knows the good grain, draws it from the centre, throws it in its proper soil, and when it has been well fumed and prepared it becomes so subtilised that its prolific virtue extends and multiplies to infinity."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 226 Q. In what consists the secret of this seed? A. In a proper knowledge of the soil suitable for it. Q. What do you understand by the seed in this work? A. I understand the innate heat, or the specific spirit enclosed in the radical humidity; or the mean substance of the mercury, which is, properly, the sperm of the metals enclosing the seed. Q. How do you deliver the sulphur from its prison? A. By putrefaction. Q. What is the metallic earth? A. It is their proper menstruel. Q. By what diagram did the Hermetics represent these things? A. Inside a circle, they placed a square, which enclosed a delata, within which was a point, from which proceeded two lines; the inscription being:—“From the first ens proceeded two contraries, from these the three principles, and from them the four elements; if you separate the pure from the impure you obtain the quintessence. Q. How were these formul æ employed theosophically? A. They disguised the free discussion of theology under alchemical terms, or by using ch emical language to signify, by previous arrangement, spiritual and theosophical truths, or in other words by the employment of an operative art for specula- tive purposes: thus potable gold signifies the spring of truth; the philosopher’s stone, divine truth; the crucible, conscience. The last example of this kind is in an address of 1721 to the Grand Lodge of London. Q. Name the principal Hermetic philosophers. A. In Egypt, Hermes; who has given to Alchemy the name of philosophy, and to whom is attributed a great number of works of which two have come down to us under his name; Geber the ancient Arabian Alchemist; Roger Bacon, in England; Alfaroby, whose works in MS. are in the library of Leyden; Paracelsus, in German y; Arnaud to Villeneuve;"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 227 Nicholas Flamel, in France; Albert the Great, in Germany; St. Thomas Aquinas, in Italy; and last, though not least, Raymond Lully, in Spain. They constituted Moses an Adept, and to K:ng Solomon they attributed the Clavicule , an apocryphal book wherein is found the arcana of the Great Work. Silver was called the Moon, the Queen; Gold, the Sun, the King; and its dissolvents, as nitro-hydrochloric acid, was termed the Aqua Regia , the Royal water or the Royal bath. Q. It is true that our anci ent brethren have hidden the divine light of the Magnum opus in hieroglyphics, enigmas, and parables, and the Hermetic Philosopher will be supremely fortu- nate who shall by arduous labour discover the sacred place where the sublime truth lies hidden all naked, for he has then found the true light and heavenly good; even when the Adepts treat solely on morals, there they are the most obscure and so conceal their meaning from all but the Initiates. Seek, there- fore, laboriously the light of the Sages, whilst ye hide it from the stupid, profane and ambitious; imitate the owl which sees by night and so hides itself from treacherous curiosity. He who comprehends the work, saith the Sages, shall know great thigns, but whenever you depart from the centre of the square and compasses, you will no longer be able to work with success. By the aid of the square, level, plumb, and balance, the rough ashlar must be worked from the triangle to the cube, to become the philosophical stone. Expl ain this mystery if you can. A. The secrets of the Great Work, or search for the absolute, like all the mysteries of Magism, have a threefold application; they are religious, philosophical, and natural. Above all it is the creation of man by himself, the conquest which he makes of his future, and the perfect emancipation of his will, represented by the pentacle of Solomon. It is that law of creation which resutls from the accord of two forces, the development of complete power over the universal magical agent, or Azoth, and the separation of the subtle from the gross with much industry and painful labour. As a religion it is that"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 228 of the initiates of all ages; as a philosophy we must seek its principles in the schools of Egypt; as a science in the process of Paracelsus, Flammell, and Lulli. The prima materia of the Great Work , in the superior world, is enthusiasm and activity; in the intermediate it is intelligence and industry; in the lower diligence and labour. In science it is salt, or earth, giving solidity; sulphur or elementary fire, comprehending magnetism and electricity, giving softness; mercury or spirit, giving life. This science is a search for the immovable basis of religious faith, philosophical truth and metallic transmutation. The mercury must be fecundated by sulphur that it may regenerate the salt. Various masonic system s have given an expalation of the symbolic language of the Hermetic philosopher. Q. Explain this more distinctly. A. When the Adepts affirm that a single vessel alone is necessary for the transmutation, an alembic which is within reach of all, and which each possesses without knowing it, they allude to the philosophical and moral alchemy, and the vessel is man himself. When they speak of the brazen sea, in which bathe the Sun and Moon, King and Queen, they mean the purified waters of celestial grace, which do not soil the hands but cleanes all leporous bodies. The Spouse and the Six Virgins, are the seven metals an d the seven virtues; the primary metal of the Sun, truth, has in it the germ by which we can ally it with the six others. It is said,—“When the Sun shall have visited his twelve houses, typified by the twelve chambers of the Hermetic philosopher, and found you attentive to receive him, matter will no longer have po wer over you; you will be no longer a dweller on earth, but af ter a certain period will give back to earth a body which be longs to it, to take up one altogether spiritual. Therefore the body must be revivified and born again, from its ashes, which must be effected by the vege- tation of the Tree of Life, represented to us by the Golden Branch of Eleusis, and the sprig of Myrtle.” The beginning of the work is represented by black, which gives place to white,"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION I ( SENATE ) 229 and that to red, out of which arises a brilliant sun. The great tower in which is to burn the light of the Sages must be built in exact rule and proportion. We must labour to discover the principle of life shut up in the profundity of matter and known by the name of Alkahest, which has the generative virtue of producing the triangular cubic stone, the white stone of the Apocalypse. By the term, “fixin g the volatile,” we indicate the materialization of the spirit, an d by “volatizing the fixed” we signify the spiritualization of matter. To “separate the subtle from the gross” is to free the soul from prejudice and vice; we effect this by the salt of wisdom, the mercury of aptitude and labour, and the sulphur of energy, or the ardour of omnipotent will, represented by the pentacle, for by will an things are made; it ts the great Athemor or furnace, which serves to separate the subtle from the gross and the fixed from the volatite. Q. What symbols are employed to indicate this spiritual transmutation? A. The entire work is symbolized by the Pelican and Phœnix. The metals in a state of ebullition are represented by lions of different colours. The end and perfection is repre- sented by a triangle surmounted by a cross. The gold and silver of divine truth by the Sun and Moon. The four symbolic animals, the four elements, and four principles correspond with each other.—Azoth, Eagle, Air. + Sulphur, Lion, Fire. + Mercury, Man, Water. + Salt, Bull, Earth.—Spirit, matter, movement, repost, which are Hermetically reducible to the absolute, volatile, and fixed. Salt is represented by the winged dragon and cubic stone; Sulphur by the flying eagle; Mercury by the man-woman, beared, winged, and mounted on a cube and crowned with flames. Of colours, black represents earth; white, water; blue, air; red, fire.

Q. What are the benefits reaped from this science, called the Operating of the Great Work? A. They are twofold. The first is intellectual, and consists in knowing God, Nature, and oneself; the other relates to the body, and gives wealth and health. The one art cannot be accomplished without the knowledge of the other. Q. What is the true aim of philosophical Masonry? A. To raise a temple to wisdom of which the immutable principle is virtue, which it is necessary to strive to preserve constantly in our souls. Q. Do you know the origin and signification of numbers? A.

The Aspirant to the Templar Priest represented Joshua stopped by the angel of the Lord with his sword drawn in his hand; the officers were seven pillars, alluding to the words, “Wisdom hath builder her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars;” the Bible had seve n seals, and the Aspirant made seven journeys, answered seven questions and received seven passwords, during which he was seven times regaled with fruit and other things; after which he was finally admitted to the Sanctuary, clothed in white, and crowned with the fair mitre mentioned by the Prophet Hoshea.

Q. What are the most ancient books in the world? A. They are the Egyptian Book of the Dead; the Indians’ Vedas; the Ramayana; the Mahabarata; the Zend Avesta; the Brahmins date their era from the creation of the world; that is to say from the commencement of the Caliyoug. This tradition is constant and uniform amongst the order of the Brahmins.

In considering attentively the state of astronomy in China, India, Chaldea, where are fo und the most ancient relics of the elements of science, we discover a striking conformity between the Chinese, Chaldean s, Indians and other of the ancient races, in their traditions, customs, philosophy, religion and science, as well as in their relative institutions. All speak of"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION II ( AREOPAGUS ) 237 a state of primitive innocence, and a golden age, the traditions of a deluge and the alarm it spread over the earth; they have an equal veneration for mountains, the tradition of giants, and follow the custom of Orienting their temples, divide the year into twelve months or moons and the week into seven days; all speak of a similar legislator in arts, science and religion; with a like uniformity in the development of thought; and above all they have conserved traces of a time of ignorance which succeeded that of light. These conformities are not the result of interc- ommunication, as they have natural and essential points, but rather indicate an identity of origin between the ancient nations as the remains of the institutions of a yet more ancient people. Q. Give us some idea of astronomy and the distance of the stars. A. The distince which separates us from the stars is almost infinite, and the expanse in which they run their course is immense. If we examine attentively the movement of the celestial bodies and their positions, although thousands of years have elapsed sinc ehte winter solstice, when the astronomers formed a calendar and named the months from the position of the new and full moon in the constellations to a minute of a particular day, it can be determined when this period was. The long life of the first men, as indicated to us by the scriptures, rendered them astronomers almost universally; these patriarchs, pastrols, and agriculturalists multiplied their observations and transmitted them to their children, who added their own and left the collection to those who came after them. Josephus states that we owe the science of astrology to the children of Seth, who is believed to be identical with the Egyptian Set, and as he had been instructed by Adam that the world would perish by fire and water, and fearing that the science would perish before mankind was instructed therein, they built two columns on which were engraved the knowledge they had acquired; this foresight was so successful that Josephus assures us that the columns existed in his days in Syria. In this way they formed a"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 238 college of astronomical epochs and remarkable occurrences, which the different nations deriving from the same source preserved more or less accurately. The astronomical epoch of 600 years explains the extended life given to the patriarchs, for it is only after the lapse of this period that the great year is accomplished, 1 and they could not have perfected the sciences of astronomy and geometry in a less period of time. God said to man, “Raise yourselves up as much as you will, agitate each other, the tumultuous waves of your profound discussions will often be adversely broken against the rock of facts which my will has marked, but my laws remain immutable.” Q. What is animal nature? A. It is a state without reflection, submitted to chance or caprice, and resembling brute life. Q. And the natural state adapted to mankind? A. It is a state of reason and reflection, the essence of thought, and it is from that alone that man can progress. He falls only into savage life when he ceases to reason upon the manners and customs which he de rived from his ancestors, and to follow them in his understanding. Q. Is the idea of a period of creation common to all nations? A. All nations without exception have transmitted the belief in a period of commencement; it is a fact attested by all the people of the earth. Let us transport ourselves to ancient Egpyt, Chaldea, Persia, India, Siam, China, Japan, the ancient Northern races, lastly ancient Greece. These all say with unanimous voice: the earth has not existed for ever, it had its first men, who gave to their children a life which they received from an invisible hand. All people, in all parts of the world, are persuaded of the existence of God as first cause, all-powerful and intelligent. This universal tradition, which has been trans- mitted as a fact from the world’s commencement, is not such as 1 [I am not sure to what, if any, astronomical cycle this supposed 600 year period refers, but the designation “great year” is more normally applied to the cycle of Precession, of ca. 26 , 000 years.]"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION II ( AREOPAGUS ) 239 would naturally have been invented; if the world had been eternal people would have had no doubt of it; whence then have they drawn an opinion of its commencement? Neither their own experience or that of their ancestors could have taught this opinion, if the world had always existed. Q. Do all nations trace mankind to the same origin? A. Nearly all derive the first man from the earth; but two difficulties are raised as to this origin, one is the difference existing between the negro and the white man, and the other is that but little communication existed between the nations of the old continent and those of the new. Q. Are mankind, then, of different species? A. On the Contrary, there has never been more than one species of man; tending to prove that they have spread over the surface of the earth at a vast distance of time from a central source; undergoing a variety of change by the influence of climate and nourishment, modified by epidemic maladies and the infinite mixture of a variety of individuals more or less res- embling each other. Originally these differences were only indi- vidual, but they have become more marked bv the continuous action of the same cause, and it is very probably that in time the variations disappear little by little as the causes of them cease, or vary by other combinations and circumstances. From this it would appear that the or igin of all nations is identical, and the resemblance of the North American savages to the Oriental Tartars ought to strengthen their opinion that their origin is the same; the Russian discoveries beyond Kamtschatka of several isles which extend even to the western continent of America leave us in no doubt as to the possibility of communi- cation, even if the sunken continent of the Egpytians had no existence.

Q. Do you believe that all things originate by chance? A. I would as soon believe that a watch is made by chance; the Universe equally proves a maker. Q. Has matter, the wolrd in all its parts, been created? A. Let us suppose matter to be eternal: say, firstly, there has been nothing able to create it; if it is eternal in its existence none of its particles none of it s particles can receive or commu- nicate anything, nothing perishes or acquires anything, because everything in all its parts is ne cessary for its essence, in which case nothing is as we find it in nature. Secondly, if matter is eternal in its essence, it ought to be eternally in movement or repose. If in movement, is this by its own essence or by a first cause? If in itself, then movement is essential to it, and the com- mencement of motion to any part of matter impossible. Is the idea of repose equally difficult by attributing motion to a first cause; take the first movement to have been created in it, if it has been eternally in repose, is it in movement by its own force? Q. Will repose by necessary and movement possible by a second cause? A. Suppose the nature of matter to be indifferent either to movement or repose; since its repose is disturbed in order to be moved, we see a creative cause of movement in matter. But if matter is considered eternal, and we suppose that it is eternal in itself, we are face to face with the same questions asked upon its movement and repose; what is that eternal matter which exists and is moved by some cause not found in its own essence and existenc eor in its manner of existence, and which notwith- standing is not created? Those wh o will not admit a creation in time will be forced to admit one in eternity, which implies a contradiction, because it supposes a thing existing from eternity before its producer. Q. Is the mind alarmed by attempting to derive something from nothing?"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION II ( AREOPAGUS ) 241 A. We may observe that it is not by nothing that something is created; and in this, we recognise a first cause, an infinite power which has the fecundite power 1 of creating. To follow out all the absurdities which flow from the eternity of matter, we must admit it to have distinguishing intelligence; pure matter existing by itself, and having in its own nature the infinite power of creating, or the liberty of creating or not creating, of doing it at one time or another, with the choice of the manner of it? Q. Then reason teaches us that the world and the first man were created? A. Let us give a moment to those who do not desire to see the action of God in nature. We will permit them to form a world to their own notions; give them abundance of matter, a circular motion, and ample duration, will they choose the laws of Descartes or Newton? 2 The earth is formed according to their ideas, but it is naked, without verdure or inhabitants, though all the laws and combinations of movement are in action; their earth is nothing more than a frightful desert; if the least plant grows, or the least worm crawls, it denotes an intelligence, and it is necessary to assign its structure and action to some particular will. Movement cannot construct the rings and entrails of tis worm, nor the organs of that plan t: how can it ordain an earth and render it habitable? Can it apportion the necessary circum- stances to the wants of the inhabitants, give each its just measure of air, water, and fire, and place them at such equitable distance from the sun that they will be ne ither frozen by cold nor burnt by too near a proximity thereto? If the plants and inhabitants of this earth are introduced by some special will, can we doubt that the same wisdom which create d the plants and animals has 1 [Is a “fecundite power” of the same genus as a “dormitive virtue”?] 2 [Descartes apparently subscribed to laws of motion according to which a body could have its direction changed provided its speed remained constant, without a physical force acting on it, as against Newton’s first law; his theory of mind-body interaction depended on th is because it made it possible for the mind, conceived of as immaterial, to e ffect changes in the body by means of changing the direction of motion of ‘ani mal spirits’ in the physical organism.]"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 242 prepared them a residence conformable to their wants? 1 If this earth be composed according to the idea of the mater- ialists by assembling round a co mmon centre several beds of matter placed one upon another according to their qualities, the heaviest below and the lighter above, it is without utility, because it will be without organism; no atmosphere producing by turns weight and resistance; no diversity in the exterior beds suited to the diverse grain; no crucible-basin as the receptacle of the salt and the water so necessary for the fecundity of the surface; no mountains to collect the evaporations of the sea and precipitate them by rivers running through the plains; no gravelly earth to prepare the wells; no basis of clay to retain the water in the gravel; no subterranean waters to convey in their progress the salt, bitumen, sand, li me, vitriol, mercury, sulphur, of which the concourse and fermentation produce mineral waters and warm baths; there precious stones, here building stones, and here metals. How can they persuade us that these mechanical operations so superior to our own knowledge can be executed by chance in the massive crust of our sun? This earth, constructed according to the idea of the philosophers, will be good for nothing; and the marvellous apparel of our globe demonstrates that not an accident arises in nature, but everything is by express creation and the plain arrangement of designed precautions. The spectacle of nature is, then, in perfect accord with the recital of Moses, the Hebrew legislator, and the cosmogony of the ancient people before his time. 1 [If the circumstances of the planet were not suited to the persistence of organic life, organic life —however originating—would not have persisted and we would not be having this discussion . Arguments from probabilities have little meaning here when we take into account the number of stars in the galaxy and the time-scales involved. The passage following simply demon- strates a limited knowledge of geologic al processes and a complete ignorance of the way that in complex systems, very small variations in initial condictions produce, even by the operations of pure ly deterministic laws, wildly varying results; hence it is not necessary to postulate conscious interference subse- quent to the initial formation of the planet to account for the non-uniform nature of its crust.]"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION II ( AREOPAGUS ) 243 Q. Is it possible that our earth is a detached mass from some celestial body, or the result of one of the spots which astronomers observe on the sun’s disk? A. It has been demonstrated by Newton that a body detached by the force of projection from some other body which continues its attraction by the known rules of gravitation, describes in its movements one of the curves known as conic sections; hence such projected body ought in virtue of these laws to refall again upon the weightier at its first revolution. Hence, if our earth was thrown off from some other to be launched into space, it would fa ll again upon the parent body, and would not continue that revolution round the sun of which we are the witnesses and admirers. A bullet projected from the surface of the earth at any force or angle would necessarily fall back in virtue of its gravitation; but if a cannon was raised above the surface of the earth and the bullet sent from it with sufficient force, it would turn round the earth and pass at each revolution by the point from which it started. 1 It is the same, in affinity, as regards our earth and the sun, for observation proves that the earth describes an ellipse round that star, and it follows from this that since creation our globe has always been in the point of its actual orbit, for now law of nature could have placed it there. This serves to prove, at the same time, the nature of the planetary system, which admits no successive arrangement, but has followed from the beginning the precise 1 [Conic sections include circles and el lipses. Everything after ‘hence’ does not follow at all from Newton’s theory of gravitation; for one thing if it were true the words “escape velocity” would have no meaning. In any case, the argument can be shown to be false on its own terms. If it is possible to put a body b into orbit around a body a by launching it with a sufficient velocity (call it v 1 ) from a point p above the surface of a , then by launching a body c from the surface of a at a velocity v 2 (of greater magnitude than v 1 ) such that at the point that it reaches p (or any other point the same distance from the centre of a ) it is travelling at v 1 , it will also enter orbit about a . The above is just for the sake of argument; I am well aware that the suggestion purportedly refuted in the le cture is not in any case currently favoured as a theory of planetary formation.]"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 244 order which our eyes actually witness in the universe. Q. What do you learn by the natural sciences? A. The science called natural tea ches the eternity of worlds. That worlds are still in the act of formation. That our globe has been millions of years in a state of incandescence. That organic life commences at the lowest step of the ladder. That it has been crowned by the birth of humanity. Q. What is the first want of humanity? A. The existence of order. Q. And the second want? A. The conservation of order. Q. And the third? A. The examination of the basis of order. Q. And the fourth? A. The compression of that examination, so far as order is based upon hypothesis, and such compression is possible. Q. And the fifth? A. When the compression is no longer possible, it is the destruction of the hypothesis. Q. And the sixth? A. The substitution of truth for hypothesis. It is only on the seventh day that humanity can repose on the principle of order. From the first humanitarian day, Order, the first social want and the basis of virtue, rested upon the sanction of religion, for outside order the existence of social life is as impossible as the existence of organic life outside the atmosphere; from the most savage horde to the most civilized empire, order can only exist when based on a common religious sanction, and when such community has ceased to exist, the horde or the empire has vanished at the same time as the community. 1 Q. What is the law of activity? 1 [Unless the word ‘religious’ is taken in a much broader sense than that generally used, this statement is demonstrably false.]"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION II ( AREOPAGUS ) 245 A. To learn to will in order to be able to act, is the great law of the activity of intelligent bein gs; it is a law which nature has given to man as the principle of his physical development and moral and intellectual perfection. Man is placed upon the earth to cultivate it, to labour to embellish its existence and extend his power over nature. Q. What is the value of the principle of love ? A. Its power is indefinite; the desire of T.S.A.O.T.U. is to form the creature to love and be loved, and to rise to perfection by self love and the the love of humanity. Man loves, and it causes himself to place himself in harmony with God, with nature, with all intelligent beings, and with his conscience. Love is the first sentiment of a tender soul, the first want of the heart; God has given us this want as the principal guide of our life, and to be for the development of our interior nature. It is virtue only which ennobles love, and without it there is no true love upon earth; it is only the sensible and virtuous man who knows love truly; it is only a chaste woman, full of innocence, who can inspire and feel it. What would God, nature, and humanity be without love? What would the universe be without harmony? What would life, all existence, be without love? What would eternity be without the desire of always loving? Nothing. Love is then the soul of all existence. It is the principle of life and being; the immortal essence of the soul of organised beings, sensible and in telligent, the germ of interior and divine nature. The genrm of love is identical with the germ of life; it is by its power that T.S.A.O.T.U. creates, conserves, and regenerates all beings. Q. How dost thou understand interested man? A. Interest is a fruitful source of blindness and injustice; it knows no rule of truth, no measure of justice, but that which is useful to itself, and recognises no utility but that of the moment; man in order to justif y his excCesses changes good into evil and vice into virtue."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 246 Q. And liberty? A. Liberty is that power posse ssed by man to do all things which does not injure the rights of others; it has nature for its principle, justice for its rule, law for its safety, and its moral limit is governed by this maxim: Do not unto another that which thou wouldst not so wish should be done unto thyself. Q. What is the main source of our errors? A. The errors which the senses lead us into are most fatal, as they corupt the manner of judging those things which concern the morals. 1 The morality of the senses, if one may use such a term, is different from that of reason; sensuality, or abuse of the senses, brutifies man and distorts his mind under the pretext of rendering them more conformable to nature; it depraves his liking, makes men materialists, egotists, and leads them into all kinds of weakness and vice: he who drinks a long draught in the cup of voluptuousness will find at the bottom nothing but acrid remorse and the gall of repentance. Q. What is your opinion upon supreme intelligence? A. It is evident that the Great First Cause is omnipotent, since He has produced all things. As to His supreme intelli- gence, we can establish it upon analogical principles, which, if it does not give mathematical certainty, at least rejoices in an equivalent probability of certitude. All vegetables are born, nour ished, grow, and fall and die, but there lies in the molecules of the seed a conformation or principle of formation, which produces others, like the parent plant, by a mechanism proper for the reproduction. The animal nature generally has a double mecanism, for it encloses a thinking being in the body to which the intclligence is united, in such manner that whilst the two make but one 1 [Since this passage makes no sense as an attack on Empiricism I can only assume it has been mistranslated or that the word “senses” is being used with some meaning eccentric to the writer. Assuming “they” in the first sentence refers to “errors” and not “senses” it is still not clear how errors arising from misleading sense-data, or the misinterpr etation of sense-data, are peculiarly liable to corrupt the judgement in moral matters.]"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"SECOND SERIES , SECTION II ( AREOPAGUS ) 247 they act upon each other. Lastly, man is endowed with a mechanism much more per- fect than that of the other animals, which are born both armed and clothed. On the contrary, man comes into life naked and without weapons, and so is deprived at birth of the means of defence which nature furnishes to the brutes in order to defend themselves from the attacks of their enemies and the inclemencies of the weather. But man is endowed with that supreme facuIty of reason, which teaches him how to procure suitable clothing and powerful weapons, that he may be able to bring under his empire the strongest and most subtle animals: hence man exhibits the most perfect mechanism,—that of the vegetable is purely physical, that of the brute is physical and intellectual, that of man is physical, intellectual and moral. Q. What idea ought we to form of divine intelligence? A. We ought to form our ideas by analogy; it is the faculty of knowledge. God knows that He made, and why He made it; as to the manner in which He knew it analogy teaches us nothing; but it suffices to understand that the maker of a machine knows what he intends it to do, and should be able to work it in such a manner that the effect takes place which he intended; but the manner in which he knew this or in which he acted is not revealed to us. The universe is but a machine, the laws of movement are the same in all nature, and the smallest atom and the largest mass are equally submitted to these laws. We see that all things have been cast in the same mould, and, in principle, with a single design; from this we ought to conclude that the universe had one sole creator for its ordainer. Thus the first cause of all which exists is sovereign, intelli- gent, and powerful. There is but one Maker, and He is eternal.

Q. Does there exist in Masonry any secret independent of the formulæ and signs? A. Yes; some Brethren have still a knowledge of it; it has traversed time without experiencing any alteration, and exists now, as when, shut up in the mysterious Temples of Thebes and Eleusis, it excited the veneration of the world and still leaving the successors of the Hierophants to choose their dis- ciples. Many self-deceived persons suppose that our mysteries exist only in name; how can anyone understand them unless truly a Mason? If he is initiated in Masonic esotericism how can he call our secrets insignif icant? Our forms have been designedly introduced to veil the high philosophy of our system to common sprits, as well profanes as initiates; to prevent Masonry, so to say, being taken by storm in the symbolical degrees, it takes refuge in the superior, and thus to render access more difficult. The Mysthes, or initiates of antiquity, were divided into several secret classes, and the greater part possessed only signs and words. We must not therefore be astonished if the Chiefs of modern Masonry have followed their example. Our sublime Institution to be understood must be the study of a lifetime; it encloses all wisdom and science, if these two words are not always synonymous.

Q. Is it desirable to strive to possess all knowledge? A. Yes; for how can we re ach the full development of reason without meditation? This career is vast but dangerous; all men wish to enter upon it, but few carry with them so sure a light as to prevent them from wandering; study all those things which have been unveiled to us of nature, and the indestruc- tability of the human soul, and unite together the accumulate and victorious proofs of its immortality; endeavour to contract a clear and distinct idea of its principal faculties, as will, liberty, reason; seek to know the strength , habits and passions, in order to analyse and vanquish them, distinguishing that which is true from that which is false and deceiving; examining vice and virtue, happiness and misery—t hat which we are and that which we should be. This labour will induce luminous princi- ples, which will be the sure guides of our researches and our happiness. R EPLY .—The most precious gifts are accorded only to persev- erance.

A. The law of harmony, which ought to weld these contrary elements into one worthy of a correspondence to the work of the Great Unknown. Q. What is the aim of Masonry? A. Its aim is to render homage to a Supreme Power, unknown to the material sight and undistinguishable by the spirit, but conceivable to the heart by His benefits and the spectacle of the marvels of nature ; to enlighten men, that they may become sociable, just and good; to direct them in the way of virtue by affinity with their kind; to form under the empire of universal morality a wise doctrine which, by the sole ascen- dency of reason, holds men in a reasonable dependence, calcu- lated in the interests of all, and not in the interests of the few.

Then philosophy is the science of principles and the knowledge of truth? A. In its generality it embraces all the laws of the physical and natural world; for in the physical sciences philosophers have sought to find the origin of things, one attributing it to air, another to water, fire, atoms, thus constituting physics according to their own imaginations without finding truth. In the moral sciences they have essayed to settle the principles of logic, of metaphysics, and moral duties, together with the love of the marvellous. The Eclectic philosophy includes the enlightened men of the day; choosing whatever is demonstrable to their intelligences, and regretting all which cannot be so, and appro- priating all new truths. Q. What are the principles of the natural laws? A. The principles of the natu ral laws are those truths, or general propositions by which we are able effectually to under- stand the will of T.S.A.O.T.U. by a just and reasonable application of those laws Q. What should these principles be? A. They ought to be be true, simple, and sufficient; on the true foundation of the natural laws or the nature of man; they ought to be so simple that the mind can easily seize them; sufficient, because being the principles of our conduct it is necessary to understand all the consequences in particular cases. We must examine human nature in order to understand these principles. Q. What is the First Cause? A. That which depends on no other, as T.S.A.O.T.U. Q. And the second cause? A. That which depends on the First Cause, as all created causes. Q. And the immediate and mediate causes? A. The immediate cause is that which produces the effect by its action; the mediate is that whtch has produced the immediate. The father is the immediate cause of his children,"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 252 but the grandfather is the mediate cause. Q. And the physical cause, and the moral cause? A. The physical cause is that which contains the sufficient reason for a thing by its due action, it is the efficient cause considered under another point of view; the moral cause is that which exercises an influence by law upon the existence of a being, as by council or example. The effect, though really acting, does not always derive from the cause, because it often has need of a necessary condition: thus fire warms and burns combustible bodies, but only on condition that they approach its influence. Q. What is Spiritualism? A. Spiritualism is spirit as opposed to matter. The soul causes the body to submit to its power; it originates the prin- ciple of duty and the desire of immortality, the love of glory though virtue, and the acquisition of science; in our day it is called social progress; it is the conservator of true science, and the generator of noble thoughts, because the intellectual Eros is alone found in it; it is the archetype of the beautiful, because in disengaging men from worldly th ings which hold them captive it renders them more like the Being of Beings. This doctrine explains Magnetism, Somnambulism, dreams, prescience, sym- pathies, and antipathies. Q. What is Materialism? A. Materialism is the subjection of spirit to matter, or the victory of the senses over thought, 1 the negation of the docrine of immortality, and, it follows, the exaltation of the me , in other words, the canonisation of Egotism; it is consequently the duty of those who have accepted the mission to enlighten mankind, in whatever position they are, to appeal to Spiritualism as the ideal of human perfection, and the link between God and man. The Materialists corrupt society. 1 [It is an absurdity to assume the tw o opposed. Granted the existence of an external universe, in the absence of data from the senses thought has no material on which to work. In fact, the whole doctrine of the opposition of spirit and matter is a pernicious source of much human misery.]"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION I ( CONSISTORY ) 253 Q. Is it useful to man to understand the order of beings and of things, whether they be material, spiritual, visible or invisible, as God, nature, humanity, goodness, truth, virtue? A. Yes, for the highest degree of intelligence which man can attain is the knowledge of the nature of all being and their chain of affinity with ourselves; to understand the essence of thigns generally, and the quality of those objects intended for our instruction and for the development and perfection of our nature. Q. Why is philosophy an indispensible part of Masonry? A. Because all doctrine and morality, whether religious or scientific, that is not based on philosophy is false, and is apt to mislread even more than ignorance. Q. What is the tendency of the symbolical degrees of Masonry? A. To inspire the desire of moral perfection in the possessor, and the practice of all those virtues which make the good man. Q. What is the aim of the Capitular degrees? A. To give energy to the soul and to warm it with that holy enthusiasm which distinguishes the ardent philanthropist; the higher degrees teach the art of perfecting that which nature has left imperfect in mankind, and they recognise the truth of the symbolic and philosophical systems in the monuments and alle- gories of all ages and in the writings of the ancient Sages; hence it is necessary that Masons should be drawn to an ardent culti- vation of philosophy. Q. What think you concerning morality? A. Morality is the focal point of all human knowledge; it is the good way, the assured mean s of becoming happy and wise; it is the faithful mirror of virtue and the interpreter of con- science. Without morality all else is vanity, with it our actions become profitable and useful.

Q. How are we to became initiated in the first principles of knowledge. A. By carrying the primitive truths to the highest degree of evidence; the theory of being and existing, its possibilities, essence, properties, attributes, modifications, strength, duration, principles, causes, efforts, truths, perfections. Q. But these subjects exact a profound, methodic, and demonstrative discussion? A. Yes, they ought to be placed before weak intelligences through examples drawn from circ umstances in life, in order to render the study as easy as possible. Q. What is order? A. Orders is heaven’s first law. God governs by general, not particular laws; he gives equa l happiness to all, and to be happy man should be sociable. Q. What is providence? A. Providence is the free direction by an intelligent Being of all which happens in the world. Q. And preservation or conservation? A. Conservation is the continuation of the existence of beings subject to their physical and moral laws. Q. And chance? A. Chance is an effect arising without the intervention of providence, without cause, aim, or order. Q. And the end? A. The end is the sufficient reason which a free cause has determined for the production of its effects. We need not confound the end with the object, for it is the object which determines the end by the hope of its enjoyment. Q. And space? A. Space is an extension following the three dimensions—"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION I ( CONSISTORY ) 255 namely, length, breadth and thickne ss; if it is solid it is called body, and void if it contains no thing. Some assign four dimen- sions to space, as capacity. Q. And the infinite? A. The infinite is that which is without bounds; it is a negative term which marks that which is endless. Q. And duration? A. The duration of a being is the period of its existence: if the Being has neither beginning nor end it is called Eternal; if it has a beginning without having an end it is called immortal; lastly, the duration of a being which has both a beginning and an end is one of time. Q. And place? A. Place is some part of void space. Q. And movement? A. Movement is that action which transports a body from one place to another. Q. And matter? A. By matter I understand the constituents of the body which are of the same composition as the four elements. Q. And time? A. Time existed with God from eternity, but we can only conceive and reckon it from the point when God created movement and life. Q. Do you believe that the world was created by a being like ourselves? A. It cannot have been a being such as we are that created the world, for we are not able to create a worm; therefore the population of the universe is the work of an intelligence prodi- giously superior. Q. Does that Being who po ssesses intellige nce and power in so high a degree exist necessarily of Himself? A. Yes, it is necessary; for He must either have received existence from another, or it must be by His own nature. If He has received existence from another, which is difficult to con-"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 256 ceive, it then becomes necessary to recur to that other who will be First Cause; hence, whichever way we turn, it is necessary to accept a First Cause, powerful and intelligent, who is such in His own essence. Q. Has this First Cause produced all things from nothing? A. To create something from nothing is not conceiveable by us, for that is to change something into nothing; we ought not to admit this hypothesis until we find invincible reasons that force us to admit that which the mind is unable to comprehend. Q. Does it appear that all which exists now should exist of necessity? A. Yes; for if there is a reason for the existence of things to- day there was one yesterday; and hence there was one in all time; and the same cause ought still to have its effect, or it would have been useless in eternity. Q. But why should things exist visibly under the hands of a First Cause? A. As it is necessary that this power should have always acted, we will advance nearer: there is no sun without light; similarly, there can be no movement except there is a being or thing to pass from one point of space to another. Q. Has this powerful and intelligent Being always acted? A. If this Being had not always acted, what purpose would His existence have served? Q. Are all things the eternal creation of this First Cause? A. Yes, it seems to be so. Q. But how can we think that solid matter, such as stone and earth, are the creation of this eternal, intelligent and powerful Being? A. Of two views it is necessary to choose one; either the first matter of this stone or earth exist by their own essence, or by the First Cause. Q. Is it then impossible for these worlds to be without God, or God without the worlds; for our world is full of beings which"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION I ( CONSISTORY ) 257 succeed each other: God has then always preserved a succession of beings? A. Yes, it seems to be so. Q. Can something be produced by nothing? A. Nothing can produce nothing, hence all existing beings should have been produced by some existent being. Although a being cannot be produced by nothing, yet some things are drawn from things non-existing. Being physically composed are formed by the unity of ther parts, but beings physically simple and without parts cannot be produced by the union and arrangement of parts which they have not; they must be drawn from nothing by a power capable of producing them; to destroy them they must be reduced to nothing, as they cannot be destroyed by a separation of parts. The production of a simple being from nothing is called creation , the destruction of it is annihilation . A being or thing is produced from nothing of itself; creation is the production of a thing from nothing of itself, but when a workman produces a thing from material, he produces something from the object; for the foundation of his work existed in the material, but the workman gave it the necessary modification to show the object. Amongst created beings there can be but One who is Infinite, for on the contrary supposition these creations would be corporeal or spiritual, extended, solid, or simple; it is impossible for the same Being to be and to be not at the same time. The unity of the Infinitely Perfect Being has been generally recognised by all philosophers, in spite of their general disagree- ment on almost all other subjects. Even the Pagans, whilst freely accepting a plurality of Gods, admitted a Supreme God whom they regarded as infinitely perfect, but refeused such perfection to the minor deities. Nothing exists without a sufficient intrinsic and extrinsic reason of its possibility; for a being to exist it must be intrinsi- cally possible, and consequently th ere must be a sufficient reason for its essence and existence to ch aracterise its possibility. The"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 258 quicksands of the student is this knowledge of the sufficient reason of beings; in his researches he should ascend to their possibilities, and then learn their essential properties, and make a comparison of these; he ought to understand the forces necessary to produce them, and seek out the causes which are so powerful as to will their production; he ought to go still further, and learn their essentials and the resulting attributes; lastly, he ought not to ignore a reason for a being’s existence if he cannot comprehend it, for th e bounds of our understanding are limited. We must be careful not to arrive at conclusions without sufficient reason. The vulgar attribute events to chance, misfortune, or happiness; there is neither chance or happiness or anything of that kind in the sense in which they mean it; without exception all beings that exist have a reason that it is intrinsically possible for their existence; our ignorance does not authorise us in asserting that any beings are produced without cause. The principle of sufficient reason, although it is not the first principle of human knowledge, is none the less necessary and universal. It cannot be called the first principle, because the evidence is demonstarted by the contradictory argument. Nothing comes without sufficient reason. Q. How then, do you define beings? A. All beings in their physical formation are either simple or composite, for either the being has parts into which it is divisible, or it has not. There is no medium; in the one case it is composite, on the other simple. Q. What do you think regarding the annihilation of a simple substance? 1 A. The annihilation of a simple substance is its passing from existence to non-existence ; the contingent cannot give existence or take it away, for when the contingent destroys a composite being it is only necessa ry to separate the parts, it does not take away existence, and can only withdraw what it gives. This power belongs only to that eternal Being to whom 1 [ e = m × c 2 ]"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION I ( CONSISTORY ) 259 creation and annihilation of things appertain. A simple sub- stance is indestructible by its nature, for it cannot perish by the action of contingent beings, because there is no action without reaction, and no reaction without solidity. Q. And of the perfection of beings? A. The knowledge of the perfecting of beings is above our comprehension; perfection consists in the assemblage of all qualities. and in the convenience of these qualities to the desti- nation of such being, but it is evident that this knowledge sur- passes the sphere of our unders tanding. The judgement which we pass upon the perfection or imperfection of beings is a rela- tive judgment. We see that some qualities are more estimable than others; it seems to us that one being answers its purposes better than another; we then pass our judgment on their rela- tive perfection or imperfection, but we can never do this in an absolute manner, for it surpasses our capacity. Q. How can we reckon upon time? A. The time which we can count upon is but an instant, for the past does not exist and the present will not exist again; hence our life consists of a moment, and this idea is a very proper one to show our nothingness, and persuade us to renounce the seducing pleasures of the world. Q. What is movement? A. Movement is the modification of a body, and conse- quently of a real and positive thng, and as repose is a modifica- tion opposed to movement it follows that repose is a negative thing consisting in the simple deprivation of movement. Matter cannot put itself in motion, because movement being a modification of matter, it can pa ss into repose without losing anything of its nature, but it has need of an external cause to determine its motion by the communication of force, which is sufficient reason. Q. Is movement essential to matter? A. Yes, for all nature moves; the sun turns continually on its axis, the planets do the same. The hardest metal is pierced"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 260 with an infinite number of pores, by which vapours continually escape and circulate in space. All the universe is in motion, hence movement is essential to matter. Q. Notwithstanding this, a house or a mountain does not move? A. They move in their pasage through space with the earth; moreover in the lapse of ages, there will remain nothing of them, for the particles are being constantly detatched. Q. But if I can conceive of matter in repose, motion is not in its essence? A. I say that it cannot be in repose. Q. That is bold; and what, then, was chaos? A. If you speak of chaos, I reply that everything was necess- arily in movement, and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. The existence of the watery element is recog- nised, the other elements also, hence fire, and there is no fire without its essential motion. Q. What makes one body to press upon another? A. Because matter is impen etrable, and two bodies cannot occupy the same space; amongst all people the weak are expelled by the strong. Q. What is the force of a body in motion? A. It is the product of the mass by its velocity; the mass of a body being 4 and its velocity 4 , the force of its blow is 16 ; it is a principle of mechanics. 1 Q. Do you believe that fixity and law have always existed? A. Yes, God living, God being, there was necessarily a basis for Him to be, to live, and to act:—this life, this action should have a resulting effect. Q. Where is this intelligent Being? 1 [This is nonsense. In Newtonian mechanics, force = mass × acceleration , or, force = rate of change of moment um. The formula in the text is for momentum . It is meaningless to predicate ‘force’ of a body moving with constant velocity. The force of the impact (in the simple case where the impacting body comes to a complete ha lt) is, on average, the momentum of the impacting body divided by the time it takes to slow to a stop.]"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION I ( CONSISTORY ) 261 A. Since this intelligence is Creator, one finds traces of Him everywhere; there is an incessant organisation of matter and continual progresses. That which is produced to-day is not as it was formerly, nor do former things exist; for nothing that exists, whether forms or edifices, stars or suns, however immense and admirable they may be, nothing of that which composes the elements or sets out from the hands of the Creator is imperishable, and constituted for eternity in its present form: thus wills the Supr eme Being, who is the Father of all increase and progression; all the globes had a beginning, all should therefore have an end—the Supreme Being alone is eternal and immutable. Q. Touching locally in a division of space, or the region embracing the senses; let us consider whether the stars which surround and enlighten us were not, in their origin, a compact mass, and whether a mixed or a simple element constituted the four? How did the stars originate. A. I believe that the globes were successively formed by the vital and creative act of that Spirit designating the points where matter was concentrated; for if there was a first idea, or a first among beings, there was doubtless a first globe, and the multi- tude of suns which roll over our heads had their first-born. Q. Has matter a limit? A. Yes, in its weight and volume, but not in augmentation or diminution, or in extension, which ought only to be bounded by immensity where it can dilate to infinity. Q. Does matter exist everywhere in space? A. A void nowhere exists, or if it does exist it is but partially and for a time. Q. Then spirit finds everywhere the proper material to individualise or work? A. I consider that the faculty and will of the spirit is unceasingly active. and that each moment ought to see worlds newly born; if eternity is there to produce them, infinite space is there to contain them. In proportion as organisation begins to"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 262 operate, worlds are designed and the materials concentrated, the confused mass begins to ferment, the lightest part floats upward and the heaviest sink to form the centre; the fluid part. being composed of air, fire, water and earth, excessively dilated, give rise to the four distinct elements. The firsr produced should be fire, and perhaps from this the action proceeds; after this air and water; but the elements and the solid crust will only be gradually constituted by the action of heat and warmth. The first ray of heat, or perhaps the first electric spark, penetrates the mass and produces motion and amalgamation. for fermentation is produced by this burning contact; with boiling dissolution. The stars also burn and explode in their revolutions or dilate into impalpable essence. Q. Then there are broken or pulverised globes which formed part of a more considerable star? A. I repeat that nothing composed of matter is eternal in its form. These agglomerated fragments, whether frozen or burning, rounded by their rotatory movement, cooled by immobility or warmed by by shock, become at length suitable to form the basis of life in which the soul or vital essence may constitute beings with apt organs to act on this same matter. The cooling of a star which loses its proper warmth, or internal caloric, is sometimes arrested by its vicinity to another to which it is attracted, for these globes act and inflame in proportion as the cause extends to the whole or part. Fire can no more be annihilated than the other elements; it may change its form, locality, action, or its food. Warmth and light do not appear to be the same thing, but the fire of the sun is identical with that of the earth; for the combustion which we can produce by a spark drawn from flint is identical with that which we bring from the sun by using a glass to concentrate its rays. 1 Q. Is there a first matter? 1 [Genitive fallacy. Much in these lectures strikes a modern reader as the comical result of trying to apply Aristotelean metaphysics to the natural science of the late nineteenth century. The mistake in this instance is of course to treat ‘fire’ as a substance rather than a process.]"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION I ( CONSISTORY ) 263 A. Yes; this matter exists when the actual form of the body is destroyed, for nothing can be annihilated: it is evident that there is something in nature which is hidden under the form of the thing, and which is called the substratum; this is not engen- dered, neither is it annihilated, by corruption; it is that which is called first matter , uncreated matter, eternal, infinite, indes- tructible. By modern scientists, the first recognizable basis of life has been called protoplasm , which is a species of foam possessing irritability, or life, and is composed of gases; it is the vegetating cause of plants and the basis of animal life; but the directing intelligence, or soul, of this formless substance, escapes the probe of the experimentalist. Q. Then first matter exists everywhere under some form? A. There is no void in nature; matter is everywhere; it cannot exist without form somewhere; there is no space with- out body; space is eternal, immobile, and immovable. Q. How many natural principles are there? A. Five; matter, form, soul, space, movement. Q. How many first qualities? A. There are but two; namely, warmth and moisture. Q. Is time a principle? A. No; but it approaches it, because nothing can be done without it; repose is not a prin ciple, but the privation of a principle, as death, cold, dryness. Q. Do you think that the universe is animated by the three alchemical principles—salt, sulphur, and mercury? A. Yes. Q. How many things are eternal in their nature? A. Three; namely, intelligence, first matter, and space; the quantity of matter always remains the same. Q. Do you think it advisable to observe in man the confor- mation of the solids, the movement of fluids, and the play of the passions? A. I believe it is useful to science. Q. Do you believe that the Divinity has left each man his"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 264 independence, in order that he may become that which he makes himself. Is it not for this end that He has put between each being a barrier of order and law? A. Yes, for if we reflect upon the admirable equilibrium which exists between the power of the Creator and man’s res- ponsibility, does it not prove the greatness of the Divine presence and His infinite intelligence? How can we miscon- ceive that living force which, in its universality, maintains order amongst such disorderly elements, diverse interests and wills moved by opposing passions? Q. In a life without future, with justice and injustice as an outwork, on a globe where each inhabitant is isolated, would not equity be useless? A. Yes; for what purpose would equity serve if there was nothing to share? Q. In such case, would a kn owledge of God or vice and virtue be useful? A. No; the knowledge of a future life to which the creature would not be called would become a burthen all the more heavy as it would be aimless, and nothin g of all that which subsists is without aim. Q. Is the faculty of the will as immortal as the soul? A. It constitutes the strength and life of the soul; it weighs justice and injustice, and separates the true from the false; it is the will alone which constitutes independence. Q. What is will? A. Will is the principle of all actions, the moving power in all organisation; wherever an organisation exists a will has acted or acts. Q. What is the inequality of creatures? A. The inequality of creatures has nothing absolute in it, no definite arrest; all in nature is part of the same plan, all part of the same essence; that which one is able to do, the other is able to do, or can try; free to approach the same end, which is God; their difference in form and intelligence springs from the"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION I ( CONSISTORY ) 265 employment which they make of their common faculites. Q. What is wisdom? A. It is the fruit of experience. Q. What is experience? A. Experience is acquired, not by action but by reflection upon our actions; he who does not reflect gathers not the fruits; after dragging the burthen of year s, he loses his life and only perceives that he has become old by his infirmities. Q. Do you believe in the soul’s immortality, and that it is an analogue or emanation of Divinity? A. Yes; God is truth; all that lives should have an affinity with this virtue. Q. What is individuality? A. It is the soul; the soul is immortality—it is eternity; it is that me , which can slumber but never cease to be; it has its periods of repose and vicissitudes, its increases and decreases, but the ego remains. Free and immortal, moved by grief and necessity, the will can embrace worlds and raise itself even to God. It is this free will which constitutes independence; thought makes the will and that does the work. Zoroaster said that man was a trinity of thought, word and deed—pure in the pure, evil in the evil. Q. What is thought, or its essence, reduced to a rudimentary type? A. Hippocrates and Plato contended that thought is a mix- ture and indivisibility. Q. Is it an exclusive force, an ether, a vapour, or aphlogiston ? Is it a ray, a flame, or a breath? A. Thought is a fiery fluid pneuma , says Plutarch; a fusion of earth and water, says Anixam ander; a fire, says Heraclitus; an atom, an indesectable, says Lucrece; a part of God, taught Socrates; thought is an harmony, says Aristodemus; a celestial flame, says Zeno; or that which is not less subtle, a number mvoed by itself, explained Pythagoras. Q. Is it simple?"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 266 A. Thought is a mosaic of appetitive faculties and pre- horescent faculties, said the school of the Portico; a magazine of perceptions and wishes, says Mallebranche; thought is the influx of the soul, said Stahl, and, before him, Anexagoras. I find none of these explanations satisfactory. Q. Is thought material or immaterial? A. Thought is neither material nor immaterial, pretends Hobbes and Pyrrhon, amongst the ancients: it is not then. Such is the language of a fool who maintains that he is dead. 1 Man feels that he is, he thinks an d he is certain that he thinks, by this only, that he thinks it. Thought exists, then, in the proof that its existence is crushed; that is—the denial of thought is itself a thought. Q. How can God be comprehended? A. Being a pure Spirit absolutely distinct from matter He can be comprehended only by thought or Spirit. Q. What is life? A. Life is nothing more than an organised permenant struggle with the interior and exterior world, a continual series of actions and reactions and of reciprocal vicissitudes between an individual and the rest of the molecules; resistance is the condition of life; all philosophy ho lds to the conception that life is but an affinity. There is no spirit without discernment, because there can be no notions without comparison. To understand is to distinguish, to distinguish is to judge, and to judge is to know; hence to know all is but a parallel, and no object is opportune in itself; the perception of that which may be is only the valuation of what the thing is capable of doing which is no other than what it is .

What is life without death? four letters. Q. What is death? A. Death is the sovereign proprietor of all things. Empires are effaced under its steps, it extinguishes even the stars. Death is sleep! It is an awakening, perhaps! Q. What is sympathy? A. It is that harmonv which exists between sensible and intelligent beings; it ts the divin e, interior principle of man. The soul feels that which is divine and unites itself even to divinity; it feels still more that which is human, and thus sentiment unites it to humanity. Sympathy is the principle which forms interior man, and is that which makes his soul, heart and spirit. The man whom sympathy has formed, according to this sublime ideal has an intimate comprehension of interior nature; he has a pure conscience with reason enlightened by celestial light, a heart filled with love, strong affections, generous sentiments, and an enlightened spirit which is enriched with profound ideas and an extended knowledge, because all has co me to him from impressions which he has received, either from nature and beings in general or men. Sympathy in short can bring about the happiness of all mankind as it originates the harm ony of sensible beings; we can have no conception of the happiness which it is capable, one day, of spreading among the human race; but the prodigious things which it has at times manifested may be found in striking examples among the ancient nations, and in the actions of great men, and the writings of the wise of all nations. Q. What is signified by the emblematical tomb? A. Death and immortality; also to die to vice and be reborn to virtue. Q. In what does the primitive religion consist? A.

It is necessary to give proofs of courage, greatness of soul, firmness of character, and to feel one’s self capable not only of resisting the elements , vanquishing the world and the passions, but ourselves also. More over it is necessary to know that our institution is a school of virtue and that it exacts of its adepts all those moral and phil osophical qualities which most contribute to the happiness of humanity. Q. What do you understand by humanity? A. This word implies strength , goodness, and manly virtue. It enfolds three essential ideas. The first gives us the idea of a divine manifestation in human nature, advancing man to the highest degree of virtue; in the second sense the word expresses the sentiment of love towards God and our neighbour, charity, pity, benevolence, generosity, magnanimity, and all the divine and human virtues; in the third sense, the word covers the whole of the human kind, and is allusive to the great family of which we are all members in the like quality of men and brothers, and equally children of good and of nature. Q. How does the love of humanity manifest itself? A. By the love of perfection and virtue, by truth and justice, but above all in generous actions. The divine law of humanity is an impartial law of love twoards all men, a sacred law which ought to be the only code of mankind. Q. What is a Sublime Master of the Great Work? A.

Q. What is the nature of his instruction? A. A pure and noble philosophy, which, though unmys- terious, is symbolical. It teaches the doctrine of the unity of God, the art of understanding and explaining the essence and operations of the Supreme Being, the spiritual and natural forces and the determination of their action by emblematical figures. It is, in fact, the key of that occult science which we ought to cultivate. Q. What do you comprehend by occult sciences? A. The occult sciences reveal to man the mysteries of his nature, the secrets of his organization, and the means of attaining perfection and happiness. Q. Is the soul of man representative? A. Yes, each soul is a living mirror, endowed with an internal action, which is representative of the universe in all points of view. Q. What is psychology? A. It is that part of philosophy which treats of the faculties of the soul and its operations. Psychology is the science of soul, and is the first step of that immense ladder which we must necessarily climb in order to un derstand truth; but to arrive there it is necessary, from the first to the last step, to be a man in the presence of that nature which will impress his mind in the fullness of its action. It is necessary also to be exempt from scientific and religious prejudices; science generally excludes politics and religion in order to be one and universal. Q. And physiognomy? A. It teaches us how to co mprehend the inner man and his character and inclinations by his exterior looks. Q. Do you consider Materialism and Atheism the same thing? A. No; Materialism is improper ly called Atheism. The last is an inconceivable thing; to be an Atheist is to suppose that"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION II ( COUNCIL ) 271 effect can take place without cause; for it is this First Cause of which all exists whom we call God, or the unknown Cause of the known effects. How, then, can such a thing as an Atheist exist? The only difference which exists among men of good faith is on the question whether the Cause is spiritual or material; that is to say, isolated and in dependent of matter or intrin- sically inherent to matter and making an intergral part of it. But a Materialist is not an Atheist. Q. What is truth? A. There are three sorts of truth—natural or metaphysical truth, moral truth, and logical tr uth. Natural or metaphysisical truth is the similitude which the essence of beings have to their model; moral truth is the similitude which our thoughts bear to the words which express them, and to speak in conformity to the natural laws; logical truth is the similitude which our ideas have to the essence of things which those ideas represent. Q. Are truth and happiness incompatible? A. No; I believe that one necessarily conducts to the other. Q. Why, then, do not men seek truth with more ardour? A. Either from indolence of thought or the fear of serious reflection; else from defective principles, want of belief or incredulity. Q. What is abstract good? A. Good is that which contributes to the advantage of any being; the idea of good is relative, for, properly speaking, abso- lute good is absolute perfection. Good is real or apparent. Real good is that which contributes to the perfection and happiness of another; apparent good is th at which has only the appearance of these advantages, and which will really contribute to the un- happiness of those who seek it. The cultivation of reason can alone make real good to be understood and distinguish it from apparent good; for it is reason alone which can lead us, by a just calculation, to understand the value and price of things and appraise the relation of objects to our perfection and happiness. Q. And tendency or penchant ?"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 272 A. Penchant is a strong inclination towards good which is perceived or felt. On the contrary, we give the name of aver- sion to all that which estranges us from evil. The first is the effect of a sensation which attracts us towards good, the second is the revulsion which we feel at the sight of evil. Likes and dis- likes are necessary and natura l symptoms, independent of liberty, for they are the result of the laws of self-preservation. Q. What do you understand by moral liberty? A. The moral liberty of man consists in the faculty which we have of suspending our judgements and our actions until we have maturely examined the subject by using all possible means to arrive at the knowledge of the true and the false, good and evil. Q. And will ? A. Will is the final determination of the soul when it deter- mines to embrace the good or fly the evil which is perceived in the subjects which occupy the thou ghts; it is, therefore, the will which determines after the light of the understanding and the use of liberty of action. We deceive ourselves when we attri- bute to liberty the faculty of choosing, it only enlightens the will when the light of the understanding is insufficient; this error is produced by confoun ding moral liberty with natural liberty as opposed to force; the more the soul is enlightened and the more free it is, because it has better means by which to arrive at the knowledge of good and evil; liberty is then propor- tioned to reasonable education, which enlightens the soul and furnishes the means of discovering the true and the false, the good and the evil. Q. And reason? A. Reason is the faculty of appreciating proportions, proba- bilities, or evidences. We term those reasoning beings which have these three faculties probable or evident, and nothing is reasoning which lacks these principles, but their number changes not with the nature of reason. Q. And the passions?"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION II ( COUNCIL ) 273 A. Everything living or animate have sensations, or what are called passions. 1 Each passion being the expression of a want; there are gestures and physiognomical expressions which correspond with the exigencies of our organic and moral existence. These passions are arranged into four classes— tranquil and agreeable, sad and dolorous, violent and terrible passions. Admiration belongs to the first class, desire to the second, fear to the third, and anger to the forth. Admiration is surprise at some object which the soul considers, with attention, as rare or extraordinary. Desire is an agitation of soul which is disposed to wish for things which it considers convenient. We desire both the presence of absent good and the preservation of present good. Anger is a passion which successively excites grief and audacity. this brings us to those passions, almost noble, which spring from boldness, and of which assurance is the basis. Audacity goes further and higher, and is more passionate than the others, and with more of transport in its disorderly movements; courage is more calm and reflecting; temerity launches blindly into the midst of perils. Next follow effrontery an d insolence, which, though of a less noble character, belong to the same family. Q. What do you understand by God and His attributes? A. I understand by the term God, a necessary and eternal 1 [This is either a bad translation, or a misleading expression in the original. (In any case the entire passage is bad psychology.) The ‘Passions’ of 18 th and 19 th century proto-psychology ( e.g. in the sense of the second book of Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature ) are more or less the same as the ‘emotions’ of later ‘scientific’ psychology and distinct fr om direct sense-da ta (Hume’s ‘impres- sions’ include both) which is what a mode rn reader would tend to think of as the primary meaning of ‘sensations.’ The early modern notion of ‘the passions’— vide the etymology of the word, from passus , participle of patior , ‘suffer’ whence also the ‘passive’ voice of grammar—is that they are things which happen to one rather than being under the control of conscious will. “We speak not strictly and philsophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason.

The infinite wisdom of God consists of an adequate knowledge of the present, futures, and the possible. T.S.A.O.T.U. has the power to constitute everything by an act of His own will. Q. How do you explain the existence of God? A. We demonstrate the evidence of God’s existence by three kinds of reasoning: the first is drawn from the existence of beings, 1 the second from the science of nature, 2 and the third from philology, or the history of man and his establishments. 3 There exists one God, who is eternal, and the source and principle of all beings. He is immutable and infinitely perfect; His essence is simple and incorporeal, existing by his own nature and from all eternity as the being whom we called T.S.A.O.T.U. This demonstration is without repl y, because it is supported on certain principles. The arguments drawn from creation, which may be brought from all parts of the world, prove the existence of God in an evident manner. Without going beyond ourselves, man could only be the production of an infinite wisdom. Two substances of a diametrically opposite nature form a composi- tion of which we admire the effect, without being able to under- stand the union. The senses report to our souls all which passes without; that takes instant cognizance and determines. The soul ordains, the body obeys. This communion, which is less intelligible than admirable, forms the most perfect being in nature. The body, which executes the will of the soul, is a 1 [Possibly an allusion to the so-called cosmological argument, based on the supposed impossibility of an infinite caus al series; even if granted, it only establishes a First Cause and does not provide a shred of evidence for this having all of the traditional attributes of God.] 2 [Presumably a reference to the Argument from Design, which even if granted would only prove the Demiurge— vide Hume, Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding , cap. XI.] 3 [I am unsure what this refers to; the widespread belief in the existence of a God is an interesting question in human psychology, but the idea that the presence of this belief is itself evidence for its truth is a manifest absurdity of a kind with Descartes’ ‘idea of God’ argument in the third Meditation .]"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION II ( COUNCIL ) 275 machine, of which the least of its parts indicate a wisdom above all imagination. When we cast a glance upon the structure of the external senses, and examine the different functions which occasion the impressions which are made by external objects, we must be ravished by admiration and respect for the Creator. But if we examine the totality of the body, of which the details will ever be a mystery, even for the most enlightened genius, what a subject of astonishment and admiration, even if we only consider it in the light of so much matter! There are such a variety of natural parts, figures, and different qualities, that the mind is bewildered. There is the hard and dry material for bone, fluids for the humours, humid and tender parts for the flesh, tenacious matter for the nerves, tubes for the veins and arteries, the hot parts for the liver and heart, cold for the brain, and transparent for the eyes. It can be nothing but a habit of forgetfulness of the Creator which prevents our ascending to Him by the contemplation of His marvels. Q. Believest thou that we are created for immortality? A. Yes, for we are the emanation of the Sovereign Power, and we have somewhat of His goodness; and if we love Him and are pure, we return to Him. But we ought to form ourselves for the love of the beautiful, the good, the true, and the just, and raise ourselves to the Temple Saphenath Pancah to make our eternal residence there. Q. How can we understand the divine? A. By a knowledge of nature. That which humanity knows is also known to the divinity which is in man. Q. Do you believe in the existence of a chain of beings? A. Yes; I see that there is an admirable gradation in the different classes of beings, and that there is no leap in nature, that there are innumerable affinities between the different parts of the universe. For example, the position of the sun relatively to the earth affords us a worthy subject of astonishment and admiration. Suppose this vast body removed either farther off or brought nearer to us, the heat would necessarily be either"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 276 too weak or too strong, and the earth would be either frozen with cold or burnt up with heat, and would lose it properties of maintaining plants, animals an d men. The name may be remarked of the degree of brilliancy which the sun gives to our eyes; and there are numberless such things. 1 Q. Dost thou believe that there are celestial spirits who form an invisible chain between man and God, like that which exists between man and the brutes? A. Yes; I believe that celestial intelligences avowed by the most ancient and universally spread traditions, pure spirits who are enlightened by the divine fire and burn with holy love are elevated by degrees even to the throne of His glory, and are ministers of His wishes to the intelligences of this world. All these spirits, disengaged as th ey are from matter, continue, nevertheless, the chain of beings, and form a new one among themselves, such as is offered to our contemplation in this world of material beings. Over all this change of beings presides T.S.A.O.T.U., holding th e thread of destiny and will- ing the happiness of all His creatures according to the measure convenient to them and their merits, answering their prayers and ministering to their wants. Q. How do you apply the occult sciences to Magianism? A. The occult science, or rege nerative fire, as it was termed by the ancient priests, is what, in our day, is termed animal magnetism, a science which was for more than fifty centuries the appanage of the Hierophants. It has been termed “a piece broken from a great palace, a ray of Adamic power sent to con- found human reason and humilia te it before God.” Upon it depended the phenomena belonging to the order of Prophets, and the relative powers of weak man and the All-powerful Jehovah. The knowledge of the magnetic fluid is a most pre- cious gift of Providence; it is the mysterious key which opens to 1 [The fallacy here is broadly th at exposed in my note on p. 242 .

Invisible to the eyes of the senses, it is necessary to study it by the light of the soul, and to partake of the somnambulic or ecstatic state. This is no new science, but has been transmitted by Theosophic societies in Engl and and India from the earliest times to the present; it is the Yoge of the Brahmin. There exists a very subtle magnetic fluid or radiant matter, which forms the bond between soul and body; without any particular seat, it circulates in all the nerves, but more especially the grand sympathetic nerve, and forms the life spirit; its hue is that of fire or electricity, hence the name given it of living fire in the works of the Persian magi, and intimate star in those of the those of the alchemists and astrologers of the middle ages. One of its principal virtues is its re generative; the Sacred Books give it the name of the regenerating fire, soul of the world, universal spirit spread through all nature. It forms the vital essence of all bodies animated by it, of all beings in which it is incarnate, and is greatly modified by the medium through which it passes. Q. What did the ancient nations think upon astrology? A. The sciences of astronomy and astrology were intimately connected, the one being particular and the other general knowledge. The positions of the stars were accurately noted, and the physical effect of the sun’s passage through the twelve signs of the Zodiac observed and recorded; as also the effects of comets and eclipses. They carefully noted the various effects of the laws of gravitat ion, magnetism, electricity, magnets and metals, chemistry, the action of the moon upon the tides, the density and chemical action of the light shed by different planets. From these observations they drew the deduction that each star held its particular influence on some part of the earth, and that God had set the stars in the heavens"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 278 to regulate all things, and over each of the stars a ruling angel was placed, who had dominion over that part of the world in which the particular star had the greatest influence; and as man was a world in miniature they mapped out the various parts of his body in a similar way. We read, for instance, in the book of Daniel, of the angel who had dominion over Persia— Michael, or Mithras, who was ruler of the sun. The poshion of the planets at a man’s birth was carefully noted, and the dominant power, hyleg, or giver of life, was considered as the regulator of the future disposition and career, for it was the influence which conferred, magnetically, upon the newly-born the breath of life, and maintained its influence so long as the individual lived; moreover, each of his limbs was in correspondence with some particular planet, and form these things health or sickness was predicted. Properly understood, the science of astrology is a sublime speculation upon the glorious works of T.S.A.O.T.U. Some Masons assert that the triple Tau and interlaced double triangles are the keys by which to open up the celestial intelli- gence which the Hierophants have placed emblematically upon the celestial charts; they certainly give extraordinary results, for the relative positions of the stars are slowly changing. Q. And upon the healing art? A. The ancients studied the art of curing disease by planetary influences and by plants correlative to the part of the body affected, and the same custom is followed to this day in India. It is thus that the basil, the lavender, and the saffron are indi- cated for curing diseases of the stomach, because the viscera is under the dominion of the lion, and these three plants corre- spond to that sign. They also employed plants of which the configuration had some similitu de to the parts of the human body affected. Thus, the roots of the anthora represent two hearts united, and was by this indicated for heart diseases; the camomile passed for an opthalmic plant, because the flower has some resemblance to the human eye. These observations upon similitudes extended also to the colour of the sap, the taste,"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION II ( COUNCIL ) 279 smell and touch. Moreover, the number of their leaves, petals, stems, and the knots upon the trunk, bring them under the dominion of such planets, and therefore ever presented some new source of instruction to the astrological doctors. These affinities of the three kingdoms of nature with the astrological conjectures of the Hierophants, who had thus determined the concordance which man held between the three kingdoms of nature, the elements and the celestial bodies, prove that if they sometimes erred in the system of interpretation which they had established, they at least, pushed their observations very deeply into nature. They made use of the Sybils in obtaining a knowledge of a number of plants, with their therapeutic properties, as well as in the arcana of chemistry, anatomy and numerous secrets of nature. Q. What is the origin of hieroglyphics? A. The general opinion is, that the first characters which were employed to register th oughts, were emblematical, and borrowed from the labours of agriculture, the proceedings of the useful arts, or astronomical observations; the hieroglyphical alphabet is the representation of thought by images, and there- fore, should long precede a syllabic alphabet, which consists essentially in the decomposition of the elements of a word, and in the grouping of these elements to form a word. It is to Egpyt that we owe this system of hieroglyphics and an alphabet, in common with other useful knowledge. 1 The greater part of the monuments which cover that land are covered with hiero- 1 [The Egyptian hieroglpyhic script, at least in the classic Middle Kingdom stage, is a mixture of the alphabetical , syllabic and ideographic. The Latin alphabet almost certainly derives via the Greek from the Phœnician conso- nantal script (also the prototype for the Hebrew alphabet) whose connection with Egyptian is unclear; it has been sought in the past to derive it from Egyptian ‘hieratic’ writing (a cursive script in which the picture-symbols of the hieroglyphs have become stylised and simplified, and so can be written more quickly), but this theory does not seem generally favoured. Greek was earlier written with a syllabic script no w known as Linear B, but this fell out of use with the fall of Minoan Crete and has no known descendants.]"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 280 glyphical signs, and were used to give relative indications to the labours of agriculture, the inundations of the Nile, preserve the remembrance of remarkable events, and hallow the memory of those sovereigns who illustrated their reign by the rise of useful and glorious institutions. All the primitive nations were accus- tomed to symbolise great accidents of nature and high philo- sophical speculations and to build fables thereon, which were accepted in their literal form by the vulgar, whilst the true interpretation was communicated only to the initiates; it was thus that they symbolised nature in Isis and the impenetrability of its mysteries in the veil which enveloped her statue, and which was never entirely withdrawn even to the eyes of the Hierophants; 1 it is thus, again, that the Greeks symbolised high science by the Sacred Curtain in the Temple of Apollo. Before hieroglyphics were invented, the Chinese used cords covered with knots of which each recalled an event. On the discovery of the New World it was found that the Mexican nations equally used the quipos , or registers of cords, the knots being formed of different colours and combined together, by which symbols they recorded the public revenue, imposts, and annals of the empire. Amongst the Chinese Fo-hi, in the year 3327 B . C ., replaced the system of cords by written characters, and he also invented the eight kouas —each kouas consisting of three lines, half of which are whole and half broken into two parts, and which in their various combinations are supposed to represent the active and 1 [This is probably an over-interpretat ion by Plutarch or another late Greek writer. It was apparently a general custom in the official Egyptian cults that the statues of the gods were ‘dressed up’ by a dedicated priest, but the ‘veiled Isis’ was probably not Isis at all, except in a late syncretic phase, but rather Neith. Similarly the philosophical and allegorica l interpretations of the myths around the Greek gods belongs to a late stage; specifically to Porphyry and other later Platonists, who were engaged in a de sperate and unfortunately doomed rearguard action to reform, purify and philosophically justify classical Greek paganism in opposition to Christianity. Plato, by contrast, while not averse to using myths (usually cosmogonic or esch atological) in the course of his teach- ings, violently denounces (specifically in the Republic ) many of the traditional poetic myths (such as those of Homer) as wholly unworthy of the gods.]"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION II ( COUNCIL ) 281 passive principles of the universe in all their forms. They believe that the first idea of a written character was taken from the impressions of the tracks of birds upon the sand. Tsang-hi, minister of Koang-tze, called his characters Ki-tehoun, and these served as the form for their first hieroglyphics. Q. What are the religious and philosophical views of the Chinese? A. The religuous opinions of this ancient people are worthy of notice; like the followers of Moses they were divided into two chief sects, namely the Saducees or followers of Confucius, the Moses of China, 1 living about the year 578 B . C ., and the followers of his contemporary Lao-tze, who was the leader of the Tao-se, or spiritualistic sect. The most ancient of their books recognise a divine or Supreme Being. Their philosophical system holds that there is one ultimate principle of all existence—the Tae- Kieh,—or Grand Extreme. From this highest principle, which has operated from eternity, springs all animate and inanimate nature. It operates in a two-fold way by expansion and contrac- tion; the active, expansive, pulsation is called yang , and the passive, or intense pulsation, is yin , and are the positive and negative essence of all things. The one tends to variety, the other to unity, and variety and unity is a permanent and universal law of existence. Man is the result of the utmost development of this pulsatory action and passion, and hence his high nature, perfectly good, consists of five elements,—charity, justice, propriety, wisdom, and sincerity. The positive and negative energy of which the Ke or breath of nature is composed, is termed the azure dragon and the white tiger; every elevation or depression of ground indicates the presence of one or other of these magnetic currents, the excess of either of which is destructive to health. 1 [A closer analogy would be with Ezra, who redacted the various traditions and floating fragments of scripture am ong the post-Captivity Jews into the Torah. While Kung-fu-tze (Confucius) wrote much original material, the five ‘classics’ he issued were, or at least wer e claimed to be, redactions of material of much greater age.]"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 282 Q. What is the Masonic culte? A. That of Socrates, of the gospel, and of all good men; that direct religion which comes from the Creator to His creature, good works and pious gr atitude; Masonry desires that all the world should be enlightened, 1 because there is then more of reason, and less of error and prejudice; the more one knows the less one errs, and the more men are instructed the more they are drawn to each other. Q. What relation does Masonry hold to Egypt? A. Masonry, considered as a secret society with peculiar ceremonies, having for its aim the conservation of knowledge, truth, and their laws, was received and perpetuated in Egypt by the Sages, who concealed their attainments from the vulgar by clothing them in ingenious emblems; from the banks of the Nile the system was carried to the Greeks, Romans and other ancient nations, where it more or less lost its character and primitive aim. All the old operative constitutions of the Freemasons trace their origin to Egypt; the secret sects of Gnostics did the same, also the Templars and Hermetic Philosophers, whose descendants the modern Masons are. Q. Have you any knowledge of Symbols? A. I have studied the language of Symbols. Q. Will you show me what you have learnt. A. (He gives the lecture of a Patriarch of Isis.) Q. What was taught by the ancient Mysteries? A. It was a marvellous institution; the school of the people and the seminary to which all the Legislators repaired for in- struction; its worship was of a simple nature and taught the initiate to purge himself of superstition and adore one Supreme God, the eternal Creator, who preserved His work by an incessant destruction and new re production; as the institution taught the immortality of the soul, the initiates regarded life as 1 [This seems difficult to square with the glorification found throughout these ‘lectures’ of secretive and élitist Mystery-Cults who jealously guarded what little knowledge they possessed from the ‘profane,’ i.e. those who hadn’t paid the requisite fees and dues to their hierophants.]"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"THIRD SERIES , SECTION II ( COUNCIL ) 283 a moment of exile. The wisdom of Egypt became the proverb of all nations, and the greatest sovereigns and philosophers sought initiation; Minos, Lycurgus, Solon, Zaleucas, and Pythagoras, quitted their homes and repaired to Memphis to learn and teach the science of governing men, which was taught by this school of morality, the Mysteries of Isis. Q. What does the word Isis signify? A. The word Isis is formed from the duplication of the root iss , it is; the word Jehovha is formed from the third person of the root hovah , I exist; hence they both express the source of being by its own essence. Heseri, or Osiris, is a reduplication of Isis. 1 The initiates regard the word Isis as a sacred and incom- municable word. 2 The triangle, which they call the geometrical God, was the emblem of Isis and is seen traced on the Isiac table. The initiated dead is made to say to the Justifier,—“My father is On, my mother is Isis. I understand, I see. I am one of the understanding ones.” Again,—“I am Tum (the hidden one), one being, I am one.” 3 1 [Of these etymologies, the first and third are nonsense and the second, though plausible, is disputed. A glance at the hieroglyphic forms, and the conventional transliterations ( ast and wsir ) of the names corrupted into Greek as Isis and Osiris will show ( a ) neither contains any duplication of symbols or phonemes although ( b ) both are written with the ‘throne’ glyph; there appears to be no etymological connection with the ordinary Egyptian words for existence.] 2 [This statement may be a garbling of actual Egyptian traditions concerning the ‘true names’ of gods (cf. the celebrated legend of Re and Isis); or it may simply have been mistranslated, the actual meaning being that the ‘mysteries of Isis’ as celebrated in the Græco-Roman world had a ‘secret name’ of the goddess which was only communicated to the initiates; the name ast or the Greek form Isis was widely known.] 3 [I have not managed to trace these quotes, not that I’ve tried very hard.

Will you describe the Mysteries of Antiquity? A. The Mysteries were divide d into two classes, the Lesser and the Greater. The aim of the Lesser was to instruct the ini- tiates in human science; the sacred doctrine was reserved for the Greater, and was called the Grand Manifestation of Light. All the Mysteries turned upon three principal points, morality, the exact sciences, and the sacred doctrine. The initiate passed from the first degree to the second, but only arrived at the second stage after a long preparation; the first stage consisted of three degrees and unfolded the Lesser Mysteries. The second stage of three degrees revealed the Greater Mysteries. The Les- ser Mysteries taught the doctrine of penalties and recompense; the Greater, that there was only one God. The general division included the preparation, voyages, symbols and autopsy. 1 The preparations were divided into two classes; the symbolic title of the first was Wisdom, and had morality for its object; the initiates of this degree were called Thalmedimites or disciples. The second step bore the symbolic title of Strength, and taught the arts and sciences; the initiates were called Heberimites or associates. The voyages and sy mbols were again divided into three classes; in the first, which was called the Obsequies, the initiates bore the name of Mourehimites ; in the second, which was called Vengeance (the passions), they were called Bherimites; in the third, which was called Enfranchisement, they were termed Nescherites . Autopsy was the grand complement of initiation, the crown of the edifice, the key of the vault.

When the initiate had arrived at the end of his trials, disengaged himself of terrestrial bonds, representing death to vice and his arrival at primitive purity, they invested him with a white tunic, placed a palm branch in his hand, and bound his forehead with an azure blue bandlet; they then made him undergo the seven steps of the sanctuary, when he beheld the Grand Hierophant seated upon a throne resplendent with light. His face was veiled, he had a luminous triangle upon his breast composed of seven precious stones, with a shining jod in the centre. The Hierophant raised a corner of his veil and pronounced three words. At the instant the light burst forth, thunder rolled, and the earth trembled under the feet of the initiate. But he, noble under all his trials, remained impassable and tranquil in the midst of the dangers which menaced him; upon which he heard voices, the source of which was con- cealed, one of which addressed him: “O! thou mortal! whose eager lips aspire to suck the teats of truth, learn that there exists but one sole Architect of this immense temple called the universe.

Write not upon snow.” 1 Q. What is symbolised by the ladder of seven steps? A. The seven degrees of the ancient initiatory rites and the trials of the seven Mythraic caverns or doors of various metals, which figure the seven planets; the Babylonian legend of Ishtar, Isis, or Ceres, relates under the legends of the sign of Virgo , that she visited her dead husband in the realms of departed souls, and during he r progress had to pass through seven gates; within the first the crown was taken from her head, in the second the earrings from her ears, in the third the gems from her hair, in the fourth the stones from her forehead, in the fifth the girdle form her waist, in the sixth the golden rings from her hands and feet, in the seventh the last garment from her body. Thus, divested of all emblems of rank, was taught the lesson that only goodness was accepted. 2 The same legends record under the sign of Aquarius, 3 that Isdurbad 1 [The various Mystery-Cults of the Græco-Roman world—there were many, of different origin, some older than others—did, for the most part, such a good job of keeping secret what went on in their assemblies that by the nineteenth century C .

Blame not, and condemn still less, the religion of others. 67. The S.A.O.T.U. only demands from thee the reckoning of thy own works, and does not make thee responsible for the errors or weaknesses of other men, thy equails, and like thyself, the object of predilection and divine love. 68. A Mason ought to respect all worships, tolerate all opinions, fraternise with all men, relieve all unfortunates, and the rule of his instincts should be good thoughts and to speak and do good."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 292 69. Labour to render men better, dissipate the darkness of jgnorance, generate all the virtues which contribute to the instruction or love of mankind. 70. Learn to love and succor one another and accomplish your sublime destiny; thou wilt become the cherished of heaven and the benedictions of thy brothers will rest upon thee, and thou wilt walk the earth as the benefactor of humanity. 71. Hate superstition; adore God, who in creating thee a free and intelligent being, capable of virtue, hath made thee the arbiter of thy own destiny. 72. Listen to the voice of religion which cries to thee,—All men are equal, all are members of the same family; be tolerant, just, and good, and thou wilt be happy. 73. Let all thy actions be directed to utility and goodness; judge of them beforehand; if any of thy meditated actions be of doubtful character, abstain thee. 74. Practice virtue, it is the charm of existence, it consists in mutual benefits. 75. Know that thy felicity is inseperable from that of thy fellow beings; do to them as them wouldst wish them to do unto thee; let thy devotion to humanity involve, if necessary, even the sacrifice of thy life. 76. The moral law is universal; let its sacred text be graven on the hearts of men; whoever transgresses it shall unfailingly be punished. 77. The just man. strong in hi s approving conscience, is beyond the reach of misfortune and persecution; his trust is in the justice of the Supreme Being. 78. The wicked undergo unceasing punishment; no Lethean waters can extinguish the fires of remorse. 79. Forget not that thy soul is immaterial, and cannot, therefore, perish, as does the body, which dissolves into its component elements; beware of staining it with vice. 80. Remember incessantly that thy felicity is of thy own creation; and that thy place is at the head of created beings. 81. Seek in the visible marvels of the universe, a knowledge of T.S.A.O.T.U. and His perfections; be always docile to the"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"GRAND BOOK OF MAXIMS 293 voice of nature, which is that of reason and conscience. 82. Practice virtue and flee vice; act so as to be always satis- fied with thvself. 83. Love thy fellows, be useful to them as far as lies in thy power; seek not thy own interest, but the well being of all. 84. The existence of God is a truth of sentiment and o( immediate evidence; it is the first and foundation of all axioms. 85. The most agreeable worship of T.S.A.O.T.U. is good morals and the practice of virtue. 86. By a sentiment of natural eq uity, when we attempt to judge others let us examine ourselves. 87. The more we need indulgence, so much the more is it necessary to spread over the failings of our fellows the benevol- ent veil which should divest the understanding of ingratitude and malignity. 88. Slander indicates either littleness of spirit or blackness of heart; it springs from jealousy, envy, avarice, or some such passions; it is a proof of ignorance or malice. Undesigned slander is folly; slander with refl ection shows blackness of heart; what the slanderer says he wish es; it is foolish or wicked. 89. If persecuted avenge not yourself; there exists but two kinds of enemies, the ignorant and the wicked: seek to ameliorate the one and instruct the other,—persuasion succeeds better than violence. 90. Our true enemies are within us: let us root out of the heart, ambition, avarice, and jealousy, and we shall re-establish that order and harmony which should reign in society; all men are brothers.. 91. Union, when it is perfect, satisfies all desires and simplifies the wants; it foresees the vows of imagination and sustains all good; it is fortune become constant. 92. Forget not that we owe constant assitance to the unfortunate; visit them in your leisure at their dwellings, where misery brings groans and tears; carry there the resources of you intelligence and the superfluities of your social condition; in the distribution of your benefits yo u will receive the most honour- able homage that man can have; in devoting yourself to bene-"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 294 ficience, you will follow the law,—all the law. 93. Conscience is the most precious gift which God has given to man; it instructs us in the vices which we ought to avoid, and the virtues which we ought to practice; it is a continual and severe judge, from whose arrests no mortal can exempt himself. 94. God made of the conscience a friend to whom flattery is a stranger; it adds to our expe rience, and we should always consult it before any action. 95. Sadden not the heart of a poor person who is already overcome with grief, and delay not relief to those who suffer. 96. Nothing is so painful as to request a service; nothing is so delightful as to anticipate one. 97. Friendship is usually but a vile commerce, in which each person hopes to draw usurious interest on his advances. 98. Humanity resembles a child which comes into the world during the night; by passing through darkness it arrives at light. 99. We cannot respect too much tht: innocency of a child; dost thou meditate some action for which thou ought to blush, then think of thy child in the cradle. 100. It is proper to love a friend for the pleasure of friendship, and not for the profit to be obtained by it. 101. If our only desire is to be happy, that is soon attained; but if we desire to be more happy than others, that is most diffi- cult, for we see others more happy than they really are. 102. If thou blushest at thy state it is pride; reflect that it is neither thy state or position which honours or degrades thee, but the way in which thou fillest it. 103. Great resources of spirit and heart are needed to love sincerity when it wounds, and to practice it when it offends; few people have sufficient firmness to speak the truth when they may suffer for it. 104. All people have ever considered truth as most sublime— it is the most simple and na tural virtue, and yet the most difficult. 105. Exact no other condition for admission amongst us than probity and knowledge; receive and instruct all honest men,"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"GRAND BOOK OF MAXIMS 295 whatever their belief, country, or laws—our dogmas are simply, God and virtue. 106. Purify thy heart; spread in the world the word of life; instruct the ignorant; relieve those who suffer; teach the profane brothers to hate vice, pride, and all evil passions, and to love virtue ardently. 107. Let thy voice resound in the defence of the innocent and unfortunate, against oppression, that it may carry consolation and peace to the hearts of thy fellows, and terror to the souls of the wicked. 108. Depraved affections are the beginnings of sorrow. 109. An evil disposition is the disease of the soul, but injustice and impiety are the death of it. 110. It is impossible that he can be free who is a slave to his passions. 111. It is better to live lying on the grass, confiding in divinity and yourself, than lie on a golden bed amid perturbation. 112. The theorems of philosophy are to be enjoyed as much as possible, as if they were ambr osia or nectar; for the pleasure arising from them is genuine, incorruptible, and divine. 113. The friendship of one wise man is better than that of every fool. 114. Fraundulent men, and such as are only seemingly good, do all things in words, and nothing in 115. It is the same thing to nourish a serpent and benefit a depraved man, for gratitude is found in neither. 116. He who 1oves the goods of the soul will love things still more divine; but he who loves the goods of its transient habi- tations will love things human. 117. Consider both the praise and reproach of foolish persons as ridiculous, and the whole life of an ignorant man as a disgrace. 118. It is even more wretched to be subservient to passions than to tyrants. 119. Be vigilant in regard to your intellectual part, for sleep in this has an affinity with real death. 120. Esteem those to be most eminently your friends who assist you with your soul rather than your body."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 296 121. Make trial of a man rather from his deeds than his dis- courses, for many live badly and speak well. 122. Do that which you consider to be worthy and honest, though you should gain no glory from it, for the multitude is a bad judge of worthy actions. 123. He is a wise man and beloved by divinity who labours for the good of his soul, as much as others labour for the welfare of the body. 124. The strength of the soul is temperance, for it is the light of one destitute of passions; but it is much better to die than darken the soul through the intemperance of the body. 125. It is impossible that the same person can be a lover of pleasure, a lover of the body, a lover of riches, and a lover of the divinity. 126. Clouds frequently obscure the sun, but the passions the reasoning powers. 127. The felicity of a man does not consist either in body or in riches, but in upright conduct and justice. 128. Garments that have been made clean and bright become soiled again by use; but the soul being once purified from ignorance remains splendid for ever. 129. When virtue is the object of emulation, vice must necessary perish. 130. Choose rather to leave your children well instructed than rich, for the hopes of the learned are better than the riches of the ignorant. 131. At every feast remember that there are two guests to be entertained—the body and the soul; and that what you give the body you presently lose, but what you give the soul remains for ever. 132. It is not useless to procure wealth, but to procure it by injustice is the most pernicious of all things. 133. The Divinity has no place upon earth more allied to His nature than a pure and holy soul. 134. The most complete injustice is to seem to be just without being so. 135. It is the province of a wise man to bear poverty with"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"GRAND BOOK OF MAXIMS 297 equanimity. 136. Those alone are dear to Divinity who are hostile to injustice. 137. The fear of death arises through ignorance of the soul. 138. It is equally dangerous to give a sword to a madman and power to a depraved one. 139. It is the same thing to moor a boat by an infirm anchor, and to place hope upon a depraved person. 140. It is not safe to despise those things of which we shall be in want after the dissolution of the body. 141. As the lesser mysteries are to be delivered before the greater, so must discipl ine precede philosophy. 142. The wise man whose estimation with men was but small while he was living, will be renowned when he is dead. 143. It is the same thing to drink a deadly poison from a golden cup, and follow the advice of an injudicious friend. 144. Forget not that error and ignorance are crimes, when they are the result of indifference for truth; tremble is a slothful ignorance has dishonoured thy life , or if vice has blemished thy heart and blighted thy days. 145. Forget not that all which thinks has intelligence, all which feels has sentiments, all which loves the right of being loved, all which suffers a title to pity; there is not a step lacking in the mystic ladder of creation; it rises by a graduated ascent from the brute to man. 146. Judge not lightly the actions of men; praise little and blame still less; it is for T.S. A.O.T.U. to sound the heart and appraise the work that He has made. 147. If vain curiosity brings thee amongst us, depart! 148. If worldly distinctions adhere to thee, go; they are not found here. 149. If thou art afraid to be enlightened upon thy faults, come not amongst us. 150. Reflect that it is necessary to cease to be man, in order to enter the road which conducts to the Sanctuary of Masonry; it is the shadow of Divinity, to approach thither it is necessary to raise thyself to God."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"L ECTURES OF A C HAPTER , S ENATE AND C OUNCIL 298 151. If sincere repentance gives not innocence, it bring pardon to the gravest faults. 152. Keep thy soul in such a state of purity that it may be worthy to appear at any time before T.S.A.O.T.U. 153. Fragile man, during life thou art the slave of necessity, and the plaything of events; but console thyself, for death awaits thee, and in its bosom is repose. 154. Man is born to suffer, it is the law of his being; His joys are a load to be paid with usury; Under this law of happiness all have birth. Whether he sleeps on purple or slumbers on sackcloth, He is destined to know misfortune. 155. There is no void in nature, everywhere it is peopled: there is no real death in nature, everything is living. 156. Death exists, not for the wise; it is but a phantom which the ignorance and weakness of the multitude hath made horrible; that which we call death is only a change of state. 157. There is no invisible world, but only different degrees of perfection in the bodily organs. The body is the gross represen- tation, and the temporary envelope of the soul, which can perceive by itself without the interventionof the bodily organs by means of its sensibility and lucidity, the things spiritual and corporeal wnich exist in the universe. 158. If T.S.A.O.T.U. has given thee a son be grateful unto Him, but tremble for the deposit which He hath confided to thy care; be unto such child the living image of divinity; cause him up to ten years of age to fear thee; up to twenty to love thee, so that even until death he may respect thee. Even up to ten years of age be his Master, to twenty years of age his father, until death his friend; strive to teach him good principles rather than fine manners, so that he may owe thee an enlightened and upright understanding, rather than a frivolous elegance; and make an honest man rather than an able one.
