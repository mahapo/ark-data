[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"F reemasonry is a subject that has attracted much discussion for centuries. Some have accused Masonry of fantastic crimes and misdeeds. However, instead of try- ing to understand \"the Brotherhood\" and criticizing it objectively, critics have been un- duly hostile to the organization. This book contains a true exposition of Masonry as a school of thought. The most im- portant unifying influence among Masons is their philosophy—which can be best de- scribed according to such terms as \"materialism\" and \"secular humanism.\" But, it is an errant philosophy based on false suppositions and flawed theories, as you will see in this book. In this book, the reader will also be presented with a summary of the history of the Masons’ struggle against theistic religions. Freemasons have played an important role in distancing Europe from religion, and in its place, founding of a new order based on the philosophies of materialism and secular humanism. The reader will also see how Masonry has been influential in the imposition of these dogmas—and a social order based on them—on non-Western civilizations. After reading this book, the reader will be able to consider many aspects, from schools of philosophy to newspaper headlines, rock songs to political ideologies, with a deeper understanding, and better discern the meaning and aims behind events and factors. ABOUT THE AUTHOR T he author, who writes under the pen-name Harun Yahya, was born in Ankara in 1956. He studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University, and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith- re- lated and scientific issues. His main focus has been the refutation of Darwinism and materialism, two modern myths presented under a scientific guise. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in helping many to return their faith in God, and, in many others, to gain a deeper insight into their faith. Harun Yahya's books ap- peal to all kinds of readers, regardless of their age, race, or nationality, for they focus on one objective: to broaden the readers’ perspective by encouraging them to think about a number of critical issues, such as the existence of God and His unity, and to display the decrepit foundations and perverted works of godless philosophies.

Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the au- thor has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evo- lutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism. His pen-name is made up of the names \"Harun\" (Aaron) and \"Yahya\" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the books is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scrip- ture) and the Prophet Muhammad, the last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and sunnah, the author makes it his purpose to disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the \"last word\", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfec- tion, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. All author' s works center around one goal: to convey the Qur' an' s message to people, en- courage them to think about basic faith-related issues (such as the existence of God, His unity and the Hereafter), and to expose the feeble foundations and perverted ideologies of godless systems. Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they are enjoyed by readers world- wide. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering their faith in God and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style gives these books a distinct touch which directly effects any one who reads or studies them. Immune to objections, these works are characterized by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is un- likely that those who read these books and give serious thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism or any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence since these books refuted such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Qur'an. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works. Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the \"eyes\" of the heart and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books which cre- ate confusion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts, as also verified from previous experi- ence. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success and impact of this service are manifest in r eaders' conviction. One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and all the ordeals the majority of people undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This state can only be ended with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of cre- ation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which leads people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. E"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role.

All the subjects that concern God's verses are ex- plained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader's mind. The sincere, plain and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily under- stand the books. This effective and lucid narrative makes it possible to r ead them in a single sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts recounted in these books and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. This book and all the other works by Harun Yahya can be read indi- vidually or discussed in a group. Those readers who are willing to profit from the books will find discussion very useful in that they will be able to r elate their own reflections and experiences to one another. In addition, it is a great service to the religion to contribute to the presentation and circulation of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of God. All the books of the author are extremely con- vincing, so, for those who want to communicate the religion to other peo- ple, one of the most effective methods is to encourage them to read these books. It is hoped that the reader will take time to look through the review of other books on the final pages of the book, and appreciate the rich source of material on faith-related issues, which are very useful and a pleasure to read.

Some have accused Masonry of fan- tastic crimes and misdeeds. Instead of trying to under- stand \"the Brotherhood,\" and criticizing it objectively, critics have been unduly hostile to the organization. For their part, Masons have deepened their traditional reticence in the face of these accusations, preferring to present themselves as an ordinary social club—which they are not. This book contains a correct exposition of Masonry as a school of thought. The most important unifying influence among Masons is their philosophy—which can be best described according to such terms as \"materialism\" and \"secular humanism.\" But, it is an errant philosophy based on false suppositions and flawed theories. This is the basic start- ing-point from which Masonry must be criticized. It is necessary to point out from the start that such criticism is im- portant, not only to inform non-Masons on the subject, but also to invite Masons themselves to see the truth. Of course, Masons, like everyone else, are free to choose for themselves, and can adopt whatever world- view they wish and to live in accordance with it. This is their natural right.

This book, in part, also deals with the history of Judaism and offers certain important criticisms. It must be pointed out that these have nothing to do with anti-Semitism or \"Judeo- Masonic\" conspiracy theories. Indeed, anti-Semitism is alien to a true Muslim. Jews are a people that at one time had been chosen by God and to whom He sent many prophets. Throughout history they suffered much cruelty, even being subjected to genocide, but they never abandoned their identity. In the Qur'an, God calls them, together with Christians, the Peo- ple of the Book, and enjoins Muslims to treat them kindly and justly. But, a necessary part of this justice is to criticize the errant beliefs and practices of some of them, to show them the path to true righteousness. But of course, their right to live according to what they believe in and desire is beyond question. Global Freemasonry sets out from this premise, and investigates criti- cally Masonry's roots, as well as its aims and activities.

In a period when Europe was expe- riencing great poverty and misery, the prosperity and wealth of the East, es- pecially of the Muslim in the Middle East, attracted the Europeans. This inclination took on a religious facade, and was ornamented with the sym- bols of Christianity, though, in actuality, the idea of the Crusades was born out of a desire for worldly gain. This was the reason for the sudden change among Christians of Europe from their former pacifist policies, in earlier pe- riods of their history, towards military aggression. The founder of the Crusades was Pope Urban II. He summoned the Council of Clermont, in 1095, in which the former pacifist doctrine of the Christians was abandoned. A holy war was called for, with the intent to wrest the holy lands from the hands of the Muslims. Following the coun- cil, a huge army of Crusaders was formed, composed both of professional DD FROM THE TEMPLARS TO ANCIENT EGYPT The roots of Masonry date back to the Crusades against Muslims initiated by Pope Urban II"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"soldiers, and tens of thousands of ordinary people. Historians believe Urban II's venture was prompted by his desire to thwart the candidacy of a rival to the papacy. Furthermore, while Euro- pean kings, princes, aristocrats and others greeted the pope's call with ex- citement, their intentions were basically mundane. As Donald Queller of The University of Illinois put it, \"the French knights wanted more land. Italian merchants hoped to expand trade in Middle Eastern ports... Large numbers of poor people joined the expeditions simply to escape the hard- ships of their normal lives.\" 1 Along the way, this greedy mass slaughtered many Muslims, and even Jews, in hopes of finding gold and jewels. The crusaders even cut open the stomachs of those they had killed to find gold and precious stones the victims may have swallowed before they died. So great was the material greed of the crusaders that they felt no qualms in sacking the Christian city of Constantinople (Istanbul) during the Fourth Crusade, when they stripped off the gold leaf from the Christian frescoes in the Hagia Sophia. After a long and difficult journey, and much plunder and slaughter of Muslims, this motley band called Crusaders reached Jerusalem in 1099. When the city fell after a siege of nearly five weeks, the Crusaders moved in. They carried out a level of savagery the like of which the world has sel- dom seen. All Muslims and Jews in the city were put to the sword. In the words of one historian, \"They killed all the Saracens and the Turks they found... whether male of female.\" 2 One of the Crusaders, Raymond of Aguiles, boasted of this violence: W onderful sights were to be seen. Some of our men (and this was more merci- ful) cut off the heads of their enemies; others shot them with arrows, so that they fell from the towers; others tortured them longer by casting them into flames.

Later, the crusaders initiated a struggle to maintain their position in the Middle East. In order to sustain the state they had founded, it was nec- essary to organize it. To this end, they established military orders, the alike of which had never existed before. Members of these orders came from Eu- r ope to Palestine, and lived in a type of monastery where they received military training to fight against Muslims. One of these orders, in particular, was different from the others. It un- derwent a transformation that would influence the course of history. This order was the Templars.

The founders of the order were two French knights, Hugh de Payens and Godfrey de St. Omer. At first there were 9 members, but the order steadily grew. The reason they named themselves after the temple of Solomon was because the place they had chosen as a base was the temple mount where this ruined temple had been located. This same location was where the Dome of the Rock (Qubbet as-Sakhrah) stood. The Templars called themselves \"poor soldiers,\" but within a short time they became very wealthy. Christian pilgrims, coming from Europe to Palestine, were under the complete control of this order, and by whose money they became very rich. In addition, for the first time they set up a cheque and credit system, similar to that of a bank. According to the British authors, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, they established a kind of Medieval capitalism, and led the way to modern banking through their interest-based transactions. 5 It was the Templars who were mainly responsible for the crusaders' at- GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DG The Crusaders put to sword all those living in the lands they conquered."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"tacks of and murder of Muslims. For this reason, the great Islamic comman- der Saladin, who defeated the crusaders' army in 1187, in the Battle of Hattin, and afterwards rescued Jerusalem, put the Templars to death for the mur- ders they had committed, even though he had otherwise pardoned a large number of Christians. Although they lost Jerusalem, and suffered heavy ca- sualties, the Templars continued to exist. And, despite the continual diminu- tion of the Christian presence in Palestine, they increased their power in Europe and, first in France, and then in other countries, became a state within a state. There is no doubt that their political power made the monarchs of Europe uneasy. But there was another aspect of the Templars that also made the clergy ill at ease: the order had gradually apostatized from the Christian faith, and while in Jerusalem, had adopted a number of strange mystical doctrines. There were also rumors that they were organizing strange rites to give form to these doctrines. Finally, in 1307, the French king Philip le Bel decided to arrest the members of the order. Some of them managed to escape but most of them were caught. Pope Clement V also joined the purge. Following a long pe- riod of interrogation and trial, many of the Templars admitted to heretical beliefs, that they had rejected the Christian faith and insulted Jesus in their masses. Finally, the leaders of the Templars, who were called \"grand mas- ters,\" beginning with the most important of them, Jacques de Molay, were executed in 1314 by order of the Church and the King. The majority of them were put into prison, and the order dispersed and officially disappeared. Some historians have a tendency to portray the trial of the Templars as a conspiracy on the part of the King of France, and depict the knights as innocent of the charges. But, this manner of interpretation fails in several aspects. Nesta H. Webster, the famous British historian with a great deal of knowledge on occult history, analyzes these aspects in her book, Secret So- cieties and Subversive Movements. According to Webster, the tendency to ab- solve the Templars of the heresies they confessed to during the trial period DH FROM THE TEMPLARS TO ANCIENT EGYPT"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"is unjustified. First, during the interrogations, despite the standard claim, not all the Templars were tortured; Moreover, do the confessions of the Knights appear to be the outcome of pure imagination such as men under the influence of torture might devise? It is cer- tainly difficult to believe that the accounts of the ceremony of initiation given in detail by men in different countries, all closely resembling each other, yet re- lated in different phraseology, could be pure inventions. Had the victims been driven to invent they would surely have contradicted each other, have cried out in their agony that all kinds of wild and fantastic rites had taken place in order to satisfy the demands of their interlocutors. But no, each appears to be describ- ing the same ceremony more or less completely, with characteristic touches that indicate the personality of the speaker, and in the main all the stories tally. 6 Anyhow, the trial of the Templars ended with the termination of the order. But, although the order \"officially\" ceased to exist, it did not actually disappear. During the sudden arrest in 1307, some Templars escaped, managing to cover their tracks.

There, they reorganized under the protection of the Scottish King, Robert the Bruce. Some time later, they found a convenient method of disguise by which to continue their clan- destine existence: they infiltrated the most important guild in the me- dieval British Isles—the wall builders' lodge, and eventually, they fully seized control of these lodges. 7 The wall-builders' lodge changed its name, at the beginning of the modern era, calling itself the \"Masonic lodge.\" The Scottish Rite is the oldest branch of Masonry, and dates back to the beginning of the fourteenth cen- tury, to those Templars who took refuge in Scotland.

This thesis is sup- ported by much historical evidence, and is accepted today by a large num- ber of Western historians, whether they are Freemasons or not. In our book, The New Masonic Order , we examined this evidence in detail. The thesis that traces the roots of Masonry to the Templars is often re- ferred to in magazines published by Masons for its own members. Freema- sons are very accepting of the idea. One such magazine is called Mimar Sinan (a publication of Turkish Freemasons), which describes the relationship be- tween the Order of the Templars and Freemasonry in these words: In 1312, when the French king, under pressure from the Church, closed the Order of Templars and gave their possessions to the Knights of St. John in Jerusalem, the activities of the Templars did not cease. The great majority of the Templars took refuge in Freemasonic lodges that were operating in Europe at that time. The leader of the Templars, Mabeignac, with a few other members, found refuge in Scotland under the guise of a wall builder under the name of Mac Benach. The Scottish King, Robert the Bruce, welcomed them and allowed them to exercise great influence over the Masonic lodges in Scotland. As a result, Scottish lodges gained great importance from the point of view of their craft and their ideas. T oday Freemasons use the name Mac Benach with respect. Scottish Masons, who inherited the Templars' heritage, re- turned it to France many years later and established there the basis of the rite known as the Scottish Rite.\" 8 Again, Mimar Sinan presents a lot of information about the relationship between the Templars and Freemasonry. In an article entitled, \"Templars and Freemasons,\" it states that \"the rituals of the initia- tion ceremony of the Order of Templars are similar to those of present-day Freemasonry.\" 9 According to DK GLOBAL FREEMASONRY The Warriors And The Bankers : A book about the Templars"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the same article, as in Masonry, the members of the Order of the Templars called each other \" brother .\" 10 T owards the end of the article, we read: The Order of the Templars and the Masonic organi- zation have influenced each other to a noticeable extent. Even the rituals of the corporations are so similar as to have been copied from the Templars. In this respect, Masons have to a great extent identi- fied themselves with the Templars and it can be said that what is viewed as original Masonic eso- terism (secrecy) is to an important extent an inher- itance from the Templars . To summarize, as we said in the title of this essay, we can say that the starting point of Freemasonry's royal art and initiatic-esoteric line be- longed to Templars and its end-point belonged to Freemasons. 11 Finally, we say, it is clear that the roots of Freemasonry stretch back to the Order of Templars, and that the Masons have adopted the philosophy of this order. Masons themselves accept this. But certainly, the important matter for our consideration is the nature of this philosophy. Why did the T emplars abandon Christianity and become a heretical order? What led them to this? Why did they undergo such a change in Jerusalem? Through the agency of Masonry, what has been the effect on the world of this phi- losophy adopted by the Templars?

In a publication of Turkish Masonry, the magazine Mimar Sinan , the Masonic ori- gins and the pagan elements of the chapel are described in these words: The most convincing proof of the unity of the Templars and the Masons in Scotland is the castle and chapel in the village of Roslin, 10 km. south of Edinburgh and 15 km. from the ancient Templar center at Balantrodoch. The Templars lived in this region and in this castle especially after 1312 under the protection of the Barons of St. Clair. ...The chapel was built between 1446-48 by Sir William St. Clair who was one of the most prominent nobles of the time in Scotland and even in Europe. Masons and Rosicrucians worked on the construction.

Apart from the fact that the chapel was constructed in a marked pagan style with Egyptian, Hebrew, Gothic, Norman, Celtic, Scandinavian, Templar and Masonic architectural elements, and that it contains very rich examples of stone work, one of the most interesting as- pects of it is that the tops of the columns are decorated with cactus and corn motifs, besides various other plants figures. ... There are so many pagan decorative elements inside the chapel that a priest, writing an account of the baptism he performed of the Baron of Rosslyn in 1589 complained, \"because the chapel is filled with pagan idols, there is no place appropriate to admin- ister the Sacrament.

At the root of this lies a secret that they discovered in the temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, whose ruins they had set out to investi- gate. The writers explain that the Templars used their purported role as protectors of Christian pilgrims visiting Palestine as a pretense, but that their real aim was quite different: ...There is no evidence that these founding Templars ever gave protection to pilgrims, but on the other hand we were soon to find that there is conclusive proof that they did conduct extensive excavations under the ruins of Herod's T emple... 12 The authors of The Hiram Key were not the only ones who found evi- dences of this. French historian Gaetan Delaforge makes this similar con- tention: The real task of the nine knights was to carry out research in the area in order to obtain certain relics and manuscripts which contain the essence of the secret traditions of Judaism and ancient Egypt. 13 At the end of the nineteenth century, Charles Wilson of the Royal Engineers, began conducting archeological research in Jerusalem. He arrived at the opinion that the Templars had gone to Jerusalem to study the ruins of the temple. Wilson found traces of digging and excavation under the foundations of the temple, and concluded that these were done by tools that belonged to the Templars.

In addition, many r esearchers are of the same opinion. There must have been something that led the Templars, despite the fact that they had previously been Christian and came from a Christian part of the world, to adopt a system of beliefs and a philosophy so completely different from that of Christianity, cele- brate heretical masses, and perform rituals of black magic. According to the common views of many researchers, this \"some- thing\" was the Kabbalah . The meaning of the word Kabbalah is \"oral tradition.\" Encyclopedias and dictionaries define it as an esoteric, mystical branch of Jewish religion. According to this definition, the Kabbalah investigates the hidden mean- ing of the Torah and other Jewish religious writings. But, when we exam- ine the matter more closely, we discover that the facts are quite something else. These facts lead us to the conclusion that the Kabbalah is a system rooted in pagan idolatry; that it existed before the Torah, and became widespread within Judaism after the Torah was revealed. This interesting fact about the Kabbalah, is explained by just as interest- ing a source. Murat Ozgen, a Turkish Freemason, maintains the following in his book, Masonluk Nedir ve Nasildir? (What is Freemasonry and What is it Like?): We don't know clearly where the Kabbalah came from or how it developed. It is the general name for a unique, metaphysically constituted, esoteric and mystical philosophy particularly connected with Jewish religion. It is ac- cepted as Jewish mysticism, but some of the elements it contains show that it was composed much earlier than the Torah. 15 The French historian, Gougenot des Mousseaux, explains that the Kabbalah is actually much older than Judaism. 16 EF FROM THE TEMPLARS TO ANCIENT EGYPT"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"EG GLOBAL FREEMASONRY Although the Kabbalah developed within Judaism, it depends on sources from outside of it.

For thousands of years, the Kabbalah has been one of the foundation-stones of every kind of magic ritual. It is believed that rabbis who study the Kabbalah possess great magical power. Also, many non-Jews have been influenced by the Kabbalah, and have tried to prac- tice magic by employing its doctrines. The esoteric tendencies that took hold in Europe during the late Middle Ages, especially as practiced by al- chemists, have their roots, to a great extent, in the Kabbalah. The strange thing is, that Judaism is a monotheistic religion, incepted with the revelation of the Torah to Moses (peace be upon him). But, within this religion is a system called the Kabbalah, that adopts the basic prac- tices of magic forbidden by the religion. This substantiates what we have presented above, and demonstrates that the Kabbalah is actually an ele- ment that has entered Judaism from the outside. But, what is the source of this element? The Jewish historian Fabre d'Olivet says that it came from Ancient Egypt. According to this writer, the roots of the Kabbalah stretch back to Ancient Egypt . The Kabbalah is a tradition learned by some of the leaders of the Israelites in Ancient Egypt, and passed down as a tradition by word of mouth from generation to generation. 19 For this reason, we must look to Ancient Egypt in order to find the basic origins of the Kabbalah-Templars-Freemasonry chain.

It was also one of the most oppressive. The magnif- icent monuments that still remain from Ancient Egypt—the pyramids, sphinxes and obelisks—were constructed by hundreds of thousands of slaves, worked to the point of death, under the whip and threat of starva- tion. The pharaohs, the absolute rulers of Egypt, wanted themselves to be r epresented as gods and to be worshipped by the people. One of our sources of knowledge about Ancient Egypt is their own inscriptions. These were discovered in the nineteenth century and, after intense labor, the Egyptian alphabet was deciphered, bringing to light much information about the country. But, because these inscriptions were written by official state historians, they are filled with biased accounts de- signed to praise the state. For us, of course, the best source of knowledge about this matter is the Qur'an. In the Qur'an, in the story of Moses, we are given important informa- tion about the Egyptian system. The verses reveal that there were two im- portant focal points of power in Egypt: pharaoh and his inner-council. This council tended to exercise an important influence over pharaoh; Pharaoh would often consult them and, from time to time, follow their suggestions. The verses quoted below show the influence that this council had on Pharaoh: Moses said, \"Pharaoh! I am truly a Messenger from the Lord of all the worlds, duty bound to say nothing about God except the truth. I have come to you with a Clear Sign from your Lord. So send the tribe of Israel away with me.\" He said, \"If you have come with a Clear Sign produce it if you are telling the truth.\" So he threw down his staff and there it was, unmistakably a snake.

If we look at the records of Egyptian history, we see that the two basic components of this council were the army and the priests. There is no need to explain the importance of the army; it constituted the basic military power of the regimes of the pharaohs. But, we should look more closely at the role of the priests. The priests of Ancient Egypt were a class referred to in the Qur'an as magicians. They represented the cult which supported the regime.

This class of priests was a closed order possessed (so they thought) of a special knowledge. Such orders are commonly known as esoteric orga- nizations. In a magazine called Mason Dergisi (Masonic Journal), a publi- cation distributed among Turkish Masons, the roots of Freemasonry are stated as going back to this kind of esoteric order, and special mention is made of the Ancient Egyptian priests: As thought develops in human beings, science advances and as science ad- vances, the number of secrets increases within the lore of an esoteric sys- GLOBAL FREEMASONRY FC The most important supporters of Pharaoh's regime in Ancient Egypt was the priestly class (magicians).

In this development, this esoteric enterprise , which began first in the East, in China and Tibet, and then spread to India, Mesopotamia and Egypt, formed the basis of a priestly knowledge that had been practiced for thou- sands of years and formed the basis of the power of the priests in Egypt . 20 How can there be a relationship between the esoteric philosophy of the priests of Ancient Egypt and present-day Freemasons? Ancient Egypt—a classic example in the Qur'an of a godless political system—dis- appeared thousands of years ago. Can it have any influence today? To find the answer to these questions, we must look at the Ancient Egyptian priests' beliefs with regards to the origin of the Universe and of life.

According to these authors, the most important idea that has transpired to modern Masonry, from Ancient Egypt, is that of a universe existing by and of itself, and evolving by chance. They explain this interesting notion in these words: The Egyptians believed that matter had always existed; to them it was il- logical to think of a god making something out of absolutely nothing. Their view was that the world began when order came out of chaos, and that ever since there has been a battle between the forces of organization and disorder ...This chaotic state was called Nun, and like the Sumerian ...description ..., all was a dark, sunless watery abyss with a power, a cre- ative force within it that commanded order to begin.

Ancient Egypt was governed by the pagan system of Pharaoh, and there we found an idea that forms the basis of the modern atheistic philoso- phy: that of a universe existing of its own accord, and evolving by chance. All this surely paints an interesting picture. Is it by chance that the philosophy of the priests of Ancient Egypt still thrives, and that there exist traces of a chain (Kabbalah-Templars-Masonry) that has been responsible for maintaining the supremacy of this philosophy to the present day? Is it possible Masons, who have made their mark on the world's his- tory since the eighteenth century, fomenting revolutions, promoting philosophies and political systems, can be the inheritors of the magicians of Ancient Egypt?

For this reason, when we examine these stories closely, we can extract a number of lessons from them. T T H H E E G G O O L L D D E E N N C C A A L L F F One of the important facts concerning the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, as related in the Qur'an, is that they rebelled against the reli- gion revealed to them by God in spite of the fact that God had rescued them through Moses from the tyranny of Pharaoh. The Israelites were not able to comprehend the monotheism that Moses communicated to them, but tended continually toward idolatry. The Qur'an describes this strange tendency here: We conveyed the tribe of Israel across the sea and they came upon some people who were devoting themselves to some idols which they had. They said, \"Moses, give us a god just as these people have gods.\" He said, \"You are indeed an ignorant people. What these people are doing is destined for destruction. What they are doing is purposeless.\" (Qur'an, 7: 138-139) Despite Moses' warnings, the Israelites continued in such perversion, and when Moses left them, to ascend alone to Mt. Sinai, it manifested it- FH THE INSIDE STORY ON THE KABBALAH The statue that the Jews worshipped when they departed from their true religion was, according to many re- searchers, was an Egyptian idol made of gold in the form of a calf."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"self fully. Taking advantage of Moses' absence, a man by the name of Samiri came forth. He fanned the sparks of the Israelites' inclination to- wards idolatry, and persuaded them to fabricate the statue of a calf and worship it. Moses returned to his people in anger and great sorrow. He said, \"My peo- ple, did not your Lord make you a handsome promise? Did the fulfilment of the contract seem too long to you or did you want to unleash your Lord's anger upon yourselves, so you broke your promise to me?\" They said, \"We did not break our promise to you of our own volition. But we were weighed down with the heavy loads of the people's jewelry and we threw them in, for that is what the Samaritan did.\" Then he produced a calf for them, a physical form which made a lowing sound. So they said, \"This is your god—and Moses's god as well, but he forgot.\" (Qur'an, 20: 86-88) Why was there such a persistent tendency among the Israelites to erect idols and worship them? What was the source of this inclination? Clearly, a society that had never before believed in idols would not suddenly adopt such inane behavior as to construct an idol and begin to worship it. Only those for whom idolatry was natural inclination could have believed in such nonsense. However, the Israelites were a people that had believed in one God since the days of their ancestor Abraham. The name \"Israelites\" or \"the Sons of Israel\" was given first to the sons of Jacob, Abraham's grandson, and afterwards to the whole Jewish people who derived from him. The Is- raelites had safeguarded the monotheistic faith that they had inherited from their ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, peace be upon them. To- gether with Joseph, peace be upon him, they went into Egypt and pre- served their monotheism for a long period of time, despite the fact that they had lived amidst Egyptian idolatry. It is clear from the stories related in the Qur'an that, when Moses came to them, the Israelites were a people that believed in one God.

An important evidence in support of this conclusion is that the golden calf the Israelites worshipped, while Moses was on Mt. Sinai, was actually a replica of the Egyptian idols Hathor and Aphis . In his book, T oo Long in the Sun, the Christian author Richard Rives writes: Hathor and Aphis, the cow and bull gods of Egypt, were representatives of sun worship.

The tendency of the Israelites to the paganism of Ancient Egypt, that we have here outlined, is important to understand and gives us some insight into the corruption of the text of the Torah and the origins of the Kabbalah.

The doctrine that was introduced into Judaism from Ancient Egypt was the Kabbalah. Like the system of the Egyptian priests, the Kabbalah was an esoteric system, and its basis was the practice of magic. Interest- ingly, the Kabbalah provides an account of creation quite different from that found in the Torah. It is a materialist account, based on the Ancient Egyptian idea of the eternal existence of matter. Murat Ozgen, a Turkish Freemason, has this to say on this topic: It is evident that the Kabbalah was composed many years before the Torah came into existence. The most important section of the Kabbalah is a theory about the formation of the universe. This theory is very different from the story of creation accepted by theist religions. According to the Kabbalah, at the beginning of creation, things called Sefiroth , meaning \"circles\" or \"orbits,\" with both material and spiritual characteristics came into being. The total FL A sefiroth is one of the most blatant expressions of the pagan teachings of the Kab- balah. The figure composed of circles on the Kabbalistic engraving on the right is a sefiroth .

They took on the magic rituals of other pagan peoples, and thus, the Kabbalah became a mystical doctrine within Judaism, but contrary to the Torah. In her book entitled Secret Societies and Subversive Movements , the English writer Nesta H.

At the same time the speculative side of the Jewish Cabala borrowed from the philos- ophy of the Persian Magi, of the Neo-Platonists, and of the Neo-Pythagoreans. There is, then, some justification for the anti-Cabalists' contention that what we know to-day as the Cabala is not of purely Jewish origin. 25 There is a verse in the Qur'an that refers to this topic. God says that the Israelites learned satanic sorcery rituals from sources outside their own religion: They follow what the satans recited in the reign of Solomon. Solomon did not become unbeliever, but the satans did, teaching people sorcery and what had been sent down to Harut and Marut, the two angels in Babylon, who taught no one without first saying to him, \"We are merely a trial and temptation, so do not become unbeliever.\" People learned from them how to separate a man and his wife but they cannot harm anyone by it, except with God's permission. They have learned what will harm them and will not benefit them. They know that any who deal in it will have no share in the hereafter. What an evil thing they have sold themselves for if they only knew! (Qur'an, 2: 102) This verse maintains that certain Jews, although they knew that they would lose out in the hereafter, learned and adopted the practices of magic. Thus, they strayed away from the Law that God had sent them and, having sold their own souls, fell into paganism (magic doctrines). \"They have sold themselves\" for an evil thing, in other words, they aban- doned their faith. The facts related in this verse demonstrate the main features of an im- GD THE INSIDE STORY ON THE KABBALAH"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"portant conflict in Jewish history. This struggle was, on the one hand, be- tween the prophets that God sent to the Jews and those believing Jews who obeyed them, and on the other hand, those perverse Jews who re- belled against God's commandments, imitated the pagan culture of the peoples around them, and followed their cultural practices rather than the Law of God.

In the book of Nehemiah, a kind of history book within the Old Testament, the Jews confess their sins and repent: Then those of Israelite lineage separated themselves from all foreigners; and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God [for one-fourth] of the day; and [for another] fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God. Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Sheba- niah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, [and] Chenani stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the LORD their God. ...[They said:] \" ...they [our fathers] were disobedient and rebelled against Y ou, cast Your law behind their backs and killed Your prophets, who testi- fied against them to turn them to Yourself; And they worked great provo- cations. Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who oppressed them; And in the time of their trouble, when they cried to You, Y ou heard from heaven; And according to Your abundant mercies You gave them deliverers who saved them from the hand of their enemies.But after they had rest, They again did evil before You.

Yet they acted proudly, and did not heed Your commandments, but sinned against Your judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them. And they shrugged their shoulders, stiff- ened their necks, and would not hear. ...Nevertheless in Your great mercy You did not utterly consume them nor forsake them; For You [are] God, gracious and merciful. Now therefore, our God, The great, the mighty, and awesome God, ...You [are] just in all that has befallen us; For You have dealt faithfully, but we have done wickedly. Neither our kings nor our princes, our priests nor our fa- thers, have kept Your law, nor heeded Your commandments and Your tes- timonies, with which You testified against them. For they have not served Y ou in their kingdom, or in the many good [things] that You gave them, or in the large and rich land which You set before them; Nor did they turn from their wicked works.\" (Nehemiah 9: 2-4, 26-29, 31-35) This passage expresses the desire that a number of Jews had in re- turning to their faith in God, but in the course of Jewish history a different segment gradually gained strength, and came to dominate the Jews and later thoroughly altered the religion itself. For this reason, in the Torah and the other books of the Old Testament, there are elements that derive from heretical pagan doctrines, as well as those mentioned above which urge a r eturn to the true religion. For example: • In the first book of the Torah, it is said that God created the entire universe in six days from nothing. This is correct and derives from the original revelation. But, then it maintains that God rested on the seventh day, though it is a completely fabricated assertion. It is a perverse idea de- rived from paganism which attributes human qualities to God. In a verse of the Qur'an, God says: We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six days, nor GF THE INSIDE STORY ON THE KABBALAH"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"did any sense of weariness touch Us. (Qur'an, 50: 38) • In other parts of the Torah, there is a style of writing that is not re- spectful of the honor of God, especially in those places where human weakness is falsely attributed to Him. (God is surely beyond that) These anthropomorphisms are made to resemble the human weaknesses that pagans applied to their own fictitious gods. •O ne such blasphemous assertion is another that claims that Jacob, ancestor of the Israelites, wrestled with God, and won. This is clearly a story invented to confer the Israelites with racial superiority, in emulation of the racial feelings widespread among pagan peoples. (or, in the words of the Qur'an: \"fanatical rage\") • There is a tendency in the Old Testament to present God as a na- tional deity—that He is God of the Isrealites only. However, God is the Lord and God of the universe and of all human beings. This notion of na- tional religion, in the Old Testament, corresponds to tendencies of pagan- ism, in which every tribe worships its own god. • In some books of the Old Testament (for example, Joshua) com- mandments are given to commit horrible violence against non-Jewish peoples. Mass murder is commanded, with no regard for women, children or the elderly. This merciless savagery is totally against God's justice, and r ecalls the barbarism of pagan cultures, who worshipped a mythical god of war. These pagan ideas that were introduced into the Torah must have an origin. There must have been Jews who adopted, honored and cherished a tradition foreign to the Torah, and changed the latter by adding into it ideas derived from the tradition they espoused. The origin of this tradition stretches back to the priests of Ancient Egypt (the magicians of Pharaoh's r egime). It is, in fact, the Kabbalah which was passed on from there by a number of Jews. The Kabbalah assumed a form that enabled Ancient Egypt- ian and other pagan doctrines to insinuate themselves into Judaism and de- GLOBAL FREEMASONRY GG"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"velop within it. Kabbalists, of course, assert that the Kabbalah simply ex- plains in more detail the hidden secrets of the Torah, but, in reality, as Jewish historian of the Kabbalah, Theodore Reinach, says, the Kabbalah is \" a subtle poison which enters into the veins of Judaism and wholly infests it. \" 26 It is possible, then, to find in the Kabbalah clear traces of the materi- alist ideology of the Ancient Egyptians. T T H H E E K K A A B B B B A A L L A A H H – – A A D D O O C C T T R R I I N N E E O O P P P P O O S S E E D D T T O O C C R R E E A A T T I I O O N N I I S S M M God reveals in the Qur'an that the Torah is a divine book that was sent as a light to humanity: We sent down the Torah containing guidance and light, and the Prophets who had submitted themselves gave judgment by it for the Jews—as did their scholars and their rabbis—by what they had been allowed to pre- serve of God's Book to which they were witnesses...(Qur'an, 5: 44) Therefore, the Torah, like the Qur'an, is a book that contains knowl- edge and commands related to such topics as the existence of God, His unity, His qualities, the creation of human beings and other creatures, the purpose of human creation, and God's moral laws for humanity. (But, this original Torah is not extant today. What we possess today is an \"altered\" version of the Torah, corrupted by human hands.) There is an important point that both the true Torah and the Qur'an share in common: God is recognized as Creator. God is absolute, and has existed since the beginning of time. Everything other than God is His cre- ation, created by Him from nothing. He has created and formed the whole universe, the heavenly bodies, lifeless matter, human beings and all living things. God is One; He exists alone. While this is the truth, there is a quite different interpretation found in the Kabbalah, that \"subtle poison which enters into the veins of Judaism and wholly infests it.\" Its doctrine of God is totally opposed to the \"fact of GH THE INSIDE STORY ON THE KABBALAH"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"creation,\" found in the real Torah and the Qur'an. In one of his works on the Kabbalah, the American researcher, Lance S. Owens, presents his view on the possible origins of this doctrine: Kabbalistic experience engendered several perceptions about the Divine, GLOBAL FREEMASONRY GI The Kabbalah's teaching about the origins of the universe and living things is a story replete with myths totally contrary to the facts of creation revealed in holy books."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"many of which departured from the orthodox view. The most central tenet of Israel's faith had been the proclamation that \"our God is One.\" But Kabbalah asserted that while God exists in highest form as a totally ineffable unity— called by Kabbalah Ein Sof , the infinite—this unknowable singularity had necessarily emanated into a great number of Divine forms: a plurality of Gods. These the Kabbalist called Sefiroth , the vessels or faces of God. The manner by which God descended from incomprehensible unity into plural- ity was a mystery to which Kabbalists devoted a great deal of meditation and speculation. Obviously, this multifaceted God image admits to accusa- tions of being polytheistic, a charge which was vehemently, if never entirely successfully, rebutted by the Kabbalists. Not only was the Divine plural in Kabbalistic theosophy, but in its first sub- tle emanation from unknowable unity God had taken on a dual form as Male and Female; a supernal Father and Mother, Hokhmah and Binah, were God's first emanated forms. Kabbalists used frankly sexual metaphors to explain how the creative intercourse of Hokhmah and Binah generated further cre- ation... 27 An interesting feature of this mystical theology is that, according to it, human beings are not created, but are in some way divine. Owens de- scribes this myth: The complex Divine image ...was also visualized by Kabbalah as having a unitary, anthropomorphic form. God was, by one Kabbalistic recension, Adam Kadmon: the first primordial or archetypal Man. Man shared with God both an intrinsic, uncreated divine spark and a complex, organic form . This strange equation of Adam as God was supported by a Kabbalistic ci- pher: the numerical value in Hebrew of the names Adam and Jehovah (the T etragrammaton, Y od he vav he ) was both 45. Thus in Kabbalistic exegesis Jehovah equaled Adam : Adam was God. With this affirmation went the as- GJ THE INSIDE STORY ON THE KABBALAH"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"sertion that all humankind in highest realization was like God. 28 This theology comprises of a mythology of paganism, and formed the basis of the degeneration of Judaism. Jewish Kabbalists breached the limits of common sense to such an extent that they even tried to make human beings into gods. In addition, according to this theology, not only was humanity divine, but it consisted only of Jews; other races were not considered human. As a result, within Judaism, which was originally founded on the basis of service and obedience to God, this corrupt doc- trine began to develop, whose intent was to satiate Jewish arrogance. In spite of its contrary nature to the Torah, the Kabbalah was introduced into Judaism. Eventually though, it began to corrupt the Torah itself. Another interesting point about the corrupt doctrines of the Kab- balah is its similarity to the pagan ideas of Ancient Egypt. As we have dis- cussed in earlier pages, the Ancient Egyptians believed that matter had always existed; in other words, they rejected the idea that matter was cre- ated from nothing. The Kabbalah asserts the same thing in relation to human beings; it claims that human beings were not created, and that they are responsible for regulating their own existence. To state it in modern terms: the Ancient Egyptians were material- ists, and, essentially, the doctrine of the Kabbalah can be called secular humanism . It is interesting to note that these two concepts—materialism and sec- ular humanism—describe the ideology that has dominated the world over the last two centuries. It is tempting to ask if there are forces who have carried the doctrines of Ancient Egypt and the Kabbalah from the midst of ancient history to the present day.

We said that many researchers had reached the opinion that this secret was related to the Kabbalah. For example, in his book Histoire de la Magie (The History of Magic) the French writer, Eliphas Lévi, presents detailed evidence that the Templars were initiated into the mysterious doctrines of the Kabbalah, that is, they were secretly trained in this doctrine. 29 There- fore, a doctrine with its roots in Ancient Egypt was transmitted to the Tem- plars through the Kabbalah. In Foucault's Pendulum, the famous Italian novelist, Umberto Eco, re- lates these facts in the course of the plot. Throughout the novel, he relates, through the mouths of its protagonists, that the Templars were influenced by the Kabbalah and that the Kabbalists possessed a secret that could be traced back to the Ancient Egyptian pharaohs. According to Eco, some prominent Jews learned certain secrets taken from the Ancient Egyptians, and later inserted these into the first five books of the Old Testament (Pen- tateuch). But, this secret, which was transmitted secretly, could be under- stood only by the Kabbalists. (The Zohar, written later in Spain, and forming the fundamental book of the Kabbalah, deals with the secrets of these five books) After stating that the Kabbalists read this Ancient Egypt- ian secret also in the geometric measurements of the temple of Solomon, Eco writes that the Templars learned it from the Kabbalist rabbis in Jerusalem: The secret— what the Temple already said in full—is suspected only by a small group of rabbis who remained in Palestine... And from them the T emplars learn it . 30 When the Templars adopted this ancient Egyptian-Kabbalist doc- trine, naturally, they came into conflict with the Christian establishment that dominated Europe. This was a conflict they shared with another im- portant force—the Jews. After the Templars were arrested, by joint order of the king of France and the Pope in 1307, the order went underground, GL THE INSIDE STORY ON THE KABBALAH"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"but its influence continued, and in a more radical and determined way. As we said earlier, a significant number of Templars escaped arrest and appealed to the king of Scotland, the only European kingdom at that time that had not accepted the authority of the Pope. In Scotland, they in- filtrated the wall-builders' guild and, in time, took it over. The guilds adopted the traditions of the Templars, and thus, the Masonic seed was planted in Scotland. Still, to this day, the mainline of Masonry is the \"An- cient and Accepted Scottish Rite.\" As we investigated in detail in The New Masonic Order, from the be- ginnings of the fourteenth century it is possible to detect traces of the Tem- plars—and some Jews associated with them—at various stages of European history. Without going into detail, here are some of the headings under which we examined this topic: • In Provence, in France, there was an important Templar refuge. During the arrests, very many hid here. Another important feature of the area is that it is the most well known center of Kabbalism in Europe. Provence is the place where the oral tradition of the Kabbalah was made into a book. • The Peasants Revolt in England, in 1381, was, according to some historians, fanned to flame by a secret organization. Those experts who study the history of Masonry agree that this secret organization was the T emplars. It was more than a mere civil uprising, it was a planned assault on the Catholic Church. 31 • Half a century after this revolt, a clergyman in Bohemia by the name of John Huss started an uprising in opposition to the Catholic Church. Behind the scenes of this uprising were again the Templars. Moreover, Huss was very interested in the Kabbalah. Avigdor B en Isaac Kara was one of the most important names that he was influenced by in the development of his doctrines. Kara was a rabbi of the Jewish commu- nity in Prague and a Kabbalist. 32 Examples such as these are signs that the alliance between the Tem- GLOBAL FREEMASONRY HC"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"plars and the Kabbalists was directed at a change in the social order of Eu- r ope. This change involved an alteration in the basic Christian culture of Europe, and its replacement by a culture based on pagan doctrines, like the Kabbalah. And, after this cultural change, political changes would fol- low. The French and Italian revolutions, for example... In the coming sections, we will look at some important turning- points in the history of Europe. At every stage the fact that will confront us is that there existed a force that wanted to alienate Europe from its Christ- ian heritage, replace it with a secular ideology and, with this program in mind, to destroy its religious institutions. This force attempted to cause Europe to accept a doctrine that had been handed down from Ancient Egypt through the Kabbalah. As we pointed out earlier, at the basis of this doctrine were two important concepts: humanism and materialism. First, let us look at humanism. A model of Solomon's Temple. The Templars and Masons, because of their su- perstitious beliefs concerning Solomon, believe that there is a \"secret\" in this temple passed down from ancient pagan civilizations. It is for this reason that Masonic literature places so much emphasis on the temple of Solomon.

It brings to mind notions such as love of hu- manity, peace and brotherhood. But, the philosophical meaning of humanism is much more significant: hu- manism is a way of thinking that posits the concept of humanity as its focus and only goal. In other words, it calls human beings to turn away from God their Creator, and concern themselves with their own existence and identity. A common dictionary defines humanism as: \"a system of thought that is based on the values, characteristics, and behavior that are believed to be best in human beings, rather than on any supernatural au- thority.\" 33 The clearest definition of humanism, however, has been put forward by those who espoused it. One of the most prominent modern spokesmen for humanism is Corliss Lamont. In his book The Philosophy of Humanism, the author writes: 5[ 5["},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"HF HUMANISM REVISITED [In sum] humanism believes that nature ... constitutes the sum total of reality, that matter-energy and not mind is the foun- dation stuff of the universe and that su- pernatural entities simply do not exist. This nonreality of the supernatural means, on the human level, that men do not possess supernatural and immortal souls; and, on the level of the universe as a whole, that our cosmos does not pos- sess a supernatural and eternal God. 34 As we can see, humanism is almost identical to atheism, and this fact is freely admitted by humanists. There were two important manifestos published by hu- manists in the last century. The first was published in 1933, and was signed by some important individuals of that time. Forty years later, in 1973, a second humanist manifesto was published which confirmed the first, but contained some additions relative to some developments that had occurred in the meantime. Thousands of thinkers, scientists, writers and members of the media signed the second manifesto, which is sup- ported by the still very active American Humanist Association. When we examine the manifestos, we find one basic foundation in each of them: the atheist dogma that the universe and human beings were not created but exist independently, that human beings are not responsi- ble to any other authority besides themselves, and that belief in God has r etarded the development of individuals and societies. For example, the first six articles of the first Humanist Manifesto are as follows: First: Religious humanists regard the universe as self-existing and not created. Second: Humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has T oday, humanism has become another name for atheism.

Third: Holding an organic view of life, humanists find that the traditional dualism of mind and body must be rejected. Fourth: Humanism recognizes that man's religious culture and civilization, as clearly depicted by anthropology and history, are the product of a gradual development due to his interaction with his natural environment and with his social heritage. The individual born into a particular culture is largely molded by that culture. Fifth: Humanism asserts that the nature of the universe depicted by modern science makes unacceptable any supernatural or cosmic guarantees of human values... Sixth: We are convinced that the time has passed for theism, deism, mod- ernism, and the several varieties of \"new thought.\" 35 In the above articles, we see the expression of a common philosophy that manifests itself under such names as materialism, Darwinism, athe- ism and agnosticism. In the first article, the materialist dogma of the eter- nal existence of the universe is put forward. The second article states, as the theory of evolution does, that human beings were not created. The third article denies the existence of the human soul claiming that human beings are composed of matter. The fourth article proposes a \"cultural evo- lution\" and denies the existence of a divinely ordained human nature (a special human nature given in creation). The fifth article rejects God's sov- ereignty over the universe and humanity, and the sixth states that it is time to reject \"theism,\" that is belief in God. It will be noticed that these claims are stereotypical ideas, typical of those circles that are hostile to true religion. The reason for this is that hu- manism is the main foundation of anti-religious sentiment. This is because humanism is an expression of \"man's reckoning that he will be left to go on unchecked,\" which has been the primary basis, throughout history, for the denial of God. In one verse of the Qur'an, God says: GLOBAL FREEMASONRY HG"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Does man reckon he will be left to go on unchecked? W as he not a drop of ejaculated sperm, then a blood-clot which He created and shaped, making from it both sexes, male and female? Is He who does this not able to bring the dead to life? (Qur'an, 75: 36-40) God says that people are not to be \"left to go on unchecked,\" and re- minds them immediately afterwards that they are His creation. This is be- cause, when a person realizes that he is a creation of God, he understands that he is not \"unchecked\" but responsible before God. For this reason, the claim that human beings are not created has be- come the basic doctrine of humanist philosophy. The first two articles of the first Humanist Manifesto give an expression to this doctrine. More- over, humanists maintain that science supports these claims. However, they are wrong. Since the first Humanist Manifesto was published, the two premises that humanists have presented as scientific facts—the idea that the universe is eternal and the theory of evolution— have collapsed: 1. The idea that the universe is eternal was invalidated by a series of astronomical discoveries made when the first Humanist Manifesto was being written. Discoveries such as the fact that the universe is ex- panding, of cosmic background radiation and the calculation of the ratio of hydrogen to helium, have shown that the universe had a beginning, and that it came to be from nothing some 15-17 billion years ago in a giant explosion called the \"Big Bang.\" Although those who espouse the human- ist and materialist philosophy were unwilling to accept the Big Bang the- ory, they were eventually won over. As a result of the scientific evidence that has come to light, the scientific community has finally accepted the Big Bang theory, that is, that the universe had a beginning, and therefore humanists have no argument. Thus the atheist thinker Anthony Flew was forced to confess: HH HUMANISM REVISITED"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"...I will therefore begin by confessing that the Stratonician atheist has to be embarrassed by the contemporary cosmological consensus. For it seems that the cosmologists are providing a scientific proof of what St. Thomas con- tended could not be proved philosophically; namely, that the universe had a beginning... 36 2. The theory of evolution, the most important scientific justifica- tion behind the first Humanist Manifesto, started to lose ground in the decades after it was written. It is known today that the scenario proposed for the origin of life by atheist (and no doubt humanist) evolutionists, such as A. I. Oparin and J. B. S. Haldane in the 1930's, has no scientific validity; living things cannot be generated spontaneously from non-living matter as proposed by this scenario. The fossil record demonstrates that living things did not develop through a process of small cumulative changes, but appeared abruptly with their distinct characteristics, and this fact has been accepted by evolutionist paleontologists themselves since the 1970's. Modern biology has demonstrated that living things are not the result of chance and natural laws, but that there are in each organism complex sys- tems indicating an intelligent design that is evidence for creation. (For de- tails refer to Harun Yahya, Darwinism Refuted: How the Theory of Evolution Breaks Down in the Light of Modern Science ) Moreover, the erroneous claim that religious belief was the factor that prevented humanity from progressing and drew it into conflict has been disproved by historical experience. Humanists have claimed that the re- moval of religious belief would make people happy and at ease, however, the opposite has proved to be the case. Six years after the first Humanist Manifesto was published, the Second World War broke out, a record of the calamity brought upon the world by the secular fascist ideology.

A total of 120 million people were killed by communist regimes or organizations. It is also evident that the Western brand of humanism (capitalist systems) has not succeeded in bringing peace and happiness to their own societies or to other areas of the world. The collapse of humanism's argument on religion has also been man- ifested in the field of psychology. The Freudian myth, a corner-stone of the atheist dogma since early twentieth century, has been invalidated by em- pirical data. Patrick Glynn, of the George Washington University, explains this fact in his book titled God: The Evidence, The Reconciliation of Faith and Reason in a Postsecular World : The last quarter of the twentieth century has not been kind to the psychoan- alytic vision. Most significant has been the exposure of Freud's views of reli- gion (not to mention a host of other matters) as entirely fallacious. Ironically enough, scientific research in psychology over the past twenty-five years has demonstrated that, far from being a neurosis or source of neuroses as Freud and his disciples claimed, religious belief is one of the most consistent corre- lates of overall mental health and happiness. Study after study has shown a powerful relationship between religious belief and practice, on the one hand, and healthy behaviors with regard to such problems as suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, divorce, depression, even, perhaps surprisingly, levels of sexual satisfaction in marriage, on the other hand. 37 In short, the supposed scientific justifica- tion behind humanism has been proven invalid and its promises vain. Nevertheless, humanists have not abandoned their philosophy, but rather, in fact, have tried to spread it through- out the world through methods of mass propa- ganda. Especially in the post-war period there HJ HUMANISM REVISITED"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"has been intense humanist propaganda in the fields of science, philosophy, music, literature, art and cinema.

This is a good indication of the sentimentality with which humanism, lacking any scientific or rational foundation, is im- posed on the masses. Humanism can produce no rational objection to re- ligion or the truths it teaches, but attempts to employ suggestive methods such as these. When the promises of the 1933 I. Humanist Manifesto proved vain, forty years passed after which humanists presented a second draft. At the beginning of the text was an attempt to explain why the first promises had come to nothing. Despite the fact that this explanation was extremely weak, it demonstrated the enduring attachment of humanists to their atheist philosophy. The most obvious characteristic of the manifesto was its preserva- tion of the anti-religious line of the 1933 manifesto: As in 1933, humanists still believe that traditional theism, especially faith in the prayer-hearing God, assumed to live and care for persons, to hear and understand their prayers, and to be able to do something about them, is an unproved and outmoded faith... We believe ...that traditional dogmatic or authoritarian religions that place revelation, God, ritual, or creed above human needs and experience do a disservice to the human species... As nontheists, we begin with humans not God, nature not deity. 38 This is a very superficial explanation.

The predisposition must be sincerity and the avoidance of prejudice.

However, the efforts of humanists to describe faith in God and monotheistic religions as groundless and outmoded creeds is actually not a new undertaking; it is the emulation of a claim that has been made for thousands of years by those who reject God.

We have also seen that its foundation rests upon a perverse way of understanding that regards human beings as uncreated though divine creatures that have existed for eternity. Humanism entered Europe from this source. Christian belief was based on the existence of God, and the belief that human beings were His dependent servants created by Him. But, with the spread of the Templar tradition throughout Europe, the Kabbalah began to attract a number of philosophers. So, in the fifteenth century, a current of humanism began that left an indelible mark on the European world of ideas. This connection between humanism and the Kabbalah has been em- phasized in several sources. One of these sources is the book of the famous author Malachi Martin entitled The Keys of This Blood. Martin is professor of history at the Vatican's Pontifical Bible Institute. He says that the influ- ence of the Kabbalah can be clearly observed among the humanists: In this unaccustomed climate of uncertainty and challenge that came to mark early-Renaissance Italy, there arose a network of Humanist associa- tions with aspirations to escape the overall control of that established order. Given aspirations like that, these associations had to exist in the protection of secrecy, at least at their beginnings. But aside from secrecy, these humanist groups were marked by two other main characteristics. The first was that they were in revolt against the traditional interpretation of the Bible as maintained by the ecclesiastical and civil authorities, and against GLOBAL FREEMASONRY IE"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"the philosophical and theological underpin- nings provided by the Church for civil and political life... Not surprisingly given such an animus, these associations had their own conception of the original message of the Bible and of God's r evelation. They latched onto what they con- sidered to be an ultrasecret body of knowl- edge, a gnosis , which they based in part on cultic and occultist strains deriving from North Africa—notably, Egypt—and, in part, on the classical Jewish Kabbala.... Italian humanists bowdlerized the idea of Kabbala almost beyond recognition. They re- constructed the concept of gnosis , and trans- ferred it to a thoroughly this-wordly plane. The special gnosis they sought was a secret knowledge of how to master the blind forces of nature for a sociopolitical purpose .39 In short, the humanist societies formed in that period wanted to re- place the Catholic culture of Europe with a new culture that had its roots in the Kabbalah. They aimed to create a sociopolitical change to bring this about. It is interesting that, besides the Kabbalah, at the source of this new culture were the doctrines of Ancient Egypt. Prof. Martin writes: Initiates of those early humanist associations were devotees of the Great Force—the Great Architect of the Cosmos—which they represented under the form of the Sacred Tetragrammaton, YHWH ....[humanists] borrowed other symbols—the Pyramid and the All Seeing Eye—mainly from Egyptian sources. 40 It is quite interesting that humanists make use of the concept of \"the Great Architect of the Universe,\" a term still used by Masons today. This IF HUMANISM REVISITED As Vatican University historian Malachi Martin has shown, there is a close relationship be- tween the rise of humanism in Europe and the Kabbalah...."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"indicates that there must be a relationship between humanists and Ma- sons. Prof. Martin writes: In other northern climes, meanwhile, a far more important union took place, with the humanists. A union that no one could have expected. In the 1300s, during the time that the cabalist-humanist associations were be- ginning to find their bearings, there already existed—particularly in Eng- land, Scotland and France—medieval guilds of men ... No one alive in the 1300s could have predicted a merger of minds between freemason guilds and the Italian humanists.... The new Masonry shifted away from all allegiance to Roman ecclesiastical Christianity. And again, as for the Italian occultist humanists, the secrecy guaranteed by the tradition of the Lodge was essential in the circumstances. The two groups had more in common than secrecy, however. From the writ- ings and records of speculative Masonry, it is clear that the central religious tenet became a belief in the Great Architect of the Universe—a figure famil- iar by now from the influence of Italian humanists...The Great Architect was immanent to and essentially a part of the material cosmos, a product of the \"enlightened\" mind. There was no conceptual basis by which such a belief could be reconciled with Christianity. For precluded were all such ideas as sin, Hell for punish- ment and Heaven for reward, and eternally perpetual Sacrifice of the Mass, saints and angels, priest and pope. 41 In short, in Europe, in the fourteenth century, a humanist and Masonic organization was born that had its roots in the Kabbalah. And, this organiza- tion did not regard God as the Jews, Christians and Muslims did: the Creator and Ruler of the whole universe and the only Lord and God of humanity. In- stead, they used a different concept, such as the \"Great Architect of the Uni- verse,\" which they perceived as being \"part of the material universe.\" In other words, this secret organization, that appeared in Europe in the fourteenth century, rejected God, but, under the concept of \"the Great GLOBAL FREEMASONRY IG"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Architect of the Universe,\" accepted the material universe as a divinity. For a clearer definition of this corrupt belief, we can jump forward to the twentieth century and look at Masonic literature. For example, one of T urkey's most senior Masons, Selami Isindag, has a book entitled Mason- luktan Esinmeleler (Inspirations from Freemasonry). The purpose of this book is to train young Masons. Concerning the Masons' belief in the \"Great Architect of the Universe,\" he has this to say: Masonry is not godless. But the concept of God they have adopted is different from that of religion. The god of Masonry is an exalted principle. It is at the apex of the evolution . By criticizing our inner being, knowing ourselves and deliberately walking in the path of science, intelligence and virtue, we can lessen the angle between him and us. Then, this god does not possess the good and bad characteristics of human beings. It is not personified. It is not thought of as the guide of nature or humanity. It is the architect of the great working of the universe, of its unity and harmony. It is the totality of all the creatures in the universe, a total power encompassing everything, an energy . Despite all this, it cannot be accepted that it is a beginning... this is a great mystery. 42 In the same book, it is clear that when Freemasons speak of the \"Great Architect of the Universe,\" they mean nature, or, that they worship nature: Apart from nature there can be no power responsible for our thought or our activities ...The principles and doctrines of Masonry are scientific facts based on science and intelligence. God is the evolution. An element of it is the power of nature. So the absolute reality is the evolution itself and the energy that encompasses it. 43 The magazine Mimar Sinan , a publishing organization especially for T urkish Freemasons also gives expression to the same Masonic philosophy: The Great Architect of the Universe is a leaning toward eternity. It is an entering into eternity. For us, it is an approach. It entails the on-going search for absolute perfection in eternity. It forms a distance between the cur- r ent moment and the Thinking Freemason, or, consciousness. 44 IH HUMANISM REVISITED"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"II GLOBAL FREEMASONRY Some Masonic symbols."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"IJ This is the belief the Masons mean when they say, \"we believe in God, we absolutely do not accept atheists among us.\" It is not God that Masons worship, but naturalist and humanist concepts such as nature, evolution and humanity divinized by their philosophy. When we look briefly at Masonic literature, we may begin to see that this organization is nothing more than organized humanism, as well as r ecognize that its aim is to create throughout the whole world a secular, humanist order. These ideas were born among the humanists of four- teenth century Europe; present-day Masons still propose and defend them.

There are countless explanations, interpretations, quotations and alle- gories offered on this subject in Masonic publications. As we said at the beginning, humanism has turned its face from the Creator of humanity and accepted humans as \"the highest form of being in the universe.\" In fact, this implies the wor- ship of humanity. This irrational belief, that began with the Kabbalist humanists in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, continues today in modern Masonry. One of the fourteenth century's most fa- mous humanists was Pico Della Mirandola. His work entitled Conclusiones philosophicae, ca- balisticae, et theologicae was condemned by Pope Innocent VIII in 1489 as containing heretical ideas. Mirandola wrote that there is nothing in the world higher than the glory of mankind.

Indeed, this was a heretical idea because there is no other being to be glorified except God. Humanity is merely His creation. T oday, Masons proclaim Mirandola's heretical idea of the worship of humanity much more openly. For example, in a local Masonic booklet, it says: Primitive societies were weak and, because of this weakness, they di- vinized the power and phenomena around them. But Masonry divinizes only humanity. 45 In The Lost Keys of Freemasonry, Manly P. Hall explains that this Ma- sonic humanist doctrine goes back to Ancient Egypt: Man is a god in the making, and as in the mystic myths of Egypt , on the potter's wheel, he is being molded. When his light shines out to lift and preserve all things, he receives the triple crown of godhood, and joins that throng of Master Masons, who in their robe of Blue and Gold, are seeking to dispel the darkness of night with the triple light of the Masonic Lodge. 46 This is to say that according to the false belief of Masonry, human be- ings are gods, but only a grand master reaches the fullness of this divinity. The way to become a grand master is to fully reject the belief in God and the fact that human beings are His servants. This fact is briefly touched on by another writer, J.D. Buck, in his book Mystic Masonry : The only personal God Freemasonry accepts is humanity in toto . . . Hu- manity therefore is the only personal god that there is. 47 Evidently, Masonry is a kind of religion. But, it is not a monotheistic r eligion; it is a humanist religion and, therefore, a false religion. It enjoins the worship of humanity, not of God. Masonic writings insist on this point. In an article in the magazine T urk Mason (The Turkish Mason), it says, \" We always acknowledge that the high ideal of Masonry lies in 'Humanisme' doctrine .\" 48 Another Turkish publication explains that humanism is a religion: GLOBAL FREEMASONRY IK"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Far from dry sermons on religious dogmas, but a genuine religion.

H H U U M M A A N N I I S S T T M M O O R R A A L L T T H H E E O O R R Y Y T oday, Masons in many countries are engaged in an effort to intro- duce themselves to the rest of society. Using press conferences, Internet sites, newspaper advertisements and statements, they describe them- selves as an organization solely dedicated to the good of society. In some countries there are even charitable organizations supported by Masons. The same thing is said by the Rotary and Lion's Club organizations, which are \"light\" versions of Masonry. All of these organizations insist that they are working for the good of society. Certainly, to work for the good of society is not an undertaking to be discouraged, and we have no objection to it. But, behind their claim there is a deceptive message. Masons claim that there can be morality without r eligion, and that a moral world can be established without religion. And, the intention behind all their charitable work is to spread this message in society. We will see shortly why this claim is so deceitful. But, before that, it will be useful to consider the views of Masons on this subject. On the Ma- sons' Internet site, the possibility of \"morality without religion\" is de- scribed in this way: What is human? Where does he come from and where is he going?... How does a person live? How does he have to live? Religions try to answer these questions with the help of moral principles that they have set. How- ever they relate their principles with metaphysical concepts like God, IL HUMANISM REVISITED"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"heaven, hell, worship. And people have to find their principles of life without being involved in metaphysical problems, which they need to be- lieve in without comprehending.

They search their bases not in metaphysical concepts but inside a mature person living on this earth. 50 Masons who think in this way are totally opposed to a person believ- ing in God and performing acts of charity to gain His approval. For them, everything must be done only for the sake of humanity. We can clearly dis- cern this way of thinking in a book published by the Turkish lodges: Masonic morality is based on love for humanity. It totally rejects being good through hope for the future, a benefit, a reward, and paradise, out of fear of another person, a religious or political institution, unknown supernatural powers ... It only espouses and exalts being good in relation to the love for fam- ily, country, human beings and humanity. This is one of the most significant aims of Freemasonic evolution.

Without the moral discipline of religion there can be no sense of self-sacrifice for the r est of society. And, where this would appear to be accomplished, relation- ships are merely superficial. Those who have no sense of religious morality have no fear of God or respect for Him, and in those places where there is no fear of God, human beings are concerned only for their own gain. When people think that their personal interests are at stake, they cannot express true love, loyalty or affection. They show love and respect only to those who may be of benefit to them. This is because, according to this miscon- ception of theirs, they are in this world only once and, therefore, will take as much from it as they can. Moreover, according to this false belief, there is no retribution for any dishonesty or evil they commit in the world. Masonic literature is full of moral sermons which try to obfuscate this fact. But, actually, this morality without religion is nothing but sham rhetoric. History is full of examples to show that, without the self- discipline that religion confers upon the human spirit, and without divine law, true morality cannot in any way be established. A striking example of this was the great French Revolution of 1789. The Masons, who fomented the revolution, came forth with slogans shout- ing the moral ideals of \"liberty, equality and fraternity.\" Yet, tens of thou- sands of innocent people were sent to the guillotine, and the country soaked in blood. Even the leaders of the revolution themselves could not es- cape this savagery, but were sent to the guillotine, one after the other. In the nineteenth century, socialism was born from the notion of the possibility of morality without religion, and with even more disastrous r esults. Socialism supposedly demanded a just, equal society in which there was no exploitation and, to this end, proposed the abolition of reli- gion. However, in the twentieth century, in places such as the Soviet Union, the Eastern Block, China, Indo-China, several countries in Africa and Central America, it subjected people to dreadful misery.

(In his clas- sic book entitled The New Class, the Y ugoslavian thinker Milovan Dji- las, explains that the communist leaders, known as \"nomenklatura,\" formed a \"privileged class\" con- trary to the claims of socialism.) Also today, when we look within Masonry itself, which is constantly pronouncing its ideas of \"service to society\" and \"sacrifice for humanity,\" we do not find a very clean record. In many countries, Masonry has been the focus of relationships for ill-gotten material gain. In the P2 Masonic Lodge scandal of Italy in the 1980's, it came to light that the Masons main- tained a close relationship with the mafia, and that the directors of the lodge were engaged in activities such as arms-smuggling, the drug trade or money laundering. It was also revealed that they arranged assaults on their rivals and on those who had betrayed them. In the \"Great Eastern Lodge Scandal\" of France in 1992, and in the \"Clean Hands\" operation in England, reported in the English press in 1995, the activities of Masonic lodges in the interests of illegal profit became clear. The Masons' idea of \"humanist morality\" is only a sham. That such a thing should happen is inevitable, because, as we said at the beginning, morality is only established in society by the moral disci- pline of religion.

In the Qur'an, after God tells of believers' self-sacrifice, He commands \"...It is the people who are safe-guarded from the avarice of their own selves who are successful.\" (Qur'an, 59: 9). This is the true basis of morality. In the Sura Furqan of the Qur'an, the nature of the morality of true be- lievers is described in this way: The servants of the All-Merciful are those who walk lightly on the earth and, who, when the ignorant speak to them, say, \"Peace\"; those who pass the night prostrating and standing before their Lord... those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor mean, but take a stance mid way between the two; those who do not call on any other god together with God and do not kill anyone God has made inviolate, except with the right to do so, and do not fornicate... those who do not bear false witness and who, when they pass by worth- less talk, pass by with dignity; those who, when they are reminded of the Signs of their Lord, do not turn their backs, deaf and blind to them. (Qur'an, 25: 63-73) That is, the basic duty of believers is to submit to God in humility, \"not to turn their backs, as if they were deaf and blind when they are re- minded of His signs.\" Because of this duty, a person is saved from the self- ishness of the ego, worldly passions, ambitions, and the concern to make himself liked by others. The kind of morality mentioned in the verses above is attained by these means alone. For this reason, in a society lack- ing in love and fear of God and faith in Him, there is no morality.

But, this raises an important ques- tion: do Masons reserve this belief for themselves only, or do they wish it to be adopted by others as well? When we look at Masonic writings, we can clearly see the answer to this question: the goal of this organization is to spread the humanist phi- losophy throughout the world, and to eradicate the monotheistic religions (Islam, Christianity and Judaism). For example, in an article published in the Masonic magazine Mimar Sinan, it says, \"Masons do not search for the origin of the ideas of evil, jus- tice and honesty beyond the physical world, they believe that these things arise from a person's social conditions, social relationships and what he strives for in his life.\" and adds, \" Masonry is trying to spread this idea throughout the whole world .\" 53 Selami Isindag, a senior Turkish Mason, writes: According to Masonry, in order to rescue humanity from a morality of the supernatural based on religious sources , it is necessary to establish a moral- ity that is based on love for humanity which is not relative. In its traditional moral principles, Masonry has taken into account the tendencies of the human organism, its needs and their satisfaction, the rules of social life and their organization, conscience, freedom of thought and speech and, finally, all the things that go into the formation of natural life. Because of this, its goal is to establish and foster human morality in all societies . 54 JH HUMANISM REVISITED"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"What Master Mason Isindag means by \"rescuing human beings from a morality based on religious sources\" is the alienation of all people from r eligion. In the same book, Isindag explains this goal and its \"principles for the establishment of an advanced civilization\": Masonry's positive principles are necessary and sufficient for the establish- ment of an advanced civilization. They are: -The acceptance that the impersonal God (the Great Architect of the Uni- verse) is evolution itself. -The rejection of the belief in revelation, mysticism and empty beliefs. -The superiority of rational humanism and labor. The first of the three articles above entails the rejection of the exis- tence of God. (Masons do not believe in God, but in the Great Architect of the Universe, and the above quotation shows that with this term, they mean evolution.) The second article rejects revelation from God and reli- gious knowledge based on it. (Isindag himself defines this as \"empty be- liefs.\") And the third article exalts humanism and the humanist concept of \"labor\" (as in Communism). If we consider how entrenched these ideas have become in the world today, we can appreciate the influence of Masonry in it. There is another important thing to take note of here: how has Ma- sonry put into motion its mission against religion? When we look at Ma- sonic writings, we see that they want to destroy religion, especially on the societal level, by means of mass \"propaganda.\" Master Mason Selami Isindag throws a lot of light on this matter in this passage from his book: ...Even overly repressive regimes have not been successful in their attempts to destroy the institution of religion. Indeed, the harsh excesses of political methods, in their attempt to enlighten society by rescuing people from empty r eligious faith and dogmas produced an adverse reaction: the places of worship they wanted close are today fuller than ever, and the faith and dogmas that that they outlawed have even more adherents.

Isindag says that repression of religion will make religious peo- ple more highly motivated and will strengthen religion. Therefore, in order to prevent religion from being strengthened, Isindag thinks Masons should destroy religion on the intellectual level. What he means by \"posi- tive science and principles of logic and wisdom\" is not really science, logic or wisdom. What he means is merely a humanist, materialist philosophy that uses these catch-phrases as camouflage, as in the case of Darwinism. Isindag asserts that, when these ideas are disseminated in society, \"only the humanist elements in religion will gain respect,\" that is, what will be left of religion will be only those elements approved by the humanist phi- losophy. In other words, they want to reject the basic truths that lie at the foundation of monotheistic religion (Isindag calls them vain beliefs and dogmas). These truths are the ultimate realities such as that man is created by God and is responsible to Him. In short, Masons aim at destroying the elements of faith that consti- tute the essence of religion. They want to reduce the role of religion as merely a cultural element that expresses its ideas on a number of general moral questions. The way to accomplish this, according to the Masons, is to impose atheism on the society in the guise of science and reason. Ulti- mately though, their goal is to remove religion from its position as even a cultural element, and establish a totally atheist world.

We will see later that the theory of evolution is one of Masons' principal means of pro- paganda. Moreover, they aim to build a society that does not mention even the name of God or religion, but caters only to human pleasure, de- sires and worldly ambition. This will be a society formed by people who have \"made (God) into something to cast disdainfully behind their backs\" (Qur'an, 11: 92), similar to the people of Madyan mentioned in the Qur'an. In this culture of ignorance there is no room for the fear or love of God, doing His will, performing acts of worship, nor is there any thought for the hereafter. In fact, these ideas are thought to be old-fashioned and characteristic of uneducated people. This message is being constantly re- peated in films, comic strips and novels. In this great enterprise of deception, the Masons continually play a leadership role. But, there are also many other groups and individuals en- gaged in the same work. Masons accept them as \"honorary Masons,\" and count them as their allies because they are all one in their shared humanist philosophy.

This is be- cause this ideology is wholly an ideology of human beings and of humanity. 58 This persistent battle against religion relies on two basic arguments or justifications: the materialist philosophy and Darwin's theory of evolution.

It was adopted by certain Jews and kept alive within Kabbalist doctrine. On the other hand, a number of Greek thinkers adopted the same philosophy, and reinterpreted it and perpetu- ated it as the school of thought known as \"Hermeticism.\" The word Hermeticism comes from the name of Hermes, the Greek counterpart for the Ancient Egyptian god \"Thoth.\" In other words, Her- meticism is the Ancient Greek version of Ancient Egyptian philosophy. Master Mason Selami Isindag explains the origins of this philosophy and its place in modern Masonry: In Ancient Egypt there was a religious society that bequeathed a system of thought and belief to Hermeticism. Masonry held something similar to this. For example, those who had come to a certain level attended cere- monies of the society, revealed their spiritual thoughts and feelings and trained those who were at a lower level. Pythagoras was a Hermeticist trained among them. Again, the organization and the philosophical sys- tems of the Alexandrian school and of Neoplatonism had their origins in Ancient Egypt and there are some significant similarities between them and Masonic rites. 60 Isindag is much more overt about the influence of Ancient Egypt on the origins of Masonry when he declares, \" Freemasonry is a social and rit- ual organization whose beginnings go back to Ancient Egypt .\" 61 Many other Masonic authorities maintain that the origins of Masonry go back to secret societies of ancient pagan cultures, such as those of An-"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"GLOBAL FREEMASONRY KE The Ancient Egyp- tians believed in the myth that mat- ter was eternal, and that the order of the universe arose due to a mythical \"self-or- ganizational\" power of matter. cient Egypt and Greece.

Members of these mystery schools were accepted only after a long period of study and initiation ceremonies. Among these schools, the first is thought to have been the school of \"Osiris\" based on the events of this god's birth, youth, struggle against darkness, death and resurrection. These themes were ritually dramatized in cere- monies performed by clergy and in this way the rituals and symbols being presented were much more effective because of the actual participation... Y ears later, these rites formed the first circles of a series of initiated broth- erhoods that would continue under the name of Masonry. Such brother- hoods always established the same ideals and, when under oppression, were able to lead their lives secretly. They were able to survive to the pre- sent-day because they continually changed their names and their forms ."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"But they remained faithful to ancient symbolism and their particular char- acter and passed their ideas on to each other as a legacy. In order to mitigate against the possibility that their established ideas may threaten the estab- lishment, they established secret laws among themselves. In order to protect themselves from the wrath of ignorant people, they took refuge in Operative Masonry which contained the discreet rules of their own trade. They insem- inated this with their ideas which later influenced the formation of the mod- ern Speculative Masonry we know today. 62 In the above quotation, Layiktez praises the societies that were the origin of Masonry, and claims they kept themselves hidden to protect themselves from \"ignorant people.\" If we can leave aside this subjective claim for a moment, we can understand from the quotation above that Masonry is a present-day representation of societies that were founded in the ancient pagan civilizations of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and Rome. Of these three civilizations, the oldest is Egypt; it is possible, there- fore, to say that the main source of Masonry is Ancient Egypt. (We saw earlier that basic connection between this pagan tradition and modern Masons is the Templars.) It is necessary to recall at this point that Ancient Egypt was one of the most referred to examples of a godless system as revealed by God in the Qur'an. It is the true archetype of an evil system. Many verses relate to us of the pharaohs that governed Egypt and their inner-circles, their cruelty, injustice, wickedness and excesses. Moreover, the Egyptians were a per- verse people, that acquiesced to the system of their pharaohs, and be- lieved in their false gods. Despite this, Masons maintain that their origins lie in Ancient Egypt, and regard that civilization as praiseworthy.

The Memphis temple where he had been trained has historical significance. In the city of Thebes there were advanced schools. Pythagoras, Plato and Cicero were initiated into Masonry in these cities . 63 Masonic writings do not laud Ancient Egypt merely in broad terms; they express praise and sympathy for the pharaohs who governed that cruel system. In another article from Mimar Sinan magazine it is stated: The basic duty of the pharaoh was to find Light. To exalt Hidden Light in a much more vivid and powerful way.... As we Masons are trying to con- struct the Temple of Solomon, so did the Ancient Egyptians try to build Ehram, or the House of Light. The ceremonies performed in the temples of Ancient Egypt were divided into several degrees. These degrees had two sections, small and great. The small degree was divided into one, two and three; after these the Great degrees began. 64 It can be seen from this that the \"light\" which the pharaohs of ancient Egypt and Masons search for is the same . This can also be interpreted as suggesting that Masonry is a modern representative of the philosophy of the Egyptian pharaohs. The nature of this philosophy is revealed by God in the Qur'an in the judgment He passed over Pharaoh and his people: \"They are a people of deviators.\" (Qur'an, 27: 12) In other verses, the godless system of Egypt is described in this way: Pharaoh called to his people, saying, \"My people, does the king- dom of Egypt not belong to me? Do not all these rivers flow under my control? Do you not then see?...\" In that way he swayed his people and they succumbed to him. They were a people of deviators.

Symbols are very important in Masonry. Masons reveal the true meaning of their philosophy to their members through allegory. A Mason, who advances stage by stage through the 33 degrees of the Masonic hier- archy, learns new meanings for each symbol at every stage. In this way, members descend step by step into the depths of Masonic philosophy. An article in Mimar Sinan magazine describes this function of their symbols: We all know that Masonry expresses its ideas and ideals by means of sym- bols and stories, that is, allegories . These stories go back to the first ages of history. We can even say that they stretch back to legends of prehistory. In this way, Masonry has shown the antiquity of its ideals and has gained a rich source of symbols. 65 The conceptions of the Ancient Egyptians are the most prominent of these symbols and legends, that stretch back to the first ages of history. Everywhere in Masonic lodges, and frequently in Masonic publications, drawings of pyramids and sphinxes and hieroglyphs can be found. In an article in Mimar Sinan magazine, about the ancient sources of Masonry, it states: If we choose Ancient Egypt as the \"most ancient\" I don't think we will be mistaken.

A great number of the writings that deal with the subject of Masonry stress this fact. The pyramid below the eye in the triangle attracts relatively little no- tice. However, this pyramid is extremely meaningful and enlightening for the understanding of the philosophy of Masonry. An American author, Robert Hieronimus, wrote a doctoral thesis on the United States' seal in which he provided some very important information. The title of Hieron- imus' thesis was \" An Historic Analysis of the Reverse of the American Great Seal and Its Relationship to the Ideology of Humanist Psychol- ogy .\" His thesis shows that the founders of America, who originally adopted the seal, had been Masons, and that they, therefore, espoused the humanist philosophy.

There- fore the six-pointed star is a seal of a prophet, a sacred symbol. But, Masons have a different conception. They do not accept the six- pointed star as a symbol of the Prophet Solomon, but as a symbol of An- cient Egyptian paganism. An article in Mimar Sinan entitled \"Allegory and Symbols in our Rituals\" relates a number of interesting facts about this matter: An equilateral triangle with three points equidistant from one another show that these values are equivalent. This symbol adopted by the Masons is known as the Star of David; it is a hexagram formed by the imposition of one equilateral triangle on another.

But in Masonry, we no doubt use this symbol in the universal sense that it had in Ancient Egypt . In this sense, we have combined two important forces together. If you erase the upper and lower bases of the two equilateral triangles, you will find this rare symbol that you know very well. 69 Actually, we must interpret all Masonic symbols in relation to Solomon's Temple in this way. As revealed in the Qur'an, Solomon was a prophet who some wished to slander and show as having been godless. In a verse of the Qur'an, God says, \"They follow what the satans recited in the reign of Solomon. Solomon did not become unbeliever, but the sa- tans did...\" (Qur'an, 2: 102) Masons have adopted this corrupt idea mistakenly attributed to the Prophet Solomon, regarding him as a representative of the pagan beliefs of Ancient Egypt. For this reason, they afford him an important place in their doctrines. In his book The Occult Conspiracy, the American historian Michael Howard says that, since the Middle Ages, Solomon (God forbid) has been regarded as a magician and as one who introduced some pagan ideas into Judaism. 70 Howard explains that the Masons regard the Temple of Solomon as a \"pagan temple,\" and as important for this reason. 71 This false image fabricated against the Prophet Solomon, who was a devout and obedient servant of God, shows the true origins of Masonry. T T H H E E D D O O U U B B L L E E C C O O L L U U M M N N An indispensable part of the décor of a Masonic lodge is the double column in the entrance. The words \"Jachin\" and \"Boaz\" are inscribed on them, in imitation of the two columns at the entrance to Solomon's Tem- ple. But actually, the Masons do not intend these columns as a memorial to Solomon; they are an expression of those corrupt insinuations against Solomon.

In the entrance to the Amenta temple dedicated to Ptah, the chief god of Egypt, there were two columns as in the temple of Solomon.

The in- teresting matter is that these Ma- sonic messages are closely related to Ancient Egyptian paganism. Mimar Sinan explains it in this way: It is known that there is a clear connection between Ancient Egyptian and Masonic rituals . No matter how much those who attempted to interpret the Magic Flute as \"a story about the Far East,\" at its foundation are Egyptian ritu- als.

We can learn this from a book written by one of the greatest Masons of all time. In his book Morals and Dogma, Albert Pike wrote the following about the compass and square: The square... is a natural and appropriate Symbol of this earth... The her- maphroditic figure is the symbol of the double nature anciently assigned to the Deity, as Generator and Producer, as Brahm and Maya among the Ari- ans, Osiris and Isis among the Egyptians. As the Sun was male, so the Moon was female. 78 This means that the compass and square, the most well known sym- bol of Masonry, is a symbol of Arian paganism and which dates back to Ancient Egypt or before the advent of Christianity.

The Master Mason Necdet Egeran describes what higher degree Masons think about this matter: Some Masons even understand Masonry as only a kind of half religion, half charitable fraternal institution where they can establish pleasant social rela- tionships and treat it accordingly. Others think that the purpose of Masonry is only to make good people better. Still others think that Masonry is a place to build character. In short, those who do not know how to read or write the sacred language of Masonry understand the meaning of its symbols and al- legories in this way or some such similar way.

That is, the outward appearance of Masonry as charitable or social organization is actually a guise to hide the philosophy of the organization. In reality, Masonry is an organization that aims to systematically impose a specific philosophy on its members as on the rest of society.

In Masonic writings we can read detailed accounts of these basic elements of material- ist philosophy. In his book, Masonluktan Esinmeleler (Inspirations from Freema- sonry), Master Mason Selami Isindag writes about Masonry's pure materi- alist philosophy: All space, the atmosphere, the stars, nature, all animate and inanimate things are composed of atoms. Human beings are nothing more than a sponta- neously occurring collection of atoms. A balance in the flow of electricity among atoms assures the survival of living things. When this balance is de- stroyed (not the electricity in the atoms), we die, return to the earth and are dispersed into atoms. That is, we have come from matter and energy and we will return to matter and energy. Plants make use of our atoms, and all living things including us make use of plants. Everything is made of the same substance. But because our brains are most highly evolved of all animals, consciousness appeared . If we look at the results of experimental psychol- ogy, we see that our three-fold psychic experience of emotion-mind-will is the r esult of the balanced functioning of the cells in the brain's cortex and hor- mones... Positivist science accepts that nothing came into existence from nothing, and nothing will be destroyed. As a result, it can be concluded that human beings feel grateful and obliged to no power. The universe is a to- tality of energy with no beginning or end. Everything is born from this to- tality of energy, evolving and dying, but never totally disappearing . Things change and are transformed. There is really no such thing as death or loss; there is continuous change, transformation and formation. But it is not possi- GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DCG"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"ble to explain this great question and universal secret by means of scientific laws. But extra-scientific explanations are imaginary descriptions, dogma and vain belief. According to positivist science and reason, there is no spirit apart from the body . 81 Y ou will find views identical to those above in the books of materialist thinkers such as K. Marx, F. Engels, V .I. Lenin, G. Politzer, C. Sagan, and J. Monod. They all accept the basic materialist myth that the universe has ex- isted for ever, matter is the one absolute existent entity, human beings are composed of matter and are without spirit, matter evolved in and out of it- self, and life appeared as a result of chance. It is right to use the term myth because, contrary to Isindag's claim that \"these processes are the result of positivist science and reason,\" all these views have been invalidated by sci- entific discoveries in the second half of the twentieth century. For example, the Big Bang theory, accepted in scientific circles as proven, shows scientif- DCH MATERIALISM REVISITED The materialist theories in Masonic literature are no different from those found in the writings of materialist ideologues such as Marx, Engels and Lenin."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"ically that the universe was created from nothing millions of years ago. The Laws of Thermodynamics show that matter does not have the ability to or- ganize itself and that the balance and order in the universe is the result therefore of a conscious creation. By demonstrating the extraordinary de- sign in living things, biology proves the existence of a Creator that made them all. (For detailed information, see Harun Yahya's The Creation of the Universe, Darwinism Refuted, The Evolution Deceit ) In his article, Isindag continues to explain that Masons are, in fact, materialists and, therefore, atheists, and that they use the concept of the \"Great Architect of the Universe\" in reference to a material evolution: I want very briefly to touch on some principles, thoughts adopted by Ma- sons: According to Masonry, life begins from a single cell, changes, is trans- formed and evolves into a human being. The nature, cause or purpose or conditions of this beginning cannot be known. Life comes from a combina- tion of matter and energy and returns to it. If we accept the Great Architect of the Universe as a sublime principle, an endless horizon of goodness and beauty, the apex of the evolution, its highest stage and the ideal to- wards which human beings strive, and if we do not personalize it, we may be rescued from dogmatism. 82 As we see, one of the most basic principles of Masonic philosophy is that things come from matter and go back to matter . An interesting as- pect of this view is that Masons do not regard this philosophy as particu- lar to just themselves; they want to disseminate these ideas to the whole of society. Isindag continues: Am ason trained with these principles and doctrines accepts the duty to ed- ucate people... and to edify them by teaching them the principles of reason and positivist science . In this way, Masonry is addressed to people. It works on behalf of people despite the people . 83 These words show two aspects of Masonry's perceived role in society; 1.

They intend to do this despite the people. That is, even if a society believes in God and has no desire to accept a materialist philosophy, Ma- sonry will be dogged in their attempt to change people's world view with- out their consent. There is an important matter that we must take notice of here: the ter- minology that Masons use is deceptive. In their writings, especially those directed at the rest of society, they employ language designed to show their philosophy as harmless, intelligent and tolerant. An example of this can be seen in the quotation above, in the notion of \"edifying people by teaching them the principles of reason and positivist science.\" Indeed, Ma- sonic philosophy has nothing to do with \"science and reason\"; it has to do with an outmoded myth that flies in the face of science. It is not Masonry's goal to edify people; their deliberate intention is to impose their philoso- phy on people. When they maintain that they are determined to do this despite the people, we see that they are not tolerant, but in possession of a totalitarian world-view. I I I I . .

We regard those who have had their names immortalized as persons who have spent all their efforts, either for their contemporaries or for those generations that follow them, to make people happy and to ensure for them a more humane world. Their aim is to exalt the humane impulses that influence the lives of living people... Human beings who have sought immortality throughout the centuries can achieve it through the work they do, the services they perform and the ideas they produce, and this will give their lives meaning. As Tolstoy explained, \"Paradise will then have been es- tablished here on earth and people will attain the highest possible good.\" 84 On the same topic, Master Mason Isindag writes: THE SUBSTANCE OF EVERYTHING: Masonry understands this as energy and matter. They say that everything changes stage by stage and will return again to matter. Scientifically, this is defined as death. Mysticism on this mat- ter, that is, the belief that, of the two forces of which a person is composed— spirit and body— the body will die and the spirit will not; that spirits pass away to the world of spirits, continue their existence there and come back into another body when God commands, does not fit in with the change- transformation ideas accepted by Masonry . The ideas of Masonry on this matter can be expressed in this way: \" After your death, the only things that will be left of you, and not die, are the memories of your maturity and what you have accomplished .\" This idea is a kind of philosophical way of thinking based on the principles of positivist science and reason.

Muslims also give importance to art; by producing it, they try to beautify the world. The difference lies in intention. A Muslim is interested in art to the extent that it expresses the beauty and esthetic notions that God has given to human beings. Godless people are mistaken in regarding art as a way to immortality.

On the contrary, modern scientific discoveries demonstrate that human consciousness cannot be reduced to matter, and that consciousness cannot be explained in terms of the functions of the brain. A look at the relevant literature shows that scientists have reached no conclusion as a result of their efforts, spurred on by materialist belief, to re duce consciousness to the brain, and many have ultimately given up. T oday, many researchers are of the opinion that human consciousness comes from an unknown source beyond the neurons in the brain and the molecules and atoms that form them. After years of study, one of these researchers, Wilder Penfield, r eached the conclusion that the existence of spirit is an undeniable fact: After years of striving to explain the mind on the basis of brain-action alone, I have come to the conclusion that it is simpler (and far easier to be logical) if one adopts the hypothesis that our being does consist of two fundamental el- GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DDC"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"ements [brain and mind (or soul)]. ...Because it seems to be certain that it will always be quite impossible to explain the mind on the basis of neuronal action within the brain... I am forced to choose the proposition that our being is to be explained on the basis of two fundamental elements .\" [brain and mind, or body and soul] 86 What leads scientists to this conclusion is the fact that consciousness can never be described in terms of material factors alone. The human brain is like a marvelous computer, in which information from our five senses are collected and processed. But, this computer does not have a sense of \"self\"; it cannot conceive, feel or think about the sensations that it r eceives. The prominent English physicist, Roger Penrose, in his book The Emperor's New Mind , writes: What is it that gives a particular person his individual identity ? Is it , to some extent, the very atoms that compose his body ? Is his identity dependent upon the particular choice of electrons, protons, and other particles that compose those atoms? There are at least two reasons why this cannot be so. In the first place, there is a continual turnover in the material of any living person's body. This applies in particular to the cells in a person's brain, despite the fact that no new actual brain cells are produced after birth. The vast majority of atoms in each living cell (including each brain cell)—and, indeed, virtually the entire material of our bodies—has been replaced many times since birth. The second r eason comes from quantum physics...If an electron in a person's brain were to be exchanged with an electron in a brick, then the state of the system would be exactly the same state as it was before, not merely indistinguishable from it! The same holds for protons and for any other kind of particle, and for whole atoms, molecules, etc. If the entire material content of a person were to be ex- changed with corresponding particles in the bricks of his house then, in a strong sense, nothing would have happened whatsoever . 87 Penrose clearly says that, even if all human atoms were exchanged with brick atoms, the qualities that make a human being conscious would DDD MATERIALISM REVISITED"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"re main completely the same. Or we could think of it conversely. If we exchanged the par- ticles of the atoms in the brain with the atoms in bricks, the bricks would not become con- scious. In short, what makes human beings human is not a material quality; it is a spiri- tual one, and it is clear that its source is an en- tity apart from matter. In the conclusion of his book, Penrose comments: Consciousness seems to me to be such an impor- tant phenomenon that I simply cannot believe that it is something just \"accidentally\" conjured up by a complicated computation. It is the phenome- non whereby the universe's very existence is made known. 88 What is materialism's standpoint, then, in light of these findings? How can materialists claim that human beings are composed only of mat- ter, and that a human being with intelligence, feelings, thoughts, memory and senses, could come to be by the chance composition of lifeless, uncon- scious atoms? How can they possibly think that such a process is possible? These questions concern all materialists. But, on these topics, Masonic writings contain ideas still more curious than anything found among the writings of materialists. When we look at these writings, we see clearly that behind the materialist philosophy lies the \"worship of matter.\" M M A A S S O O N N I I C C M M A A T T E E R R I I A A L L I I S S M M : : T T H H E E D D I I V V I I N N I I Z Z A A T T I I O O N N O O F F M M A A T T T T E E R R It is necessary to understand clearly what the materialist philosophy is: Those who espouse this philosophy believe that the great order and GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DDE Prof. Penrose maintains that materi- alism can never account for the human mind."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"balance of the universe, and the millions of species of living things in the world, including human beings, came about only by the activity of the atoms that comprise matter. In other words, they believe that lifeless and unconscious atoms are creators. No matter how modern this idea may seem, it is, in fact, a reemer- gence of a belief that has existed since the earliest ages of history: Idolatry. Those who worshipped idols believed that the statues and totems they worshipped had spirit and power. In other words, they attributed con- sciousness and great power to lifeless, unconscious matter. Surely, this is obviously nonsensical. In the Qur'an, God refers to the irrationality of pa- ganism. In the stories of the Prophets, the spuriousness of pagan beliefs is especially emphasized. For example, Abraham asked his father, \"Father, why do you worship what can neither hear nor see and is not of any use to you at all?\" (Qur'an, 19: 42) It is clear that, to attribute divinity to lifeless matter, that cannot hear or see, \"is not of any use to one at all,\" and has no power, is evidently very foolish. Materialists are modern examples of idolaters. They do not worship statues and totems made of wood and stone, but believe in the idea that matter constitutes, not only these, but all bodies, and think that this matter has limitless power, intelligence and knowledge. Masonic writings have some interesting things to say about this, because Masons openly confess this pagan belief, which is the essence of materialism. An article in Mimar Sinan magazine declares: In order for a material object to come to be, atoms come together in a certain order. The force that causes this organization is the spirit possessed by each atom . Because every spirit is a consciousness, every created thing is an intelligent consciousness. And every created thing is intelligent to the same degree. A human being, an animal, a bacterium and a molecule are all intel- ligent to the same degree. 89 We notice that it is claimed here that every atom has intelligence and DDF MATERIALISM REVISITED"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"consciousness. The Masonic writer making this claim proposes that every thing has consciousness because of the atoms it possesses and, because he r ejects the existence of the human spirit, he regards a human being as a mass of atoms, just like an animal or lifeless molecules. However, the fact is this: lifeless matter (atoms) has no spirit, con- sciousness or intelligence. This is a fact proved to us by both observation and experiment. Only living things have consciousness, which is the re- sult of the \"soul\" that God has given to them. Of all living things, human beings are benefited with the highest degree of consciousness because they possess a unique spirit that God has given to them. In other words, consciousness is not found in lifeless matter, as the Masons believe, but in beings that have spirit. But, in order not to accept the existence of God, Masons resort to the foolish belief that attributes \"spirit\" to atoms. This materialist belief espoused by Masons is a new expression of a pagan belief called \"animism,\" which supposes that every material thing in nature (rocks, mountains, winds, water, etc.) has its own spirit and con- sciousness. The Greek philosopher Aristotle combined this belief with ma- terialism (the belief that matter is uncreated and is the only ab- solute) and even today, the at- tribution of consciousness to lifeless things—being the essence of materialism—has become a kind of contempo- rary paganism. GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DDG Materialism accepts the creative abil- ity of lifeless and unconscious mat- ter. In other words, it turns matter into an idol. Masons believe that atoms have spirit and openly admit to their belief in such a superstition."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Masonic writings are full of interesting accounts of this belief. An ar- ticle in Mimar Sinan entitled \"The Way of Truth\" maintains: If we accept the animist hierarchy that spirit exists in an atom , that a mole- cule directs the spirit in an atom, that a cell directs the spirit in a molecule, that an organ directs the spirit in a cell, is not the main spirit that directs the whole body the god of these lesser spirits? 90 This false and primitive doctrine leads Masons to believe that the bal- ance and order in the universe is effected by lifeless matter. Again, in Mimar Sinan , an article has appeared about the world's geological devel- opment. It states: This surface deterioration occurs so subtly that we can say that the present state of life has been attained as a result of this hidden intelligence in magma . If this were not so, water would not collect in hollows and the earth would be completely covered by water. 91 Another article in the magazine Mimar Sinan claims that the first liv- ing cells, and those that multiplied from them, were conscious, formed a plan and implemented it: The beginning of life on earth happened when a single cell came to be. This single cell immediately began to move and, under a vital and truly rebellious impulse, divided in two and continued along this path of infinite division. But these separated cells perceive no purpose to their wandering and, as if fearing this wandering and under a powerful instinctive drive of self-preser- vation, these separated cells co-operate among themselves, come together and work in a total democratic harmony and self-sacrifice in the creation of those organs critical for life. 92 But, contrary to what is asserted in this quotation, there is no con- sciousness in a living cell. To believe this is nothing but superstition.

Another common expression of the superstitious tenets of Masonry and its materialism is the notion of \" Mother Nature .\" We encounter this expression in documentary films, books, magazines and even commer- cials; it is used to express the belief that the lifeless matter that composes nature (nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, etc.) has a conscious power, and that it has by itself created human beings and all living things. This myth is not based on observation or logical reasoning, but is intended to win people over by means of mass indoctrination. The purpose is for peo- ple to forget God, the real Creator, turning instead to paganism, in which \"nature\" is regarded as the creator. Masonry strives to give shape to this creed, strengthen and dissemi- nate it, and supports all social forces that it regards as being its allies.

In other words, the theory of evolution proposes the existence of a self-con- tained system, that has organized itself without a creator, and spontaneously brings living things into being. This idea, that nature organizes itself without a creator, is called \"naturalism.\" The theory of naturalism is as absurd as the idea that a library could create itself without writ- ers. But, since the earliest ages of history, this idea has been defended by numerous thinkers based merely on their philosophical and ideological whims, and been adopted by a number of civiliza- tions. Naturalism was born and flourished in pagan societies such as Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. But, with the spread of Christianity, this pagan philosophy was largely abandoned, and the idea that God created the whole of nature and the universe came to dominate. In a similar manner, as Islam spread throughout the East, naturalist ideas, and pagan beliefs, such as Zoroastrianism and Shamanism, were eradicated, and the fact of cre- ation was accepted. The theory of materialist evolution was developed by the pagan philosophers in Ancient Greece."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DEE Nevertheless, the naturalist philosophy persisted underground. It was preserved by secret societies and emerged again under more suitable circumstances. In the Christian world, as we mentioned at the beginning of this book, naturalism was preserved by the Masons, and other secret societies who followed their lead. A Turkish magazine, named Mason , published for distribution to members of the order, provides the follow- ing interesting information: Those who arrived at new discoveries in the world of natural phenomena and events without taking God into account were forced to keep their dis- coveries to themselves. Research was done secretly and even those who were engaged in similar research had to keep their relationship hidden. This secrecy required the use of several signs and symbols in the course of pro- jects which were undertaken. 94 What is meant here by \"new discoveries\" is an understanding of sci- ence aligned to naturalism, a theory that does not accept the existence of God. This distorted approach to scientific study was developed secretly in esoteric societies that needed to use signs and symbols for this purpose, and so the roots of Masonry were established. One of these so-called secret societies, responsible for planting the r oots of Masonry, was the Rose-Cross (Rosicrucian) order, a sort of meet- ing point between the Templars and Masons. This order, first heard of in the fifteenth century, created a fury of interest in alchemy, especially in Europe, of which its members were said to possess secret knowledge. But the most important legacy of the Rose Cross order today is the naturalist philosophy, and the idea of evolution, of which it is a part. The Mason de- clares that the roots of Masonry go back to the Templars and the Rosicru- cians, stressing the evolutionist philosophy of the latter: Speculative Masonry or the contemporary organization of Masonry is founded on Medieval construction guilds we refer to as Operative Masonry.

Its members were widely engaged in alchemy.... The most important characteristic of its members was the fact that they believed that every stage of development was a stage in the process of evolution. For this reason, they placed naturalism at the basis of their philosophies and became known the \" naturalists .\" 95 Another Masonic organization to have developed the idea of evolu- tion was not in the West but it was another Masonic order founded in the East. Grand Master Selami Isindag provides the following information, in an article entitled \"Masonry and Us From Its Foundation Until Today\": In the Islamic world there was a counterpart of Masonry called the Ikhwan as-Safa' [The Brethren of Purity] . This society was founded in Basra in the time of the Abbasids and published an encyclopedia composed of 54 large volumes. 17 of these dealt with natural science and it contained scientific explanations that closely resembled those of Darwin. These found their way even to Spain and had an influence on Western though t. 96 Though it developed in the Islamic world, this society distanced it- self from basic Islamic tenets. It was influenced by Ancient Greek philoso- phy, which it expressed by means of an esoteric symbolism. Selami Isindag continues: This society originated in the Ismaili sect and its basic purpose was to make re ligious dogmas intelligible by allegorical and symbolic explanations. Its philosophy was influenced by Pythagoras and Plato .

But all this knowledge was kept secret and was given only to those deemed worthy to receive it. So, the origins of Masonry is based on these foundations. Some of the symbolic meanings of these ele- ments were not contrary to science and logic and so survive in various places in our rituals today. 97 The words quoted above, \"purged of vain religious beliefs and dog- mas\" mean that initiates were made to reject religion at all. That is how the Mason Isindag defines religion. However, as we examined in earlier sec- tions, \"vain belief and dogma\" is a euphemism particular to Masonic phi- losophy. It must be recognized that Masonry, or any other materialist group, express such anti-religious ideas without logical justification; they r ely only on propaganda and suggestion. Because they cannot denounce r eligion rationally, they resort to these methods of suggestion and words selected to create a particular psychological effect. From the quotation above, we learn that the Ikhwan as-Safa', a parallel society of Freemasonry in the Islamic world, carried on activities much like those of the modern Masons. Their method was to espouse a pagan phi- losophy contrary to true religion, to express that philosophy by means of symbols, and to introduce this secret philosophy to its members gradually. In the history of Islam there have been various thinkers who in this way distanced themselves from Islam, and were influenced by the An- cient Greeks' materialist and evolutionist myths.

That period in which materialist and evolu- tionist ideas gained widespread acceptance in Euro- pean society, and influenced it in distancing itself from religion, is known as the Enlightenment. Surely, those who selected this word (that is those who characterized this change of ideas positively as a move into the light) were the leaders of this devia- tion. They described the earlier period as the \"Dark Age\" and blamed religion for it, claiming that Eu- r ope became enlightened when it was secularized and held religion at a distance. This biased and false perspective is still today one of the basic propaganda mechanisms of those who oppose reli- gion. In fact, the Enlightenment brought no positive results to the West. The most important result of the Enlightenment, which occurred in France, was the French Revolution, that turned the country into a sea of blood. Today Enlightenment influenced literature praises the French Rev- olution; however, the Revolution cost France much and contributed to so- cial conflicts that were to last into the twentieth century. The analysis of the French Revolution and the Enlightenment by the famous British thinker, Edmund Burke, is very telling. In his famous book, Reflections on the Revolution in France , published in 1790, he criticized both the idea of the Enlightenment and its fruit, the French Revolution; in his opinion, that movement destroyed the basic values that held society together, such as r eligion, morality and family structure, and paved the way towards terror and anarchy.

This had led some historians to the opinion that it is difficult to distinguish between Jacobin- ism and Masonry in France of this period. (See Harun Yahya's New Ma- sonic Order ) During the French Revolution, much hostility was evinced toward re ligion. Many clergymen were sent to the guillotine, churches were de- stroyed, and, moreover, there were those who wanted to eradicate Chris- tianity totally and replace it with a deviant, pagan, symbolic religion called \"the Religion of Reason.\" The leaders of the Revolution also became victims of this madness, every one of them finally losing their heads on the guillotine, to which they themselves had condemned so many people. Even today, many Frenchmen continue to question whether or not the rev- olution was a good thing. The anti-religious sentiments of the French Revolution spread throughout Europe and, as a result, the nineteenth century became one of the boldest and most aggressive periods of anti-religious propaganda. Therefore, this process allowed the possibility for materialist and evolutionist ideas, that had been operating underground for centuries through the use of symbols, to come forth into the public.

Erasmus Darwin was an eighteenth century contemporary of Lamarck. A physicist, psychologist and poet, he was recognized as an au- thority. His biographer, Desmond King-Hele even called him the greatest Englishman of the eighteenth century. 99 But, Erasmus Darwin had a very dark private life. 100 Erasmus Darwin is mainly noted as one of England's most prominent naturalists. As we said at the beginning, naturalism is a view that does not accept that God created living things. Actually, this view, which is close to materialism, was the starting point of Erasmus Darwin's theory of evolu- tion. In the 1780's and 90's, Erasmus Darwin developed the main outlines of theory of evolution, according to which all living things came from a single common ancestor by chance and according to the laws of nature.

Charles Dar- win's theory elaborated upon the structure established by his grandfather, while the Philosophical Society became one of the greatest and most pas- sionate supporters of his theory. 101 In short, Erasmus Darwin was the true pioneer of the theory we know of as the theory of evolution that has been propagandized through- out the world over the past 150 years. Where did Erasmus Darwin discover the idea of evolution? Where did his interest in this subject come from? After a thorough search for the answer to this question, we discover the interesting fact that Erasmus Darwin was a Mason. Though, Erasmus Darwin was no ordinary Mason, he was one of the highest ranking mas- ters in the organization. He was the master of the famous Canongate lodge in Edinburgh, Scotland. 102 Moreover, he had close ties with the Jacobin Masons who were the organizers of the revolution in France at the time, and with the Illumi- nati, whose prime cause was fostering hostility to religion. 103 That is, Eras- mus Darwin was an important name in European Masonic anti-religious organizations.

Although it came some time later, Erasmus Darwin's T emple of Nature was finally revised by Charles Darwin. Darwin's views did not have the weight of a scientific theory; it was merely the expression of a naturalist doctrine that accepts that nature has creative power.

But, the scientists before Darwin's time did not apply the theory of natural selection as an argument against cre- ation; on the contrary, they saw it as a mechanism designed by the Creator to protect the species from a hereditary distortion. Just like Karl Marx took the idealist Hegel's concept of \"dialectics,\" and bent it to fit his own phi- losophy, so did Darwin take the theory of natural selection from creation- ist scientists and used it in a way so as to fit the idea of naturalism. Therefore, Darwin's personal contribution in the formulation of Dar- winism must not be overstated. The philosophical concepts he used were invented by earlier philosophers of naturalism. If Darwin had not pro- posed the theory of evolution, someone else would have. In fact, a theory very similar to his was proposed at the same period by another English natural scientist by the name of Alfred Russell Wallace; it was for this rea- son that Darwin was hasty to publish the Origin of the Species. Finally, Darwin appeared at a stage when the long struggle had begun in Europe to destroy faith in God and religion, replace it with the naturalist philosophy and a humanist model for human life. The most sig- nificant force behind this struggle was not this or that thinker, but the Ma- sonic organization, of which so many thinkers, ideologues and political leaders were members. This fact was recognized and expressed by several Christians of the time. Pope Leo XIII, the leader of the world's Catholics, issued a famous bull in 1884, entitled Humanum Genus in which he made many important DFF THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION REVISITED"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"statements about Masonry and its activities.

Huxley's great dedication to spreading the idea of evolution, together with his establishment connections, is brought into further light according to the following fact: Huxley was a member the Royal Society, of one of England's most prestigious scientific institutions and, like nearly all the other members of this institution, was a senior Mason. 107 Other members of the Royal Society lent Darwin significant support, both before and after the book was published. 108 This Masonic society accepted Darwin and Darwinism to such an extent that, as with the Nobel Prize, Darwin's medal was awarded annually to a scientist deemed worthy of the honor. In short, Darwin wasn't acting alone; from the moment his theory was proposed, he received the support that came from the social classes and groups whose nucleus was made up of Masons. In his book, Marxism and Darwinism , the Marx- ist thinker Anton Pannekoek writes about this important fact and de- scribes the support lent to Darwin by the \"bourgeoisie,\" that is, the wealthy European capitalist class.: That Marxism owes its importance and position only to the role it takes in the proletarian class struggle, is known to all...

In order to test this theory scientifically, it is nec- essary to look at every stage of this supposed process, and to examine whether or not such a process occurred in the past and whether such a process could have been possible. The first step in this process is a hypothetical condition within which lifeless matter could engender a living organism. Before looking at this condition, we must recall a law that has been r ecognized in biology since the time of Pasteur: \"Life comes from life.\" That is, a living organism can be generated only from another living or- ganism. For example, mammals are born from their mothers. In many other species of animals the young are born from eggs that had been laid by the mothers. Plants grow out of seeds. Single-cell organisms such as bacteria divide and multiply. Nothing has ever been observed to the contrary. Throughout the his- tory of the world no one has ever witnessed lifeless matter giving birth to a living being. Of course, there were those in Ancient Egypt, Greece and the Middle Ages who thought they had observed such an outcome; the Egyptians believed that frogs sprang from the mud of the Nile, a belief also sustained by Ancient Greek philosophers, such as Aristotle. In the Middle Ages it was believed that mice were begotten from the wheat of"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"granaries. However, all these beliefs proved to be out of ignorance, and fi- nally, in his famous experiments in the 1860's, Pasteur proved that even bacteria, the most basic form of life, did not come to be without a prede- cessor, that is, it is not possible for lifeless things to produce life. But, the theory of evolution is dependent on this impossibility be- cause it claims that living things were born and developed without the in- volvement of a creator, and this requires that, at the first stage of this proposed scenario, living things be generated by chance. Darwin attempted to describe the origins of life, about which he knew little, in a short sentence, wherein he stated that life must have first appeared \"some warm little pond,\" 111 but evolutionists that followed him became concerned about elaborating on this matter. However, efforts made through- out the twentieth cen- tury to produce an evolutionist explana- tion of the origins of life r esulted only in deep- ening the impasse in which evolutionists had found themselves.

This is because the structure of the most basic single-celled living organ- ism is highly complex. It is mathematically impossible that even a cell's basic constituents—proteins, DNA or RNA—could have come to be by chance, much less the cell itself. The fact that the probability of life generating by chance is impossible alone proves the existence of a design, and this, in turn, proves the fact of creation. On this matter, the famous English astronomer and mathemati- cian, Fred Hoyle, makes this comment: Indeed, such a theory (that life was assembled by an intelligence) is so ob- vious that one wonders why it is not widely accepted as being self-evident. The reasons are psychological rather than scientific. 11 2 This \"psychological reason\" that Hoyle mentions is the evolutionists' disposition by which they insist on rejecting, in advance, every result that should lead them to accept the existence of God and their conditioning themselves for this. In our other works focusing on the invalidity of the theory of evolu- tion, we cited many admissions of this fact by the evolutionists and we ex- amined the irrational hypotheses that evolutionists have blindly proposed merely in order to not accept the existence of God. At this point though, we will focus our attention on the Masonic lodges to see their view on this matter. While it is so clearly evident that \"life was brought into being by an intelligent Creator,\" what do the Masons think about the question? Master Mason, Selami Isindag, in his book intended for Mason audi- ence, entitled Evrim Yolu (The Way of Evolution), explains the matter in this way: The most important characteristic of our school of morality is that we do not depart from the principles of logic and we do not enter the unknowns of the- ism, secret meanings or dogmas. On this basis we assert that the first ap-"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"pearance of life began in crystals under conditions that we cannot know or discover today. Living things were born according to the law of evolution and slowly spread over the earth. As a result of evolution, today's human be- ings came to be and advanced beyond other animals both in consciousness and intelligence. 11 3 It is important to notice the connection between cause and effect sug- gested in the above quotation: Isindag stresses that the most important characteristic of Masonry is that it rejects theism, that is, belief in God. And immediately afterwards, he claims \"on this basis\" that life arose spon- taneously from lifeless matter, and later underwent evolution that re- sulted in the appearance of human beings. It will be noticed that Isindag brings no scientific evidence to bear on the theory of evolution. (The fact that there is no scientific evidence is pre- supposed by the obtuse words these are facts \"that we cannot know or dis- cover today\"). The only support that Isindag supplies for the theory of evolution is the Masonic non-acceptance of theism. In other words, Masons are evolutionists because they do not accept the existence of God. This is the only reason for their being evolutionists. In the constitution of the \"Great Council of Turkey\" organized by T urkish Masons of the 33rd degree, the evolution scenario was once again r estated, and the Masons' rejection of the creationist explanation ex- pressed in these words: In a very early age and according to an inorganic process, organic life came to be. In order to produce cellular organisms cells came together in groups. Later, intelligence sprang forth and human beings were born. But from where? We keep asking ourselves this question. Was it from God's breathing over formless mud? We reject the explanation of an abnormal kind of cre- ation; a kind of creation that excludes man .

When the writer says that they \"reject a kind of creation that excludes man,\" he is repeating the basic dogma of humanism, that \"a human being is the highest creature that exists,\" and announcing that Masons reject any other explanation. When he says, \"an abnormal kind of creation,\" he means God's interven- tion in the creation of living beings, rejecting thi s possibility a priori . (How- ever, what is truly abnormal is that Masons accept, without observation or experiment, the illogical belief that lifeless matter came to life by chance and formed life on earth, including human beings.) It will be noticed that ac- cording to the Masonic explanation there is no suggestion of scientific proof. Masons do not say, \"There is proof for evolution and therefore we reject cre- ation.\" They are only blinded by a philosophical fanaticism. Masonic publications insist on this tenet. Master Mason Selami Isindag claims that \" apart from nature there is no force that guides us, and is responsible for our thoughts and actions .\" He immediately adds, \" life began from one cell and reached its present stage as a result of var- ious changes and evolutions .\" 11 5 Later he summarizes what the theory of evolution means for Masons: From the point of view of evolution, human beings are no different from an- imals. For the formation of man and his evolution there are no special forces other than those to which animals are subjected. 11 6 This assertion shows clearly why Masons attach such importance to the theory of evolution. Their aim is to defend the idea that human beings were not created and to present their own humanist materialist philoso- phy as tenable. And, the only method that can be used to reject the idea that human beings were created is the theory of evolution."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DGG T T H H E E M M A A S S O O N N S S ' ' F F A A L L S S E E S S U U P P P P O O R R T T O O F F H H A A E E C C K K E E L L When we look at Masonic literature, apart from their blind attachment to the theory of evolution, we are struck by its profound ignorance. For example, when we examine Turkish sources, we see that evolutionist claims that were proved false in the first quarter of the twentieth century are still defended passionately. One of these is the story of Haeckel and his theory on embryos mentioned nearly in all Ma- sonic publications. The story is about a German biologist by the name of Ernst Haeckel, who was a close friend and supporter of Charles Darwin, and one of the most prominent sup- porters of the theory after Darwin's death. In order to establish the validity of the theory, Haeckel examined the embryos of various living things, and proposed that they all resembled one another and that each undergoes a miniature process of evo- lution before birth. To support this claim, he drew a number of comparisons be- tween different embryos, by means of which he persuaded many of the validity of the theory of evolution in the first half of the twentieth century. As we mentioned, Masonic sources place great importance on this embryol- ogy thesis, which is termed \"'ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Master Naki Cevad Akkerman, in an article entitled \"The Concept of Truth and the Principles of Masonry\" in Mimar Sinan , calls this thesis a \"law,\" that is, he raises it to the rank of undisputable scientific fact. He writes: ...We will consider a very important natural law. This is the formula proposed by Haeckel, \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" If we take a human being as an example, the meaning of the law is as follows: The morphological changes and changes in the order and func- tion of the organs that a human being undergoes, from the first cellular formation in his mother's womb, until he is born and during his life until he dies, is nothing more than a recapitulation of the changes that he has undergone since the beginning, from his initial cellular formation in earth and in water until today. 1 Master Mason Selami Isindag also places great importance on Haeckel's the- ory. In an article entitled \"Masonic Doctrines\" he writes \"In his experiments, Darwin proved that various species of animals first developed from a single cell and later from a single species.\" Then he adds: Haeckel made studies supporting all these experimental findings. He believed that the most basic animal, the Monera, became an organic living thing from inorganic material elements. He demonstrated that there was a unity at the basis of everything. This Monism is a combination of matter and spirit. These are two aspects of the substance that forms their basis. What Masonry believes is in conformity with these scientific and experimental findings. 2 In another Masonic text Haeckel is referred to as a \"great scholar,\" and his the- sis that \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\" is claimed as proof of the theory of evo- lution. 3"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"DGH THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION REVISITED However, the Ernst Haeckel that Masons be- lieve to be a great scholar was an imposter who de- liberately falsified scientific discoveries, and the thesis they accept as a \"law\" (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) is one of the greatest deceits in the his- tory of science. This deceit is found in the drawings of embryos made by Haeckel. In order to demonstrate the simi- larity between the embryos of human beings, chick- ens, rabbits, salamanders, which in reality shared no such resemblance to each other, he falsified the draw- ings. In some cases, he took the organs out of the em- bryos, in other cases he added organs. Moreover, he altered the actual size of the embryos in an attempt to show them as all the same size. In short, Haeckel conducted this falsification in order to fabricate evidence where there otherwise was none. The reputable science journal by the name of Science contained an article in its September 5 1997 edition that stated: \"In reality...even closely related embryos such as those of fish vary quite a bit in their appearance and developmental pathway...It (Haeckel's draw- ings) looks like it's turning out to be one of the most famous fakes in biology.\" 4 Interestingly, this deception has long been recognized for many years. Haeckel's drawings were shown to be falsifications already in his own lifetime (1910), with he himself admitted to it. In an article published in American Scientist we read: \"Surely the biogenetic law is as dead as a doornail... As a topic of serious theoretical inquiry it was extinct in the twenties...\" 5 In spite of this, evolutionists continued to use these drawings for decades with the sole intention of deceiving the masses who had no knowledge of the topic. There is only one reason why Masons regard Haeckel's theory as a proof for the theory of evolution, and think of him as a great scholar: The Masons' dedication to the theory of evolution is not based on their passion for knowledge and truth, as they claim, but, on the contrary, out of ignorance. 1 Naki Cevad Akkerman, Mimar Sinan , No. 1, p.13 2 Selami Isindag, Masonluk Ö¤retileri, Masonluktan Esinlenmeler (Inspirations from Freemasonry) , Istanbul, p.137 3 Selami Isindag, Din Aç›s›ndan Mason Ö¤retisi (Masonic Doctrine According to Religion) , Akasya Tekamül Mahfili Publications, p.10 4 Elizabeth Pennisi, \"Haeckel's Embryos: Fraud Rediscovered,\" Science, September 5, 1997 5 Keith S.

A dogmatic person does not investigate or reconsider something he believes in whether or not there is any proof for it. He accepts it totally and sticks to it adamantly. Masons and other anti-religious groups regularly use the term \"dog- matic\" to refer to those who believe in God. We encounter this accusation frequently today. For example, in a debate about the theory of evolution, the evolutionist side will probably accuse those who do not accept the the- ory as dogmatic, and declare themselves scientific by maintaining that sci- ence has no interest in \"dogmas.\" However, this accusation is false. Belief in the existence of God, and that He created all beings, is a belief that is supported by much rational and scientific evidence. There is balance, order and design in nature, and it is clear that this was established intelligently and with deliberate purpose. It is for this reason that the Qur'an calls human beings to discover the signs of God, and invites them to consider this balance, order and design, and in many verses commands them to think about the proofs in the heav- ens and on earth of the existence of God. Those proofs pointed out in the Qur'an are such phenomena as, not only the balance and order in the uni- verse, but the suitability of the world to human life, the design of plants and animals, the design of the human body, and the spiritual qualities of human beings, all of which has been substantiated by modern science."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"(For details, see Harun Yahya's A llah is Known Through Reason, The Cre- ation of the Universe, Darwinism Refuted, For Men of Understanding, Design in Nature ) Rather, dogmatism is a quality of those who refuse to consider these things, and reject God while continuing to defend the view that the uni- verse exists by its own accord and that living things came to be by chance. Masons are a true example of such an outlook. Despite the fact that the proofs for God's existence are evident, they prefer to ignore and reject them in favor of the humanist and materialist philosophy. In the Qur'an, God refers to of those of such a mentality: Do you not see that God has subjected to you everything in the heavens and earth and has showered His blessings upon you, both outwardly and inwardly? Yet there are people who argue about God without knowledge or guidance or any illuminating Book. When they are told: \"Follow what God has sent down,\" they say, \"No, we will follow what we found our fathers doing.\" What! Even if Satan is calling them to the punishment of the Blazing Fire? (Qur'an, 31: 20-21) These verses show that the godless, despite the fact that they see the proofs for God, \"argue about God,\" that is, they engage in a war against His r eligion. The reason for this is that these godless people follow what they found their fathers doing, that is, they are mired in a blind traditionalism . Evidently, traditionalism defines very well the history and philosophy of Masonry as we have been examining it from the beginning of this book. Indeed, traditionalism is a word that describes Masonry very well because Masonry is nothing other than an \"organization of traditions,\" whose roots go back thousands of years to earlier pagan societies. It blindly follows the traditions of Ancient Egypt, of the pharaohs and their magicians, Ancient Greek materialist philosophers, Hermeticists, Kabbal- ists, Templars, Rosicrucians and of Masons before them.

In modern Masonic lodges, legends, symbols and words that are thousands of years old, are still used.

If a person who knows nothing about Masonry is brought into one of their lodges, he will probably think that he is visiting a comedy film-set, and perhaps not be able to stop himself from laughing when he sees Masons in the course of the initiation ceremony, with their eyes blindfolded, ropes around their necks, and walking around with one bare foot. But, Masons, living in their secret world, regard these strange ceremonies as very normal, and find psychological satisfaction in the mystical atmosphere of their lodges. After these ceremonies, they sit and talk with one another about their beliefs that \"atoms have spirits and come together to form living things,\" that \"the world attained its balance because of the hidden intelligence in magma,\" or that Mother Nature has created us very well\" and other myths.

An article entitled \"Politics and Freemasonry,\" that appeared in Mimar Sinan , maintains the following about the struggle against religion: Along with not being a political party, Freemasonry became organized in the beginning of the eighteenth century into a social institution of international scope in tune with political and social currents. In order to help sects in their attempt to exercise religious freedom, Freemasonry engaged in a struggle against the power and influence of the clergy in the attempt to achieve their sole aim of toppling the Church's power and influence over the peo- ple . For this reason, in 1738 and 1751 it was declared godless by the Pope... In those countries that adopted the principles of religious freedom, Freema- sonry was a mysterious and secret society only in name; in these countries it was both ignored and encouraged, found members among the middle class and high officials who had time and means, and installed leading state offi- cials in positions of leadership in its own organizations. In southern coun- tries where everyone had to be a Catholic, they maintained their character as a secret, forbidden, revolutionary organization subject to legal surveil- lance . In these countries free-thinking young people, and officers discontent with government administration, began to enter Masonic lodges and so rev- olutionary plans were initiated and directed against those regimes of Spain, Portugal and Italy that were under the domination of the Vati- can . 120 There is no doubt that here the Masonic writer is using language fa- voring his own organization when he states that Masonry is fighting a war against church domination. But, when we examine the matter more closely, we see that in many countries, that same \"domination\" was conve- nient for regimes founded or supported by Masons. Therefore, we may easily recognize that Masonry's claim to be fighting against \"domination\""},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"DHJ THE MASONIC WAR AGAINST RELIGION is pretense. Despite the fact that the Church—because Christianity had become distorted—preserved scholastic ideas and oppressive practices, Masonry's hostility toward the Church was not founded on this but from its hatred of traditional monotheist religions. It suffices to look at the structure of Masonry and its rites and cere- monies to come to an understanding of this matter.

One such society was the \"Hell-Fire Club,\" that was active in England in the middle of the eighteenth century. The Masonic structure of this club and its anti-religious, pagan character, is described by the Ma- sonic writer Daniel Willens in his article, \"The Hell-Fire Club: Sex, Politics and Religion in Eighteenth-Century in England.\" Here are some interest- ing passages from that article published in Gnosis , a journal of Western inner traditions: On moonlit nights during the reign of England's King George III, immensely powerful members of His Majesty's Government, important intellectuals, and influential artists could sometimes be seen travelling up the Thames River by gondola to a ruined abbey near West Wycombe. There, to the sonorous tolling of the deconsecrated cloister's bell, they dressed in monk- ish robes and indulged in every manner of depravity, culminating in a Black Mass celebrated on the naked body of a debauched noblewoman and presided over by that notorious rake Sir Francis Dashwood. Their diabolical devotions concluded, the inner circle would adjourn to plot the course of the British Empire.

Wharton was a prominent Whig politician, Freemason, and atheist who sought to ridicule religion by publicly presiding over festive gatherings with \"Sa- tanic\" trappings... and Wharton went on to become Grand Master Mason of the London Grand Lodge in 1722... By 1739, Dashwood was on the homeward leg of his journey. On his way, he stopped in Florence to see the Abbe Nicolini, and it was there that he met Lady Mary Wortley Montagu... [who] would eventually join... Dashwood in the Divan Club. ...Unfortunately things were not going well for Freema- sonry in Italy. Pope Clement XII had recently issued the bull In Eminenti Apostalatus Specula , unleashing the Inquisition against the lodges. By early 1740, the pontiff was dead, and Dashwood went to Rome for the conclave that would elect the new pope. There he playfully assumed the identity of Cardinal Ottiboni, one of the chief persecutors of the Masons, and lam- pooned him publicly in a scurrilous mock ritual.... The \"chapter-room\" is the key to understanding the Monks' activities. Its furnishings remain unknown, and consequently the use to which it was put re mains a mystery. Sensationalist authors assume it was a Satanic sanctuary, although it seems more reasonable to conclude that it was used for Ma- sonic ceremonies.

Sir Robert Walpole's son Horace, one of Dashwood's politi- cal enemies and certainly a stranger to the abbey, mocked: \"Whatever their doctrines were, their practice was rigorously pagan: Bacchus and Venus were the deities to whom they almost publicly sacrificed; and the nymphs and the hogsheads that were laid in against the festivals of this new church, sufficiently informed the neighbourhood of the complexion of those hermits.\" ... The membership roll of the Medmenham Monks no longer exists, if it ever did, but the names most reliably associated with the group include Dash- wood's brother, John Dashwood-King; John Montagu, Earl of Sandwich; John Wilkes; George Bubb Dodington, Baron Melcombe; Paul Whitehead; and a collection of the local lesser gentry and professional men. ... a group of men sufficiently in the public eye to create scandal. The whole question of religion is central to the fascination that Dashwood continues to exercise. ...A more sophisticated interpretation might seize upon the rumours of sexual magic, the abbey's kabbalistic book, the recur- ring image of Harpocrates, Dashwood's tenuous connection with the Ma- sonic Order of the Temple, and of course the Thelemic motto on Medmenham Abbey to conclude that the Hell-Fire Club was an early mani- festation of \"Crowleyanity.\" A more sober-minded approach would pick out Dashwood's Masonic contacts and conclude, probably correctly, that the \"chapter-room\" was a Masonic temple . 121 The reason for including this lengthy quotation is to get an idea of the atmosphere in which eighteenth century Masonry developed and of the influence it had on people. Masonry appeared as a secret, and curiously at- tractive organization, whose opposition to the general beliefs of society"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"provided a kind of psychological satisfaction to its members. The basic characteristic of Masonic rites, as stressed in the above quotation, was the sanctification of pagan symbols and concepts instead of those of tradi- tional monotheistic religions. So, those who became Masons, and turned their back on Christianity, became paganized, though not necessarily by adopting paganism as a belief, but at least through the adoption of its symbols. However, Masonry was not content just to practice strange cere- monies; it also followed a strategy designed to alienate Europe from the divine religions, and lure it into paganism. In the following section we will consider some high-points of European history, country by country, and follow the traces of this Masonic war against religion. The first country we must examine is France. T T H H E E S S T T R R U U G G G G L L E E A A G G A A I I N N S S T T R R E E L L I I G G I I O O N N I I N N F F R R A A N N C C E E In earlier works we have examined the important role played by Ma- sonry in the French Revolution. A very large number of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, especially those with the strongest anti-religious views, were Masons. The Jacobins, who set the stage for the revolution, and became its leaders, were lodge members. 122 The role played by Masons in the revolution was admitted by an \"agent-provocateur\" by the name of Count Cagliostro . Cagliostro was ar- r ested by the Inquisition in 1789, and made some important admissions while under interrogation. He began by stating that Masons throughout Europe had been planning a chain of revolutions. He said that the main goal of the Masons was to destroy the Papacy or to take it over. In his con- fession, Cagliostro also admitted that Jewish bankers financially sup- ported all these revolutionary activities, and that Jewish money also played an important role in the French Revolution. 123 The French Revolution was basically a revolution against religion. In DID THE MASONIC WAR AGAINST RELIGION"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"the determined effort of the revolutionaries to get rid of the clergy, as well as the aristocracy, many clergymen were killed, religious institutions de- stroyed, and places of worship ruined. The Jacobins wanted even to de- stroy Christianity completely, and replace it with a pagan belief they called \"religioun of reason.\" But, within a short time, they lost control of the revolution and France was thrown into total chaos. Masonry's mission in that country did not stop with the revolution. The chaos that came as a result of the revolution was finally settled when Napoleon came to power. But, this stability did not last long; Napoleon's ambition to rule the whole of Europe only brought an end to his power. Afterwards, the conflict in France continued between the monarchists and the revolutionists. In 1830, 1848 and 1871, three more revolutions oc- curred. In 1848, the \"Second Republic\" was founded; in 1871 the \"Third Re- public\" was established. Masons were very active throughout this period of agitation. Their primary aim was to weaken the Church and its religious institutions, de- stroy the values of religion and the influence of its laws on society, and to abolish religious education. Masons regarded \"anti-clericalism\" as the center of their social and political activities. The Catholic Encyclopedia provides important information about the anti-religious mission of the Grand Orient, as French Masonry was known: From the official documents of French Masonry contained principally in the official \"Bulletin\" and \"Compte-rendu\" of the Grand Orient it has been proved that all the anti-clerical measures passed in the French Parliament were decreed beforehand in the Masonic lodges and executed under the direction of the Grand Orient , whose avowed aim is to control everything and everybody in France. \"I said in the assembly of 1898,\" states the deputy Massé, the official orator of the Assembly of 1903, \"that it is the supreme duty of Freemasonry to interfere each day more and more in political and profane struggles.\" \" Success (in the anti-clerical combat) is in a large mea- GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DIE"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"sure due to Freemasonry ; for it is its spirit, its programme, its methods, that have triumphed.\" \" If the Bloc has been established, this is owing to Freemasonry and to the discipline learned in the lodges \"...\"We need vigi- lance and above all mutual confidence, if we are to accomplish our work, as yet unfinished. This work, you know . . . the anti-clerical combat, is going on. The Republic must rid itself of the religious congregations, sweeping them off by a vigorous stroke. The system of half measures is everywhere danger- ous; the adversary must be crushed with a single blow.\" 124 The Catholic Encyclopedia continues its account of French Masonry's struggle against religion: In truth all the \"anti-clerical\" Masonic reforms carried out in France since 1877, such as the secularization of education, measures against private Christian schools and charitable establishments, the suppression of the reli- gious orders and the spoliation of the Church, professedly culminate in an anti-Christian and irreligious reorganization of human society, not only in France but throughout the world . Thus French Freemasonry, as the stan- dard-bearer of all Freemasonry, pretends to inaugurate the golden era of the Masonic universal republic, comprising in Masonic brotherhood all men and all nations. \"The triumph of the Galilean,\" said the president of the Grand Orient, Senator Delpech, on 20 September, 1902, \"has lasted twenty cen- turies. But now he dies in his turn.... The Romish Church, founded on the Galilean myth, began to decay rapidly from the very day on which the Ma- sonic Association was established\" 125 By the \"Galilean\" the Masons mean Jesus, because according to the Gospel, Jesus was born in the Palestinian town of Galilee. Therefore, the Masons' hatred for the Church is an expression of their hatred for Jesus and all monotheistic religions. They thought that they had destroyed the effect of the divine religions with the materialist, Darwinist and humanist philosophies they established in the nineteenth century, and returned Eu- r ope to its pre-Christian paganism.

Many of the clergy were arrested, some were exiled and reli- gious persons began to be regarded as second-class citizens. For this rea- son, in 1904, the Vatican broke all diplomatic relations with France but this did not change the country's attitude. It took the loss of the lives of hun- dreds of thousands of French men against the German army in the First W orld War before the country's arrogance was tamed and it again recog- nized the importance of spiritual values. As The Catholic Encyclopedia maintains, the war against religion, from the French Revolution to the twentieth century, was carried out by \"the anti-clerical measures passed in the French Parliament\" which \"were de- creed beforehand in the Masonic lodges and executed under the direction of the Grand Orient.\" 126 This fact is clear from Masonic writings. For ex- ample, a quotation from a Turkish publication of \"A Speech Made by Brother Gambetta on July 8 1875 in the Clémente Amitié Lodge\" reads: While the specter of reaction threatened France, and religious doctrine and backward ideas went on the offensive against modern social principles and laws, in the bosom of industrious, far-sighted organizations like Masonry devoted to the principles of brotherhood, we find the strength and consola- tion in the struggle against the extravagant claims of the Church, its ridicu- lous exaggerations and habitual excesses...we must be on guard and continue in the struggle. In order to establish the ideas of human order and progress, let us endure so that our shields cannot be broken through. 127 It will be noticed that Masonic literature consistently presents its own ideas as \"far-sighted\" while accusing religious people of being \"back- ward.\" However, this is merely a play on words. The notion of \"the specter of reaction,\" mentioned in the above quotation, is something that sincere r eligious people also oppose, but which Masons exploit to take aim at true"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"r eligion in their attempt to alienate people from it. Moreover, it must again be emphasized that the materialist-humanist philosophy espoused by Masons is really a superstitious, backward system of ideas, a hold-over of the pagan civilizations of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Therefore, the Masons' use of terms like \"far-sightedness\" and \"back- wardness\" has no basis in reality. Indeed, it is unfounded because the con- flict between Masons and religious people is nothing more than the perpetuation of the conflict between two ideas that have existed since the earliest ages of history. It is religion that proclaims the first of these ideas: that humanity was created by the will of God and that human beings are r esponsible to worship Him. This is the truth. The opposing idea, that human beings were not created but live vain and purposeless lives, is the one proposed by those who deny the existence of God. When correctly un- derstood, it can be seen that their use of the superficial terms of \"back- wardness\" and \"far-sightedness\" has no basis. By making use of the idea of \"progress,\" Masons seek to destroy reli- gion. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" states: The following are deemed the principal means [of freemasonry]: (1) To destroy radically by open persecution of the Church or by a hypocrit- ical fraudulent system of separation between State and Church, all social in- fluence of the Church and of religion , insidiously called \"clericalism,\" and, as far as possible, to destroy the Church and all true, i.e., superhuman reli- gion, which is more than a vague cult of fatherland and of humanity ; (2) To laicize, or secularize, by a likewise hypocritical fraudulent system of \"unsectarianism,\" all public and private life and, above all, popular instruc- tion and education. \"Unsectarianism\" as understood by the Grand Orient party is anti-Catholic and even anti-Christian, atheistic, positivistic, or ag- nostic sectarianism in the garb of unsectarianism.

The Grand Orient party considers it indispensable and an infallibly sure way to the final es- tablishment of the universal social republic... 128 It can be seen that Masonry has put a program into effect, under the name of \"the liberation of society,\" whose purpose is to eradicate religion, a program that is still being implemented. This must not be confused with a model that seeks to provide the opportunity for every citizen of what- ever religious faith to practice his faith freely. Rather, the model envi- sioned by Masonry is one of mass brainwashing, designed to remove r eligion completely from society and the minds of individuals and, if nec- essary, to persecute its adherents. In every country where it is established, Masonry seeks to put this program into effect, though in a way that conforms to the culture and con- ditions prevalent in that country. One such country is Germany.

The present territory called Germany was ruled by a number of principalities. The largest of these was Prussia, which occupied the eastern part of today's Germany and a large part of Poland. In the 1860's, Prussia began to annex other small German states and founded the German Empire in 1871. The r uler of this new state was the Prussian Prime Minister and Chancellor of the new German Empire, Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck was a successful statesman, especially in foreign politics, but did not enjoy the same success in domestic affairs. One of the reasons for this was a group of intellectuals known as the \"National Liberals,\" sim- ilar to the French anti-clerics, that adopted an anti-religious policy.

Encouraged by the National Liberals, Bismarck embarked on an anti-Catholic campaign known as the Kulturkampf , or \"culture war.\" It was also described as a struggle to control the minds of Germans . 129 During the Kulturkampf , Catholics, especially in the southern Ger- Otto von Bismarck"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"many, suffered oppression. In 1872, in compliance with a law that had been passed, all Jesuit priests in the country were rounded up in a single night and their institu- tions confiscated. In compliance with the \"May laws,\" ( maigesetze ) passed in 1873, all priests working for the government were fired, the Church was forbidden involvement in all matters related to marriages and educa- tion, and topics of sermons was restricted. A number of archbishops were arrested and 1300 churches were eventually found without a priest. But, because these tactics produced a strong reaction among the Catholics of the country against the government, the Kulturkampf was re- laxed. Bismarck ignored the suggestions of the National Liberals, who had led him into this campaign, and restrained the Kulturkampf little by little until he finally cancelled it completely. This whole campaign re- sulted in nothing other than the oppression of faithful German Catholics, and the ruin of the country's sense of social well-being. Many historians today believe that it was a fiasco that shattered Germany's sense of social security. Moreover, after Germany, the wave of this Kulturkampf encom- passed Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Holland, causing a great social tension in these countries. The interesting thing to note that it was the Mason intellectuals who lured Bismarck into this policy. The Catholic Encyclopedia says : But they (Masons) certainly furthered the movement by which Prussia gradu- ally became the leading state of Germany, considered by them as the \"repre- sentative and the protector of modern evolution\" against \"Ultramontanism,\" \"bigotry,\" and \"Papal usurpations.\" They also instigated the \" Kulturkampf . \" The celebrated jurisconsult and Mason, Grandmaster Bluntschli, was one of the foremost agitators in this conflict; he also stirred up the Swiss \" Kul- turkampf \"...

The American commentator Elbridge Colby explains that \"the Nazis opened a new Kulturkampf against the Catholic Church, jailing priests and deposing bishops; unlike 1874, however, Hitler also moved against the established Protestant.\" 131 In short, the activities initiated by Masons to alienate society from re- ligion gave rise to one of history's most brutal dictatorships, the Nazi \"Reich,\" and drew the world into the World War Two in which 55 million persons lost their lives.

Until 1870, the Italian territory was occupied by several small states, re mnants from feudal times. The most important of these was the Papal State. It was centered in Rome, ruled by the Pope, and controlled a large part of central Italy. The Masons in Italy were founded as an extension of the French Masons, and began to exercise an influence in Italy from the be- ginning of the nineteenth century. They wanted to destroy the Papal State and eradicate the authority of the Church in Italy as a whole. According to the author of the book entitled The Roman Catholic Church and the Craft, master Freemason Alec Mellor: \"In Italy, the origin of irregular lodges was mainly political; they confused Masonry with the fight against the temporal power of the Pope.\" 132 Masonry began its struggle against religion in Italy by means of an- other secret society that it founded and controlled. This society was known as the \" Carbonari .\" This society, first heard of in Naples at the beginning of the nine- teenth century, took its name from charcoal burners. As the Masons used the emblem of the wall-builder and expressed their ideas with symbols, so the Carbonari adopted the emblem of the charcoal burner. But, the society GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DJE"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"DJF THE MASONIC WAR AGAINST RELIGION had ulterior objectives. The mem- bers of the society sought to initi- ate a political program, first in Italy, and then in France, to de- stroy the influence of the Church, establish a new government and secularize all social institutions. The connection between Masonry and the Carbonari is ev- ident. Masons automatically be- came members of Carbonari societies; in fact, from the mo- ment they entered the society they gained the degree of Master. (On the other hand, it was neces- sary for other Carbonari mem- bers to undergo a long process of advancement before achieving this degree) Two cardinals by the names of Consalvi and Pacca issued an edict on August 15, 1814 accusing the Masons and the Carbonari of being orga- nized for socio-political interference and the fomentation of hostility to- ward religion. This accusation proved to be true for members of the Carbonari had organized political ruses and armed uprisings. The armed uprising that took place in Macerata on June 25, 1817 was organized by the Carbonari, but it was suppressed by security forces of the Papal State. In 1820, in Spain and Naples, and in 1821 in Piedmont, revolutionary uprisings were organized by the Carbonari against the Church and public order. It is an accepted fact that the Carbonari were founded by the Masons who engaged in parallel revolutionary activities with them.

In Italy, it united with the \"Young Italy\" movement founded by Guiseppe Mazzini. Mazzini, a known atheist, had struggled for years against the Papal State and the Church and finally became a high-ranking Mason who would become founder of the Italian Union. With the support of two other prominent Masons, Guiseppe Garibaldi and Count di Cavour, he founded the Italian Union in 1870, and drew the boundaries of the Papal State within its present borders. Afterwards, Italy entered a process by which it became increasingly distanced from religion, and that was to prepare the foundation for Mussolini's fascist dictatorship in the 1920's. In short, we can say that Mazzini, Garibaldi and Cavour were three prominent leaders who performed important functions in the struggle against religion in Europe. Mazzini was not only a political leader in the struggle against religion, he also played a role as an ideologue. His slogan \"every nation a state\" was the spark that ignited minority rebellions, which were to be the cause of the fall of multi-ethnic empires, such as the GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DJG Giuseppe Mazzini and Count di Cavour: two Master Masons who brought the Papal State to an end."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"DJH THE MASONIC WAR AGAINST RELIGION Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman Empires.

The fact that this call came from Masons, indeed, high-ranking Ma- sons, is certainly significant. According to information from the lodge publication 10,000 Famous Freemasons , Mazzini rose within the Masonic lodge, and years later, in 1867, was chosen Master Mason of the Italian Grand Orient. In 1949, at a ceremony in Rome to mark the unveiling of a statue of Mazzini, 3,000 Masons gratefully remembered their Grand Mas- ter.

The Catholic Encyclo- pedia states: \"In...the later revolutionary movements in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Central and South America, Masonic bodies, it is claimed, took a more or less active part... In Russia also Freemasonry fi- nally turned out to be a 'political conspiracy' of Masonically organized clubs that covered the land.\" 133 The Masonic plot in Russia is especially interesting. Masonry came to this country in the second half of the eighteenth century and was widespread among intellectuals. Although it appeared externally as merely a cultural club, anti-religious and anti-government ideas from other parts of Europe were discussed in these lodges. The first to take notice were the priests of the Orthodox Church. The priests sent the information they had obtained to Tsar Alexander I, whose relationship with the Church was good, telling of a Masonic plot to topple the Tsar's r egime. In response, the Tsar issued a law in 1822 to shut down all the Ma- sonic lodges in the country and outlaw the organization. Nevertheless, this failed to eliminate the Masons; they merely went underground. Three years after Tsar Alexander I outlawed the lodges, he became ill and passed away. He was succeeded by Tsar Nicholas I. But, Tsar Nicholas' succession came as a result of a series of disputes and intrigues and gave rise to a chaotic situation in the country. Certain individuals who had wanted to bring stability to the situation by toppling the regime had planned a coup against the new Tsar. They had many supporters in the army. Confident in this support, a number of revolutionary soldiers, to- gether with a number of civilians, marched into the Tsar's palace, in the capital of St.Petersburg, on the 14th of December 1825. There was an armed encounter between the revolutionaries and the forces of the Tsar in which the revolutionaries were defeated.

In the 1917 February Revolution, the leader, Alexander Kerensky, and nearly all his close sup- porters were all Masons. 135 And the majority of the new government was composed of Masons. 136 The only contribution to history that the short- lived Kerensky Government made was to deliver the country into the hands of Lenin and the Bolsheviks he led.

Masonry wanted to establish a new order in which religious institu- tions and religious faith are eradicated, and to this end has attempted to topple monarchies that were supportive of religion. In many European countries, Masonic lodges became rallying centers for opponents of reli- gion, where coups, uprisings, assasinations, political plots and anti-reli- gious politics were conspired. Behind all such activities, whether on a small or grand scale, which have occurred since the French Revolution in 1789 to the twentieth century, is found the influence of Masonry. According to the English historian Michael Howard, Masonic lodges concentrated their efforts in the second half of the nineteenth century to overthrow the two remaining important Empires: the Austro-Hungarian and the Russian Empires, and were able to achieve their goal as a result of the World War One.

Their dream is of a world in which humanity is idolized, where people have completely rejected true religion, and the evolutionist philoso- phy is regarded as the only true philosophy. In a Masonic text, a strange ceremony organized for this intention is described: T oday, one universal religion is coming into being, slowly as it may be, that can sat- isfy consciousness in its full meaning... Parallel to this universal religion a morality will be established commensurate with a world-view... Such a religion will unite human beings in the universe. This is MASONRY. This religion will be passed from heart to heart. The temples of this religion will be temples of humanity. Among the hymns sung in this temple may be Beethoven's 9th Symphony, the most noble musi- cal composition that ever sprang from the human spirit.... Instead of the meat and blood of a bull in the ceremonies of Mithras, we celebrate this birth by eating bread and drinking red wine. Here we unite in a common faith that has the character of a communion. In a new year, I want to baptize this holy struggle of ours and bring it to an end: Eat one more piece of bread, brothers, you are the mis- sionaries of this religion, let those saints who share this bread be friends. Brothers, to be blood brothers, take another sip of flame from your wine glass.

Therefore, the twentieth century was not one of Masonic revolutions. Thinking they have no more obstacles to confront, Masons prefer to merely disseminate their philosophy instead of hatching political plots. They spread their materialist and humanist philosophy to the masses under the guise of science, or by means of art, the media, literature, music and all manner of popular culture. Masons do not intend by this propa- ganda to eradicate the divine religions in a sudden revolution; they want to achieve this over the long-term, and to initiate all people into their phi- losophy only little by little. An American Mason sums up this method as follows: Freemasonry does its work silently, but it is the work of a deep river, that silently pushes on towards the ocean. 137 High Priest J.W. Taylor, from the state of Georgia in the USA, makes this interesting comment on the same matter: The abandonment of old themes and the formation of new ones do not al- ways arise from the immediately perceptible cause which the world assigns, but are the culmination of principles which have been working in the minds of men for many years , until at last the proper time and propitious surroundings kindle the latent truth into life... enthusing all with a mighty common cause and moving nations as one man to the accomplishment of great ends. On this principle does the Institution of Freemasonry diffuse its influence to the world of mankind. It works quietly and secretly, but pene- trates through all the interstices of society in its many relations, and the re- cipients of its many favors are awed by its grand achievements, but cannot tell whence it came. 138 According to V oice magazine, published by the Grand Lodge in Chicago, \"So, silently but surely and continually, it [Masonry] builds into the great fabric of human society\" 139 This \"building into the great"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"DKF THE MASONIC WAR AGAINST RELIGION fabric\" will come about when the basics of Masonic philosophy—materi- alism, humanism and Darwinism—are imposed on society. The most interesting aspect of this silent and remote strategy is that those Masons who are carrying it out almost never reveal that it is being done in the name of Masonry. They do their work under different identi- ties, titles and in different positions of power, but they impose a com- monly espoused philosophy they adopted through Masonry, on society. One of Turkish Masonry's Master Masons, Halil Mulkus, explained this matter in an interview a few years ago: Masonry as Masonry does not do anything. Masonry guides individuals and individuals who are trained here, and Masons who contribute to the produc- tion of intellectual development are at various levels in their careers in the places where they live in the world. They are rectors of universities, profes- sors, ministers of state, doctors, head administrators in hospitals, lawyers, etc. Wherever they live they are zealous to spread to society the Masonic ideas in which they have been trained. 140 However, these ideas, which Masonry persistently studies and tries to indoctrinate to society are nothing more, as we have seen in earlier sec- tions, than deceit. Masonry's philosophy stems from sources such as the myths of Ancient Egypt, Greece and the Kabbalah, and in their eagerness to transmit these myths to society, wrapped in the package of science and r eason, Masons deceive both themselves and others. In an age of global- ization, this is the role of \"Global Freemasonry.\" The result of this deceit is very detrimental. The program of alienat- ing the masses from religion, carried out by Masonry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, gave rise to neo-pagan ideologies such as racism and fascism, and secular and violent ideologies such as communism. The spread of social Darwinism deemed people to be animals struggling for their existence, the brutal results of which came about in the second half of the nineteenth century and in the twentieth century. The World War One"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DKG was the work of European leaders who, as a result of Darwin's sugges- tions, regarded war and bloodshed as a biological necessity. During that war, 10 million people went to their deaths, for nothing. The World War T wo that followed it, and in which 55 million people perished, was again the work of totalitarianism, like fascism and communism, that was the re- sult of the seeds of militant secularism sown by the Masons. Throughout the whole world, during the twentieth century, all the destructive wars, conflicts, cruelty, injustice, exploitation, hunger, and moral degradation, basically, were products of irreligious philosophies and ideologies. (For details, see Harun Yahya's The Disasters Darwinism Brought to Humanity ) In short, the philosophy of Masonry has yielded bitter fruit. It could not be otherwise as it is a divine law. Historically, those pagan peoples who rejected the religion of God, in preference of their traditional mythol- ogy and the religion of their ancestors, followed the road to destruction. Freemasonry, a contemporary manifestation of this paganism, is drawing the whole world, and themselves, into ruin. It is for this reason that human beings must protect themselves from this potential calamity, by overcoming the intimations of what Bediuzza- man Said Nursi, a renowned Islamic scholar, referred to as \"the disease called materialism and naturalism,\" and in this way preserve the faith of the masses."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"DKH C C O O N N C C L L U U S S I I O O N N asonry has been one of most interesting phenomena of the past two centuries. Naturally, it has attracted atten- tion because of its closed, reserved and mystical charac- ter. At the same time, an antipathy to Masonry has arisen; it attempts to advertise itself as a \"harmless charitable institution,\" while a determined opposition to Masonry has grown as a result of the contradictory claims of the organization. However, what must be done in order to oppose Masonry is not to adopt a blind anti-Masonic agenda, but to discern and show the invalidity of the perverse philosophy that this organization espouses and imposes on humanity. The great Islamic scholar Bediuzzaman Said Nursi describes in one paragraph the main outline of such a duty: A tyrannical current born of Naturalist and Materialist philosophy will grad- ually become strong and spread at the end of time by means of materialist philosophy, reaching such a degree that it denies God... It is clear just what foolish buffoonery it is for impotent man, who may be defeated by a fly and cannot create even a fly's wing, to claim godhead. 141 In other words, the current of materialist ideas that will emerge in the ` `"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"GLOBAL FREEMASONRY DKI end times will go so far as to deny the existence of God. In response, it must be shown what \"foolish buffoonery\" this is, and the proofs of the ex- istence of God as revealed in the Qur'an must be made known. This is the way to approach the struggle against Masonry. The im- portant thing to do is to invalidate and overcome Masonic philosophy. It is necessary to destroy the influence of the ideas of this organization, that silently and from a distance carries out its mass propaganda campaign, and distances people away from their faith and draws them away from their religion and to materialist, humanist and Darwinist myths. More- over, it is necessary to reverse this flow, and to tell people about the exis- tence of God, His Unity, and the truth of religion. And, this must be done at least as deliberately and patiently as the Masons. Actually, this is not a struggle against Masonry because the goal is also to save Masons who are themselves deceived. The command given in the Qur'an to the godless people of 'Ad and Thamud applies to the situa- tion of Masons: \"Satan made their actions seem good to them and so de- barred them from the Way, even though they were intelligent people.\" (Qur'an, 29: 38) The goal is to show the truth to all people, including Masons, and to save them from their error. A characteristic of the end times is the ease by which this struggle be- comes for the believers. This is because, science, that Masons have used in support of their philosophy for the past two hundred years, has now turned against them. The theory of evolution, which had provided sup- port for both materialism and humanism, has been in severe decline since the 1970's. The fossil record clearly denies the claims of this theory, by re- vealing that species appeared abruptly and fully formed, without an \"evo- lutionary ancestor.\" Biochemistry, examining minute aspects of living things, has demonstrated marvelous instances of design that cannot be explained in terms of natural causes. Genetic comparisons have shown that species supposed to be close relatives, according to the Darwinist"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"DKJ TAPINAKÇILAR'DAN ESK‹ MISIR'A CONCLUSION \"tree of life,\" are in fact very distinct in terms of genetic make-up. Science has rebelled against the theory of evolution, a fact that cannot be hidden any longer by evolutionists. It is necessary to use the evidences that sci- ence has brought forward and inform the masses of the invalidity of mate- rialist-humanist philosophy. Masonry has been able for some time and with effective methods of propaganda to make the masses accept a false idea. To tell the truth and aid people in accepting it is much easier. When Muslims undertake this duty, with God's permission, the fol- lowing pronouncement will become manifest: \"Rather We hurl the truth against falsehood and it cuts right through it and it vanishes clean away!\" (Qur'an, 21:18) Then, the twentyfirst century will not be the century of \"Global Freemasonry\" as the Masons had hoped, but the century of Islamic moral- ity.
