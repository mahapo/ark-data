Volumes have been written upon the presumed connection of Freemasonry with that vague gnosis of the past, called \"the Ancient Mysteries, \" but con- cerning the intimate nature of the teaching imparted to initiates, follow- ing upon the ceremonies of reception, of which classic writers have given us some notion, nothing remains to us but widely scattered symbols . It has been the pleasant life-work of the writer to join together, as best lie could, the scattered pieces of this stupendous \"cut out\" puzzle and reconstitute the ancient fabric in such a manner as would stand the test of scientific examination and deserves to live for the benefit of future generations of men and Masons . These papers have been written as an elementary course designed to arouse interest in a far deeper investiga- tion of the whole subject . Notwithstanding the designedly universal character of the craft, the externals of Freemasonry possess an altogether human tendency to be- come reflexes of the communities in which they flourish . The re-nascent Masonic intellectual activity of the past few years, no more splendid example of which can be cited than the foundation and upbuilding of the National Masonic Research Society, throws strongly into relief the fact that our American Masonry, has, until quite recently, exerted little effort on other than social and fraternal lines . The won derful development of Masonic benevolent institutions throughout the United States, has reflected the brotherhood and liberality of Masonic manhood, but it has been accomplished in the presence of an almost total oblivion of what was once the principal reason for the existence of Masonic associations . This consisted in the enlightenment of those who were found worthy and well qualified to receive deeper insight into the philosophy of exist- ence and hidden historical truths of a nature too disturbing of common acceptances to' be spread broadcast among the masses . So, in the absence of fostering interest, American Masonry has been, little by little, so divested of all connection with the pursuit of the deeper Masonic sig- nificances, as to have become, on the side of progressive speculation, a pale shadow of the Old World Craft . The true philosophic mission of Masonry, such as was the original intention of the \"symbolic\" Lodge, no less than the Scottish Rite, could scarcely be better expressed, than in the 5"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"following translation from the Spanish, of a lecture intended for the edification of a foreign Lodge . \"Know, Brother, by that which has already been shewn you and may yet come to your knowledge through the enlightening medium of History, that in the days of antiquity, in India, in Persia, in Egypt and in Greece and Rome, the first initiates in the principles, designed in their purity to serve as the foundation of universal Masonry, especially the sacerdotal and other privileged classes, profiting by the knowledge gained and iniquitously turning awry the straight path of progress in under- standing, instead of fulfilling a mission of noble civilization . mounted and grasping the reins of inordinate power, especially throughout the Eastern world, tyrannized over the Nations . \"Initiation, during the ages to which I refer, consisted in the com- munication of certain philosophical truths, of a Natural order, enabling man to profit by the productive periods of Mother Earth, who is prodigal of her fruits at certain epochs but at others displays herself less liberal, also in the imparting of certain liberal Arts, which gave special ad- vantages to those who exercised them, while at the same time uplifting them spiritually . \"These truths, useful practices and elevating arts, at the cost of terrific struggles, sustained century after century, have finally become the patrimony of all mankind, with exception, perhaps, of the relatively few which, through various circumstances remain beyond the grasp of ordinary humanity . \"In the ages of which I speak, that which was most important, was a correct knowledge of the seasons of the year, with especial reference to the productiveness of the earth, and as there were no industries directed to the multiplication, cultivation and preservation of her gifts, this knowledge constituted the bread of the hungry and the daily food of entire peoples . \"Thus it was that astronomical notions were deified and that the Sun, observed as the genius of good and considered the Creator, in perpetual strife with the principles of Evil, residing in the mists and darkness sup- plied by the terrors of human imagination, became the origin of mytho- logical allegories, more or less poetical in character, according to the varied spirituality of the races of mankind .\" The following pages accommodate little more than a series of allu- sions, but it has been sought to render them sufficiently consecutive, to present a comprehensive picture, to the reader, of the ground over which he must travel in search of true Masonic origins and significances .

From the very beginning of things down to the 15th century, archi- tecture is the great book of the human race, man's chief means of ex- pressing the various stages of his development, whether physical or mental . When the memory of the primitive races began to be surcharged, when the load of tradition carried about by the human family grew so heavy and disordered that the Word, naked and fleeting, ran danger of being lost by the way, they transcribed it on the ground by the most visible, the most lasting, and at the same time most natural means . They inclosed each tradition in a monument . The first monuments were simply squares of rock \"which had not been touched by iron,\" as says Moses . Architecture began like all writ- ing . It was first an alphabet . A stone was planted upright, and it was a letter, and each letter was a hieroglyph, and on every hieroglyph rested a group of ideas, like the capital on the column . Thus did the primitive races act at the same moment over the entire face of the globe . One finds the \"upright stone\" of the Celts in Asiatic Siberia and on the pampas of America . Presently they constructed words . Stone was laid upon stone, these granite syllables were coupled together, the Word essayed some combina- tions . The Celtic dolmen and cromlech, the Etruscan tumulus, the He- brew gligal, are words ; some of them, the tumulus in particular, are proper names . Occasionally, when there were many stones and . a vast expanse of ground, they wrote a sentence . The immense mass of stones at Karnae is already a complete formula . Last of all they made books . Traditions had ended by bringing forth symbols, under which they disappeared like the trunk of a tree under its foliage . These symbols, in which all humanity believed, continued to grow and multiply, becoming more and more complex . Of necessity the symbol must expand into the edifice . 7"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 THE BEGINNING OF MASONRY Architecture followed the development of human thought : it became a giant with a thousand heads, a thousand arms, and caught and concen- trated in one eternal, visible, tangible form all this floating symbolism . The parent idea, the Word, was contained not only in the foundation of these edifices, but in their structure . Solomon's Temple, for example, was not simply the cover of the sacred book : it was the sacred book itself . On each of its concentric inclosures the priest might read the Word trans- lated and made manifest to the eye, might follow its transformation from sanctuary to sanctuary, till at last he could lay hold upon it in its final tabernacle, under its most concrete form, which yet was architecture,- the Ark . Thus the Word was inclosed in the edifice ; but its image was visible on its outer covering, like the human figure depicted on the coffin of a mummy . Thus during the first 6,000 years of the world-from the most im- memorial temple of Hindustan to the Cathedral at Cologne-architecture has been the great manuscript of the human race . And this is true to such a degree that not only every religious symbol, but every human thought, has its page and its memorial in that vast book . The reign of many masters succeeding the reign of one, is written in architecture . For-and this point we must emphasize-it must not be supposed that it is capable only of building temples, of expressing only the sacerdotal myth and symbolism, of transcribing in hieroglyphics on its stone pages the mysterious Tables of the Law . Were this the case, then- seeing that in every human society there comes a moment when the sacred symbol is worn out, and is obliterated by the free thought, when the man breaks away from the priest, when the growth of philosophies and systems eats away the face of religion-architecture would be unable to reproduce this new phase of the human mind : its leaves, written upon the right side, would be blank on the reverse ; its work would be cut short ; its book incomplete . But that is not the case . This was the only form, however, in which free thought was possible, and therefore it found full expression only in those books called edifices . Under that form it might have looked on at its own burning at the hands of the common hangman had it been so imprudent as to venture into man- uscript ; the thought embodied in the church door would have assisted at the death agony of the thought expressed in the book . Therefore, having but this one outlet, it rushed toward it from all parts ; and hence the countless mass of cathedrals spread over all Europe, a number so pro- digious that it seems incredible, even after verifying it with one's own eyes . All the material, all the intellectual forces of society, converged to that one point,--architecture . In this way, under the pretext of bu i lding churches to the glory of God, the art developed to magnificent proportions .

For the rest, this phenomenon of an architecture belonging to the people, succeeding an architecture belonging to a caste, which we have observed in the Middle Ages, occurs in precisely analogous stages in human intelligence at other great epochs of history . Thus-to sum up here in a few lines a law which would call for volumes to do it justice- in the Far East, the cradle of primitive history . after Hindu architec- ture comes the Phenician, that fruitful mother of Arabian architecture ; in antiquity, Egyptian architecture . of which the Etruscan style and the Cyclopean monuments are but a variety, is succeeded by the Greek, of which the Roman is merely a prolongation burdened with the Cartha- ginian dome ; in modern times, after Romanesque architecture comes the Gothic . And if we separate each of these three divisions, we shall find that the three elder sisters, Hindu, Egyptian . and Roman archi- tecture, stand for the same idea : namely, theocracy, caste, unity, dogma, God, and that the three younger sisters . Phenician . Greek, Gothic, whatever the diversity of expression inherent in their nature, have also the same significance, liberty, the people, humanity . Call him Brahmin, Magi, or Pope, according as you speak of Hindu, Egyptian, or Roman buildings, it is always the priest, and nothing but the priest . Very different are the architectures of the people : they are more opulent and less saintly . In the Phenician you see the merchant, in the Greek the republican, in the Gothic the burgess . The general characteristics of all theocratic architectures are im- mutability, horror of progress, strict adherence to traditional lines, the consecration of primitive types, the adaptation of every aspect of man and nature to the incomprehensible whims of symbolism . Dark and mysterious book, which only the initiated can decipher ! Furthermore, every form, every deformity even, in them has a meaning which renders it inviolable . On the other hand, the main characteristics of the popular archi- tectures are diversity, progress, originality, richness of design, perpetual change . They are already sufficiently detached from religion to take thought for their beauty, to tend it, to alter and improve without ceas- ing their garniture of statues and arabesques . They go with their times . They have something human in them which they continue to express themselves . Here you get edifices accessible to every spirit, every in- telligence, every imagination ; symbolic still, but as easily understood as the signs of Nature . Between this style of architecture and the theo- cratic there is the same difference as between the sacred and the vulgar tongue, between hieroglyphics dnd art, between Solomon and Phidias .

And why? Because every thought, whether religious or philosophic, is anxious to be perpetuated ; because the idea that has stirred one gen- eration longs to stir others, and to leave some lasting trace . But how precarious is the immortality of the manuscript ! How far more solid, enduring, and resisting a book is the edifice ! To destroy the written word there is need only of a torch and a Turk .

He credits it with a continuous and unbroken existence extending in one form or another over a period of at least 6,000 years . All the groundwork connecting the mid-period history of Freema- sonry with the Dionysiac artificers, the Collegia Romana, the C, omacine architects, the medieval temple and cathedral builders, etc ., may be conceded without argument and is probably correct -but none of it goes far enough . Only sentimental reasons have ever been given for these associations of mystic architects and builders, while most writers take it blandly for granted that the average mortar mixer of ancient days was a learned mystic as well . Friendship, morality, and brotherly love have doubtless played great and inspiring parts in cementing such numbers of brethren of the rule and plumb ; but they have been the conse- quences, not the incentives, of such unions . These noble attri- butes ruled in but not over them . Freemasonry has to a certain extent shared the fate and followed the course of all organizations of like weight and char- acter, in completely surviving all recollection of its primal im- pulse ; but we must consider that its founders were dealing with a system of perpetuating truth by means of imperishable sym- bols, and that they must have originally foreseen that this system would survive without the aid of either written record or graphic key to its mysteries . If we are able to justify this by proving that such a system might be started at this or any other age of the world, we shall make no incredible statement in averring that such was the beginning of our ancient craft . Every phrase of our ritual is fraught with such meaning, every obligation is couched in phraseology that admits of no other construction . Freemasonry possesses the most stupendous and awe-in- spiring secret ever imparted by revelation of Deity to mankind . It is not, however, an unknowable or unknown secret . It is the precious heritage of Freemasonry's greatest existing antagonist, the Church of Rome, of the Sufi of Mohammedanism, the Druse of Syria, the Parsees and Brahmins of India and the Lamas of 11"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"12 \t THE BEGINInNG OF MASONRY Tibet . It was the mystery of the ancient Magi, of the founders of the faiths of Babylonia and Assyria, of Egypt and Phenicia, of Greece and Rome, of the Druids of Gaul . the Mithraics of Persia, the patriarchs of the Jews, and the sponsors of Chris- tianity .

No oath nor obligation today hedges about the onetime deep- est wisdom that man was able to attain .-a wisdom that even the lapse of ages and majestic strides of modern science have failed to render obsolete ; for it is all science in one, the law of harmony that rules the universe . This was the science of \"thrice-great\" Hermes, of Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Pytha- goras, and Jesus, proclaimed by each : to those who could under- stand the language in which it was permitted them to reveal and which may, even now, be interpreted to the worthy and well qualified . If this secret have any message for our time and conditions greater than it has ever borne to humanity, it is the much- needed lesson of the end of all controversy in the Brotherhood of Man under the Fatherhood of God . It is more than a senti- ment, more than a chance or a coincidence, this wedding of sa pure religious contemplation of an only true and living God to the materials, tools, and implements of architecture, this undevi- ating adherence to the ritualism of a mishandled race, which of all peoples of the earth, has preserved and handed down the notion of Deity as a Shepherd of Lambs and a Divine Patron of Architecture addressing his holy prophets in the language, some- times of one and sometimes of the other . It is in the age-long absence of anything like systematic pursuit of the clues arising from these facts that Freemasonry has become a sort of intellectual no-man's land, open to the as- saults of the wildest conjecture and most trivial speculation . On this latter basis, almost exclusively, has the literature of the craft been built up . It is only within the last few years that have appeared a few well-considered studies of the more salient phases which have not been intended to prop up some improbable theory .

It is therefore obvious that there can be no successful Ma- sonic research that is not also biblical research, reverently and patiently conducted, for the purpose of ascertaining the precise connecting links that have raised up, in addition to innumerable religious bodies, an auxiliary organization counting its votaries by the million which, while disavowing sectarianism, is neverthe- less one of the most militant, persistent, and potent factors for the uplift of humanity and the perpetuation of divine worship that the world has ever known . Theosophy and Masonry There is an extensive volume of literature based on the as- sumption by Theosophists that Theosophists are the old orig- inal Freemasons, and that their esoteric teachings contain all that is of value in Freemasonry and reach far beyond it . It will suffice merely to quote Dr . J . E . Buck's \"Mystic Masonry,\" Rev . C . H . Vail's \"Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry,\" and \"The Great Work\" by T . K . to supply most entertaining examples of this interesting idea . All of these are painstaking and certainly scholarly attempts to assert a connection between Theosophy and Freemasonry . There are several student bodies of Masonic Theosophists, or Theosophical Masons-whichever sounds more acceptable . Several of the best known and most capable Masonic essayists in this country and in England are ardent Theosophists, whose voluminous writings are always fall of allusions to Masonry as a collateral branch of their favorite speculation . We wish to be entirely respectful to both those who do and those who do not credit a connection between Masonry and Theosophy . Taking the entire ritual of the three degrees of the Blue Lodge, as we know them, and in addition the Mark Master and Royal Arch degrees, no such things as constitute what avowed Theosophists call \"Theosophy\" are taught in them . The mo- ment, however, that the analytical mind begins to dwell upon the intricacies of the Masonic ritual and its spirited action in dramatic presentation, it is perceived that every phrase is a"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1 4 \t THE BEGINNING OF MASONRY studied allusion to something far deeper than the proffered ex- planation . This profundity is not an illusion . It is thoroughly genuine ; but it is not specifically accounted for in any part of our work beyond the intimation that diligent search will be re- warded with ultimate truth if the seeker persevere to the end . One may speak more plainly of \"Theosophy,\" meaning simply \"God-Wisdom\" or \"God's Truth,\" which is secret only in so far as the uninstructed are unable to comprehend its abstruse phraseology, the key words of which are largely from the San- skrit . The moment that Theosophy becomes dogmatic it departs from the original intention of its modern sponsors and becomes at least a religion in the making . We cannot concern ourselves with the immortal characters or perpetual reincarnation of \"Masters,\" or in the vague stories of secret hoards of wisdom buried in caves among the Himalayas, and the catalepsies and clairvoyances of \"adepts,\" because, unless we be \"adepts\" our- selves, in which case we should have no need to ask questions, we have no means of discriminating among the genuine, the self- deluded, and the impostor, the inevitable trinity of all so-called \"occult\" investigation . The term \"Theosophy\" is so elastic that it can be made to embrace every species of speculation in matters guarded under a veil of secrecy, and such is certainly the case so far as most American Theosophists are concerned . The fact that Masonry is ancient, guarded, and in a sense scientific sets up a series of analogies with that which Theosophy claims, rendering it ex- tremely easy for an enthusiast, versed in both systems, to estab- lish a series of parallels of great plausibility . It is only borrow- ing one of the favorite reasonings of the Theosophists them selves to express an opinion that both are descended by different channels from an identical source . The Ancient Mysteries \"The Ancient Mysteries\" is a modern term invented for the purpose of gathering under a single specific classification all the curious rites, ceremonies, and ritualistic allusions of prechristian ages which are described to us in classic works . None of these documents enlighten us upon other than the externals . They tell us far less of what transpired in the ancient Temples of Initiation than the curious bystander may learn of modern Masonry by mere dint of keeping his ears open . While analogies without end are discernible . between our"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE BEGLYNIVG OF MASONRY 15 own secret work and some of the traditions of ancient initia- tions, what has been held back for the advancement of science during our present age to reveal, has been the fundamental philosophy of which these ceremonies were merely illustrative . TTp to a few years ago, the dramatic action of the Ancient Mysteries was, so far as any one was able to give a reasonable explanation of it, completely devoid of sense ; but the penetra- tion of European savants into the wealth of Oriental sacred and philosophical literature has unlocked a mine of precise informa- tion heretofore unimaginable . No matter who or what constituted the prehistoric popula- tion of ancient Europe and Asia Minor, the fact is that it was always inferior to and doomed to disappear or be absorbed by the great Indo-Germanic invasions, which swarmed westward, at intervals, from a central home, somewhere at the foot of the Hindu-gush Mountains . Extensive invasions of both white and yellow Asiatics were successive and continuous, over many hundred years . The last on record was that of the Huns under Attila, if we except the Turks . They must have begun, however, at least 5,000 to 7,000 years before the Christian era . It was when this Aryan people was still locked in the bosom of central Asia that the mind of man first began to speculate in the higher mathematics and the be- ginning of science began to supplant mere childish wonder and barbarous fetishism . Mathematics and geometry, joined to an ardent pursuit of astronomy in regions most favorable to obser- vation where only the naked eye was to be depended on, were made the basis of all human speculation upon the nature and attributes of the Tnfinite . It must be remembered that it was only well within the Christian era that every human considera- tion was supposed to be so dependent upon planetary influences that the entire science of medicine consisted in the selection of plant, animal, and mineral substances, which because of their planetary affinities would counteract human ills . For thousands of years nothing could be began, pursued, or finished without consulting the stars for propitious occasions, and so a vast system of philosophy was gradually built up of those three scientific ingredients . The Secret Doctrine This original philosophy is really the foundation of what Theosophists call the \"Secret Doctrine,\" and the initiatory cere- monies by which men were inducted into its enlightening pres-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1 6 THE BEGINNING OF MASONRY ence were what we now call the \"Ancient Mysteries,\" many of the symbols of which still survive in the Masonic Lodge . The advancement of understanding in these \"Secret Doc- trines\" received a setback through hundreds of years on the part of organizations that wished to monopolize all knowledge and practice of the Ancient Mysteries, and it has been only during the last century that the great gulfs that separated Occident and Orient have been successfully bridged by savants who have, piece by piece, reconstructed the whole ancient fabric . Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, and India are every day yielding up long buried secrets, which throw a bright noonday glare upon the real derivations and significances of hitherto cabalistic dogmas ; which are not proved untrue, but truer in altered senses than were ever dreamed of . 'Under the protection of modern toleration, work is being done by excavators on the sites of ancient cities and translators of long buried documentary testimony to the participation of our ancient brethren in all of our most interesting philosophical speculations and how close they approached us in actual mental achievement . The persecu- tion of one Galileo or the holocaust of 100,000 Huguenots would today be insufficient to stem the tide of discovery . Theosophy is based upon a study of the \"Secret Doctrine\" derived by modern students from Indian (Hindu) sources direct . Masonry is what is left, after centuries of vicissitude, of its western development . In neither case was the original fund one of deception or charlatanism ; but, let us again repeat, it was the science of the ancient world\" expressed, through rever- ence, in terms of awe-fraught mysticism . The Hermetic Philosophy The so-called \"Hermetic Philosophy\" is much quoted by the older writers on the subject of Masonry, and one encounters references to it in the works of the greatest of them all, the venerable Albert Pike . Bro . Pike says of the reputed founder of the so-called Hermetic School \"From the bosom of Egypt sprang a man of consummate wisdom, initiated in the secret knowledge of India, of Persia, and of Ethiopia, named Thoth or Phtha by his compatriots, Taaut by the Phenicians and Hermes Trismegistus (Thrice Great Hermes) by the Greeks .

Under him, Egypt paid homage to seven principal deities\" (the seven planets) . This is condensing into very small compass a great mass of material which has come down to us about a legendary mortal, whose every attribute as recorded is little short of miraculous, and whose supposed writings, Bro . Pike shows us, greatly influ- enced the early Christian fathers, particularly Saint Augustine, who held them in great reverence . The name \"Hermetic\" has be- come synonymous with \"conceal- ment\" or \"mysterious .\" Our naive forefathers certainly gave little trouble to the mystery mongers ; but seemed to exercise their powers of credence like a professional strong man his muscles . They saw little to wonder at in the million and one familiar things that are the marvels of science today ; but seemingly laid great value upon a capacity for as- serting the impossible . It was the \"long suit\" of the wise man of once-upon-a-time to affirm \"two and two make six, and to prove it I will change this stick into a serpent .\" There is no doubt, however, that the \"Hermetic Wisdom\" merits every eulogy that could -pos- sibly be bestowed upon it ; for it was the collective science of the ancient world, so called because at- tributed by the Magian astronomers-or rather Astrologers ; for the stars were studied for omens, not physical facts-to the in- fluence of the planet Mercury . The name \"Mercury,\" or Mercurius, was the Latin trans- lation of the Greek Hermes . Like almost all astronomical names of both Greece and Rome, it is a corruption of the Syrian Mar Kurios (\"Son of the Lord\"-Sun), which in turn is a literal translation of ChR-Mes (Horns-Moses, \"the Son of Horns\") .

Moon and Mercury ; which those read in Alchemis- tic and Rosicrucian lore will not fail to recognize as the central postulate of both of those famous philosophies . They were the lesser lights of earlier rituals . Virgo is Demeter or C eres, and consequently the Kubele and Cybele of the \"square stone\" ; Gemini, the twins, are the youthful Hercules and Apollo (\"Strength and Beauty\") ; while Hermes, in the house of Demeter (Virgo), is the Divine Wis- dom-for it must be remembered that to the initiate all these pagan deities were but the attributes, emanations, or perceptible qualities of the \"One\" God . no matter what the \"profane\" im- agined them to be . As the secret wisdom of the alchemists, developed from the ancient Hebrew Kabbalah, tells us, the combination of \"sulphur, salt and mercury\" is that which produces the \"living Gold,\" mercury being denoted the \"bond\" that unites the other two . The alchemical signs for these three elements-or rather four, for under the first, sulphur . was hidden \"fire,\" under the second, \"earth,\" and under (two signs of) Mercury, air and water\"- were respectively the sun, moon and the planet Mercury . Al- chemy was really a secret school of philosophy, teaching the same truths as Masonry once taught, only employing the termi- nology of the chemist and refiner of metals instead of that of the builder . By this combination is really meant the threefold nature of man-the \"soul,\" which the ancients held to emanate from the sun ; the \"body,\" which came under the special influence of the moon ; and \"spirit,\" or mental intelligence, which was the gift of Hermes or Mercury-the \"mind,\" or mans, as it was called in Sanskrit, being that which specifically constituted \"man .\" There is every reason to believe that this doctrine underlay the entire fabric of ancient philosophical paganism, and that the reason why it has not descended to us in the classics is just be- cause it was the \"Hermetic\" or sealed wisdom .

Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry We frequently hear of an alleged connection between Free- masonry and so-called \"Rosicrucianism\" brotherhoods . In the course of the last couple of centuries there have been many hun- dred claims set up to the title of \"Society\" or \"Fraternity\" of the Rosy Cross . Any brother who feels inclined to dip into the question of extinct Masonic rites and degrees, by a short course of Mackey's Masonic Encyclopedia, will be, if not already informed, astonished to find that all the Masonry we are officially aware of today is but a mere fragment of all that has at one time or other figured as of impressive importance to the craft . In the archives of the Scottish Rite are preserved evidences of the voluntary abdications of a number of_ imposing Masonic \"rites\" that once enjoyed high favor and numerous member- ship, but which eventually dissolved, under pressure of internal dissensions, and the larger hope embodied in the rise of a body so constituted as to obviate the possibility of unbecoming strife and other weaknesses . At the present moment the empty dignities and now mean- ingless powers of obsolete rites are occasionally heard of as passed from hand to hand, for trifling money considerations, wherever a gull can be induced to believe that he is receiving high Masonic degrees, even though the same may be conferred upon him by a single individual I I by virtue of powers,\" etc ., in a basement dining room or hall bedroom . The chief significance that attaches itself to the revival of interest in the Rosicrucians lies in the fact that, according to the strict spirit of the ancient brotherhood, there can be but one organization in existence entitled to their name and secrets, and that organization never had nor, it is claimed, never will have any public or exoteric existence . It is not the sort of club or society that has officers, holds public or even private meetings and elects eligible persons to membership ."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE BEGINNING of MASONRY \t 2 1 The true Rosicrucian may never meet another of his mystic order on the physical plane . He is not initiated in a hall or chapter room after having paid a fee ; but it is made known to him by occult means that he has been found worthy of admission into this literal band of immortals, and thereafter he is shown how to project his perceptions on to a higher plane upon which it is possible for him to meet, know and commune with all his fel- low members, who assemble like witches upon a sabbat, in a twinkling of an eye, by merely willing to do so, no matter where their physical bodies may happen to be sojourning . In fact, the first public gossip concerning the Rosicrucians and their wonderful powers began to be bruited about at the beginning of the seventeenth century . Membership in the fra- ternity was attributed to various alchemists by the herd, and claimed by numerous charlatans on the other hand . Many tales are told of the discovery of weird underground vaults in other- wise desert places, which upon being opened were found to be brilliantly illuminated by perpetually burning lamps-that is to say, until extinguished by the admission of outer air . These were said to have been the secret meeting places of the Rosicrucians . From the very nature of Rosicrucianism as described, how- ever, that of tradition must necessarily be spurious, as the mere fact of publicity, upon however private or restricted a scale, is sufficient to stamp it as such . The existence of Rosicrucianism might be claimed, and certain highly endowed scholars and scien- tists be suspected-nay, openly charged-with being members of its charmed circle ; but no genuine record exists of any ancient Rosicrucian Society upon which any theory of continuity might be based by a modern group of students of the occult . There is quite a successful modern Rosicrucian Society in London, the moving spirit of which was the late Dr . Wynn West- cott, formerly coroner for the County of Middlesex .

Our own craft has hardly departed from the use of ancient monitors and lectures connecting Masonry with the beginnings of the human race-Adam, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Moses, and other patriarchs-which had become a laughing stock among our stren- uous modernists, when it begins to transpire that the structure of Freemasonry is superior to her traditions, and that he who knows Masonry structurally will have no difficulty whatever in comprehending all these curious connections as apt and pur- poseful . When this knowledge becomes more common to the fraternity we shall be in a position to understand the difference between that which guarantees the genuineness of our own antiquity and the claims that any mystical brotherhood may at present set up, of surpassing age, royal descent, and the possession of the fundamental arcane of the universe, without the average Mason's being able to prove that his pretensions have any greater value than those of the newcomer . God and Masonry There is no place in Masonry for dogmatic controversy af- fecting the current convictions of brethren of the craft . In its highest contemplation Freemasonry solely regards and addresses itself to the \"Great Architect of the Universe,\" respecting the Names under which this Unique Identity is apostrophized in every clime, by every race, and by every school of thought . There are no religious differences attached to the adoration of the Supreme Being . Men differ alone with respect to some of His manifestations of love and solicitude for humanity, malting claims to an exclusiveness in one respect or another, which are too often the outgrowth of fast-vanishing racial isolations and the diverse trends of thought consequent upon differences of origin, climate, and environment . In quibbling over these differences, so frequently the result of misunderstandings of identical premises, viewed from diverg- ing angles, men are too prone to forget that the goodness and providence of Almighty God is forever pouring in a mighty deluge upon us, manifesting itself unceasingly and impartially in everything that either experiences or can be experienced .

Many of the ancient philosophers, therefore, taught that man could attain supreme contentment only by realizing his identity with the All . Sensing this, he per- ceived the resistless operation of the great laws of Being, in per- fect poise, harmony, and impartiality, requiring only to be heeded for man to escape the evils and enjoy the benefits thereof during his allotted term, the accidents and mishaps befalling him not be- ing subject to the caprices of an unpropitious Ruler, but conse- quent upon his own unguarded collisions with unchangeable law . Therefore the whole problem of human life became the at- tainment of greater and ever greater knowledge of the natural law, upon which all progress and all security to life and happi- ness depended in so eminent a degree, and the divine gift of the reasoning faculties, which rendered this possible, was appre- ciated as God's most precious blessing to man . Thousands of years of experiment and ceaseless vigilance on the pert of eager watchers have never resulted in the detection of a single prin- ciple so unrelated to the rest of the universal machine as to have no dependence upon it . Even where the wonders of science have disclosed marvels so intricate as to baffle explanation or analysis, they have at least proved so entirely subject to certain conditions of known factors as to be easily provoked into mani- festation or suppressed from view, at the will of man . Year by year, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, the infinite details of this great cosmos-pervading law keep on un- folding to human perception, filling all space with their greatness and mocking pursuit in their ultramicroscopic perfections and yet nothing is discovered that had not existence ages before the human mind began to concern itself with its intricacies .

Yet the mind of man, framed in the image of the Creator, even as the receiver of an acoustic instrument must be attuned -to the vibrations of the transmittor, that the message may be received as it is sent, has discovered constant and unchanging elements in this stupendous order of varied manifestations . has discovered chaos-banishing laws which must be the same in an atom as in a sun . and so may be e xh ibited in symbols of dimensions convenient to the stature of contemplative man .

NOW ."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Masonry's Real Secret Freemasonry is not only all that its most enthusiastic pane- gyrist ever proclaimed it to be on sentimental, moral, and fra- ternal grounds, but it is fundamentally and structurally a system of natural theology, proving the existence and attributes of the one true God to the satisfaction of the intellect, and so supplying a bulwark to faith unattainable by any other means . The nature of this proof, although formulated before the pyramids were built, is not so abstruse as might at first be imagined, and is founded on precisely the same assumption as the natural theo- logy of a Paler or a Brougham of our own era-that evidence of design or intention proves the presence of Hind, the wisdom, power, and beauty of which may be inferred from the result . As in natural theology we look for evidence of a thinking, contriving, planning, improving, wise and beneficent Mind of in- finite volume, controlling and directing all things, so let us search among the remaining relics of our remote ancestors for evidence, that, as Kipling exquisitely sings in his ballad of the \"Builder,\" \"They too had known .\" The evidence is incontrovertible, and Masonry is the evidence . Ancient priesthood believed that the great mass of mankind was too undeveloped to comprehend a philosophy of divinity based upon more or less scientific premises . Therefore, they carefully conserved their special knowledge, imparting it only to chosen initiates, while treating the masses to a spectacular exo- teric system . Such was in fact the origin of the dual system that has prevailed through the ages, which was as much a part of Ju- daism and primitive and mediaeval Christianity as of the pagan idolatries, by which the priests knew and the people thought they knew . Even some of our most common superstitions are relics of this state of things . All the prejudice popularly entertained against the number 13 resides not in its \"unluckiness,\" but be- cause it was the key to religions mysteries that the priests did not wish the people to penetrate ; hence, if a man started to run every time he encountered this number and would refuse to think of it for fear of breaking his leg, the sacerdotal interests were safe . 25"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"26 \t THE BEGINNING OF MASONRY When the period approached that the average citizen knew more than the hierophant of former years, he was not encour- aged, but repressed, and instead of being admitted to the Mys- teries was driven back with curses, so that the priestly caste might retain its ascendancy . Notable exceptions to this were the examples of Egypt and Greece, where enlightenment was, at cer- tain ages, almost universal . It was the suppression of the Mys- teries that enslaved Europe for centuries . If the ultimate and all-sustaining secret of Freemasonry may be openly expressed in a few words, it will be these : The entire course of nature is manifested in cycles . Some of these are scientifically real, others are but appearances based upon the presence and position of the observer upon the earth, away from which they have no true existence . For instance, there is no night except as we are temporarily on the shadow side of our globe during its diurnal rotation . There is this movement of the earth upon its axis ; there is the annual revolution that we term the year ; and there is the stupen- dous cycle called the precession of the equinoxes, which requires near- ly 26,000 years for its accomplish- ment . There are the relative velocities and courses of the planets, the axial revolution of the * sun, their angles of inclina- tion, the atomic weights of metals, the phenomena of light, color . crystalization, and gravitation . These can be technically ex- pressed in no other wav than in terms of mathematics and geo- metry . When the results are expressed in their simplest forms, the latter prove to be the same rudimentary geometrical figures that supply the structure of crystals, and all blend together into the marvelous triangle that caused old Pythagoras to cry \"Eureka!\" when its beauties burst upon him . By careful computation we are able to reconstruct this really divine system, and we find that the exact proportions relating to the celestial correlation in question were lavishly and exclusively employed in the architecture of all the temples of old, in all the culture lands of the world, both east and west . Still greater does our wonder grow when we recognize in lodge and chapter the whole mechanism of this wonderful natural science, and what was before hidden and dark bursts upon us as a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole . The Pythagorean Triangle ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Pythagoras and Freemasonry The man whose name will always be indelibly associated with the above Triangle and the celebrated figure called the ' 1 47th Problem of Euclid\" derived from it, is the great Greek Initiate and Teacher, Pythagoras of Krotona (B . ' . 570-500) . We frequently see it called into question as to whether Py- thagoras and his famous problem had really anything to do with the foundation of Freemasonry as the older writers on the sub- ject claim . Personally lie wrote nothing . His principal chroniclers were Philolaus (B . C . 370) and Jamblichus (A . 1) . 340) . He is quoted and otherwise referred to by many others, and what we learn of his philosophy from these sources indicates that the \"number philosophy\" of the Gnostic sect of Marcionites strongly resembled it . A great revival of Pythagorean philosophy took place in Europe during the latter part of the 17th century, just at the period when Freemasonry be- gan to attract public attention . Johannes Meursius (1620), Marcus Meibonius (1650), and Athanasius Kircher (a Jesuit, 1660) collected and republished all the fragments they could find from the preceding authorities . If Pythagoras studied philosophy among the Medean Magi at Babylon-and the records at least state that he was a pupil of the Chaldeans-he imbibed from them the pure Semitic philosophy thus expressed in his transmitted sayings : \"The Monad is God and the good, which is the origin of the One and is itself Intelligence . The Monad is the beginning of everything . Unity is the principle of all things .\" If Pythagoras was, as credibly stated, initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries in Greece, the Mysteries of Isis in Egypt, and the Brahmanic Mysteries at Elephanta and Ellora, India, he learned the same truth in each of these places, where the Appor- heta communicated to the Epopt (i . e ., supreme secret disclosed to the highest initiate) was always the same, viz ., that there is but ONE God . The great crime of the ancient world was that it re- served this fact to initiates alone and publicly taught a pantheism, 27"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"28 \t THE BEGINNING OF MASONRY which to Adepts was a veiled philosophy, while the masses viewed it as a multiplicity of independent gods and goddesses . We have archeological remains of the highest antiquity to prove that this problem of the right-angled triangle of 3-4-5, of which the Euclidian figure is but one o f several possible exten- sions, was the central symbol of the religion of widely dispersed millions during many centuries . The theorems of the sacred geometry of the ancient philoso- pliers are not included in the works o f Euclid, even though subject to the same mechanical laws he expounds . This \"sacred geom- etry,\" which is the branch underlying all Masonic symbolism, was not intended for the purpose of teaching Operative Masons how to make truly square corners, but for the far more noble and glorious purpose of demonstrating the unity of God, the likeness of the human mind to the divine mind, the omnipotence and omni- presence of God, and the immortality of the soul . Waving aside the fact that 3 is a male number because odd, and 4 female because even (3 representing Osiris, 4 Isis, and 5 Horns), the importance of \"the triangle of Huramon\" (Horus- Ammon-Hiram), ages older than Pythagoras, as a human contemplation and coequal with creation as a divine principle, resides in the fact that it was the center, core, or nucleus of the ancient sacred philosophy, to which we owe so much . Its symbol for at least 5,000 years has been an eye, now the \"all-seeing eye\" of Freemasonry . From it emanated, as a plant from a seed, the various canons of symmetry and order (time, space, number, and proportion), which still reign over the heart and intelligence of man, for man does not regard as beautiful that which his eyes show him by consensus of agreement to be ugly . His recognition of the fitness of certain forms and the laws of their combinations is as much a part of nature as gravity and electricity . Quite as true as the fact that the perception of the wonderful truths we have enumerated was just cause for Brother Pytha- goras to have indulged in the somewhat extravagant barbecue at- tributed to him, is the circumstance that the prehistoric Mound Builders of America employed this same Pythagorean triangle to demonstrate the fourth dimension .

Its delineation, graphically, we prob- ably first owe to the Arab geometers of the early days of our present era, among whom no scruple could have prevailed .

In order to get our bearing, we are compelled to formulate an ascertained law of development in all of the latter . Their unique basis is the recognizable and ascertainable phe- nomena of the universe, the definition of which constitutes what modern man terms \"Science,\" but which the ancient mind re- ferred more directly to Deity, as an arbitrary power . All such definition was necessarily confined to terms of time, space, number and proportion, which can only be expressed in those of Mathematics or Geometry, the most stupendous of all contemplations being the observation of the vast cosmic machine from an astronomical standpoint . That which struck the ancient mind with the greatest won- der was, self evidently, the fact that if all of the wonders of the Universe resolved themselves into mathematical expressions and the latter into geometrical figures, often simple ones at that, which in turn melted into the simple fundamentals of the latter science, then in the latter must be found the dynamic concentra- tions which most closely approach a conception of Divinity . A further step along the line of developing rational occultism was gained by the employment of identical characters to express both letters and numbers . That which we now call the decimal system was worked by \"the power of Nine\" or \"three times three .\" The letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the Greek letters derived from an analogous source, counted from Aleph or Alpha, 1 to Teth or Theta, 9 and from Jod or Iota, 10, to Peh or Pi, 80 .

It must also be remarked thatt the Hebrew letter Vauu or 6, corre- sponded to the now missing Digamma in Greek, once placed be- tween Eta and Zeta . With this equipment we can now understand the significance of the ancient Hebrew Deity names, such as Al Shdi, Biblically translated \"God Almighty,\" (El Shaddai) or 1+30+300+4+10 -345, or 3, 4 and 5, in decimal places .

Let us remark, in passing, that Chr is the San- scrit word for \"Light,\" ECH, reversed and is the origin of the tradition that upon \"discovering\" the 47th problem, Pythagoras joyfully uttered the word Eureka . Greek mythology is full of stolen Oriental sacred words thus metamorphosed .

The number 270 (9X30) represents the number, in days, of human gestation and is the sum of 162 (Father) and 108 (Son) .

The 9+16+25=50 squares thus gave rise to the old Greek cabalistic name of the Sun, \"Damnamenos of the fifty faces .\" The Hebrews celebrated each fiftieth year as a Jubilee, calling it the \"Power of the Number Twelve\" (3+4+5) .

The ancient number-letter system of the Orient is often difficult for the Masonic student to understand ; but when one looks into it carefully it is comparatively simple . In the days before the invention of symbols for figures Hebrew scholars ex- pressed numbers by letters, and a Greek testament shows the employment of this method of expression by the Greeks also, as in Revelation xiv, 18, where the number 666 is written Xsu . Mackey's Masonic Encyclopedia refers to it under the head of \"Alphabet .\" The common origin of the two series is manifest in their agreement up to the letter P . The ancient employment of the decimal system (generally denied by scholars) is proved by the arrangements in digits, tens, and hundreds, and the greater antiq- uity of the Greek series by its agreement with Egyptian, Chal- daic and Hindu (Sanskrit) words, older than Hebrew . The many qualities peculiar to numbers and the prevalence in Nature of forms answering to the figures of geometry caused many ancient philosophers to believe that the entire scheme of the universe was based upon mathematics . Those curious scientific playthings called \"acrostics\" and \"magic squares\" were looked upon as marvels of mystic meanings, during a by- gone age . Understanding this, we can translate into their proper num- ber values the proportions, ground plans, and ornaments of ancient temples, besides countless biblical names and phrases, classic proper names, magic words, and above all the passwords of our Masonic craft which explain the acts and allusions that accompany them .

The \"nonary\" system (derived from nine, or \"3 times 3\") is identical with what we now call the \"decimal\" system . The ancients, prior to the invention of the Abacus, employed a series of decimal places running from right to left, represented by shallow dishes or holes scooped in the sand . The empty hole represented zero (position without number) . As soon as there were 10 pebbles or other counters in any hole, they were re- moved and one was placed in the decimal position to the left . By this means decimal computations up into the trillions were possible . with the precision of an adding machine . Certain numbers show the peculiarity of representing two different sa- cred quantities ; as, for instance, the number 888 . This has a special significance of its own, but was constructed from 3 times 8 (24) counters (8 units, 8 tens, and 8 hundreds)-there being a mystic relationship between the two ideas represented and between the two numbers involved . To the brother who is really interested in learning the truth about this wonderfully constituted ritual of ours, it may be emphasized that failure to know or recognize these methods of the ancients has been the reason why so many of the past ex- pounders of Masonry have failed to \"hit the mark .\" \"Three Times Three\" No term throughout the entire range of Masonic symbolism so completely clenches the connection between Freemasonry and the Ancient Mysteries as this most important link .

These two combinations are the two fundamental right angles of all geometry and the ones upon which most of our symbolisms are founded . The astounding recurrence of the number 7, not only in geometrical figures, but in countless curious objects of human speculation, caused it to be regarded with superstitious awe . It was regarded as one of good augury because most of the things beneficial to mankind came in series of sevens . When the an- cient star gazers had finally determined the planets of our universe (those, of course, discernible to the naked eye), each item of the numerous septenary sets conceived of by our fore- fathers was attributed to the influence of one of the planets, deemed the dwelling of a superior intelligence active for the good or ill of humanity .

The symbolization of the Universe by means of a Temple edifice may be traced in the earliest Mesopotamian monuments . They were originally conceived as gigantic sun-dials consti- tuted by erecting a circle of 12 upright stones around a central altar . These were the ancient Palestinian gilgals and were the patterns for the later Druidical circles . A study of their shad- ows enabled the priests to predict the changes in the seasons, knowledge extremely useful to agricultural and pastoral peoples . As time passed and knowledge increased, the forms of religious edifices were made to express this developed science . Their masses were outlined in angles which recorded the direction of the plane of the ecliptic, the earth's axis, and the equator, the elevation above the horizon of the polar star, and con- stellations heralding the equinoxes and solstices . Far antedating the Pyramids of Egypt were the step pyra- mids or seven-storied zigurrats, as the Temple observatories were called among the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Chaldeans .

Our lodge is in every respect a symbolic workshop, fur- nished with all the tools belonging to the different grades of workmen, and with a trestleboard upon which are set forth the day's designs and the material upon which the labor of the brethren is to be expended . This symbolic material consists of the two ashlars, emblem- atic of the crude material and the finished product, which are placed plainly enough on view in New York lodges, but absent or almost unknown, except to students, in many other states . The oblong stones and nondescript slabs sometimes seen are note- worthy evidence that the age-old significance of the \"cubical stone,\" which has played such a prominent role in the mythology and mysticism of the past, has almost run to oblivion in° the mod- ern craft . These stones should really be perfect cubes . The sym- bolism of the working tools is completely lost the moment such proportions are lost sight of or ignored . The ancient Hebrews had their own version of the great \"number philosophy,\" which lent sanctity and expressiveness to the number 12 . First of all, it was the number of their Twelve Tribes, who were doubtless a symbolical enrolment of all the heads of families under the zodiacal sign of the month in which they were born . It is certainly significant that the patriarchal system was founded upon this number, and later on many other dispositions were made that showed a particular reverence for the Ghaldean plan of the universe based upon 12 signs . As one cube possesses six sides, each of which is a perfect square, a number of remarkable mathematical and geometrical sym- bolisms were established based upon the fact that all the num- bers, from one to 12 added together produce 78 . This number is also the sum of 3 times \"26,\" the numerical value of the \"Great and Sacred Name of Jehovah\" (JHVH) . As each cube possesses 12 edges, the combined number re- quire a 24-inch rule to symbolize their total outline . The break- ing into different mathematical combinations of this supreme number, each significant of some one of the great ruling phe- nomena of nature, was seen in the symbolism of the use of an operative Mason's gavel in the dressing of building stones . 53"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"5 4 THE BEGINNING OF MASONRY The grand mystery name of our Creator, called the Tetra- grammaton (Greek for\"' four-letter name\") had as its root the three letters J, H, and V, which as numbers were 10, 5, and 6, or 21, the sum of the added numbers 1 to 6 represented by a single cube . This was the form of the \"Holy of Holies,\" in the great Temple of Solomon and the pious Jew, to this day, em- ploys the two symbolic cubes, in the form of Phylacteries . This fact was made the basis of a curious legend, wrought by the wise old rabbis into that marvelous compilation called the Talmud, from which more than a little of our Masonic mate- rial has been derived . The story is of the Patriarch Enoch (Hanok, father of Methuseleh), whose name means \"the initiator .\" who . all ac- counts agree, lived 365 years, or a \"year of years .\" A remark- able book attributed to him is often alluded to by the Hebrew commentators and early Christian \"Fathers\" ; but no trace of it was ever found until in the last century it turned up in Abyssinia . It has been translated out of that strange African dialect into many tongues . The so-called Book of Enoch con- tains a remarkable recital of astronomical science as known to the ancients, told entirely in allegorical form, while the history of the Children of Israel is prophesied (1) under the allegorical simile of the remarkable doings of a singularly intelligent flock of sheep which build a house for their shepherd, the whole read- ing very much like a children's fairy tale . The Talmudic legend of Enoch represents him as greatly disturbed at the news of the impending world \"Deluge,\" for fear the Name of God should be lost . He accordingly caused it to be inscribed upon a triangular plate of gold, and affixed it to a cubical stone, for the safe keeping of which he caused a series of nine arched vaults to be constructed, one beneath an- other, at the foot of Mt . Moriah (the holy mountain of the Jews, as Mt . Meru was of the Hindus) . The rains came and the flood descended, and so washed the mud and silt over the site that it became completely obliterated . Centuries later, when King David was moved \"to build an house unto the Lord,\" and actually set his workmen to dig the foundations thereof, the latter discovered the vaults, and descending therein brought to light the long-buried stone .

Moriah a symbolic one . By knowing the use of the working tools of an E .

Therefore we find the cube present in all the ancient mythol- ogies, which were but racial cloaks for one and the same wisdom religion, understood by the priests of all countries alike as a symbol of the sixth sign of the zodiac, the characters portraying the great Mother of Wisdom and her divine son Man . It is the task of the apprentice to break through the shell of matter and liberate the Divine Word that dwells within by opening his own spiritual perceptions to the light of the Logos . As the priceless statutes of Phidias and Praxiteles were once shapeless masses of unmeaning stone and the Parthenon a sea-worn crag, until gavel and gauge, mallet and chisel, in the hand of inspiration had performed their tasks, so has always been the lesson of the cube in its unshapen and shapen forms to the apprentice Mason ."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Middle Chamber We know not how old or whence emanated the ritual of Freemasonry, but we do know that when we are in search of historical parallels to almost any of its allusions we must lose ourselves in a past so distant that we can only wonder at the fidelity with which certain traditions have been preserved . How- ever much we owe to the Biblical account of Israel's great monarch and his splendid achievements in art, letters, and statesmanship, he is the subject of innumerable Oriental tradi- tions, which are unknown to Holy Writ and connect his name with a wide range of associations outside the classic ones to which we are most accustomed . His triple name of Sol-Om-On we derive from the Septu- agint, which was a translation of the Hebrew sacred books into Greek, accomplished by a commission of learned Alexandrian rabbis sent to Jerusalem for the purpose by King Ptolmey Philadelphus with the aid of a commission appointed by the then High Priest Eleazar, about B . C . 246 . These men were not only talented scribes, but were skilled in the secret science of their day, so that they were able to translate this wonderful old name back into the same form in which it had been revered among the Chaldean mystics for many centuries previously . Irrespective of its application to a historical character, the name \"Solomon\" was a cabalistic composition intended pro- foundly to symbolize Divine Wisdom . The outward form of the name expressed precisely the same symbolism as the three principal officers of the Masonic lodge,-the sun rising in the east (Sol), the sun at meridian in the south (Om), and setting in the west (On) .

The discoveries of learned travelers, especially American savants connected with the University of Pennsylvania, have established the facts beyond doubt that Jehovah was worshiped centuries before the time of Abraham by the Mesopotamian peoples, and the Divine Wisdom (Sol-Om-On), recorded in the Babylon cuneiform inscriptions as Saimanu, with the word Sar 56"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE BEGINNING OF MASONRY \t 5 7 The great Temple of Bel at Borsippa opposite Babylon, with Its seven planetary Stages ."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"58 \t THE BEGINNING OF MASONRY or King added, when the name was used as that of a monarch .

The many Masonic references to these venerated patrons certainly call for clearer definition that we receive either from ritual or monitor, and naturally direct our minds to the questions of why their names should be applied to the lodge at all, the origin of the name itself, the association that we so continually encounter in Masonic symbolism of the two Saints John with the two parallel lines, one on each side of the point within the circle, and finally the descent of this symbol- ism from anterior forms, if any can be traced . Laying aside all detail for the specialist, we must consider the enormous volume of substitution that was found necessary by the early church to adapt time--honored pagan rites and ceremonies to the new order . When the Ancient Mysteries were taken under the protection of the Roman hierarchy and diverted into the channels that have led up to their preservation in their present form of Freemasonry, it was probably deemed expedient to replace the characters of the two Hermes by others more in keeping with the new faith . Thus, all the Masonic applications of the two Saints John may be found in the ancient employments of the planet Mercury as a Mystery symbol . The ancient Babylonian pyramid temples of seven steps or stages, although each stage was dedicated to a different planet, were generally consecrated, like the great Babylonian Temple at Borsippa, to the god Nebo, who is this same alternate morn- ing and evening star .

They were also often represented by two serpents or two fishes, mov- ing in opposite directions . As the axis of our earth is always comparatively vertical to the ecliptic, as we travel on our annual course round the sun, the ancients, who knew this from observations, symbolized it by erecting 12 vertical pillars or dolmens round a central altar fire, representing the sun . \t These were the earliest places of initia- tion ; but as their principal use was to locate the pre- cise moment of the solstices by their shadows, as __ temples grew more architectural and ornate, only the solstice pillars were preserved and dedicated to Hermes . This must have been done, when the sign of Virgo, the \"Day House\" of Mercury, stood for the great Mother of Nature, as from B .

The uncovered ruins of Nineveh are everywhere carved with colossal statutes of Oannes the Fish- man, whose tradition, as the first instructor of men in the arts and sciences, reached the Tyrians as that of Dag-On, \"The fish of the getting sun,\" and the Hebrews as Jonh (translated \"Jonas\" or \"Jonah\") .

A great volume of literature has attempted to give the pillars a purely phallic significance ; but the writer has found many reasons for believing this to be an exaggeration . Among all primitive peoples a pillar erected in the center of a convenient open space served as a gnoinon, through which the daily, monthly, and annual aspects of the sun might he taken account of . The interpretation of the shadows cast by this pillar developed into quite a science, and was always the princi- pal occupation of the priestly caste, who learned thereby to pre- dict the approach and departure of the seasons correctly, thus making their wisdom indispensable to the pastoral and agricul- tural peoples whom they served . On the day of the summer solstice, at noon, when the sun stood vertically overhead, the Peruvians said that their god \"sat upon his pillar .\" As experiment succeeded experiment, perhaps over many centuries, it was discovered that a far greater range of solar phenomena could be registered through comparison of the shadows of two of these pillars, placed at some distance apart . All of these discoveries were kept locked within the breasts of the erudite priesthoods and constituted the real secrets that our ancient brethren were pledged, under fearsome penalties, to keep and conceal among the initiates of their own peculiar orders .

All these ideas are embodied in the repro- duction of a Punic stele (Phenician monument) now preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris . The human hand with extended fin- gers symbolized this number 5 . The lily on one side was an emblem of Astarte or Isis, and the pomegranate, which, aside from the exub- erance of its seed, exhibits as a transverse sec- tion a five-pointed star, an additional symbol of the Baal below, seen soaring between the pillars . With this picture we are able to contrast the well-known Masonic symbol of the point-within-the-circle between the two parallels, which is nothing less than a hieroglyph of the foregoing figure . The sun, either as a plain or winged disk or represented by one of the various Baal or Horns figures of the ancients, is supposed to be seen at a distance from between the two pillars, just as the resplendent letter in the end of the lodge room would appear from the preparation room . The eventual location of these twin pillars, in the west, arose from several causes . By the time the astronomical lore of the Chaldeans was ready to migrate to western Europe under the name of Druidism (the Druid priests were still called Culdees in Ireland), it had been ascertained that the axis of the earth al- ways maintained a semi-erect' position during its migration round the sun, and the ecliptic had been divided into the 12 equal parts or signs, corresponding to our months,, that still obtain .

We are elsewhere told that it should be \"as high as the heavens and as deep as the surface from the center,\" likewise that it is \"a representation of the universe on a reduced scale .\" Few of us who encounter these random phrases are aware of how literally true they are and how full of the true spirit of ancient Masonry . Take, for instances, a plane surface one-third longer than -it is wide . Geometrically it can mean only one thing, -a square composed of nine small squares to which three are added, making twelve, or an oblong three by four . It may comes as a surprise, but this figure, next to the cube, was the most sacred one of the ancient world . It is almost always imperfectly and incorrectly represented by the paved mosaic oblong of \"haphazard\" dimensions, occupying the center of many of our lodge room floors, upon which the symbol of a \"blazing star\" is shown, with the altar in the center . Oblongs of these precise dimensions are found all over the world,-among the amulets profusely strewn, in the mummy cases and wrappings of their dead, by the ancient Egyptians, and in the burial mounds of the long vanished American races that once dwelt from the Dakotas to the Andes . In its association with the lodge room, however, the exact relation of this particular figure to the lan- guage used in describing the former is that an ellip- tical line, exactly circumscribed within it, was taken by the ancient Egyptians, who made crude observations of the changes in the sun's apparent diameter and direction from the earth, from day to day, as the correct form of the orbit of our earth .

One would imagine that such a stupen- dous fact would be involved in a maze of incomprehensible mysteries ; but no ; there it is, in our simple 3 x 4 lodge floor, and the symbol of the sun is present to attest that those who put it there knew what they were about .

There are nevertheless wonders in Freemasonry, inherited from the Ancient Mysteries, for which there are no purely human explanations, because they are manifested upon an infinite scale . Geometry is the key, and close observation of the angles of cer- tain squares and oblongs shows it to be the medium through which we may hope to obtain a little more light upon this fas- cinating subject . Wherever two lines, traveling in whatsoever directions, cross each other, the point at which they cross may be the center of a circle of any desired extent, divided into 360 degrees, the number of which, separating the two lines as they cross the circle, is the correct angle described by such lines . There are therefore two ways of expressing any plane sur- face so that another may reproduce it from the description . One is to give its length and breadth . The other is to give its angles . The most important angle in geometry is one of 90 degrees, or the fourth part of a circle . The upright is determined by the force we call \"gravity,\" causing tbe . bob of the plumb to point directly to the center of the earth . The horizontal line is de- termined by the bubble of air in the center of our level s eeking . a n exact equilibrium for its resting point .

The cosmic wonder in this particular figure is the celebrated Triangle of Pythagoras, allusions to which have been continually cropping up in the course of these papers and from which we shall never quite depart, Neglecting for the moment its association with the great problem of Euclid, of which it is the basis, we find it to be the product of the diag- onal division of an oblong of 3x4, the same that gives us the form of our lodge .

An alternately colored and white paved work long ago acquired the name of \"Mosaic pavement,\" associating it with the great Hebrew seer and lawgiver, and par- ticularly with the tradition of such a pavement having been the \"pattern\" exhibited upon the holy mount and alluded to in Exodus xxiv, 10, \"And they saw the God of Israel ; and the place under his feet was like a paved work, of brilliant sapphire, and like the color of heaven in clearness .\" There are two eminently Masonic allusions in this verse, one to the pavement, and the other to the blue color, which has always been symbolic of the Hermetic philosophy ; whence our \"Blue\" lodge, for instance . As we might well be astonished rit the frequent Biblical references to Deity in language that might be applied to a gigan- tic man, we must seek an explanation for them in the well authen- ticated philosophy of the ancients, to the effect that the Universe really was the great first-created man, who, being the pattern established by God and termed the Macrocosmos or \"great har- mony,\" was reproduced in multitude of the microcosmos or \"lesser harmony .\" Every fiber of the being of each individual comprised in the latter class was an emanation or duplication in miniature of the stupendous original model . The language of Freemasonry cleverly conceals these ancient conceptions, 'be- cause ancient initiation revealed them in detail .

The importance attached to cere- monial processions round land that it was intended to consecrate to some sacred employment, about edifices to be dedicated or cities to be destroyed, is amply set forth in Holy Writ and classi- cal lore . As a wall or hedge might surround or inclose something set apart for special reasons, so the mysticism of our forefathers im- agined it possible to erect unseen spiritual barriers round objects or persons, which, according to .the character of the accompany- ing incantations, would confine or exclude the powers of Light or Darkness as desired . The pantheons of nearly all ancient peoples were personifi- cations of the celestial bodies and of the constellations that served to mark the zodiacal signs and other divisions . Elaborate spectacles were therefore devised to mystify the \"profane\" and edify the initiates, which exhibited the movements of the sun, moon and planets among the fixed stars, especially accentuating their positions at important periods . The Sun was ever deity and king, while the hero and martyr of the various mysteries seems to have been the planet Mercury . This latter has a triple aspect, made much use of .

Mercury's circumambulations of the zodiac in one solar year are four ; but they are symbolically limited to three, because, while this planet \"rises above\" and \"falls below\" the sun with each of its revolutions, as a mythological personage three of these falls are characterized as due to the attack of an enemy, while the fourth, occurring close to the winter solstice, was accounted a burial, the subsequent rise from which was a resurrection . A grave error has possessed many commentators on the ancient mysteries in taking the figure of the slain hero (Adonis, Tammuz, Dionysus, etc .) to be the sun . The sun was the Supreme Being to all the ancient peoples, who, though he veiled his face in anger with storms, and removed himself afar in winter, never either died naturally or was slain . The proximity of Mercury to the sun carries that planet wherever the sun goes ; hence the frequent confusion . Old Babylonian cylinder seals frequently show this final fall of Mercury between the pillars of the west with the sun- god stretching forth his hand to resuscitate him, while personi- fications of the three planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars look on accompanied by their respective attributes of water, air, and fire .

Students of astrology will remark the fact that they are the rulers of the whole six astrological houses (signs of the Zodiac) from Scorpio to Aries, therefore governing the winter season . This is very different above the equator from that below, and so we must expect conceptions of its ruling planets widely differ- ent in the north from the tropics, and especially through the ages when the depth of winter lay in Pisces, a \"house\" of Saturn .

We must conceive of the universe as a whole, a gigantic being of mind, parts, and functions, so analogous to our own that we can perceive what is meant by man's being \"created in God's own image .\" All this, to the ancients, was the manifestation of an ultimate and unmanifested power . The animating force of this vast harmony was the Sun, distributing its creative and ener- gizing impulses by means of radiant light, and as this light car- ried with it the intelligence requisite to the due performance of its varied tasks, an active intelligence was deemed to reside with- in the luminous solar envelop, which (the manifestation, Word, or Logos of the unmanifested God) created and sustained the world and all living organisms . This Word was the great and sacred four-lettered word of the Hebrews, JHVH . It can be proved by countless circumstances that JHVH was the secret God of the whole ancient world ; only the Hebrews divested Him of the idolatrous, and often licentious and obscene rites with which He was hailed by many pagan nations . The famous number-letter philosophies of the ancient world were means by which JHVH was shown to be the source of every hu- man science and contemplation . As the planets shone with light borrowed from the central sun, so they were, as subordinate gods, spirits or archangels, but the distributors for the central intelli- gence, whom the Chaldean Magi called IAO, the Heptaktis, or seven-rayed god .

The four cardinal signs being the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh, 2+5+8+11 equaling 26, so these four signs represent the revealed word of God, in Christian symbology, as the symbols of the four Evangelists, taken from thee visions of Ezekiel and Daniel .

To the ancient Seer, the universe stood as a concrete visible edifice with limits, bounds, and dimensions . That which he did not see had no existence, and consequently, as a realm of nothing- ness, beyond the region of the fixed stars, was accepted as per- fectly reasonable ; for out of that same \"nothing\" had not the tangible universe been achieved in \"six day\"? The vast number of measures and dimensions with which Holy Writ is crowded, nay the very association of square and compasses with the sacred volume upon our altar, are testimony of what men once believed concerning the limited and measurable character of the universal Temple, made comprehensible by geo- metry . The earthly Temple was the means given by which man, the lesser universe, a creature connected by invisible cords with and swayed by every superior power enthroned in the Cosmos, with God as Ruler, both above and below, might duly com- prehend his importance in the scale of creation and real- ize that he was himself no less the Temple of the Holy Spirit than the heavens above were the Temple of Almighty God .

The basic arithmetical quantities of the geometry of self-existent proportions found in nature are the numbers 3, 4, and 5, which, in their simplest combination, con- stitute the wonderful triangle of our ancient brother Pytha- goras . That which we call an operative Mason's square is as com- pletely natural a figure as the triangle in question, because in addition to its definition of the angle of 90 degrees, the fourth part of a circle, it also lays out the two most important oblongs, those of 3 by 4 and 4 by 5, the angles of which are defined by the dotted lines b-d and a-c .

The moment that this proportion is recognized the outline of the trowel becomes the geometrical basis of the emblematic square and compasses themselves, and the line be- tween the extreme points has the value of the letter Jod, the initial of the name of God in Hebrew . As Jod represents Spirit acting upon Matter, causing its inchoate particles to cohere in shapely proportions, so the trowel is the instrument employed - by master masons to unite fragmentary building material upon symmetrical and orderly plans .

This is not, however, the fact . The great significance of the Lion in all manner of symbolic associations dates from the first inception of the zodiacal system of measuring the heavens and timing the great astronomical cycles, which appointed the sign of a Lion, the fiercest and most redoubtable of beasts, as that of the summer solstice, the moment of the year's most ardent solar vigor . Speaking as astrologers are wont to express these things, the sign of the Lion is the \"House of the Sun,\" and the terms have thus come to be practically synonymous . It is interesting to Masons who carry the \"Lion of the tribe of Judah\" as one of the armorial quarterings of their \"Royal Arch\" banner and on the seals of many Grand Lodges to know that the current Ma- sonic date is arrived at by adding the number of years B . C . (ap- proximately, the true number being 399 .5) at which the summer solstice entered the sign of the Lion to the year A . D . in which we happen to be . The truest manner of carrying on the calendar is by means of the slow movement of the equinoctial points round the circle of the ecliptic, which accounts for every instant of time without the necessity of computing leap years and extra months ; but in the course of time these points inevitably passed through and out of given signs into their neighbors', which occasioned great confusion, as each time this occurred a disturbance of religious symbolisms with which people had been familiar for several thou- sand years ensued . In all the cases of which we have record such changes have been made the basis of new religious conceptions which have effected universal revolutions . The change from the Lion to Crab in B .

The God of Israel was the mathematical center of the universe, the point within the circle of the ecliptic, which was supposed to be its outer edge, and His symbolism resided in the \"four beasts,\" which still constitute the arms of the fraternity,-the Lion, Eagle, Bull, and Man, referred to in the first chapter of Ezekiel . These are the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh signs, their numbers adding to 26, that of the \"Great and Sacred Name\" JHVH (Jehovah) . (See Frontispiece .) We have frequently had to re- fer to this number 216 in the course of these papers as the sum of the cubes of 3, 4 and 5 and of the num- ber 6 . It is the basis of the ancient names for \"man\" and \"woman .\" \"IshU and IshAH,\" and is one of the most important numbers of the Hebrew Kabbalah, in the depths of which lie buried the nature secrets of which the Thorah gives only the external hints . The prevalence of this Lion-Eagle-Bull-Man symbol all over the ancient world is proof positive of the contention of the Israel- ites that at one time all the peoples of the earth worshipped the true God, but with the exception of themselves fell into idolatry . India, Persia, Babylonia, Assyria, Phenicia, and Egypt all employed these figures in various ways, but especially that of the Lion, which, representing the Sun, was adopted as the symbol of divinely bestowed royalty . The name of King Solomon, whose throne was approached through an avenue of 12 lions, was composed of the letters S-L--M-N, which as 60-30 10 50 represented the lion cube 2160 .

The mystifying dis- crepancies raised by this curious statement of one of the world's greatest investigators of ancient lore are likewise typical of the vast confusion pertaining to almost everything Masonic ; due to the acceptance of theological dogma as authentic history, with- out analysis as to the origin and purport of the various legends that perpetually clash along the road of time . If we will but regard the wonderful old Hebrew legends as versions of age-old nature myths which achieved expression in analogous legends among other and neighboring Semitic peoples, we shall come closer to historical truth . There is a reason, lying away back at the dawn of human culture for getting Adam and Eve and Noah mixed . This reason cannot be imagined by taking the characters as historical personages, as described in the later writing of the book of Genesis . One must revert to the ancient speculative doctrine of the archetypal, androgynous man, called by the Phenicians \"Adam Kadmon,\" for the true elucidation . These are big and hard words to most of us ; but they are the keys to explanations that will be found in good encyclopedias . Another Assyriologist, translating tablets, announced not long ago that Noah was \"a lady\" ; which seems to make it still worse . Nevertheless there is still a bottom to the mystery, or rather series of connected mysteries ; for it is all part of an iden- tical system in the meshes of which we are still unwittingly en- tangled . The standard Masonic references to the acacia are princi- pally those of Mackey, who identifies it with the shittim wood of Scripture (from which gum arabic is obtained), and of Pike, who says it is the erica or thorny tamarisk .

The fact is that in ancient mythos there is quite a body of arboreal legends, and in the course of time a number of these have become mired or distorted to fit trees more familiar to cer- tain districts than to those where they originated . The Garden of Eden contained two notable trees, the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil . Both of these have become irretrievably mixed among those ignorant of the origin of either . The \"Garden of Eden\" arose from the ancient Sumerian legend concerning the origin of God's own people -i . e . . the Sumerians them- selves-in the valley of the Eu- phrates . The ancient name of Baby- lon was Tin-Tirki (\"Place of the Tree of Life\"), and the country round it was called Kar (or Gan) Diinyash (the \"Garden of Dunyash\") or Adon Yesha (the Builder of the Universe), eventually to be called Dionysius or Bacchus . Critical analysis of the Baby- lonian \"Tree of Life,\" which is depicted in countless archeo- logical remains, shows it to be a representation of the sun and twelve signs of the Zodiac dis- played as what are called \"pal- mettes,\" a fan-shaped figure copied from a palm tree motif .

The character of the evergreen shrub varies according to locality ; but the myth is everywhere the same . As philosophy progressed, the myriad ramifications of trees suggested mathematical processes, and the conical shape of the conifers, the equilateral triangle of the geometer, and so we find the Angel of the Lord, in the burning bush, paralleled by the head of Ahura-llazda, in the midst of 10 flames, arranged as a Pythagorean tetrax, on the Persian fire altars of Sassanian times. So there is also an intimate analogy between the Christ- mas tree and the 36 C'Hanukah candles of the Israelite . To go back to the question of Adam as the archetypal man, the finest remnant of the old original story that remains to us is one begun in the Talmud and embroidered on by the Byzantine Christians of the time of Constantine . It is as follows \"When Adam died, his son Seth, before burying him, placed a seed of the Tree of Life, this time the thorny tamarisk, on his tongue . The seed sprouted, burst through the coffin, and grew into a stately tree . When, centuries later, the Roman soldiers were looking for a suitable tree from which to construct the Cross of Calvary, they happened on this particular one, cut it down, and made it the instrument of death . As any object employed in an execution was abhorrent, the crosses were subsequently buried in the spot where the tree had stood, where they remained until the time of Emperor Constantine the Great . \"The mother of this emperor, the pious Helena, dreamed that the spot was revealed to her by heavenly visitants, and thereupon prevailed on her son to send an expedition to Jeru- salem to recover the sacred relic . Constantine was so sure of success that he caused beacons to be placed on hilltops all the way from Constantinople to Jerusalem, around his dominions in Asia Minor, to signal back the news of the discovery . \"Singularly enough, it all happened just as Constantine, Helena, and their monkish counselors had figured out . They found the precise locality, disinterred the three crosses, and in the course of excavations also recovered the skull of Adam .\" This adventure, called in Romish annals the \"Invention of the Cross,''-and never was a word better adapted to express the truth, is commemorated by the placing of a tiny skull and"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"1 20 \t TSE BEGINNING OF MASONRY crossbones at the base of the Roman Catholic crucifix ; but the Greek church displays it, at the foot of its crucifixes, not only the skull, but a sprig of acacia . It was from this Adam's skull tradition that the name Golgotha (\"Place of the Skull\") was derived . Brother Albert Pike tells us, in \"Morals and Dogma\" that the \"Crown of Thorns\" was of this same thorny tamarisk tree . Now another connection must be sought in an old Jewish cabal- istic legend also in the Talmud . The latter says that the name \"Adam\" was spelled \"A-D-M,\" because it thus contained the initials of three successive incarnations of the same spiritual ego, i . e . . Adam-David-Messiah . While the facts prove this to be a late rabbinical hypothesis, because the premises are wrong, it nevertheless demonstrates the legendary identity of the archety- pal man of primitive legend, the Adam Kadmon, with David, who is Thoth, Hermes, or Mercury, and the Messiah, together with the mediaeval notion of an Acacia tree marking the spot where the last should rise from the grave of the first ."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Masonic Symbolism of Color* The subject of color in connection with Masonry is one which has received very little attention from students, in the past, but it is nevertheless one which is susceptible to some extremely fascinating speculations .

From the latter con- sideration we derive various notes of blue in lodge regalia and decorations . The Green of the Acacia, though not dwelt upon, supplies the final note on Immortality . In Capitular Masonry, the prevailing color is Red and much weight is given to the colors of the four Veils, respectively Scarlet, Blue, Purple and White, which are self-evidently repre- sentations of those employed in the Tabernacle and subsequent Temples of Israel .

The Egyptians, who manufactured col- ored glass and must have made experiments with light, observing that red and green produced black, made these three colors repre- sentative of the J, V . and H . of their secret Supreme Being, HUHI, who was none other than our mighty Jehovah .

Bezaleel and Aholiab, builders of the Tabernacle in the Wild- erness, were \"filled with wisdom of heart to execute all manner of work of the engraver, and of the designing weaver and of the embroiderer in blue, and in purple and in scarlet yarn and in linen thread .\" The gold, silver and copper employed were respectively sacred to the Sun, Moon and Planet Venus, while the Onyx stone and Shittim or Acacia wood, so lavishly employed, were symbols of the planet Mercury, which, to them, became the \"Angel of the Lord,\" Raphael . The celebrated Tyrian Architect, builder of King Solomon's Temple, is likewise described as skillful to work in gold, in silver, in copper and in iron n,in stone, in wood, in purple, in blue, in fine linen and in crimson and also to execute any manner of engraving-again a list of symbolic materials embracing the metals of the Sun, Moon, Venus and Mars, the last two indic- ative of the physical qualities of Attraction and Repulsion, which engender the Vibration which Science is even now identi- fying as the great cosmic energy .

If, finally, a most delightful theory may be advanced, we would (in our recognition of the advancement of the ancient Seers in many branches of Art and Science which we have only tardily come to justly credit them with), like to presume that part of the universal adoration of Light as the dwelling place of the Deity and the primordial source of substance employed in material creation, consisted in an appreciation of color, as a property of light . We are perfectly satisfied, that the seven prismatic colors were recognized in the earliest ages of the civilized World . We know that the ancients were acquainted with the manufacture of glass and that in possession of this latter substance, they could scarcely avoid something which is constantly occurring to the astonishment of children, handling glass or crystal in the sunlight, the production of the colors of the rainbow . Why, then, were four colors only selected for the symbols of Matter and the Veils, representing the Elements by our ancient Brethren? All scientists have heard of Wollaston's celebrated experiment, performed in 1891 for the purpose of discovering the ultimate composition of light . We quote the language of his paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of Great Britain in 1802 . He says \" .I cannot conclude my observations on the dispersion of light without remarking that the colours, into which a beam of white light is separable by refraction, appear to me to be neither seven, as they are usually seen in the Rainbow, nor reducible by any means, that I can find to three, as some persons have con- ceived, but that by employing a very narrow pencil of light four primary divisions of the prismatic spectrum may be seen with a degree of distinctness, that I believe has not been de- scribed or observed before .\" \"If a beam of daylight be admitted into a dark room by-a crevice, 1-20 of an inch broad, and received by the eye at a distance of ten or twelve feet through a prism of flint glass, free from veins, held near the eye, the beam is seen separated into the four following colors only : Red, a yellowish Green (which might pass as a muddy White), Blue and Violet .\" The very diagram employed by Wollaston to illustrate this experiment, a human eye viewing the four ultimate colors through a triangular prism, suggests above all things the notion of the all-seeing eye, in the Triangle, viewing His Creation as a compound of the four elements, only known to and symbolized by ancient science .

Superficially the term Light may be deemed to apply solely to the intellectual enlightenment of one who has hitherto been grop- ing in mental obscurity, with reference to the great questions of man's origin, being, and destiny . This is not, however, altogether the case . It is often a ques- tion as to whether the average initiate in these days emerges from his round of ordeals otherwise than gratified that they are over and that he has gained a right to the coveted fellowship with the elect . There is a significance in the word bight and its fullest inter- pretation, that far transcends any ordinary sense ; for the true promise of \"light in Masonry\" is the return of man unsullied to the pure source of his being . Thousands of years before Sir Isaac Newton declared light to be \"a subtile form of matter\" it was universally accepted as the source of all that was good and beneficent in physical nature . All that exists was deemed to be the product of either the lumin- ous principle in which resided the Godhead, or of the principle of darkness, equally substantial, which waged continual war upon it . In all the ancient philosophies these two inimical substances engendered and were peopled by beings that partook of their several natures . Man, according to ancient tradition, was origi- nally one of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Light, and the home story of our first parents, notwithstanding the long-cher- ished notion of a geographical location for their original site, was among the stars, where they named and presided over the ani- mal-shaped contellations as spirits . The bodies of these were composed entirely of the luminous substance .

Through this admixture of light and darkness the material world came into existence, and the male and female principle de- rived from JHVH were driven from the Kingdom of Light to this intermediate region of earth, on which they thenceforth must dwell, \"clad in garments of skin\" ; i . e ., in bodies of human flesh . From that time onward the human soul, according to the intention of the beautiful old Eastern allegory . has been seeking to regain its lost estate ever driven and tempted by the powers of darkness seek- ing to drag it down to complete and final destruction . We hear less of this story of the connection of Freemasonry with that of the \"Fall of Man\" than was once the case, when this feature was embodied in the necessary lectures . The candidate, in seeking light, is but seeking his origi- nal state of physical innocence, moral in- tegrity, and wisdom . We have in many ways shown that the theater of his en- deavors, divested of its cabalistic terms, is our own universe . With this conception ever in view, and remembering the can- didate to be the Ego, or self-conscious principle in man, it is easy to follow his spiritual experiences, from the cradle to the ever- green strewn grave, in search of - the talismanic word that shall restore his forfeited birthright . It is the Kingdom of Light and the rescue of the body of Light, the original and self-sufficient envelop of the soul, that is the' constant object of his search along the rugged road that he is compelled to tread, in quest for the outstretched hand of Him who alone, is able to raise this body from the encumbering matter . The symbols placed along his path, which at suitable times are interpreted to him, are age-old devices for revealing the mys- terious connection between spirit and matter . The symbolisms of \"direction,\" taken from the points of the compass, . in which the . solstices and equinoxes were situated at the moment of the inception of the Ancient Mysteries, have served to fix the Celestial East of the summer solstice in the sign of the Lion, as the home and source of perfect light ; while its antithesis, the portal of the West, associated with the annual Initiation in ancient Egypt ."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"1 26 \t THE BEGINNING OF MASONRY death of Nature, assailed by the blasts of winter, at that solstice, was the station of death, darkness, and dissolution .
