A few manifest typographical errors have been corrected. The publisher’s introduction from that edition is omitted for copyright reasons. Layout and style from the print edition has been retained, although no attempt has been made to match the typeface. Carlile’s exposure was originally pr inted by instalments in a radical magazine called The Republican in 1825. An earlier book version was issued in 1831. Over the course of successive publications, Carlile’s com- mentaries were revised significantly. Carlile, with a background in working- class activism and radical publish ing, which included several years of imprisonment for issuing “blasphemo us” writings (specifically Thomas Paine’s Age of Reason ), initially attacked Free masonry from a materialist and anti-religious point of view, dismi ssing the pretensions of the fraternity to fantastical antiquity and denouncing its social influence as pernicious. In subsequent editions of the exposure, as Carlile shifted his views on the subject under various influ ences, his commentaries were rewritten, firstly reflecting the idea that Freemasonry derived from ancient solar cults (this idea perhaps derived from Thomas Paine’s Essay on Free Masonry , but it reflects a more general intellectual fa shion of the period to explain all manner of religions in terms of solar myths, as reflected in the works of Jacob Bryant, Godfrey Higgins, and o thers) and interpreting its teachings in terms of astronomical mythology (apparently under the influence of Robert Taylor, a former Anglican clergyman, nicknamed ‘The Devil’s Chaplain,’ with whom Carlile associat ed after his release from prison in 1825), and finally emphasising the moral teachings of the craft. (Carlile later fell out with Taylor and delete d a reference to him in his “introd- uctory Key-stone to the Royal Arch”; in the earlier version, Carlile tells us that he claimed to Godfrey Higgins tha t he and Taylor were the third and fourth Freemasons in England.)

I am of opinion, that nothing useful to be known should be made a secret, and that there is nothin g of the kind a secret among mankind. I hold, that the mere profession of having such a secret is a vice. The question reasonably arises, why should it be a secret? Of Freemasons, I boldly say, that they have no secret; but there is a secret co nnected with their association, and they have not known it. The late Godfrey Higgins once observed to me, without explanat ion, that there were but two Masons in England—himself and the Duke of Sussex. I put in a claim to be a third. He asked me to explain, on the con- dition that he was not to commit himself by any observation. I did so, as here set forth. He smiled and withdrew. The secret is now out. I will clea r up the doubt and difficulty and teach Masonry to Masons. The following forms of opening, working, and closing lodges are literally and truly the form ularies of the three common de- grees in Masonic Lodges, or that secret system which is called Craft Masonry. It has been co mmunicated to me by Masons; it has been confirmed by other Masons; it has been the Stan- dard Manual of Masonry, since it was first published in “The Republican,” in 1825; it has made many Masons without the lodge initiation, and, by its direction, I have been assured"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION iv that men who were never in a lodge have successfully and pro- fitably taught practical masonry. The higher degrees form the subject of other volumes. They are not common; are denominated orders of chivalry ; and but very few Masons go beyond the Royal Arch Degree. The great subject of Masonry is Solomon’s Temple. The two first secret words are Boaz and Jachin , the pillars of the porch of that temple. Through all the Masonic degrees, ancient or modern, the subject continues to be a dark development of the building of the temple. I am ab out to throw light upon it. My historical researches have taught me that that which has been called Solomon’s Temple never ex isted upon earth : that a na- tion of people called Israelites never existed upon earth : and that the supposed history of Is raelites and their temple is nothing more than an allegory relating to the mystery of physics generally, and the moral culture of the human mind. Hence the real secret of masonry. The word temple is derived from the Latin word tempus , time; and, therefore, the ancient structures called temples were in reality intended to be record s of time and archives of human knowledge. Such institutions would have been a great benefit to mankind ; but the veil of su perstition was thrown over them ; it was deemed politic or profitable to the few to deceive the many ; that which should ha ve been a simple record of fact was worked up into an alle gory : there arose an esoteric doctrine for those initiated in the secrets of the temple, and a deceptious exoteric doctrine fo r the multitude; and this was the origin of a priesthood ; th is the lamentable change from science to priestcraft ; this the secret of Freemasonry, the key of the mysteries of the Christ ian religion, and the basis of Judaism. Judaism, Christianity, and Freemasonry, are, in principle, one and the same, as to secret origin and mystery. Let us endeavour to turn the stre am ; to go from priestcraft to science, from mystery to knowle dge, from allegory to real history."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION v But for planetary motion, there could have been no division of time. The relations of the su n to the planets and fixed stars make up all the natural division s of time; such as the day, the month, the year, and the corresponding seasons. The day is marked by the motion of the earth on its own axis. The month (lunar) by the appearances of the moon; and (solar or calendar) by the grouping of stars into twelve divisions, which are called the Zodiac, pict orially marked by signs, and seen opposite to the solar side of the earth, in the successive months. The year is complete when the sun appears to re- turn to a given spot from which it is said to start. The polar motions of the earth cause the sun to appear in a state of birth, growth, maturity, decay, and death, in the course of a year, producing our seasons. These appearances have been poetically allegorized and personified; and hence all that has been invented about god or gods , about new born god, living god, dying god, descending god, resurrection god, ascending god. There is no plain historical trut h, no revelation, about god, in existence, other than those of the relations of the sun to the planets and stars, in physics, and the cultivation of the human mind in morals. All other such pretensions to history may be historically disproved. We ar e prepared with historical dis- proofs of the existence of such a pe ople as Israelites or Jews as a nation. They were a religiou s or philosophical sect, who had been made adepts in the higher Pagan Mysteries : a sect among nations ; but not a nation among sects. Our common temples, like those of the ancients, have gene- rally, and only with a few modern exceptions, been built due east and west, in respect to the rising and setting of the sun. The steeples have been conical emblems of flame, which is again emblematical of the sun. Etymology will carry every word connected with religion back to primitive sun-worship, and mental cultivation. The em blems of the most ancient tem- ples of which we have ruins, are emblems of time, of plane- tary bodies, their motions and re lations, and of sun-worship,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION v i &c. It is therefore calling fo r no great stretch of the imagi- nation, for no strange credulity, to call for the admission that the first temples were dedica ted to the sun ; that the first principles of religion consisted of a scientific record of the sun’s annual path through the signs of the Zodiac, with other then known science ; and that the first efforts of priestly and cunning men would be to de ceive the vulgar upon this subject, to preach the reality of the personified god, which science forbad, and the existenc e of which the principles of matter or of nature rendered impossible. When man began to make God like himself, he began also to give God a dwelling-place, such as he found or could make on earth. The first temples that were imagined by ingenuity were temples in the heavens, time marked by planetary parti- tions. Thus we read of the New Jerusalem , coming down from heaven as a dwelling-place for the saints of the earth. The seven churches of Asia were seven imaginary temples in hea- ven, reduced to a figurative tale , and then imitated on earth. Thus again that which is called the building of the first Solo- mon’s Temple never took place on earth ; but the story of the temple was fabricated; and the fi rst Jewish historian we have (Josephus) allows that it was a llegorical and emblematical of the universe, or of all the ph ysical phenomena. The true meaning, then, of the building of Solomon’s temple, in Free- masonry is, and the practice of the lodges should be, to the effect that the grand secret of all religion is this allegorical typification of the solar relati ons and planetary motions with mental and moral cultivation, and that such, in truth, is the great lost secret of Freemasonry . The masons have lost the initiatory secret—have been nu mbered among the vulgar, and deceived with the exoterical doctrine of personified deity. Mr. Paine had a glimmering ligh t on this subject, but he was ignorant of the details. He made a shrewd guess at the thing, and guessed rightly as to a part of the principle, though"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION vi i he could not fill out the histor y and origin. The esoterical principle of Freemasonry, and of Christianity and of Judaism, is SUN-WORSHIP AND SCIENCE, AS THE BASIS OF HUMAN CULTURE AND DISCIPLINE, the common Paganism of the Hunan race. Mr. Paine guessed at this in relation to Freemasonry, but knew it not in relation to Christianity and Judaism. I purpose to furnish here nothing more than the Key-stone to the Arch of Freemasonry, which is the moral and gist of the Royal Arch Degree, at which Masons have played, not worked , without knowing what they were about. For a further proof that I present the right ke y, I refer the reader to the theologico-astronomical, or Sund ay evening discourses, at the Rotunda, of the Rev. Robert Ta ylor. They are so many phi- losophical lectures on masonr y, though the exposure profes- sedly relates to Christianity. They form two volumes of a cheap publication, entitled “The Devil’s Pulpit.” I refer him also to the works of Dupuis, Volney, Sir. William Drummond, and Rhegellini. Masons claim Pythagoras as one of their fraternity. They may also claim every Grecian and Roman sage, who sought out the Pagan mysteries. But the Modern Masons are not very worthy disciples of those ancient men. The proper business of a Mason is astronomical, chemical, geological, and moral science, and more particularly that of the ancients, with all the mysteries and fables founded upon it. A good Mason would, in fact have no superstition. It should be his boast, that his science takes him out of modern religion. He who can build So lomon’s Temple, in the alle- gorical sense, is disqualified from being a fanatic. Deism has been charged upon, and even bo asted of, by modern Masons ; but as a sect, they are innocent of any science that can take them out of the common impre ssions of modern religious doctrines."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION vii i Astrology, gipsy fortune telling, Modern Freemasonry, Mahometanism, Christianity, and Judaism, now so called, have sprung from, and are so many corruptions of, the ancient mysteries of the Pagans. Star-gazing, without proper human culture, has been the source of all religion. Lunacy is a dis- order improperly ascribed to Luna, or the Moon ; for moon- struck madness had never befallen any one who had not been corrupted in education, and had the brain badly cultivated. The first professions of Christ ianity, as visible in the New Testament, were professed reve lations of the ancient Pagan mysteries ; but, as a revelation, it was a failure—and it would have been better if the ancient Paganism had not been super- seded by the grosser mysteries th at have, in ignorance, been adopted, of the God’s-spell or gospel. However, let them all now re pent, for the kingdom of hea- ven is at hand, and the key wi ll be freely given to anyone who will unlock and enter. That there was no such a nation as the Israelites, is a truth —found in the consideration th at they are not mentioned be- yond the Bible in any records whatever. Egypt knew them not, Persia knew them not, Hind oostan knew them not, Scythia knew them not, Phœnicia knew them not, Greece knew them not, as a nation. And in the firs t general notice that we have of the Jews, they are introduced to the world as a sect, or a series of sects, being Pharisees , Sadducees, and Essenes ; and in that general notice, beyond th at sort of mistaken allegorical history which Josephus has copi ed from the books of the Old Testament, and which is not otherwise corroborated, and no better authority than the book of the Old Testament, there is no presentation of the Jews as the descendants of a larger nation of Israelites ; as a religi ous or philosophical sect of dis- tinction, mixed up with, and found in real human history, they are not to be traced high er than the century before the Christian era. It is satisfactory to be able to show the origin"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION ix of anything, for such a knowledge is a common passion and curiosity among mankind ; and I think the Rev. Robert Tay- lor has discovered and developed the origin of the titles of Hebrew , Israelite , and Jew . The Eleusinian mysteries were Pagan; the same in relation to Isis in Egypt, as to Ceres in Greece, and continued in rela- tion to the Virgin Mary, as a part of the mistaken Christian mystery. It is the fault of Freemasonry, that it has had no- thing feminine belonging to it ; the ladies make no part of its mysteries, and to the ladies it has been a matter of great un- easiness. They very naturally, and very properly, suspect the propriety of all exclusively male association. The Jews have nothing feminine in their religion . No religion has provided a paradise, or future happy state, for earthly women. They should be all infidels of course. The modern construction and mistaken reading, under what is called the Christian Religion, has become a great burlesque on them. The word Eleusis is the Greek of Adve ntus, the Latin, the Advent, of the Christian mystery; and signifies THE COMING (emphatically), and literally, the coming of light. The story of the transfiguration on the mount, in the New Tes- tament, is an imperfect descript ion of the holding of a Lodge of association in the highest degr ee of the Eleusinian mystery. The Lodge was held by Peter, James, and John, or the per- sonified months of January, Apri l, or June, July, and August. The degrees of Freemasonry are allegorical of the same mys- tery. The very miracles of th e New Testament are allegorical sketches of the different degrees of the same mysteries. The turning of water into wine is th e process of vinous vegetation, and one of the mysteries of Bacchus, who was also that light which was to come , the Messiah; the Sun, in physics, or the physical saviour ; the Logos, Chri st, or principle of Reason ; as the moral saviour. The marri age of Cana, in Galilee, was the marriage supper of the Lamb ; the spring of the year ;"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION x the midway between the watering -pot of Aquarius, or watery season, and the ripening of the grape. “Woman,” said Jesus to his mother, “what have I to do with thee? My time is not yet come.” Summer and autumn are the time of Bacchus. But he turned the water into wine, and so he does every year. The feeding of the multitude with 8 few small loaves and fishes is a mystery significant of the pr olific power in the earth in the growth of corn, and of the wate r in the production of fishes. The curing of diseases, of lameness and blindness, casting out devils, allaying a storm, wa lking on the water, the resur- rection of the dead, and the asce nsion into heaven, are all so many solar mysteries or allegorica l relations of the sun’s action upon the earth, figured with an association of scientific and moral powers in man. The sacrament of the Lord’s Sup- per is the joint mystery of th e union of Ceres and Bacchus— the Pagan producers of corn, or bread and wine, which are truly, in an allegorical, physical sense, the real body and blood of Christ. We shall find that Freemasonry has been a cor- rupted continuation of all those mysteries ; and that the Ma- sons have really, as they confess they have, lost their own secret. Let us see what learning can do to restore it to them. Much of the ritual of our church , even of our English church, is but a misunderstood contin uation and corruption of the words and ceremonies of the ancient Pagan mysteries. The Rev. Mr. Taylor, has beautifully explained this in his dis- courses. I have only room to glance at it here. The scenes and characters of th e mysterious drama, as found in the Eleusinian Orgies of Greece, were:— ELEUSIS—The Advent, or coming -in of light ; the birth and character of the subject of the drama—the title of the whole play or mystery. HIEROPHANT—The Expounder of the mysteries, the High Priest, the Pope, the Archbishop."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION x i HUPEREET—The Minister or Ordinary Priest. DIACONOS—The Deacon, or Lower Officer. DIADOCHOS—The Torch-Bearer. PHOTAGOGUE—The Bringer-in of Light. AUTOPTOS—The Candidate admi tted to see the sight. The visitor of the Temple—the Church and Chapel goer. AUTOPSY—The sight itself. HEBREW—The initiated Candidate who had passed through all the degrees of the mystery. TELEIOS—The adept, or perfected. ISRAELITE—God-seer, purified from all guile. JEW—The God himself, or the mysterious perfection and deification of the human character. The whole a type of what may be made of human nature by cultivation of mind, which is the conditional promise of para- dise, or kingdom of heaven. This is the revelation of all the mysteries. Hebrew , Israelite , and Jew , are Syriac, Phœnician, and Egyp- tian terms used in the mysterio us degrees; and it would be as reasonable to argue that th e Freemasons are a dispersed na- tion, as that the Jews are, or were, a dispersed nation. The modern religion of both Jew and Christian is a misunderstood and forgotten connection, corruption, and continuation, of the ancient Pagan mysteries. Freemas onry is a secret attempt of the same kind, but a failure. The word revelation , throughout the New Testament, signifies th e revealing of a mystery ; but until now, or speaking as far as we can see any record, the real mystery has never been revealed. The true revelation of God —the true gospel or word of Go d, is a revealing, that all the allegories and mysteries of reli gion refer to the sun as the physical God ; to the science of the human mind as the moral God. This was the secret of th e Eleusinian mysteries. That"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xi i is religious truth, and the whol e of religious truth ; and the placing of the church on such a rock, as against which the gates of hell shall not prevail. Freem asonry is but a professed con- cealment of the same revelation , and may be properly styled a bastard or illegitimate mystery. With this key in his hand, th e reader of the following M AN - UAL OF M ASONRY will gain more knowledge of M ASONRY as he proceeds, than M ASONS themselves gain in their Lodges. Not one of them has had sense and le arning enough to discover the real secret of the craft ; and I claim this circumstance as a proof that it is INFIDELITY , as modern criticism and science have been called— modern infidelity , which is really becoming the light of the world , which is the light, life, and knowledge needed , and which is morally, scientifically. and properly speak- ing, the true Eleusis or Advent , or HE THAT SHOULD COME. The sacred scriptures, or the books of the Old and New Tes- tament, were not written with an intention that they should be used as they are now used ; they were not intended to be translated into any vulgar language, and made the common- place book or text book of the mu ltitude, to be wrested, as St. Peter has forcibly observed, to their destruction—certainly to their injury ; but they are deep ly mysterious writings, not re- vealing, but concealing, and misrepresenting, the ancient mys- teries ; forming from them a new mode of association, and making a new religion of the ol d Pagan materials, precisely upon the principle that we now see one sort of secret association springing from another—the Odd Fellows, for instance, in re- lation to the Masons ; one sect of religious association spring- ing from another, through common ignorance and fanatical but mistaken conceit of spiritual kn owledge, as Quaker, Unitarian, and Methodist, springing from the Church of England, that from the Church of Rome, that from the Church of Greece or Egypt, those from the Persian, and the whole from the general"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xii i Pagan mysteries; and precisely upon the principle that one language is seen to emanate fr om another, all having a common root. In the first preaching of the alle gory of Christ crucified, there was no imposition ; there was a deeply laid and mysterious allegory, which the multitude took in its literal sense, and made for themselves a history from fict ion. So it has been with the addition and union of the book s of the Old Testament. The books of the Sibyls have been also supposed to be prophetic of the Christian religion : but the mystery is cleared up, when we find the root of the Christia n and of the Jewish in the Pagan system whence all those books were formed. A development of this kind is the one great th ing needful for universal brother- hood, which has not been found in Freemasonry, nor in Chris- tianity, nor in Judaism, yet or now so called. The Key, then, to the mysterie s of Freemasonry, as well as to the mysteries of the Christian and the Jewish religions, is the Eleusinian mysteries of the Pagan religion ; and the further Key to all those mysteries, is a worship of the Sun as God, under a variety of personifications, in all its Zodiacal transits, in the personification of the year , of the seasons, of the months, of time generally, and of all th e divisions of time, and as the source of all physical and all moral phenomena. The Masonic building of Solomon’s temple is the getting a knowledge of the celestial globe, knowing the my steries of all the figures and grouping of stars on that globe ; knowing further, that this globe is the foundation of all religion, knowing how to calcu- late the precession of the equin oxes, the return of comets and eclipses, and all the planetary motions and astronomical rela- tions of time. Such is not th e knowledge now gained in Ma- sonic Lodges; I will present the re ader with that knowledge ; but such should be the knowledg e ; for such would be real and useful knowledge. The ancient priests thought that knowledge should be concealed from the mult itude, or found it profitable"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xiv that it should be so ; and he nce our sacred and mysterious writings. But now, we do not think that knowledge should be kept from the multitude, an d hence our infidelity and our revealings. It may be well to mention here , that I am in possession of entire disproofs of the present pretended historical origination of the Christian religion; and I was in that possession, before I attempted to seek any other origin. I have long felt the necessity of tracing another or igin, and I now do so, in con- necting it with the ancient Paga n mysteries. On reading the New Testament, with the Key which I here present, and with the remembrance that, in relation to history, the book is alto- gether, from beginning to ending , a fiction; and on reading the Old Testament in the same way, there will remain on the mind something like knowledge gained from its mysterious matter ; but now, in the course of reading under the commonly received notions of it, and beyond its moral precepts, there is no knowledge gained. Such is the case with modern Freemasonry. I sum up these observations, with the conclusion that the Key Stone of the Royal Arch of Freemasonry is the ancient science of the Zodiac, with it s moral counter-part of human culture made mysterious in secr et and priestly associations; which is also the science of all religions that pretend to revela- tions ; and also of the religion of the Druids, and of all the Pagans from Hindostan to Rome. l have omitted all those remarks which, in the Nos. of the Vol. 12 of “The Republican,” mu st have been so offensive to Masons. My great object is here to instruct Masons as well as others, and not to give them offence. They ask for light. Here is light. They ask for fello wship. Here is the only basis of true and general fellowship. I see the evils of sectarianism among mankind, and I labour hard ; I endure persecution patiently, for the sole purpose of rooting out those evils.

Here we are, like other animals, for life, and nothing more ; and it will be wise if we so carry ourselves, as to enjoy the greatest possible amount of happiness, and to make it an essential and primitive point of that happiness, to inflict no pain on man, woman, child, or other animal. Howeve r unpleasant or objectionable this doctrine may be, in relation to present education, it is true ; and nothing opposed to it is true ; for we cannot alter the facts of nature ; we cannot change that which is immuta- ble ; though we may regulate ou r moral, we cannot regulate our physical, destiny. Necessity is less stern in morals than in physics, and in morals, is called liberty .

We have seen enough of the mischief of monarchy and priestcraft, of mys- tery, sectarianism, and secret societies. Let us now be open, or inquisitive, and be equal in knowledge. Any secret recipe for human disorder is but murder towards those who need it and cannot reach it.

A Lodge of Masons consists of the following officers: a Master who is styled Worshipful , and may be considered the President of the body. There are also Past Masters who have served as Masters, and are distingu ished as such in the Lodge.

When the Brethren are asse mbled to open a Lodge, the Master calls to order by giving a knock,* which is repeated by the Wardens, and the following dialogue begins : * In all ordinary affairs of the Lodge, as to call attention either by the Mas- ter, Tiler, or Inner Guard, one single ra p is made use of, but in opening, closing, &c., in the First or Entered Apprentice’s Degree, three distinct knocks are given:—in the Second or Fellow-Craft’s De gree, there is a distinction, and they are not given at equidistant time ; a pause being made after the first, and the two subsequently in quicker succession. And in the Third, or Master-Mason’s Degree, the pause is made between the se cond and third, the two first being given quickly, thus reversing the plan in the Fellow-Craft’s Degree.

M. then asks, What is the next care, Brother Senior Warden ? S. W. To see the Brethren appear to order as Masons. W. M. See that duty done. The Senior Warden examines any present if thought ne- cessary by the sign of an Entered Apprentice, and with the same sign reports to the W. M. that none but Masons are present. W. M.

May our labour, thus begun in or der, be conducted in peace, and closed in harmony. P. M. So mote it be. (The Past Master then advances three steps, opens the Bible at the —— Chapter of ——) and remains with his hand on it, until the ceremony finishes. W. M. Brethren, in the name of the Great Architect of the Universe I declare this Lodge duly opened, for the purposes of Masonry in the first degree. The W. M., S. W., J. W., I.

If any doubtful Brethren appear, they are made to take a new oath that they are real Masons, and that they have not been expelled from any Lodge. CEREMONY OF MAKING OR INITIATION , IN THE FIRST OR ENTERED APPRENTICE ’ S DEGREE . The Lodge being duly opened, and a. candidate applying for initiation, he has to sign a declaration, that he wishes to become a Mason : and on its being presented to the Lodge, and the candidate approved, which is generally done by ballot, a Brother, called the Stew ard, is sent out to prepare him in an antechamber. This preparation consists in the candidate being divested of all money and metal, of having the right arm, left breast, and le ft knee bare, the right heel slip-shod ; in being blindfolded, and a rope, which is tech- nically called a Cable Tow, is put round the neck, with a sword pointed to the breast. In this state, the Steward leads the candidate to the Tiler, or Outer Guard of the Lodge Door. The Tiler examines and sees the candidate properly prepared, and announ ces his approach by three knocks. The Inner Guard gives the alarm, and is ordered to ask who is there. The Steward or Tiler answers:— A poor candidate in a state of darkness, who comes of his own free will and accord, and also properly prepared, humbly "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 5 soliciting to be admitted to the mysteries and privileges of Freemasonry.

W. M. How does he hope to obtain those privileges ? I. G. By the help of God, being free born, and of good report. W. M. The tongue of good report has already been heard in his favour : do you, Brother Inner Guard, vouch that he is properly prepared ? I. G. I do. W. M. Then let him be admitted in due form. I. G.

Right glad I am to find your faith so well founded ; relying on such sure support, and since your trust is so firmly placed, you may safely rise and follow your leader with a firm but humble confidence ; for where the name of God is invoked, we trust no danger can ensue. The brethren from the North, East, South, and West, will take notice, that Mr. N—— is about to pass in view before them, to shew that he is a candidate pro- perly prepared, and a fit and proper person to be made a mason. He is then conducted round th e Lodge, for the view of the Brethren, and to see that he is properly prepared ; he is in- structed in the South and West by the Junior and Senior Wardens, and the J. D. gives three knocks on their shoulders, with the candidate’s hand, on which the demand who comes there ? is made ; to which the same answers are given as at the door ; and after their pronouncing, pass, free born and of good report, he is presented to the W. M. S. W. Worshipful Master, I present to you Mr. N——, a candidate properly prepared to be a mason. W. M. Brother Senior Warden, your presentation shall be attended to; for which purpose I shall address a few questions to the candidate, which trust he will answer with candour.— Mr. N——, do you seriously declare, on your honour, that, unbiassed by the improper solicita tions of friends against your own inclinations, and uninfluenced by mercenary or other un- worthy motives, you freely and voluntarily offer yourself a can- didate for the mysteries and privileges of Freemasonry ? Mr. N. I do. W. M. Do you likewise pledge yourself, that you are prompted to solicit those privileges from a favourable opinion preconceived of the institution, a general desire of knowledge, and a sincere wish to render yourself more extensively ser- viceable to your fellow-creatures ? Mr. N. I do. W. M. Do you further seriously declare on your honour that, avoiding fear on the one hand, and rashness on the other, you will steadily persev ere through the ceremony of your initiation, and, if once admitted, will afterwards act and abide by the ancient usages and established customs of the order ? Mr. N. I will. W. M. Brother Senior Warden , you will direct the Junior "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 7 Deacon to instruct the candidate to advance to the pedestal in due form. S. W. Brother Junior Deacon , it is the Worshipful Mas- ter’s command that you instruct the candidate to advance to the chair in due form. This form is by three irregular steps. W. M. Mr. N——, it is my duty to inform you, that Masonry is free, and requires a p erfect freedom of inclination in every candidate for its mysteri es. It is founded on the purest principles of piety and virtue. It possesses great and invaluable privileges to worthy men, and, I trust, to the worthy alone. Vows of fidelity are required ; but let me assure you, that in those vows, there is nothing incompatible with your civil, moral, or religious duties. Are you, therefore, willing to take a solemn obligati on, founded on the principles I have stated, to keep inviolat e the secrets and mysteries of the order ? Mr. N. I am. W. M. Then you will kneel with your left knee, keeping your right foot in the form of a square, place your right hand on this book, which is the volume of the sacred law, while, with your left, you will support one point of these compasses to your naked breast, so as not to hurt yourself, and then repeat the following obligation: I, Mr. N——, in the presence of the great Architect of the Universe, and of this warranted , worthy, and worshipful Lodge of free and accepted Masons, regularly assembled and properly dedicated, of my own free will and accord, do, hereby and hereon, most solemnly and sinc erely swear, that I will always hele, conceal, and never reveal, any part or parts, point or points, of the secrets and mysteri es of, or belonging to, free and accepted masons in masonry, wh ich have been, shall now, or hereafter may be, communicated to me, unless it be to a true and lawful brother or brothers, and not even to him or them, till after due trial, strict examination, or sure information from a well-known brother, that he or they are worthy of that confi- dence, or in the body of a just , perfect, and regular lodge of accepted Freemasons. I further solemnly promise, that I will not write those secrets, print, ca rve, engrave, or otherwise them delineate, or cause or suffer them to be done so by others, if in my power to prevent it, on any th ing moveable or immoveable "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 8 under the canopy of heaven, wh ereby or whereon any letter, character, or figure, or the least trace of a letter, character, or figure, may become legible or intelligible to myself, or to any one in the world, so that our secrets, arts, and hidden myste- ries, may improperly become known through my unworthiness. These several points I solemnly swear to observe, without eva- sion, equivocation, or mental res ervation of any kind, under no less a penalty, on the violation of any of them, than to have my throat cut across, my tongue torn out by the root, and my body buried in the sand of the sea at low water mark , or a cable’s length from the shore, where th e tide regularly ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours, or the more efficient punishment of being branded as a wilfully perjured individual, void of all moral worth, and unfit to be received in this warranted lodge, or in any other warranted lodge, or society of masons, who prize honour and virtue above all the external advantages of rank and fortune : So help me, God, and keep me steadfast in this my great and solemn obligation of an Entered Apprentice Free Mason. W. M. What you have repea ted may be considered a sa- cred promise as a pledge of your fidelity, and to render it a solemn obligation, I will thank you to seal it with your lips on the volume of the sacred law. ( Kisses the Bible .) W. M. Mr. N——, having been kept a considerable time in a state of darkness, what, in your present situation, is the most predominant wish of your heart ? Mr. N. Light. W. M. Brother Junior Deacon, let that blessing be restored to the candidate. The Junior Deacon removes the bandage from the eyes of the candidate. W. M. Having been restored to the blessing of material light, let me point out to your attention, what we consider the three great, though emblematic , lights in Masonry—namely, the Volume of the Sacred Law, the Square, and the Com- passes. The sacred volume is to rule and govern our faith : the square to regulate our actions : and the compasses to keep us within due bounds to all mankind, particularly with our brethren in Masonry. Rise, newly obli gated brother among masons. (He rises.) You are now enabled to discover the three lesser lights in Masonry. They are si tuated East, South, and West, "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 9 and are meant to represent the Sun, Moon, and Master of the Lodge. The Sun to rule th e day, the Moon to govern the night, and the Master to rude and direct his lodge. By your meek and candid beha viour this evening, you have escaped two great dangers ; but there is a third which will await you to the latest period of your existence. The dangers which you have escaped are those of stabbing and strangling ; for, at your entrance into the lodge, this sword was presented to your naked left breast, so th at, had you rashly attempted to rush forward, you would have been accessory to your own death by stabbing. Not so with the Brother who held it ; as he would have only remained firm to do his duty. There was likewise this Cable Tow, with a running noose about your neck, which would have rendered any attempt to retreat equally fatal by strangling. But the danger which will await you to your latest hour, is the penalt y of your obligation, that you would rather have your throat cut across, than to improperly divulge the secrets of Masonry. As you have taken the solemn obligation of Masonry, I am now permitted to inform you, that there are several degrees in Free- masonry, and peculiar secrets res tricted to each. These, how- ever, are not communicated indi scriminately, but are conferred on candidates according to merit and abilities. I shall now proceed to intrust you with the sign of this degree, or those marks by which we are known to each other and distinguished from the rest of the world. I must first premise, for your general information, that all squares, levels, and perpendicu- lars (alluding to the positions of the body and its limbs), are proper signs by which to know a Mason. You are, therefore, expected to stand perfectly erect, with your feet formed into a square, your body being thus considered an emblem of your mind, and your feet the rectitude of your actions. On your advancement from West to East , you advanced by three irre- gular steps; irregular from the situation you were then in, not knowing where you were then going ; but they allude to three more regular steps, namely, right lines and angles, morally teaching us upright live s and well-squared actions. You will now advance towards me by one pace with your left foot, bringing the right heel into its hollow.—That is the first regular step in Freemasonry; and it is in this position that the secrets of the degree are communi cated. They consist in a sign, a grip or token, and a word."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 10 You will place your right hand in this position (level, with the thumb extended in a square, towards the throat), and the thumb to the left of the windpipe. The sign is given by drawing the hand smartly across the throat, and dropping it to the side. This is in allusion to the penalty of the obligation ; implying, that, as a man of honour and a mason, you would rather have your throat cut across, than improperly di- vulge the secrets intrusted to you. That is the sign. The grip or token is given by a distinct pressure of the top of the right-hand thumb, of the first joint from the wrist, of the right-hand fore-finger, grasping the finger with the hand.* This demands a word, a word highly prized among masons, as the guard to their privileges : too much caution cannot, there- fore, be used in communicating it. It must never be given at length ; but always either by letters or syllables ; to enable you to do which, I must first te ll you what the word is. It is B OAZ . As in the course of the evening, you will be called on for this word, the Junior Deac on will now dictate the answers you are to give. Here the J. D. proceeds to instruct the candidate as to the common mode of salutation among masons. Giving him the grip, he asks— What is this ? Brother N. The grip or token of an Entered Apprentice Freemason. J. D. What does it demand ? B. N. A word. J. D. Will you give me that word ? B. N. At my initiation I was taught to be cautious ; I will letter or halve it with you, which you please, and begin. J. D. B. B. N. O. J. D. A. B. N. Z. J. D. This word is derived from the left-hand pillar of the porch or entrance to King Solomon’s temple, so named after the great-grandfather of David; a prince and ruler in Israel. The import of the word is strength . * This is also a penal sign with masons. It refers to a supposed custom among the inhabitants of Tyre of losing a finger at that joint for a crime."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 11 W. M. Brother Junior Deacon, pass the candidate to the Junior Warden. J. D. Brother Junior Warden , I present to you Brother N——, on his initiation. J. W. I will thank Brother N——, to advance towards me as a mason. He advances with the step and sign. J. W. Have you anything else to communicate ? Brother N. gives the grip. J. W. What is this ? B. N. The grip or token of an Entered Apprentice Free- mason. J. W. What does it demand ? B. N. A word. J. W. Will you give me that word ? B. N. At my initiation I was taught to be cautious.

( The word is then given as before with, the Junior Warden, and the Junior Deacon passes the brother to the Senior Warden, where the same ceremony is repe ated ; after which he is pre- sented to the Master .) S. W. Worshipful Master, I present to you Brother N——, on his initiation, for some further mark of your favour. W. M. Brother Senior Warden, I delegate to you the au- thority to invest him with the distinguishing badge of a mason. S. W. Brother N——, by the worshipful Master’s com- mand, I invest you with the distinguishing badge of a mason, which is more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle ; more honourable than the Star and Garter ; or any other order in existence ; being the badge of innocence and the bond of friendship. I strongly exhort you ever to wear and to consider it as su ch. And I further inform you, that, if you never disgrace that badge, it will never dis- grace you. W. M. Let me add to the ob servations of the Senior War- den, that you are never to put on that badge, should there be any brother in the lodge which you are about to visit with whom you are at variance, or against whom you entertain animosity. In such case, it is expected that you will invite "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 12 him to withdraw, in order to settle your differences amicably, which, if happily effected, you may then clothe yourselves, enter the lodge, and work with that love and harmony, which ought always to characterize Freemasons. But if, unfortu- nately, your differences be of su ch a nature as not to be easily adjusted, it were better th at one or both of you should retire, than that the harmony of the Lodge be disturbed by your presence. W. M. Brother Junior Deacon, you will place our Brother N—— at the north-east part of the Lodge. W. M. Brother N——, it is customary at the erection of all stately and superb edifices, to lay the first foundation stone at the north-east corner of the building. You, being newly admitted into Masonry, are placed at the north-east part of the Lodge, to represent figuratively that stone ; and from the foundation laid this evening, may you raise a superstructure perfect in its parts and honour able to its builder. You now stand, to all external appearance , a just and upright mason. I give it you in strong terms of recommendation ever to continue and act as such. Indeed I sh all immediately put your prin- ciples in some measure, to the test, by calling upon you to ex- ercise that virtue which may ju stly be denominated the dis- tinguishing characteristic of a Freemason’s heart,—I mean Charity . I need not here dilate upon its excellencies ; doubt- less, it has often been felt and practised by you : suffice it to say, that it has the approbation of heaven and of earth, and, like its sister Mercy , blesses him that gives as well as him that receives. In a society so widely extended as that of the Free- masons, whose branches are sprea d over the four divisions of the globe, it cannot be denied that we have many members of rank and affluence ; neither can it be concealed, that, among the thousands who range und er its banners, there are some, who, perhaps, from circumstance s of unavoidable calamity and misfortune, are reduced to the lowest ebb of poverty and dis- tress : on their behalf, it is our usual custom to awaken the feelings of every newly-made br other, by such a claim on his charity, as his circumstances in life may fairly warrant. What- ever you feel disposed to give, deposit with the Junior Deacon, and it will be thankfully received, and faithfully applied. B. N. I have been deprived of every thing valuable, or I would give freely. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 13 W.M. I congratulate you on the honourable sentiments by which you are actuated, and likewi se on the inability which in the present instance precludes you from gratifying them. Be- lieve me, this trial was not made with a view of sporting with your feelings : far from us be any such intention ; but it was done for three especial reasons ; first, as I have already pro- mised, to put your principles to the test ; second to evince to the brethren, that you had ne ither money nor other metallic substance about you ; for, if yo u had, the ceremony of your initiation thus far must have been repeated, which would have brought a blush on the face of your guide for having so im- properly omitted that part of his duty : and thirdly, as a warn- ing to your own heart, that sh ould you, at any future period, meet a brother in distressed circumstances, who solicits your assistance, you may recollect the peculiar moment in which you were received into Masonry, poor and penniless, and you will then cheerfully embrace the opportunity of practising that virtue which you have professed to admire. You may now retire, for the purpose of being restored to your necessary comforts, then ret urn into the lodge and return thanks, after which I shall give you further instructions, and deliver a charge upon the excellency of our order and the qualifications of its members. Brother N—— then retires to re store his dress, and, on his return, is placed in the west, or opposite to the Master, where. after making the penal sign of an entered apprentice, he re- turns thanks in the following words : Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens, Senior and Junior Deacons, and Brethren of this Lodge, I return you my most hearty and sincere thanks for the honour you have done me, by making me a Mason, and by admitting me a member of this ancient and honourable Society. W. M. Brother N——, as, in th e course of the evening you will be called upon for certain fees for your initiation, it is but proper that you should know by what authority we act. These, therefore, are our warrant from the Grand Lodge of England, the book of constitutions and the bye-laws of the Lodge ; both of which I recommend to your most serious con- templation, as by one you will be instructed in the duties you owe to the craft in general, and by the other in those you owe to this lodge in particular. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 14 I now present to you the working tools of an Entered Ap- prentice Freemason, which are the twenty-four inch gauge, the common gavel, and the chisel. The twenty-four inch gauge is the first instrument put into the hand of the workman, to en able him to measure and ascer- tain the size and extent of the work he is about to engage in, thus to compute the time and labour it may cost. The common gavel is an importa nt instrument of labour, and highly esteemed as an implement of art ; though recognised by various artists under different appelations, it is yet admitted by them all, that no work of manual skill can be completed without it. The chisel is a small instrume nt, though solid in its form, and of such exquisite sharpness as fully to compensate for the diminutiveness of its size. It is calculated to make impression on the hardest substance, and the mightiest structures have been indebted to its aid. But, as we have met, on the p resent occasion, as speculative, rather than as operative Masons, it is the moral conveyed in those emblems that we are calle d upon more particularly to regard. From the twenty-four inch gauge, we derive a lesson of daily admonition and instruction ; for, as it is divided into twenty-four parts, it recalls to our mind the division of the natural day into twenty-four ho urs, and directs us to appor- tionate them to their proper objects ; namely prayer , labour , refreshment , and sleep . To a Mason, however, it may be further considered as the scale which comprehends the numerical apportionment of the different degrees, according to the several lodges, of which I am permitted to say, the firs t seven are appropriated to the Entered Apprentice. From the common gavel, we learn that skill without exertion is of little avail—that labour is the lot of man ; for the heart may conceive and the head devise in vain, if the hand be not prompt to execute the design. From the chisel, we learn that perseverance is necessary to establish perfection, that the rude material can receive its fine polish but from repeated efforts alone, that nothing short of indefatigable exertion can induce the habit of virtue, enlighten the mind and render the soul pure. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 15 From the whole we deduce this moral, that knowledge grounded on accuracy, aided by labour, prompted by perse- verance, will finally overcome all difficulties, raise igno- rance from despair, and esta blish happiness in paths of science. THE CHARGE . As you have now passed through the ceremonies of your initiation, allow me to congra tulate you on being admitted a member of our ancient and honourable society. Ancient, no doubt, it is, as having subsis ted from time immemorial ; and honourable it must be acknowled ged to be, because, by a natu- ral tendency, it conduces to make all those honourable who are strictly obedient to its precepts. Indeed, no institution can boast a more solid foundation than that on which Freemasonry rests—the practice of social and moral virtue. To so high an eminence has its credit been advanced, that, in every age, monarchs themselves have been the promoters of the art : have not thought it derogatory from their dignity, to exchange the sceptre for the trowel ; have patronized our mysteries, and have even joined our assemblies. As a Mason, I would first recommend to your most serious contemplation the volume of the sacred law, charging you to consider it as the unerring standard of truth and justice, and to regulate your actions by the divine precepts which it contains. Therein you will be taught the im portant duty you owe to God, to your neighbour, and to yourself. To God, by never men- tioning his name but with that awe and reverence which are due from the creature to his Creator, and by imploring his aid on all your lawful undertakings, and by looking up to him in every emergency for comfort and support ; to your neighbour, by act- ing with him upon the square, by rendering him every kind office which justice or mercy may require, by relieving his dis- tresses, by soothing his afflicti ons, and by doing to him as, in similar cases, you would wish him to do to you ; and to your self, by such a prudent and well-regulated course of discipline as may best conduce to the preservation of your corporeal and mental faculties in their fullest energy ; thereby enabling you to exert the talents wherewith Go d has blest you, as well to his glory as to the welfare of your fellow-creatures. As a citizen of the world, I am next to enjoin you to be "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 16 exemplary in the discharge of your civil duties, by never proposing, or at all countenanc ing, any act that may have a tendency to subvert the peace and good order of society ; by paying due obedience to the laws of any state which may for a time become the place of your residence, or afford you its protection ; and, above all, neve r losing sight of the allegiance due to the sovereign of your native land ; ever remembering that nature has implanted in your breast a sacred and indisso- luble attachment to that country from which you derived your birth and infant nurture. As an individual, I am further to recommend the practice of every domestic as well as public virtue. Let prudence direct you ; temperance chasten you ; fortitude support you ; and justice be the guide of all your actions. Be especially careful to maintain, in the fullest sple ndour, those truly masonic orna- ments which have already been amply illustrated— benevolence and charity . Still, however, as a Mason, there are other excellencies of character to which your attent ion may be peculiarly and for- cibly directed. Among the foremost of these are secrecy , fidelity , and obedience . Secrecy may be said to consist of an inviolable adherance to the obligation you have entered into, never improperly to re- veal any of those masonic secret s which have now been, or may at any future time be, intrusted to your keeping ; and cau- tiously to shun all occasions which might inadvertently lead you to do so. Your fidelity must be exemplified by a strict observance of the constitutions of the fraternity, by adhering to the an- cient landmarks of the order ; by never attempting to extort or otherwise unduly obtain, the secrets of a superior degree, and by refraining to recommend anyone to a participation of our secrets, unless you have strong grounds to believe that, by similar fidelity, he will ultimately reflect honour on our choice. So must your obedience he proved by a close conformity to our laws and regulations ; by prom pt attention to all signs and summonses : by modest and correct demeanour whilst in the Lodge ; by abstaining from every topic of religious or political discussion ; by ready acquiescence in all votes and resolutions duly passed by the brethren ; and by perfect submission "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 17 to the master and his wardens, whilst acting in the dis- charge of their respective offices. And, as a last general recommendation, let me exhort you to dedicate yourself to such pursuits as may enable you to become at once respectable in your rank of life, useful to mankind, and an ornament to the society of which you have this day been admitted a member : that you will more especially devote a part of your leisure hours to the study of such of the liberal arts and sciences as may lie within the compass of your attainment , and that without neglecting the ordinary duties of your station, you will consider your- self called upon to make a daily advancement in masonic knowledge. From the very commendable attention which you appear to have given to this charge, I am led to hope that you will duly appreciate the excellency of Freemasonry, and im- print indelibly on your mind the sacred dictates of truth, honour, and virtue. LECTURE ON THE TRACING BOARD . The usages and customs of masons have ever corres- ponded with those of the ancien t Egyptians, to which they bear a near affinity. Their philosophers, unwilling to ex- pose their mysteries to vulgar eyes, concealed their partic- ular tenets and principles of polity and philosophy under hieroglyphical figures, and expressed their notions of government by signs and symbols, which they communi- cated to their Priests or Magi alone, who were bound by oath not to reveal them. Pythag oras seems to have estab- lished his system on a similar plan, and many orders of a more recent date have copied their example. But ma- sonry, however, is not only th e most ancient, but the most moral institution that has ever existed, as every character, figure, and emblem depicted in the lodge has a moral ten- dency, and tends to inculcate the practice of virtue. Let me first call your attention to the form of the Lodge, which is of an oblong square: in the length from east to west, in breadth between north and south, in depth from the surface of the earth to the centre, and even as high as the heavens. The reason that a Freemason’s Lodge is "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 18 represented of this vast extent is to show the universality of the science, and that a Ma son’s charity should know no bounds save those of prudence. Our Lodge stands on holy ground ; because the first Lodge was consecrated on account of three grand offering s thereon made, which met with divine approbation : first, the ready compliance of Abraham to the will of God, in not refusing to offer up his son Isaac as a burnt offering, when it pleased the Almighty to substitute a more agreeable victim in his stead ; second, the many pious prayers and ejaculations of King David, which actually appeased the wrath of God, and stayed a pestilence which then raged among his people, owing to his inadvertently having had them numbered : and thirdly, the many thanksgivings, oblations, burnt sacrifices, and costly offerings, which Solomon King of Israel made at the completion, dedication, and consecration of the Temple of Jerusalem to God’s service. Those three did then, have since, and I trust, ever will, render the groundwork of Ma- sonry holy. Our Lodge is situ ated due east and west; be- cause all places of divine worship, as well as Masons’ regu- lar, well-formed, and constituted Lodges are, or ought to be, so situated : for which we assign three Masonic rea- sons : first, the sun, the glory of the Lord, rises in the east and sets in the west ; second, learning originated in the east, and from thence spread its benign influence to the west ; a third, last, and grand reason, which is too long to be entered upon now, is explained in the course of our lec- tures, which you will have many opportunities of hearing. Our Lodge is supported by three grand pillars. They are called wisdom , strength , and beauty . Wisdom to con- trive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn. Wisdom to conduct us in all our undertakings ; strength to support us under all our difficulties, and beauty to adorn the in- ward man. The universe is th e temple of the Deity whom we serve—wisdom, strength, and beauty, are both his throne and pillars of his works ; for his wisdom is infinite his strength is omnipotent, and beauty shines through the whole of the creation. In symmetry and order the heav- ens he has stretched forth as a canopy; the earth he has planted as his footstool; he crowds his temple with stars, as "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 19 with a diadem ; and his hands extend their power and glory. The sun and the moon are messengers of his will, and all his law is concord. The three great pillars sup- porting a Mason’s Lodge are emblematical of those divine attributes, and further represent, Solomon King of Israel, Hiram King of Tyre and Hiram Abiff—Solomon King of Israel for his wisdom in buil ding, completing, and dedica- ting the temple at Jerusalem to God’s service ; Hiram King of Tyre for his strength in supporting him with men and materials ; and Hiram Abiff for his curious and masterly workmanship in beautifying and adorning the same. As there are no noble orders in architecture known by the name of wisdom, strength, and beauty, we refer them to the three most celebrated—the Doric, Ionic, and the Corin- thian. The covering of a Freemason’s Lodge is a celestial can- opy of divers colours, even as the heavens. The way by which we, as masons, hope to a rrive at it is by the assist- ance of a ladder, in Scripture called Jacob’s ladder. It is composed, of many staves, or rounds, which point out as many moral virtues. Th ree are principal ones— Faith , Hope , and Charity . Faith in the great Architect of the universe ; hope in salvation; an d to be in charity with all men. It reaches to the heave ns, and rests on the volume of the sacred law ; because, by the doctrines contained in that holy book, we are taught to believe in the wise dis- pensations of Divine Providence, which belief strengthens our faith and enables us to as cend the first step. This faith naturally creates in us a hope of becoming partakers of the blessed promises therein recorded, which hope en- ables us to ascend the second step. But the third and last being charity, comprehends the whole ; and the Mason who is possessed of that virtue in its most ample sense, may justly be deemed to have attained the summit of his pro- fession, figuratively speaking, an ethereal mansion veiled from mortal eye by the starry firmament; emblematically depicted here by seven stars, which have an allusion to as many regularly made Masons, without which number no Lodge is perfect, nor can any ca ndidate be legally initiated into the order. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 20 The interior of a Freemason’s Lodge is composed of orna- ments, furniture and jewels. The ornaments of the Lodge are the Mosaic pavement, the blazing star, and the in- dented or tesselated border. The mosaic pavement is the beautiful flooring of a Freemason’s Lodge ; the blazing star, the glory in the centre ; and the indented or tesselated border, the skirtwork round th e same. The mosaic pave- ment may justly be deemed the beautiful flooring of the Lodge, by reason of its being variegated and chequered. This points out the diversity of objects which decorate and adorn the creation, the animate as well as the inanimate parts thereof. The blazing star or glory in the centre re- fers us to that grand luminary the sun, which enlightens the earth, and, by its benign influence, dispenses its bless- ings to mankind in general. The indented or tesselated border refers us to the planets, which, in their various revolutions, form a beautiful border of skirt work round that grand luminary the sun, as the other does round that of a Freemason’s Lodge. The furniture of the Lodge is the volume of the sacred law, the compasses and the square. The sacred writings ar e to govern our faith. On them we obligate our candidat es for Masonry. So are the compass and square when united to regulate our lives and actions. The sacred volume is derived from God to man in general. The compasses belo ng to the Grand Master in particular, and the square to the whole craft. The Jewels of the Lodge are three moveable and three immoveable. The moveable jewels are the square, level, and plumb-rule. Among operative Masons, the square is to try and adjust all irregular corners of buildings, and to assist in bringing rude matter into due form ; the level , to lay levels and prove horizontals ; and the plumb-rule to try and adjust all uprights while fixed on their proper basis. Among free and accepted Maso ns, the square teaches mor- ality, the level equality, and the plumb-rule justness and uprightness of life and actio ns. They are called moveable jewels because they are worn by the Master and his War- dens, and are transferable from them to their successors on nights of installation. The Ma ster is distinguished by the square; the Senior Warden by the level; and the Junior "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 21 Warden by the plumb-rule. The immoveable jewels are the tracing board and the rough and perfect ashlers . The tracing board is for the Master to lay lines and to draw de- signs on. The rough ashler for the entered apprentice to work, mark, and indent on ; and the perfect ashler for the experienced craftsman to try and adjust his jewels on. They are called immoveable, be cause they lie open for the brethren to moralise upon. As the tracing board is for the Master to lay lines and draw designs on, the better to en- able the brethren to carry on the intended structure with regularity and propriety, so the volume of the sacred law may justly be deemed the spir itual tracing board of the great Architect of the universe, in which are laid down such divine laws and moral plans, that were we conversant therein and adherent thereto, they would bring us to an ethereal mansion not built by hands, but eternally in the heavens. The rough ashler is a stone, rough and unhewn, as taken from the quarry, till by the industry and ingenu- ity of the workman it is mode lled, wrought into due form, and rendered fit for the intended building. This repre- sents the mind of man in its infant or primitive state, rough and unpolished as that st one, till by the kind care and attention of his parents or guardians in giving him a liberal and virtuous education, his mind becomes culti- vated, and he is thereby rendered a fit member of civilised society. The perfect ashler is a stone of a true die, square, and fit only to be tried by th e square and compasses. This represents the mind of man in a decline of years, after a regular and well-spent life in acts of piety and virtue, which can no otherwise be tried and approved than by the square of God’s word, and the compasses of his own self- convincing conscience. In all regular, well-formed, constituted Lodges, there is a point within a circle round which a Mason cannot err. This circle is bounded between north and south by two grand parallel lines, and one represents Moses, the other King Solomon. On the upper part of this circle rests the volume of the sacred law, wh ich supports Jacob’s Ladder, the top of which reaches to the heavens; and were we as adherent to the doctrines therein contained as both those "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 22 parallels were, it would not deceive us, nor should we suffer deception. In going round this circle, we must necessarily touch on both thos e parallel lines and on the sacred volume, and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed he cannot err. The word Lewis denotes strength and is here depicted by certain pieces of metal, wh ich, when dovetailed in a stone, form a cramp, and enables the operative Mason to raise great weights to certain heights with little encum- brance, and to fix them on their proper bases. Lewis likewise denotes the son of a Mason. His duty is to bear the burden and heat of the da y, from which his parents, by reason of their age, ought to be exempt; to help them in time of need, and thereby render the close of their days happy and comfortable. His privilege for so doing is to be made a Mason before any other person, however dignified. Pendant to the corners of the Lodge are four tassels, meant to remind us of the four cardinal virtues, namely, Temperance , Fortitude , Prudence , and Justice , the whole of which tradition informs us were constantly practised by a great majority of our ancient brethren. The distinguishing characters of a good Freemason are virtue, honour and mercy ; and should those be banished from all other societies, may they ever be found in a Mason’s breast. LECTURE IN THE FIRST DEGREE . Introduction. Masonry, according to the ge neral acceptation of the term, is an art founded on th e principles of Geometry, and directed to the service and convenience of mankind ; but Freemasonry, embracing a wider range, and having a nobler object in view, namely, the cultivation and im- provement of the human mind, may, with more propri- ety, be called a science ; inasmu ch as, availing itself of the terms of the former, it inculcates the principles of the purest morality, though it s lessons are for the most part veiled in allegory and i llustrated by symbols. To draw aside this veil, therefore, or more properly speak- ing, to penetrate throughout it, is the object of directions in Freemasonry, and by a careful and appropriate atten- tion to them we may hope, ultimately, to become ac- quainted with all its mysteries. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 23 The Lecture of the First Degree is divided into seven sections, and each section is subdivided into three clauses. Throughout the whole virtue is painted in the most beautiful colours, and the duties of morality are everywhere strictly enforced. The principles of know- ledge are imprinted on the memory by lively and sensible images, well calculated to influence our conduct in the proper discharge of the duties of social life. The mode of Masonic instruction is. catechetical ; I shall, therefore, Brethren, without further comment, challenge you by the usual questions, and I have no doubt but you will reply to them in a becoming manner. Assured, then, Brother Senior Warden, by a previous conviction, that you are a Freemason, let me ask you, in that character, from whence came you? FIRST SECTION .— First Clause . Q. Brother Senior Warden, from whence came you ? A. From the West. Q. Whither are you directing your course? A. To the East. Q. What is your object ? A. To seek a Master, and from him to gain instruction. Q. Who are you that want instruction ? A. A free and Accepted Mason. Q. What mode of introduction have you to recommend yourself to notice as a Mason ? A. ( Gives the E. A. sign .) A salute of respect to the Master in the chair. Q. Any other recommendation ? A. ( Gives the sign .) A hearty salute to all under his direction. Q. For what purpose came you hither? A. To regulate my conduct, correct my passions, and make a progress in Masonry. Q. How do you know yourself to be a Mason ? A. By the regularity of my initiation, repeated trials and approbations, and a readine ss at all times to under- go an examination, when properly called on. Q. How shall I know you to be a mason ? A. By signs , tokens , and perfect points of my entrance . Q. What are signs . A. All squares, levels, and perpendiculars; and those when duly given a Mason will hail and obey. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 24 Q. To what do they serve ? A. To distinguish a Mason by day. Q. What are tokens ? A. Certain peculiar and friendly grips, which, when reciprocally given, will distinguish a Mason by night as well as by day. Q. What are the perfect points of entrance ? A. Points which I am bound most carefully to conceal. Q. Give me the number? A. Three are known to me. Q. I also acknowledge three,—will you name them ? A. Reciprocally with you, I will. Q. Begin then: A. Of. Q. At. A. On. Q. Explain them. A. Of , with respect to apparel. At , the door of the Lodge. On , my left knee bare and bended. Q. Why are they called perfect points of entrance ? A. Because they include the whole ceremony of initia- tion. Q. How so ? A. Of , includes the whole ceremony of preparation; At , that of due submission; and On , that of a solemn obliga- tion. Second Clause . Q. Where were you made a Mason ? A. In a Lodge, just, perfect, and regular. Q. What do you mean by a Lodge ? A. An assembly of Masons met to expatiate on the mysteries of Freemasonry. Q. What makes it just ? A. The volume of the sacred law unfolded. Q. What makes it perfect ? A. The number seven. Q. Of whom is the number composed ? A. Three Masters, two Fellow-Crafts, and two Entered Apprentices. Q. Why so? A. That every order of Masonry may be virtual1y pre- sent by their representatives, to ratify and confirm the proceedings of the whole. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 25 Q. What makes it regular ? A. The warrant of constitution. Q. What is the warrant of constitution ? A. The sanction of the Grand Master presiding over Masons for the country in which the Lodge is held. Q. When were you made a Mason ? A. When the sun was at its meridian. Q. In this country, Masons' Lodges are generally held in the evening : How do you account for this, which at first appears a paradox ? A. The sun being a fixed body, the earth constantly re- volving round on its own axis, it necessarily follows that the sun is always at its meridian, and Freemasonry being universally spread over its surfac e, it follows as a second consequence, that the sun is always at its meridian with respect to Freemasonry. Q. By whom were you made a Mason ? A. By the Worshipful Master, assisted by the Wardens, and in the presence of the Brethren assembled. Q. Where was the Master placed ? A. In the East. Q. Why so ? A. As the sun rises in the East, to open and enliven the day, so is the Worshipful Ma ster placed in the East to open the Lodge, and employ and instruct the Brethren in Masonry. Q. Where was the Junior Warden placed ? A. In the South. Q. Why so ? A. To mark the sun at its meridian, to call the Brethren from labour to refreshment, and from refreshment to labour, that profit and pleasure may be the result. Q. Where is the Senior Warden placed ? A. In the West. Q. Why so? A. To mark the setting sun, to close the Lodge by the command of the Worshipful Master, after seeing that everyone has his just due. Q. What do they conjointly represent ? A. The sun in the three stages of its diurnal progress. Q. Illustrate this farther. A. As the sun rises in th e East to open the day, and dispenses light, life, arid no urishment to the whole crea- tion, it is well represented by the Worshipful Master, who "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 26 is placed in the east to open the Lodge. and who imparts light, knowledge, and instru ction to all under his direc- tion. When it arrives at its greatest altitude in the south, where its beams are most piercing and the cool shade most refreshing, it is then also well represented by the Junior Warden, who is placed in the south to observe its approach to the meridian, and at the hour of noon to call the Brethren from labour to refreshment. Still pur- suing its course to the west, the sun at length closes the day, and lulls all nature to re pose; it is then fitly repre- sented by the Senior Warden, who is placed in the west to close the Lodge by command of the Worshipful Master, after having rendered to every one the just reward of his labour, and after enabling them to enjoy that repose which is the genuine fruit of honest industry. Third Clause . Q. Why were you made a Mason ? A. For the sake of obtain ing the knowledge and secrets preserved among Freemasons. Q. Where are those secrets kept ? A. In their hearts. Q. To whom are they revealed? A. To Masons, and to Masons alone. Q. How are they revealed? A. By signs, tokens, and particular words . Q. By what means is any further conversation held ? A. By means of a key equally singular in its construc- tion and in its operation. Q. Where is this key found ? A. Within an arch of bone. Q. Where does it lie ? A. It does not lie, it is suspended. Q. Why so? A. That it might be always ready to perform its office, and never betray its trust through negligence. Q. What is it suspended by ? A. The thread of life. Q. Why so nearly connected with the heart ? A. To lock its secrets from the unworthy, and to open its treasures to the deserving. Q. Of what is this key composed ? A. It is not composed of metal, nor formed by any mortal art. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 27 Q. Explain this mystery. A. It is the tongue of good report, ever ready to pro- tect, never to betray. Q. What are its distinguishing characteristics ? A. To defend the interests of a Brother in his absence, to speak favourably of him, if truth will permit ; and when that cannot be done with propriety, to adopt a Mason’s peculiar virtue, silence. MORAL . We have now, Brethren, closed the first section of our lecture ; which, though it professes to embrace little more than preliminaries, will serve to teach us that the zeal of Masons in the acquisition of knowledge is bounded by no space, since they travel from Ea st to West in its pursuit, and the principles which actuate the pursuit are highly conducive to morality,—namely, the attempt to rule and subdue the passions ; and lastly, where candour cannot commend, their silence will at least avoid reproach. SECOND SECTION .— First Clause . Q. What preparation is necessary to be made a Mason ? A. A preparation of a twofold nature, internal and ex- ternal . Q. Where does the first take place ? A. In the heart. Q. That being internal, how is it to be exemplified ? A. By the declaration I was called on to make with re- spect to the motives which indu ced me to seek the privi- leges of Freemasonry. Q. Of how many parts is that declaration composed? A. Three. Q. Repeat them. A. First, that I was free by birth, and of the full age of twenty-one years. Second , that unbiassed by the im- proper solicitation of friends, and uninfluenced by mer- cenary or other unworthy motive, I freely and voluntarily offered myself a candidate for the mysteries of Free- masonry. Thirdly, that I wa s prompted solely by a fav- ourable opinion preconceived of the institution, and a de- sire of knowledge ; and that I would cheerfully conform to all the ancient usages and established customs of the order. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 28 Q. What further testimony were you required to give as proof of the sincerity of your intentions ? A. I was required to sign my name to the substance of the foregoing declaration. Q. Where did the next or external preparation take place ? A. In a convenient room adjoining the Lodge. Q. How were you prepared ? A. I was deprived of all metal, and hoodwinked,—my right arm, left breast, and left knee made bare,—my right heel slipshod,—and a cable-tow put round my neck. Q. Why deprived of metal ? A. That I might bring nothing offensive or defensive into the Lodge, as the principles of Masonry forbidding the one, render the other unnecessary. Q. The second reason ? A. To prove to me that wealth and distinction, however valued in the world, could have no influence in procuring my admission or advancement among Masons. Q. The third reason? A. To imprint on my memory the peculiarity of a cir- cumstance which occurred at the building of the Temple of Jerusalem, under the auspices of King Solomon, inas- much as, during the whole time, there was not the sound of axe, hammer, or any other t ool of brass or iron heard within the precinct of Mount Sion, to disturb the peace- ful sanctity of that holy place. Q. How was this structure completed without the aid of those implements P A. The stones were hewn in the quarry, there carved, marked, and numbered. The timber was felled and pre- pared in the forest of Lebanon, and conveyed by floats from Tyre to Joppa. The metals were fused and cast on the plains of Zeredathah. Af ter which, the whole was conveyed to Jerusalem, and there set up by means of mauls and other implements, prepared for that purpose. Q. Why were the materials prepared so far off ? A. The better to distinguish the excellence of the Craft ; for, although the materials were prepared at so great a distance, when they came to be set up at Jerusa- lem, the whole appeared more like the work of the Great Architect of the Universe than of mortal hands. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 29 Q. Why were metallic tools prohibited ? A. That the Temple of God might not be polluted. Q. What is the moral inference which we derive from their prohibition ? A. That our ancient and venerable institution depends not for its support and permanency on any principle of a compulsive or coercive nature, but is best cemented by the perfect union and harmony of its constituent parts. Second Clause. Q. Why were you hoodwinked? A. In case of refusal to undergo the accustomed cere- monies in making a Mason, I might be led out of the Lodge without discovering its form. Q. The second reason ? A. That, as I was received in to Masonry in a state of utter darkness, until duly brough t to light, so it was con- sidered that I should keep a ll the world in ignorance of our institutions until they were lawfully gained. Q. The third reason? A. That my heart might be taught to conceive before my eyes were permitted to discover. Q. Why was your right arm made bare ? A. As a token of confiden ce, and to show that I was unarmed and unguarded. Q. Why was your left breast made bare ? A. As a token of sincerity, and to show that I was no impostor. Q. Why was your left knee made bare ? A. As a token of humility. Q. Why were you slipshod ? A. It alludes to a very anci ent custom of slipping the shoe from off the foot, as a p ledge of fidelity to the arti- cles of any solemn compact. Q. Why was a cable-tow placed round your neck ? A. That if, influenced by fear, I should attempt to fall back, all hopes of retreat might be cut off. Q. Being thus properly prepared, where were you con- ducted, and by whom ? A. To the door of the Lodg e by a friend, whom I after- wards found to be a Brother. Q. Why in that condition ? A. That I might thence learn as a Mason to practise "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 30 universal beneficence, to be as eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame : that, whenever in my progress through life, I should meet with a worthy ma n, particularly a Mason, in that state of distress, th e appearance of which I then voluntarily assumed, I should stretch forth my right hand of Fellowship to comfort and protect him. Third Clause. Q. Being in a state of darkne ss, how did you know it to be a door? A. By meeting with opposition, and afterwards gain- ing admission. Q. Whom did you meet to oppose your entrance? A. One whom I afterwards found to be the Tiler. Q. What is his peculiar duty? . A. To be armed with a drawn sword, to keep away all cowans and listeners from Maso nry, and to see the candi- date come properly prepared. Q. How did you gain admission ? A. By three knocks on the door. Q. To what do they allude ? A. To a venerable exhortatio n, seek and ye shall find, ask and ye shall have, knock an d it shall be opened unto you. Q. How do you apply that exhortation to your then situation ? A. I sought in my mind, asked of my friend, he knocked, and the door of Masonry became opened unto me. Q. Who then came to your assistance ? A. One whom I afterwards found to be the Inner Guard ? Q. What is his peculiar duty ? A. To admit Masons upon proof, to receive the candi- date in due form, and to obey the commands of the Junior Warden. Q. What did he demand of the Tiler ? A. Who he had got there. Q. The Tiler’s answer ? A. Mr. N——, a poor candidate, in a state of darkness, who has been well and worthily recommended, regularly proposed, and approved in open Lodge. who now comes "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 31 of his own free will, properly prepared, humbly soliciting to be admitted to the mysteries and privileges of Free- masonry. Q. What said the Inner Guard ? A. How does he hope to attain those privileges ? Q. The Tiler's answer ? A. By the help of God, being free-born, and of good report. Q. Were you admitted on this ? A. No. I was desired to ha lt till duly reported to the Worshipful Master, who, after having observed that the tongue of good report had already been heard in my fav- our, was pleased to order my admission. Q. On what were you admitted ? A. On the point of a sharp instrument presented to my naked left breast. Q. For what purpose ? A. To distinguish my sex, and to show that I was no impostor. Q. After gaining your admission, how were you dis- posed of ? A. I was conducted by the Junior Deacon through the exterior avenues, till I arrive d at the portal of the Lodge itself, the Inner Guard all th e while holding a sword to my naked left breast, and the Junior Deacon a cable-tow round my neck. On halting there, the Worshipful Master was pleased to observe, that as no person could be made a Mason unless he was free-born and of mature age, he demanded of me whether I was fr ee by birth, and of the full age of twenty-one. To which I agreed that I was. Q. What was then required of you? A. To kneel while the blessing of Heaven was invoked on our proceedings.. MORAL The moral of the second sect ion of our lecture is the in- struction that we should be, firstly, qualified by birth and age, to go in pursuit of knowledge in important secrets ; secondly, that we should be as humble in mind, as, at our initiation, we are presented in bodily posture and ap- parel : thirdly, the hoodwinkin g represents the dark state of our minds at that period ; fourthly, being bereft of "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 32 money, the circumstances, that the humility of poverty is more favourable to the pursuit of useful knowledge, than the possession of riches that may inflate our natural pride ; and fifthly, that the steady pursuit of knowledge is more peculiarly the province of the male sex. THIRD SECTION . Q. What is Freemasonry ? A. A peculiar system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. Q. What are the three great principles on which Free- masonry is founded? A. Brotherly love , relief , and truth . Q. I will thank you to illustrate Brotherly love . A. Brotherly love is the sacred principle which com- bines and cements our fraternity in the practice of moral virtue and the pursuit of scie ntific attainment. By this generous sentiment, we are taught to divest ourselves of each selfish consideration an d narrow prejudice, reflect- ing that we are united by a strict and endearing relation, as creatures of the same God, children of the same first parents, and Brethren of the same solid tie. Q. I will thank you to illustrate relief . A. Relief is a duty which every man owes to his fellow man in consideration of the common infirmities of human nature : but stronger is the clai m of those to whom we are voluntarily and reciprocally pledged in the bond of brotherly love and affection, and therefore unquestion- ably it is the right of Masons to rely upon each other for succour in the hour of need, by pecuniary aid, or by pro- curing assistance, advice, and protection, according to their relative circumstances and conditions in life. Q. I will thank you to illustrate truth ? A. Truth is a principle of inimitable and eternal nature, derived from the grea t Father of Light, conform- able with his holy will, and in terwoven with the laws of his creation. It is the duty of every true Mason who seeks to walk according to the light, to make that sacred principle the guide of his words and actions, ever remem- bering that truth and wisdom are the same ; and to him who makes truth the object of his search, that truth will assuredly prove the reward of his perseverance. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 33 Q. How many principal points are there in Masonry ? A. Four. Q. To what do they refer ? A. To the ceremony of initiation, are denominated from so many parts of the human body, and are called Guttural , Pec- toral , Mental , and Pedal . Q. To what do they further allude ? A. To the four cardinal virtues— Temperance , Fortitude , Prudence , and Justice . Q. To which of those virtues does the Guttural allude ? A. Temperance , which demands such a cautious habit of restraint as may be necessary to preserve us from the risk of violating our obligation and incurring its penalty. Q. To which the Pectoral ? A. The Pectoral more particularly refers to the virtue of fortitude, which is equally ne cessary to defend our hearts against the powerful influence of allurements to terrors, that might prevail over our weakness, and, by extorting from us the secrets of Masonry, would pl ant an eternal torment in our conscience. Q. To which the Mental ? A. The Mental reminds us of that deliberate and steady prudence which ought to guide our actions, forbidding us to seal with the sacred pledge of our right hand what the heart has not sanctioned with its approbation. Q. To which the Pedal ? A. The Pedal is the point on which we receive the first great recommendation of the Master, ever to continue, as we then appeared, upright men and Masons. It therefore denotes the duty of universal justice, wh ich consists in doing to others as we would they should do un to us. Q. I will thank you to illustrate Temperance . A. Temperance is more peculiarly the virtue of prosperity, as it guards the soul against. those insidious allurements by which its nobler feelings are too often corrupted. But her in- fluence is not confined to the hour of prosperity alone : she forms the mind to a general ha bit of restraint over its appe- tites, its passions, and even its virtues ; any of which, if al- lowed to acquire exclusive influence over the soul, would concentrate the faculties in a si ngle point, absorb its feelings, and confine its energies, insensibly producing intolerance of "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 34 sentiment, and degenerating into an excess scarcely less perni- cious than vice itself. Tempera nce may, therefore, be styled the crown of all the virtues. H er influence, like the masters of the ancient lyre, can modulate the varied chords of lively sympathy, or generous feelings, till each acquires its due tone and vibration, and the whole become blended in one sweet ac- cordant harmony. Q. I will thank you to illustrate Fortitude . A. Fortitude is that virtue which arms the soul against the storms of adversity, enables it to rise superior to distress and danger, and gives its strength to res3ist the temptations and allurements of vice. But this virtue is equally distant from impetuous rashness on the one hand, and from dishon- est cowardice on the other. The truly brave neither shrink from the evils which they are constrained to encounter, nor rush on danger without feeling and estimating its full extent. Fortitude, therefore, differs from constitutional hardiness, as real benevolence is distinguished from weakness, being actuated not by a principle of blind instin ctive daring, but by the nobler motives of virtuous energy. He who with steady aim pursues the course which wisdom recommends, and justice consecrates, can cheerfully meet the hour of trial, smile at impending dan- ger, and contemn every sordid or unworthy motive which would deter or seduce him from the path of duty; whilst fearing God alone, he knows no other fear, and dares do all that does become a man—ever rem embering, that he who dares do more is none. Q. I will thank you to illustrate Prudence . A. Prudence may justly be defined the clear and distinct perception of the several relat ions between our actions and the purposes to which they are directed. In this view, it deserves to be considered as the first great principle of human wisdom ; and justly has the Roman mora list declared, that where pru- dence rules the mind, fortune ha s no influence. The prudent man, before be engages in any enterprise, maturely reflects on the consequences which may probably result from it, balancing with steady deliberations the several probabilities of good and evil, extending his views into futurity, and revolving in his mind every circumstance of doubtful event affecting the end which he has in view, or the means wh ich he purposes to use. He decides not hastily, and when he has decided, commits nothing "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 35 to chance ; but, comparing the th ree great periods of time with each other, from the reflection of the past regulates the present, and provides for the future ; by which means he neither wastes his energies improvidently, nor meets the occurrences in life incautiously. Q. I will thank you to illustrate Justice . A. As prudence directs us in the selection of the means most proper to attain our ends, so Justice teaches us to propose to ourselves such ends only as are consistent with our several relations to society, rendering to all, without distinction, those dues, which they are respectively entitled to claim from us ; bending with implicit obedience to the will of our Creator, and being scrupulously attentive to the sacred duties of life ; zea- lous in our attachment to our native country ; exemplary in our allegiance to the government under which we reside ; treat- ing our superiors with reverence, our equals with kindness, and to our inferiors, extending the benefit of admonition, instruc- tion, and protection. Q. Is there any symbolical reference to be derived from these points ? A. The speculative Mason beholds a symbolical allusion to the four great rivers which flowed out of the Garden of Eden. Q. I will thank you to illustrate them. A. In Pison our first parents revered the fountain of Pru- dence. In Gihon they beheld the sacred stream of Justice. The rapid and irresistible torrent of Heddekel denotes Forti- tude. And the Phrath , or Euphrates, the mild but steady current of Temperance. Happy was their state, while these sacred dictates were impressed upon their minds ; and happy may be our future lot, if we, through life, observe the lessons which they inculcate. Instructed by Prudence, guided by Justice, strengthened by Fort itude, and by Temperance re- strained. MORAL . Here, Brethren, we close the third section of our lecture. This section may, with strict propriety, be called didactical, or preceptive. This assertion is fully made out, that mo- rality is the great subject wi th which Freemasonry is conver "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 36 sant. Hence it follows, that the virtuous Mason, after he has enlightened his own mind with those sage and moral precepts, is the more ready to enlighten and enlarge the understanding of others. TO CLOSE THE LODGE IN THE FIRST OR ENTERED APPRENTICE ’ S DEGREE . ( The Master gives a knock, which is answered by a knock from each Warden as a call to order. ) W. M. Brethren, assist me to close the Lodge.—Brother Junior Warden, the constant care of every Mason ? J. W. To prove the Lodge close tiled. W. M. Direct that duty to be done. J. W. Brother Inner Guard, you will prove the Lodge close tiled. ( The I. G. gives three knocks on the inside of the door, which are answered by the Outer Guard, or Tiler, in the same way, which indicates that the Lodge is close tiled .) I. G. Brother Junior Warden, the Lodge is close tiled. (This communication is made with the Entered Apprentice sign; the Junior Warden gives three distinct knocks, makes the sign, and says, Worshipful Master, the Lodge is close tiled.) W. M. Brother Senior Warden, what is the next care ? S. W. To see the Brethren appear to order as Masons. W. M. To order, Brethren, as Masons.—Brother Senior Warden, your situation in the Lodge ? S. W. In the West. W. M. Your duty when so placed ? S. W. As the sun disappears in the West to close the day, so the Senior Warden is placed in the west to close the Lodge by command of the Worshipful Master, after seeing that every one has his just dues. W. M. Our Lodge being thus duly formed, before I pro- ceed to declare it closed, let us with all humility and reverence express our gratitude to the great Architect of the Universe for all favours already received ; and may he still continue to support our order, by cementing and adorning us with every moral and social virtue. P. M. So mote it be. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 37 W. M. Brother Senior Warden, our labours being ended, you have my command to close the Lodge. S. W. Brethren, in the name of the great Architect of the Universe, and by the command of the Worshipful Master, I declare this Lodge closed. J. W. It is accordingly so done, and stands closed until the —— barring all cases of emer gency, of which the Brethren shall be apprised by summons. (The W. M., S. W., J. W., I. G., and T., give three knocks in rotation, and pronounce the Lodge closed, and each, lays down the instrument which is the ensign of his authority.) P. M. Brethren, nothing more remains to be done; but, ac- cording to ancient custom, to lo ck up our secrets in the safe and sacred repositories of our hearts, with Fidelity—Fidelity —Fidelity ; and may God be with us. ( The Bible is closed .) A charge is occasionally delivered at the closing of the Lodge by the Master, to the following effect:— When the Lodge is closed you are at liberty to enjoy your- selves with innocent mirth, but carefully avoid excess. Do not compel any Brother to act contrary to his inclination, or give offence by word or deed ; but enjoy a free and easy conversa- tion. Avoid immoral or obscen e discourse, and at all times support, with propriety, the dignity of your character. Be cautious in your words and carri age, that the most penetrating stranger may not discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated ; and, if necessary, wa ive the discourse, and manage it prudently, for the honour of the fraternity. At home, and in your several neighbourhoods, behave as wise and moral men. Never communicate to your families, friends, or acquaintances, the private transactions of our different assemblies ; but, on every occasion, consult your honour, and the reputation of the fraternity at large. Study the preservation of health, by avoiding irregularity and intempera nce, that your families may not be neglected and injured, or yourselves disabled from at- tending to your necessary employments in life. If a stranger apply in the char acter of a Mason, cautiously examine him in such a manner as prudence may direct, and agreeable to the forms establishe d by Masonry, that you may not be imposed upon by an igno rant, false pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt ; and beware of giving him any secret hints of knowledge. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 38 But if you discover him to be a true and genuine brother, respect him ; if he be in want, without prejudice relieve him, or direct him how be may be relie ved ; if you can employ him, do so, or direct him to employment. However, you are not charged to do beyond your ability, only to prefer a poor Mason, who is a good man and true, before any other man in the same circumstances. Finally, these rules are always to be observed and enforced, and also the duties which ha ve been communicated in the lecture. Cultivate brotherly love, the foundation and cope- stone, the cement and glory of this ancient fraternity ; avoid- ing, on every occasion, wrangling and quarrelling, slandering and backbiting ; not permitting others to slander honest brethren ; but defending their characters, and doing them good offices, as far as may be consistent with your honour and safety and no farther. Hence all may see the benign influence of Masonry as all true Masons have done from the be- ginning of the world, and will do to the end of time. Amen, so mote it be. ——— THE SECOND, OR FELLOW-CRAFT’S DEGREE. TO OPEN A LODGE IN THE SECOND DEGREE OF MASONRY , OR A FELLOW - CRAFT ’ S LODGE . (The Master knocks to call att ention, and is answered by the Wardens.) W. M. Brethren, assist me to open the Lodge in the Se- cond Degree.—Brother Junior Warden, the first care of every Fellow-Craft Mason ? J. W. To see the Lodge properly tiled.' W. M.

An angle of ninety degrees, forming the fourth part of a circle. W. M. Since you are so w ell informed yourself, you will prove the Brethren present to be Fellow-Craft Freemasons, by three-fold signs, and demonstra te that proof to me by copy- ing their example. J. W. Brethren, by command of the Worshipful Master, you are desired to prove yourselves Fellow-Craft Freemasons by three-fold signs : and to prevent confusion, observe the Senior Warden ; (all make the signs, and the Junior Warden says :) Worshipful Master, the Brethren present having proved themselves Fellow-Craft Freemasons, by three-fold signs, I, in obedience to yo ur commands, demonstrate that proof to you, by copying their example. W. M. And I acknowledge the correctness of those signs ( repeating them ).

P. M. So mote it be ( and opens the Bible at the ——). W. M. In the name of th e grand Geometrician of the Universe, I declare this Lodge open on the square, for the intruction and improvewent of Fellow-Craft Freemasons. (The Master gives the proper knocks, and is followed by the Wardens, Inner Guard, and Ti ler, and the Brethren take their seats.) CEREMONY OF PASSING IN THE SECOND OR FELLOW - CRAFT ’ S DEGREE . W. M. Brethren, Brother N—— is this evening a candi- date to be passed to the second degree; but it is first requisite "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 40 that he should give proofs of pr oficiency in the former ; 1 shall therefore proceed to put the necessary questions. QUESTIONS REQUIRED TO BE ANSWERED IN THE ENTERED APPRENTICE ’ S DEGREE , AND BEFORE A CANDIDATE IS ELIGIBLE TO BE PASSED TO THE FELLOW - CRAFT ’ S DEGREE . (The Master now puts the following questions of the first degree, and then enquires if any brother has any other question to ask. The candidate is then considered as qualified.) Q. Where were you first prepared to be made a Free- mason ? A. In my heart. Q. Where next prepared ? A. In a convenient room adjoining the Lodge. Q. Describe the mode of preparation ? A. I was deprived of all metal, and hoodwinked ; my right arm, left breast, and left knee made bare ; my right heel slip- shod, and a cable-tow put round my neck. Q. How did you gain admission ? A. By three knocks on the door. Q. Why were you made a Freemason ? A. For the sake of obtain ing the knowledge and secrets preserved among Freemasons. Q. Where were you made a Freemason ? A. In the body of a Lodge, just, perfect, and regular. Q. How do you know yourself to be a Freemason ? A. By the regularity of my in itiation, repeated trials and approbations, and a readiness at all times to undergo an exa- mination, when properly called upon. Q. Since you know yourself to be a Freemason, what means have you of communicating it to others ? A. By signs, tokens, and particular words, which when reciprocally given serve to distinguish a Freemason by night as well as by day. Q. When were you made a Mason ? A. When the Sun was at its meridian. Q. In this country, Fteemaso ns’ Lodges are usually held in the evening, how do you accoun t for this, which at first ap- pears a paradox ? A. The Sun being a fixed body, the earth constantly revolv- "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 41 ing round it on its own axis, it necessarily foIIows, that the Sun is always at its meridi an ; and Freemasonry being uni- versally spread over its surface, it follows, as a second con- sequence, that the Sun is always at its meridian with respect to Freemasonry. Q. What is Freemasonry ? A. A peculiar system of morality, veiled in allegory, and illustrat by symbols. . ——— W. M. Brother N——, you wi ll come this way. Do you pledge your honour as a man, an d your fidelity as a Mason, that you will steadily persevere through the ceremony of being passed to the second degree ? B. N. I do. W. M. Do you likewise pledge yourself that you will con- ceal what I shall now impart to you with the same strict cau- tion as the other secrets in Masonry ? B. N. I will. W. M. Then I will trust you wi th a test of merit, which is, a passing grip and a passing word leading to the door of the Lodge into which you seek to be admitted. The passing grip is given by a distinct pressure of the thumb of your right hand between the joints of the first and middle fingers of the right hand of a brother. This demands a passing word, which is S HIBBOLETH . The word Shibboleth denotes plenty, and is usually depicted in our Lodges by an ear of corn near a fall of water. You will be particul arly careful to remember this word, as without it, you cannot ga in admission to a Lodge in a superior degree. (Brother N—— withdraws, and the Lodge is opened in the second degree, as during his examination and instruction it could only be opened in the first degree. After the examination of the candidate by the Tiler, as to th e passing grip and word, the knock takes place at the door, and the Inner Guard demands who is there, and reports.) I. G. Worshipful Master, at the door of your Lodge stands Brother N——, who has been re gularly initiated into Ma- sonry, and has made such progress as he hopes will recom- mend him to be passed to the degree of a Fellow-Craft, for which ceremony he comes properly prepared. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 42 W. M. How does he hope to obtain the privileges of the second degree ? I. G. By the help of God, a ssistance of the square, and the benefit of a passing word. W. M. We acknowledge the propriety of the aid by which he seeks it. Do you, Brother Inner Guard, vouch that he is in possession of that passing word ? I. G. I do, Worshipful Master. W. M. Then let him be admitted in due form, Brother Deacon. J. D. In the name of the Grand Geometrician of the Uni- verse, enter in due form a Lodge of Fellow-Craft Masons upon the square, an instrument whic h brings rude matter into due form, and as brethren of this de gree are obligated on it, so are they bound by every law, moral an d divine, to act upon it with all mankind, more especia lly a Brother Mason. (The candidate is not now hoodwinked ; but his lef t arm, right breast, and right knee are made bare, and the left heel slipshod.) Brother Dea- con, let the candidate kneel whil e the blessing of Heaven is invoked on what we are about to do. ( Master prays .) We supplicate the continuation of thy aid, O merciful Lord, on behalf of ourselves and of hi m who kneels before thee. May the work begun in thy name be continued to thy glory, and ever more established in us by ob edience to thy precepts. So mote it be. (The candidate is then ra ised, and led three times round the Lodge, that all may see he is properly prepared. As he comes to the Wardens he give s them the pass-grip and word, as at the door, and he is then presented to the Master.) S. W. Worshipful Master, I present to you Brother N—— candidate properly prepared to be passed to the second de- gree. W. M. Brother Senior Warden, you will direct the Senior Deacon to instruct the candidate to advance to the pedestal in due form. S. W. Brother Senior Deacon, it is the Worshipful Master’s command that you instruct the candidate to advance to the east in due form. W. M. Brother N—— as in every case the degrees of Freemasonry are to be kept separate and distinct, another obligation will now be required of you, in many respects similar to the former ; are you willing to take it ? "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 43 Br. N. I am. W. M. Then you will kneel on your right knee, your left foot in the form of a square, yo ur body erect, place your right hand on the sacred volume of the law supporting your left arm with the compasses, the whole forming a square, and say, after nle. I, N. N., in the presence of the Grand Geometrician of the Universe, and in this worshipful and warranted Lodge of Fellow-Craft Masons, duly constituted, regularIy assembled, and properly dedicated, of my own free will and accord, do hereby and hereon most solemnly promise and swear that I will always hele, conceal and never reveal any or either of the secrets or mysteries of, or belonging to, the second degree of Freemasonry, known by the name of the Dellow-Crafts ; to him who is but an Entered App rentice, no more than I would either of them to the uninitia ted or the popular world who are not Masons. I further solem nly pledge myself to act as a true and faithful craftsma n, obey signs, and maintain the principles inculcated in the first degree. All these points I most solemnly swear to obey, without evasion, equivocation, or mental reservation of any kind, under no less a penalty, on the violation of any of them, in addition to my former obliga- tion, than to have my left breast cut open, my heart torn there- from, and given to the ravenous bi rds of the air, or the devour- ing beasts of the field, as a prey : So help me Almighty God, and keep me stedfast in this my great and solemn obligation of a Fellow-Craft Mason. W. M. As a pledge of your fidelity, and to render this a solemn obligation, which would otherwise be but a serious promise, I wIll thank you to seal it with your lips twice on the volume of the sacred law. Your progress in masonry is marked by the positions of th e square and compasses. When you were made an Entered Apprentice, both points were hidden. In this degree one is disclosed, implying that you are now in the middle of Fre emasonry ; superior to an Entered Apprentice, but inferior to what I trust will hereafter be communicated to you. Rise , newly obligated Fellow-Craft Freemason. You, having taken the solemn obligation of a Fellow-Craft Freemason, I shall proceed to intrust you with the secrets of the degree. You will advance towards me as at your initiation. Now take anot her pace with your left foot, "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 44 bringing the rignt heel into its hollow, as before. That is the second regular step in Freemasonry, and it is in this position that the secrets of the degree are communicated. They con- sist, as in the former instance, of a sign , token , and word ; with this difference, that the sign is of a threefold nature. The first part of a threefold sign is called the sign of fidelity, emblema- tically to shield the repository of your secrets from the attacks of the cowan. ( The sign is made by pressing the right hand on the left breast, extending the thumb pe rpendicularly to form a square .) The second part is called the hailing sign, and is given by, throwing the left hand up in this manner ( horizontal from the shoulder to the elbow, and perpendic ular from tlte elbow to the ends of the fingers, toith the th umb and forefinger forming a square .) It took its rise at the time when Joshua fought the battles of the Lord in the valley of Rephidem, and from the memorable event of Moses having his hands supported by his brother Aaron whilst Joshua was fighting the Amalekites. It was also the position of Joshua wh en he prayed fervently to the Almighty to continue the light of day, that lIe might complete the overthrow of his enemy. An cl Moses also, when he came down from the mount, hailed his brethren with this double sign (the first and second part) in or der to arrest their attention, as a signal for them to attend to wh at he was about to deliver, and as a pledge of his sincerity and truth, and also of the import- ance of what he was about to declare. This was the origin of the sign, and on the morning that the foundation stone of the Temple was laid, King Solomon adopted the same double sign : the right hand as a token of the sincerity of his holiness and piety towards God, and the left hand as a token of an upright hand and heart in earnest prayer, imploring the blessing of the Most High on their pious undertaking, in erecting the Temple of Jerusalem to his holy service. The third part is called the penal sign, and is given by draw ing the hand across the breasts and dropping it to the side. This is in allusion to the penalty of your obligation, implying th at as a man of honour, and a Fellow-Craft, you would rather have yonr heart torn from your breast, than to improperly divulge the secrets of this degree. The grip, or token, is given by a distinct pressure of the thumb, on the second joint of the hand or that of the middle finger. This demands a word ; a word to be given and received with the same strict caution as the on e in the former degree, either "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 45 by letters or syllables. The word is J ACHIN . As in the course of the evening you will be called on for this word, the Senior Deacon will now dictate the answers you will have to give. S. D. What is this ? Brother N——. The grip, or token, of a Fellow-Craft Freemason. S. D. What does it demand ? Br. N. A word.. S. D. Will you give me that word ? Br. N.

Brother Senior Warden, I delegate you to invest him with the distinguishing badge of a Fellow-Craft Mason. S. W. Brother N——, by the Worshipful Master’s com- mand, I invest you with the distinguishing badge of a Fellow-Craft, to mark the progress you have made in the science. W. M. Let me add to what has been stated by the Senior Warden, that the badge with wh ich you have just been in- vested, points out to you that as a Craftsman, you are expected to make the liberal arts and scie nces your future study, that you may the better be enabled to discover your duty as a Mason, and estimate the wonderful works of the Almighty. Brother Senior Deacon, you wi ll place our Brother N—— at the south-east part of the Lodge. ( Being so placed, he is thus ad- dressed by the Master .) Brother N——, masonry being a progressive science, when you were made an Entered Apprentice, you were placed at the north-east part of the Lodge, to show that you were newly ad- mitted. You are now placed at the south-east part, to mark the progress you have made in th e science. You now stand, to all external appearance, a just and upnght Fellow-Craft Mason ; I give it to you in strong terms ot recommendation, to continue and act as such, and as I trust the import of the former charge neither is nor ever will be effaced from your me- mory, I shall content myself with observing, that, as in the former degree you made yourself acquainted with the princi- ples of moral truth and virtue, you are now permitted to extend your researches into the hidden my steries of nature and science. —I now present you with the wo rking tools of a Fellow-Craft Mason, which are the square, level, and plumb-rule. The square is to try and adjust all i rregular corners of buildings, and to assist in bringing rude matter into due form. The level, to lay levels, and to prove horizontals : and the plumb-rule to "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 48 try and adjust all uprights, while fixing on their proper bases. As we are not all operative Masons, but rather free and ac- cepted, or speculative, we apply those tools to our morals. In this sense, the square teaches mo rality, the level equality, and the plumb-rule justness and uprightness of life and action. Thus by square conduct, level st eps, and upright intentions, we hope to ascend to those immortal mansions, from whence all goodness emanates. You are now at liberty to retire, in order to restore yourself to your personal comforts, and on your return to the Lodge, I shall call your attention to an explanation of the tracing board, if time will permit. (On his return, he is placed in tlie we st, and returns thanks in the fol- lowing words.) Worshipful Master, Senior an d Junior Wardens, Senior and Junior Deacons, and Brethren of this Lodge, I return you my most hearty and sincere thanks for the honour you have done me this evening, in passing me to the honourable degree of a Fellow-Craft Mason. THE CHARGE IN THE SECOND DEGREE . Brother N——, being advanced to the second degree of the Order, we congratulate you on your preferment. The in- ternal, and not the external qualifications of a man are what masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge, you will consequently improve in social intercourse. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties, wh ich, as a Mason you are now bound to discharge ; or enlarge on the necessity of a strict ad- herence to them, as your own experience must have established their value. It may be sufficient to observe, that your past be- haviour and regular deportment have merited the honour which we have conferred ; and in your new character, it is expected that you will not only conform to the principles of the order, but steadily persevere in the practice of every commendable virtue. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education, which tends so effe ctually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration ; espe- cially the science of geometry, or masonry, origjnally synony- mous terms, is of a divine and moral nature, and enriches with the most useful knowledge ; while it proves the wonderful properties of nature, it demo strates the more important truth of morality. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 49 As the solemnity of our ceremonies requires a serious de- portment, you are to be particul arly attentive to your beha- viour in our regular assemblies. You are to preserve our ancient usages and customs sacred and inviolable ; and induce others by your example to hold them in due veneration. The laws and regulations of the order, you are strenuously to support and maintain. You are not to palliate or aggra- vate the offences of your brethren ; but, in the decision of every trespass against our rules, judge with candour, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with mercy. As a craftsman in our private assemblies, you may offer your sentiments and opinions on such subjects as are regu- larly introduced in the lecture, under the superintendence of an experienced master, who will guard the landmarks against encroachment. By this privilege, you may improve your intellectual powers ; qualify yourself to become an use- ful member of society ; and, like a skilful brother, strive to excel in what is good and great. All regular signs and summonses, given and received, you are duly to honour ana punctually to obey ; inasmuch as they consist with our professed principles. You are to en- courage industry and reward merit ; supply the wants and relieve the necessities of brethren and fellows, to the utmost of your power and ability ; and on no account wrong them or see thenl wronged ; but to apprise them of approaching danger, and to view their interest as inseparable from your own. Such is the nature of your engagements as a Craftsman, and these duties you are now bo und to observe by the most sacred ties. LECTURE ON THE TRACING BOARD IN THE SECOND DEGREE . At the building of King Solomon’s Temple, an immense number of Masons were employed. They consisted of Entered Apprentices and Fellow-Crafts. The entered Apprentices re- ceived a weekly allowance of corn, wine, and oil. The Fellow- Crafts were paid their wages in specie, which they went to re- ceive in the middle chamber of th e temple. They got there by way of a porch, at the entrance of which their attention was particularly struck by two great pillars : that on the left was "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 50 called Boaz , which denotes strength ; that on the right Jachin , which denotes to establish ; and when conjoined, stability ; for God said, in strength will I establish this mine house, to stand firm for ever. The height of those pillars was thirty-five cubits, the circumference twelve, the diameter three. They were formed hollow, the better to serve as archives to Masonry ; for therein were deposited the constitutional rolls. Being formed hollow, the outer rim or shell was four inches, or a hand’s breadth in thickness. Th ey were made of molten brass, and were cast on the plains of th e Jordan, in the clay grounds between Succoth and Zeredatha. The superintendent of the casting was Hiram Abiff. Those pillars were adorned with two chapiters, each five cubits high. Those chapiters were en- riched with net-work, lily work , and pomegranates. Net-work, from the connexion of its meshes, denotes unity. Lily-work, from its whiteness denotes peace. And pomegranates, from the exuberance of their seed denote plenty. Those pillars were further adorned with two spherical balls on which were delineated maps of the celestia l and terrestrial globes. They were considered finished, when the net-work or canopy was thrown over them. They were pl aced at the east of the tem- ple, as a memorial to the children of Israel of the miraculous pillars of fire and cloud, which had two wonderful effects, the fire to give light to the Israelites during their escape from their Egyptian bondage ; the cloud proved darkness to Pha- raoh and his followers when they attempted to overtake them. King Solomon ordered them to be placed at the entrance of the temple, as the most proper and conspicuous situation for the children of Israel, to have th e happy deliverance of their fore- fathers continually before their ey es, at going to and returning from divine worship. After our ancient brethren bad passed those two great pillars, their ascent was opposed by the Junior Warden, who demanded of them the pass-grip and pass-word, leading from the first to the se cond degree. The pass-word, I dare say you recollect, is Shibboleth , and is here depicted by an ear of corn near a fall of water. The word Shibboleth dates its origin from the time that an army of Ephraimites crossed the River Jordan, in a hostile manner, against Jephtha, the re- nowned Gileaditish general. The reason assigned for this un- friendly visit was, that they ha d not been called out to partake of the honours of the Ammonitish war ; but their true aim was "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 51 to partake of the rich spoils with which, in consequence of that war, Jephtha and his army were then laden. The Ephraimites were always a clamorous, turbulent people ; but then broke out in open violence, and after many severe taunts to the Gi- leadites in general, threatened in particular to destroy their victorious commander and his house with fire. Jephtha, on his part, tried all lenient means to appease them, but finding those ineffectual, had recourse to ri gorous ones. He therefore drew out his army, gave the Ephraimites battle, defeated and put them to flight, and to render his victory decisive, and secure himself from the like molestation in future, he sent detach- ments of the army to secure the passages of the River Jordan, over which he knew the insurgents must of necessity attempt to go, in order to regain their own country, giving strict orders to his guards, that, if a fugitive came that way, owning himself an Ephraimite, he should be i mmediately slain ; but if he said nay, or prevaricated, a test word was to be put to him, which was, to pronounce the word S HIBBOLETH . The Ephraim- ites, through a defect in aspirati on peculiar to their dialect, could not pronounce it properly, but called it Sibboleth , which discovered their country and cost them their lives. And Scripture informs us, that there fell on that day, in the field of battle, and on the banks of the Jordan, forty-two thousand Ephraimites ; and as Shibboleth was then a test word to dis- tinguish a friend from foe, King Solomon afterwards caused it to be adopted as a pass-word in a Fellow-Craft’s Lodge, to pre- vent any unqualified person fr om ascending the winding stair- case, which led to the middle chamber of the temple. After our ancient brethren had given those convincing proofs to the Junior Warden, he said, pass S HIBBOLETH , or Brother. They then passed up a winding staircase, consisting of three, five, seven, or more. Three rule a Lodge ; five hold a Lodge ; seven or more make it perfect. The three that rule a Lodge, are the Worshipful Master and hi s two Wardens. The five who hold a lodge, are the Ma ster, two Wardens, and two Fellow-Crafts. The seven who make it perfect are two En- tered Apprentices, added to the former five. Three rule a lodge ; because there were but three Grand Masters who bore sway at the building of the firs t temple at Jerusalem, viz., So- lomon, King of Israel ; Hira m, King of Tyre ; and Hiram Abiff. Five hold a Lodge, in a llusion to the five Noble Orders "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 52 in Architecture, viz., the Tuscan , Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. Seven, or more, make it perfect ; because King Solomon was seven years, and upwards, in building, com- pleting, and dedicating the Temp le at Jerusalem to God’s ser- vice. They have likewise an allusion to the seven liberal arts and sciences, viz., Grammar , Rhetoric , Logic , Arithmetic , Geometry , Music , and Astronomy . After our ancient brethren had gained the summit or the winding staircase, they arrive d at the door of the middle chamber of the temple, which they found open ; but properly tiled by the Senior Warden, agai nst all under the Degree of a Fellow-Craft. After our ancient brethren had given him those convincing proofs, he said, pass S HIBBOLETH , or Brother. They then passed into the middle cham ber of the temple. They went there to receive their wage s, which they took without scruple or diffidence. Withou t scruple, knowing they had justly earned it. Without diffidence, from the unbounded con- fidence they placed in the integr ity of their employers in those days. When our ancient brethren were in the middle chamber of the temple their attention was particularly drawn to certain Hebrew characters, which are now depicted in a Fellow-Craft’s Lodge by the letter G, denoting God, the Grand Geometrician of the Universe, to whom we must all submit, and ought hum- bly to adore.

I was duly presented to the Worshipful Master by the Senior Warden. Q. What said the Worshipful Master ? "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 55 A. I will attend to your presentation, Brother Senior War- den. You will direct the Senior Deacon to instruct the can- didate to advance towards the ea st with his proper steps. That being done, the Worshipful Master said, as the secrets of the different degrees of Freemas onry are at all times to be kept separate and distinct from each other, an obligation will be required of you to preserve inviolate the secrets of this degree from an Entered Apprentice as from the rest of the world : are you ready and willing to take an ob- ligation of this kind ? Answ ering to these questions in a satisfactory manner, I was inst ructed to advance in due form. Q. In what does that form consist ? A. Of certain steps, which I am ready more fully to explain when duly called upon. Q. How many steps ? A. Five winding. Q. What was then done ? A. The Master received me and placed me in the due form of a Fellow-Craft. Q. What is the. nature of that form ? A. Kneeling on the right knee, with the right hand on the sacred volume of God, and a sq uare placed in the left elbow, supported by the compasses. Q. What does that denote ? A. My respective duties to God and the Craft in conformity to my obligation. Q. Which obligation you will be pleased to repeat. The conclusion of the first sect ion is a mere detail of what I have given in the making, and would be tediously repeated here. SECOND SECTION .— First Clause . Q. What was the first instruction you received as a Fellow- Craft Mason ? A. I was first instructed in the history of our ancient fraternity, from the time that it received its present institu- tion. Q. At what period was that ? A. About the year of the world 3000, at the building of the Temple of Jerusalem by King Solomon. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 56 Q. From whence did our present forms arise ? A. From the order observed in classing and distinguishing the multitude of workmen there employed, as well as for pay- ing them their respective wages, as for preserving good govern- ment among them. Q. How many Masons were there in all ? A. Three thousand six hundred, who presided over the or- dinary workmen. Q. How were they distinguished ? A. As Fellow-Crafts and Entered Apprentices. Q. How were they divided ? A. Into lodges or companies of seven Entered Apprentices, or five Fellow-Crafts. Q. How many Entered Apprentices ? A. Two thousand one hundred, making three hundred lodges or companies. Q. How many Fel1ow-Crafts ? A. Fifteen hundred, of whom three hundred were styled Gibeonites, on account of thei r excellent skill as workmen ; and of these three hundred, each presided over a lodge or com- pany of Fellow-Crafts or Entered Apprentices. Q. What wages were given to them ? A. A certain allowance of corn, wine, and oil, to each lodge or company ; besides wages in money to the master of the lodge. Q. Where were those wages received ? A. In the middle chamber of King Solomon’s Temple, to which none but Fellow-Crafts were admitted. Q. How were Fellow-Crafts alone admitted ? A. By means of a pass-word and grip, still preserved among Fellow-Craft Masons. Q. How many Master Masons were there ? A. Three only, to whom the true secrets of a Master were known ; namely, Solomon, Hiram, and Hiram Abiff. Q. Who Wag Hiram ? A. The King of Tyre, and the ancient friend of King David. Q. What part had he in the building ot the Temple at Je- rusalem ? A. He furnished the timbers from the forest of Lebanon, in exchange for stipulated proportions of corn, wine, and oil. He "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 57 also sent his fleet to Ophir to fe tch gold and precious stones for King Solomon, with whom be entered into a strict correspon- dence and reciprocal friendship. Q. Is the correspondence between those two princes pre- served ? A. It is, in the five chapters or the first book of Kings, and the second chapter of the second book of Chronicles. Q. What further assistance dill Hiram give ? A. At the request or King So lomon, he sent a man of con- summate knowledge and skill, who thoroughly understood the principles of every art and science, to preside over the work- men and direct their labours. Q. Who was this extraordinary man ? A. His name was Hiram Abiff. He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Napthali, and hi s father was a man of Tyre. Under his directions was the glorious temple completed in little more than seven years. Q. Where and how were the materials procured ? A. The timbers were felled in the forest of Lebanon, where a levy of thirty thousand me n of Jerusalem were employed by monthly courses of ten thousand : and the stones were cut and wrought in the quarries of the mountains of Judea, by eighty thousand men, assisted by seventy thousand who bare burthens. Q. By what model was this building finished ? A. It was according in all things with the model presented by God himself to King David, the father of Solomon, who ne- vertheless was not permitted to build this sacred temple, as his hands had been stained with blood. Q. When was it begun and finished ? A. It was begun in the month of Zif, in the fourth year of King Solomon’s reign, A. L. 2992, and finished in the month of Bul, or eighth month, in the eleventh year of his reign, A. L. 3000. Q. How was it dedicated ? A. King Solomon celebrated the feast of Dedication with prayer and sacrifice, in the presence of all the people of Israel, and the feast lasted fourteen days. Q. Is the prayer of Dedication still preserved ? A. It is, in the eighth chapt er of the first book of Kings and the sixth chapter of the second book of Chronicles. "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 58 Q. Was it consecrated with any particular marks of divine favour ? A. The divine Shekinah, or brightness, which was a visible token of God’s presence entering the temple from the east- ward, settled over the mercy seat, whereon was placed the ark of the covenant. Clause Two. Q. By what means was the system of masonry extended ? A. Our Grand Master Solomon, observing the effects pro- duced by strict order adopted among the Masons employed in his work, conceived the great idea of uniting the wise and good in every nation, in the bond of brotherly love and in the pur- suit of scientific acquirements. Q. How was he enabled to effect this glorious design ? A. He admitted to the partic ipation of this system those illustrious sages, who resorted to Jerusalem, even from the uttermost parts of the east, to be instructed in his wisdom ; and they, returning to their respective homes, diffused the system of Freemasonry over the whole face of the Eastern Continent. Q. Where did our institution more especially flourish ? A. In Tyre and Sidon, and the whole coast of Phœnicia, under the patronage of Hiram, King of Tyre, and his suc- cessors. Q. Who brought the knowledge of it westward ? A. The Phœnicians, in their co mmerce with this part of the world, spread an imperfect knowledge thereof over the northern coast of Africa and the whole of Europe. Q. Who was the most especial founder thereof in the west ? A. Pythagoras, a Grecian philosopher, born at Samos, about 450 years after the building of King Solomon’s Temple at Je- usalem. Q. What is recorded of him ? A. That he travellecl into Egypt for instruction in the sacred mysteries of the priests of Memphis, and returning by Phœnicia, was there initiated into our purer rites. After which he retired to Italy, and founded the Italian School of Philosophy at Crotona. Q. What masonic observations do we find in his instruc- tions ? "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 59 A. He enjoined his disciples a long probation of silence and inviolate secrecy ; a strict love for, and fidelity towards, each other. He distinguished them by secret signs, and di- vided them into classes, according to their abilities and know- ledge ; but chiefly distinguished them as exoterics and esoterics. Q. What does the first of these appellations denote ? A. Outward hearers , they being admitted to know only a portion of the mysteries, and separated from the higher classes by a veil. Q. What is meant by the latter ? A. Those within the veil, who were permitted to see and hear all things. Q. By what medium were his doctrines illustrated ? A. By the direct and relative qualities and powers of numbers, under which are concealed truths of the greatest importance. Q. What discoveries are particularly attributed to him ? A. The true system of the universe; the foundation of all proportional geometry in the 47th problem of the second book of Euclid ; and other points of science which will be illustrated in their proper places. Q. By whom were the doctrines of Pythagoras received and particularly conveyed ? A. By Plato, an Athenian philosopher, who lived about 150 years after Pythagoras, and d erived his knowledge from the same sources. Q. In what manner were his doctrines conveyed ? A. By means of geometrica l symbols, which have a corre- lative power with the numbers of Pythagoras. TO CLOSE THE LODGE IN THE SECOND OR FELLOW - CRAFT ’ S DEGREE .

CEREMONY OF RAISING A MASTER MASON , OR THE THIRD DEGREE . ( The lodge is open in the Second degree, and the brethren thus addressed by the Master. ) Brethren, Brother N—— is this evening a candidate to be raised to the Third Degree ; but it is first requisite that he should give proofs of proficiency in the former : I shall therefore proceed to put the necessary ques- tions. ( The candidate is then examined as to his proficiency in the former degree, by the Master, and by any other member pre- sent who chooses to question him .) QUESTIONS REQUIRED TO BE ANSWERED IN THE SECOND DEGREE BY A FELLOW - CRAFT FREEMASON , BEFORE HE CAN BE RAISED TO A MASTER MASON , OR THE THIRD DEGREE . Q. How were you prepared to be made a Fellow-Craft ? A. In a manner somewhat similar to the. former degree, "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 63 but with this difference—that I was not hoodwinked, my left arm, right breast, and right kn ee were made bare, my left heel slipshod. Q. On what did you enter ? A. On the square. Q. What is a square ? A. An angle of ninety degrees, forming the fourth part of a circle. Q. For what were your researches in this degree ? A. For the hidden mysteries of nature and science. Q. As it is the hope of re ward that sweetens labour, where did our ancient brethren go to receive their wages ? A. Into the middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple. Q. How did they receive it ? A. Without scruple or diffidence. Q. Why in this peculiar manner ? A. Without scruple, knowing they had justly earned it; without diffidence, from the unbounded confidence they placed in the integrity of their employers in those days. Q. What were the names of the two pillars placed at the porch-way of King Solomon's Temple ? A. That on the left Boaz; that on the right Jachin. Q. That were their separate and conjoint meanings ? A. The former, strength; the la tter, to establish ; conjointly, stability. W. M. Brother N——, will you come this way? Do you pledge your honour as a man, an d your fidelity as a Mason, that you will steadily persevere through the ceremony of being raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason ? Brother N——. I do. W. M. Do you likewise pledge yourself that you will conceal what I shall now impart to you with the same strict caution as the other secrets in Masonry ? Br. N. I will. W. M. Then I will instruct you with a test of merit, which is a pass-grip and a pass-word, leading to the degree into which you seek to be admitted. The pass-grip is given by a distinct pressure of the thum b between the joints of the middle and ring fingers. This demands a pass-word, which is T UBAL C AIN , who was the first artificer in metal ; and the import of the word is worldly possession . Yon will be par- "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 64 ticularly careful to remember this word, as without it, you cannot gain admittance into a lo dge, in a superiur degree. ( Brother N—— retires to be prop erly prepared, which is to have both of his arms, breasts, and knees bare, and both heels slip-shod. In the interim the lodge is opened in the Third Degree. The same ceremonies take place at the door, as in the former degrees, with, the difference of the distinc- tive grip word, knocks, &c., and, the Inner Guard reports to the Master .) I. G. Worshipful Master, Br other N—— is at the door of the lodge, who has been regular ly initiated into Masonry, passed the degree of a Fellow-Craft, and has made such pro- gress as he hopes will recommend him to be raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason, for which ceremony he comes properly prepared. W. M. How does he hope to obtain the privileges of the Third Degree ? I. G. By the help of God, the united aid of the square and compasses, and the benefit of a pass-word. W. M. We acknowledge the powerful aid by which he seeks it ; do you, Brother Inner Guard, vouch that he is in possession of that pass-word ? I. G. I do, Worshipful Master. W. M. Then let him be admitted in due fonn. ( He is then admitted ) Brother Deacons, let the candidate kneel while the blessIng of heaven is in voked on our proceeclings. ( He kneels and the Master prays .) Almighty and Eternal God, the Architect and Ruler of the Universe, at whose creative fiat all things first were made : we, the frail creatures of thy providence, humbly implore thee to pour down on this convocatio n assembled in thy holy name, the continual dew of thy blessing ; and especially, we beseech thee, to impart thy grace to this thy servant, who offers him- self a candidate, with such fortitude that in the hour of trial he fail not ; but pass him safely under thy protection through the valley of the shadow of deat h, that he may finally arise from the tomb of transgression, to shine as the stars for ever and ever.—So mote it be. W. M. The brethren will take notice, that Brother N——, who has been regularly initiated in Freemasonry, and has passed the degree of a Fellow-Craft is about to pass in view "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 65 before them, to show that he is properly prepared to be raised to the Third Degree. ( He is then, conducted three time round the lodge by the Deacons. At the first time he shows the sign of the first degree to the W. M. : then the first sign with the grip to the J. W.

Brother N——, a candidate properly prepared to be raised to the sublime De- gree of a Master Mason. W. M. Brother Senior Warden, you will direct the Dea- cons to instruct the candidate to advance to the pedestal in due form. S. W. Brother Deacons, it is the Worshipful Master’s command that you instruct the candidate to advance to the East in due form. W. M. It is but fair to info rm you, that a most serious trial of your fortitude and fide lity, as well as a most solemn obligation, await you ; are you pr epared to meet them as you ought ? Br. N. I am. W. M. Then you will kneel on both knees, place both hands on the volume of the sacr ed law, repeat your name at length, and say after me:— I, N—— N——, in the presence of the Most High, and of this worthy and worshipful lodge, duly constituted, regularly assembled, and properly dedicated, of my own free will and ac- cord, do hereby, and hereon, mo st solemnly promise and swear, that I will always hele, conceal, and never reveal, any or either of the secrets or mysteries of, or belonging to, the Degree of a Master Mason, to anyone in the world, unless it be to him or them to whom the same may justly and lawfully belong ; and not even to him or them, until after due trials, strict exam- ination, or full conviction, that he or they are worthy of that confidence, or in the bosom of a Master Mason’s Lodge. I fur- ther, most solemnly engage, that I will keep the secrets of the Third Degree from him who is bu t a Fellow-Craft Mason, with the same strict caution as I wi ll those of the Second Degree "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 66 from him who is but an Entered Apprentice Free Mason : the same, or either of them, from anyone in the known world, unless to true and lawful Brother Masons. I further solemnly engage myself, to advance to th e pedestal of the square and compasses, to answer and obey all lawful signs and summonses sent to me from a Master Mason’s Lodge, if within the length of my cable-tow, and to plead no excu se except sickness, or the press- ing emergency of my own private or public avocations. I fur- thermore solemnly pledge myself, to maintain and support the five points of fellowship, in act as well in word ; that my hand given to a Mason shall be the sure pledge of brotherhood ; that my foot shall traverse through da nger and difficulties, to unite with his in forming a column of mutual defence and safety ; that the posture of my daily supplications shall remind me of his wants, and dispose my heart to succour his distresses, and relieve his necessities, as far as may fairly be done without detriment to myself or connexions ; that my breast shall be the sacred repository of his secrets, when delivered to me as such ; murder, treason, felony, and all other offences contrary to the law of God, or the ordinances of the realm, be- ing at all times most especially excepted, or at my own option : and finally, that I will support a Master Mason’s character in his absence as well as I would if he were present. I will not revile him myself, nor knowingly suffer others to do so ; but will boldly repel the slanderer of his good name, and strictly respect the chastity of those who are most dear to him, in the persons of his wife, sister, or his child : and that I will nof knowingly have unlawful carnal connexion with either of them. I furthermore solemnly vow and declare, that I will not de- fraud a Brother Master Mason, or see him defrauded of the most trifling amount, without giving him due and timely notice thereof ; that I will also prefer a Brother Master Mason in all my dealings, and recommend him to others as much as lies in my power, so long as he sha ll continue to act honourably, honestly, and faithfully towards me and others. All these se- veral points I promise to observ e, without equivocation or mental reservation of any kind, un der no less a penalty, on the violation of any of them, than to have my body severed in two, my bowels torn thereout, and burnt to ashes in the centre, and those ashes scattered before the four cardinal points of heaven, so that no trace or remembrance of me shall be left among men, "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 67 more particularly among Master Masons : So help me, God, and keep me stedfast in this gr and and solemn obligation, being that of a Master Mason. W. M. As a pledge of your fidelity, and to render this binding as a solemn obligation for as long as you shall live, I will thank you to seal it with your lips three times on the vo- lume of the sacred law. ( This is done .) Let me once more call your attention to the position of the square and compasses. When you were made an Entered Apprentice, both points of the compasses were hidden. In the Second Degree, one was disclosed. In this Degree, the whole is exhibited, implying, that you are now at liberty to work with both these points, in order to render the circle of your Masonic duties complete. Rise, newly-obligated Master Mason. Brother N——, you having now solemnly entered into an obligation of a Master Mason, are entitled to demand of me that last and greatest trial by which alone you can be admitted to a participation of the secret s restricted to the Third Degree of Masonry. But it is my duty, previously, to call your at- tention to a retrospect of those Degrees in Masonry through which you have already passed, whereby you will be enabled to distinguish and appreciate the connexion of our whole system, and the relative dependence of its several branches. Your ad- mission among Masons, in a state of helpless indigence, was an emblematic representation of the entrance of all men upon this their mortal existence. It inculcated the striking lesson of natural equality and mutual dependence. It taught you, in the active principles of universal beneficence and charity, to seek the solace of your own distress, and to extend relief and con- solation to your own fellow creatures in the hour of affliction. It enabled you to free the soul from the dominion of pride and prejudice, and to look beyond the narrow limits of particular institutions, whether civil or reli gious, and to view in every son of Adam a brother of the dust. Above all, it taught you to bend with humility and resignati on to the Great Architect of the Universe, to dedicate your heart, thus purified from every malignant passion, and to prepare for the reception of truth and wisdom, to his glory and the good of your fellow creatures. Proceeding onwards, and still guided in your progress in the principles of moral truth, yon were passed into the Second De- gree of Masonry, wherein you were enabled to contemplate the "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 68 intellectual faculties, and trace them from their development through the paths of heavenly science, even to the throne of God himself. The secrets of na ture, and the principles of mo- ral truth, were thus unveiled be fore you. You learn the just estimate of those wondrous fa culties with which God has en- dowed the being formed after his own image, and feel the duty which he has thereby impressed on yo u, of cultivating this divine attribute with the most diligent and unremitting care and at- tention, that you may be enable d to show forth his glory, and render yourself useful to the happiness of mankind. To the man whose mind has thus been mo delled to virtue and science, nature presents one great and useful lesson more— the knowledge of himself . She prepares you, by contemplation, for the clos- ing hours of existence, and when by means of that contempla- tion, she has conducted you thro ugh the intricate windings of this mortal life, she finally inst ructs you how to die. Such, my brother, are the peculiar objects of the Third Degree in Free- masonry. They invite you to ref lect on this awful subject, and teach you to feel that, to the ju st and virtuous num, death has no terrors equal to the stain of falsehood and dishonour. Of this grand truth, Masonry afford s a glorious example in the un- shaken fidelity and noble death of our Master, Hiram Abiff, who was slain just before the co mpletion of King Solomon’s Temple, at the construction of which you, no doubt, are well aware, he was the principal arch itect. The manner of his death was as follows:— Fifteen Fellow-Crafts of that superior class appointed to preside over the rest, finding that the work was nearly com- pleted, and that they were not in possession of the secrets of the Master’s degree, which were only known to Solomon, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, conspired together, to ohtain them by any means, and even to have recourse to vio- lence. At the moment of carry ing their conspiracy into execu- tion, twelve of the fifteen recanted ; but three, of a more deter- mined and atrocious character than the rest, persisted in their impious design, in prosecution of which, they planted them- selves respectively. at the east, north, and south entrances of the Temple, whither our Master Hiram Abiff had retired to pay his adoration to the Most High, as was his wonted custom at the hour of high twelve. His devotion being ended, our Grand Master attempted to "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 69 return by the north door, but found himself opposed by the first of the three ruffians, who, for want of another weapon, had armed himself with a heavy pl umb-rule. In a threatening manner he demanded of our Grand Master the secrets of a Mason, declaring to him that his death would be the consequence of a refusal ; but Hiram Abiff, true to his obliga- tion, replied that those secrets were known only to three, and could only be made known by consent of them all ; that dili- gence and patience could not fa il to entitle the worthy Mason to participate in those mysteries , but that he would sooner suf- fer death than betray his sacred tr ust. On receiving this answer the ruffian aimed a blow at his he ad, but, startled by the firm- ness of his demeanour, it missed the forehead, and only glanced upon his right temple, yet with such violence, as to cause our Grand Master to reel and sink on his left knee. Recovering from this situation, he rushed to the south door, where he was accosted bv the second ruffian in a similar manner, and an- swered as before, with undiminished firmness ; when the as- sassin, who was armed with a le vel, struck our Master Hiram a blow on the left temple, which brought him to the ground upon his right knee. Finding hi s escape thus cut off in both these quarters, he staggered faint and bleeding to the east door, where the third ruffian was posted, who, on receiving a similar reply to his insolent demand (f or our G. M. still remained un- shaken even in this trying mome nt), struck him a violent blow full in the middle of the forehead with a heavy setting maul, under which thig excellent man su nk lifeless at the foot of the murderer. Such was the manner of his death ; and I have already pointed out to you the instructive lesson which his death and fortitude so powerfully inculcate in the heart of every faithful brother. Such, in like circumstances, will be the magnanimity of every man whose mind is well constituted, who squared his life upon the principl es of moral truth and justice : who, by improving his faculties in the glory of God, and the good of mankind, has answered the great end of his creation, and has learned to contemplate death as the end of afflictions, and the entrance to a better life. Nor will you, I trust, sink beneath the influence of terror, no w that your trial approaches ; though you stand before me a devoted victim ; though the hand of death be upon you, and thou gh this awful moment be your last. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 70 ( At this part of the ceremony the brother is struck on the fore- head, and thrown down ; and, while shamming a dead man, the Master thus proceeds. ) The brethren will take notice that, in the recent ceremony, as well as in his present situation, our brother has been made to represent one of the brightest characters recorded in the an- nals of Masonry ; namely, our Master, Hiram Abiff, who lost his life in consequence of his unshaken fidelity to the sacred trust reposed in him. And I hope this will make a lasting impression on his and your minds should you ever be placed in a similar state of trial.—Brother Junior Warden, you will endeavour to raise the representa tive of our Master Hiram by the Entered Apprentice’s grip. ( He takes him by the forefinger, and then lets it slip from his hand .) J. W. It proves a slip, Worshipful Master. W. M. Brother Senior Warden, try the Fellow-Craft’s grip. S. W. It proves a slip also, Worshipful Master. W. M. Brother Wardens, havi ng both of you failed in your attempts, there yet remains a third method, namely, by taking a firm hold of the sinews of his hand, and raising him on the five points of fellowship, of which, with your assistance, I will make a trial. ( The Master then raises him by grasping, or rather clawing his hand, or wrist, by putting his right foot to his foot, his knee to his knee, bringing up the right breast to his breast, and with his hand over the back .) This is practised in masonry as the five points of fellowship. W. M. It is thus all Master Masons are raised from a figu- rative death to a reunion with the former companions of their toils. Let me now beg you to ob serve that the light of a Master Mason is darkness visihle, servin g only to express that gloom which rests on the prospect of futurity. It is that mysterious veil which the Eureka of human reason cannot penetrate, unless assisted by that light which is from above. Yet even by this feeble ray you may perceive that you stand on the very brink of the grave into which you have just figuratively descended, and which, when this transitory life shall have passed away, will again receive you into its cold bosom. Let the emblems of mortality which lie before you, lead you to contemplate your inevitable destiny, and guide your reflection to that most inter- esting of human study, the knowledse of yourself. Be careful "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 71 to perform your allotted task while it is yet day ; continue to listen to the voice of nature, which bears witness, that even in this perishable frame resides a vital and immortal principle, which inspires a holy confidence that the Lord of Life will en- able us to trample the king of t errors beneath our feet, and lift our eyes to the bright morning star, whose rising brings peace and salvation to the faithf ul and obedient of the human race. You are now at liberty to retire, in order to restore yourself to your personal comforts, and on your return into the lodge, the signs, tokens, and words shall be explained to you, and the history resumed. ( On returning into the lodge, Brother N—— is desired to ap- proach the Worshipful Master as an E. A. and F. C., who thus addresses him:— ) I cannot better reward the attent ion you have paid to the exhortation and charge, than by intrusting you with the secrets of this Degree. You will adva nce towards me as a Fellow- Craft. Take another pace with your left foot, and bring the right heel into its hollow, as be fore. That is the third regular step in Freemasonry, and it is in this position that the secrets of the degree are comnlunicated. They consist of signs, tokens, and words. Of the si gns, the first and second are casual, the third is penal. The first casual sign is called the sign of horror, and is given from the Fellow-Craft’s hailing sign, by dropping the left hand and elevating the right, as if to screen the eyes from a painful sight, at the same time throwing the head over the right shoulder, as a remove or turning away from that sight. It alludes to the finding of our murdered Master Hiram by the twelve Fellow-Crafts. The second casual sign is called the sign of sympathy or sorrow, and is given by bending the head a little forward, and by striking the right hand gently on the forehead. The third is called the penal sign, because it alludes to the penalty of your obligation, and is given by drawing the hand across the ce ntre of the body, dropping it to the side, and then raising it again to place the point of the thumb on the naval. It implies that, as a man of honour, and a Master Mason, you would rather be severed in two than im- properly divulge the secrets of this Degree. The grip or token is the first of the five points of fellowship. The five points of Fellowship are : first, a grip with the right hand of each other’s "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 72 wrist, with the points of the fing ers : second, right foot parallel with right foot on the inside : th ird, right knee to right knee : fourth, right breast to right breast : fifth, hand over shoulder, supporting the back. It is in this position, and this only, except in open lodge, and then but in a wh isper, that the word is given. It is M AHABONE or M ACBENACH . The former is the ancient, the latter the modern word. ( Brother N—— is now conducted to the S. W., who presents him to the W. M .) S. W. Worshipful Master, I present to you Brother N——, on being raised to the sublime Degree of a Master Mason, for some further mark of your favour. W. M. Brother Senior Warden, I delegate you to invest him with the distinguishing badge of a Master Mason. S. W. I now invest you with the distinguishing badge of a Master Mason, to show that you have arrived at that sublime Degree. W. M. I must state that the badge with which you have now been invested, not only poi nts out your rank as a Master Mason, but is meant to remind you of those great duties which you have just solemnly engaged yourself to observe ; and while it marks your own supe nority ; it calls on you to afford assistance and instruction to your brethren in the infe- rior Degrees. ( Brother N—— is then conducted back to the W. M., who says ) I now present you with the working tools of a Master Mason, which are the skirret, pencil, and compasses. The skirret is an implement which acts on a centre pin, from whence a line is drawn, chalke d, and struck, to mark out the ground for the foundation of the intended structure. With the pencil, the skilful artist delineat es the building in a draft or plan for the instruction and gu idance or the workmen. The compasses enable him with accuracy and precision to ascertain and determine the limits and proportions of its several parts. But as we are not operative, but speculative, or free and ac- cepted, we apply those tools to our morals. In this sense, the skirret points to us that straight and undeviating line of con- duct laid down for our pursuits in the volume of the sacred law. The pencil teaches us that our words and actions are observed and recorded by the Almighty Architect, to whom we must "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 73 give an account of our conduc t through life. The compasses remind us of his unerring and im partial justice, which having defined for our instruction the limits of good and evil, will reward or punish us as we have obeyed or disregarded his divine commands. These, the working tools of a Master Mason, teach us to have in mi nd, and to act according to the laws of the Divine Creator, th at when we shall be summoned from this sublunary abode, we may ascend to the Grand Lodge above, where the world’s great Architect lives and reigns for ever. We left off at that part of our traditional history which men- tioned the death of our Master Hiram. A loss so important as that of the principal architect could not fail of being generally and severely felt. The want of those plans and designs, which had hitherto been regularly supplied to the different classes of workmen was the first indication that some heavy calamity had befallen our Master. The Masters or Presidents, or, familiarly speaking, the Overseers, deputed some of the most eminent of their number to acquaint King Solomon with the utter confu- sion into which the absence of Hiram had plunged them, and to express their apprehensions, that to some fatal catastrophe must be attributed his sudden and mysterious disappearance. Solomon immediately ordered a general muster of the workmen through the different departments, when three of the same class of Overseers were not to be foun d. On the same day, the twelve Crafts who had originally joined in the conspiracy came before the king and made a voluntary confession of all they knew down to the time of wi thdrawing themselves from the conspiracy. This naturally inc reased the fears of King Solo- mon for the safety of the chief artist. He, therefore, selected fifteen trusty Fellow-Crafts, and ordered them to make diligent search after the person of our Master Hiram, to see if he was yet alive, or if he had suffered death in the attempt to extort from him the secrets of his exalted degree. Accordingly, a stated day having been appointed for their return to JerusaIem, they formed themselves mto three Fellow-Craft’s Lodges, and departed from the three entrances to the Temple. Many days were spent in fruitless search, and one class returned without having made any discovery of importance. A second was more fortunate, for on the evening of a certain day, after they: had suffered the greatest privations and personal fatigues, one of "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 74 the brethren rested himself in a reclining posture, and in order to assist his rising, caught hold of a sprig that grew near, which, to his surprise, came easily out of the ground. On a closer examination, he perceived that the earth had been re- cently disturbed ; he, therefore, hailed his companions, and, with their united endeavours, reopened the ground, and found the body of our Master Hiram very indecently interred. They covered it again, with all respec t and reverence, and, to distin- guish the spot, struck a sprig of ca ssia at the head of the grave. They then hastened to Jerusalem, to impart the afflicting intel- ligence to King Solomon, who, when the first emotion of his grief had subsided, ordered them to return, and raise our Mas- ter Hiram to a sepulchre as became his rank and exalted talents : at the same time inform ing them, that by his untimely death, the secrets of a Master Mason were lost. He therefore charged them to be very careful in observing whatever casual sign, token, and word, might occu r while paying this sad office of respect to departed merit. They performed their task with the utmost fidelity, and on re- opening the ground, one of the brethren looked round observed some of his companions in this situation ( showing the sign of horror ), as struck with hor- ror at the afflicting sight. While others viewing the ghastly wound still visible on his foreh ead, smote their own in sympa- thy of his sufferings. Two of the brethren then descended the grave and attempted to raise him by the grip of an Entered Apprentice, which proved a slip. They then tried the Fellow- Craft’s grip, which also proved a slip. Having both failed in their attempts, a zealous and expert brother took a more firm hold by the sinews of the hand wrist, and with their assistance raised him on the Five points of Fellowship : while others, more animated, exclaimed Mahabone or Macbenach , both words having nearly a similar import,—one signifying the death of a brother , the other, the brother is smitten . King Solomon, there- fore, ordered, that those casual si gns, tokens, and words, should designate all Master Masons throug h the universe, till time or circumstance should restore the genuine ones. It now only remains to account for the third class, who had pursued their researches in th e direction of Joppa, and were meditating their return to Jeru salem, when accidentally pass- ing the mouth of a cavern, they heard sounds of deep lamen- tations and regret. On entering the cavern to ascertain the "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 75 cause, they found three men answ ering the description of those missing, who, on being charged with the murder, and finding all chance of escape cut off, made a full confession of their guilt. They were bound and led to Jerusalem, where King Solomon sentenced them to that death which the pernicious- ness of their crime so ampJy merited. Our Master Hiram was ordered to be re-interred as near the sanctum sanctornm as the Israeli tish law would permit ; and there, in a grave, from the cent re three feet east, three feet west; three feet between north and south, and five feet or more per- pendicular. He was not buried in the sanctum sanctorum, because nothing common or unclean was suffered to enter there, not even the High Priest, but once a year, nor then, till after many washings and purifica tions against the great day of expiation of sins ; for by the Israelitish law, all flesh was deemed unclean. The same fifteen Fellow-Crafts were or- dered to attend the funeral, cl othed in white aprons and gloves, as emblems of innocence. The ornaments of a Master Ma son’s lodge are the porch, dormer, and square pavement ; the porch is the entrance to the sanctum sanctorum ; the dormer, the window that gives light to the same ; and the square pave ment for the High Priest to walk on. The office of the High Priest is to burn incense to the honour and glory of the Most High, praying fervently, that the Almighty, through his benign wisdom and goodness, would be pleased to bestow peace and tranquillity to the Israelitish nation for the ensuing year. You have already been informed of the working tools with which our Master Hiram was slai n. They were the plumb- rule, level, and heavy maul. Th e coffin, scull, and cross bones being emblems of mortality, allude to the untimely death of our Master, Hiram Abiff. You have likewise been informed of three signs in this De- gree. The whole are five, corresponding in number with the five points of fellowship. They are the sign of horror, the sign of sympathy, the penal sign , the sign of grief and death, and the sign of joy and exulta tion, likewise called the grand and royal sign. For the sake of regularity, I will go through the whole. This is the sign of horror ( described ). This is the sign of sympathy ( described ). This is the penal sign ( described ). The sign of grief and death is given by passing the hand over the "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 76 forehead. It took its rise at the time when our Master Hiram was making his way from the nort h to the south entrance of the Temple, when his agonies were so great, that the perspiration stood in large drops on his face, and he made use of this sign as a temporary relief to his suffering s. This is the sign of joy and exultation ( to raise both hands over your head, and exclaim, O Worthy Masons ! ) It took its rise at the time the Temple was finished, when King Solomo n and the princes of his house- hold went to view it, and being so struck with its magnificence, that with one simultaneous feeling, they exclaimed— O Worthy Masons ! LECTURE IN THE THIRD DEGREE . Q. How were you prepared to be made a Master Mason ? A. Both my arms, both breast s, both knees made bare, and both heels slip-shod. Q. On what did you enter ? A. Upon both points of the co mpasses presented to both my breasts. Q. On your entrance into the lodge did you observe anything different from its usual appearance ? A. I did : all was dark, save one glimmering light in the east. Q. To what did that darkness allude 1 A. Even to the darkness of death.. Q. Am I given to understand that death is the peculiar sub- ject of this Degree ? A. You are. Q. From what circumstance ? A. From the untimely death of our Master Hiram Abiff. Q. What were the instruments made use of at his destruc- tion ? A. The plumb-rule, level, and heavy maul. Q. How came you in possession of those secrets ? A. From having figuratively represented him when I was raised to the sublime Degree of a Master Mason. Q. How were you raised ? A. Upon the five points of fellowship. Q. Which I will thank you to name, and afterwards briefly explain. "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 77 A. 1st, hand to hand ; 2d, foot to foot; 3d, knee to knee; 4th, breast to breast ; and 5th, hand over back. 1st.—Hand to hand, I greet you as a brother ; and when the necessities of a brother call fo r my aid and support, I will be ever ready to hand him such assi stance to save him from sink- ing, if I find him worthy thereof, as may not be detrimental to myself or connexions. 2d.—Foot to foot—I will suppor t you in all your just and laudable undertakings. Indolence shall not cause my footsteps to halt, nor wrath to turn them aside. But forgetting every selfish consideration, I will be ever swift of foot to save, help, and to execute benevolence to a fellow-creature in distress ; but more particularly to a Brother Mason, if worthy. 3d.—Knee to knee—being the posture of my daily suppli- cations, shall remind me of your wants. When I offer up my ejaculations to Almighty God, a brother’s welfare I will re- member as my own ; for, as the voices of babes and sucklings ascend to the throne of grace, so most assuredly will the breath- ings of a fervent heart ascend to the mansions of bliss, as our prayers are certainly received for each other. 4th.—Breast to breast—that my breast shall be a safe and sacred repository for all your ju st and lawful secrets. A bro- ther’s secrets, delivered to me as such, I would keep as my own, as to betray that trust might be doing him the greatest injury he could sustain in this mortal life ; nay, it would be like the villany of an assassin, who lurks in darkness to stab his adversary, when unarmed and least prepared to meet an enemy. And, 5th.—Hand over back—tha t I will support a brother’s character in his absence, equally as though he were present. I will not wrongfully revile him myself, nor will I suffer it to be done by others, if in my power to prevent it. Thus, by the five points of fellowship, are we linked together in one indi- visible chain of sincere affection, brotherly love, relief, and truth.

PART II. ————————— INTRODUCTION. ———————— I N exploring the cause of secret associations, and the disor- ders among mankind, I find it in the want of that truly one thing needful , HUMAN CULTURE. That every human being born is not duly cultivated up to the extent of equality of knowled2e, as far as capacity to acquire is in question, is most certainly the crime of the rulers of the state. That the means to such an end are as available as the culture of the soil, or the necessity of labour to that end, is a circumstance most evident. The plea of usef ul ignorance is not to be tole- rated ; for it is the boast of a ll rulers, that their mental cul- ture and qualification give them the right to rule, and that the mass of the people are not in a mental condition to manage their own affairs by the electi on of representatives for that purpose. The root of a ll tyranny and oppression, of all social and human ills, is found in the withholding from the masses of each community mental culture, or knowledge that may be conferred on all. To th is may be added, the evils arising from a wrong direction, as the consequence of super- stition, or mistakes about anci ent language, customs, and cere- monies prevailing among, and influencing the actions of, mankind. That one great scheme for th e necessary culture of the human race has been propounded, I find a proof in the foundation of the Christian relig ion. Not that superstitious resting upon the letter of the Old and New Testament, and the traditions of the Grecian or Roman Church, which now "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 81 and for centuries have made up what is miscalled the Christian Religion; but THAT REVELATION which is embodied in all the mysteries of all the sacred writings, in all the customs, ceremonies, and traditions of all the Churches within or beyond the misca lled Christian era, which re- veals nothing contrary to the evident and immutable princi- ples of nature and the relative condition of man ; the first and final principle of which is, the eternal necessity of the mental culture of each succeeding generation, since mind is not a heritable property, independent of cultivation, but must, season after season, be sown and planted, nurtured, weeded, pruned, and formed, in each human being. Looking at the language of th e gospel, or God’s mystery, and putting an interpretation on that language, which shall become equal to a revelation or a truth, I find the declara- tion, that a second birth—birth of mind or mental culture, is distinguished from first birt h, or birth of body from the parent—is essential to human salv ation from evil. I find this declared to be the incarnation of God or Christ in man. I find the word worship as a relation between God and man, to be significant of nothing more than mental culture , such being its root in all languages, and such being the only sense in which any action upon that word can realise an evident good. I find prayer to signif y the necessary labour to ac- quire knowledge. I find the word repentance , when etymolo- gically traced to a root, to be of precisely the same meaning ; as applicable to the culture of mind, signifying reflection , consideration , animadversion , and, when referable to a condi- tional future state, as referable only to that better future state of mankind that is to be prod uced when all are made Chris- tians or reasonable men, by due culture, in the acquirement of knowledge. I find the promise of peace and good-will among men, which most certainly has no t been realised in any place yet called Christendom, to be a promise founded on the reality of Christianity, or of equal kn owledge, and all its high accom- paniments. The true advent of Ch rist is only to be historically realised by a necessary state of the human mind. It is re- served for the human race to be the creator of Christ, which is a principle, that of reason or intellect ; and not a man, or any other being, independent of that principle. Christ comes from the worship of God, which means, when the words have a "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 82 meaning, and a natural and rational application, the best culture that can be made of th e human mind, the best action that can be educed from the man . I find the word soul to have no other true meaning than the word mind , no other physical origin or existe nce. It may be made immor- tal by cultivation ; without cultivat ion, it can be scarcely said to be born,—there is no second bi rth. The first is the physical birth ; the second, cultivation, an affair of art, the birth of mind or soul. The Christianity of ma n is wholly artificial, moral, or the produce of art. Even so have been all superstitious notions and the direful mistakes about Christianity. The kingdom of Heaven must be the moral work of human art founded upon honesty. It has nothing to do with physics, but in human knowledge of physical powers. It is in the birth of mind alone that virgin birth, or immaculate concep- tion, can be truly imagined. The Pagan Mythos illustrates this in the birth of Minerva, while the salutation, submission, overshadowing, conception, blessing, and annunciation, or thanksgiving, breeding and birth of Christ by the Virgin Mary, form but another version of that beautiful mythos, ever preg- nant with physical truth and a ll its moral applications. The miracles and teachings of Christ are : the first, mythological , developments of physical nature ; the second, the moral duties of human nature . It is the principle that teaches, and not the example or power of man, by knowledge in the form of a mystery or allegory, or even of Christ in man, to make su- pernatural changes or appearance s. It is the knowledge of the principle in man that teaches the moral duty. The ar- raignment, condemnation, crucifixion, passion, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension, are but figures of the consequences that follow the labours of reason in seeking to reform the con- dition of man, of the institutio ns, churches, and states of so- ciety. The moral is purely political, and superstition cannot make a truth of it in any other shape. Such is not only true Christianity, but such is true Ma- sonry. Though I still deprecate all se cret associations, all oath- makings, or absolute promises, as not necessary to the present welfare of English society, I have , by research, arrived at quite another general view of Masonry, to that which I took on first ex- posing it in the year 1825, while a prisoner in Dorchester gaol. "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 83 I then dealt with it as I and ot hers were then dealing with the letter of the Old and New Test aments. Not knowing the spirit of the allegory, I knew nothing more than the historical defects and other improprieties of the letter : that letter which St. Paul, in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, chap. iii. verse 6th, says, killeth , or leadeth the mind to confusion and de- struction, as distinguished in meaning from that spirit, or reve- lation of the allegory of the New Testament, which giveth life or true knowledge. To know the letter, to carry the whole Bible in the memory, is still to be as ignorant as the man who never saw or heard of it, unless there be a knowledge of the spirit, revelation, or the meanin g of its allegory ; because the letter of the moral precepts is nothing more than was taught by the philosophers of all nations, who never saw or heard of either Old or New Testament, as recorded in the Bible. Such also is Masonry. To fo llow the ritual and routine of all the degrees, to have the language in memory, and to be able from memory to practise all its required steps, positions, grips, or motions, just amounts to nothing at all, in the making of a true Mason. As with the Bible, the spirit or revelation of the allegory of Masonry is required, both as knowledge and prac- tice, to make out the character of a real Mason. A true Mason is the same character as a true Christian. That character is formed by the ac quisition of all possible know- ledge, with the benevolent desire of extending it among the whole human race; that recogni ses in every man a brother who has need of every other man’s good-will and assis- tance. We have now among those who claim the distinc- tion, neither practical Masons nor practical Christians. All are misled with the delusions of the letter, ritual, or ce- remony ; none understand the spirit or revelation of the al- legory. Having negatived, in various publications, discourses, and discussions, the assumption that the Bible is a book of histo- rical record, standing prepared to meet any call or challenge upon that head, I affirm it to be an emanation from the an- cient mysteries, and precisely similar in its character to the ritual of Masonry. It is a myst ery, an allegory, or a series of mysteries, and allegories, that requires a revelation. That revelation is not in the book , is not now in any Masonic "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 84 Lodge ; but it should be in the Church, it should be in each Masonic Lodge, it should be in the mind of every man. It would be nonsense to publish a mystery and revelation together, because the revelation is sufficient to all practicable purposes without the mystery ; but wherever there is mys- tery, in writing or in the ritual of ceremony, there a reve- lation is essential to be know n, as the true meaning of the matter, or nothing useful is known. The true meaning, then, of th e revelation of the mysteries of Judaism, Christianity, and Ma sonry, is, that man is a crea- ture to be improved by cultivation ; that knowledge of things is the source of improvement ; an d that time is the material to be properly used to that end ; la bour the means of application ; any existing thing an instrument to be worked with and com- prehended. Toward the accompli shment of the practice of this revelation, the exhortations of Masonry, as of the Bible, are equally good ; but unfortun ately for those concerned, the letter or mystery has engaged too much attention—has been made of too much importanc e—has been ignorantly sub- stituted as the “one thing n eedful,” for the spirit or re- velation ; the human race has been thereby much damaged, has fallen from a better state, and requires to be raised by the spirit, revelation, knowledge, or better state or mind. The mind that could construct a mystery developing so much important instruction under the form of an allegory, must have been a higher and bette r state of mind than that of those who have ignorantly followed the letter or mystery without knowing what it meant, and to whom the spirit or revelation has been wanting. This is evidence of a fall, in the order of generations of the race, from a higher state. The spirit or revelation possesse d will carry us back to all those advantages which earlier races must have had, when superstition had no authority, and when science was the pride of man. As to the history of Masonry, I am not now disposed to limit its existence to any time, nor to confine its origin to any place. Knowing and proving that Christianity was known as a mystery, before the era called Christian, that Judaism finds no resting-place on earth before the time of "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 85 Alexander of Macedon, except in the conclave of the mysteries ; and, seeing that the ritual of Masonry is wholly formed from, or as the Bible mystery, I can as readily believe, that Ma- sonry has truly emanated from the ancient mysteries of Egypt and other countries, as I can so believe of Judaism, Christianity, or the Bible. Indeed, I cannot otherwise ac- count for the present character an d existence of Masonry. To believe otherwise, I must believe that which I do not believe, that some one in modem times, or a hundred years ago, has understood the spirit and revelation of the Bible. The two forms of the mystery so coming down, side by side, afford me a proof that there has been none of the devotees of either equal to the understanding of th e spirit or revelation. The letter of either is full of superstition, nothing but superstition has been built upon it. There is more in the spirit or reve- lation. Hence I award to Ma sonry a rank in antiquity, meaning, and purpose, with Ju daism, Christianity, or the Bible. I am not insensible how great is the difficulty to the pre- sent general state of mind, in any effort to comprehend this question in the position here taken. It is like every other kind of knowledge, dark and apparently difficult to those who are ignorant—clear and easily comprehended to those who understand. The very language necessary to state the case, is a novelty to the present generation. It is equivalent to the statement of a new science, for which words are, at first, much wanted. It is ne cessary to know something of mythology and theology to approa ch the subject. It is ne- cessary to know much of the divinity of ancient history. It is necessary there should be knowledge enough of the phy- sical sciences to raise the in dividual above the despicable slavery of superstition. Some knowledge of ancient languages becomes necessary, as, the more knowledge of ancient lan- guage, the more easily to be comprehended is the science of mystery and revelation, of letter and spirit, of prophecy and interpretation, of theology and gnomology. The ritual of Masonry, like the Old and New Testaments, has its two-fold lecture on theology and gnomology ; the first, a mysterious discourse about God, and the relations of the physical to the moral worl d ; the second, the moral pre- cepts and exhortations of the polit ical and social duties of "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 86 man toward man. The building of Solomon’s temple, which is the gist of Masonry, in its physical allusion, signifies the gaining a knowledge of the physical world ; in its moral allusion, signifies the best te mple that can be made of the human body, by culture or product of mind. The letter, figure, or instruments of the symbolization, just mean nothing at all in relation to the subject of the secret or spirit ; thus it is called sacred, mysterious, &c. As practical workman- ship in the letter, it is symbolical of the labour of acquiring knowledge. As apparent history of the past, it is the history of principles ascertained, which affect alike all people, at all times, in all climes and countr ies. Hence the spirit of pro- phecy is most truly founded on the knowledge of those prin- ciples, so that every real Jew, real Christian, or real Mason, becomes a prophet, and prophecies most truly in the name of Lord or God ; Lord or God here meaning the knowledge that has been acquired ; that kn owledge being, to its degree, a picture of the physical or moral power, born, deified, and personified in the man or prophet. In the degrees of Masonry, we begin with the Entered Apprentice, which signifies a beginning to learn . Then comes the Fellow-Craft, which signifies something learnt and applied , under the direction of a Master. The degree of Master im- plies a capability to teach or to direct instruction . The Royal Arch completes the philosophic character, and is the acme of the Masonry of the present Grand Lodge. And all that the Templar degrees of the Christia n orders can add, is a new form of the allegory. The Grand Lodge Masonry of the present day is wholly Jewish. But a full understanding of the subject presents the three orders of Judaism, Christianity, and Masonry, as one and the sa me allegorical scheme for hu- man improvement. All the particulars of Freemasonry being now laid before the public eye, there remains not the shadow of an excuse or reason why it should be co ntinued as a secret associa- tion. The legislature being about to deal with other secret societies, would do well now not again to make an excep- tion of Masonry. And Masonry, now no longer a secret, had better deal with the revelation than the mystery, and devote its united powers to public instruction. Having done for Masonry what I have also do ne for the Jewish and Chris- "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 87 tian religions, the Old and Ne w Testaments, shown how it may be made respectable and us eful, I seriously propose to the Masonic Lodges, that they allow me to come among them, and openly and publicly to lecture among them on the subject. I cannot consent to go through any of their obliga- tions, because they are neither legal nor moral ; but I offer to give a scientific and moral explanation of those principles of Masonry which are the true revelation of their mysterious language. My exposure of Freemasonry in 1825 led to its exposure in the United States of America ; and a Mason there of the name of William Morgan, having announced his intention to assist in the work of exposure, was kidnapped under pretended forms and warrants of law, by his brother Masons, removed from the State of New York to the borders of Canada, near the falls of Niagara, and there most barbarously murdered. This hap- pened in 1826. The States have been for many years much excited upon the subject ; a regular warfare has arisen between Masons and Anti-Masons ; societies of Anti-Masons have been formed ; newspapers and magazines started ; and many pamphlets and volumes, with much correspondence, published ; so that, before the Slavery Question was pressed among them all parties had merged into Ma sons and Anti-Masons. Several persons were punished for the ab duction of Morgan ; but the murderers were sheltered by Masonic Lodges, and rescued from Justice. This was quite en ough to show that Masonry, as consisting of a secret associat ion, or an association with se- cret oaths and ceremonies, is a political and social evil. While writing this, I have been informed that individual members of Orange Lodges have smiled at the dissolution of their Lodges, with the observatio n, that precisely the same as- sociation can be carried on under the name of Masonry. This is an evil that secret associations admit. No form of anything of the kind, when secret, can protect itself from abuses ; and this is a strong reason why Masonic associations should get rid of their unnecessary oaths, re vise their constitutions, and throw themselves open to public inspection and report. There is enough that may be made respectable in Masonry, in the present state of mind and customs, to admit of scrutinising publicity. The common mistake of the superstitionists, under the name "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 88 of Jew and Christian, has been to read the Sacred Scriptures as pieces of profane history, instead of understanding them to be fane or temple history, hist ory of universal principles relat- ing to the whole human race, an d not a record of the acts of the people of any particular time or country. All such records are distinguished as profane, or something recorded of indivi- dual human action, beyond or without the business of the temple, and are further styled uncanonical and apocryphal. Profane history is the truth of human action in particular times and places, and of a particular people. Sacred history is the Catholic record of principles, for the guidance of mankind through life, not appertaining or confined to any particular peo- ple, but presenting the principles of nature, or what is known of God, to the Catholic or un iversal instruction of the human race. The disposition of the mi staken Jew is to monopolise his portion of the Sacred Script ures, as a charm or benefit pre- pared and presented to his people in their sectarian character. The disposition of the nominal Christian, though mistaking, as between sacred and profane histor y, has latterly been to freely circulate his Sacred Scriptures, ever to proselyte the Gentiles or people of all nations, and to bring them within the sphere of his imagined benefits. The Chri stian is, therefore, of the two, the more philanthropic character, in the abstract ; though, in his zeal for conversion of mind, or uniformity of creed, he has been practically a most intolerant and furious destructive, which the Jew, in his selfish se nse of peculiar and exclusive advantage, with relation to Deity, has not been. But this has been the mistake both of Jew and Christian. Reading their Sacred Scriptures in their true mythological character, receiv- ing the inspiration of their spirit and their truth, understanding what they reveal, the Jew and the Christian become one and the same character as to the acknowledgment of principles ; and originated their first distinctions in the spirit of two rival phi- losophical sects, the basis of whose philosophy was the same. Under that spirit of distinctio n, they have sadly persecuted each other, the weaker party being the greater sufferer ; and superstition springing up as a weed, where their original phi- losophy ceased to be cultivated,—the four quarters of the globe have been swamped with human blood, instead of having been cultivated into a paradise. The reign of Christ and the Jewish Messiah, one and the same prince, has still to begin. May it "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 89 soon begin, and may all be united on sound principles under that reign. The Messiah or Christ, will be the reign of the Logos, or principle of reason among men. It is then the truth, defensible by physical science, by histori- cal science, and by moral science, that the Bible, in its theological character is wholly, independent ly, entirely, exclusively, a my- thological book ; and that, from the name of Adam to the name of Jesus Christ, in the supposed line of Jewish descent, there is not the name of anyone human being that has lived and passed the stage of life ; every such na me being the name of a princi- ple, relating to the human co ndition; and the whole corres- ponding in character with what we have ignorantly, and contemptuously, because ignorantly , styled the thirty thousand gods and goddesses of the Pagan world. Christianity was a philosophical improvement on the general mythology of Pagans and Jews, in asmuch as it aspired to the encircling of the whole human race within the influence and reign of the best principles ;. a high cultivation of the mind, as the necessary foundation of a ll that is desirable in manners . Oh ! what a fall, from that he ight down to the present super- stition ! Masonry has been more like Judaism, professing the pos- session of a benefit, which has been exclusively held under the guise of secrecy or mystery ; bu t which, had it been better un- derstood as a system of morality veiled in allegory and illus- trated by symbols , would have been passionately extended to the whole human race. In the first three degrees of Masonry, the Entered Apprentice , Fellow-Craft , and Master , we find the ceremonies, the sym- bols, and the language, founded upon the Scriptures of the Old Testament are wholly Jewish, relating to the building of Solo- mon's Temple ; which, in its r elation to human nature, is a figurative allusion to the buildi ng up of the temple of the hu- man mind, or, as Josephus desc ribes that temple, “an allego- rical picture of all that is known of physical and moral phenomena.” Another meaning signifies a temple to be a convenient building, containing all the necessary implements, both as to men and things, for the culture of the human mind, of which a Masonic Lodge is an emblem, an d should be a reality ; and which also should be the practica l and applicable character of "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 90 the building called a Christian Ch urch ; thus harmonising that system which is now mistakenly pregnant and productive of the most bitter dissent ; and instructing those sects which profess to hold something important, the true secret, revelation, or meaning of which they know no t, and cannot apply to their advantage. But the inner and more important meaning in which the word Temple is to be, understood, as Solomon’s Temple , the House of God , Church of Christ , Temple of the Holy Ghost , Kingdom of Heaven , is the mind of man, cultivated from time to time in the best possible manner, and productive of the best possible effects, making, in fact and truth, a Temple of Reason. This is the meaning of the secret, or sacredness, or sacrament of the Scriptures of both Old and New Testament, and the mystery of Masonry. Each and all is one and the same thing as to prin- ciple. No such building as Solomon’s Temple according to the literal reading of the Books of Kings and Chronicles in the Bible, was ever raised in that country now called Judea ; but the mythological sketch existing, a colony of men, called Jews, under the protection and sanction of the Ptolemies of Egypt, about two thousand years ago, di d build a temple on a spot of ground in Syria or Palestine, which was called the Second Temple, and became subject to the fate of all such structures ; and at or after the building of that temple, the name of Jerusa- lem was first given to the city by which it was to be surrounded, and the name of Judea to the district of land that had pre- viously been called Palestine : the former Jerusalem having meant nothing more than a mytholog ical city, as it is explained in the fourth chapter of the Epis tle to the Galatians, and in the Book of Revelation, a Jerusalem, or City of Peace yet to be built. In coming to the fourth, or fifth, if the Master’s Degree be considered one, the Royal Arch Degree becomes a link or step as between Judaism and Christianity ; the Logos or WORD in relation to Christ, is more distinctively introduced ; and the building of the Second Temple, described as the Lord’s Temple, which, in relation to Judaism, is meant to signify the Temple of Christianity ; the temple of Judaism as the first in relation to the second, passing under the distinction of a bond- age, captivity, absence of freedo m, or a temple of the law ; a distinction without a real difference arising from the sectarian spirit, as between the nominal Jews, and Christians, but made "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 91 symbolical of the progress of hu manity from ignorance to know- ledge ; and, in the sense of a former fall, from knowledge or observance of the laws of God or nature, to the bad habits of superstition and ignorance. Masonry has been considered complete in the Royal Arch Degree, and even in the Master’s Degree ; but the spirit of sectarianism, so difficult to be kept out of human systems of philosophy, has created new deg rees, under the distinction of Christian or Cross Degrees, originating the various ancient sys- tems of knighthood, as knights of the various coloured crosses, Knights Templar, Knights of Ma lta, &c. These degrees of orders of knighthood were cert ainly at one time engaged in active and cruel warfare with the followers of Mahomet, and were beaten in the end ; but there is a higher and moral or mental distinction applicable to the whole fraternity, and that is, the better sense of symbolical philosophy, in which the cross is understood as the great symbol of science; the enemies of the cross, as the tyrants who seek to subdue the mind of man, and subject it to superstition ; and the knights, or soldiers of the cross, as the scholars of th e earth chivalrously warring with ignorance and superstition, and exposing themselves to all the dangers and sufferings consequent thereon. This view leaves us a true picture of human nature; and as we go on to subdue superstition, we shall be enabled to make a beautiful develop- ment of ancient symbolical myth ology, and to unlock and open the correct history of the past with the key of science, or those cross keys of physical and mora l science—the keys of life and death, of heaven and hell, the key-stone of Royal Arch Ma- sonry, of which, in the scheme of Christian symbols, St. Peter is the custos, that rock on which the church of Christ is to be built. I shall, in this volume, give the order of Knights Templar as the most prominent order in the cross degrees of Masonry, but shall reserve the multifarious degrees of both Testaments, that have been constructed and observed as portions of Ma- sonry, for the contents of another. The curious reader, in the interim, may find them roughly sketched, if he can obtain that now scarce and much sought work, the twelfth volume of the “Republican;” of the pecuniary value of which, while compiling it in Dorchester Gaol , I had not an idea, or I might have made it a source of great profit. It is not now to be "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 92 purchased, unless with the set of fourteen volumes at five pounds. The advent of the Jewish Messi ah, the advent of Christ, and the advent of a reasonable state of society, in which mystery and superstition shall yield to plain practical science, in the constitution of the human mind, are to be one and the same reality, the moral of the mystery of Judaism, Christianity, and Masonry. If the nominal Jew, Christian, or Mason, aim at or expect anything else, he will die deceived through life. It is one of the immutable laws of nature, that no other kind of advent that can save from evil shall happen. This is the key to the mystery of Judaism, of Christianity, and of Masonry. Each party avows mystery in hi s ceremonies, of which he is morally ignorant ; each professe s to be waiting for the deve- lopment of that mystery ; and each will never understand and agree with the other without the use of the key I offer, to unlock the whole of the myst eries. I trace the sacred ad- mission of the principle throughout Masonry, throughout the New Testament, and throughout the Old Testament. The plan of each is ‘the proper culture and discipline of the human mind ;’ and ‘get knowledge, get wisdom, get salvation, get liberty,’ is the motto, marrow, key, and substance of the whole. Deliverance from bondage, from darkness, from ignorance, from evil, is the effort to be made ; and Jehovah, Jesus, Lord, or Logos (reason), the principle, or help, or means to be sought as necessary to accomplish the end. Man has it all to do for himself ; and this he is clearly taught in the Bible, and in the Masonic mystery. He cannot either deserve or obtain it but by qualifying himself. The revelation of Masonry has been one of the means by which I have been led on to a fu ll revelation of the Judaic and Christian mysteries. The mysteri es are all purely of a mytho- logical character. If not so, th ey are not to be at all under- stood. So understood, the key or revelation is the reason of science applied to symbolical language. Why the mysteries were invented and followed—why knowledge was so secretly and ceremoniously communicated, is not the question now to be settled. Apologies may be found in the poetic pleasure of similitudes ; in the dramatic amusement afforded ; in the importance which the lower state of the human mind has ever attached to things with difficult y obtained ; in the spirit of "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 93 tyranny, aristocracy, priestcraft, and sectarianism ; in the love of the marvellous, which predom inates where human nature is left ignorant ; and on many oth er grounds. I see, with a per- fect sight, the whole of ancient mysteries ; and a true reve- lation of them will, by-and-bye, form a delightful history of the human race, and illuminate that darkness which has been formed in the human mind, by a resting of the letter of some of those mysteries as profane historical fact. That which the enlarged mind of ancient genius could symbolize by virtue of its inspiration, as the history of principles inci- dent to human existence, under the form of united similitudes of physical and moral nature, well suited to man's instruc- tion, when understood, has by erring ignorance, guided by cunning, deceitful, and plundering priestcraft, been adopted as a literal history of the human race, and a record of all its action. The mistake has b een the same, as if any other poetic or mythological picture ha d been taken for the reality, instead of the spirit or princip le of an existence ; as if Venus had embodied all the love, and Mars all the spirit of war that had existed in the human world ; instead of understand- ing that Venus is a name given to that principle of love which is diffused through human life ; and Mars a name for the evil spirit of war which, lamentably, has too much pre- vailed and has been too much encouraged by human beings so erring and misled. As Mine rva was a name given to the principle of wisdom, insufficiently scattered in the human character, miraculously born from and immaculately con- ceived in the brain of Jupiter ; so precisely is the whole character and history of Jesus Christ, the only-begotten but not made son of God. In th e latter case, the instrumenta- lity of the Virgin does not change the spirit of the Mythos. The whole mythological family of every nation will be found true to nature, in the delineation or revelation of principle. And this is all that is necessary to be learnt by those who meddle with ancient writings and symbols. In so meddling, we deal with the poetry, page antry, and customs of ancient men, who, we should ever remember, lived on the same planet as we live on, and saw the same external and internal things only which we now see, having no other existences about them than those we now have, on an d of which to construct their language. I see and prophecy, th at this general view of the "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 94 mythological, theological, or myst erious subject, is the only one that can make a brotherhood of the human race, by leading them to truth. In standing forward as the harb inger or prophet of this the greatest of all the advents that have yet blessed the human race, it must be seen that I stand clear of all bad motive, and have sufficiently studied the current of human nature in society, so as not to delude myself with any hope of a living reward, or any thing beyond that memorable stone hereafter, which is commonly the useful man’ s substitute for the want of bread here. I have passed through all the defects of Supersti- tion, of Deism, of Atheism, of Materialism ; I renounce all such names and distinctions, as far as they make systems in the mind. I hate secrecy, abhor concealment of knowledge, and have so far studied as to know that man is born ignorant, and has need of mental culture, that knowledge is his one thing need- ful ; that it is criminal to withhold any kind of knowledge, in its due season for use, from any human being ; assured, that nothing but a near approach to an equality of knowledge can be a near approach to an equa lity of high condition for the human race, to all that they ha ve called coming peace, good- will, and paradise. I see a plan for this approach to an equality of knowledge in the mythological rudiments of the Christian scheme, and without wi shing to be thought at all alike in character with those who have wrongfully usurped the title, I declare myself to be in reality a Christian, free from su- perstition, the cultivator of science not to be monopolised, but to be extended to all who can receive it. In that same sense, I am a Mason ; in the same, a Je w. A name has never formed the basis of brotherhood, it must be sought in the extended knowledge of the necessary principle. It is not person, but principle , that we ought to study. It is not a history of the human race that can serve us ; but a history of the principles that have led it to good or to evil ; and this is what the Bible, and all other mythological books and mysteries, were meant to teach. In this spirit, and with this knowledge, I call upon Masons to take me by the hand, and to make their association of more importance than they have yet made it. Let them not wait to be disbanded by the Legislatu re, as a useless and mischievous association ; but let them anticipate the spirit of a coming age, "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 95 and assist me in the union of all the mysteries, by this one great revelation of universal applic ation. Our grip shall be the sign of wisdom ; our word shall become a quickening spirit ; and we shall realise the old ma sonic sentiment of (intellectually) setting the world on fire . The deluge of mystery has not only overwhelmed Babylon, but Egypt, Greece, Rome, and will, if we do not light up the spirit of revelation in time, most as- suredly overthrow this British nation. It is even now in dan- ger, from the dissension of its internal mysteries, of becoming an easy prey to some more barbarously mysterious power. Thus fell Babylon, Egypt, J erusalem, Greece, Rome, and why not Britain, if Britain retain those seeds of disease and weak- ness ? Tell me not, that the safety of a country is in its su- perstition, or in its secret and my sterious bands ; I know it to be safe only, where knowledge is dispersing its superstition and mysteries, in a submission to, an d a unity of sentiment founded upon, that knowledge. If the bigot will not yield to reason, he will be sure to draw the sword of civil war, or traitor-like, call in a foreign aid to further his wickedness or madness. This has been every where the case ; th is is what is taught by the moral of the mysterious death of Hiram Abiff, and of Jesus Christ ; and this it will be well that we rightly comprehend, in due season, to save our country, and leave a land to our pos- terity. To get rid of the myst eries, will be to make a holy land of every country. This is revelation. The spirit of the warfare am ong the cross degrees of Ma- sonry, means a warfare with superstition and mystery. The meaning of the church militant is lost to those who have made a mystery of Christianity, without retaining the revelation. The church militant is the chur ch of people fighting against error, mystery, superstition, idol atry, with no other weapon than revelation, knowledge, reaso n, where that is sharp enough. The sword of steel should never be used but on the defensive. I claim the distinction of having been the best and most endur- ing soldier of Jesus Christ that the church has produced within these last fifteen hundred years, a true and trusty Knight Templar, using the right weapons in the right way. I read, in the year 1834, from the Knight Templar, and Masonic tomb-stones, in the ruins of the Chapel of Holyrood- House, at Edinburgh, that Masonry has been a pure, though mysterious. descent from the ancient mysteries; retained in "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 96 letter, practised in ceremony, but not understood in revelation. In the Antiquarian Museum of that city, I saw specimens of the cross dug up in Scotland, th at were wreathed as symbols of science, and evidently older than the Christian era. I saw the rude pulpit of John Knox, and lamented that such a fana- tical brute had ever gained power in Scotland, to make the ceremony of mystery more fanatically mysterious and mischiev- ous. I saw a brighter past in Scotland, than the whisky-spirit of the present devotion to mystery will allow to be recovered through a long future. The late lamented O’Brien has in his “Essay on the Round Towers,” sh own as much of Ireland ; and died a lamentable instance of genius smothered and mur- dered by ignorant an(l wicked mystery. I either inherited or prepared a set of nerves suitable to the task I had to perform, and the persecution to be endured. Ten years of imprisonment have not destroyed me. Retiring from the murky, deathly atmosphere of the London winter, I feel as young and as spirited as ever. I wi ll continue the fight, and will not be killed, while a “crust and Christ” can be found. The difficulty I feel in making progress is, that learned im- postors shrink from discussion , and abuse the ignorance which they rule by calumniating the honesty and courage that, with more learning, seeks to instruct. The position which I take with every man is, a desire to instruct him, or to be instructed by him. If any other view be ta ken of my character, it stands misrepresented. In assailing wh at I have discovered to be su- perstition, I have, from time to ti me, used what I have felt to be the most powerful weapons. If I have varied the use of my weapons it has been from no other motive than to work more effectually. I have learnt to think with Paine, that false- hood is not entitled to complaisance ; and I have most con- scientiously spurned all acquaintance with hypocrisy, wicked- ness, and unsteadiness of charac ter. That I have made more enemies than friends, I am w ell informed by painful experi- ence ; for I have found ignorance and hypocrisy to be the rulers of the world. But that I have found some most valuable friends, sustaining, satisfying, sympathising, cheering, that have made me feel life worth preserv ing, and man in general as wor- thy of the struggle I have made for his better future welfare, it would not only be ingratitude in me to deny, but I cannot do so, as I almost daily enjoy the company of a few such characters. "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 97 The true secret of universal brotherhood must be in equality of knowledge, and honesty of it s application. All other pre- tence is trick, deceit, and ine fficiency.—Masonry, in its mys- terious ceremony, makes this pretence ; but it is a failure, every where a failure, in relation to universality. And it is only by construing the spirit of Masonry to mean a universal equality of knowledge, that its profession of brotherhood can be sustained. The field of ancient science, which a true knowledge of mythology opens to our view, is the only redemption we have from present superstition. Stro ng minds, by their own scienti- fic perceptions, may see through superstition ; but the multi- tude of this day is not strong of mind, and wants careful direc- tion to abate its fears, to appease its alarms, and to unfold to its understanding the realities of past, present, and future. Let the Synagogue, the Church, and the Masonic Lodge, be- come schools for that purpose. Let mystery be sunk by sci- ence, and imposture by honesty, that a bleeding and starving world may have some hope of be tter state in the future of this, instead of being cheated into contentment with ignorance and misery here, under the delusion of attaining happiness hereafter. The immediate present and to-morrow, is that which it becomes man to be earnestly providing for. This, my playing Knight Templars, is making up the charac- ter of a real Christian soldier ; and I hope to see and to say— CONSUMMATUM EST. THE TAU AND THE CROSS . The Tau is a figure constructed of five lines, thus | , and is considered an important emblem or badge in Royal Arch- Masonry. It is also styled a Tr iple Tau, or Triple Cross; the Tau of the Greek being like the T of the Egyptian, Roman, or English Alphabet. There were other forms of the Cross. One was the Crux Ansata, thus Ð ; another tripled thus In some, there were circles attached to each end thus and thus : a cross within a circle, thus , . The Roman X , "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 98 or Cross of St. Andrew ; the Cro ss Keys of St. Peter, and all the varied figures of the Cross, found in Heraldry, are symbols of science, or keys of mystery . In every recorded mythology or religion, one or the other form of the Cross has been adopted ; and from the most ancient Phalic ceremonies and processions, down to the superstition of the present day, it has been the im- mediate symbol worshipped. Life may be said to have two departments, or to be of two distinct kinds—the physical and the moral ; the sensual and the intellectual ; the latter growin g out of, and being closely in- tertwined with the other. Supers tition has inverted the order, and made the latter the creative power. of the former ; the in- tellectual of the sensual, or the mo ral of the physical. This is the grand mistake ! All the evidences of nature are to the con- trary, and leave to man the spirit of liberty, choice in many cir- cumstances—a soul, reason, Chri st, and moral responsibility ; while the former is the doctrine of fatality, carried through both the physical and moral world, leav ing man no spirit of liberty, no choice, no soul, no reason, no Christ; a mere helpless, use- less, predestinated or fatal c reature, without moral responsi- bility : for if a superior, immutable, intellectual power has designed, that power is alone responsible for what happens. Such a doctrine is the invention or mistake of man, and has no warrant in science. It is a mistake made about the ancient mythology. In reasoning from what we know, we cannot reach a knowledge of anything of an intellectual character preceding or equal to physical power. Intellectual power is human art, applied to the varyin g or extension of effects by other combinations of physical causes, than those which phy- sical nature presents to us. I ma intain, that no true science or morality can be taught on any other general ground. The science of symbols teaches us, that the same symbols may be made or meant to repres ent the two departments of life. For instance; the great or der of creation and preserva- tion is, both physically and morally, of a generative kind. The Cross, in varied figures, might have been, as it has been, made to represent both department s ; the physical, as the first principle—the moral or intellectual, as the second principle of life ; the first and second birt h of the New Testament. Then, as an emblem, the figure or sy mbol may be made an instru- ment for abuse in the indulgence of sensual excesses, as "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 99 it has by mistake been made an instrument of abuse in superstitious or devotional excesses. It may even be abused in intellectual excesses, which often endanger the physical organization, and lead to insanity. This will ac- count for all the various abuses, uses, and views that have been made and taken of mythological symbols. Human nature may and does use and abuse every thin g that can be subjected to its sphere of action ; and the only remedy available and applicable, is proper intellectual culture, which is the true and best religion—the best pastime, the best filling up of the hours of life not required in sleep, in th e cultivation of the earth, and preparation of other necessary comforts. The grand question for man to solve is, how can the time of human life be best spent ? The Triple Tau has been adopted by the Jewish, or Old Testament order of Masonry ; the Cross, by the Christian, or New Testament order. In original meaning and general ap- plication, they are one and the same symbol of science, denot- ing what is known of physics by the intellectual or moral, what- ever addition can be made to th at knowledge. Here we see also the union of principle in Judaism and Christianity. And how appropriate is the symbol of a key or cross to the unlock- ing, not only of those mysterie s which scientific men have con- structed in language ; but also that knowledge , or the search of it , is the key wherewith to unlock all the mysteries of physical nature, which are mysteries as far as we are ignorant, but which cease to be mysteries as we acquire knowledge. Know- ledge is the one thing needful ; the lost word sought in Ma- sonry ; but truly has superstition misdirected the human mind, and caused a fall from the an cient knowledge possessed and signified by symbols. Let all go in pursuit of knowledge, and thus harmonize human dissent and its evil consequences. Men agree in and teach whatever they know : they dissent only where both parties are ignorant, and neither can explain the mystery of ancient language and symbols. As we see that the Cross is th e symbol of science, we reach the grand denouement of the meaning of the conversion of Con- stantine, the Roman Emperor. The story goes, and is told in the Cross-degrees of Masonry, th at Constantine saw a figure of the cross in the heavens, with an inscription, In hoc signo vinces : By this sign or symbol, thou, shalt overcome ; and that this sight converted him from Paganism to Christianity. We now see "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 100 that the Cross was originally a Pagan symbol, and could have been nothing new to Constantine . The moral of it, as here presented in the name of Constantine, is, that by science man may overcome all the difficultie s that wait on his ignorance . This, if any, was the discovery or development to the mind of Constantine. And this was the tr uth so desirable to be known by all men. The Christian relig ion was introduced in this way, and carried on by symbols. Ancient ecclesiastical his- tory is full of them. Here we have a wheel within a wheel, as to the cross and inscription sa id to have been seen by Con- stantine in the heavens. Not only is the phrase, In hoc signo vinces , most strictly applicable to the power of knowledge or reason ; but in the initials of th e words, we have the celebrated I. H. S., which the Latin Fathers translated, Jesus hominum Salvator , or Jesus the Saviour of man ; but which is traced to the Pagan altars of Bacchus, as a Greek inscription of the letters, Iota , Eta , Sigma , signifying Yes , or Saviour. In the inscription of the Cross as said to have been seen by Constan- tine, we have only to take up and add the initial of vinces , and we make the Latin Jesu . It is thus the whole thing called the Christian religion, throughout its nomenclature, has been con- structed : this is what it is in principle ; and nothing of it as it has been read according to the letter, as a piece of profane history, has been true. The name of Jesus is found to be a Pagan name, or the Greek for Saviour ; as Christ has also a root in the Greek language signifying Anointed . Jesus Christ, the Saviour Anointed, that is, ch osen by mankind : in which, in the rendering, that the salvation consists of knowledge or reason, none better can be found to be adopted or anointed. Here is nothing peculiarly of Jewish origin ; but of Grecian de- duction, corresponding precisely with the parallel Mythos of Prometheus bound and unbound. All books and epistles de- nominated Christian, have come down to us from the Greek language. We cannot trace one of them into the Hebrew lan- guage, or that of the Jews, though we can trace the principle upon which the Mythos is constructed into Persia, Hindostan, and among very anciently know n people from the Hindoo to the Druids of this island. Th e Jews have the same Mythos in their Jehovah, Moses, David, &c. It is the Mythos Logos, the mysterious power of reason or intellect in the human being, emanating from the mysterious or unknown power of the phy- sical universe."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 101 Modern, self-styled Masons have played with the symbols of this mysterious science without understanding, and conse- quently without making of it any useful application : they have, in fact, used it to their injury . The same may be said of mo- dern, self-styled Christians and Jews. A full development of this mistake is now, for the first time, made known, and I in- vite to its aid the criticism and di scussion of all existing talent. Let it not be considered as anything of mine ; but let it be ex- amined as if it had an anonymous author. Through ignorance of its mystery, many defects and ana- chronisms have crept into the c eremonies of Modem Masonry. Without having seen the interior of a Masonic Lodge, I could correct them, by virtue of my knowledge of the true Masonic Science. I have done so in the Royal Arch Degree accompa- nying this introduction, as I had to make it up from many va- rying forms used in this country and in America. In my pre- sent edition of the Royal Arch Degree, there is nothing out of order, and nothing that is valued, omitted. As my pursuit of Masonic Science is closely coincident with my general warfare with superstition, further elucidations of the subject may be expected from me ; but I should prefer to send them forth in the shape and practice of Lectures among Ma- sons, as some preparatory initiation, by education somewhere, is essential to the full understanding of the mythological matter. I have among my Masonic illust rations, many definitions of the Tau, such as that it me ans—T. H. or Templum Hieroso- lyma, Temple of Jerusalem; that it means a treasure, or a place in which the treasure is deposited. These are but sym- bolical meanings of the symbol . The true literal and moral meaning is the key to science, or the diving of the intellectual power into the physical mysteries , and thus obtaining revela- tion. It has been described as the Nilometre, an instrument by which the waters of the Nile, at their overflowing, were measured. As T. upon H. it may be defined as the cross upon the name of Jehovah, or the mystical union between the Father and the Son, the letter H representing Jehovah, or the Father. This would be still but a symbol or mystery ; and what we want is the revelation of the mystery, which we can only find in reading it as a symbol of science. That man is physically born ignorant, and has need of intel- lectual cultivation, is the root and foundation of all useful "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 102 knowledge. Superstition has smothered for a time this the first necessary item of knowledge. It must be redeemed be- fore human society can recover its lost position. We have in the church and its property all the machinery necessary where- with to re-commence the suspende d task ; and as the property is a public one belonging to th e whole people, there can be no ground of exclusion or want of qualification because of poverty. It is the fallacious boast in th e ceremony of Masonry, that it may be obtained without money. The candidate is de- prived of everything valuable, and received only as a figure of humility ; as a picture of the human mind proceeding from ignorance to knowledge. A thorough series of Masonry should represent the creation of the earth, &c. ; of man and woman, by the Logos or Jeho- vah ; the disposition of Jehovah, that man should be happy as the cultivator of the soil ; the possession of the Garden of Eden; the loss of that possession; the slaying of Abel by Cain ; the building of the Tower of Babel ; the confusion of tongues and dispersion of the people ; the bondage in Egypt ; an Exodus from that bondage ; the passing of the Red Sea ; giving the law from Mount Sinai ;* sojourn in the wilderness ; the gaining possession of a holy or fruitful land ; building a temple in the city of Jerusalem ; the loss or destruction of that temple and city ; the captivity in Babylon ; the restoration from that captivity ; the re-building of the temple and city ; the advent of Jesus Christ, as a new incarnation of the Logos ; the persecution and crucifixion of that incarnation ; its death and burial, resurrection and asce nsion ; the apostolic preach- ing of the gospel for the institution of Christianity, and its effect on mankind ; the invasion of the Holy Land by infidels ; the combined efforts of Christia ns to expel them ; the varying success of that effort ; final triumph according to the pro- phecies. The present practised system of Masonry embodies all these subjects, without proper order and arrangement, and * A modern traveller through Egypt and the surrounding desert informs me that Mount Sinai is the theatre of one of the most powerful echoes known on the earth, and singularly adapted for any kind ot divine or priestly imposition upon an ignorant people. I do not reme mber that any other traveller has noticed this echo.

Neglects, mistakes, and want of written documents have thrown the whole into a medley. The dramatic arrangement of the contents of the Bible is a perf ect picture of the struggles and mishaps of human nature ; and the promised happy future is the conditional promise of purification by the aid of Christ, the Logos, or practical reason, in th e race. The mistaken use is to treat it as profane history, and not to receive it as a warning example in the statement of prin ciples. To the purpose of any theological instruction, it is no t necessary that the details be literally true as profane history. It partakes of the character of novel or other dramatic writing, of instruction as to character and principles by fiction, whic h to this day is received and most read as the most agreeable and satisfactory style of writ- ing. Our present public mind cares very little about simple, common-place practical truths. Human nature seems to crave mystery ; to be fond of riddles and the marvellous ; and, doubtless, it was ever so, and so provided for in the Bible and other mythological and dramatic books—so provided for in Masonry.

The candidate is raised from hi s knees, with the grip of a Past Master, and is entrusted with the grip, word, and sign. The grip is to grasp the broth er with the Master’s grip, and then extend the grip above the elbow with both hands. The word is Giblum, with some Chi bbelum. The first sign is to place the thumb of the right ha nd perpendicular on the lips, with the fingers clenched. In some lodges there is a second sign, which is to extend the right arm at length, in a right line with the thumb and finger appearing to hold the plumb- line. The obligated candidate is then placed in the chair, and the brethren salute the new Worshipful Master with the proper sign, and the late Worshi pful Master presents him with the various implements of the order, thus addressing him :— Worshipful Master, I now present you with the following implements or our profession, which are emblematical of our conduct in life. First .—The Holy Writings , those records of Masonic Light, will guide you to all truth ; you may learn from them how to form your own body into a te mple of happiness, learning to practise the whole duty of man.

In what manner were you placed to receive the obliga- tion ? A. Upon both my knees, my hands upon the Holy Bible, square, and compasses. Q. What was the reason of this peculiar position ? A. As my hands had been i nstrumental in duly executing the noblest parts of operative masonry, placing them on the Holy Bible, strongly figured to my mind that God’s word was to be the standard of every operation in my future life, that I might thereby arrive at the summit of masonry, by passing through the speculative degree of this mortal life to that glorious and celestial lodge, where the grand pass- word of the Almighty Architect will procure us admission, and with whom peace, order, and harmony will eternally reign.

Why were you initiated in this manner ? A.

The letter G in the centre was the proper passport, that be ing the initial of the pass- word of this degree, signifying a Mason that is master of his profession. Q.

Companions, the masonic system exhibits a stupendous and beautiful fabric, founded on universal wisdom, unfolding its gates to receive, without prejudice or discrimination, the wor- thy professors of every description of genuine religion or knowledge ; concentrating as it were into one body their just tenets, unincumbered with the disputable peculiarities of any sect or persuasion. This system originated in the earliest of ages, and among the wisest of men. But it is to be lamented, that to the desponding suggestions of some of the weaker minds among our own fraternity, the prejudices of the world against our invaluable institution are in a great measure imputable. Unable to comprehend the beauti ful allegories of ancient wis- dom, they ignorantly assert that the rites of masonry are futile ; its doctrines inefficient. To this assertion, indeed, they give, by their own misconduct, a semblance of truth, as we fail to discern that they are made wiser or better men by their admis- sion to our mysteries. Companions, I need not tell you, that nature alone can pro- vide us with the ground of wisdom ; but masonry will teach and enable us to cultivate the soil, and to foster and strengthen the plant in its growth. Therefore, to dispel the clouds of ig- norance, so inauspicious to th e noble purpose of our order "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 113 and to hold forth a moral whereby we may see the power and greatness of the all-wise Dis poser of events, the Royal Arch Degree gives us an ample field fo r discussion, by which we are shown, in the sad experience of the once-favourite people of God, a lesson how to conduct ourselves in every situation of our existence ; and that when fo rtune, affluence, sickness, or adversity attend us, we ought nev er to lose sight of the source from whence it came, always remembering that the power which gave is also a power to take away. Having in itself this grand moral which ought to be cultivated by every man among us—“to do unto others as we would wish to be done by:” and it is the ultimatum of all terres trial happiness, imitating in itself every virtue man can posse ss. May we, as companions, so study virtue, as to hand down to posterity a name unspotted by vice, and worthy of imitation. TO CLOSE A CHAPTER Z. ( Knocks to order, and says ): Companion Junior So- journer, the constant care of a Royal Arch Mason ? J. S. To prove the chapter tiled. Z. Let that duty be done. ( The J. S. gives the five knocks, which are answered from without by five from the Janitor .) J. S. ( With the penal sign .) Most Excellent, the chapter is close tiled. Z. ( Gives the five knocks, and says .): Companions, assist me co close this Royal Arch Chapter. The chiefs, sojourners, and companions form into threes, join hands and feet, give the word, as at opening, and pronounce as follows:— As we three did agree, In peace, love, and unity, The sacred word to keep ; So we three do agree, In peace, love, and unity, The sacred word to keep ; Until we three, Or three such as we, shall agree, This Royal Arch Chapter to open. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 114 Zerubbabel, Junior Sojourner, and Janitor, give the five knocks, and the Prince declares the chapter closed. Some chapters close in this short way:—The companions, scribes, and sojourners stand round the floor-cloth, exhibiting the penal sign. The three prin cipals form a triangle, each holding to the Bible. They sa lute the book, and pass it round for each person present to do the same. Then they form the grand triangle, and say:—We th ree do agree, this Royal Arch Chapter to close, and, in love and unity, the sacred word of a Royal Arch Mason to keep, and no t to reveal it to anyone in the world unless it be when three, such as we, do meet and agree, a Royal Arch Chapter to open. THE EXALTATION . The candidate for exaltation having been ballotted for and approved, is conducted by the Junior Scribe to the door. Four knocks are given by the Janitor. The Junior Sojourner, within, says: Most Excellent Zerub- babel, a report ( making the penal sign .) Z. See who wants admission. . J. S. ( Opening the door .) Who comes there ? Brother N——, who has duly and truly served his time as an Entered Apprentice, passed the degree of a Fellow-Craft, and has been, in due time, raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason, upon the five poi nts of fellowship, with the respective signs, words, and pass-words thereunto belonging ; and lastly, having been duly elected master of a lodge of Master Masons, installed in the chair and intrusted with the grip and word, the sign and salutation of a Past Master, now presents himself, properly prepared, for admission into this chapter, and for exaltation into the sublime degree of Royal Arch Masonry. J. S. Halt, while I make due report.—( He repeats the ap- plication to Zerubbabel .) Z. Companions, is it your wish that Brother N—— be admitted ? C. It is, most excellent. Z. Companion Junior Sojourner, is he in possession of re- quisite particulars, and properly prepared ? J. S. To the best of my knowledge, most excellent. "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 115 Z. Let the candidate be admitted in due form. ( The form is to pass the candidate under an arch made by the companions holding their rods so as to resemble a Gothic arch. He is placed in the west .) Brother N——, we understand that you seek preferment in our order; but, be fore you can be admitted, we must first ascertain whether you voluntarily offer yourself for the mysteries of this exalted degree ? Br. N. I do. Z. We must also further ascertain, whether you are pro- perly qualified to receive the mysteries of this exalted degree. The High Priest Jeshua advanc es, orders him to kneel, and thus prays :— Almighty God, who art the sole Architect of the Universe, at whose command the world burst forth from chaos, and all cre- ated matter had its birth, look do wn, we pray thee, at this time in a more peculiar manner, on th is thy servant, and henceforth crown him with every blessing from thine inexhaustible store. But, above all. give him grace to consider well his present un- dertaking, that he may neith er proceed therein lightly, nor recede from it dishonourably; but pursue it steadily, ever remembering the intention, which is the acquisition of true wis- dom and understanding, by searching out thy great and glorious works, for promoting thy honour and glory, for the benefit of the whole creation and his own eternal welfare. So mote it be. Brother N—— is then led to the altar, where the Prophet Haggai receives him, exhorts him on the solemn nature of his situation, and appraises him that he now stands before a repre- sentation of the Grand Sanhedrim, or famous court of Judica- ture among the ancient Jews. The High Priest here reads the second chapter of the book of Proverbs :— “My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my com- mandments with thee ; so that thou incline thine ear unto wis- dom, and apply thine heart to understanding ; yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and lift est up thy voice for understand- ing ; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures ; then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. For the Lord giveth wisdom, out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. He "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 116 layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous : he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his sa ints. Then shalt thou under- stand righteousness, and judgment, and equity ; yea, every good path. When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul, discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee ; to deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from th e man that speaketh froward things ; who leave the path of up rightness, to walk in the ways of darkness ; who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the fro- wardness of the wicked ; whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths : to deliv er thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words ; which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. None that go unto her return again, nei- ther take they hold of the paths of life. That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. For the upright shall dwell in the land and the perfect shall remain in it. But the wicked sh all be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.” OBLIGATION . Zerubabbel then administers the obligation. “I, A. B., of my own free will and accord, in the presence of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and this Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, do hereby and hereon most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, in addition to my former ob- ligations, that I will not reveal the secrets of this degree to any of an inferior degree, or to anyone except he be a true and lawful Companion Royal Arch Maso n, or within the body of a just and legally constituted chapter, under the penalty of having the crown of my skull stru ck off, in addition to all my former penalties. So help me Go d, and keep me firm in this my obligation of a Royal Arch Companion.” ( Kisses the Bible five times .) Z. In whom do you put your trust ? Br. N. In Jehovah. Zerubbabel makes the following exhortation :—In the name of that Omnipotent Being, arise, and may the remembrance of "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 117 the sprig of cassia, which was fo und on the grave of him, who was truly the most excellent of Masons, and who parted with his life, because he would not pa rt with his honour, ever sti- mulate his successors to imitate his glorious example ; that the essence of virtue may enshrine our moral laws, and like the beautiful rose of Sharon, in conjunction with the lily of the valley, exalt our intellectual part . When death, the grand le- veller of all human greatness, hath drawn his sable curtain round us, and when the last arrow of our mortal enemy hath been dispatched, and the bow of this mighty conqueror broken by the iron arm of time, when the angel of the Lord declares that time shall be no more, and when, by this victory, God hath subdued all things to himself, then shall we receive the reward of our virtue, by acquiring the possession of an immor- tal inheritance in those heavenly mansions veiled from mortal eye, where every secret of masonr y will be opened, never to be closed. Then shall the great Jehovah, the Grand Master of the whole Universe, bid us enter into his celestial lodge, where peace, order, and harmony shall eternally reign. ( The candi- date is directed to retire .) ————— CEREMONY OF PASSING THE VEILS. The following ceremony, called “Passing the Veils,” is dis- pensed with in some chapters ; but as it is an original part, it is introduced to make this work complete. The candidate is prepared with a blindfold, his knees are bared, and his feet slipshod, with a cable-tow round his waist. The three sojourners act as the guardians of the three veils. The Junior scribe is the conductor of the candidate, and gives four knocks at the door of the First Veil, which is opened, and the candidate admitted by givi ng the Past Master’s word, Giblum , and the sign. He is conducted round that part of the room, while the High Priest reads the third chapter of Exodus, verses 1 to 6 :— “Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian ; and he led th e flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 118 And the angel of the Lord appear ed unto him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of the bush ; and he looked, and, behold the bush burned with fire, an d the bush was not consumed. ( The bandage is taken from the ca ndidate’s eyes, and he sees a bush on fire .) And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,—Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. And he said, Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet ( the candidate here has his shoes slipped off ), for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God.” The High Priest Jeshua then reads the 13th and 14th verses of the same chapter :— “And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name ? what shall I say unto them ? And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM . And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.” The candidate is here informed that I AM THAT I AM is one of the words of the Royal Arch Degree, or the Pass-word from the First to the Second Veil. This constitutes the passing of the First Veil. The candi- date is then led to the Second Veil, and challenged by the Guard, who demands the Pass-Word , which is given by the candidate :—I AM THAT I AM . He enters the Second Veil, wherein is placed the figure of a Serpent and Aaron’s Rod. Jeshua reads the first five verses of the fourth chapter of the Book of Exodus :— “And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice ; for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto th ee. And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand ? And he said, A rod. And he said, Caste it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent ; and Mo ses fled from before it. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put fo rth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand and caught it, and it be "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 119 came a rod in his hand : that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, appeared unto thee.” The candidate is told to pick up the rod cast down before him ; that the act is the sign of the Second Veil, and that the Pass-words are Moses , Aaron , and Eleazer . With these words he passes the Guard of the Third Veil. Jeshua reads from the 6th to the 9th verses of the fourth chapter of Exodus :— “And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom ; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom agai n ; and plucked it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. And it shall come to pass, if th ey will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the wat er of the river, and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.” The candidate is told that the signs of the leprous hand and the pouring out of the water a re the signs of the Third Veil, and that H OLINESS TO THE L ORD are the pass-words to the Sanctum Sanctorum. He is sh own the ark of the covenant, containing the tables of stone, the pot of manna, also the table of shew-bread, the burning ince nse, and the candlestick with seven branches. After which, he is withdrawn to enter as a Sojourner. RE - ENTRY OF THE CANDIDATE . ( The five knocks are given at the door .) J. S. Who comes there ? N. Three Sojourners from Baby lon, who wish to offer their services to the Sanhedrim sitting in council, to assist in the re- building of the Temple. J. S. Wait, while I report to the Most Excellent Principals. Most Excellent,—Three Sojourners crave admission to offer their services for the rebuilding of the Temple. Z. Let them be admitted. ( They are accordingly admitted .) Sojourners, what is your request ? "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 120 S. First, we beg leave, Most Excellent, to sojourn among you ; and having heard that yo u are about to rebuild the Tem- ple of the Lord, we beg your acceptance of our best service in promoting that glorious work. Z. We greatly commend your conduct, and should be glad to know who you are. S. We are of your own kindred and people, sprung from your tribes and branches, and fr om the same original stock, equally with you, descendants of our forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But we have been under the displeasure of Almighty God, through the offences committed by our an- cestors, who deviated from the true Masonic principles and laws, and not only committed numberless errors, but ran into every kind of wickedness ; so that the Almighty, being dis- pleased, gave his judgment ag ainst them, by the mouth of Jeremiah and other prophets, by whom he declared, that the fruitfulness of the Lord should be spoiled—their city become desolate and an abomination, and that they should feel the weight of his wrath for seventy years. This actually began to be fulfilled in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakin—A. L. 3398. Z. Our knowledge of the fact s, and the candour with which you have related them, leave no doubt of your sincerity ; but we beg to be informed who were your immediate an- cestors. S. We are not of the lineage of that race of traitors, who fell away during the siege and went over to the enemy, when liberty and kindred had most need of their assistance : nor of the lower class of the people lef t behind by Nebuzaradan, the chief of Nebuchadnezzar’s offic ers, to cultivate the vineyards and for other servile purposes ; but the offspring of those princes and nobles carried into captivity with Zedekiah. The seventy years of captivity being expired, and the anger of the Lord appeased, he hath stirred up the heart of Cyrus King of Persia and Babylon, who hath issued his proclamation, say- ing—“Who is there of the Lord’s people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judea, and build him a house to the Lord God of Israel ; for he is the only true and living God.” We, therefore, have taken the advantage of this proclamation, and have returned for that purpose. "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 121 Z. Sojourners, how have you been employed during your captivity in Babylon ? S. In Masonry, Most Excellent. Z. What do you mean by Masonry ? S. That grand and universal science which includes all others ; but more especially th at which teaches the knowledge of ourselves, and the duties incumbent on us as men and Masons. Z. In what labour do you wish to engage ? S. We deem the lowest situation in the Lord’s house an honour ; therefore, we only beg employ. Z. Your humility bespeaks your merit, and we doubt not but you are qualified for some superior office. Those being full, you will be furnished with tools for the purpose, and we, for the present, shall appoint you to go and prepare for the foundation of the Second Temple. But let me lay this injunc- tion upon you—that should you meet with anything belonging to the First Temple, you will co mmunicate no part thereof to anyone, until you have faithfully made your report to the Sanhedrim here sitting in chapt er. Go, and may the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, be with you and prosper you. The sojourners retire, and are furnished with a pickaxe, shovel, and crow-bar, of the ordi nary size, generally made of wood, and kept for that purpose. After a short time, they re- turn, give the knocks, and enter as before. During their ab- sence, they are supposed to have been at work, and to have made a discovery, of which they come to make a report. After being duly reported and admitted, they are thus ad- dressed :— Z. Sojourners, we are informed that you have made a dis- covery. S. We have, Most Excellent ; for being at our work early this morning, our companion br oke up the ground with his pickaxe ; and we judging from the sound thereof that it was hollow, called upon our compan ion with his shovel to clear away the loose earth, and discov ered the perfect crown of an arch. With my crow-bar I removed the key-stone. Our curiosity was excited to know what it contained ; but being afraid of danger, we cast lots wh o should first go down, which lot, Most Excellent, fell upon me. We also agreed upon proper security against danger. I was then let down with a cable tied "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 122 round my waist, and another at each hand. Having arrived at the bottom without impediment, I gave the signal for my free- dom, and in searching the arch, found this scroll. From the want of light, I could not discern its contents ; for the sun had but just come to the portico of the eastern door, and darting its beams parallel to the plane of the horizon, I could not discover what it contained. I, therefore, gave the agreed signal, and was drawn up. We have, as in duty bound, thus come to make our report. Z. The discovery you have made is of the greatest import- ance. It is no less than the long -lost book of the holy law. You now see that the world is indebted to Masonry for the pre- servation of this sacred volume . Had it not been for the Ma- sonic wisdom and precaution of our Grand Master, this the only remaining copy of the law, would have been lost at the destruction of the Temple. We cannot too much praise you for your fidelity and promptness in this discovery and report ; and you will now return and make further search, observing, as before, the same precaution. ( The Sojourners retire ; after a while return, and are admitted as before, to report further discoveries, as follows :— ) Z. Sojourners, we are informed that you have made another discovery. S. We have, Most Excellent ; for, on recommencing our labour, we found a second crown of an arch, and with difficulty removed the key-stone. On descending the arch, nothing of consequence was found ; but judging from the sound thereof that it was hollow beneath, our curiosity was excited for a fur- ther search. We discovered a key-stone of a third arch ; on removing it, the sun, having now gained its meridian height, darted its rays to the centre. It shone resplendent on a white marble pedestal, whereon was a plate of gold. On this plate was engraved a triple triangle, and within the triangles some characters which are beyond our comprehension ; therefore, we have, as in duty bound, br ought it, and made our second report. Z. Pray, Sojourners, give us that which you have found, and explain the characters. S. That, Most Excellent, we should be glad to do; but must confess our ignorance, like wise men. We should deem it too great a presumption in us to attempt it. "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 123 Z. Sojourners,—These three mysterious words, in a triangular form, is the long-lost sacred word of the Master Mason, and is too incomprehensible for individual expression ; but in reward for your industry and zeal, you will now be put in possession of a full explanation of this the Grand Omnific Royal Arch Word. ( This is communicated to the candidate in due form, for which, see page 111.) Z. In drawing forth the third key-stone, you have obtained the Grand Omnific word, the prayer being the first, and the obligation the emblem of the second key-stone, as moral simili- tudes of material things. I have now to make you acquainted with the following five original Royal Arch Signs :— The first is the penal Sign, whic h is given by circling the fore- head with the thumb and forefing er of the right hand, alluding to the penalty of the obligation ; and also in allusion to the Sojourner’s guarding his eyes fr om the intensity of the sun’s rays, when the perpendicular reflection shone so brilliantly on the gold plate, which was found on the pedestal at the with- drawing of the third key-stone of the secret arch, and which contained the Grand Omnific word; and further, in allusion to the fall of man. The second is the Reverential Sign, or Sign of Sorrow, which is given by laying the right ha nd on the forehead for support, and the left at the heart in a bowing humble attitude. It re- presents the attitude in which our first parents met Jehovah in the garden of Eden after their transgression. The third is the Penitential, or Supplicatory Sign, which is given with the hands raised in the attitude of prayer, and the knees slightly bent, in allusion to the expulsion of our first parents from the garden of Eden. The fourth is the Monitorial Si gn, or Sign of Suffering, which is given by placing the right ha nd on the heart, and supporting an inclination of the head with th e left, in allusion to the pain that arose from toil in having to till the land. The fifth is the Fiducial Sign, or the sign of Faith and Hope, which is given by raising the ha nds above the head, in allusion to the prospect of redemption from the fall. I have now to invest you with the badges of a Royal Arch Mason, the apron, sash, and jewel. They are badges of honour and of our order. The apron and sash are of mixed colours, purple radiated with crimson. The purple implies awe and "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 124 reverence, and the crimson in rays signifies justice tempered with mercy. The character on the apron is designated the Triple Tau, one of the most ancient of emblems ; and as Masonry is the science of sciences, so this emblem ma y be styled the emblem of all emblems, for it is the grand em blem of Royal Arch Masonry ; and its depth of meaning reaches to the creation of the world, and all that is therein. The jewel is a double triangle within a circle of gold. The intersecting triangles denote th e elements of fire and water. The sun in the centre with its diverging rays is an emblem of the Deity. The encircling ring is an emblem of eternity and infinity, whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere, denoting omnipresence and perfection. I have now to congratulate you on your exaltation. You will now take your station in the chapter, and when a lecture is delivered, the mysteries into which you have been initiated will be further explained. LECTURE. FIRST SECTION . Q.

By four knocks, the Past Master’s word and sign. Q. Why were your feet slip-shod ? A. In allusion to the condition of Moses, before the burn- ing bush in the wilderness, wh o was told to put his shoes from off his feet, for the place whereon he stood was holy ground. Q. Why were your knees bare ? A. That I might offer up my prayers to the Great Jehovah, in the most humble manner, to thank him for mercies received, crave pardon for past offences, and implore his aid and pro- tection in my future conduct. Q. Why was the cable-tow used ? A. In commemoration of a singular benefit derived from it by the sojourners, in preparing the foundation of the second Temple. Q. After entering the first veil, what happened to you ? A.

I was again desired to be attentive to a portion of scrip- ture. which was read to me (Exod us, chap. 4, verses 6 to 9), and taught the signs and pass-words to the sanctum sanctorum. Q. Can you give me those signs and pass-words ? A. I can. ( He gives the sign as at page 119, and the pass- words ), HOLINESS TO THE LORD. Q. To what else was your attention directed in the third veil ? A. I was shown the ark of th e covenant, containing the ta- bles of stone and golden pot of manna : also the table of shew bread, the burning incense, and the candlestick with seven branches. Q. Did those signs and pass-words gain you admission to the sanctum sanctorum ? A. They did. Q. How were you disposed of ? A. I was desired to withdraw , to prepare for further in- struction. THIRD SECTION . Q. On your next application how were you accosted ? A. The junior sojourner demanded who I was. Q. Your answer ? A. A sojourner from Babylon, who begs to offer his services in rebuilding the temple. Q. What was the reply ? A. I was desired to wait until reported to the principals sitting in Sanhedrim. Q.

That I was descended from their own kindred and people, sprung from their own tribes and branches, from the same original stock, equally with the descendants of your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Bu t that we had been under the displeasure of Almighty God, through the offences committed by our ancestors, who deviated from true Masonic principles and laws, and not only committed numberless errors, but ran into every kind of wickedness ; so that the Almighty, displeased, gave judgment against them, by the mouth of Jeremiah and other prophets, by whom he declared that the fruitfulness of the Lord should be spoiled, their city become desolate, and an abomination, and that they should feel his wrath for seventy years.

To which I replied that I was not of the lineage of that race of traitors, who fell away during the siege of that ci ty, and went over to the enemy, when liberty and kindred had most need of their assistance, nor of the lower class of peopl e left behind by Neburzaradan, the chief of Nebuchadnezzar’s officers, to cultivate the vine- yards, and for other servile purposes : but the offspring of those princes and nobles carried into captivity with Zedekiah. Q. Were you questioned on the occasion of your return ? A. I was ; and explained, that the seventy years of captivity having expired, and the anger of the Lord appeased, he hath stirred up Cyrus, King of Persia and Babylon, to issue his pro- clamation that those of the Lord’s people who were inclined, might go up to Jerusalem and reb uild the temple, for that he, Cyrus, had discovered the God of Israel to be the only true and living God.. Q. What further enquiry was made you ? A. I was asked how I had been employed in Babylon. I answered in Masonry : and to a qu estion as to what it meant, that it was the grand and universal science, that included all other sciences, but more especi ally the moral one, which "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 129 formed the knowledge of ourselves and the duties incumbent on us as men and Masons. Q. Were you asked in what labour you wished to engage ? A. I was, and stated that I deemed the lowest situation in the Lord’s house an honour, and therefore I only sought em- ploy. Q. How were you then disposed of? A. I was accepted with the in junction, that as all the supe- rior offices were filled, I should be furnished with tools to pre- pare the foundation of the second temple ; but that if I found anything belonging to the first temple, I was not to discover it to anyone, until I had faithf ully made a report to the San- hedrim in chapter. Q. Did you make any discovery ? A. I did. Being at work with my companions early in the morning, breaking up the ground with my pick-axe, and judg- ing from the sound thereof that it was hollow, I called upon one of them to remove the soil with his shovel, when I disco- vered the perfect crown of an arch . Finding that it had no en- trance, with my crow-bar I removed the key-stone. Our curiosity was excited to know wh at it contained; but afraid of danger, we drew lots whic h should descend. The lot fell upon me. I was let down with a cable-tow round my waist, which was held by my two companions, and to which I held with my hands. Having reached the bottom, I found a scroll ; but from the want of light I could not discern its contents, for the sun had but just come to the portico of the eastern door, and darted its beams paralle l to the plane of the horizon. Remembering the injunction of the Sanhedrim, I was drawn up by signal, and proceeded to make the report. Q. What did it prove to be ? A. The long-lost book of the law, for the preservation of which, Zerubbabel observed, we had been indebted to Ma- sonry ; for, if our Grand Mast ers had not used their Masonic wisdom and precaution in the co nstruction of this arch, this the only remaining copy of the la w, would have been lost at the destruction of the temple. Q. Was anything further said to you on that occasion ? A. I was praised for my fidelity and promptness in the dis- covery and report, and ordered to return and make further search, observing the same precaution. "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 130 Q. Was there any further discovery ? A. There was. On recommencing the search, we found a second arch, beneath the first. The key-stone was removed with great difficulty. Descending that arch, nothing was found in it ; but judging from the sound that it was hollow beneath, we made further search, and found th e key-stone of a third arch. In removing it, the sun having gained its meridian height, darted its rays to the centre. It shone resplendent on a white marble pedestal, whereon was a plate of gold. On this plate was engraved a triple triangle, and within the triangles some characters, of which we imme diately proceeded to make re- port. When we made the report, we were asked if we under- stood the characters on the gold plate, to which we replied in the negative. Q. Were you instructed as to what they meant ? A. We were. Zerubbabel info rmed us, that the mysterious characters, within the double triangle, were the long-lost word of the Master Mason, and too incomprehensible for individual expression ; but that, in reward for our industry and zeal, we should be put in possession of a full explanation of this, the Grand Omnific Word of a Royal Arch Mason. We were fur- ther told, that as the drawing of the third key-stone had ob- tained us the grand omnific word, it had been so obtained by the prayer, which was an emblem of drawing the first, and the obligation , which was an emblem of drawing the second key- stone, as similitudes of material things. Q. Were you then invested ? A. I was invested with the sash and apron of a Royal Arch Mason: and also intrusted with the various branches of their laws and mysteries. FOURTH SECTION . Q. What are you ? A. A citizen of the world, a brother to every worthy Mason, and a companion for those of our Royal Arch Degree. Q. Pray, sojourner, who are you ? A. Of your own kindred and people, sprung from the noble and illustrious race of ancest ors whose honours we hope to merit, by a steady pursuit of wisdom, truth, and justice. "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 131 Q. From whence came you ? A. From the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Jerusalem. Q. Who were present ? A. Zerubbabel the Prince of the people, Haggai the prophet, and Jeshua the High Priest. Q. What do the Principals of the Royal Arch Chapter re- present. A. Zerubbabel, Haggai, and Je shua, represent the three key- stones, by which we learn, that in drawing them forth, the dis- covery is complete; and by th e passing of the sojourner through each of these offices, the mystical knowledge of our Royal Arch Chapter is to be obtained. Q. What do the two scribes represent ? A. The two scribes, Ezra and Nehemiah, represent the two columns or pillars, that supporte d the entrance of the Arch ; and thereby, also, is signified, their duty of registering and entering on our records every act, law, or transaction, for the general good of the chapter. Q. What do the three sojourners represent ? A. The three sojourners represent the three stones, whereon the three Grand Masters kneel to offer up their prayers for the success of their work. And he reby we have a lesson, that in every thing we undertake, we ought to offer up our prayers to the Almighty for success. Q. Why do we, as Royal Arch Masons, sit in this form ? A. To represent the Holy Roya l Arch and hereby, we have a lesson to pursue unity and co ncord ; for as one stone drawn from an arch endangers the whole, so may the improper con- duct of one member endanger the whole chapter. Q. Why was the ceremony of drawing the three key-stones observed ? A. To teach us not to rely on our own reasoning and abi- lities for our conduct through life ; but to draw forth our rules or government from the law and the prophets, and also to commemorate the discovery of the Royal Arch. Q. What was this part of their discovery ? A. The pedestal of perfect white marble, worked in the form of a double cube. On the top a plate of gold containing the figure of a triple triangle. Within the figure are the mys- terious characters, which the Grand and Royal Chapter in- formed us were the grand omnific word itself. "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 132 Q. Were you intrusted with the grand word ? A. I was. They gave me the grand movement, taught me the sign, and intrusted me with the sacred word, which is too incomprehensible for an individual to express. Q. Was that word ever lost ? A. It was. Q. In what manner ? A. By the untimely death of our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, who was slain by a conspir acy of the craft, in order to extort it from him ; therefore, as the word was incomprehensi- ble without three Grand Masters being present, another word was substituted in its room, until the Grand Architect of the universe caused it to be discovered. Q. How was that discovery made ? A. By the three sojourners preparing for the foundation of the second temple, who made the report thereof to the Royal Arch Chapter. As the labou rers were clearing away the rub- bish, they Perceived the crown of an arch. At the time of the destruction of the temple, the roof and walls fell in, and re- mained full seventy years a heap of rubbish. The arch, being unknown to any but the three Grand Masters, was their secret and royal council room. It was made and remained proof against the destroying flames and fury of the enemy, until the discovery was made and its contents known. Q. At what time did that discovery happen ? A. The discovery was made in the first year of the reign of Cyrus, King of Persia and Baby lon, on the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivit y. The three sojourners dis- covered the pedestal perfect and entire, having withstood the fury of the flames and rage of war, being defended by HIM who hath declared that he would place his word there, never to pass away. Hence we may lear n the vanity of all human pursuits against the arm of Omnipotence. FIFTH SECTION . Q. Can you describe the grand pedesta11 A. It was on a chequered pavement, to represent the uncer- tainty of life and the instability of things terrestrial. It was of perfect white marble, cut into th e form of the altar of incense, being the only true double cube, and thereby, both in figure "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 133 and colour, the most perfect emblem of innocence and purity. On the base of the pedestal is the letter G, which signifies Gib- lum, a common name for all Ma sons who are masters of their business. Hereby, we have a lesson of humility and brotherly love : for there is no doubt, it was most highly finished, as the work of the great Hiram Abiff himself ; he would not assume the honour, but affix the common name, that every companion might be a sharer. On the fr ont were inscribed the names of the three most excellent grand mast ers. On the top was a plate of gold, in which was engraved a triple triangle, and within the figure the grand omnific word. Q. Can you explain the jewel ? A. On the bottom of the scroll is inscribed the motto: Nil nisi clavis deest,— nothing but the key is wanting ; which may be taken in its literal sense. Then , the circle is an emblem of eternity, with the motto : Talia si jungere possis, sit tibi scire satis,— if thou canst comprehend these things, thou knowest enough . The two intersecting triangles de note the elements of fire and water, with a motto, declaring th at the wearer is desirous of doing his duty, and filling up, with justice, that link in the chain of creation, wherein his great Creator had thought proper to place him. Within is another triangle, with the sun in its centre, its rays issuing forth at every point, an emblem of the Deity, represented by a circle, whose centre is everywhere and circumference no where, denoting his omnipresence and per- fection. It is also an emblem of geometry. And here we find the most perfect emblem of the science of agriculture : not a partial one, like the Basilidean , calculated for one particular climate or country : but universal, pointed out by a pair of compasses issuing from the centre of the sun, and suspending a globe denoting the earth, and thereby representing the influ- ence of that glorious luminary over both the animal and vege- table creation : admonishing us to be careful to perform every operation in its proper season, that we lose not the fruits of our labour. Under these, is the compound character, | or the Royal Arch Mason’s badge. Q. What explanation have you to give of this deeply mys- tical character ? A. It signifies, in its figura tive appearance as T. H., Tem- plum Hierosolyma, the Temple of Jerusalem, and is always used as the Royal Arch Mason's ba dge, by which the wearer "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 134 acknowledges himself a servan t of the true God, who had thereby established his worship, and to whose service that glo- rious temple was erected. It al so signifies Clavis ad Thesau- rum, a key to a treasure ; and Theca ubi res pretiosa depon- itur, a place where a precious thin g is concealed ; or Res ipsa pretiosa, the precious thing itself . Hence we have the greatest reason to believe, that what was there concealed was the sa- cred name itself. But these are all symbolical definitions of the symbol, which is to be simply solved into an emblem of science of the human mind , and is the most ancient symbol of that kind, the prototype of the cross, and the first object in every religion or human system of worship. This is the grand secret of Masonry, which passes by symbols, from superstition to science ; as ignorance dealing with ancient mysteries and symbols passed from science to superstition. Q. Explain the five grand original signs. A. The first parents of mankind, formed by the Grand Archi- tect of the Universe, in the utmost perfection, both of body and mind seated in a paradise of pleasure, bounteously supplied with means for the gratification of every appetite, and at full liberty for enjoyment, to the end of time itself, with only one prohibition by way of contract, whereon should depend their immortality, soon became disobedient, and thereby obnoxious to sin, misery, and death. To preserve us from which, and as a memento to guard us from th e like error, we adopted the penal sign . Scarcely had our first parents transgressed, conscious of their crime, and filled with shame and horror, they endeavoured to hide themselves from the presence of that Being, in whom be- fore had been their chief delight ; but hearing the summons of his awful voice, and unable to be ar the splendour of his appear- ance, in a humble bending postu re, they approached with awe and palpitation of heart, their ri ght hand at their forehead for support, and their left at their heart, as a shield against the radiant glory ; and hence arose the reverential sign , or sign of salute . It was now they heard pronounced the dreadful sentence, that the ground, for their sakes accursed, should no longer pour forth in such abundance ; but themselves be driven from that happy region, to some less friendly climate, there to cultivate the hungry soil, and so earn th eir daily food by sweat and la- "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 135 bour. Now banished from the pr esence of their God, and im- pelled by the wants and calls of nature to constant toil and care, they became more fully sensible of their crime, and with true contrition of heart, they, with clasped hands, implored forgive- ness ; and hence arose the penitential or supplicatory sign , or sign of sorrow . Now fervent prayer, the grand restorer of true peace of mind, and only balm to heal a woun ded conscience, first raised a gleam of hope, and encouraged th em to pursue their daily task with greater cheerfulness : but seized with weariness and pain, the sure effects of constant toil and labour, they were forced to lay their right hands to the region of the heart, and their left as a support to the side of their heads ; and thus arose the monitorial sign , or sign of admonition . Now their minds being more calm, their toil seemed less severe, and cheered by bright-eyed hope, with uplifted hands and hearts, they clearly saw redemption drawing on ; and hence arose the last sign, called the fiducial sign , or sign of faith, and hope . Q. Why do we use rods in the Chapter ? A. In Anno Lucis 2513, our most excellent grand master Moses, tending the flock of Jeth ro, his father-in-law, at the foot of Mount Sinai, was called by the Almighty, and com- manded to go down into Egypt, and deliver his brethren from their cruel bondage. Moses, then in banishment, greatly hesi- tated, saying, Who am I, that I should go ? The Lord, to en- courage him, promised to be with him. Moses, still doubting, begs of him a sign, to convince him of his power, and to con- firm his promise. The Lord as ked, what is in thine hand. Moses answered, A rod. The Lord said unto him, Cast it on the ground. This done, it imme diately became a serpent : and Moses fled from it. The Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the ta il ; and it became a rod. With this rod he smote the two rocks in the wilderness, from whence the waters gushed out. With this rod he divided the waters of the Red Sea, and made them to stand as two great heaps. With this rod he wrou ght his wonders in the land of Egypt ; and, therefore, to commemorate these singular events, and as emblems, we make that use of them in our Royal Arch Chapter. Q. What definition have you of the banner of the Chapter ? "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 136 A. The banners of the twelve tr ibes of Israel, which we have for many purposes, especially to commemorate the great won- ders which he wrought for the ch ildren of Israel during their travels in the wilderness, where they were first setup around their encampments, and about wh ich each tribe was to pitch its respective standards. The devices thereon were emble- matical of their posterity and after ages. END OF THE ROYAL ARCH DEGREE"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 137 MASONIC ORDERS OF CHIVALRY. ——— KNIGHTS TEMPLAR. The Ceremony of Installation in the Masonic Cross Degree of Knights Templar of Jerusalem, Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes, and of Malta . ——— HISTORICAL PRELUDE . Profane History gives us no account of these Knights ante- rior to the time of the Crusades ; but the Revelation of Sacred History and Ancient Mystery, su pposes them to have been orders in the degrees of the Temp le, as they now assume to be in Masonry. The title of Hosp italler is traceable only to a provision for pilgrims journeying to Jerusalem in Palestine ; while the distinction of Knights of Rhodes and of Malta was acquired in the crusade wars, by their Knights getting and de- fending the possession of those islands. They had two resi- dences in London : that which is now called St. John’s-square, and the Temple by the river. MODERN VARIETIES . In the Masonic Degree of Knig hts Templar, the names of the officers vary in different Encampments. The following are found amongst them :—Grand Master, Grand Prior, Grand Sub-Prior, Grand Captains firs t and second, Grand Orator, Grand Prelate, Grand Chancello r, Grand Chaplain, Grand Re- corder, Grand Drapers, Grand Preceptor, Grand Herald, Grand Equerries, Grand Almon er, Grand Councillor, Grand Admiral, Grand Treasurer, Grand Hospitaller, Grand Marshal or Grand Vice-Admiral, Grand Bailiff, Grand Commander, Grand Master of the Ceremonies, Equerries of the Outposts, and a Janitor or Tyler. Some encampments make the Order of Malta to be distinct from that of the Templar ; whi le others create a Knight at once as a Knight Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem, of Pa- lestine, of Rhodes, of Malta, an d Knight Templar of Jerusalem. "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 138 THE SIGNS OF THE ORDER . The Penal Signs are the Chin or Beard Sign, which is a right hand thumb and finger stroking the chin or beard ; and the Saw Sign drawing the thumb or finger across the forehead, as indicative of the penalty of having the skull sawn asunder. The Grand Sign is emblematic of the death of Jesus Christ on the Cross, with arms extended, head dropping on the right shoulder, and the right over the left foot. THE WORD is Emanuel . The Grand Word of all is Adonai . The Word Necum , which signifies revenge , is also used by the Knights Templar on the Continent, and sometimes in this country. THE GRIP is to grasp each ot her’s arms across, above the elbow, to represent a double triangle. There is no exact regularity or fixed form in these Degrees of Chivalry, as they are not rec ognised by the Grand Lodge of England. THE PASS-WORDS vary in encampments to the following extent: I am that I am , Jao-bul-on , Jerusalem , Calvary , Gol- gotha , Arimathea , Emanuel , Ehihu or Elihu . In the Maltese Order, Eli, Eli, Lama Sabacthani , are the grand words : and Gethsemane , Capharsoleum , or Caiphas and Melita , are with some the pass-words. THE MEDITERRANEAN PASS . There is a pass-word and grip called the Mediterranean Pass. These knights were in the habit of traversing the Mediterranean Sea. Such as had served a year against the Mahometans were entitled to the pass-word and grip, which enabled them to re- turn free from molestation by their brother knights. The word is A-montra, a corruption of the French verb Montrer , to shew, to shew a sign. The knights on one side hail, by a trumpet, those of the other with A-montra. It is answered by the token, which is to seize a man by the thigh, as if in the act to throw him. The real pass-word is Maher-shalal-hash-baz , also spoken through a trumpet. The banners of the encampment are two: the first, black, with a white maltese cross of ei ght points, which is called the number of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John; the second, "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 139 white, with a red cross, which is that of the Templar. The Grand Commander has his own family banner. A candidate for installation is habited as a pilgrim, with sandals, mantle, staff, and cross, scrip and wallet, a belt or cord round his waist, with bread and water, and, in some encamp- ments, a burthen on the back, wh ich is made to fall off at a view of the cross. The whole ceremony is purely Christian, according to the vulgar notions and the literal sense of Chris- tianity. In the following ceremony the officers are a Grand Com- mander, First and Second Capt ain, Past Grand Commander, Grand Prelate, Grand Herald, Master of the Ceremonies, Grand Registrar, and Grand Orat or, Equerries of Outposts, and Janitor. CEREMONY OR FORM OF OPENING AN ENCAMPMENT . G. C. Does it meet with your approbation, sir knights, to open this grand Christian encampment ? Answer (all). It does. G. C. Sir knights, assist me to resume the duties of this grand Christian encampment. To order, as Knights Templar. ( All draw their swords, and rest the points on the left hand .) Sir Knight First Captain, what is the first duty of Knights Templar met together in arms ? F. C. To see the grand Christian encampment well guarded both within and without, and the sentinels well posted. G. C. Sir Knight First Captain, are the guards and senti- nels well posted on their respective duties, and this grand Christian encampment secure ? F. C. I will issue your commands to that effect. ( First to the Second Captain )—See that the guards and sentinels be well posted on their respective duties, and that this grand Christian encampment be secure. S. C. Trumpeter, sound the alarm. ( This being done and answered by the sentinels, the Seco nd Captain reports to the First ) —The guards and sentinels are properly posted on their re- spective duties, and all is well. F. C. Grand Commander, the guards and sentinels are pro- perly posted on their respective duties, and all is secure. G. C. What is it ? "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 140 F. C. Faith in Jesus Christ, peace and good-will towards men. G. C. Where is the Second Captain’s place in this grand Christian encampment ? F. C. In the north-west. G. C. ( To the Second Captain .) Your Christian duty when there placed ? S. C. As Christ arose at hi gh meridian and ascended into heaven to bring glad tidings to the believing world ; so it is my duty to preside in the north-west, to call the sir knights from the field to refreshment, that the Grand Commander may have the pleasure, and th e sir knights the profit con- sequent. G. C. You have a second duty. S. C. To receive, obey, and di sperse all general orders from the Grand Commander and the First Captain, and to see them duly executed. Also, to guard the entrance of the grand Christian encampment, that none pass therein, but those who are duly qualified. G. C. Where is the situation of the First Captain in this grand Christian encampment ? S. C. In the south-west. G. C. ( To the First Captain .) Your Christian duty when there placed ? F. C. Joseph of Arimathea, being a just and devout man, went to Pilate to beg the body of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which being granted he wrapped it up in clean linen and laid it in a new sepulch re wherein never man was laid, and closed the entrance thereof, whic h closed the first day of man’s salvation. And the First Captain guards this sepulchre. G. C. You have a second duty. F. C. To receive and dispatch all general orders from the Grand Commander to the Second Captain, and to see them punctually obeyed. G. C. ( To the Past Grand Commander .) The Grand Com- mander’s place in this grand Christian encampment ? P. G. C. In the east. G. C. His Christian duty when there presiding ? P. G. C. Very early on the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to the sepulchre. And lo ! there had been a great earthquake, and an angel of "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 141 the Lord descended from heaven ; rolled back the stone which covered the entrance to the sepulchre, and sat thereon. Which opened to us life from death : for as by the first man Adam, came death : so by the second Adam, came life everlasting. So it is the Grand Commander’s place to preside in the east to superintend, govern, and re gulate the grand Christian en- campment, by projecting schemes and plans for its general welfare, and to see that all orders and distinctions are preserved and duly executed with every be coming warlike enterprise. To order the sound of the alarm—to call the sir knights from re- freshment to the field—to figh t the battles of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and, after the grand prelate has offered up his prayer, to ope n the grand Christian encamp- ment. The Grand Prelate prays thus :—O thou great Emmanuel and God of infinite goodness, look down upon this conclave with an eye of tender compassion, and incline our hearts to thy holy will, in all our actions, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. ( He then, reads the first six verses of the last chapter of the Gospel according to St. Mark. ) “And when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had brought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning the first day of th e week, they came unto the se- pulchre at the rising of the su n. And they said among them- selves who shall roll us away th e stone from the door of the sepulchre ? And when they l ooked, they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great. And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young ma n sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted. And he saith unto them, be not affrighted : Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him.” G. C. ( The knights in the posture of the grand sign .) As our blessed Saviour’s resurrection from the dead opened life and salvation unto men ; and as all those who sincerely believe on him may rest assured of eternal li fe through his name ; the life of grace with all its comforts here— the life of glory with all its unutterable blessedness hereafter, both being effectually ob- tained by the death and resurrecti on of Jesus Christ who hath opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers. So, in his "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 142 names of Christ our prophet, Christ our priest, Christ our king, I now open this grand Ch ristian encampment, for the dispatch of such business as may come regularly and duly before us. P. G. C. So mote it be. ( The swords of the G. C. and the two captains are then placed in the form of a triangle, on the floor, opposite to the G. C. All the other Knights sheath their swords .) N. B. In some encampments, the G. C. merely pronounces that it is his will and pleasure, that this grand Christian en- campment be open for the dispat ch of business. This is re- peated by the two captains and the Master of the Ceremonies. After which, the G. C. pronou nces it open in the name of Christ our prophet, Christ our priest, and Christ our King. CEREMONY OR FORM OF CLOSING AN ENCAMPMENT . G. C. Sir knights, assist me in the duties of closing this grand Christian encampment. To order, as Knights Templar. ( All draw their swords and rest th eir points on their left hands .) Sir Knight First Captain, what is the constant duty of Knights Templar when under arms ? F. C. To see the grand Christian encampment well guarded, both within and without, and the sentinels well posted. G. C. Sir Knight First Captain, are the guards and senti- nels well posted on their respective duties, and this grand Christian encampment secure ? F. C. I will issue your commands to that effect. ( First to the Second Captain .) See that the guards and senti- nels be well posted on their respect ive duties, and that this grand Christian encampment be secure. S. C. Trumpeter, sound the alarm.

Grand Commander, the Guards and sentinels are properly posted on their respective duties ; and all is secure. G. C. With what is it secured ? F. C. Faith in Jesus Christ, peace and good will to all men. "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 143 G. P. ( Praying .) May the blessing of our Heavenly Cap- tain descend upon us, and remai n with us now and ever more, Amen. ( Reads the last six verses of the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Mark .) “And now when the even was come, because it was the pre- paration, that is, the day befo re the sabbath, Joseph of Ara- mathæa, an honourable councillor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. And when he knew it of the centurion, he ga ve the body to Joseph. And he brought fine linen, and t ook him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Jesus beheld where he was laid.” P. G. C. So mote it be. ( The Knights in their grand sign, posture .) G. C. When our Saviour’s agony was at the summit, and he knew that all things were a ccomplished, having received the vinegar, he said, it is finished . He then bowed his head, gave up the ghost, surrendered that life, which otherwise could not have been taken from him, as a ransom for many, and freely resigned his soul into his father’ s hands. The work of redemp- tion completed—the full atonement made—all the types and prophecies fulfilled—the laws magnified by a perfect obedience unto death—the justice of God sa tisfied, and salvation to sin- ners secured. Thus was our grea t surety laid under the arrest of death, and consigned to the silent mansions of the grave, that he might make the clods of the valley sweet to us ; prepare our bed of dust, perfumed with his own glorious body, and comfort us in the reviving hope of follo wing him through the grave, the gate of death, into a joyful immortality. After our blessed Saviour’s example, may we, by fa ith, when time shall be no more, cheerfully commend our departing souls to our heavenly Father’s keeping, until the ha ppy resurrection morn, when fashioned like unto Christ’s glorious body, our sleeping ashes shall be reanimated that we ma y then be taken to dwell with him in his eternal kingdom, where all terrestrial things will close. So, in his names of Ch rist our prophet, Christ our "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 144 priest, and Christ our king, I now close this grand Christian encampment, until that time you are next summoned to at- tend by my orders from the Grand Registrar.

C. and G. C. ) The candidate is ordered to kneel on both knees for the benefit of a prayer, and the Grand Prelate prays thus :—O Emmanuel, our great heavenly captain, look do wn, we beseech thee, on this encampment of thy devoted servants, and impart thy holy Spirit to the candidate now before us, that he may become a good and faithful soldier in t hy service, and be worthy of thy acceptance and salvation. P. G. M. So mote it be. G. C. As we must have a furt her trial of your faith, you must perambulate the encampment seven times, in order to prepare yourself, by meditation, to take a solemn obligation. ( This is done .) G. C. You must now kneel on both knees, take the Gos- pels in your hand, and receive the obligation from our Grand Prelate. G. P. Pilgrim, you are kneeling at the altar for the purpose of taking a solemn obligation, appertaining to the degree of a Knight Templar. If you are wi lling to proceed, repeat your Christian and surname, and say after me :— OBLIGATION. I, A. B., in the name of the Blessed Trinity, and in com- memoration of St. John of Jerusa lem, that first faithful soldier and martyr of Jesus Christ, do most solemnly promise and swear that I will never illegally reveal the secrets of a Knight Templar to a Royal Arch Mason, nor to any person beneath the dignity of this noble order, no r aid in the Installation of a "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 147 Knight Templar, unless five are present, under the penalty of all my former obligations. ( The pilgrim’s staff and cross are taken away, and a sword placed in his hand by the Grand Commander, who says )—In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I arm you with this sword, which you will employ in the defence of the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, against all opposers. I do furthermore swear, that with this, the sword of my faith, I will guard and defend the sepulchre of our Lord Jesus Christ, against all Jews, Turks, infidels , heathens, or other opposers of the Gospel. I do furthermore swear, that I will never knowingly draw the blood of a brother Knight Templar, nor cause it to be drawn in wrath ; but will espouse his cause, knowing it to be just, though I should endanger my own life. Even when princes are en- gaged in war, I will not forget th e duty which I owe to him as a brother. If ever I wilfully vi olate this my solemn compact, as a brother Knight Templar, may my skull be sawn asunder with a rough saw, my brains take n out and put in a charger to be consumed by the scorching su n, and my skull in another charger, in commemoration of St. John of Jerusalem, that first faithful soldier and martyr of our Lord and Saviour. If ever I wilfully deviate from this my so lemn obligation, may my light be put out from among men, as th at of Judas Iscariot was for betraying his Lord and Master. ( Here the sword is taken from the candidate, and a skull placed in his hand .) Furthermore, may the soul that once inhabited this skull, as the representative of John the Baptist, appear against me in the day of judgment, so help me God, our Lord Jesus Christ, and keep me steadfast in this my solemn obligation of a Knight Templar, and of St. John of Jerusalem. ( The Grand Prelate then directs the candidate to kiss the Gospels seven times, to rise, to deposit the skull on the triangular table, resume the staff, and thus addresses him:— ). Pilgrim, thou hast craved ad mission to pass through our so- lemn ceremonies, and enter the asylum of our encampment ; by the sandals, staff, and scrip I judge thee to be a child of humility : charity and hospitality are the grand characteristics of this most Christian order. In the character of Knights "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 148 Templar, we are bound to give alms to the poor and weary pilgrims travelling from afar, to succour the needy, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and bind up the wounds of the afflicted. As you are desirous of enlisting in this noble and glorious warfare, lay aside the staff and take up the sword, fighting manfully thy way, and with va lour running thy course : and may the Almighty, who is a strong tower and defence to all those who put their trust in him, be thy support and thy salvation. I now place in your hand a li ghted taper, and admonish you to perambulate the encampment five times in solemn meditation ; and if you have any prejudice or enmity with any Christian man, as a qualification for further honours, it is necessary you should forgive, otherwise fly to the desert ; and rather than appear unworthily among us, shun the knights of this order. ( At the end of this perambulation, the candidate stops before a cross, when his wallet or burthen is made to fall from his back. He is then divested of the pilgrim’s dress, con- ducted to the Grand Commander, and required to kneel. The Grand Commander lays his sword on the candidate’s right and left shoulder and on the head, and says —I hereby install you a Masonic Knight Hospitaller of St . John of Jerusalem, Pales- tine, Rhodes, and Malta, and also a Knight Templar. The Grand Commander then takes the candidate by the hand, and says —Rise, Sir Knight A. B.; receive a hearty welcome into the Christian Order, which will be ever ready to defend and protect you.) G. C. I now invest you with th e paraphernalia of the order. First, I clothe you with a mantle. Receive it as the Lord’s yoke ; for it is easy and light, and will bring rest to your soul. As a habit, it is of little worth, and we promise you nothing but bread and water. Secondly, I invest you with apron, sash, and jewel. The emblems within the triangle, the star on the sash and the Maltese cross jewel, you will have explained in the lecture. Lastly, I present you with a shield and sword, which, in the hand of a valiant and Christian Knight, is endowed with three most excellent qualities. Its hilt with justice ; its blade with fortitude ; its point with mercy ; which gives this important lesson, that having faith in the justice of our cause we must "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 149 press forward with undaunted fo rtitude, ever remembering to extend the point of mercy to a fallen foe. I shall now make you acquainted with the signs, words, and tokens, and our Grand Herald will then proclaim your instal- lation. First, the Mediterranean pass-word and sign. The hailing word is A-montra . The pass-word is Mahershalalhashbaz . The sign is to seize a man by th e thigh, as if in the act of throwing him overboard. The Knights Templar signs and words are, first the penal sign, which is to draw the fo re-finger or the thumb across the forehead, indicative of the pena lty of having the skull sawn asunder. The grand sign is to represent Jesus Christ on the cross, arms extended, head drooping on the right shoulder, right foot laid over the left. The word is Emanuel . The grand word of all is Adonai . Necum is also used by some Knights Tem- plar, particularly on the continent. The token or grip, is to grasp each other’s arms across above the elbow, to represent the double triangle. The motto of a Knight Templar is, In hoc signo vinces . Our worthy companion, the Grand Herald, will now pro- claim your installation. G. H. In the name of the Holy Trinity, and by order of the Grand Commander : hear ye, Sir Kn ights, that I proclaim Sir Knight A. B. to be duly installed Knight Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes, and Malta, and a Knight Templar. ( To be thrice proclaimed .) In some encampments, the followi ng is a concluding part of the ceremony :— One of the equerries, dressed as a cook, with a white night cap and apron, and a large kitchen knife in his hand, suddenly makes his entrance, and kneeling on one knee before the new Sir Knight, says : Sir Knight, I admonish you to be just, honourable, and faithful to the Order, and not to disgrace your- self, or I, the cook, will hack your spurs from off your heels with my kitchen knife. He then retires. At the conclusion of the ceremony of installation, it is usual for bread or biscuit to be hand ed round to the Sir Knight. A cup of wine is presented to the Grand Commander, called the cup of brotherly love. He drin ks, and desires the Sir Knights to pledge him in that cup of br otherly love, in commemoration "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 150 of the last supper of out grand heavenly Captain, with his twelve Disciples, whom He commanded thus to remember Him. ( The cup is passed round .) The Grand Orator usually delivers the following charge :— CHARGE . G. O. Sir Knight Companion, as you have passed the first degrees of Masonry, and have been balloted for, admitted and dubbed a Knight Companion of our most Christian and sublime Order, you are to mark and learn all those parts of our rules and mysteries which you will find to be ingeniously calculated to form and qualify you to engage in services of great moment. We have been informed that yo u earnestly desired and sought to be admitted, initiated, and united to our Christian order ; and that from free and disinterested motives, abstracted from pecuniary or secular views ; so we kindly entreat you to receive the instructions which we do now or may hereafter inculcate and enjoin. However strange and difficult our ceremonies may at first appear, we trust that you will persevere with unre- mitting zeal, and expect that you will be modestly inquisitive and uniformly attentive, in order to acquire such pleasing instructions as will be most expedient to forward the great purposes of rational and social converse. From what has been suggested, it appears that the order of Knights Templar is universally acknowledged to be the most sublime and refined, the most Catholic and efficiently useful department of Freemasonry. Its votaries are formed into a select body, self-existing and self-dependant only, being under no subordination whatever, the great and immutable scheme of Christian morality excepted. As we are orderly assembled fo r the most valuable of all pur- poses, so we are likewise enligh tened in a peculiar manner and strongly connected in the bonds of brotherly love, governed by certain and allowed rules, supported by decency, guarded by secrecy, skilled in mystery, both delightful and instructive, possessing the affection of each other, and seriously devoting ourselves thereto at stated time s and seasons, apart from all temporal concerns ; conversing together without dissimulation or reserve, and abounding in mirth, affability and good humour. We conceive you to be well informed in the three great quali- "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 151 fications which are essential to form the character of a grand Mason—morality, secrecy, and brotherly love, and shall not therefore rehearse them here. We expect that you will join with us in all things, in labour and refreshment, in silence and mirth, always rejoicing with us in prosperity, and sympathizing with us in adversity, and to be, like the rest of your brethren, obedient to the Grand Com- mander, or his Deputy, respectfu lly attentive to all the pre- siding officers, decent and dili gent while in the encampment, and always ready either to give or receive instruction. You are on no account to disobe y the summons of your Encamp- ment ; but, if your time will possibly allow, be punctual to the hour appointed. To all these pr omises, we expect that you will cheerfully comply, and we sincerely wish you much success in the issue of your labours. As an earnest of your desire to fulfil the respective duties which you have just heard proposed, you will be pleased to attend to the Grand Commander, who will question you on the great subject of Christian charit y, that great scheme of bro- therly love, which has been framed by the all-wise Providence, to procure for mankind, and mo re especially for Masons, the highest happiness. In the course of your answer, you shall have requisite assistance. G. C. Wherein doth Christian charity, or the love of which you have just now heard, consist ? Sir Knight. In doing all the good offices for, and shewing unfeigned kindness towards a broth er. If he be virtuous, it will make us esteem him. If he be honest, but weak in judg- ment, it will raise our compassion to commiserate and aid him. If he be wicked, it will incline us to give him pious admonition and timely exhortation, in order to reclaim him : and if he reform, it will augment our happiness. But if through per- verseness and self-will, he continues in an idle course and evil habit, it will excite our pity to pray for him, and if possible to administer to his necessities. It will at all times throw a veil over the reproach he may deservedly incur ; but if his character shall at any time suffer violence without a just cause, I will then exert my best abilities to wipe off every unjust aspersion by openly vindicating his character in a fair and honourable way. If from birth, honour, state, or wealth, he is my superior, it will teach me to be attentive, tractable, "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 152 obliging, and modestly submissive. If he be my inferior, it will make me affable, courteous an d kind. If he be my equal, it will teach me to preserve equity and candour towards him, in a social way. Lastly, if I receive good from him, it will make me thankful and desirous to requite it. If I receive evil at his hands, it will make me sl ow to anger, easy to be en- treated, and of long forbearanc e, when impelled to exact res- titution. In this last act of infliction, mercy shall always triumph over judgement, to my brother's edification and enlargement. G. C. I thank you, Sir Knight Companion, for the ready earnest which you have so cheerfully given of your intention to serve your brethren, with respect to your abilities and their several necessities and conditions in life. The Grand Registrar will now read the rules of our Grand Christian Encampment, in order that the Knights Co mpanions may be more fully in- formed of their whole duty, and become better prepared to acquit themselves agreeably to the honourable and friendly confession, which our worthy companion and the rest of the Knights have already made. G. R. Sir Knight Companion, the Grand Commander has signified his pleasure to me, that the rules be now read, which have been subscribed by all the Sir Knights Companions of this Grand Christian Encampment . Hear ye, hear ye, each and all, Sir Knights Companions present, the whole of the rules of your Grand Christian Encampment, as they have been written for your own good peac e, order, and pleasure, and afterwards distinctly heard, assented to, and freely subscribed, not by another, but by and for yourselves. All answer, We will hear. G. R. And, whereas, the Sir Knights Companions of this most Christian Order and Encampment of High Knights Tem- plar have drawn up, approved, and agreed to the following rules, the better to prevent feuds, controversies, animosities, or debate, with a single eye to the glory of God, the honour of his Majesty, the welfare and prosperity of the kingdom, and the well-being and happiness of each other, all of which they profess most religiously to observe ; they are now to be declared and known "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 153 LAWS AND REGULATIONS, To be observed by the Knights Companions of the Conclave . ———— I.

How were you introduced ? A. In that condition I was led towards the entrance of the Grand Christian Encampment, by the Master of the Cere- monies, and a trumpet was sounded. Q. What followed ? A. I was challenged by an Equerry. Q. What was that challenge ? A. Who came there. Q. Your answer ? A.

I was asked from whence, and if came of my own free will, and what I was desirous of doing. Q. Your answer to these questions ? A. That I came of my own free will from the wilderness of Judæa, which I had traversed, e xposed to great danger until I was met by the worthy Knight who accompanied me, and who promised me protection and safe conduct to the holy city ; and that I was desirous to devote my life to the service of the poor and the sick, for the sake of Je sus Christ, and to pray for my own sins with those of the people. Q. Were you further examined ? A. I was asked what recommendation I brought with me. "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 156 Q. Your answer ? A. The sign and the word of a Royal Arch Mason. Q. Were they called for ? A. They were. Q. How were you further tried ? A. In being asked if I had worked at the Second Temple ; if I had received Christian Baptis m ; if I believed in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost ; if I believed that God the Son was made man to save us ; if I believed in the inspiring power of the Holy Ghost ; and if I was willing to protect the Christian faith at the expense of my life. To all which I answered in the affirmative. Q. What occurred next ? A. I was ordered to wait unti l a report had been made to the Grand Commander and the Sir Knights of the Encamp- ment. Q. How were you admitted ? A. A saw was placed to my forehead by the Second Cap- tain, after examining me over again on the same subjects pre- sented by the Equerry. I thus entered the Encampment, and found the Sir Knights under arms . I was subjected to the same examination by the First Captain and by the Grand Com- mander ; after which, I was ordered to kneel on both knees, and receive the benefit of a prayer from the Grand Prelate. Q. What was further said to you ? A. The Grand Commander said, we must have a further trial of your faith. You must perambulate the Encampment for meditation and further preparation. Q. What was done with you then ? A. I was conducted to the west, desired to kneel on both knees, with my face to the east , my hand on the gospels ; in which position I received the first part of my obligation. Q. Be pleased to repeat it. A. I, A. B., in the presence of the Holy Trinity, and in memory of St. John of Jerusalem, that first faithful soldier and Martyr in Christ Jesus, do most solemnly promise and swear, that I will never illegally reveal the secrets of a Knight Templar to a Royal Arch Mason, nor to any person beneath the dignity of this noble order ; nor aid in the installation of a Knight Templar unless five are present, myself included, under the penalty of all my former obligations. "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 157 Q. After you had received the fi rst part of your obligation. what was then done with you ? A. My staff was taken from me, and I was presented with a sword as a substitute, with my hand still on the Holy Gos- pels, and in this prostrate fo rm I was taught to repeat the second part of my obligation. Q. Be pleased to deliver it. A. I do furthermore swear, that, with this the sword of my faith, I will guard and defend the tomb and sepulchre of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Chri st, against all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heathens, and other opposers of the gospel. Q. After you had taken the second part of your obligation, what did the Grand Commander do with you ? Did he not address you on the presentation of the sword ? A. He said, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I arm you with this swor d, as a distinguishing mark of our approbation ; and I am persuaded that you will only employ it in the defence of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, against all those who may oppose the same. Q. Be pleased to conclude the obligation. A. I do furthermore swear, that I will never knowingly draw the blood of a Brother Knig ht Templar, nor cause it to be drawn in wrath ; but will espouse his cause, knowing it to be just, though I should endanger my own life. Even when princes are engaged in war, I wi ll not forget the duty which I owe him as a brother. If ever I wilfully violate this my solemn compact, as a Brother Kn ight Templar, may my skull be sawn asunder with a rough saw, my brains taken out and put in a charger to be consumed by the scorching sun, and my skull in another charger, in memory of St. John of Jeru- salem, that faithful soldier of our Lord and Saviour. If ever I wilfully deviate from this my solemn obligation, may my light be put out from among men, as that of Judas Iscariot was for betraying his Lord and Master ; furthermore, may the soul that once inhabited this skull, as the representative of St. John the Baptist, appear against me in the day of judg- ment : so help me God, and keep me stedfast in this my so- lemn obligation of a Knight Templar. Q. Was anything added ? A. I was ordered to kiss th e gospels seven times, and re- ceived the charge of the Grand Prelate, who exhorted me to "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 158 fight manfully and run my course with valour, trusting in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Q. What were you then desired to do ? A. I was then ordered to take a lighted taper in my hand, and to perambulate the encampment five times, in solemn meditation, with the admonition, that if I had either prejudice or enmity towards any man, I wa s to dismiss it as a necessary qualification for further honours ; and that, if I would not forgive my enemies, I had better fly to the desert, to shun the sight of the Knights of this order, than to appear so un- worthily among them. This I promised to do. Q. How were yon then disposed of 1 A. The veil was taken from the cross, at the sight of which my burthen fell from my back. Q. And then 1 A. I was divested of my pilgri m’s dress, desired to kneel, and to receive the order of Knighthood. Q. How was that done ? A. The Grand Commander laid his sword on both my shoulders and my head, and bade me rise a Masonic Knight Hospitaller of St. John of J erusalem, Palestine, Rhodes, and Malta, and also a Knight Temp lar : giving me a hearty wel- come into the Christian Order, that would be ever ready to defend and protect me. Q. What followed ? A. I was intrusted with the si gns, words and tokens, clothed with the mantle of the Order, at which I was told to receive the Lord’s yoke, for it was easy and light, and would bring rest to my soul, and that I was promised nothing but bread and water, with that habit of little worth. Q. What next ? A. I was invested with the apron, sash and jewel. Q. What was then explained to you ? A. The Encampment and its furniture. First, the three Equilateral Triangles representing the Trinity in unity, in the centre of which was placed the omnipotent and all seeing eye. Second, the figure of St. John of Jerusalem holding out the Cup of Salvation to all true be lievers. Third, the Cock which was a memento to Peter. Fourth , the Lamb.

Seventh, the Sword and Sceptre. Eighth, the Star which appeared at the birth of Jesus. Ninth, the Ladder with the Five steps. Tenth, the Saw. Eleventh, the Sepulchre and Gospels. And Twelfth, the Cup. Q. What was then explained ? A. The seven agonies of our Saviour. First, that which he experienced in the Garden of Gethsamene. Second, being seized as a thief or assassin. Third, his being scourged by the order of Pontius Pilate. Four th, the placing on his head a crown of thorns. Fifth, the mockery and derision of the Jews by putting on him a scarlet robe , and a reed in his hand as a sceptre. Sixth, nailing him to a cross ; and Seventh, the piercing of his side. Q. What was finally done ? A. My installation was thrice proclaimed by the Grand Herald, and I partook of bread and wine, in commemoration of the Lord’s Supper, with the whole of the Sir Knights in the Encampment drinking from the cup of brotherly love.

In this in troduction they shall find the climax of the philosophy which they hold in allegory, and of which, in their lodges, they have no understanding, beyond the reading and uttermg of the lette r or mystery. They are in precisely the same condition with the Jewish and Christian churches, resting on the letter ; blind, deaf, dumb, and dead to the spirit or science of the sacred scriptures. The great mistake of the two churches, Jewish and Christian has been to read the Old Testament and gospel as historical scripture of human action, limited to time and place. As such, it could have only been the word of man ; and not the word of God. The Bible is of higher mean ing, is not the word of man ; but is, in truth, the word of God. To write history, inspiration is not necessary ; the most commo n-place memory is sufficient ; so inspiration makes no part of history, has no communion with it, they cannot be mixed up to gether ; hence the Sacred Scrip- tures are inspired writings, and not history of human action. History of God, they may be styl ed, and this is what is meant by sacred history : and it is wo rthy of note, that the contempti- ble history of man was not begun before the time of Herodotus ; or five hundred years before the Christian era, while the Sacred Scriptures are not to be limite d to any time, though first sub- mitted to public and general notice, in a translation from the Hebrew into the Greek language, at Alexandria, in Egypt, about twenty-three centuries since. This refers mlore particularly to the Old Testament Scriptures ; bu t we can trace the first Greek version of the gospel to the same city, and nearly if not fully up to the same period, in the Th erapeutan churches ; while the tragedy of Prometheus, by Eschyl us, is an older Greek version of the same gospel, as handed do wn from Persia and Hindostan. With God, or the word of God, there is no beginning ; no origin in time or place ; no subject for the limits of human history. God is immutable. Immutability establishes eternity. God is eternal. Eternity is the antithesis of beginning, but not of creation. God, therefore, had no beginning, but is a creating power. Creation being a composition of elements, the ele- ments, and not the thing create d, are eternal. The power is immutable, the composition mutable. And it is a human error in the translation of divine la nguage, to say or suppose that God began at any time to act upon a new scheme or altered "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 162 plan with the human race. It is the letter, and not the spirit of the gospel that thus states the case. That letter is nothing more than a drama prepared for personification, the spirit is in the principle or power to be personified. The letter is but a new version of the thing in every succeeding language, from the Sanscrit to the Grecian. The spirit is eternal, beyond all language, and, as the word of Go d, is co-eternal with God. There are but two distinct states of the human mind ; the one founded as on the letter of the Sacred Scriptures, the other on the spirit ; the one a state of error and superstition, and the other a state of truth and science. In the same sense, and under the same distinction, there can be but two kinds of churches and Masonic Lodges ; the one founded on, or made op of, the letter, the error, the superstition ; the other founded on, or made up of, the spirit, the truth, the science. All ancient priesthoods of which we have any records, and all the ancient mysteries, were presented under the two-fold distinction of letter and spirit ; the letter an exoterical doctrine, a lie and superstition for the people without : the spirit and esoterical doctrine, the truth and science of the thing, for the priest- hood and initiated within. This was the game, until both the priesthood and Masonic Lodges lost their own secret, their word, their revelation. It is now all mystery, all letter, all error, all superstition ; no revelat ion, no spirit, no truth, no science. It has been, and cont inues to be, my endeavour to bring the church and Masonic Lodges back to a knowledge of the revelation, the spirit, the tr uth, and science of their sym- bolical allegories, to throw a little scientific and intellectual life into them, to make them respectable and respected by the people at large, to stay dissent, and to make society a Catholic or Masonic brotherhood. In furtherance of this ohject , I shall now present the Ma- sonic reader with a glossary of Bible names, or rather a trans- lation of such names, for they have not been translated into our English language, in any other way than as a table or glossary. They are left in ou r English versions of the Bible to appear as names of human beings, and are read by the letter readers as names of human bein gs. The same sort of read- ing may be applied to the sacred writings of the Hindoos, and to the names of their avatars, and the same mistake be made ; while we now know, that these avatars, though called succes- "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 163 sive incarnations of God in man, were in spirit and science, large astronomical periods of time, presenting various condi- tions of the earth’s surface, an d various physical and moral ef- fects on human nature. Such I take to be the meaning of the Sacred Scripture names from Adam to Jesus Christ ; it is physically an astronomical genealogy, morally a mental one. There was a translated table of names in the Bibles pub- fished in the reign of Elizabeth. The introduction tells me that the translation has been corruptly, purposely, and wick- edly withheld from the Bibles printed in the reign of Henry VIII, Edward VI, and Mary I, and I find it was suppressed in the new translation of the Bi ble ordered by James I. The old introduction is a curiosity worth transcribing ; and though the author (Hervey) does not appear to have known the whole subject, he leaves us to guess that he knew something about it. I will give the matter in his own language, as far as the intro- duction goes ; but I shall take some liberties with his trans- lations, and give more of the spirit of the thing than he has given. I cannot rest until I ha ve made myself a thorough master of the Hebrew language, if I can live long enough for that purpose, for I almost daily make discoveries of spiritual meanings in that language, which none of our priests or trans- lators have hitherto taught us.. “Whereas the wickedness of time, and the blindness of the former age hath been such, that a ll things altogether have been a.bused and corrupted, so that the very right names of divers of the holy men named in the Sc riptures have been forgotten, a.nd now seem strange unto us, and the names of infants, that should ever have some godly advertisement in them, and should be memorials and marks of the children of God received into his household, have been hereby also changed, and made the signs and badges of idolatry and heathenish impiety, we have set forth this table of the names that are most used in the Old Testament, with their interpretations, as the Hebrew impor- teth : partly to call back the go dly from that abuse, when they shall know the true names of th e godly fathers, and what they signify, that their children, now named after them, may have testimonies by their own names, that they are within this faithful family, that in all th eir doings had ever God before their eyes, and that they are bound by those their names to serve God from their infancy, and have occasion to praise him "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 164 for his works wrought in them an d their followers : but chiefly to restore the names to their inte grity, whereby many places of the Scriptures, and secret myst eries of the Holy Ghost, shall better be understood.” ——————————— A TABLE OF SOME OF THE NAMES OF THE SACRED SCRIPTURES, Translated from the Hebrew and th e Greek into the English Language . ———— Aaron .

The Masonic meaning of Building the Temple of Solomon. With the help of this Table, the Masonic Reader must bear in mind, that God as the Father, is all the outer world to man ; and that God, the Son, the Word, lost, sought or recovered, signifies various states of the human mind, and is altogether a possession of the human brain, as a spiritual being. The same is meant by Temple Building. The Perfect Mason finishes the Temple, and restores the Word in himself as a spirit ; and then God the Son, being a knowledge of God the Father, dwells within him. The Temple Destroyed is the Fall of Man. Such is the Word Lost. Calvary, on which the Word is crucified, signifies the uncultivated animal head of man. Zion, the Holy Hill, where God dwells, is the high. intellectual, and cultivated head of man, the Temple to be built by Science—Masonic Science. RICHARD CARLILE.

The Catechism will be all that is necessary to explain the distinctions of the degree. The Masons call it a LECTURE ; but a lecture, in fact, is a discourse read, and not a catechism. CATECHISM . W ORSHIPFUL M ASTER . Brother Senior Warden, in what manner do we prepare our candidates in this degree ? S ENIOR W ARDEN . As a Fellow Craft, with the additionaI characteristic of this degree on his apron. W. M. What is that characteristic ? S. W. The ten mathematical characters, to correspond with the nine figures and cypher in arithmetic ; the signature of Hiram Abiff, and the mark of this degree. W. M. Why is he thus prepared ? S. W. To denote the official duties of this class of Masons at the building of King Solomon’s temple, and the discovery made by the brethren, when they were repairing the temple. W. M. Being thus prepared, in what manner did you enter ? S. W. By three reports (knocks), varying in sound from those of a Fellow Craft. W. M. Having gained your admission, how were you dealt with ? S. W. I was conducted round to repair the temple in a manner peculiar to this degree, and having made a valuable discovery, I afterwards received the solemn obligation to keep sacred the secrets of this Order. After I had taken the oblig- "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 191 tion and sealed it in the usua l manner, I was raised in the ancient form of.a Master Mason. W. M. Having thus bound yourse1f to keep sacred the se- crets of this Order, what were the mysteries with which you were then entrusted ? S. W. The sign, token, and word of a Mark Man. W. M. What does the sign denote ? S. W. The penalty of the obligation. W. M. Why was it introduced into this Order of Masonry ? S. W. To commemorate the signal used by our ancient bre- thren of this degree, when the first temple was erected in the city of Jerusalem.. W. M. What was that signal ? S. W. The trumpet. W. M. Why was it used ? S. W. To denote the approach of danger. W. M. What does the grip or token denote ? S. W. One of the penal laws of ancient Tyre united with the famous link of a Mark Man. W. M. What does the word denote ? S. W. Everything past, present, or to come. W. M. Why was this grand, majestic word introduced ? S. W. To hold in commemoration a. very remarkable cir- cumstance that occurred on the morning that the foundation- stone of the temple was laid. Whilst King Solomon was in the act of congratulating our Grand Superintendent, Hiram Abiff, on the occasion of his having discovered the celebrated problem in masonry and geometry, one of the precious stones fell from the royal crown to the ground, which, being per- ceived by the senior master of the Order of Mark Men, who, with the chief officers, were in attendance on this grand and solenm assembly, he picked it up and returned it to the king. This stone was of the carbuncle kind, and represented the tribe of Judah and our Saviour. It was formed into that great and glorious name, which King Solomon permitted to be used in the test word of th is degree, in commemoration of its having been found by one of the chief brethren of this Order. W. M. What was the origin al number of Mark Men at the building of King Solomon’s temple ? S. W. Two thousand. "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 192 W. M. Who were they ? S. W. The Senior and Junior Wardens of the Fellow Crafts Lodges. W. M. How many lodges of Mark Men'were there in the city of Jerusalem ? S. W. Twenty. W. M. Why limited to twenty ? S. W. In allusion to the he ight, length, and breadth of the sanctum sanctorum, or holy of holies. W. M. How many Masons in each lodge ? S. W. One hundred. W. M. What was the employ of these mark men ? S. W. To mark the materials, as they came out of the hands of the workmen, to enable them to put them together with greater facility and precision, when brought from the quarries of Tyre, the Forests of Lebano n and the clay ground of the Jordan, between the Succoth and Za rthan, to the holy city of Jerusalem. W. M. What were the peculiar marks on that occasion ? S. W. Certain. mathematical figures, consisting of squares, levels, and perpendiculars, that King Solomon commanded to be used on that occasion, whic h have ever since been denomi- nated the Freemasons’ Secret Alphabet or Mystic Characters . W. M. Can you describe those characters ? S. W. With that circumspection peculiar to Masons, I will meet you on the line parallel, by giving you one part, leaving you to your own free will in giving the remainder. W. M. I will thank you to proceed. The S. W. rises, salutes the W. M. with the sign, advances to him, and lays his two penal fingers* (first and second) on those of the W. M., and thus forms the index to the secret alphabet, by joining the horizonta l parallel to two perpendicular parallels. * A square, its portions, and the differ ent positions, into which those portions may be placed, with the aid of the dot, will form an alphabet of twenty-four letters, without the use of a quarter or single side, such as the Roman I. This is the secret alphabet of Masonry. It is very probable, that the circle, triangle, and square, their divisions, and the varied divisions of those divisions, first gave the idea of letters and an alphabet. The Egyptian letters are plainly of this character. One of the Greek letters is a triangle. The circle is common in almost all alphabets ; the square in many , the united divisions of both in all."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 193 W. M.

In what manner are th ey depicted in a Mark Man’s lodge ? S. W. On the under surface of the key-stone of King Solo- mon’s Arch, which they discovered to be a little loosened, at the time that they were inspec ting the subterraneous passages, and making preparations for the repairs of the temple. W. M. What else was there discovered ? S. W. Round the circle surrounding the letters H. A.

At the building of Ki ng Solomon’s temple, the valua- ble and curious key-stone, containing many valuable coins and the ten letters ill precious ston e work which Hiram Abiff took so much pains to complete, was lost, supposed to have been taken away by some of the wo rkmen, and a reward was offered by King Solomon for the speedy finding or making of another to fit the place. An ingenious Entered Apprentice made one "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 194 and fixed it in the vacancy in the arch, which, being known to some of the Fellow Crafts, they co nceived it a disgrace to their Order to let an inferior degree bear the palm of honour. They therefore, in the heat of jealousy , took it and threw it into the Brook Kedron, adjacent to the temple. A reward was also offered for the finding of this second stone, which excited the brother who had made it, to go , with two other Entered Ap- prentices, in pursuit of it ; and when they had found it, they received equally among them the last reward, and with it the degree of a Fellow Craft. The Brother who made it received the first reward to his own share for his ingenuity, and had the honour with his two Companio ns to fix it the second time in the arch, previous to which, the brother who made it cut on the under-side the word Amasaphus ; and in addition to his former rewards, he was honoured with the degree of Mark Man, which is done by going round the lodge of a mark man putting in his hands as a fellow cr aft to receive his wages. He is desired to state on what ground he claims those honours, and having informed them of his discoyery and what he had made, they then acknowledge his claim to be just; and he being desired to fetch the said key-stone, he finds it in his way to the arch, by kicking against th e ring of it concealed under ground, the original key-stone that Hiram Abiff had made, with the proper characters and signatures to it. He is then taught to put in his hands in due form for the payment of his wages, after which he receives the secrets of this degree. W. M. Brethren, I now crave your assistance in closing this lodge of mark men. THE BRETHREN STAND ROUND THE LODGE IN DUE FORM . W. M. Brother Senior Warden, what is the internal signal for closing this Order ? S. W. Three reports varying in Sound. W. M. By whom are they given ? S. W. By the Worshipful Master and Wardens. W. M. When are they to be given ? S. W. Immediately after all the brethren of this degree have given the proper sign. W. M. Brethren, be pleased to give me the sign. ( The reports are then given .) "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 195 W. M. Why are those reports given ? S. W. As a perpetual memorial of the labour of our ancient brethren in the three famous plac es where the materials of the temple were prepared :—the Qua rries of Tyre, the Forests of Lebanon, and the Clay Ground of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarthan. W. M. To what do the reports further allude ? S. W. To the class of workmen that compose this degree. W. M.

The opening of the lodge in this degree exhibits nothing different from that of the others, but in the distinctive sign, word, token, and knocking. LECTURE OR CATECHISM . W. M. Brother Senior Warden, you will describe the form of preparation that the ca ndidate has to undergo in this degree ? S. W. He is first prepared in the character of a Master Mason, with this additional characteristic on his apron—the H T is reversed, and in the ancient Masonic form . W. M. For what reason is he so prepared ? S. W. To point out the chief duties that this class of work- men had to perform when the materials were brought to them to be marked and passed in due form. W. M. In what manner did you enter the lodge after your preparation ? S. W. With five reports, and all of them distinct and loud. W. M. Why did you give this signal of your approach ? S. W.

In what manner were you proved as to the posses-. sion of those senses ? S. W. After traversing from west to east, I was commanded to kneel to hear and receive the benefit of the prayer ; and having been taught to repeat it from the delivery of the proper officer, my possession of this faculty was fully acknowledged. In the second round, the Holy Bible was presented to me, from which I was desited to read that passage where the word of a Master Mason is to be found. This ceremony proved the faculty. of seeing.. In the third round, the compasses were opened at an angle of ninety degrees, and applied fr om the gutteral to the pectoral part of my body, till my counte nance, on some particular emo- tion, denoted that I retained the noble faculty of feeling . In the fourth round, the pot of manna was presented to me, and having partaken of it s contents, and declared the same good, the proper officer acknowledged my possession of the faculty of tasting . I was then delivered over to the Senior Warden, who kindly conducted me round, for the last probation, to the Right Worshipful Master in the east, where, standing in due form behind the sacred altar, I was taught to kneel before the pot of incense : being commanded to pronounce its contents, I was acknowledged by the master to be in possession of all the five external senses, and was a ccordingly passed in due form to receive the further ceremony of this degree. W. M. What was the chief thing that entitled you to the sacred Mysteries of this Order ? S. W. My free acceptance of the great and solemn obliga- tion.

M. Having now by the most solemn ties of honour, fidelity, and brotherly love, bound yourself to the religious per- formance of your sacred test, what was your reward for that voluntary sacrifice ? S. W. The communications of its sacred mysteries. W. M. Name the three first. S. W. The sign, token, and word of a Mark Master. W. M. What does the sign denote ? S. W. The penalty of the obligation. W. M. Why was it introduced in this degree ? S. W. In commemoration of th e signal used by the ancient brethren of this Order, at the erection of that famous temple in the holy city of Jerusalem, by our most excellent grand master, Solomon, King of Israel. W. M. What was that signal ? S. W. The celebrated Light House on the highest part of Mount Lebanon. W. M. For what purpose was it there set up ? S. W. To guide and direct the ancient mariners employed in fetching gold, ivory, and precious stones, from Ophir, for the ornamental parts of the temple. W. M. What does the token denote ? S. W. Another of the penal laws of ancient Tyre united with the link of a Mark Master. W. M. What does the word denote ? S. W. Omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient. W. M. To what does it further allude ? S. W. To one of the names of the Almighty Creator of heaven and earth ; which name, wi th all its glorious attributes, King Solomon caused to be entirely displayed in the centre of his audience-chamber. It was th is grand ineffable name, with all its glorious attributes subjoined, and aided by the admira- ble eloquence and wisdom of Solomon, that wrought the con- version of his noble friend and ally the great and learned King of Tyre ; and which he, in conjunction with Solomon and our grand superintendent, Hiram Abiff, conferred on the brethren of this degree as one of their distinguishing characteristics . W. M. What was the original number of Mark Masters at the building of the first, glorious temple of Jerusalem ? S. W. One thousand. "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 198 W. M.

Why confined to twenty ? S. W. In allusion to the breadth of the holy place. W. M. How many masons in each lodge ? S. W. Fifty. W. M. What was the employ of these masons ? S. W. To re-examine the materials, after they were brought to Jerusalem, that every part might duly correspond, and pre- vent confusion and mistake, when they were employed in fitting the respective parts to their pr oper places; and by their ad- ditionaI marks, in the form of an equilateral triangle, they proved and fully passed the work previously examined by the Mark Men. W. M. What were the marks or characters used by the brethren of this degree ? [Here the brother, instead of a nswering in the usual manner, gives the division of the Tau, in the ancient and masonic cha- racter, formed by his hands thus ; and the right worship- ful Master answers him with his Hiram in a similar manner.] W.

Then, brethren, as master of that class, I declare this lodge duly closed, until our brethren have furnished us with fresh. materials for labour in our mystical science of free and accepted masonry. ——— A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARCHITECT’S DEGREE IN MASONRY. [Of the degrees of Architect and Grand Architect, I have two descriptions, as practised in different lodges, one by Finch. As far as possible, I have unit ed them ; where not possible, I exhibit both.]—E D . The lodge is hung with black, in remembrance of the loss sustained by the death of a form er architect, and is lighted with twenty-one lamps. A throne is elevated in the east ; a table is placed in the centre, on which are a Bible, a pair of com- "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 200 passes, a square, and a trowel in an urn. The contents of the latter is a mixture of milk, oil, flour, and wine, which is sup- posed to be the heart of a worthy brother. The drawing on the floor is an oblong. The emblem on it a triangle enclosing a flaming star ; in the centre the letter G. and below, the letters S. W. G. and G. H. S. The master represents Solo mon, and is called the Right Worshipful Overseer of Master Architects , in some lodges Most Mighty ; the wardens are called Senior and Junior Superintendents and most respectable , and the brethren Mastet Architects and most venerable . They wear a deep red sash, and their aprons are edged with the same colour. In opening the lodge, the master strikes seven, (Finch says six,) observing a distance betw een the third and fourth. The ceremonies of caution as to the close tiling of the lodge are then gone through, and the master asks,—What is the time ? A. The hour of a perfect Mason. Q. What is that hour ? A. The first instant of the first hour of the first day that the Grand Architect created the heavens and the earth. R. W. O. This is the first instant of the first hour of the first day, that I, as a master, open and hold this lodge. It is time to begin our labours. RECEPTION OF THE CANDIDATE FOR PASSING . The candidate, who has been divested of his sword and blind- folded, is led in and placed between the wardens or superin- tendents, and is thus addressed by the master. R. W. O. Brother ——, before we can admit you into this mysterious degree of Masonry, you must declare your abhor- rence of the crime of those wo rthless ruffians who caused the vacancy of an architect. As a te st of your integrity, we require you to partake of the heart of this innocent victim, for which purpose we have presented it in this urn. The R. W. O. takes the trowel, and giving on the point of it a small portion of the conten ts of the urn, thus addresses him :—“May this you now receive be the cement and bond of union between us. May it remain indissoluble. Say with us, — misfortune to him who would disunite us .” At this time the obligation is administered, the pena lty of which, in addition to all former penalties, is to be deprived of the rites of burial . "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 201 [On his rising from his knees, the candidate is thrown on his face, so that his mouth covers the blazing star on the floor, and the bandage is taken from his eyes.] Q. What do you see ? A. The flaming star and the letter G. Q. What does it signify ? A. Glory, grandeur, and geometry. [Candjdate rises, and is presented with an apron and sash.] R. W. O. Brother ——, I reward you with zeal for Masonry, by declaring you an architect. The difference which you ob- serve in this apron proves the su periority of this degree, as, in future, you will be employed only in the elevation of the temple. The sash with which I invest yo u is a mark of distinction over the inferior orders, and its colours are to remind you, that a former architect chose rather to shed his blood than to reveal our mysteries. After his death the works were at a stand, and Solomon was zealous to complete it; for this purpose, he convened those masters who had distinsrnished themselves by their genius, capacity, and manne rs, and formed them into a lodge to effect it. As those selected were no longer to be confounded with the multitude of the workmen, Solomon commanded that the dis- tinct mark that they had worn should be changed, and that they should in future have a right to enter the sanctum sanc- torum , having previously been placed upon the letter G and flaming star. By the original design of the edifice, Solomon perceived that the first elevation was perfect. He, therefore, ordered a second to be placed with the same proportions, under the direction of the Lodge of Architects. Under the desire of one of these, Solomon directed that, in succeeding ages, another should be alected to prevent this valuable part of masonry from being obliterated ; that this brother, before his admittance, should engage himself, by promises such as you have entered into— and may you many years associ ate and enjoy this happiness among us !

M ASTER . Most venerahle brethren, the second elevation of the temple is finished, and in conformity to the supreme or- ders, we are to erect a third, that will terminate the height of it, according to the original design. The superintendence of this third part must be commi tted to the care of an able, a diligent, and complete workman, such a one as we have not at present among the grand architects . We are now convened, and as we have not any particular business before us to engage our attention, the time cannot be better spent than in select- ing an addition to our lodge, who by his assiduity and expe- rience, may be worthy of the appointment to which I allude. ( An interruption here occurs, by a report, that brother Moa- bon, an architect, is in waiting, to be examined for a superior degree. ) The work has met with obstacles that have impeded its progress ; but it cannot with propriety be longer suspended. Our choice must be speedily made . It is fortunate for that architect, whose report you have just witnessed, that he has applied in time to be a candidat e : let him be, according to his request, examined, and with caution, for it is the work only of Grand Architects to erect structures in the air. The task is too great for inferior craftsmen. They only know by admir- ing them at a distance when do ne. Let us now put the finish- ing stroke to the Temple. If Moabon is qualified, may he suc- ceed, and ever after live with glory, happiness, and prosperity, and may his name exist to the end of time, as a mighty and respectable word among great architects. ( The brethren place their hands thrice upon, the drawing, which is the sign of assent for hi s examination; he is introduced and placed in the west, and thus addressed by the Master .) Worthy architect, the degree to which you aspire, is a point of elevation to which you are a stranger. The superior art re- quired to be displayed on this occasion, makes us apprehen- sive that your abilities are by no means equal to the task. The difficulties you have to encounter are great, and can only be surmounted by the extent of your knowledge and the ut- most exertions and limits of your skill. A perfect design for "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 207 the third structure of the temple is required from you, and as the necessity of raising it is urgent and will not admit of de- lay, you must return to us as soon as you have completed your design. The candidate is then led twenty-seven times round the room, and a drawing of the temple (usually on paste-board) with a third elevation, is put into his hands. He is stopped in the west, and acquaints the Master that he is prepared with a design, and presents it for their approbation. With three steps he is led to the tluone , to deliver it to the Master, who passes it round the lodge. While this is doing, the can- didate kneels, his right hand is on the Bible and his left on a sword, with a pair of compasses over the wrist. In this posi- tion he takes the obligation, which is, not to reveal the secrets of the degree to anyone who has not produced a design for the third elevation, under the penalty of expulsion from the order and the lodge. M ASTER . Rise, and let the veil of obscurity be removed, for Moabon is worthy of beholding our labours. ( At a signal the brethren salute him .) M ASTER . My brother, it is a satisfaction that we have been witnesses of your skill and abilit y, and of your endeavours to give satisfaction in the task pr escribed to you. The execution of your design impels us to admit you a Grand Architect. May this new favour conferred on you stimulate you to merit the illustrious degree which succeeds, and which derives its splendour from the circumstance, that it will fall to the lot of one of us to be recognised therein as a Grand Master. Ap- proach and receive the marks of rank to which you are enti- tled, and to which alone your perseverance has elevated you. To distinguish ourselves as grand architects, there is a sign, a grip, and a word. The sign is to place the two hands on the head, to form a triangle with th e thumb and fore finger of each hand. It is to be answered by the hands being in the same form above the head. The grip is to take one anot her by the right hand indis- criminately, and to turn them thrice alternately above and below each other. The word is your name Moabon , to be pronounced by syllables, in maki ng the turning of the hands. This sash and this jewel are indi cative of the degree of which you are now in possession, and it is the only mode of your "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 208 expressing yourself to be such out of the lodge. The sign, word, and grip are considered as sacred, and are not to be used elsewhere. If accident should o ccasion your visiting the lodges of the inferior degrees, and you are not provided with your sash and jewel, you are at libert y to tuck the left corner of your apron into the band, and by that you will be recognised a grand architect. You will no w pay your respects to the brethren, and afterwards attend to the CATECHISM . Q. Are you a grand Architect ? A. I am. Q. Where were you received ? A. In the middle chamber. Q. Why there ? A. The lodge was held there wh en the second elevation was finished. Q. Who gave the design of the temple ? A. The Grand Architect of the Universe. Q. To whom ? A. To Solomon. Q. By what means ? A. By inspiration. Q. In what manner were you employed in the middle chamber ? A. In designing a third elevation. Q. By what means were you admitted a Grand Architect ? A. By the perfection of the drawing which I presented to the Master. Q. What reward did you receive in return ? A. A sign and grip. Q. Deliver them to the next brother ( This is done ). What was the word pronounced ? A. The name of a great architect. Q. Declare it.. A. Mighty Master, I will give you one syllable, if you will give me another. Q. I am agreeable A. Mo. Q. A. A. Bon. "},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 209 Q. How old are you ? A. Twenty-seven years. Q. What remains to be performed ? A. To veil the Lodge of Grand Architects. The master strikes twenty-seven times and declares the lodge to be concluded. FINCH ’ S CATECHISM IN THIS DEGREE . Right Worshipful Ruler. Brother Senior Overseer, why do we open and close this degree with seven reports ? S. O. In allusion to the six days of the creation, and the institution of the seventh as a sabbath. R. W. R.

And the seventh representing the holy Sabbath is given by the R. W. R. with his Hiram on the holy writing. R. W. R. How is the candidate prepared in this degree ? S. O. With the inward plans of the Holy Temple of Jeru- salem. R. W. R. What reason do we assign for this ? S. O. To prove to the breth ren present, that he has been duly initiated into the degree of Architect, and then stands fully prepared to receive the promotion of Grand Architect of the Temple as the representative of our inspired grand superintendent, Hiram Abiff. R. W. R. In what manner did you make your entry into the lodge ? S. O. By three distinct and two quick reports. R. W. R. Why in this manner ? S. O. In allusion to the No. of this degree. R. W. R. Is there a second reason why wc give these reports ? S. O. That the squares of th e Nos. may be represented by us when we enter the lodge of the Grand Architects, which our Grand Master, King Solomon, in conjunction with his worthy colleague, the learned King of Tyre, commanded to be practised, for the better understanding of the basis of that "},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 210 valuable discovery made by our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, on the morning that the founda tion-stone of the Temple was laid by the hand of that wise and super-excellent King of the Jews. R. W. R. Why is the ceremony of traversing the lodge in this degree observed ? S. O. Because King Solomon, with the high priest and elders of the Israelites, went, in public procession round the Temple when the cape stone was laid and the building completed. R. W. R. To what does the sign of this degree allude ? S. O. To the second or inward elevation of the Temple. R. W. R. To what does the token allude ? S. O. To the number of lodges that compose the secret words of this degree. R. W. R. To what do the words allude ? S. O. To the dignity which King Solomon conferred on the brethren of this order. R. W. R.

Brethren, I will thank you to assist me in closing "},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 212 the lodge in this degree. What is the last duty, Brother Senior Overseer ? S. O. To see that wc are properly tiled externally. R. W. R. What is the next duty, Brother Senior Overseer ? S. O. To see that we are properly closed internally, to de- posit the Royal Standard in the pedestal, and to crave a blessing on the work. R. W. R. Then, brethren, I will crave your assistance to enable me to close our labours with peace, unity, and form ; therefore, brethren, I will thank you to advance, from the west to the pedestal in the east, and to assist each other in taking down the royal standard, to see it safely deposited, with the Holy Law and Jewels, in our ancient and sacred repository. The brethren now advance in due form, and when arrived under the banner, they pull ge ntly the plummet, suspended fronl the crown of the standard, which, being connected with a set of pullies mechanically arranged, they lower it a little by degrees, while the organ plays a. solemn march. The last brother that advances is the Se nior Overseer, who takes it down and puts it into the pedestal. He then returns, with the rest of the brethren, to their respective places, by the proper ad- vances, and stop in due form, wh en the R. W. R. and S. and J. O. close the lodge, by seven knocks, and the grand honours are given by all the brethren. ——o—— A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF SCOTCH MASTER OR SUPERINTENDENT. In this degree, the Master is called very powerful , and the brethren very honourable . The decorations of the apartments are splendid. The ensigns of the different orders in Masonry are designed in colours, and, at proper distances, receive the aid of eighty-one lights. On the drawing, the furniture or sacred utensils of the Temple of Solomon are delineated, the ark of alliance, the altar of incense, the golden candlestick, the table of shew-bread, the brazen altar, the brazen sea, &c. The jewel is worn pendant to a red sash, and the apron is bordered with red. A transparency of the temple is in the "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 213 east, and the lodge opens as in the preceding degree of Grand Architect. The candidate is prepared as before, with the exception of the blindfolding ; the necessity of the distinction will appear evident in the cause of THE RECEPTION OR PASSING . The candidate is admitted by the signal of a Grand Archi- tect. The Wardens place him between them, and thus ad- dresses the Master :—Very Powerful, Moabon is present, and ardently desires to participate in our labours. You gave him to understand, in the precedin g degree, that there was wanting yet a ceremony for him to undergo, before he would be in complete possession of the secrets of Masonry. His zeal has brought him into your presence to obtain them. V. P. Brother Moabon, we cannot sufficiently applaud your perseverance in endeavouri ng to explore our secret mys- teries. They are withheld fr om every one until we are well satisfied of the conduct of those who solicit them ; for our pru- dence will only permit us to grant them to those whom we have all tried. Your conceptions upon this business are most probably erroneous ; for it is scarcely possible for you to conjecture the object or inte nt of our meeting. The gran- deur of this degree is immense, and with the permission of the very honourable brethren wh o assist me, I will declare it. The mighty degree which we now bold is that of a Superinten- dent Scotch Master. The Temple is raised from the founda- tion to a cape-stone : the elevat ions are perfect, and the sacred utensils only remain to be prepared, after the drawing of the greatest Master that ever lived. We are to elect a successor, who will complete with honour and with glory the models which he designed. Move about the lodge, exercise your genius, and present to us the result. The candidate traverses eighty-o ne times round the drawing, and at length the Wardens give him designs for the fur- niture, which he presents to the Master. V. P. Moabon, the designs are worthy of the subject ; but there is an obligation to which you are to submit, before you can be inade acquainted with our secrets. This engagement differs from those which you have already taken, inasmuch as that they were entered into in darkness; whereas, this is offered to you without restraint. It is now for you to decide. "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 214 We have the power to release you from your professions, even of those which you have made with us. It is a matter of indif- ference, if you reveal all that yo u already know on the subject of Masonry. We care not if it becomes the amusement of the popular world. What is now requi red of you is, an act of sin- cerity, and, as such, it is tra nscribed for your perusal and ap- probation. If you do not concur with the contents, say so, and we will act accordingly. If you consent, read it with an audi- ble voice, and we will attend to you. OBLIGATION . Upon the possession of my sense s, upon the existence of my reason, and upon the understanding that supports, guides, and enlightens me, I promise, swear, and vow, that I will keep in- violate all the secrets, signs, an d mysteries which have been to the present time unveiled, or th at shall be revealed to me in future. If I am not faithful to this engagement, may my body be exposed to pains and penalt ies ; may the veins of my tem- ples be opened, and may I be exposed upon a pyramid to the heat of the sun, the cold of th e night, and the rigours of the winds ; may my blood run slowly, drop by drop, till the spirit is extinguished that animates the substance ; may I augment my sufferings, if I fail herein ; may nourishment be given to me daily, proportionate and sufficient only to preserve and prolong a miserable existence, as no punishment can suffi- ciently atone for my perjury. If the candidate refuses to repeat it, the Wardens point their swords to his back, and drive him before them twenty-seven times round the lodge, and then th rust him out of doors. This is called pumping. If he accepts, he pronounces the obligation in an audible voice, and the paper is committed to the flames. V. P. Brother Moabon, your zeal having engaged you to persevere with the firmness of a good Mason, we shall now proceed to your proclamation as a Superintendent Scotch Mas- ter, a ceremony which from time immemorial has always taken place in the eastern part of the temple. Prior to this, it has been deemed a mark of respect, and upon the present occasion it must not be omitted to meditate for a few moments on the tragical end of him whom you are called to succeed. Silence is a sincere sentiment of grief. Let the homage done to his name be perfect, as every particular respecting hfin is such. "},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 215 The Master pronounces C IVI : the brethren put one knee to the ground. The Master knocks thrice ; and the brethren place their heads on their hands for a few moments, in a pensive posture. The Master then says C AKI : the brethren rise to sa- lute each other, and unanimously address the candidate :—We adopt Moabon as our brother an d we acknowledge him to be our Grand Master. V. P. Very honourable brother, it is with extreme pleasure that I behold your proclamation to an illustrious Superinten- dent Scotch Master. Words will not express the sentiments which my heart dictates. I will, however, confide to you the mysteries which are reserved fo r this degree. Advance and receive them. The sash will give you authority over Masons of an inferior order. To distinguish ourselves as Superintendent Scotch Masters, there are three words, tw o signs, and a grip. The words are Urim , Thummin , and Zididiac . The signs are to present the hands in the form of a triangle to the forehead, saying— Triangular at the forehead is my point of support . The other is to put the right ha nd upon the eyes, inclining the head and bending the knee. The grip is to take the two right hands, as in the Architect’s De gree; but, instead of turning them thrice, mutually give three slight strokes with the fore fingers closed. Put the left hand on the brother’s right shoulder and say :— Virtue unites two hearts, two heads, two bodies, and everything makes us one . As Scotch Master, you are to preside in the lodge as soon as you are capable of instructin g the brethren. I shall resign my present power, and shall cheerf ully submit to your govern- ment, as you have conformed to mine. The mysteries of this degree, to which I require your attention, will be best ex- plained in THE CATECHISM . Q. Very honourable brother, are you a Scotch Master ? A. I am. Q.

Very Honourable Superintendent Scotch Masters, this is the ultimatum, the high est number in the archives of Masonry. It is the boundary beyond which there is no passing. This is the last instant of the la st hour of the last year that this lodge is to be held. The very honourable brethren give one knock each until eighty-one are counted, and the lodge is closed. * The continental Masons of the last century bad a tradition among them that pure Masonry had been preserved by the inhabitants of a cave in a moun- tain near Aberdeen. So powerful was th e tradition, that some Gennan Masons were deputed to ascertain from those of Aberdeen, if such were the fact. The ignorant Masons of Aberdeen were astoni shed at such an application, and told the deputation that they were totally ignorant of pure Masonry : indeed, they had a notion that it had only been preserved on the continent.—R.

FORM OF THE LODGE . This lodge is hung with black, strewed with tears. The Master represents Solomon, and is styled Thrice Puissant. He comes to the temple, to the seven exp ert Masters, to repair the loss of Hiram Abiff. In this lodg e there is but one Warden, who is called Adoniram. It is he wh o had the inspection of the workmanship done on Mount Le banon, before the death of Hiram Abiff. He was the first SECRET MASTER . FORM OF THE LODGE . Solomon sits in the east, clothed in black, lined with ermine ; holds a sceptre in his hand ; before him is a triangular altar, on which is a crown of laurels and olive leaves. Adoniram sits in the west, is called inspec tor, and does not make use of any iron tool, because the work was suspended by the death of Hiram Abiff. Solomon is de corated with a broad blue ribbon from his right shoulder to his left hip, at the bottom of which hangs a triangle, but no apron. Adoniram is decorated with a broad white ribbo n, with black borders, has a triangular collar, to which is pendant an ivory key, with the letter Z in the wards. All the brethren have a similar collar and key, with white aprons and black strings. The white signifies the candour and innocence of the Master, and the black the mourning for their ch ief. The flap of the apron is blue, with an eye of gold pain ted on it. This lodge should be lighted with eighty-one lights, in branches of nine to each ; but may be done with three times three. FORM OF OPENING THE LODGE . T. P. Brother Adoniram, are you a Secret Master ? A. Thrice Puissant, I have passed from the square to the compasses, I have seen the tomb of Hiram Abiff, and have, in company, with my brethren, shed many tears over it. T. P. What is the clock ? A. The dawn of day has dr iven away darkness, and the great light begins to shine in this lodge. "},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 219 T. P. If the great light begins to shine in this lodge, and we are all secret Masters, it is tIme to begin our work. Give notice, Brother Adoniram, that I am about to open the lodge. Adoniram gives this notice ; the Thrice Puissant strikes seven times with his hands and ma kes the sign of silence, by putting the two first fingers of his right hand upon his lips. Then all the brethren strike se ven times, and answer the sign by putting the two first fingers of the left hand upon their lips. The Thrice Puissant says : “this lodge is open.” FORM OF RECEPTION OR PASSING . The Blue Master, or candidate, must be examined by an ex- pert Master in his third degree, before be is introduced. He is then bound ; a large square is hung over his face, with a great light in his hand. The master of the ceremonies knocks seven times at the door, when be enters and gives an account to Adoniram, who reports the same to the Thrice Puissant, and desires that he may be introduced to him, Adoniram. He is so introduced, examined, led to the pillow or cushion, and told to kneel on his right knee. Th e Thrice Puissant, seeing him with a square on his forehead, a light in his hand, and kneel- ing, thus addresses him : My dear brother, you have seen little more than a thick veil which covers the sanctum sanctorum of God’s Holy Tem- ple. Your fidelity, fervour, and constancy have gained you the favours which I am now about to grant ; that is to show to you our treasure, and to introduce to you the number destined to fill the loss of our dear brother Hiram Abiff, in hope that God will enable you one day or other to arrive at the secret vault, there to contemplate the pillar of beauty. Do you find yourself capable to k eep the secrets with which we are willing to entrust you; and are you willing to take an obligation ? Candidate. I consent. The penalties of this obligation are, to have the penalties of all former obligations inflic ted, guaranteed by seven repe- titions of the word amen . Adoniram raises candidate, and the Thrice Puissant invests him with a ribbon, key, and ap ron ; crowns him with a crown of laurel and olive leaves ; af ter which he addresses him as follows :— "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 220 My dear brother, I receive you a secret Master, and give you rank among the Levites, to fill the nunlber of one whom we have lost. This laurel represents the victory you are to gain over your passions : the oliv e is the symbol of peace, which ought always to reign among us. It is for you to de- serve the favour, that God may en able you to arrive one day in the secret place to contemplate the pillar of beauty. I de- corate you with an ivory key, hung to a black and white ribbon, as a symbol of your fide lity, innocence, and discretion. The white apron and gloves are the marks of the candour of the secret Master. My dear brother, by the rank which you now have among the Levites, in quality of sec ret Master, you have become the faithful guardian of the temple, and are one of the seven to substitute the loss of Hiram Abi ff, of whose melancholy history you have already been informed. The eye on the flap of your apron is to remind you that you are to keep a careful eye or watch on the workmen in general. Our signs are, first, the one puts two first fingers of the right hand on his lips, and the other answers by the same sign with the left hand. The grip is, first, the Master Masons, then creep up to the elbow and balance seven times, crossing your right leg during the balance. The pass-word is Zizon, a Hebrew word, signifying balus- trade , which is a little row of tu rned pillars. The second word is, Job, Adonai, Ina. Th ey are the three first names which God gave himself to Moses on the mountain: the initials of which you see traced on the triangle. Go, my brother, pass before the brethren, and then listen to our doctrine. LECTURE OR CATECHISM . Q. Are you a secret Master ? A. I am, and glory in it. Q. How were you received a secret Master ? A. I passed from the square to the compasses. Q. Where were you received ? A. In Solomon's Palace. Q. Who made you a secret Master ? "},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 221 A. Solomon, with Adoniram, the inspector of the works of the Temple. Q. Did you perceive anything at your entrance ? A. Evident marks of the Divine presence. Q. Did you distinguish anything particular ? A. I perceived a triangle in a great circle, in the centre of which is enclosed a blazing star , which blinded me with holy respect and contemplation. Q. What signifies the Hebrew character in the triangle ? A. Something beyond the common knowledge of human nature which I cannot pronounce. Q. We are in a lodge, and therefore pronounce it. A. I have seen the great dazzling light without knowing it. Q. What was enclosed in the great brightness ? A. The great ineffable name of the Grand Architect of the Universe. Moses was alone on the mountain when God ap- peared to him and pronounced it . It was forbidden by a law of Moses to be publicly mentio ned, by which the true pronun- ciation was lost ; but I hope one day to arrive at the know- ledge thereof. Q. Did you perceive anything more ? A. I perceived nine other words in Hebrew characters. Q. Where were they placed ? A. In nine beams which came from the luminous triangle. Q. What signify those names ? A. The names which God gave himself, speaking to Moses on the mountain, giving him hopes that his future issue should know the real name. Q. Give them to me, with their signification. A. Eloah, Adonai, Jehovah, Jaohe, Job, Elohim, Echad, Ozze, and Jesai. The nine words are composed of letters which compose seventy-two name s, and are taken from the name of the divinity, according to the angel’s alphabet and the cabalistical tree. Q. What signifies the circle that surrounds the triangle ? A. It is a meteor, which ought to guide us to Divine Providence. Q. What signifies the letter G in the blazing star ? A. Glory, grandeur, gomel. Q. What do you mean by these three words ? A. By glory I mean God: and by grandeur , I mean the "},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 222 man that may be great by perfection : and by gomel , I mean a Hebrew word which signifies thanks to God for his supreme power and goodness. It was the first word that Adam spake when he beheld Eve. Q. What signify the five points of the blazing star ? A. It reminds us of the five orders of architecture which were used in the construction of the Temple ; also of the five senses of nature, without which no man can be perfect. Q. What more did you see ? A. The ark of alliance, the golden candlestick with seven branches, and the table of shew-bread. Q. Where were they placed ? A. In the middle of the sanctum sanctorum. Q. To what do the ark and the blazing star allude ? A. As the ark was the emblem of peace, an alliance which God made with his people, it was put under shadow of the wings of the cherubims. In li ke manner is the circle, which encloses the triangle in the blazing star, under the emblems of the alliance of brother Masons. Q. Of what form was the ark ? A. An oblong square. Q. Of what was it made ? A. Of shittim wood, lined wi thin and without with gold, with a golden crown, and supported with two cherubims of gold. Q. What was the title and purpose of the ark ? A. The propitiatory, or place that served to appease God’s anger. Q. What did the ark contain ? A. The testimony which God gave to Moses on the two tables of the law. Q. What did the two tables contain, and of what were they made ? A. They were made of white marble, and contained the ten complandments in Hebrew, as dictated to Moses by the Al- mighty, and thus divided, the four first respecting our duty to God, and the six last of our duty to man. Q. Of what use was the table ? A. To put the twelve loaves of bread of proportion on, which ought to be always in the pres ence of God, as he ordered Moses. "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 223 Q. Of what were the loaves made ? A. Of the finest flour. Q. How were they placed ? A. Six on the right side and six on the left, forming two heaps. Q. What was put over them ? A. A very pure and bright ewer. Q. Why ? A. In order that they should be an ornament to the obliga- tion made to God. Q. What was the name of the sanctum sanctorum ? A. Debur, a Hebrew word. Q. What does it mean ? A. Speech. Q. Why was it so called ? A. Because there the Divinity resided, and from thence delivered his oracles. Q. Who constructed the ark ? A. When Moses was ordered by God to construct the ark he made choice of Bazaleel, th e son of Uri, of the tribe of Judah, the son of Mariam, sister to Moses. He likewise chose Aholiab, the son of Ahishemek, of the tribe of Dan ; two able workmen for that purpose. Upon these occasions, the people of Israel showed so much ardour and zeal, that Moses, by the advice of those who had the direction of the work, was obliged by the sound of the tnunpet to make it known that he had no further occasion for more assistance. Moses likewise had par- ticular directions for the number of vessels for the tabernacle and for the use of the sacrifices. Q. How comes the candlestick to be composed of seven branches ? A. Because the No. 7 represents the number of the planets. Q. What was on the top of each of them ? A. A lamp, and each pointed north and south. Q. Of how many parts did they consist ? A. Seventy. Q. What does that number of parts represent ? A. The twelve signs of the Zodiac, through which the planets move. Q. What does the fixed eye in the lodge present ? A. One only light, that dispels the darkness from us. "},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 224 Q. How did they get up into the galleries of the temple ? A. By a staircase, contrived as a screw in the inner wall of the temple, by which they asce nded, by three, five, or seven steps. It is called Cockles, because it is made like a screw. Q. How many doors are there in the sanctum sanctorum ? A. Only one—in the east, which was covered with purple, hyacinth, gold, and azure. Q. What do these colours represent ? A. The four elements. Q. How old are you ? A. Three times twenty-seven, which are ejghty-one. Q. What is your pass-word ? A. Zizon. FORM OF CLOSING THE LODGE T. P. Brother Inspector, what is the clock ? A. The close of the day. T. P. What remains to be done ? A. To practice virtue, shun vice, and renlain in silence. The Thrice Puissant, addressing himself to the brethren, says : as nothing is to be done but to practice virtue, and to shun vice, we will be silent, an d let the will of the Lord be done. It is time to rest. Brother Inspector, give notice to the brethren, that I am about to close the lodge by the mysterious number. The Inspector repeats this to the brethren. The Thrice Puissant claps seven times with his hands, and then all the brethren imitate him. He makes the sign of silence, which they answer, and the lodge is closed. ———— A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF PERFECT MASTER. FORM OF THE LODGE . This lodge is hung with green ornaments and with four white columns, erected at equal distances on each side. It is illuminated by sixteen lights, four at each angle of the cardinal points. In the east is a red canopy, with a table before it co- vered with black and strewed with tears. "},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 225 The Thrice Puissant, Illustriou s, Respectable, and Worship- ful Master, who presides, represents the noble Adoniram, the son of Abda, of the tribe of Da n, who conducted the works of the Temple, before the arrival of Hiram Abiff at Jerusalem. Afterwards, he was sent to mo unt Lebanon, to inspect the work that was there carrying on for the use of the Temple. He was recalled on the death or Hiram Abiff, and had the honour of being the first of the seven that were substituted in his stead. He is decorated wi th the orders of the degree of perfection, and those of Prince of Jerusalem. He sits in Solomon’s chair under a canopy, holding a setting maul. There is but one warden, who represents Stolkin. He is ornamented with a jewel of pe rfection, and sits in the west, holding a mallet. He does the duty of Inspector. The master of the ceremonies represents Zerbel or Beneia, Captain of King Solomon’s Guards. He is decorated with a green ribbon round his neck, in the form of a collar, to which is hung a pair of compasses, the points of which form an angle of ninety degrees ; which is the jewel of th is degree. His apron is white, lined with green, and he carries a naked sword in his hand. All the brethren are decorated in the same manner with Zerbel, with a similar collar, jewel, and apron ; the flaps of the apron down, and the jewel embroidered or painted thereon. In the middle of the apartment are painted four circles on a square stone, with the letter I in the centre ; the outer circle enclosing the other three. FORM OF OPENING THE LODGE . T. P. I. R. W. M.

The candidate or secret Master being in the preparing room, decorated as such, the master of the ceremonies moves from his seat in solemn silence, and striking the Inspector four times on the right shoulder, thus addresses him :—Venerable Bro- ther Inspector, Brother N——, a secret Master is now in the antechamber, and solicits the favour of being admitted a Perfect Master. The Inspector then reports him to the chair, on which the Thrice Puissant, Illustrious, Respectable, and Worshipful Master asks :—Is he deserving this honour, and do you answer for his zeal, fervour, and constancy ? S. Thrice Puissant, Illustrious, Respectable, and Worshipful Master, I do. T. P. I. R. W. M. Let him then be instructed in the usual manner. The Inspector orders the master of the ceremonies to go and introduce the candidate, who is to be first examined in the former degrees. He is also dive sted of his sword and every thing offensive. A green silk cord is thrown round his neck, both ends of which are held by the master of the ceremonies in his left hand, with a naked sword in his right. He is thus led to the door of the lodge, on which the master of the cere- monies strikes four times. The Inspector inside repeats the four knocks, and informs the lodge that somebody knocks as Perfect Master. The Thrice Pui ssant, Illustrious, Respectable, and Worshipful Master orders the Inspector to inquire who knocks. The Inspector orders the Tiler to open the door cau- tiously, and to inquire who it is . The Tiler obeys, and is an- swered by Zerbel, that Brother N——, a secret Master, is "},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 227 desirous of being admitted to the honours of a Perfect Master. The Tiler then shuts the door , and reports the candidate’s request to the Inspector, who communicates it to the Thrice Puissant, Illustrious, Respectable, and Worshipful Master, who orders the candidate to be introduced. The door is opened, and he is led to the south side, near the tomb, having the sign of a secret Master on him. Th e Thrice Puissant, Illustrious, Respectable, and Worshipful Master, seeing him in that atti- tude thus addresses him: — What do you desire, my brother ? C ANDIDATE . The favour of being received a perfect Master. T. P. I. R. W. M. Brother Inspector, teach the brother to travel. The Inspector leads him by th e green silk cord from the south passing by the west, four times round the lodge. At each angle he gives the differen t signs, from the apprentice upward, and does the same every time he passes the Master. After which, he is carried to the tomb, which he is made to cross saltier (by a leap). He is th en led up to the altar, with his right knee a little bent, having still the sign of a secret Master on him. After a short pause the Thrice Puissant, Il- lustrious, Respectable, and Worshipful Master bids him ad- vance, kneel, and lay his hand on the Bible, to take the obliga- tion. The penalty of which is di shonour, in addition to all for- mer obligations and penalties. The Thrice Puissant, Illustriou s, Respectable, and Worship- ful Master takes one end of the cord that is round the candi- date’s neck and draws it off, sa ying : my dear brother, I draw you from your vicious life, and by the virtue of the power which I have received from the most illustrious of Kings, I raise you to the dignity of a Perfect Master, on condition that you fulfil and faithfully observe every thing that is prescribe by our bye-laws. This the candidate promises to do. The first sign of this degree is a sign of admiration. Extend your arms, open your hands, an d look towards heaven. Then let your hands fall, and cross them on your belly as low as you can, with your eyes looking mournfully towards the earth. The second sign is, to bring the toes of your right foot reci- procally to each other, until your knees touch. Lay your hand on your heart, and then draw it across your breast, forming a square with your elbow. "},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 228 The third sign is, to clench each other’s wrist, like the Mas- ters : carry your left hand between each other's shoulders, and press four times hard with the fingars on the back, when you give the Master’s word, wh ich is Mahabone or Macbe- nach. Then, interlace the four fingers of your right hand with the thumbs upright, pa ssing against each other and forming a square. The pass-word is Acassia : the sacred word gave . HISTORY OF THIS DEGREE . Solomon, having been inform ed that the body of Hiram Abiff was found and already deposited on the outside of the temple, towards the north, near to a well, in which his Jewel had been found, was happy to have the poor consolation of finding the precious remains of so great a man. He gave or- ders and strict charge to his Grand Inspector, the noble Ado- niram, that the funeral obsequies should be as pompous and magnificent as for the king himself. He likewise ordered that all the brethren should a ttend it with white aprons and gloves, and strictly forbad that the bloody stains should be washed away, until he had wrea ked his vengeance on the per- petrators of the horrid deed. The noble Adoniram, chief of the works of the temple, soon fi nished a plan for a beautiful monument, which was erected and fi nished in nine days. It was made of black and white ma rble. The heart of Hiram Abiff was enclosed in an urn, and exposed for nine days on the three steps of the sanctum sanctorum, previous to the finishing of the temple, and. then placed on the top of a beau- tiful obelisk, which was built on the side of the temple, at the west door, a little to the north, in order to mark out the place where the murderers had first deposited him in a pit, before they removed him to the place where Stolkin found Jiim under the sprig of Cassia. The hear t of the excellent Hiram Abiff was then exposed to public view in the urn with a sword run through it. The brethren came to express their grief on the occasion, kneeling on the first step which led to the sanctum sanctorum. At the expiration of nine days, the heart was deposited on the obelisk, and covered with a triangular stone, on which was engraved, in Hebrew , the characters I. M. B. The I is the initial letter of th e ancient master's word, and M. B. are initials of the new word. A sprig of Cassia was en- graved over the I. "},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 229 After this, Solomon had all the triangular medals taken from the Masters, and the Master ’s word changed to that now wven in the third degree. The body of the respectable Hiram Abiff was buried in the middle of the great chamber, separated from the temple, with all the honours due to so great a man. It was in this chamber that Solomon used to hold his cbapter, and confer with Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, on the sacred mysteries. Three da ys after the ceremonies were over, Solomon, surrounded by a ll his court, went to the Tem- ple, and all the workmen were placed in the same order as on the day of the funeral. The ki ng offered up a prayer to the Almighty, then examined the tomb, the canopy, the repeated triangle, and the letters which were engraved thereon. He also examined the pyramid, and finding everything perfectly executed, he cried, in ecstasy— CONSUMMATUM EST . All the brethren answered with the sign of admiration, and said, Amen, amen, amen. CATECHISM . Q. Are you a perfect Master ? A. I have seen the circle and the square enclosing the two columns. Q. Where were they placed ? A. On the place where was deposited the body of our Master Hiram Abiff. Q. What do the columns represent ? A. The columns of Jachin and Boaz, through which I must have passed to arrive at the degree of Perfect Master. Q. What could Solomon mean by establishing this degree ? A. He did it in honour of Hi ram Abiff, in order to imprint on the minds of the people an unaffected love and respect for his memory, and to incite in them a desire to find out his mur- derers ; for, at this time, it was not known of the murderers’ audaciousness to mix themselves with the brethren, and to par- take in the general expressions of consternation and grief, in order to conceal their guilt, an d prevent suspicion. Solomon, to ascertain this ordered a general muster of all the workmen, and found that they all answere d to their names excepting the ruffians who had run away. He therefore ordered the noble Adoniram to build an elegant monument for him, at the west- south-west part of the temple, th at there the body should be "},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 230 privately interred, and no brother admitted to the knowledge of it, who was not a secret master . The body was also privately embalmed and some time after removed to another apartment, separated from the temple, where the King held the chapter. The heart of that great man, af ter being exposed nine days, on the third step of the sanctum sa nctorum, and having received the homage of the brethren who kn elt on the first step, was then deposited in the urn, and fixed on the top of the obelisk, with a sword pierced through it, implying that such an atrocious deed had cried aloud for public vengeance. Q. What instructions have you received from the different degrees through which you have passed ? A. By them I have learned to regulate my morals, to cleanse my heart from all stain, in order to qualify myself for the high desire of perfection, at which I hope some day to arrive. Q. What does the square aton e in the middle of the circle mean ? A. It teaches us, that the foundation of our building must be laid on a living rock , of which we are originally formed. Q. For what are the circles ? A. They are an emblem of the Divinity, which hath neither beginning nor end. Q. What do they altogether represent ? A. The creation of the universe, which was accomplished by the will of God, and the pow er which he gave to the primi- tive qualities. Q. What do you mean by. primitive qualities ? A. I mean heat, cold, and mo isture, from the combination of which the four elements sprung. Q. How came they to be mentioned here ? A. In order to remind us, that God is everywhere, and that without the divine influence, no solid building can be raised. Q. What does the letter I, in the middle of the square stone signify ? A. It is the initial letter of the Perfect Master’s word. Q. Will you pronounce it ? A. Jave. Q. What does it mean ? "},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 231 A. It is the name by which I know the Grand Architect of the Universe. Q. How have you been received Perfect Master ? A. By a point to my heart and a rope round my neck. Q. Why a point to your heart ? A. In memory that I have consented that my heart should be plucked out. Q. Why had you a rope round your neck ? A. To teach me that by th is humbling power, I must not pride myself in the progress which I make in Masonry and virtue. Q. How many signs have you ? A. One by five. Q. Why one by five ? A. To call to my memory th e degrees through which I have passed. Q. How many tokens have you ? A. One by five, which reminds me of my five points of entrance. Q. What are they ? A. The four rounds about the Temple, and the fifth, the sign of admiration. Q. What does the tomb represent, which you perceived when you entered the lodge ? A. The burial of our respectful Master Abiff, in the valley. Q. Why is it placed at the north part of the sanctuary ? A. To teach us, that a man must divest himself of all worldly care, to be qualified to enter the sanctum sanctorum. Q. What is the meaning of the rope that comes from the coffin in the north, goes by the obelisk in the south, and binds the columns together which are fixed crossways ? A. It represents the rope which the brethren made to draw up the body, and afterwards to le t down the coffin. That rope was made of green and white. Q. Does it signify anything else ? A. It further signifies, that we have broken through the darkness of sin. Q. What have you done in entering the lodge ? A. I came to the altar, work ing as an Entered Apprentice, Fellow-Craft, and .Master: to cross the two columns. "},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 232 Q. Why so ? A. To remind me, that it was by the means of having passed through those degrees, that I have obtained the honour of being made a Perfect Master. Q. Is there no mystery couched under this explanation ? A. It teaches us that we ca nnot arrive at the sanctum sanc- torum by any other method than by a purity of morals, a rec- titude of intention and secrecy, which are to be learnt in the first degree. Q. Why did you enter the sanctum sanctorum by the side ? A. That I might learn by it to avoid the common way of mankind. Q. What is your colour ? A. Green. Q. For what reason ? A. To imprint on my mind, that, being dead to sin, I ex- pect to gain new life by practi ce of virtue, and to make a pro- gress by these means in the sublime science, which I hope some day to be acquainted with, by arriving at the highest degree. Q. Who can communicate them to you ? A. God alone, whose knowledge is infinite. Q. What do the two pyramids on your draft represent, one being in the south and the other in the north, and what signify the figures on them ? A. The two pyramids represent Egypt, where the sciences were much cultivated, and whence some had their origin. On the South pyramid is drawn the meteor which guided the Mas- ter, in search of the body of Hiram Abiff ; and on the north pyramid, the Perfect Master Mason’s Jewel is represented. Q. What does the Perfect Master Mason’s Jewel signify ? A. It puts us in mind, that as Perfect Masters, we should act according to the strict rules of propriety, caution, and attention\" in the whole tenor of our proceedings through life. Q. What was the name of the Master of the Apprentices ? A. His name was Boaz, and to him Solomon dId the honour of calling the column on the left side of the Temple after him. Q. Who was the Master of the Fellow-Craft ? A. His name was Jachin, a man much esteemed and re- spected by Solomon, who did him the honour of calling the nght hand pillar after his name, and at which place he paid the Crafts their wages.. "},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 233 Q. What was the name of the Master of the Masters ? A. His name was Mahabone or Macbenach, a very virtuous man, held in the highest esteem by Solomon, and one of the first intendants of his building. He was also the intimate friend of Hiram Abiff, which in duced Solomon to send him in search of the body of his deceased friend, when every former attempt to find it had proved ineffectual. Solomon ordered him to go, and requested three th ings of him ? first, that he should bring back that respectable man’s jewel ; second, that he should bring with him that ever-to-be-Iamented man, dead or alive ; and third, that he should discover the perpetrators of that horrid deed. Q. Did Macbenach comply with these three orders ? A. With fifteen others, who were chosen to attend him on this search, he first went to the Temple, where, seeing the blood that had been spilt in many parts, he traced it to a well in the north part of the Temple , whence he concluded, that Hiram Abiff had been killed and thrown into this well. Thus prompted, and further encouraged by a luminous meteor which stood over the well, he de termined to have it drawn dry. This being done, he went down into it, found not the body, but the Master’s jewel. It appears, that Hiram Abiff, when attacked by the ruffians, must have plucked off this jewel, and thrown it into the well near the great staircase, rather than it should fall into th e hands of such villains. Mac- benach blessed heaven, and jointly with his companions, offered up a prayer of thanksgiving for their signal success. After this they went on, in order to comply with the other part of their instructions. Th ey had the meteor still for their guide, when they stopped at a small hill between Lydria and Joppa, to rest awhile, and then it was that Brother Stolkin found the body of the respectable Hiram Abiff, as is related in the third degree. FORM OF CLOSING THE LODGE . T. P. I. R. W. M. What is the clock, Brother Stolkin ? S. Thrice Puissant, Illustriou s, Respectable, and Worship- ful Adoniram, it is five o’clock. T. P. I. R. W. M.

SECRETARY, OBTAINED BY CURIOSITY, OR ENGLISH MASTER’S DEGREE. FORM OF THE LODGE . This lodge is lighted with tw enty-seven lamps, in three branches, nine in each, and placed, as in the third degree, east, west, and south, hung wi th black, and strewed with tears. At a reception, there are only tw o brethren in this lodge, who represent Solomon, King of Israel, and Hiram, King of Tyre. They are dressed in blue robes, lined with ermine, with crowns on their heads, and sceptres in their hands. A table stands between them, on which are placed two swords, a cross, and a roll of parchment. The brethren in this lodge, are called Perfect Masters, wear white aprons, lined, bordered, and trimmed with fiery red, a collar of the same to hang round their necks, with a plain triangle painted on the flap of the apron, and white gloves bordered with red. The room in which this lodge is held represents the Hall of Audience for Masons. It is opened and closed by twenty- seven knocks of a hammer, nine strokes at short intervals, and an interval betweeen the eighth and ninth. FORM OF OPENING . Solomon strikes his twenty-seven, and Hiram does the same. The brethren present bend their right knees, cross their hands, and raise them so that their thumbs touch their fore- "},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 235 head. Then, altogether, they repeat the word Jova in a low voice. They then draw thei r swords and retire ; Solomon having appointed them guards, with a captain and lieutenant, whose business it is to see that the others behave themselves with decency, to keep the lodg e well tiled, and to drive away brethren who would come near it : thus there remain in the lodge only the two kings. FORM OF RECEPTION . The candidate being in the anti-chamber, the Captain of the Guards orders one of the men to take away his hat, sword, gloves, apron, and jewel of Perfec t Master. He is then placed at the lodge-door, which is purpos ely left on the jar, that he may peep in at the two kings. When he is well fixed, the Guards make a noise, which be ing heard by Hiram, he looks about, and seeing a man peeping, throws up his hands and cries in a rage: O heavens ! we are overheard ! Solomon says, that cannot be, as my guards are at the door. Hiram, without reply, runs to the door, seizes the listener by the hands, and drags him into Solomon’s presen ce, and says, here, see then ! Solomon asks what shall be done with him. Hiram says we must put him to death, and puts his hand on his sword. Solomon quits his place, runs to Hiram, lays his hand upon the sword, and says : Stop, my brother . He then strikes hard on the table, on which the Ca ptain and his Guards enter and salute the kings, by drawing th eir right hands from their left shoulder to their right hip. Solo mon says to them : take away this guilty man, and let him be forthcoming when wanted : your lives must answer for him. ( They depart with the prisoner .) Solomon and Hiram remain alone for some time, as if in contemplation, and talking very low. Solomon strikes the table loudly, when the Captain and his guards enter, leading the candidate, and remain with hi m in the west, till by a sign given by Solomon, they bring him before the throne. The brethren then take their places, and Solomon thus addresses the candidate :— By my treaties and solicitatio ns, I have so far prevailed on my ally, the King of Tyre, whom you by your curiosity, had so offended, as to oblige him to pronounce a sentence of death upon you ; I have so far p revailed on him, as not only to procure his pardon for your o ffence, but have even obtained "},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 236 his consent to receive you as an Intimate Secretary to the arti- cles of our new alliance. Do yo u think that you can inviolably keep secret what we are about to communicate to you, and will you bind yourself to do it by an inviolable obligation ? Answer. I do and will. The penalty of this obligation is to have the body opened, entrails plucked out, heart to rn to pieces, and the whole thrown to the wild beasts of the forests, guaranteed by three amens. Solomon then shows the draft of the lodge to the candidate, and thus explains it to him. The window represented in the clouds is an emblem of the dome of the Temple. In the glass of it is the letter I, which is the initial of the name of the Grand Architect of the Universe, Jova . The building at a distance represents Solomon’s Palace, with the door and great gate to go in by the mauso leum. The tears marked out re- present the mason’s audience ch amber, hung with black, where Solomon used to shut himself up, when he could spare a minute from business, to lament the un happy fate of Hiram Abiff. It was in this chamber, that Hiram King of Tyre, found him in a deep meditation, when he ca me to visit him. The letter A signifies alliance ; the first P to the right of the mausoleum promise ; the other to the left perfection . Solomon orders the candidate to advance, and says to him, I receive you as Intimate Secretar y, on the condition that you will as faithfully fulfil your du ty, and be as much attached to this order, as the person was whom you are about to succeed in office. The colour of the ribbon with which I now decorate you must ever bring to your memory the wounds which that great man received from the tr aitors who so inhumanly mur- dered him ; and, likewise, of the blood which he rather chose to spill than to reveal the sec rets with which I am about to entrust you. We expect, my brot her, that your fidelity will be proof against all temptations and dangers ; and that the sword which I give you will serve to protect you against any villain who shall dare attempt to surprise you into a confession of our mysteries. The first sign is to draw your right hand from your left shoulder to your right hip, as the penalty of your obligation. The second sign is to raise bo th your hands, cross them, and let them fall by your sword, at the same time lifting up your eyes to heaven. "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 237 The grip is to take each ot her’s right hand, in the usual manner of saluting. The one tu rns the other’s hand, and says Berith , which signifies alliance . The other turns and says Neder , which is promise . The first turns again, and says Shilomoth . The pass-word is Joabert , which is the name of the favourite of Solomon, that peeped in at the door, and the answer is Zerbel , the name of the Captain of the Guards. The sacred word is Jova . HISTORY OF THIS DEGREE . Solomon, in consequence of the treaty established between him and the ambassadors of Hira m, King of Tyre, solemnly covenanted to furnish Hiram with a certain number of mea- sures of oil, honey, and wheat, and a grant of province con- sisting of thirty governments, in exchange for timber, hewn, formed, and drawn from the Forest of Lebanon, by King Hiram’s people, and hewn stones to be formed in the quarries of Tyre, and fitted for immediate us e. This treaty was to have been fulfilled as the Temple should be finished. But Solomon allowed a year to elapse, withou t paying any regard to its ful- filment ; during which, Hiram visited the province, and had the mortification to find it a barren and sandy soil, inhabited by an uncultivated people, so that its possession was rather likely to be a burthen than a be nefit. Not hearing from Solo- mon, he determined to go in person to Jerusalem, to expos- tulate with him for haying neglected to comply with the terms of the treaty. On his arrival, he entered the palace, went through the guard room, where Solomon’s court was assem- bled, and rushed direct]y into the king’s apartment, who happened to be alone, bemoaning the loss of Hiram Abiff. Hiram walked so hastily, and seemingly in so passionate a manner, as to raise the suspicio n of Joabert, one of Solomon’s favourites. Struck with a notion that Hiram had some evil design on Solomon, Joabert follo wed to the door to listen, and was discovered there by Hiram, who exclaimed :—“ O hea- vens ! we are discovered ! ” and running to the door, seized Joabert by the hand and dragged him into Solomon’s presence, saying, here he is ! Solomon, who could not doubt the tres- pass, said, what shall we do wi th this criminal ? Hiram replied, we must kill him, and drew his sword for that pur- "},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 238 pose; on which Solomon, rushing from his throne, cried, stop, my brother, and suspend your wr ath awhile. He gave a hard knock on the table, on which the guards came in. Solomon said to them, seize that guilty man, and be answerable for his appearance when, requested . The guards retired with their prisoner, and Solomon thus addressed Hiram. This man, sir, is the only person among my favourites, and the lords of my court, who has zeal and an affectionate attachment to my person. I know him sufficiently to be convinced that his in- discretion is less to be attribut ed to an imprudent curiosity, than to his apprehensions for my safety. Your looks, change of countenance, and hasty ma nner of passing through the guard room, were the causes th at excited his curiosity and alarm for my person. I, therefo re, entreat of you to recall the sentence of death which you ha ve pronounced against him, and I will be answerable for his zeal and discretion. Hiram, seeing how agreeable it would be to Solomon that his favour- ite should be pardoned, readily consented, and the two kings renewed their treaty, which was to be perpetual with differ- ent claims, and promises on both sides of lasting friendship, to which Joabert was Intimate Secretary. This, my dear brother, is what is represented to you in your reception as In- timate Secretary. CATECHISM . Q. Are you an Intimate Secretary ? A. I am ( with the eyes lifted to heaven .) Q.

Adoniram receives from the candidate the sign, token, and word of the three first degrees ; after which he leads him to the door of the lodge, and knoc ks three, five, and seven times, at intervals. The door is opene d by a brother, to whom Adoni- ram says,—The brother, whom I introduce, is one who works "},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 242 in the middle chamber. He is a llowed to pass, and is taken by the hand by Adoniram, with the master’s grip, to the middle of the lodge, where he is instructed to kneel on a square flag stone, opposite to a table, behind which Tito sits, who puts a sprig of cassia, or any other g reen sprig, into his hand, and then, in that position, he takes the obligation : the penalty of which is, to observe all rules la id down by the grand council of the princes of Jerusalem, un der the penalty of all former obligations, with the addition, ‘that his body may be severed in two, and bowels torn out, and given as a prey to the fowls of the air, in justice and equity.’ Amen. Amen. .Amen. The obligation over, a brother comes behind, covers him with a red veil, lifts him up, sets him on a stool in the middle of the lodge, and thus addresses him :— My dear brother—Solomon, King of Israel, being willing and desirous to carry on to the high est degree of perfection, if pos- sible, the works commenced by Hiram Abiff, he has thought proper, to effect this business, to employ the five chiefs of the five orders in architecture, assisted by the three Princes of Harodim, Tito, Abda, and his son Adoniram. He was well convinced of their zeal and abilit ies, and therefore hoped to see the work completed in a master ly manner. We flatter our- selves, my dear brother, that you will contribute with all your might to this grand end. As you represent a dead man, it must be to you an emblem, that, in order to succeed in this great work, you must execute it with the same spirit as our respectable master, Hiram Abiff, would have done. You must also be possessed of the same spirit and resolution as he was— which was to prefer death to the divulging of the mysteries of the Order. We hope you will follow his example. I will now raise you, not as you were raised before, but as Hiram Abiff was raised by Stolkin. Adoniram takes the candidate’s right elbow in his left hand, with the right gives him the ma ster’s grip, and, by three pulls, lifts him and throws the veil fr om his face. All the Puissant Grand Masters give him the sign, token, and word. The first sign is that of amazement and surprise, which is done by lifting your hands as hi gh as your cheeks, the fingers perpendicular, and both thumbs touching the ears, so as to form two squares. In walking, you stop as if astonished ; and when standing, throw your body back. "},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 243 The second sign is to clap your right hand to your forehead with your fingers and nails turned on the eyes, and say,— Ben- horam . Your brother answers by interlacing the fingers of both hands, and by putting the ba ck part of them to the left side of the belly, and looking up to heaven, says,— Echad . The third sign is that of grief, figurative of the Fellow Craft’s sign. Carry your right hand to your heart, and at the same time your left hand low down on the left side, as if to struggle. Then move your elbow three times in a circu1ar manner from side to side, and say,— Ky ; to which the other responds,— Jaca . The token is to touch each othe r’s heart, pass and take each other with the right hand by th e middle of the arm, and, with the left hand, by the elbow : pass it three times. The one utters the grand word Jachinai , and the other answers Judah . CATECHISM . Q. Are you an Intendant of the Building ? A. I have taken five steps of exactitude, and have penetrated into the inner part of the temple. I have seen the effects of the great and resplendent light, in the middle of which I have seen, in Hebrew characters, the three mysterious letters—I, I, I,— without knowing what they mean. Q. How were you received Intendant of the Building ? A. By acknowledging my ignorance. Q. Why were you raised to that degree ? A. In order to expel the dark ness in which I am encircled, and to get such light as would regulate my heart, and enlighten my understanding. Q. In what place were you introduced ? A. In a place full of wonder and charms, where virtue and sovereign wisdom reside. Q. What is the duty of an Intendant of the Building ? A. To keep the brethren steady in the practice of virtue, by setting them a good example to correct their works. Q. Why is it required, in this degree, before you are ad- mitted, to show that you are well instructed in the three first degrees of Masonry ? A. To shew that it is only gradually that we can arrive at perfection. Q. What do you learn from the three first degrees ? "},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 244 A. The first teaches moral virtue ; the second, political vir- tue ; and the third, heroic virtue. Q. Why were you obliged to take your steps backwards as well as forwards in your di.fferent degrees ? A. To show that the progre ss towards virtue was slow and gradual ; that we must by humility curb that pride which is natural to us, before we can pres ume to hope for perfection : and also, that we must judge so far impartially of our actions, and so far effectually govern ou r passions, as not to leave any- thing exceptionable in our conduct. Q. Can you explain the mysteries of our lodge ? A. I will endeavour to do it in the best manner I can. Q. What do the three mysteries in your jewel signify ? A. Jachinai signifies divine beauty—Judah divine wisdom. The three letters I, in the middle of the triangle of the blazing star, are the initials of the sacred and nameless word. Q. What does the circle in the inside of the third triangle imply ? A. The immensity of God’s power, which hath neither be- ginning nor end. Q. What do the three in the circle mean ? A. Oh ! the Eternal alone possesseth the attributes of Di- vinity. Q. What are the chief attributes of the Divinity ? A. Beauty 6. Omniscience 11. Justice 7. Wisdom 7. Eternity 8. Compassion 10. Boundless 10. Perfection 8. Creation and mercy 14. These make in all the number 81. Q. Explain to me the square of nine, which you see in the triple triangle. A. Nine, thrice multiplied by three, makes 81. Q. Why do you place Solomon, King of Israel, in the tem- ple ? A. In memory of his being the first who constructed a tem- ple to his Lord. Q. Why do you place a brazen sea in the temple ? A. To let us know that th e temple of God is holy, and that we must not enter it before we are purified from all un- cleanness. Q. What does the left side of the temple signify ? A. Masonry, under the laws of types and ceremonies. Q. What does the right side of the temple signify ? "},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 245 A. Freemasonry, under the laws of grace and truth. Q. What is the meaning of the tomb, which is under the threshold of the door of the sa nctuary in your degrees of Per- fect Master and Provost and Judge ? A. It shows that we must be purified by death, before we can enter into the mansions of bliss. Q. What does the candlestick with seven branches signify ? A. The presence of the Holy Spirit in the heart of those who faithfully observe the law. Q. Why are you barefooted at the time of reception ? A. Because Moses was so when on the mount. Q. What did you hear before you entered the lodge ? A. Five great strokes. Q. What do they denote ? A. The five points of felicity. Q. What happened in consequence, and what was done with you ? A. A warden immediately appeared, who supported and carried me round the temple five times. Q. What was his intention in so doing ? A. Surprise, wonder, and grief took possession of my mind all the time. Q. Why were you thus affected ? A. I was thus affected at the sight of what was enclosed in the blazing star. Q. Pray what could that be ? A. Something that was mysterious, and appertaining to the Grand Architect of the universe, which I hope to be ac- quainted with in time. Q. Why had the stars five points or rays ? A. It was to show, first, th at in the construction of the temple the five orders of archit ecture were made use of : second, to represent the five points of feli city : third, the five senses, without which man is imperfect : fourth, the five lights of Masonry : and fifth, the five zones of Masonry. Q. What are the five points of felicity ? A. To walk, to intercede for, to pray, to love, and to assist your brethren, so as to be united with them in heart and mind. Q. Why were you seized with wonder ? A. It was on seeing the beauty and ornaments of the temple, whereof I saw but a part. "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 246 Q. Why did you not see the whole ? A. A thick veil concealed a pa rt of my view; but I hope that the strong desire which I have to improve in my zeal for the royal art will disperse the cloud in time, which now obstructs my sight from them. Q. Why were you seized with grief ? A. Because all the wonders I saw brought to my remem- brance the melancholy end of our respectable master, Hiram Abiff. Q. How were you made to walk ? A. By the five points of exactness. Q. And what do you mean by this ? A. I mean the five solemn steps which I took in advancing to the foot of the throne of th e powerful King of Israel, where I took my obligation in his presence. Q. Why, at your reception, were you obliged to represent a dead man ? A. It denotes to us that good Masons should be silent to the world, and refrain from its vices. Q. What do the scales imply which are put into your hands ? A. An emblem of justice to my brethren. By the said scales I ought also to weigh my own ac tions, and to regulate my own conduct, in order to justify the good opinion conceived of me by appointing me a master in lsrael, and an Intendant of the Building. Q. Have you Seen your illu strious and Perfect Master to- day ? A. I have seen him. Q. Where was he placed, and how clad ? A. He was placed in the east under a canopy bespangled with brilliant stars, and clad with azure and gold. Q. Have you any remains of darkness about you ? A. The morning star lights me, and the mysterious stars guide me. Q. Where were you thus conducted ? A. I cannot tell you. Q. How old are you ? A. Twenty-seven. Q. What number have you marked ? A. Five, seven, and fifteen. Q. Where did you remark them, and what do you mean ? "},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 247 A. I remarked them in the arrangement of the lights, and have already explained the, two first numbers. The last re- presents the fifteen masters, headed by Mahabone, who found the body of Hiram Abiff.

How were you prepared as a Past Master of arts and sciences ? P. M. In the character of a Master Mason, and properly hoodwinked. W. M. Why were you hoodwinked ? P. M. To point out to me, that the secrets of this degree, perceptible by vision, were to be hidden from my sight, until the light of my understanding had qualified me to receive them. W. M. What procured you admission ? P. M. Four distinct knocks, and the pass-word of a Master Mason. W. M. In what manner did yo u enter the lodge of a past Master ? "},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 248 P. M. Upon four points of geometry, formed by the square and compasses united, and the letter G in the centre. W. M. Why were you initiated in this manner ? P. M. Because the compasses are the principal instruments belonging to the master mason; and the two points elevated above the points of the square, denoted that I had arrived at the summit of operative Masonry. The letter G in the centre was the proper passport, that be ing the initial of the pass- word of this degree, signifying a Mason that is master of his profession. W. M. In what manner were you then dealt with ? P. M. I was conducted in th e usual form, and by the proper steps of advancing, to receive the obligation. W. M. In what manner were you placed to receive the obli- gation ? P. M. Upon both my knees, my hands upon the Holy Bible and my mouth holding a pair of compasses over my hands. W. M. What was the reason of this peculiar position of rhw compasses ? P. M. As my hands had been instrumental in duly executing the noblest parts of operative Masonry, my mouth was thus employed to denote that I was th en about to be passed as a Past Master of Arts and Sciences. And as my head was then con- fined with the compasses by my hands on the Holy Bible, it strongly figured to my mind th at the compass of God’s word was to be the standard of every operation in my future life, that I might thereby arrive at the summit of Masonry, by passing through the speculative degree of this mortal life, to that glorious and celestial lodge where the grand pass-word of the Almighty Architect will procure us admission, and with whom, peace, order, and harmony, will eternally reign. W. M. Be pleased to arise, and in proper position deliver the obligation. [The additional penalty of this obligation is to have the hands struck off at the wrist.] W. M. How did you confirm it ? P. M. With my lips four times on the Holy Bible. W. M. In what manner were you raised ? P. M. By the grip of a Past Master. W. M. Be pleased to advance, and give it to me with the first sign. "},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 249 [The grip is to lay hold of the left hand of one brother by the right of the other, at the wr ist, grasping it tight. The sign, to place the thumb perpen dicular on the lips, between the nose and chin, is indicative of silence.] W. M. To what do they allude ? P. M. The grip alludes to the part of the obligation, of having my hands struck off at th e wrists ; and the sign alludes to that other part of the obliga tion, of having my arms struck off from my body and both hung at my breast, suspended at the neck, as an index of infamy till time and putridity consume the same. W. M. Be pleased to deliver the second sign and its signi- fication. ( By extending the arm at length, and, with the thumb and finger, as if holding the plumb-line ). P. M. It alludes to the manner of distinguishing a brother of this degree at such a distan ce, that it prevents us from making use of any other method. W. M. Be pleased to communicate the chief word, and its signification. P. M. Giblum or Chibbelum. It means a workman who is master of his profession; but more especially alluding to the excellency of the sculpture, in the stone-work of Solomon’s temple. W. M. To what does the pass-grip allude ? P. M. That memorable characteristic which distinguished the ancient Sidonia workmen at the building of Solomon’s temple. W. M. To what does the pass-word allude ? P. M. To the first and most distinguished workmen in the Porphyry stone-work, during the erection of that edifice. W. M. What is the distinguishing mark or signature used by the brothers of this degree ? P. M. The initial of its first noble chief officer, at that time in Jerusalem, to be placed in co njunction with the initial of that famous class of workmen, who distinguish themselves in that branch of operative maso nry set apart for finishing the Porphyry materials. W. M. Where were you placed after your obligation ? P. M. After circumscribing the lodge by the Right Wor- shipful Master’s command from east to west, I was placed in a circle, in the centre, as a Past Master, to prove to all the "},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 250 brothers then present that I was eligible to act in future, in conjunction with them, to superintend the workmen up to this order inclusive. W. M. Why is our Lodge in this degree dedicated to the noble prince Adoniram ? P. M. Because he was next in rank to Hiram Abiff, and also Grand Superintendent over the levy of Jerusalem, and the first Right Worshipful Master who presided over the Master Masons at the memorable period of time. ———— A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF EXCELLENT MASONS. CATECHISM . W. M. How were you prepared as an Excellent Mason ? E. M. In the character of a Past Master of Arts and Sciences, and properly hoodwinked. W. M. Why were you hoodwinked in this degree ? E. M. It alludes to the darkness of the Jewish nation, prior to the delivery of the two tables of stone by the Almighty to Moses, which was to bring them to the light of those reli- gious and moral laws that were ever after to be the standard of their future lives and actions. W. M. What procured your admission ? E. M. Five distinct knocks, and the pass-word of a Master of Arts and Sciences. W. M. In what manner did you enter ? E. M. Upon the Trinity in Unity, figured out by five tri- angular points in geometry. W. M. Why were you introduced in that manner ? E. M. To denote that I was about to enter on the founda- tion of geometric Masonry, th e superstructure of which was the laws of that celestial Trinity which this instrument, on which I entered emblematically, represented. W. M. In what manner were you then dealt with ? E. M. I was conducted round the lodge in due form. W. M. What were you then ordered to do ? E. M. To advance by the same number of steps as I had then made in Masonry, accompanied with their respective positions. "},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 251 W. M. In what manner were you placed to receive your new obligation ? E. M. Upon both knees bare and bended, my right hand on the Holy Bible, and the left extending the passport of my admission. W. M. Why called passport of admission ? E. M. Because, if I had not previously proved myself qua- lified to perform those excellent branches of operative masonry, as a complete architect, in all it s beautiful designs of sculpture, painting, tapestry, and ornament s, I should not have been found eligible for the sublime secrets contained in this degree ; therefore, my left hand, extending this honourable emblem of admission, was to denote to the brethren present, that I was a fit candidate for this degree; and extending it in full view of all the brothers, was the last sign al for any of them to examine me, if they had any doubts of my pretentions or qualifications to become a member of this order. W. M. How did you confirm your obligation ? E. M. With my lips five times upon the Holy Bible. W. M. How were you raised ? E. M. By the grip of an Excellent Mason. W. M. Be pleased to advance in due form and give it. W. M. To what does it allude ? E. M. To the penalty of the obligation. W. M. Be pleased to give me the grand emblematic sign, and tell me to what it alludes. E. M. It alludes to that memorable event of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments upon the thrice famous Sinai, in the wilderness of Arabia. W. M. To what does this word allude ? E. M. To that grand period of time when the Almighty condescended to converse with Moses at the foot of mount Horeb, and gave him his commission to go to Pharaoh, and de- mand the liberation of the Jews from their Egyptian bondage. W. M. Being obligated and. initiated, where were you placed ? E. M. Behind the veil of the temple, where I was ordered to restore myself to light, which enabled me to find, by a most singular phenomenon, that I stood upon holy ground. W. M. With what were you invested ? E. M. With the distinguishing external of an Excellent "},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 252 Mason, to certify that I stood exalted by my merit above the degree of a Past Master of Arts and Sciences. W. M. With what is the Jewel of this degree ornamented ? E. M. A star with as many poi nts as will take in the initials of the conjunct words of this order in Masonry. W. M. What is the mark or signature of this degree ? E. M. The three peculiar initials of the Redeemer of mankind. W. M. What is the masonic allusion of these three ? E. M. The first alludes to th e strongest pillar of Solomon’s temple ; the second alludes to the grand architect of that tem- ple ; and the third to those Masons who performed the opera- tive part. W. H. Where did the ancient brethren of this order assem- ble during the period employed in building that famous reli- gious edifice ? E. M. On one of the famous adjacent mounts, since called Mount Sion ; but during the dedication of the temple, they assembled for divine worship in the third round of courts. W. M. What was the onginal number in this excellent de- gree ? E. M. Eighty-one masons, formed into nine lodges, with nine in each lodge. W. M. Why is this degree dedicnted to Moses ? E. M. Because he presides over that lodge where those two excellent Masons , Aholiab and Bezaleel, performed their pious work in the wilderness, agreeable to the injunctions of the Almighty, when they were ordered to prepare the furniture and other sacred utensils for the holy tabernacle, which was first set up in the wilderness during the forty years’ pilgri- mage, prior to their entrance into the promised land. ———— A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF SUPER-EXCELLENT MASONS. CATECHISM . W. M. How were you prepared as a super-excellent Ma- son ? S. M. I was habited as the High Priest, hoodwinked, and both feet slip-shod. "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 253 W. M. Why habited as a High Priest ? S. M. Because this part in Masonry constituted the most solemn part of the employ at Jerusalem, when King Solomon’s temple was erected : namely to su rvey all the sacred utensils and ornaments that were to adorn the inner part of the temple. The most solemn and religious du ties of mankind, in all ages and countries, have been appropriated to the priesthood ; and Aaron, the brother of Moses, be ing the first High Priest, by command of the Almighty, we p repare onr candidates in the habits of the High Priest in commemoration thereof. W. M. Why were you hoodwinked ? S. M. In commemoration of the custom of our predecessors the nine deputy grand masters, the founders of the degree, who met in the holy place, pr ior to the dedication of the temple, from which all natural light was totally excluded, and which only received the aid of th at remarkable artifidal light, the three great candles, which w ere kept continually burning ; therefore, in commemoration thereof, we are deprived of our natural light ; and the first ligh t we afterwards receive is the representation of these three famous great candles, or artificial lights, in this sacred place. W. M. Is there a second reason why you were hoodwinked ? S. M. Because, in the sanc tum sanctorum, or holy of holies, there was no other light than the supernatural. W. M. Why were you slip-shod ? S. M. Because that part of the temple, in which the brothers of this degree first assembled, was called the holy place, and being situated on holy ground, we were, for that purpose, slip-shod. W. M. Being thus prepared, what gained your admission ? S. M. Three distinct and three quick reports. W. M. In what manner did you enter ? S. M. Upon the six famous points of geometry. W. M. In what manner were you then dealt with ? S. M. I was conducted round the lodge in due form. W. M. What were you next ordered to do ? S. M.

Upon both knees, with my right hands upon the "},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 254 Holy Bible, and my left extended with the emblem of my ad- mission. W. M. Why was your left hand unemployed ? S. M. Because that emblem, being the double equilateral triangle, and containing six sides, denoted the six peculiar branches of the noblest office in the Temple that I was then called upon to fulfil, namely firs t, to survey the constitutional rolls previous to their being deposited in the famous archives of masonry ; second, the precious stone work ; third, the holy place ; fourth, the sanctum sanc torum ; fifth, the ark of the covenant ; and, lastly, all the other utensils, and these were emblematically pointed out by the double equilateral triangle.

To that part of the ob ligation where that peculiar loss of both the arms constitutes the penalty attached to any .voluntary breach thereof.

As a point is the sm allest portion of geometrical matter, and the circle the largest of any within the plane of its surface, I was thus placed, to re present that point ; as one of * I have not the form of this obligation.

S. M. Nine, formed into three lodges with three in each. W. M. Why is this degree dedicated to Aaron, the High Priest ? S. M. Because he was the first priest who presided over the first most excellent and sacred lo dge held in the Tabernacles in the wilderness of Arabia. So also were the brothers of this degree appointed by King Solomon, as super-excellent Masons, to survey all the sacred furniture and jewels of that glorious building, for the same pious purpose as those in the Taber- nacle of Moses. ———— A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF NINE ELECTED KNIGHTS, CALLED, BY FINCH, SUB- LIME KNIGHTS ELECTED. FORM OF THE LODGE . The chamber in which this chapter is held represents the apartment in Solomon’s palace . The hangings are red and white columns intermixed and strewed with flames. The mas- ter represents Solomon, King of Israel, and is styled the most sovereign . There is but one warden, who sits alone in the west, representing Stolkin, and is called the Inspector. All the rest of the brethren must be in black and placed in the south, as the lights are placed, eight close, and one at a dis- tance. When there is a receptio n, all the brethren, being in mourning, sit with their hats flapped, and the right leg over "},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 256 the left, their heads leaning on their right hands, in a doleful character. Their aprons are lined and bordered with black. They wear a broad black ribbon from their left shoulder to their right hip, on the breast of which are painted three heads of fear and terror. A poniard hangs to this ribbon, with nine red roses painted on it near the bottom, four on each side, and one in the centre. Each broth er has a naked poniard lying at his feet. The plan of the draft of the lodge or chapter is an oblong square, at the upper part of which, to the right, is drawn the city of Jerusalem. At the left is represented a cave near the sea-side, and the riv er Joppa, surrounded with rocks, in which a man is seen, lying wi th his head on a rock, a lamp burning by him, a poniard at his feet, a running stream of water, and a cup. Over the moun tain the setting sun is seen. In the middle of the dr:aft appears a bush, which seems to be on fire, occasioned by the reflect ion of a rainbow. A brilliant star is fixed immediately over the cave to point out the re- treat of the murderer. On the dr aft is likewise seen a wind- ing road which leads from Jentsalem to Joppa. On this road a dog is seen near to the cave , which is the figure under which the unknown person is drawn. A man closely follows, and, at a distance, are seen eight oth er men walking without order. Near the room where this chapter is held there must be a small room made to represent a cave, and a large stone in it for the candidate to sit upon, a li ttle table with a lamp lighted, and, under it, the word REVENGE written. A poniard lies on the table, a spring or fountain runs in the room, a cup to drink out of, and an effigy of a man asleep. In this chapter, the sovereign sits under a canopy, in an ele- vated chair of state covered with black. Before him stands a table covered with black and a grey coloured carpet, on which is a bible, a sceptre, and a da gger. Solomon strikes with his sceptre, and Stolkin strikes with his poniard, which he holds in his hand as a symbol of revenge. FORM OF OPENING . Q. Are you an elected Knight ? A. One cavern received me, on e lamp gave me light, and one spring refreshed me. Q. What is the clock ? A. Break of day.

The master of the ceremonies br ings the candidate to the door, knocks eight and one, wh ich are repeated by the Mas- ter, all the brethren being in their proper postures. The Inspector rises and receives the candidate, whom he brings into the middle of the chamber, opposite to the Thrice Puis- sant. After a little silence, he is asked by the Master:— What do you want here ? A. I am come to solicit the favour of being initiated into the degree of the Nine Elected Knights. Q. What motives induce you to think that you deserve to have the honour conferred upon you ? A. My zeal, fervour, and co nstancy, which I promise shall be doubled hereafter, have made me aspire to this favour. T. P. M. Learn, my brother, that you are to impute your present admission into this chapter, less to a desire in us to confer this degree upon you, than to an inclination to make a trial of your conduct and courage, and of your com- pliance with the obligations wh ich you have contracted in the different degrees through which you have already passed. Know, my brother, that, at this moment, we have in our power one of the murderers of our respectable Master, Hiram Abiff, who groans under the enormity of his guilt and expects every instant to undergo the rigorous torture which his crimes justly merit, to serve as an example to deter others. This I have learnt from a stranger, who will conduct those I send to the place where the miscreant is hidden. My dear brother, this chapter is fully convinced of your zeal, and is much disposed to confer higher degrees on you. So, now the opportunity offers of your being the first to re- venge the craft, by bringing th is villain to condign punish- ment, if possible, adequate to the enormity of his crimes.—Do you find yourself disposed to vindicate the royal art, and to sacrifice the traitor, in honour of masonry ?—Give me an answer. A. I shall be happy of the opportunity to :cevenge the death of our dear Grand Master. "},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 258 T. P. M. I must previously inform you that this man is, perhaps, one of your acquaintan ces, probably your friend, or your brother ; but in such a case as this every sentiment must give way to that of revenge, whic h, with you, is to stifle every other consideration, because no bad consequences will attend your accomp'lishment of th is revenge. Besides, this is the only opportunIty that offers of making us sensible of your zeal, by which you will be admitted in.to this degree; there- fore, determine immediately. A. I am determined. T. P. M. Suffer yourself to be conducted, and follow the stranger to the place where the criminal is hidden. The candidate is now blindfolded and conducted to the cave, where he is seated on a stone, opposite to the sleeping mur- derer. When seated, the guide te Ils him that he shall have to leave him for a while ; another brother shakes a parcel of chains and groans heavily. The guide places the candidate’s left hand on the table, tells hi m to lay his head on his arm, and his right hand on his thigh; and thus addresses him :— My dear brother, I must leave you a little while, be of good courage, and not daunted. Promise me faithfully that you will remain in the posture in which I now leave you, however much alarmed you may be by any noise which you may hear. Attend to what I say ; for, if yo u neglect it, your life may be the cost. As soon as you he ar a masonic knock, take the bandage from your eyes, and closely examine every object that is around you. When yo u hear a second knock drink out of the cup, which you will find near your left hand. When you hear a third knocking you must do exactly as a voice shall bid you. Although I leav e you alone, believe me, the eyes of the whole chapter are upon you ; therefore, I beg that you will not fail to comply with these instructions. Farewell, I leave you. He quits the room, and shuts the door sharply after him. In a minute or two he knocks three distinct, knocks ; after a while he knocks again, as before; and then again, when a voice tells the ca ndidate to take that dagger and strike the villain, first on the he ad, then in his heart. Cut off the head and follow me with it in your left hand, and the dagger in the right. He is ag ain brought to the door of the lodge, and knocks eight and one. The door being opened, the Master says—Who comes there ? "},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 259 A. Joabert, who has discovered where the traitor was con- cealed, and having revenged the death of our respectable Mas- ter, Hiram Abiff, comes to lay th e villain’s head at the feet of Solomon, King of Israel. He is then admitted. Holding th e head out, he strikes at it with the dagger, which brings to the throne, where he falls on his knees, with the head and dagger exposed in his hands. The king, seeing the ca ndidate, rises with great indig- nation, and says :—Wretch ! what have you done ? My orders were, that the traitor should be taken and brought to me, not that you should put him to death. Your disobedience of orders shall, therefore, cost you your life . Stolkin, put him to death. (On hearing this the brethren fall on one knee, and beg pardon from Solomon for the candidate, saying, that it was an excess of zeal and love for the memory of our respected Master, Hiram Abiff, that prompted him to disobey the King’s orders. While this entreaty is making, Stolkin seizes the candidate, and stands ready to execute his orders. Solomon says stop :— My Brother Joabert, I freely forgiv e you, the second time, as you meant no wrong, but beware of the third offence.—The head and poniard are then taken from him, and the obligation is administered.) The penalty of this obligation embraces all those of the foregoing, with a promise to revenge masonry in, general ; to protect the order of one’s own brethren with all one’s might and power ; to submit one’s self to perish br the same weapon which will be given as an honourab le mark of this order, and as a reward for zeal and constancy. The Thrice Puissant raises th e candidate and gives him the dagger, saying :—I deliver you this vindictive weapon: make a good use of it when required. The first sign of this order is for one to take a poniard or sword and stab another on the forehead. The one that is struck claps his hand to his forehead to see if it is bloody. The second sign is to strike your poniard to the heart of another, and say Necum. The other answers by laying his hand upon his heart, and saying—Joabert. The grip is to take the thumb of the other's right hand, and in the bottom of yours, clench all the fingers of both hand, and place the thumb erect. It signifies the elect eight close and one by itself. "},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 260 The pass-words are Necum, Joabert, and Stolkin. The grand word is Begulgal , signifying faithful guardian, chief of the Tabernacle, friend and chosen favourite. The candidate is led to the seat, the brethren resume their proper attitudes, and the Thrice Puissant delivers the fol- lowing DISCOURSE . Thrice respectable brother elect, the unanimity and earnest- ness with which this respectable assembly require your pardon, disposed my heart to grant it, especially as your crime was only an overflow of zeal. In th is you have imitated Joabert, the favourite of Solomon, King of Israel, as I am about to relate. You doubtless recollect the lamentable catastrophe of our respectable Master, Hiram Abiff. His death is the con- stant subject of our griefs and tears, and, in this, we imitate the wisest of kings, who bemoaned the irreparable loss which he had sustained. You know that Solomon, on hearing that he was missing, put a stop to th e building, and swore that no person should be paid his wage s, until this great man was found dead or alive. You also recollect that the brethren went in search of him, and that Stol kin, at length, found him assas- sinated, and buried under or near a sprig of cassia. Stolkin’s good luck, on this melancholy occasion, endeared him to the king, and procured. him his g reatest confidence. Nor was Solomon contented with having the funeral obsequies of that great man celebrated with as much splendour and maganifi- cence as possible ; but was also determined to take public satisfaction on the perpetrators of that horrid crime, and to sacrifice them to the manes of his deceased friend. He issued a proclamation, offering a rewar d to any person who would give information where the villa ins were concealed ; and that he would even forgive the real a ssassin if he would come into his presence, acknowledge his guilt, and give up his accom- plices, so that they might suffer condign punishment for the ex- piation of the greatest of crimes . This proclamation was long out to no purpose. But one day, when Solomon was sitting in his hall, giving audience to more than ninety masters and other officers of the order, Jerbel, Captain of the Guards, en- tered and informed him that an unknown person wanted to speak to him in private, as he had a matter of high importance "},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 261 to impart. The brethren were alarmed at the readiness with which the king consented to a pr ivate audience from fear of danger to his person ; but the audience being short, a speedy return removed those fears. He informed them, this unknown person was acquainted with the retreat of the murderers of Hiram Abiff, and had offered to accompany such people as would accompany him and inform themselves of the truth of what he asserted. The brethren , to a man, immediately stood up and offered their services on that occasion. The king was highly pleased at their zeal, but declared, that among such a number of virtuous brethren, they who should be employed in the honour of taking these victims of vengeance should be deter- mined by lot. The names of the Intendants of the Buildings who were present were put in a b ox, when the king declared the nine whose names should be first drawn should follow the unknown stranger and bring the traitors alive, to be made an example to the latest posterity. Lots were accordingly drawn, and joy gladdened the faces of those whose names came out. These received instructions from the king to follow the un- known man, who would conduct them to the cave which was the retreat of the traitors. They departed, but one of the nine, Joabert, whom you this day represent, animated with uncom- mon ardour, and thinking his br ethren walked too slow, got before them, and was the first th at came to the cave, which was situated near the sea-side, not far from Joppa. Near it was a bush, which seemed to burn ; and a star, which had conducted them, stood fixed over the cave. Joabert, inflamed with rage, entered, and by the ai d of a lamp which was burning, saw the villain asleep lying on hi s back. A dagger lay at his feet, which Joabert seized and struck wi th all his might, first on the head, and then in the heart. Th e villain sprang up with fury ; but, immediately dropped dead at his feet, and pronounced the word Necum. Joabert cut off hi s head, and then quenched his thirst at the spring in the cave, when he was joined by his brethren, whom he was just goin g to meet. They, seeing the head of the villain, represented to Joabert that he had com- mitted a fault by his zeal, and th at thus putting an end to the villain’s life, he had rescued him from the tortures which Solo- mon had prepared for him. Th ey promised to intercede and use their influence with the king to procure his pardon. All quenching their thirst, Joabert ta king the head, they walked "},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 262 back to Jerusalem. On seeing them Solomon was about to give orders for the intended tortures ; but, espying the villain’s head in the hands of Joabert, he could not restrain his wrath, and ordered Stolkin to put him to death. This would have been instantly executed had not all the brethren thrown them- selves on their knees and begged him off, as the illustrious brethren of this chapter have done for you. From the histori- cal circumstances related you may see what useful instruction can be drawn. First, by the trai tor’s death, you see that crimes never go unpunished ; but that, sooner or later, they meet their deserts. Secondly, you ma y learn from Joabert’s danger, how unsafe it is to exceed orders ; and that it is a necessary duty strictly to comply with the orders of your superiors. Thirdly, by the pardon procured for this zealous brother, you may learn, how easily the heart of a good king is influenced to be merciful. You also see how ne cessary it is to have friends who will interest themselves warmly for us on critical occa- sions. And now, my dear broth er, we will put an end to this discourse by applause your reception with eight and one. CATECHISM . Q. Brother, are you a master elect ? A.

"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 264 Q. How did the elect walk ? A. Darkness obliged them to put their hands before their heads, to prevent injury, by. coming against an obstruction. And, as the road was bad and uneven, they were obliged to cross their legs, and, for that reason, we sit in that position in the chapter. Q. What does the dog repres ent, which you see in the draft ?

( The brethren make the sign with their daggers, first striking the head and then the heart. Solomon strikes 8 and 1 : Stolkin does the same : and the chapter is closed .) ———— BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ELECT OF NINE. This lodge represents the cabinet .of Solomon. It is lighted with nine lights. Two arm chairs are placed in the east. As the lodge is called the council of nine, it cannot be held unless that number of brethren be pres ent. Two kings are supposed to be included, and are seated in the centre, and the other members of the lodge surround the infant. One of the kings has a dagger in his hand; the other a sceptre. Emblems of mortality are displayed on the clothing, and the words conquer "},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 266 or die are conspicuous round the room. The names by which the kings are distinguished, is, Solomon, the most wise , and Hiram the most powerful . FORM OF OPENING . M. W. Most powerful king, what is your motive in assist- ing at our present council ? M. P. Most wise king, I atte nd your deliberations to de- mand justice. A murder has been committed, and the injury has been unredressed. Punishme nt must follow, and vengeance will be satisfied. M. W. Most powerful king, you shall be witness to the in- quiry that shall be instituted in order to detect the assassin, and it will remain for you, if we are successful, to determine the punishment. Placing the scep tre on the head of a brother, he says—I appoint you, most respectable brother, Intimate Secretary. You are to watch for the safety of the council ; assure yourself of the qualifications of the members present. ( The Intimate Secretary salutes the kings, and having taken the sign, token, and word from, the others, reports, that all pre- sent are faithful subjects .) M. W. My brethren, whom the Creator has enlightened, whom equity directs and truth guides, I pronounce that the council is resumed. Intimate Secretary, the profane are ex- cluded, and, under this name, we comprehend Masons, who are honoured with the title of Master Elect. Place a guard without the door, let the avenues be searched, and return quickly with your report. I. S. Most wise king, all is covered. The guards environ the door of the palace, and our mysteries are secure from the penetration of the world. The Master strikes seven equal knocks and two quick, say- ing Necum Nicum, which signifies vengeance. M. W. Brethren, you have wi tnessed the grief I experienced on a lamentable occasion. In va in have I dictated steps to be taken, as a prelude to a discovery. Each of us is inter- ested to revenge our loss. My royal brother is come hither to demand it. To him, therefore, I will refer you. He will in- spire you with sentiments wort hy of the cause which he un- dertakes, and you will now attend to its recital. After a silence, "},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 267 the most powerful king draws hi s dagger, and pointing it to- wards the infant, thus addresses the lodge :— The pledge is before us, which this great man has left. This will soften and stimulate you to vi rtuous deeds. If his memory be dear to you, the cries of this child, his tears and his prayers, will move your compassions. He asks vengeance for the loss of his parent, who was your comp anion and your friend. Unite, therefore, your efforts to discover the inhuman wretch, that he may meet his reward. The lodge exclaims, Necum Nicum. The master in collecting these votes is interrupted by a noise at the door, and says, In timate Brother, who occasions this, and how are my orders obeyed ? The brother retires and immediately returns to report that the council is betrayed. The lodge unanimously reports Ne- cum Nicum. The master adds :— The sceptre is raised, our in- dignation must yield to the necessity of hearing the particulars of the report. Tell us, Intimate Secretary, who has caused this interruption, and who has th e audacity to penetrate to the august council. I. S. I behold, with surprise, that a brother has clandes- tinely entered the adjacent ap artment, and I am apprehen- sive that he has heard the secret s of the council. It is with horror, I relate, that he appears to be guilty of murder. His hands and his sword are stained with blood. Every particular testifies against him, and all unite to excite my suspicion. M. W. He shall be satisfied. The other king deliberates and says :—My brother, attend to your usual wisdom, and be not too rash. Let the wretch be disarmed, bound, and introduced, and let him reply to the in- terrogations that shall be put to him. This degree appears to be but an other version of that of In- timate Secretary, or Joabert’s second slip. The sign is made by drawing two daggers with the right hand, and lifting it as if to strike in the front. The a nswer to it is, to shut the right hand, and the fist thus closed, is raised and turned quick. The token for him who asks is delivered, by erecting his thumb, while his right hand is closed, and presenting it to his com- panion. The answer is to seiz e the thumb with an extended arm. The word is Necum Nicum."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 268 SECOND ELECT OF NINE, OR PEREGNON. The decorations are the same as in the foregoing degree, and it only differs by being lighted with twenty-seven lamps, dis- posed in groups of nine. The lodge is opened by the master’s asking, if there are any other my steries in quality of Master Elect, than those of Necum Nicu m. He is answered, that the appendage of the letter P is another mystery. The words of this degree are Romvel Gravelot, Abiram. The ceremony concludes with telling the candidate, that the business of this degree is to prepare him for another, which is the THIRD ELECT, OR ELECT OF FIFTEEN. This lodge is hung with black and decorated with three ske- letons. It is opened with fifteen strokes, and ligrted with fif- teen lamps. At a reception, only fifteen brethren are permitted to be present. The sign is to shut the right hand with the thumb elevated, as in holding a dagger, to place it under the chin, and then drop it, as in the act of separating the body, in- dicative of the penalty of the obligation. It is answered by stretching out the hand, as if to cut off the neck with the thumb. —The token is to give little strokes of the forefinger upon the joint of the little finger. It is answered by taking the right hand, with the fingers of the right hand extended, and shaking it thrice, which signifies three times five, the number of the fifteen elect.—The word is Zeomet, and the answer to it Elcham.* ———— A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF THE PRIESTLY ORDER OF ISRAEL, OR PROVOST AND JUDGE. This lodge is held in Solomon’ s private arch, under the sanc- tum sanctorum, and over the sepulchre of Hiram Abiff, in which place he was finally installed with his jewel. * I have no further particulars of th e last two degrees than those stated."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 269 The officers are twelve ; Tito Zadok, the High Priest ; King Solomon ; Hiram, King of Tyre, with nine grand officers. The two kings are under the High Priest. The first of the nine grand officers is called Senior Provost. The lodge is hung with red, and illuminated with twelve great lights in the form of a triangle.. The High Priest sits under a rich blue canopy, ornamented with purple, scarlet and gold, the four famous colours that adorned the veil of King Solomon’s Temple and the Taber- nacle in the wilderness, under Moses, the great and inspired lawgiver. Tito Zadok, in addition to th e office of High Priest, bears that of Prince of Jerusalem and Harodim. Solomon and Hi- ram are styled royal chiefs. Th ese three officers have each a sceptre in his hand. The two kings wear crowns, and the High Priest the regular habit of the office. The candidate for this degree, having been admitted and obligated, is thus addressed by the High Priest. Brother N——, you having take n the solemn obligation of this degree, I do, in virtue of the power to me given, consti- tute and appoint you a Provost and Judge, with the title of High Priest of Jerusalem and Harodim, and Grand Superin- tendent over the Architects of the Temple, in the place of your late Grand Master, Hiram Abiff. And we do here in- vest you with these four golden keys, suspended to this red ribbon, and with this apron boun d with the same colour, as an emblem of the ardour and zeal of Hiram Abiff. The first of these keys will open the private arch of King Solomon. The second will let you into the tomb of the immortal widow’s son. The third will let you into the sanctum sanctorum, or holy of holies. And the other will enable you to find the sacred treasure in the ark of the covenant. CATECHISM . Q. What is denoted by Tito Zadok ? A. Tito Zadok, the Prince and High Priest of Jerusalem. Q. What means the second name ? A. It denotes the High Priest to be just. Q. What was the intention of King Solomon in forming this degree ? "},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 270 A. To appoint grand superintendents over the architects to carry into execution the plans of Hiram Abiff in the outer works of the Temple, and to ho nour the great servant of the most high lord, who was, for th at purpose, created Prince of Harodim and Jerusalem, set above the great and learned King of Tyre, and the most powerful king then on earth, whose wisdom far exceeded that of all men. This High Priest was the first admitted by these two kings into this degree, and within the holy place of the temple. Q. Who was the second Mason exalted to this degree ? A. Zadok, the great favourite of King Solomon, and to him was entrusted the four keys of the sacred treasures contained in the oracle, above it in the ob elisk of Hiram Abiff, and below it in the sacred private arch of Solomon. Q. In what manner did Zadok obtain admission into these sacred places ? A. Into the obelisk he had free access without attendance. Into the sanctum sanctorum, or holy of holies, only with the permission and in the presence of Tito Zadok, the High Priest, who opened with the second key of the door the holy place leading to the sanctum sanctorum, and having the glorious veil of the temple, whic h separated the holy place from the most holy sanctum sanctorum, thrown aside by twelve of the priesthood, representing the tw elve tribes of Israel, he was permitted, during the reading of the law by the Senior Priest of the tribes of Israel, to view that glorious treasure exhibited in due form by the High Priest. Into Solomon’s private arch he entered, accompanied by Solo mon himself and Hiram, King of Tyre, while the nine grand o fficers guarded the nine arches that led from the residence of the king on Mount Sion to the arch under the holy Mount Moriah. And with his fourth key he entered the sepulchre of Hiram Abiff, under the arch of Solomon, and, on that solemn and secret spot, he took the great obligation of this degree, in the presence of the kings of Jerusalem and Tyre. Q. What was the result of th e initiation of Zadok the High Priest into this degree ? A. He was so struck with admiration, in beholding the fur- niture of this holy place, in the bowels of the earth, that he fell prostrate, and pronounced J——. Q. What does that denote ? "},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 271 A. The glorious light of God. King Solomon perceived him in that attitude, at the instant the words were pronoun- ced advanced and raised him exclaiming, J———az—b. Q. What does that denote ? A. The sight of God. Solo mon delivered to him the four keys belonging to this degree, by which his knowledge was daily increased. Q. What else was to be seen in that sacred lodge ? A. A triangle in the middle of the circle, and in centre of it the T T two crosses, like the cross of mount Calvary. Q. What is denoted by the two roses ? A. The white rose represents the purity and innocence of Hiram Abiff ; and the red, on the circle stone, his blood open for the honourable cause of Masonry. FORM OF CLOSING . High Priest. Companions and explorers of the bowels of the earth, be pleased to assist me in closing the lodge of Judges of the holy city of Jerusalem. Pray, Senior Companion, what is the last duty ? Senior Provost. To seal the sepulchre of our departed grand master, lock up our secrets, and retire in peace from the man- sion of the dead.. H. P. Take the emblems of your office, and see that duty faithfully performed. The Senior Companion receives from the two kings their seals—the one with the arms of Jerusalem, the other with the rod of Aaron budding—with which he closes the tomb, and seals the sepulchre of Hiram Abiff. The High Priest does the sa me with the seal which repre- sents the arms of the twelve tribes. Each joins the proper report as pointed out, and the lodge is closed. ———— A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF PROVOST AND JUDGE, OR IRISH MASTER. FORM OF THE LODGE . This lodge is hung with red, and illuminated with five great lights ; one of which must be in the centre, and the others at "},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 272 the four angles. The master is placed in the east, under a blue canopy bespangled with golden stars. The master’s title is that of thrice illustrious and puissant . He represents Tito Prince Harodim, the eldest of the Provost and Judges, first grand warden and inspector of the three hundred architects, who drew plans for the workmen of the temple. The second senior master acts as senior wa rden, and the brethren are to be placed to the right and left according to seniority. The wardens, sit in the west. FORM OF OPENING . The thrice illustrious and puissant master strikes four quick and one slow, which is repeated by the warden. The master asks the following questions :— Q. Illustrious brother warden, are we tiled ? A. Thrice iIlustrio:us and puissant master we are tiled and can begin to work. Q. Where stands your master ? A. Everywhere, thrice illustrous master. Q. Why so ? A. To supervise the conduct of the workmen, to attend to the business done by them, and to render impartial justice to each of them. Q. What is the clock ? A. It is break of day, eigh t o’clock, two o’clock, seven o’clock. The master strikes four and one on the altar, which is re- ported by the wardens. The mast er says :—As it is eight, two and seven o'clock, it is time for the workmen to begin their work. The lodge is opened, and the brethren clap four and one. FORM OF RECEPTION . The master holds a sceptre in his hand, and orders the grand master of the ceremonies to go an d prepare the candidate. He goes, brings him to the door, and knocks as before, which the warden repeats, and after him th e master. The warden informs the master that somebody knocks as Provost and Judge. The master sends to inquire who is there, which being done, the answer returned is, Brother N —— stands at the door, and solicits the favour of being admitted to the degree of Illustrious "},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 273 Master Provost and Judge . The master desires the candidate to be examined and admitted. The master of the ceremonies introduces him, places him betw een the wardens, and retires. The senior warden takes the ca ndidate by the hand, makes him kneel, and pronounce C IVI , and lays his naked hand on his shoulder. Thus he remains awhile, until the thrice illustrious and puissant master pronounces the word Ky. Then the junior warden raises him, and leads him seven times round the lodge. At the first round he gives the Apprentice’s sign, and every other in rotation as he go es round. He is now brought to the foot-stool of the throne, and thus addressed by the master :— Respectable brother, it gives me pleasure to have it in my power to reward. your zeal for ma sonry, and your attention and attachment to the master of mast ers. This I do by appointing you Provost and Judge over all th e workmen of this lodge ; for as we are fully convinced of your discretion, we do not scruple to confide in you, and to communicate our most important secrets to your bosom, which will encourage you to do your duty in this degree, as you have done in the former, to which you had the honour of being admi tted.

The origin of this degree is deduced from the tower of Babel, or from a son of Noah. The officers are: 1st, A Grand Commander. 2nd, A Knight of Introduction. "},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 277 3rd, A Knight of Eloquence. 4th, A Knight of Finances. 5th, A Knight of Chancery, and 6th, A Knight of Defence. The members are denominated Knights or Prussion Masons. The mysteries for the initiation a re only to be celebrated when the moon is at its full. None to be admitted but Masons. At the time of the Crusades the Knights of the various nations were confederated in Palestine, and mutually communicated their secrets in Masonry. The Prussian Knights initiated the Christian Princes and their attendants who were Masons. The apartment in which the reception takes place must not be in a confined situation, as the only light permitted is from the moon. The members of this degree wear their swords, aprons, and gloves, trimmed with yellow, and their jewels pen- dant by a black ribbon to a bu tton of their waistcoats. The form is triangular, and an arrow with its point towards the earth is the symbol. The members should be ranged on each side forming an avenue ; the Grand Commander in front facing the moon. The chapter is opened by the G. C. striking thrice with the blade of the sword, and returning it to the scabbard. He then raises his hand towards the moon , the brethren doing, the same, and, in this posture, declares th at the chapter is lighted. The Knights examine the drawing until the candidate is properly prepared for introduction. He is to be uncovered, without a sword, and to wear a white apro n and gloves. The drawing is to be divided into two apartments: the ground of one is blue, a silver moon and golden stars are to be depicted on it ; the other is black, with a triangle and a golden arrow delineated. The Knight of Introduction, who precedes the candidate, strikes thrice ; and the Knight of Defence, whose department is to take care of the avenues, announces him by one on the inside, opens the door, and demand s the secret of the order, which is delivered and reported to the Grand Commander ; who replies :—The Worthy Knight is at liberty to enter, if he be alone ; but if accompanied it remains for him to be ac- quainted with the motives that induce his companion to wish for admittance. This is answered, that it is a master who is desirous of being admitted a Prussian Mason. G. C. Let him enter and be examined. "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 278 The Knights draw their swords, and present the points to the candidate. G. C. I declare, brave Knights, that he is worthy of your countenance. Give me your assent [which is done]. Brother N——, will you renounce pride all the days of your life ? Candidate. I promise so to do. G. C. Example is far superior to precept ; commence your career with an act of humility. The candidate is led to the feet of the Grand Commander, by three reverences on his left knee, and being prostrate before him, is commanded to kiss the pommel of his sword. Before he is permitted to rise the Knight of Eloquence addresses him on the subject of vanity, and dr aws his conclusions on the evil consequences attending it from the example of Peleg and Solomon. G. C. Do you promise upon the faith of a Mason, to keep the secrets with which I shall entrust you, on the conditions —first, that you will never reveal to any of the children of Adam the mysteries of our order ; second, that you will as- sociate with us in future ; third, that you will never suffer at the peril of your life any man to wear the Jewel of this order, unless he makes himself known to you as a Prussian Mason ? Candidate. I engage myself to fulfil the prescribed conditions. G. C. Knight of Eloquence you are at liberty to make known the history of our excellent order. K. E. To every Prussian Mason be it known notwithstand- ing the recent vengeance whic h the Deity had taken upon mankind for their iniquities, by causing universal deluge— notwithstanding the Deity had gi ven the rainbow as a sign of reconciliation, vouchsafing that favour declared that the world should not be again destroyed by waters, the descendants of Noah, from their want of faith in the divine prediction, being apprehensive of a second deluge, said,—Let us build a city whose top may reach the heavens, and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth. To accom- plish their designs, they began to erect a high tower in the plain of Shinar ; but this enterprise being displeasing in the eyes of their Maker, as tending to fr ustrate or delay the execution of his design, that mankind should not always continue toge- ther, he obliged them to discontinue the project, by confound- "},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 279 ing their language, so that one could not understand another. From this circumstance the city took its name of Babel, which signifies confusion ; and a dispersion of the people and a planting of nations ensued. It was on the night of the full moon that the Lord worked this wonder, in remembrance of which, the Noahites hold their lodges at this season. The architect was named Peleg ; at least, it was he who gave the idea of this building. As a punishment for his contumacy, and the presumption of his bret hren, he was deprived of hir speech ; and to avoid the outrages of his companions, who con- sidered him as the cause of the failure of their design, he tra- velled into countries remote from Shinar, and from thence only by moonlight, as he was fe arful of massacre if his person were recognised. His place of retirement was Prussia, where having erected a triangular dwelli ng, he, by humiliation, and contrition for the part he had taken in the plain of Shinar, obtained remission for his sins, and had his speech restored to him. This dwelling of Peleg’s was discovered fifteen cubits deep from the surface of the earth, in the year 553. In it was found a stone of white marble, on which was inscribed the particulars I have related in the Hebrew tongue, and, adja- cent was the following epitaph :—Here repose the ashes of the grand architect of the tower of Babel. The Lord had pity on him because he became humble. Thus we communicate our grand secret to you, unknown to every one but ourselves. We tr ust it to you with pleasure. Misfortune to you, if you are weak enough to transcribe it. Be circumspect, and for that purpose practise humility, after the example of our grand architect. The knights sheath their swords, and the candidate is in- vested with his. The Jewel is tied to the button of his waist- coat. His apron and gloves a re decorated with yellow bor- ders, and he is entrusted with the sign, grip, word, and pass- word. The ceremony is concluded by th e G. C.’s observing, that the lodge is obscured, and that it is time to retire. A table lighted with candles is introduc ed, and, if a supper be pro- vided it is to consist wholly of vegetables. CATECHISM . Q. Who are you ? "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 280 A. Tell me who you are, and I will tell you who I am. Q. Do you know the children of Noah ? A.

A. The initial letter of the secret word. Q. Present the signs. A. The arms extended toward s the moon ; and the face to- wards the east. Q. Why is the face towards the east ? A.

I have mentioned him. Q. Who acquainted you with his history ? A. The Knight of Eloquence. Q. In what lodge ? A. In a lodge where the moon gave light. Q. Was this edifice praiseworthy ? A. It was not, as it was never completed. Q. What is the reason to be assigned ? A. The foundation was laid in pride. Q. Is it to imitate the children of Noah that you retain it in your memory ? A. No ; but to avoid the danger which they experienced.. Q. Where were the remains of Peleg deposited ? A. In a tomb. Q. Was he not consideted a reprobate ? A. No. The stone on his remai ns inform us that his Creator had mercy on him on account of his subsequent humility. Q. In what manner were you received a Prussian Mason ? A. By three humiliations ; and by kissing the pommel of the sword of the Grand Commander. "},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 281 Q. Why did you submit to these humiliations ? A. As a proof of my obedienc e to the dictates enjoined in this degree. Q. Why do knights wear a triangle ? A. In memory of the temple of Peleg. Q. Why is the arrow reserved in the centre of it ? A. In remembrance of the remission that took place from his contrition, and that the cup of wrath was turned away from him. G. C. So may it be turned aside from all his successors, and with this sentiment I close the lodge of Noahites. ———— A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF RED CROSS SWORD OF BABYLON. FIRST POINT . Officers—Cyrus, Mithredath, Se nior Prince, Junior Prince, Senior General, Junior Genera l, Eastern Knight, Southern Knight. Scene—Babylon with two towers, and a bridge over the river Euphrates. Cyrus is called, most potent sire . For the solemnities of this order, two apartments are re- quired. One is considered as the council chamber of Cyrus, King of Persia and Babylon. A throne is placed in the east, and behind it a transparency, descriptive of a dream of that monarch, lighted with. seventy lamps, to represent seventy years of the captivity of the Jews. FORM OF OPENING . Cyrus—Brother companions, assist me to open this sove- reign chapter of Knights of the Red Cross Sword of Babylon. Princes, Generals, the days of the seventy years for the cap- tivity of the Jews are expired. My intention is to liberate them, and to that purpose, I will relate to you the particulars of a dream. Interpret. the word s, and assist me with your counsel. In my sleep, I perceived a lion ready to devour me, and at a distance, Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar, my predecessors, "},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 282 in chains. They were contemplating a GLORY , which masons show as the name of the Grand Architect of the Universe. In the clouds appeared an eag le, from whose beak issued an order to RENDER LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES ; I was astonished and confounded. The dream vanished, but my tranquillity is disturbed. Princes deliberate ; assent or dissent to the term of vision. They draw their swords, and present their points to the air, then to the earth ; by which they assent to the will of the king. Then they lift up the points, which denotes liberty , and let them remain in that position. Cyrus. Brother companions, the captivity shall be conclu- ded. Princes, Generals, the Chapter of Knights of the Red Cross Sword of Babylon is opened. FORM OF RECEPTION . The candidate, being properly prepared, is brought to the door of the outer tower of Cyrus’s palace, and gives the proper report. One of the king’s guar ds of that tower opens the door, and demands, who comes there ? Zerubbabel. The first among my equals, a Mason of rank, and a royal captive in Babylon. Guard. What is your desire ? Z. To approach the presence of our sovereign. G. What is your name ? Z. That is well known. No t one in Babylon but that knows my name and dignity. [Here Zerubbabel throws aside his outer garment, and dis- covers the rich dress that he usually wore at the court of Cy- rus, by which with his well-known features, he makes himself known to the guard.] G. What is your age ? Z. Seventy years. G. What is the nature of your present application ? Z. To remedy the miserable situation of my brethren. G. Attend, whilst I report you to the king and council. Here the guard knocks, as a Knig ht of the Red Cross Sword, seven distinct or slow, three quick, an interval, and two quick. Answered from within, he reports, that the Prince Zernbbabel solicits an audience of the king. He is commanded, after a pause, to introduce him to th e middle tower. The Senior "},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 283 Prince of the court of Babylon, who now represents Cyrus, the king, comes to him and says :— Worthy Prince, for what do you appear before us ? Z. I implore your good will and justice. S. P. Upon whose account ? Z. My own, and that of my companions, who have been in servitude seventy years. S. P. Signify the extent of the favour you request. Z. To grant us our liberty, to permit us to return to Judea, and to assist us in rebuilding the temple of our Creator. S. P. Since motives so just and honourable have brought you here, you shall speak to us face to face. The council chamber door is th rown open, and, upon enter- ing, Zerubbabel kneels before the th rone of Cyrus. The king’s representative, during the time of his kneeling, delivers the substance of the request. Cyrus says :—Arise, worthy prince, I have long witnessed the weight of your captivity, and am ready to release you this instan t, if you will communicate to me the mysteries of your order of Masonry ; for which I have always had the most profound veneration. Z. Most potent Sire, your situation renders it impossible for me to entrust you with them ; for Solomon, when he first gave us the principles, taught us that equality , fidelity , and brotherly love , were ever to be the criterion among Masons. Your rank, your titles, your sup eriority, are incompatible with the mansions where the sacred my steries of our order are pre- valent. Our exterior marks are unknown to you. My engage- ments with my brethren are inviolable, and I dare not reveal to you our secrets . If my liberty is only to be purchased in this manner, I prefer captivity. Cyrus. I admire your zeal and your courage. Princes, generals, this worthy prince meri ts liberty for bis attachment to his solemn compact. ( The brethren assent by lowering the points of their swords .) With much pleasure, I grnnt the re- mission you requested, ancl consent to your liberty. ( The chains are removed frum the captive .) Go into your country of Judea. I permit you to reb uild the temple of Jerusalem, destroyed by my predecessors ; and your treasure shall be returned you before the sun is se t. I appoint you chief among your brethren, and to preside over your equals ; and I com- mand that they shall honour you as they have hitherto me. "},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 284 I expect a small tribute from you, and will send to receive it even under the porches of your new temple as soon as erected. I ask a model of your temple. It is not for the single value that I require it ; but to convince your neighbours and sur- rounding nations, that you are still under my protection. Henceforward, you are to be to me, and I will be to you, a friend. I now arm you with this sword as a distinguishing mark above vour fellow companio ns. You are to consider it the same sword that Nebuchadnezzar received from your king, Jehoiechim, at the time of his captivity ; and I am persuaded, that you will employ it in the defence of your country, religion, and laws. I, therefore, create you a Knight of the Red Cross Sword, and, as a proof of my esteem, I invest you with this apron and sash, which we have adopted in imitation of your own architects. These marks a re circumscribed with particu- lar mysteries, which I grant to the Princes and Companions of this Court as an honour : and you will hereafter enjoy among them the same distinctions. I also present you with these remnants of your former temple, that were brought away at the captivity ; this Red Cross Jewel ; this olive branch, as an emblem of peace between us ; and the secrets of the Red Cross Sword Degree, as a proof of permission to leave this coun- try for your own. That you may pass without impediment through the provinces between this and Judea, you must give to the three first Babylonish Gu ards in succession the words of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and altogether to the fourth. These words will carry you to your native country : but if more is demanded of you, give them the sword up and down as a sign. The candidate retires ; the lodge or chapter is made to re- present a public road with a bridge over the river Euphrates in Babylon, with guards at each end. Zerubbabel appears, and is stopped by the first guard, who challenges him with—Who comes there ? He gives the answ er, sign, word, etc., and the same to the second guard. He passes through the dominions of the King of Babylon, and reaches the confines of Judea. On passing the bridge of the Jordan, he gives the third word tc the first guard, and to the last the three words. The guard re- plies—Thrice tried and thrice a pproved companion, pass in the name of the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The best scenery for this ceremony, that the place where the chap- ter is held will admit, is used. "},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 285 SECOND POINT . The candidate has now put off hi s rich attire as Zerubbabel, Prince of Jerusalem, and has put on that of first sojourner. Zerubbabel, Haggai, and Joshua , are supposed to have gone through the ceremonies of the Red Cross Sword Degree, and to have become principals, holding a Chapter or Sanhedrim on their own account at Jerusalem, to examine all who returned from their captivity, to prove th at they are legitimate descen- dants from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Ezra and Nehemiah are also officers of the Sanh edrim, the whole present being seventy-two. A report is made at the door by five distinct and two quick knocks ; and to the question of who comes there, is answered —A sojourner, a descendant of your forefathers, Abraham, lsaac, and Jacob, come out of Babylon to live with his breth- ren in Judea, and to assist in rebuilding the temple of the Lord. Janetor ( door-keeper ). What is your age ? Sojourner. Seventy years. J. None but architects and gr and architects can be admitted to the honour which you seek. If you possess the necessary qualifications, there is a vacanc y not yet occupied, and you may by civility and perseveranc e acquire those honours which avail true merit, without regard to birth or fortune. The candidate gives the signs of the ten preceding degrees, and enters upon the proper level. J. In the name of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, enter the grand Sanhedrim of Jerusalem, and give immedi- ately an account of yonr recent deliverance from your Baby- lonish captivity, and endeavour to prove that you are worthy of distinctions. On entering, he salutes the Sandedrim with the signs of the ten preceding degrees, and proceeds with the following narra- tion :— Most excellent. In due time I appeared before the throne of Cyrus, King of Persia and Babylon, who admitted the pro- priety of my application for freedom with fervency and zeal : and as the seventy years of our captivity had expired, he granted liberty that I should depart. He also armed me with this sword, and honoured me with th e appellation of Brother and "},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 286 Knight Companion of the Red Cross Sword. He furthermore gave me this apron and this sa sh, with this olive branch and these relics of our former temp le, which I now present as a proof of the goodness of Cyrus your deliverer. Z. Brother architect, the decorations convince us that your integrity and fortitude have been put to the test, and convince us also that pomp and grandeur will not triumph over the honours of Masonry. Cyrus, in decorating you with these, was guarded by a noble spirit ; but not that of equality which inwardly accompanies us. The distinctions of this prince you have nobly merited, and you ha ve also pursued those of Ma- sonry ; but, before you can be entrusted with the remaining secrets, you must further say th at your bondage has not oblite- rated from your mind the sentiments of a free man, that you are not incapacitated from attainin g the mysteries of the order. Therefore, you must first give me the signal which you re- ceived from Cyrus. The signal is given, and some other ceremony previous to the obligation, of which there is no copy among my documents ; but we have seen enough to see that they are all alike, and that the tenor of the one is the tenor of all. The obligation taken, Zerubbabel addresses th e candidate in the following strain :— It is onr intention, in future, to acknowledge those only as members of our order, whom we know to be true and legitimate masons ; not merely by their outward form, but by their manners and actions : and even th ey must bring with them as a pledge some part of the rem ains of the former temple. The intent of our labours is to rebui ld the temple of Jerusalem. The sword which Cyrus gave you must be used in defending your brethren and companions in arms, and to prevent all those who would profane the august edifice that we are now about to raise to the honour of the Suprem e Being. It is on these con- ditions that we entrust you with our secrets. After your deliver- ance Cyrus created you a Knight of the Red Cross Sword. I now present you with this trowel, which will serve as a per- petual memorial of your dignit y, and that, in future, you will work with your trowel in your hand, and your sword by your side, during the time that the temple is rebuilding. This sash is to be worn in all lodges and chapters ; and it will be the mark, that you have received two degrees of knight- "},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 287 hood. The chief emblem is the sword and trowel placed across. END OF THE DEGREE OF THE RED CROSS SWORD OF BABYLON . ———— A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF KNIGHTS OF THE SWORD OF THE EAST. T HERE is another degree, so much like the former, as to be made up of nearly the same word s, with some slight variations : it is called, RED CROSS KNIGHTS OF THE SWORD , OR OF THE E AST . The ceremony is precisely the same with regard to the dream of Cyrus. The reception and dismissal of Zerubbabel are precisely the same, only the tribute demanded is three lambs, five sheep, and seven rams . An escort is furnished to Zerubbabel. Without the escort we found that he travelled safely : with it he gets robbed on the bridge of all the insignia of the order which Cyrus had gi ven him ; but as they could not rob him of the secrets, he, of course, is received at Jeru- salem as a good masonic Jew. The penalty of the obligation is never to reveal the secrets of a Knight of the Sword, with- out suffering captivity for life. The sign of a masonic Knight of this degree is to place the right hand on the left shoulder ; letting it fall diagonally to the right side, as if cutting the body in two. The answer is to place the right hand upon the left hip, and to traverse the body to the right hip. The grip is to place the right hand upon th e sword, and to draw it, as if to fight. Then to make a move ment with the body as if to repel an enemy ; the left hand lifted up and closed. The words are Judea and Babylonia. The pass-word Liberty. The catechism will serve for either degree. CATECHISM . Q. Brother, how came you to the eminent degree of Knight of the Sword ? A. By humility, patience, and frequent application. "},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 288 Q. To whom do you address yourself ? A. To one who is greater than a king. Q. What is your name ? A. That you will find upon your records. Q. Your country ? A. Judea ; I am born of noble parents, and of the tribe of Judah. Q. What art do you profess ? A. Masonry. Q. What edifices do you build ? A. The temples and tabernacles. Q. Where do you raise them ? A. For want of ground we bui1d them in our hearts. Q. What is the genuine appellation of a Knight Mason ? A. A Free Mason. Q. Why called a Free Mason ? A. Because the Masons who w ere chosen by Solomon to work at the temple were declared , with their descendants, free and exempt from all imposts, du ties, and taxes. They had also a privilege to bear arms. Since the destruction of the Temple by Nebuchadnezzar, they were carried into captivity with the Jewish people ; but the good will of Cyrus gave them permission to erect a second temple, having first given them liberty. It is since this epoch that we bear the name of Free- masons. Q. What was the first temple ? A. It was the wonder of the world for riches and grandeur. Its porch would contain 200,500 people. Q. Who were the architects of this grand edifice ? A. The Creator of the world gave the design, and Solomon directed the workmen. Q. Who placed the first sign ? A. Solomon. Q. At what hour ? A. Before the rising of the sun. Q. Why ? A. To point out the alacrity required in the worship of the Deity. Q. Why is the No. 81 held in so much veneration among Masons ? A. Because this number explained the, triple essence of the "},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 289 Divinity, figured by the triple tr iangle, by the square of nine and the number three. Q. Why were the chains of the captives triangular ? A. The Assyrians understood that the triangle was consi- dered as an emblem of the name of the Eternal by their cap- tives. They, therefore, made their chains in that form, to render their situation more mortifying and severe. Q. Why is it prohibited that masons shall not work but at regular structures ? A. To teach us a duty that irregular lodges are not to be frequented. Q. What were the injunctions given by Cyrus respecting the second temple ? A. That it should be an hundred cubits long, sixty broad, and sixty high. Q. Why did Cyrus commend th em to take the wood from Lebanon and stone from Tyre ? A. That the second temple mi ght in these respects be equal to the first. Q. Who was the immediate architect ? A. Bebot. Q. Why were the workmen armed with swords ? A. As they were liable to be interrupted in carrying the materials, and even the work itself. Q. Are you a knight of the sword ? A. Look at me—( draws his sword .) Q. Give me the sign—( given ). Give me the words. A. Judea and Babylonia. Q. Give me the pass-word. A. Liberty. Q. Give the grip—( given ). Where have you worked ? A. At the rebuilding of the temple. Q. The instant of rebuilding ?

Very Excellent, since we are happy enough to have re- built the temple in its splendour, let us preserve the memory and remarks of it by our silence."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 290 A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF RED CROSS OF ROME AND CONSTANTINE. The Grand Master of this deg ree is called Constantine ; his deputy, Eusebius. There are also a Senior General, a Junior General, a Grand Standard-bearer and a Janetor or Tyler. We have seen that the forms of opening and closing in all the degrees are alike, the object being to ascertain that the mem- bers are not overlooked : that none but membersof the degree are present. In this degree, there is a difference only in the names of the officers, and the opening proceeds thus :— Constantine. Sir Knights Companions, assist me to open the conclave of Sir Knights Companions of the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine. ( All the knights rise, draw their swords, and stand in due form ). C. Sir Knight Eusebius, what is the first duty of the Companions of this order ? E. To see the conclave is properly cemented, and that the Janetor is at his post, duly armed and clothed. C. Sir Knight Junior General, see that duty done. ( This is done with two reports, in th e usual form ; and the same in- ternally, as in the other degrees ; after which, the conclave is declared open, in the name of Constantine, its noble and royal founder, by giving sixteen knocks and the grand honours .) CATECHISM . Q. Why do we open and close in tIlls degree with sixteen reports ? A. In allusion to the sixteen stars, surrounding the sixteen letters composing the Grand W ords In hoc signo vinces , in the form of the cross of Constantine, in the heavens. Q. How do we prepare our candidates for this degree ? A. In the clothing of a Roman soldier : the cross of Con- stantine in his right hand, and in his left a New Testament. Q. For what reason ? A. To hold in commemoration the miracle that wrought the conversion of Constantine and his enemies, his pious zeal "},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 291 for Christianity, and to denote that he was the first Roman Emperor to embrace the Christia n faith, and to propagate the same by the force of arms. Q. Why do we enter the conclave with two reports ? A. In commemoration of the famous cross and vision seen by Constantine in the heavens. Q. Be pleased to explain them. A. One evening, the army being upon its march towards Rome, Constantine, intent upon various considerations upon the fate of sublunary things and the dangers of his approach- ing expedition, sensible of his own incapacity to succeed without divine assistance, employed his meditations upon the opinions which were then agitated among mankind, and sent up his ejaculations to Heaven for an inspiration with wisdom to be able to choose the path pr oper to be pursued. As the sun was declining, there suddenly appeared a pillar of light in the heavens, in the fashion of a cr oss, with this inscription :— In hoc signo vinces . By this thou shalt overcome. So extraordi- nary an appearance did not fail to create astonishment, both in the emperor and his whole army, who reflected on it as their various dispositions led them. They who were attached to Paganism, prompted by their auspices, pronounced it to be a most inauspicious omen, portending the most unfortunate events. But it made a different impression on the emperor’s mind, who was further encouraged by the visions of the same night. He, therefore, the followi ng day, caused a royal stan- dard to be made, like that whic h he had seen in the heavens, and commanded it to be carried before him in his wars, as an ensign of victory and celestial protection. Q. Was there any other thing re markable in the life of our royal founder ? A. The arms of his soldiers, the public prayer, his charity, and tomb. Q. Be pleased to explain. A. As for the arms of his soldiers, which were newly sprung from gentility, not forgetting his vision and victory, he gar- nished with the sign of the cr oss, that thereby they might the sooner blot out from. their remembrance their old superstitious idolatry, and, in the spirit and truth, to worship the only true God. He also took into his se rvice, and bountifully rewarded, all such soldiers as had been cashiered upon the account of "},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 292 their being Christians, and prescr ibed them a form of prayer by way of confession of faith, in these words :—We acknow- ledge thee only to be our God: we confess thee to be our King : we Invoke and call upon thee to be our helper : by thee we obtain our victories : by thee we vanquish and subdue our enemies : to thee we attribute whatever conveniences we enjoy : and by thee we hope for good things to come. To thee we direct our suits and petitions, most humbly beseeching thee to protect and preserve Constantine our Emperor, his noble children, and all Christians : and beg of thee, our everlasting King, to continue theni long in Hfe and give them victory over their enemies, through Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. The good emperor gave libera lly to the maintenance of schools erected for the encouragement of piety and learning, and granted large privileges to universities, commanding the scriptures to be diligently ke pt and continually read in all churches. He also liberally r elieved the necessities of the poor, remitting the fourth part of his rents and revenues to be disposed of for these and other pious uses. His tomb of grey marble continues at Constantinople to this day. Even the Turks retain a veneration for the memory of this worthy emperor. Accounting the six years Licinius reigned with him, the time of the persecution amounts to just three hundred years, when it ceased with this great emperor, who laid a lasting foundation for the honour of the Christian name. Upon this account his memory will flourish in the minds of all good men and Christian Masons, till time shall be no more. Q. In what manner do we enter the conclave at the time of our exaltation ? A. On the triangle, and with the pass-word, Constantine. Q. Why are we conducted ro und the conclave twelve times when we are exalted to this degree ? A. In commemoration of Constantine’s going twelve times round the plot of ground at Rome set apart for the church that he commanded to be built for the use of the Christians, when he carried upon his imperial shoulders twelve baskets of earth for the foundation, in memory of the twelve apostles. Q. Is there not a second reason ? A. In allusion to the twelve great pillars that support the Church of Rome, on which was de lineated an ahstract of the Acts of the Apostles. "},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 293 Q. Is there not a third reaso n why we are conducted round twelve times ? A. In commemoration of the twelve grand points con- nected with the cross of Christ, the zeal of our grand and noble founder, and that of his mother, St. Helena. Q. What was the first grand point ? A. The humility of Christ upon the cross. Q. The second ? A. St. Helena going from Rome to Jerusalem. Q. The third ? A. The pious and diligent enquiry of St. Helena after the sacred spot Golgotha. Q. The fourth ? A. St. Helena finds three crosses, and is much perplexed to know which is that of Jesus Christ. Q. The fifth ? A. Macarius, Bishop of Jerusa lem, directs St. Helena how to discover the cross of Christ from those of the two thieves. Q. The sixth ? A. The first public acts of St. Helena and Constantine after the cross of Christ had been found. Q. The seventh ? A. The two festivals of the Christian Church. Q. The eighth ? A. The cross taken away by one of the heathen emperors. Q. The ninth ? A. The restoration of the cross of Christ. Q. The tenth ? A. The Emperor Heraclius recovers for the Christians the cross of Christ, and carries it himself in his royal robes and pomp of state. Q. The eleventh ? A. Heraclius divests himself of his robes of royalty, and, in pious humble state, carries the cross into the church on Mount Calvary. Q. The twelfth ? A. The reign of the Son of God in the day of Judgment. Q. What are the grand words of this order ? A. In hoc signo vinces. Q. What are the pass-words ? A. Constantine and. M atthias.

A cross with the initials of the grand words I. H. S. V. In the closing of this degree, there is an invocation of thir- teen saints, or the twelve apostl es and Saint Paul, in the true Roman Catholic style. ———— A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF KNIGHTS OF THE WHITE EAGLE OR PELICAN. This degree in Scotland has been also called that of Knights of the Rosy Cross of Saint Andrew, and has been taken as the ne plus ultra of Masonry. In some cases it has borne that dis- tinction, which has also been th e case with several other de- grees before new ones were invented : I have another degree to come called ne plus ultra . This must pass as that of Knights of the Eagle and Perfect Mason. This degree has two points, and requires two apartments. The first to represent Mount Calvary ; and the second the instant of the Resurrection. In this, and in the ne plus ultra degree, we have a going down into hell ! The first apartment is hung with black, and lighted with thirty-three lights upon three candlesticks of eleven branches. Each light is enclosed in a sma ll tin box, and issues its light through a hole of an inch diameter. These lights denote the age of Jesus Christ. In three angles of the room, north-east, south-east, and south-west, are three pillars, of the height of a man, on the chapiters of which a word is written, making Faith, Hope, and Charity. Every lodge or chapter has its picture or draught, descrip- tive of its form, and of the proper places of its officers and emblems. The draught of this degree represents its lodge as a long square, with triple signs, on the exterior of which are written the words Wisdom , Strength , and Beauty , and on "},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 295 the interior, east, south, north, and west. On the east, at the south and north angles, the su n and moon and a sky studded with stars are painted. The clou ds very dark. An eagle is seen beating the air with his wings, as a symbol of the supreme power. There are also drawn three sq uares, containing three circles which contain three angles , or an equilateral triangle, each allegorical of Mount Calv ary. On the summit is a cubic stone pointed and painted, as if sweating blood and water, typical of the sufferings of the Son of God. Upon the cubic stone is a rose, whic h is compared to his sweet- ness, and the letter J, which means Jehovah, the expiring word. The space round the square is filled with darkness, to repre- sent that which happened at the crucifixion. Below it are all the ancient instruments and tools of Masonry, with the columns broken and divided into many parts, to denote that all the de- pending parts of the work of a mason could not be worked at the death of him who was master of it. Lower down is the veil of the temple rent into two parts. On the exterior of the oriental line is the colour, with the seven knots of union as perfect masons. Before the master is a little table, lighted by three lights, upon which, instead of the Bible, the gospel, com- passes, square, and triangle are placed. All the brethren are clothed in black, with a black sc arf from the left shoulder to the right side. An apron doubled with black, which must not be worn out of the first apartment. The master and the other officers wear on the neck a wide ribbon of black mohair, from which hangs the jewel. The master’s jewel is a blazing star of seven rays, in the middle of which is the letter G. The rays of the star are commonly of stone, and the mounting gold. The jewel of the Senior Warden is a triangle ; that of the Junior Warden a square and compa sses. The other officers wear their ordinary jewels, which are covered with a small bit of black cloth. The jewels of each brother are formed by the com- passes mounted, the points upon a quarter circle. At the head of the compasses is a blown rose, the stalk of which loses itself in one of the points. In the mi ddle of the rose is the letter G mounted upon a small crown. In the middle of the compasses is a cross, of which the first ext remity is comisant at the head of the compasses ; the second, opposed to it, touches the "},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 296 middle of the quarter circle : th e third and fourth abut on the middle of the points. Upon the cross is a pen in mosiac gold and silver. On each side, upon one reverse of the cross, is, in the middle, an eagle adosse , the wings stretched over the side, and the talons contracted up to the body. On the other is a pelican adosse , the wings extended, and having round her breast seven young ones, the beak s open and held up to receive the blood which flows from her wounded bouy to nourish them. This should be of gold or gilt, and is worn in the first apart- ment, at the bottom of a large Scotch red ribbon, with a small black rosette fastened at the top, and which marks the said degree. The second apartment, representing the instant of the resur- rection, is hung with tapestry, luminous lights and full of glory, without a human figure. The three chandeliers, with thirty- three lights, illuminate this apar tment, but without the boxes. The master, the officers, and bret hren, on entering this apart- ment, take red sashes and aprons, with the jewels before men- tioned. They wear the sword and scarf, as in the preceding degree. The picture of this ap artment, is a long square with quadruple signs, with the words Faith , Hope , Charity , East , South , West , and North , written on the exterior, and an in- dented tuft in the east. In th e angles of the north and south, are the sun and moon in a sky stu dded with stars. In the first part of the east, a cross surrotm ded with a glory and a cloud, with seven angles ; upon the cro ss is a rose of Paradise, in the midille of which is the lett er G. Below are three squares, in which are three circles, having three triangles, to form the summit, which is allegorical of Mount Calvary, upon which the Grand Architect of the Universe expired ! Upon this summit is a blazing star, with seven rays shining with all its splendour, and in the middle of it the lett er G. The star represents, al- legorically, the Son of God resuscitated in all his glory. On the south side is a pelican, upon its nest piercing her bosom, whence issues three streams of bl ood to nourish the seven young ones ; which is an image of parental tenderness. On the north is an eagle beating the air with its wings, as an image of supreme power. Below is the tomb. In the lower part of the said square, upon the middle line from the east to the west, are the compasses, draw ing board, crow, trowel, and square. Upon the south line is the cubic stone pointed, and "},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 297 its hammer, the rule and level. Upon the north line, the rough stone and hammer, the mallet an d chisel, the plumb-line and the perpendicular. On the exterior of the east line, the column and the seven knots of union as perfect masons. The Master of this lodge allego rically represents the person or Wisdom and Perfection, wh ich gives him the title of most wise and perfect master . The wardens are styled most excellent and perfect . The other officers most puissant and perfect brothers , adding the title of their office. The brethren are called most respectable and perfect Masons , having the title of perfect only in the second apartment. In the second apartment there are no other tables but that on the right of the master, very small, and of a triangular form. There is nothing. upon it but the book of the gospel, the tools of masonry, and three lights. The officers and the brethren, when in this apartm ent, take the red sashes and aprons, adding thereto the jewels, which they wore in the first apartment, at the bottom of the black sash. FORM OF OPENING THE FIRST APARTMENT . The brethren assembled, master in the east and wardens in the west, he says, aid me to open this lodge. The wardens re- peat the words. The master give s seven slow reports with the mallet, and a double distance of time between the sixth and seventh. This is called reporting as a Knight of the Eagle. The wardens repeat the report. Master. Most excellent brother Senior Warden, what is the first duty of a Mason ? S. W. Most wise and most perfec t, it is to see if the lodge is tiled. M. Let the most excellent brother Junior Warden examine if the lodge be covered. The Junior Warden does this, and reports to the Senior, and he to the Master, that the lodge is covered. M. Most excellent brother Senior Warden, what hour is it ? S. W. The hour of a perfect mason. M. What is the hour of a perfect mason ? S. W. The instant when the veil of the temple is rent, when darkness and consternation sp read upon the face of the "},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 298 earth, the light is obscured, the tools of masonry are broken, the blazing star disappears, the pointed cubic stone sweats blood and water, and the word is lost. M. Most excellent brother, since masonry undergoes so great a preparation, let us emply our diligence in fresh labours for the recovery of the word. The Lodge of Knights of the Eagle is open. The wardens repeat the same word s, and then all give three huzzas and remain silent. RECEPTION IN THE FIRST APARTMENT . The candidate is clothed in black, decorated with a red rib- bon, an apron doubled with th e same colour, and a sword and scarf. His eyes are not covered. The deacon who prepares him, says :—The temples of the Masons are demolished, the tools and columns are broken, an d the word is lost since the last reception. In spite of th e precautions we had taken, we have lost the means of regaining it, and the order in general is in the greatest consternation. The candidate ready, the deacons conduct him to the door of the lodge, and make the report of seven. The Junior Warden answers from within, and gives him the seven upon the mal- let of the Senior Warden, he returns seven upon the mallet of the Junior Warden, who says :—Most excellent and perfect Brother Senior Warden, one knocks at the door of the lodge after the manner of the Kn ight of the Eagle. The Se- nior Warden makes the report to the master, who says :—Most excellent and perfect brother Senior Warden, let the most ex- cellent and perfect Brother Juni or Warden see who knocks at the door of the lodge, with the usual precautions. The Senior repeats this to the Junior Warden, who goes to the door, ex- changes seven reports with the deacons, opens it, and asks who is there ? Deacon. It is a Knight Maso n, wandering among the woods and mountains, who, since the destruction of the temple, has lost the word, and requests your assistance to seek and re- cover it. The Junior Warden knocks again on the mallet of the Senior, and receives the compliment in return. He then re- ports the words of the Deacon, ahd the Senior reports them to the Master. "},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 299 M. Most puissant and perfect brothers, do you consent to his introduction ? ( They assent by striking their hands against the lodge .) All now appear in consternation and affliction, sitting with the right hand on the heart and the left on the face, the head droopmg, and the elbow on the knees. The Master leans for- ward on the table after saying :—Most excellent and perfect brother Senior Warden, let the most excellent and perfect brother Junior Warden introduce the Knight Mason and place him in the west, to answer the questions which will be put to him. The Senior communicates the. order, and the Junior goes to the door, makes the seven reports, and receives the same from the Deacon. He opens the door and conducts the candi- date to the west : then gives seven reports upon the mallet of the Senior Warden, and receives his reply, when he says : —Most excellent and perfect brother Senior Warden, I bring to you a Knight Mason, who re quests the word. The Senior repeats this to the Master. M. Brother, corruption has glided among our work. It is no longer in our power to labo ur, you perceive the consterna- tion that reigns here. At this moment a strange confusion exists among us and over the face of the universe. The veil of the temple is rent. Darkness covers the earth. The sun is obscured. Our tools are broken . The blazing sun has disap- peared. The pointed cubical st one sweats blood and water, and the word is lost. You see that it is not possible to give it you ; however, it is not our design to despair : we will find out the new law, that we may recover the word. Are you also desirous of following the new law of the Christian Religion ? Candidate. Yes, Most Wise. M. Most excellent and perfect brother Junior Warden, make him travel for the space of thirty-three years, by the west, north, east, and south, that he may approve the beauties of the new law. The Junior Warden conducts the candidate thirty-three times round the lodge without stopping. In this travel, he makes him remark the three colunms in the three parts of the lodge. As he leads him to each, he tells him their names are Faith, Hope, and Charity,—bi dding him well remember these names, because they must henceforth be his guide. "},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 300 He leads him back to the west , where he gives seven reports with the mallet upon that of the Senior Warden, who returns the same. J. W. Most excellent and perfect brother Senior Warden the mysterious voyage is accomp lished. The Senior Warden reports it to the Master. M. Brother N ——, what have you learnt in this journey ? Candidate. Three virtues, to be my guide henceforth. Faith, Hope, and Charity. Teac h me if there be any others to seek and follow. M. No, my brother, these a re positively the principles and the pillars of our new master ; approach and take with us the engagements we require. The Senior Warden makes him ap- proach the table, and kneel wi th his right knee upon the gos- pel ; and in this posture he takes the following OBLIGATION . Yes, I promise, by the same ob ligations which I have taken in the former degrees of masonry, never to reveal the secrets of the Knight of the Eagle, to any Knight Mason, Grand Archi- tect, Master Mason, Fellow Craft, or Entered Apprentice, nor to the uninitiated, under the penalty of being for ever deprived of the true word, of remaining in perpetual darkness. That a river of blood and water shall issue continually from my body, and under the penalty of suffering anguish of soul, of being steeped in vinegar and ga ll, of having on my head the most piercing thorns, and of dying upon the cross ; so help me the Grand Architect of the Universe. The Senior Warden leads the candidate to the right, and puts the black apron upon him, telling him that it is the mark of all masons, who have not aided in causing our grief, but that it ought to represent to us the image of it, and to serve us for a knowledge of those among us, who seek to re- ceive the true word, and to be enlightened in the new mystery, by a real contrition and perfect humility. In taking the sash, and passing it from the left to the right, he says :—The sash is a symbol of our sorrow for the loss of the word. You ought to know it is a mark of grief, until that is recovered. Go to the west and assist us in recovering the loss of that word. "},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 301 The candidate places bimself between the two Wardens. The master gives seven reports, which are answered by the Senior warden. The brethren raise their heads, cross their arms with a hand on each breast, and appear less sorrowful. M. Most excellent and perfec t brother Senior Warden, what is the motive of our assembling ? S. W. The pointed cubical stone sweating blood and water, through the relaxations of masons from labour, and through the errors of Masonry, exposed on the summit of a mountain, cut with the point of a diamond. M. What means this mystery ? S. W. The loss of the word of a Mason, which is lost indeed ; but may, we hope, by our aid be recovered. M. What must be done to regain it ? S. W. We must embrace the new law, and be well con- vinced of its three virtues, whic h are its pillars, its base, and principles. M. What are they ? S. W. Faith, Hope, and Charity. M. How shall we find these three pillars ? S. W. In travelling and wandering in the greatest obscurity. M. How long ? S. W. The space of three days. M. Let us go, brother, from the east to the south, from the south to the west, from th e west to the north, and en- deavour not to lose siKht of the sentiments which may guide us. All rise in silence, and make thirty-three steps of the round of the lodge. Before the last se ven, the master goes from that apartment to the other, where he gives up his sash and black apron to take the red ones. He is followed by all the brethren, who do the same. He then wa lks towards the door of the second apartment, which is expressly prepared for THE SECOND POINT OF RECEPTION . The apartment for the preparation and for this reception is a third, the most remote from the others, and made as terrifying as possible, to resemble the torm ents of hell. It has seven chandeliers, with grey burning flambeaux, whose mouths re- present death’s head and cross bo nes. The walls are hung with tapestry, painted with flames, and figures of the damned. "},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 302 In entering the second apartment, the Master gives seven equi-timed reports, which are ca lled the report of the Perfect Mason. The door is opened by a brother appointed to guard it, and to whom each gives the report of a perfect mason and the pass-word Emanuel. The candidate comes last, and re- ports as a Knight of the Eagle, and is deficient of the pass- word, on which admittance is ref uued. He says, “I am one of the brothers, who seek the wo rd lost, by the aid of the new law and the three columns of ma sonry.” At these words, the guard who knows h.im to be a candidate, takes his sash and apron from him, saying, thes e marks of decoration are not humble enough to qualify him to find it, and that he must pass through much more vigorous trials. He then covers him with a black cloth, covered with dirty ashes, so that he can see nothing, telling him that he is to be conducted to the darkest of places from which the word must come forth triumphant to the glory and advantage of masonry, and that he must abandon all self-confidenc e. In this condition, he is conducted into an apartment in which there is a steep descent up and down which he is directed to travel : after which, he is conducted to the door and has the black cloth removed. Before him stand three figures dressed as devils. He is then ordered to parade the room three times, without pronouncing a word, in memory of the mysterious descen t into the dark places, which lasted three days. He is then led to the door of the apart- ment, covered with black cloth, an d told that the horrors through which he has passed are as noth ing in comparison with those through which he has to pass ; therefore he is cautioned to summon all his fortitude, to meet the dreadful scene. Thus prepared, he is brought to the door of the second apart- ment, and whilst the Wardens a re answering the reports, he is instructed how to answer their questions, and told that a misfortune will befall him if he does not answer correctly. The ceremony of successive reporting takes place within, and the Junior warden is instructed to enquire with the usual precau- tions. These precautions are the reports and the challenge of —Who comes there, and what is your request ? Deacon. It is a Knight of th e Eagle, who, after penetrating the deepest place, hopes to procure from you the word as the fruit of his research. The door is again shut, and th e usual ceremony of reporting "},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 303 gone through. The Master orders the candidate to be intro- duced, which is done in the sa me ceremonial form, finally in- troducing him to the Master, as a Knight of the Eagle, de- sirous of recovering the lost word, and of becoming perfect mason. M. From whence came you ? N. From Judea. M. Which way did you come ? N. By Nazareth. M. What is the name of your conductor ? N. Raphael. M. Of what tribe are you descended ? N. Judah. M. Give me the four initials of these four words. N. I. N. R. I. M. What do these four letters signify ? N. Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews. M. Brother, the word is found; let him be restored to light. The Junior Warden quickly shak es off the black cloth, and at the signal of the master, all the brethren clap their hands three times and give three huzzas. The Master says, approach my dear brother, that I may communicate to you the last words of perfect masonry. He is conducted to the Master, who gives him the sign, word, and grip. M. Our signs, to know each ot her in this degree, are, first, to raise the eyes to heaven, crossing the hands, with the fore- finger pointed upwards, and letting them fall together on the belly. This is cailed the sign of admiration. The second which is the answer to it is, to lift the right hand and to point the index towards heaven, the other fingers being clenched to denote that there is but one being, who is the sovereign and pure truth. The grip is to lay the hands on the breasts of a brother and to begin with one. To know a brother you place either hand cross-ways, or the right hand to the right breast. He answers \\vith his left hand to your lef t breast, and with the other hands in the same manner. This is called the good posture. The word is the I. N. R. I., and the pass-word Emanuel. The candidate is told to practise the grip and word with each perfect mason in the lodge, and lastly with the Master. "},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 304 After which he receives the rosette and jewel or a Knight of the Eagle and Perfect Mason, and has it attached to the bottom of his grand Scotch ribbon. M. Brother N——, this rosette is to remind you of the loss of the word, and this jewel will teach you, by its symbol, that masonry includes a mvsterious allegory concealed from all but perfect Masons. The cross of yo ur jewel should be known to you better than I can explain it. May you never lose the memory of it. We will proceed to your instruction in THE HISTORICAL DEGREE OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE EAGLE. After the rebuilding of the temple, the Masons having neg- lected their labours, and abandoned to the rigours and vicissi- tudes of the times the valuable buildings which they had raised with so much pains, their works fitted with so much decency, the wisdom of their workmanship, the strength of the materials and the beauty of the architecture were alike ex- posed to corruption, confusion, and disorder. The grand Archi- tect of the Universe determined to manifest his glory, and to abandon the support of the materials to the vicissitudes of time, in order to erect in its stead the sublime and spiritual geometry, whose existence human power should not be able to attack, and whose duration should be through an eternity of ages. It is in consequence of this resolution that men have seen the miraculous phenomenon, that prodigy of prodigies, the cubical stone sweating blood and water, and suffering anguish of soul. It was then th at the stone, the corner of the building, was torn by the workme n from the foundation of the temple, to be thrown among the ruins, and that the mystic rose was sacrificed on a cross, planted on the summit of the mountain, which is elevated above the surface towards the celestial globe, by three squares, three circles, and three triangles, cut with the point of a diamond. In an instant Masonry was dest royed, the veil was rent, the earth was covered with darkness, the light was obscured, the tools of Masonry were broken, the blazing star disappeared, the word was lost. It may easily be imagined into what a depth of misery every mason was plunged. At that fatal "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 305 moment, an unaccountable dism ay, a vast consternation was the least of their pains. They were obliged, for the space of three days, to wander in the deepest obscurity, uncertain, whether, by some fresh accident, it would be taken from them. Never before was such great p erplexity experienced by the human heart. But the will of Hi m, who conducts and rules all events, and who had caused this universal astonishment, at the expiration of three days, caus ed the light to shine again ; but as a brilliant testimony, behold a new phenomenon.—The broken tools of masonry were ag ain made entire ; the blazing star shone in all its splendour, nay, with a greater brilliancy, and the word was found again. This happiness happened, however, only to those Masons who had shaken off the negligence and hardness of heart into which they had fallen. Some of them, having travelled the space of thirty-three years, in search of the word, taught others, that it was necessary to know the three pillars—Faith, H ope, and Charity, and to fol- low the new law, in the hope of re-entering on the mystic la- bours of their order. It was on ly by means of these new prin- ciples, that masonry re-appeared in the light of man, under the rules which allegorically conducted them to practise it in their actions. From this time, masons no more built material edi- fices ; but occupied themselves in spiritual buildings. They fortified their works by tempera nce, prudence, justice, and strength ; and they no longer feared the vicissitudes of the times. May you, my dear brother, never want these supports, and may the Grand Architect of the Universe be your aid and guide. FORM OF CLOSING THE LODGE . The Master and Wardens give the seven reports. M. Most excellent and perfect Brother Senior Warden, what hour is it with perfect masons ? S. W. The moment when the word has been recovered, when the pointed cubical stone has been changed, the mystic rose and blazing star restored with greater splendour, when the tools are restored entire, and th e light has re-appeared to our eyes with greater brilliancy, wh en the darkness is dispersed, and the masonic law firmly established among the labourers in masonry. "},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 306 M. Most excellent and perfect Brother Senior Warden, fol- lowing this law, because it is the end of all the wonders which have astonished our eyes, I pronounce that the lodge of per- fect Masons is closed. The Wardens repeat these words, and an the brethren give three claps and three huzzas. ———— A DESCRIPTION OF THE ROSICRUCIAN OR NE PLUS ULTRA DEGREE. This dignity is considered as the ne plus ultra of masonry. The possession of it is of that importance, that the members have a right to be admitted into inferior lodges without exami- nation. Yet the Knights of the Rosy Cross are more parti- cular in demanding demonstrative proof from strangers, than any other order of masonry. Th ey will not accept as a visitor any brother unless he is well kn own, or can give a ready an- swer to any question proposed. They advance no person who has not been admitted into all the preceding degrees. There are three points in the Rosicrucian system : the first and second are called sovereign chapters, and the third the mystic supper. The latter of wh ich is held only four times a year. The officers are called most wise , orator , secretary , and mas-ter of the ceremonies . The brethren are styled most respectful knights . The jewel of this dignity is a triangle formed by a compass and a quarter of a circle. In th e centre is a cross, upon which is a rose, and upon the quarter of the circle is a pelican, bleed- ing to feed her young. The jewe l is tied to a black rose, and pendant to a black collar, in th e first point, and to a crimson in the second. The decorations of the lodge, in the principal apartment, are first a triangaular altar on seven steps. Behind it is a large transparency, with a cross and a rose painted on its middle, and an inscription over it, of Je sus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews. Broken columns are vi sible on one side of the trans "},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 307 parency, and a tomb on the other in the east, with three large lights in the west. This preparation serves for the three points, except at a re- ception, when, for the first point, the whole is covered with black, and three columns are plac ed, with the theological vir- tues on them, or Faith, Hope, and Charity.—Two other apart- ments are essential for the introduction ; one is denominated the chamber of the last degree, and the other is called the ob- scure chamber, no other light being admitted. FIRST POINT . The Most Wise is seated on the third step of the altar, with his head supported by one of his hands. He strikes five equal and two quick strokes, saying,—What hour is it ? A. The first hour of the day. M. W. It is time, then, to commence our labours. Invite the most respectable knights to assist us to open the sovereign chapter of the Rosy Cross. We are overcome with grief ; the veil of the temple is rent ; the columns of masonry are broken ; the cubical stone has sweated blood and water ; the word is in danger of being lost, and it is almost finished. Most respectable Knights, let us confer with each other, and trace the outlines of the word before it is too late. (They make up the word I. N. R. I.) I congratulate you all, that the word is known. What else remains for us to do ? Orator. Most Wise, we respect the decrees of the Most High, render homage to the Supr eme Architect, and bend the knee to him from whom we derive our existence. The chapter rises and turns to wards the east, makes the sign, bends forward and kneels. Then all rise up and strike seven with their hands, saying, Oyer . M. W. I declare this sovereign chapter to be assembled. Give notice to the candidate to present himself. The candidate is in the chamber of the last degree, and writes his name, his address, the degrees of Masonry through which he has passed, and states his age to be thirty-three. The master of the ceremonies conducts him to the door, and demands admission as a Knight of the Red Cross, which is answered with the report of a Rosicrucian. M. W. See who waits. "},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 308 M. C. A candidate requests entrance to explore the myste- ries of this degree. A ballot for his admission takes pl ace, and, if in the affirm- ative, the chapter gives seven plaudits, exclaiming Oyer three times. M. Z. Permit the candidate to enter. At this moment the M. C. puts the insignia of a Rosicru- cian on him, and conducts hi m into the chapter. The mem- bers appear sorrowful. He presents him by acquainting the Most Wise that a Worthy Knight of the Red Cross requests the honour of obtaining the favour of being admitted to the sublime degree of a Rosicrucian. M. W. Worthy Knight, who are you ? Candidate. I was born of noble parents, and of the tribe of Judah. M. W. What do you possess ? N. Masonry. M. W. Worthy Knight, you inspire us with esteem ; but you perceive, that sorrow abides with us. All is changed. The ground support of the Temple is no more. The veil is torn. The columns are broken. The most precious ornaments are taken, and the word is in danger of being lost. It may be recovered by your courage, and we shall certainly employ you in that pursuit. But you ma y assure us, by an obligation that if you obtain the knowledge of our mysteries, you will never communicate them to others, unless they are qualified to receive them. If you are willing, approach the altar, bend your knee to the ground, and place your right hand on the Holy Law, repeating the obligation after me :— The penalty of this obligation is, to be dishonoured and ba- nished from all the lodges, as being unworthy to form a com- panionship with virtuous Masons. M. W. Worthy Knight of the Re d Cross, this is the last time I salute you as such. Henceforward, you will be digni- fied with greater power. The Master of the Ceremonies will conduct you where you are to obtain it. The columns before you are emblematical of the theological virtues. Imprint them on your mind, and let them be the foundation of your future welfare. Proceed now on your pilgrimage: but remember, that we await your return. May it be happy, and may you bring with you peace and felicity. "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 309 The candidate is led to the da rk chamber. Chains are rat- tled to intinlidate him : during which he traverses it seven times. In the interim, the columns are taken away and the black cloths removed, in the so vereign chapter, which makes it a transition to the apartment for THE SECOND POINT . The candidate is brought into the chapter, and the subse- quent answers are dictated to him by the Master of the Cere- monies. Q. Worthy Knight, from whence came you ? A. Judah. Q. By what place have you passed ? A. Nazareth. Q. Who has conducted you ? A. Raphael. Q. Of what tribe are you. A. Judah. Q. Collect the initials of the names. A. I. N. R. I. M. W. It is the same as the inscription over the cross. It is the word which your zeal will render invincible, and which will be by you perpetuated till time shall be no more. Ad- vance and receive the honour due to your merit. ( Advances and kneels .) In virtue of the power that I have received from the metropolitan lodge of Harodim and in the presence of this august asselnbly of Knights, my brothers and my equals, I ad- mit, receive, and constitute you, at present, and for ever, a Knight Prince of the Eagle and of the Pelican, Perfect Mason, Free of Harodim under the title of sovereign of the Rosy Cross ; by which you enjoy the titles and prerogatives of Prince Perfect Mason, into the sixth degree of Knight of the Rosy Cross, without being in need of our particular authority ; our only reservation being that of the degree you have now re- ceived. The candidate rises, is invested with the crimson sash and jewel, and is entrusted with the sign, word, and grip. "},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 310 CATECHISM . Begins with the form of finding the word, already repeated. Q. What is the word among us ? A. The secret word of the knight of the Rosy Cross. Q. How did you come to the knowledge of this degree ? A. By three theological virtues. Q. Name them. A. Faith, Hope, and Charity. Q. In what were you farther instructed ? A. A sign and grip. Q. Give the sign and grip. A. Cross hands and arms and l ook to the east. The grip is made by mutually placing th e hands on each shoulder, that the arms may cross each other. The one says pax vobis ; the other, holy ends . Q. Have you any knowledge of the Pelican ? A. I have, Most Wise. Q. What does it import ? A. A symbol of the Redeemer of the World, and of perfect humility. Q. Why does the Pelican pierce its breast with its bill ? A. To nourish its young with its blood, and thereby to show that Christ our Redeemer so loved his young and old people, as to save them from deat h, by the shedding of his blood for your sins and mine. Q. What is the aim of the Rosicrucians ? A. To respect the decrees of the Most High, to render ho- mage to the Deity. M. W. It is our duty, as men, to do so, more particularly as masons, to bend the knee be fore him who gave us being. Master of the Ceremonies what is the hour of the day ? M. C. The last hour of the day. M. W. Since it is so, recollect our situations as Knights of the Rosy Cross, and retire in peace. The M. W. strikes seven, and the whole chapter give the sign and say Oyer . The sovereign chapter is closed. THIRD POINT . The third point is never held, except after the second, and then when it is held, the preceding poi nt is not held for it. A side- "},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY 311 board is prepared. This is covered with a table cloth, and on it are placed as many pieces of bread as there are Knights, and a goulet of wine. The paper with the sacred initials upon it is deposited on the altar. Every Knight has a white wand in his hand. The M. W. strikes his upon the earth twice, and declares that the chapter is resumed. Then he leads seven times round the apartment, and is followed by all present, each stopping in front of the transparency, to make the sign. At the last round each Knight partakes of the bread ; and, still preserving the form of a circle, the M. W. takes the goblet, drinks out of it, and passes it round. When it comes to him again, he places it upon the altar, and the Knights give each other the grip. The paper, with the sacred word upon it, is put into the empty goblet and burnt. The Knights make the sign, and the Most Wise says, CONSUMMATUM EST . "}]
