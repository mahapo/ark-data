It is now ti me we should i mpar t to you the histori cal, symbolical, and m ystical knowledge of our Order , and I request y our attention first to the Historic al Part from the Most En lightened Co mpan ion Joshua. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Address of the Third Chair. Historica l Lectur e. Joshua: Exal ted Co mpan ions, there are thre e epochs in Masonr y which part icularly merit your attention : the histor y of the first or Hol y Lodge; the second or Sacred Lodge ; and the third or Grand and Ro yal Lodge. The first or H oly Lodge was opened two y ears af ter the exodus of the Israel ites fro m their Egyptian bondage b y Moses, Aholiab, and Beza leel, on consecrat ed ground at the foot of Mount Horeb, in the wilderness of Sinai, where the host of Israel had assem bled and pitch ed the ir ten ts, to of fer up pra yers and thanksgivings for the ir signal deliver ance from the hands of the Eg yptians. In this pl ace the Almighty had thought fi t to reve al Hims elf before that time to His faithfu l servant Moses, when he co mmissioned hi m His high a mbassador of w rath against Pharaoh and his people, and of freedo m and salva tion to the house of Jacob. Here were del ivered the for ms of those m ysterious protot ypes, the taberna cle and the ark of the coven ant; here were de livered the sacred laws, engraven by the hand of the Most High, with those subli me and comprehensive precep ts of civil and religious polit y, which, b y separat ing His favoured peopl e from all oth er nations, consecrat ed Israel a chosen vessel to His service ; for these reasons this is denom inated the first or H oly Lodge. Solom on, King of Israel, Hiram , King of Tyr and Hira m Abiff, presided over the second or Sacred Lodge. It was opened in the bosom of the holy Mount Moriah, under the ver y centre of the ground on which the Sanctus Sanctuaru m was afterwards erect ed. On this consecrat ed spot Abraha m had proved his in tuitive fai th by leading his be loved son Isaac a dest ined vic tim to the altar of his God. Here, on the thrashing floor of Araunah, the Jebusite, David of fered th e mediatorial sacrif ice by which the plague was sta yed; here he received in a vision the for m of that magnificent temple afterwards erected by his illustr ious s on; and here the Almighty declared His s acred name should dwell; for which reasons we distinguish th is the second or Sacred Lodge. The third or Grand and Ro yal Lodge was holden a t Jerusale m; it was opened after the return of the Children of Israel fro m their Babylonish cap tivity, under Z erubbabel, prince of the peopl e; Haggai, the Prophet ; and Joshua, the son of Josedech, the High Priest. No w was the kingl y power restored in the person of Zerubbabel to the royal line of David and princ ely tribe of Judah. Nor was a vestige thereof aga in effaced unti l after the destruc tion of Jerusale m by the Rom ans under Titus, in the y ear 70 of the Christian era; to co mmemorate which restoration this is cal led th e third or G rand and Ro yal Lodge, and the rese mblance in the Chapter before us to these great orig inals is, tha t in every regul ar Ro yal Arch Chapter we acknowledge the represen tatives of the Grand and Royal Chapt er at Jerusalem. The three Principals represent Zerubb abel, Haggai, and Joshua, whose na mes th ey bear; the two Scrib es represent E zra and Nehemia, Selectors and Expounders of the sacred law , and att endants on the august Sanheidr im, by whose names the y are dist inguished. Your three selves represent the three faithful sojourners, by whom the secre ts of the Ro yal Arch were found, in consequence of w hich discover y they were honoured with seats in the august asse mbly, composed of the rulers and elders of the peopl e, represent ed by the rest of the Comp anions now present. Zerubbabe l: Such is the Historica l accoun t of this Degree. I shall now cla im your attention, while our Most Enligh tened Com panion Haggai gives an account of the symbolical part. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Address of the Secon d Chair . Symbolical Lectur e. Haggai: Exal ted Co mpan ions, the for ms, s ymbols, and ornam ents of Ro yal Arch Masonry, together with the rites and cer emoni es at present in use a mong us, were adopted by our predecessors at the building of the Second Temple, as well to preserve in our mi nds the providenti al means b y which the great discover y was ef fected, as in our hearts those lessons of exal ted morality which we, as m embers of this subli me Degree, are bound to practi ce. The form in which the Co mpan ions of ever y Royal Arch Chapter is arranged approaches as nearl y as circu mstances wil l permit to that of the true Catenar ian Arch; thus we preserve th e memorial of the vau lted shrine, in which th e Sacred Na me was deposit ed, while from the impenetrable nature of this strongest of a ll archit ectural for ms, we le arn the necessit y of guard ing our m ysteries from profana tion by the m ost inviolab le secrecy; it also strongl y typifies that inviolab le adher ence to order and spirit of fratern al union, which has given ener gy and per manency to the Constitutions of Ma sonry, enabling them to survive the wreck of m ighty empires and resist the destro ying hand of t ime. And as the subordinat e members of the Catenari an Arch natural ly gravi tate towards the cen tre, or ke ystone, which co mpresses and cements the whole structure, so we are taught to look up with rever ence, and subm it with cheerfuln ess, to every lawful ly consti tuted authorit y, whether of Ma sonic or civi l regulat ion. The keystone and two cont iguous arch stones are represented by the thr ee Principa ls of the Chapt er; for as the secrets cont ained under the Royal Arch could onl y be obtain ed by wrenching forth the three prin cipal stones thereof, so the complete knowledge of this Degree can only be obta ined b y passing through these several offices. In this Degree we acknowl edged six l ights; th e three lesser represent ing toge ther the light of the law and the prophe ts, and, b y their num ber, alluding to the patriar chal, Mosaic al, and prophetic al dispen sations; the three greater representing the sacred name itself, and the creativ e, preservat ive, and annihi lative power of the Deity. These lights are pla ced in the for m of an equil ateral triangle, each of th e lesser bissect ing the line formed by two of the great er, thus geo metrically dividing the grea t triangle into thr ee lesser triang les on the extre mities, w hich, by their union, for m a fourth tri angle in the centre, and al l of the m equal and equil ateral, emblematical of the four points or divisions of Masonr y, viz., En tered Apprentic e, Fellow Craf t, Master Mason and Hol y Royal Arch. This s ymbolical arrang ement corresponds to the triple tau, which forms two right ang les on each of the ext erior l ines, and two others at the ir centr e, by their union, for the thre e angl es of each tr iangle are equa l to two right angl es; this serves to illustra te the jewel worn b y some of the Com panions of the Order , which for ms by its intersec tions a giv en nu mber of angles; th ese m ay be taken in five severa l combinations, and when reduced into the ir amoun t in right angl es, will be found equal to the five regular platoni c bodies, which represent the four ele ments and the sphere of the universe. The ribbon worn b y the Com panions of th e Order is a sacred emblem, denot ing ligh t, being co mposed of the two prin cipal colours with which the vei l of the temple was interwoven; it is further signifi ed by its irr adiated for m, and in both th ese respects i t has ever been considered as an emblem of rega l power and digni ty. The ensigns w hich the Companions bear on their staves were the distinct ive bearings of the twelve tr ibes of Israel, and figurativ ely of a peculi ar blessing beque athed to each by the patr iarch Jacob, who, before his death, assembled them together for that purpo se, as we find in the 49th chapter of Genesis. The lead ing trib es are point ed out in the 2nd chap ter of N umbers. The four princ ipal banners represent the le ading standards of the four divisions of the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"army of Israel, as described in the Book of Genesis. They unitedl y bear a device of an angeli c natur e, under the figures of a m an, a lion, an ox, and an eagle : a man, to personif y intelligence and understanding ; a lion, to represen t strength and power; an ox, to denote the ministra tion of pa tience and assiduit y; and an eagle, to displa y the prom ptness and ce lerity with which the will and pleasure of the grea t I Am are execut ed. The severa l bear ings of the sceptr es denote the regal, propheti cal, and sacerdota l offices, which all were, and stil l ought to be, conferred in a pecu liar manner, accompanied with the possession of parti cular secrets. The Bib le, Square, and Compasses are considered as appropriat e emblems of the three Grand Masters who founded the First Temple: the Bib le denot es the wisdo m of King Solo mon; the Square, the power of King Hira m; and th e Compasses, the exqu isite skill of Hira m Abiff; but the truly specul ative Mason regards the m as the m ysterious s ymbols of the wisdo m, tru th, and ju stice of the Most High. Hi s wisdom is most amply exemplified in the Volum e of the Sacred Law, which contains the records of His mi ghty acts and the treasure of His reveal ed will. His truth is ju stly represented by the Square, it being the acknowledged symbol of strength, and the criter ion of perfec tion. His i mpartial and unerring ju stice, which has defined for our instruct ion the limits of good and evi l, and assigned to each its due proport ion of pleasure, is elucid ated by the Co mpasses, which enab les us to ascerta in the limits of all geometrical figures, and to reduce our ideas of the ir proportion and equal ity to a cert ain standard. The Sword and Trowel have been adopted by Masons of the Royal Arch to commemorate the valour of those worthy Masons w ho carr ied on the build ing of the Second Temple, with the Trowel in the ir hands and the Sword b y their sides, tha t they might be ever ready to defend the hol y city and sanctuar y against the unprovoked attacks of their enemies; by which th ey left a sacred and i mpressive lesson to succeeding ages: tha t next to the obedienc e due to lawful author ity, a ma nly and determined resistance to lawless violen ce is th e first step to social duties. The pick axe, crow , and shovel were the instrum ents used by the So journers in clearing away for the foundation of th e Second Temple: with the pick axe th ey loosened the earth, with the crow the y made purchases, and with the shovel they cleared awa y the rubbish and loose ear th. These we spiritu alise thus: the sound of the stroke of the pickaxe represents to us the sound of th e last trum p, when the graves shall be loosened and deliver up their dead; the crow , being an emblem of uprightness, displa ys to us the erect manner in which we shall rise on that awful da y to meet the tr emendous but merciful judge; the m ortal state in which the body is laid in the grave is powerfull y impressed on our mi nds b y the work of the shovel, so that when the rubbish of the body is shovelled away we ma y with hum ble but hol y confid ence hope that the spiri t may arise to immortal and etern al life. Zerubbabe l: Such is the symbolical account. I shal l now proceed to explain the mystical part.

In Ro yal Arch Masonr y there are five signs, corresponding in nu mber to the five"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Points of Fellowship, in which the Master Mason is instruc ted; and as these point out our relat ive duties to ea ch other , so do the for mer mark in a pecul iar m anner the relat ion we bear to the Almighty as creatures of fending against His power , yet still as the adopted children of Hi s mercy. The first is call ed the Penal Sign, gives it and alludes to the fal l of Adam and of the dreadful penalt y entai led thereb y on al l his sinful posterity, no less than dea th. It intimates, by the ver y action itself, that th e stiff-necked and disobedi ent shall be cut off from the land of the living by the judgm ent of G od, even as the head was s evered from the bod y by the sword of hu man justice. To avert this we are taugh t, by the Reverent ial or Hailing Sign, to bend gives first part of Sign with subm issive resigna tion beneath the chastening hand of the Almigh ty, and at the same time to engraft His law on our hearts completes Sign and r etains . This expressive for m, in which the father of the hu man race first presented himself before the face of the Most High, to rece ive the denunci ation of His just and terr ible judgment disengages Sign was afterwards adopt ed by Moses, when the Lord appeared to hi m in the Burning Bush, in Mount Horeb, thus he covered his face does s o from the brightn ess of Divin e presence and laid his hand on his heart does so , in token of obedi ence; which act of saluta tion was afterwards ac counted to hi m for righteousness drops Sign . The Reverent ial of Hailing Sign ma y be consider ed as the parent of the Penit ential or Suppli cator y Sign, since it justly denotes tha t frame of heart and m ind, without which our pra yers and oblat ions of praise canno t obta in acc eptan ce at the throne of grace, before which how should a frai l and erring crea ture of th e dust present hi mself but with bended knees kneels and uplif ted hands does so , betokening at once his hu mility and dependen ce? Thus did Adam first kneel to God and bless the author of his first being; thus, too, did he bend with contr ite awe before the face of his offended Judge, to aver t His wrath and conc iliate His mercy, and has transm itted th is sacred sign to his po sterity for ever drops Sign and rises . The Monitori al Sign re minds us of th e weakness of hum an natur e, unabl e of itself to resist the powers of darkness, unless as sisted by that light which is fro m above points up . By this defencel ess po sture gives it we acknowledge our o wn frai lty, and confess that we can do no good or accep table services, but through Hi m fro m whom all good counsels and ju st works proceed, and without whose Divine and special favour we m ust ever be found unprofitab le servants in His sight ; therefor e, accord ing to the m anner of our ancestors, and atoning priests, we adopt this outward sign of contr ition and hu mility dismisses Sign . The Fiducial Sign shows it and m aintains it shews that as we w ould prostrate ourselves with our fac es to the earth, so we m ust throw ourselves upon the m ercy of our Creator and Judge, looking forward with holy confiden ce to His grac ious prom ises, b y which alone we hope to pass through the ark of our rede mption into the mansions of eterna l bliss and glor y to the presence of Hi m who is the Great I Am, the Alpha and Omega, the first and th e last dismisses Sign .

There is also the triple tau, which is a charac ter af fixed to the summonses of Ro yal Arch Ma sons.

The union of the three taus here represen ted alludes to the grand triun ison, b y which the horrific, gloo my, and unshapen chaos wa s chang ed into regular form and peac eful existence.

The select ion of those m athematical figures, the circle and tri angle, deserves y our atten tion: the la tter seem s to have been alwa ys considered as bear ing an al lusion to the Deit y; for even in the re mote times of ant iquity names of God, or s ymbols of divin ity, were general ly enclosed in a triangul ar figure.
