THE FIRST SECTION. THE THEORY OF THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE. THE Degree of Entered Apprentice is the initial letter of the Masonic alphabet, the first round in the ladder of grades, variously numbering three, seven, nine, eleven, twenty-nine, one hundred and twenty-five, or whatever figures the fancy of modern ritualists may assume to embrace all the Degrees of Freemasonry. An Entered Apprentice is a beginner, a neophyte. All that is ex- plained to him in the First Degree must be in the sense of laying down a foundation; for he can have no pre- vious information or instruction upon which to base it. Yet the Entered Apprentice, in theory, is already a Mason, even before he enters the Lodge;, that is, he must be already prepared in heart, for there is nothing in Masonic science that can do the work of heart-prepa- ration. And the neophyte must have had some exoteric knowledge of Masonry as a public institution, because he is required to declare that \"he has long entertained a favorable opinion of it.\" She theory which makes the character of the Entered (13)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. Apprentice that of \"a hewer of wood and drawer of water\" does not militate against the fact that to his more advanced brethren he is \"not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved.\" ASK AND RECEIVE. The manner of application at the door of God's favor, symbolized in the Closed Door, is described in various passages. God said to Solomon: \" Ask what I shall give thee.\" Elsewhere it is recorded: \"Ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein.\" \"Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.\" \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" \"If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" In close connection with the symbolism of the Closed Door is that of tho Three Knocks, peculiar to the Ma- sonic Ritual. A splendid genius, now deceased, extend- ing the Masonic theory beyond the vale of time, figures the Grand Master of the Universe standing in the Celes- tial Orient upon \"the appointed day,\" and giving the Three Knocks which shall summon the sheeted dead. At the first knock, the ground of their interment begins to heave with expectation. All nature is hushed. Earth and heaven await with trembling the consummation. At the second knock, bone comes to his fellow, flesh re- clothes them ; blood moves once more through the veins, and the dead are ready for the last summons. It falls, and at once the armies of the dead arise, stand erect, facing the East, and listen to the words of their Maker ! RIGHT ANGLES, HORIZONTALS, AND PERPENDICULARS.

All its instructions conform to mathematical ideas, and the simplest drawings of right angles, horizon- tals, and perpendiculars form emblems of greater signifi- cance upon its trestle-board. As the architect would say that \" all the parts of his edifice are tested by those three emblems, the square, the level, and the plumb, be- cause they are the instruments by which the right angle, the horizontal, and the perpendicular are made upon his drawing,\" so in Freemasonry, which is but another name for moral architecture, all methods of communi- cation known to the ancient Craft are to be subjected to the same tests, and such as fail are spurious. Thus these simple emblems, the first upon the trestle-booard, become among the most important. When two per- sons meet, who are able to recount similar necessities, trials, and successes, what mutual disclosures take place ! What trustful communications, what tender sympathy is manifested! Then one soul gushes out and flows over into the other, and time steals rapidly on. Such is the nature of Masonic intercourse between sympathetic hearts. THE DAGGER. In the Master Mason's lecture, the em- blem of \"The Sword pointing to the naked Heart\" ex- presses the judgment reserved to the last day for those who presumptuously sin against God and their fellow- men. The same idea is conveyed, but in a more re- stricted form, by the emblem of the Dagger. It reminds us that there is an inward monitor, the conscience, which will not be silent when the heart has resolved upon sin. A person entering the Masonic institution with a view to betray its secrets and violate its covenants need not"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16 THE ENTERED think that our Order has no avenger. The voice of God within him is our avenger, and the eternal justice of Him who has wisely permitted the existence of this So- ciety for countless ages speaks even now through that voice to his heart, and will speak in thunder-tones to his guilty soul on the Judgment-day. It needs not that any penalty be inflicted by the Craft upon the betrayer of secrets save the necessary discipline of expulsion. We can leave the guilty in the hands of God, who is the avenger of his own laws. Nor can the utmost treachery of evil men divulge what it is our interest as a society to preserve. Our secrets are lawful and honorable. They were intrusted in peace and honor to the Masons of ancient times, and they will be so transmitted to the ages to come. THE APRON. There are two prominent ideas con- nected with the Masonic use of the Apron : that of pro- tecting the garments from the defilement of the materials with which the practical builders wrought, and that of the distinguishing mark or badge of the Craft. The first notice in Scripture of an Apron, is where our first par- ents, having their eyes opened, and seeing themselves naked, sewed together fig-leaves and made themselves aprons. But this was not worn for a purpose analogous to ours. The Masonic Apron is exhibited as a continual memento, both to himself and those around him, that he is under peculiar engagements to keep his conscience void of offense, both to God and man. But the idea, fully reviewed, becomes still more tender and affecting. The Masonic Apron is not made of mate- rial of an ordinary sort, such as is used for garments of warmth, decency, or protection. It is made of lamb-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE TWENTY-FOUR-INCH GAUGE. 17 skin, and that only, and it thus incorporates into its real ordinary meaning all that pertains to that Divine emblem of innocence. This makes up one of the finest allegories in Freemasonry, and those members of the Fraternity who are Christians see in their Apron every thing taught in the Altar, the Thorny Crown, and the Cross. THE TWENTY-FOUR INCH GAUGE. The proper division of our time involves every thing useful in our life. Our . time is our life; they expire together. He who wastes the one, wastes the other. Nothing but a systematic distribution of time can accomplish the purposes for which we were placed in this world. A portion for God, a portion for needful avocations, a portion for refresh- ment and sleep this is the division that Freemasonry enjoins. It were well for every member of the Craft to resolve, in his moments of prayerful reflection, that he will improve, in the best manner possible, all his leisure noments in growing in morality, and to be daily increas- ing his moral stature in conformity with the lessons in- culcated upon the Masonic trestle-board. THE COMMON GAVEL. The necessity of a great and radical removing of those evil things that incrust and encumber the conscience is as great as that of breaking off the outside crust and envelopments from the marble before a perfect statue can be formed. The emblem that suggests this necessity is the Gospel. How greatly the beauty of the immortal soul is disfigured, its useful- ness impaired, its happiness destroyed, and the God who made it, dishonored, for want of the proper use of this simple instrument for cleansing, trimming, and lightening the soil!

The combination of the 2"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"18 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. three objects, the Holy Bible, the Square, and the Com- pass, under this denomination, is not incongruous when the character of the instructions they convey to the Masonic mind is considered. The first guides our faith, the second our works, the third our passions. Belief, labor, spirit these are the three ideas conjoined in this beautiful trio. It is not the reverence we bear to them as tangible objects that is considered here. The Mason reveres the Bibh; he does not revere any other tangible object. But these three objects are conjoined here simply as emblems, or moral instructors, teaching great inward lessons by outward forms. THE THREE LESSER LIGHTS. Pursuing the imagery employed in the last paragraph, we make the three lesser lights, or mediums through which instruction is conveyed to the Craft, to be the Sun, Moon, and Master of the Lodge. The government of the Master is analogous to that exercised over the day by the Sun, over the night by the Moon a thought which is amplified in the lec- tures of the Past Master. Much care is exercised in the ritual of the Entered Apprentice to teach the respect due to the Master of the Lodge, without which, order would be lost and innovations flood the Institution. THE ALTAR. As a support to the copy of the Holy Scriptures, which forms so essential a piece in the fur- niture of the Lodge, the Altar would be a highly con- spicuous object, were there no other meaning conveyed by it. As an emblem, however, it calls to mind the piety of Abel, Noah, Abraham, and other Old Testament worthies, who are recorded as the builders of altars. It more particularly suggests a sacrifice of prayer and praise to God."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"PRAYER. 19 PRAYER. The motto, \"To Labor is to Pray,\" is most congenial to Freemasonry. Much will be said through- out this volume upon the use of prayer as an essential feature in the rituals of this ancient Institution. At first, man was permitted to converse with his Maker, face to face. But since the fall, a new, yet tender mode of communication has been divinely instituted between the soul and its Creator, and this is a fundamental land- mark in Masonry. FAITH. The first of the three principal rounds in the Masonic Ladder is denominated Faith. This is a grace of which the Holy Writings are full. It is the cheer of the sorrowing, and the life of the just. It is the credit we give to the declarations of God, or to the evidences of the facts or propositions presented us in the Bible. The faith, without which we can not please God, combines assent with reliance, belief with trust. True faith involves the forsaking of all known sin^ and a cheerful and con- stant obedience to God's commands. THE WISE CHOICE OF SOLOMON. The Entered Apprentice is one who, like the wise king of the line of David, chose the better part. When in the dreams of night he lay, Fancy-led through earth and air, Whispered from the heavenly way, The voice of promise met his ear; Fancy ceased his pulse to thrill Gathered home each earnest thought And his very heart was still, Awhile the gracious words he caught"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"20 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. \"Ask me whatso'er them wilt, Fame or wealth, or royal power; Ask me, ask me, and thou sbalt Such favors have as none before!\" Silence through the midnight air Silence in the thoughtful breast What of all that 's bright and fair, ' Appeared in youth and hope the best? *T was no feeble tongue replied, While in awe his pulses stood: \" Wealth and riches be denied, But give me WISDOM, voice of God! Give me wisdom in the sight Of the people thou dost know; Give me of thyself the light, And all the rest I can forego.\" Thus, Lord, in visions fair, When we hear thy promise-voice, Thus like him will we declare, That WISDOM is our dearest choice. Light of heaven, ah, priceless boon! Guiding o'er the troubled way; What is all an earthly sun, To His celestial, chosen ray? Wisdom hath her dwelling reared, Lo, the mystic pillars seven ! Wisdom for her guests hath cared, And meat, and wine, and bread hath given Turn we not, while round us cry, Tongues that speak her mystic word; They that scorn her voice shall die, But whoso hear are friends of God."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"LEBANON, JOPPA, AND MORIAH. 21 THE SECOND SECTION. THE Second Section of the Entered Apprentice's Lec- ture is explanatory of the first, being directed chiefly to showing how reasonable are all the ceremonies and ob- servances of initiation when properly explained. The greater part of it is esoteric, or private, and, as such, can not be explained to any save those who have regu- larly entered the portals of the Lodge. LEBANON, JOPPA, AND MORIAH. These three locali- ties in the Holy Land are closely combined in the Ma- sonic theory : Lebanon, as the source of the great cedars used in the construction of the Temple ; Joppa, as the place of their transhipment; Moriah, on the site upon which the edifice was built. The quarries from which the stone was drawn are supposed to be those found in the northern side of the range of hills on which the city of Jerusalem stands. The following lines express the symbolism which the words in the caption suggest : Thine in the Quarry, whence the stone For mystic workmanship is drawn; On Jordan's shore, On Zarthan's plain, Though faint and weary, thine alone. The gloomy mine knows not a ray; The heavy toil exhausts the day; But love keeps bright The weary heart, And sings, I'm thine, and thine alway. Thine on the Hill, whose cedars rear Their perfect forms and foliage fair; Each graceful shaft, And deathless leaf,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. Of Masons' love the symbols are. Thine, when a smile pervades the heaven; Thine, when the sky's with thunder riven; Each echo swells Through answering hills, My Mason-prayer; for thee 'tis given. Thine in the Temple, holy place, Where silence reigns, the type of peace ; With grip and sign, And mystic line, My Mason's love I do confess. Each block I raise, my friendship grows, Cemented firmly, ne'er to loose; And when complete, The work I greet, Thine in the joy my bosom knows. Thine at the midnight, in the cave ; Thine on the floats upon the wave; By Joppa's hill, By Kedron's rill, And thine when Sabbath rest we have. Yes, yes, dear friend, my spirit saith, I'm thine until and after death; No bounds control The Mason's soul, Cemented with a Mason's faith. THE SETTING MAUL. As it is one of the wonders of Divine power, and the fitness of things, that from poison- ous and inodorous flowers the insect extracts the purest honey, so it is in the transforming power of Masonic symbolisms to turn this emblem, the Setting Mauls, in itself suggestive of noise and violence, into a sweet em- blem of peace. \" The house was built of stone, made ready before it was brought thither, so that there was"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE SHOE. 23 neither hammer, ax, nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building.\" The analogy between operative and speeulative architecture seizes with avid- ity upon this sublime thought, and peace reigns through all the chambers of the Temple of Freemasonry. \" I will give peace in the land,\" promised Jehovah to his people, while yet in the wilderness, \" and none shall make you afraid.\" \"Behold I give unto him my cove- nant of peace.\" \" There is peace to thee, and no hurt.\" \" The Lord will bless his people with peace.\" \" Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace.\" Such are the thoughts suggested by the Setting Mauls. At the period of the temple-building, universal peace reigned throughout the earth, and thus the materials for building and adorning, which were brought from the utmost parts of the world, were readily collected. It is only in a time of peace that Freemasonry can flourish. THE SHOE. The Shoe was ever an emblem of signifi- cance in Freemasonry. To remove the Shoe, as Moses was commanded to do before the Burning Bush, arid as Joshua was commanded before Jericho, was a token of reverence. The High-Priest in the Temple went bare- foot, as a mark of Divine respect. The removal of the Shoe was also a token of humiliation and subjection, as when David fled before Absalom, and Isaiah walked barefoot for three years, and Ezekiel walked barefoot upon a certain occasion. Hence, the expression in Psalm cviii, \"Over Edom will I cast out my shoe,\" imports the subjugation of the country over which the shoe is cast. All these ideas are embraced, to a greater or less degree, in the Masonic use of the Shoe as an emblem."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. The plucking off one's shoe, and giving it to another, was a significant token of a surrendered right of privi- lege, and this is more directly the Masonic idea. It is this which is expressed in the following lines : Take this pledge ; it is a token Of that truth which ne'er was broken- Truth, which binds the mystic tie Under the All-seeing Eye. this pledge; the ancient brother By this type bound every other, Fondly, firmly; death alone Rends the bond that makes us one, Take this pledge ; the type so lowly Is, of all our symbols, holy; 'Tis Divine; it tells of One, Gives the raindrops and the sun. Take this pledge ; the token sealeth All the Judgment-day revealeth; Honor, truth, fraternal grace In thy hands with this we place, THE CABLE-TOW. The explanation of this emblem is that of the covenant or tie that binds Masons to each other and to the institution. That this tie must be one of much strength , is evidenced by the great antiquity of the Masonic Order, and the firmness with which it* mem- bers, in all ages, have resisted every allurement to be- tray their trust. Scriptural quotations convey the spirit of this emblem: \"Draw me not away with the wicked.\" \"Draw me, and we will run after thee.\" \"No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath sent me, draw"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE DAGGER. 25 him.' 5 \"If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.\" \"We are not of them who draw back unto perdition,\" The extent or reach of the Masonic covenants, repre- sented by the Cable-Tow, is well expressed in the moni- torial explanation of the extent of the Lodge. It reaches as far as to heaven, suggesting our duty to God; as far as the utmost bounds of the habitable earth, suggesting our duty to our fellow-men ; as far as the inmost re- cesses of our own hearts, suggesting our duty to our- selves. There is a cord of length, There is a chain of strength Around you each I see the sacred coil; How long, ah, well I know; How strong, your deeds do show The while you labor in the sacred toil. THE DAGGER. Our remarks upon a preceding em- blem, the SETTING MAULS, are partly applicable here. Although the Dagger is a warlike weapon, yet, as a Masonic emblem, it has its application, in a gentle and pacific character. It suggests the quiet conscience, which results from a sense of Masonic covenants kept and duties done. Tliis inward monitor, the -conscience, which is the terror of the wicked, is the sweetest com- panion of the virtuous mind. Paul wrote to his con- verts, \"Our rejoicing is in this, the testimony of our conscience;\" and, again, \"We trust we have a good conscience in all things, willing to live honestly.\" In an address he says, \"Herein do I exercise myself to have always a good conscience, void of offense toward God and toward men.\" \" They being convicted by their"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. own conscience, went out one by one,\" is the description of a scene in which the Scribes and Pharisees of olden time figured. Cain, after the cruel blow fell which de- prived him of his brother, was convicted by the voice of his own conscience. The further application of this em- blem may be seen under the same head upon a preceding page. THE JOINED HANDS. This is an emblem of Fidelity, an ingredient in the Masonic cement without which the walls of the institution would speedily crumble and fall. As -an emblem, it was well known to the first painters and sculptors of antiquity. Jonathan and David exem- plified this principle in a remarkable degree. He alone who is capable of genuine friendship can appreciate the happiness of reciprocating tokens of fidelity with those who are deserving of confidence. The right hand, which is the instrument of mechanical activity and of strength, is also the seat of Fidelity. \"Thy right hand, God,\" saith the Prophet of Abarim, \"is become glorious in power.\" \"From the Lord's right hand went a fiery law for them.\" \"Thy right hand,\" says the Psalmist, \"hath holden me up. Save with thy right hand, Lord !\" The use- of the right hand, through all the grades of Freemasonry, is peculiarly impressive. It combines the idea of strength with that of love. Taking the candi- date by the right hand is an assurance of protection, of brotherly guidance, of brotherly affection. It, in effect, says to him, that the security of the Craft is around him, the banded strength of the Lodge defends him, and the esteem and love of all hearts are secured unto him, so long as he remains faithful to his trust."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"FRIENDLY ADVICE. 27 THE LAMB. In our paragraph upon the Apron, in a preceding page, we remarked that the most tender and beautiful thought connected with its symbolism is, that the Masonic Apron is made of lamb-skin alone. This emblem of innocence is so peculiarly appropriate, that even the Messiah himself condescended to represent his own spotless nature under the figure of a Lamb. One of the older prophets prefigures his death in the words, \"He was led like a lamb to the slaughter.\" There is no passage in the Bible more affecting than this. In con- templating the Masonic emblem, the Lamb, the mind is suspended in solemn rapture between earth and heaven. A pacific temperament steals over the soul, and while we admire the tender and submissive nature of this gentle tenant of the field, we are taught what must be our own character if we would attain to that perfection of which Freemasonry teaches. Thus the very clothing of the Freemason, like the symbolical garments which covered the Priest under the typical law, is suggestive of the highest graces and virtues of our profession. FRIENDLY ADVICE. An old author proffers some ad- vice to gentlemen who may be inclined to become Ma- sons, of which the following is a synopsis : \"When you intend to become a Freemason, go with your friend to the hall where the Lodge is held, and examine the Char- ter or Warrant under which the Lodge is held. See that it is written or printed on parchment, signed by some Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, Grand Wardens, and Grand Secretary, and sealed with the Grand Lodge Seal; appointing certain persons named therein, with their successors, to be Master and Wardens ; authorizing them to congregate and hold a Lodge, and therein make"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. and admit Freemasons according to ancient custom. Then call for the By-Laws, and having seriously perused them, consider whether your natural disposition will in- cline you to be conformable to them. Next call for the List of Members, where you may find the names of some of your most intimate and esteemed friends, and perhaps the names of some you would not wish to associate with. If these researches prove agreeable, you may then ven- ture to sign a petition for initiation, lay down your de- posit-money, and await with patience the result.\" THE THIRD SECTION. THE Third Section of the Entered Apprentice's Lec- ture presents full details of the organization, fitting up, and history of the Lodge. The greater part of it is exoteric, and as such, may be explained to any inquirer, though even those passages that seem to have the least mystery about them are parts of the unwritten history of the Order, and can only be perfectly understood by the initiated. CONSTITUTION OF THE LODGE. To avoid those ir- regularities which would result upon the indiscriminate meetings of Masons, and the unrestricted working up of materials into the Lodge, it has been wisely ordained that no assemblage of the Craft can be opened with Masonic form, unless the presiding officer shall be fur- nished with a charter or warrant from the Grand Lodge possessing jurisdiction, empowering such an act. This is the source of temporal authority, and suggests a care- ful attention to forms. In addition to this, there must likewise be a copy of the Holy Scriptures. This is the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ANCIENT MEETING-PLACES. 29 source of Divine authority, and suggests a careful atten- tion to principles. With this copy, there must be -the essential accompaniments of the Square and Compass, admonishing the circle of laborers of the necessity of squaring their actions and circumscribing their passions. This suggests a careful attention to self-discipline, with- out which the workings of Freemasonry were as a sound- ing brass and a tinkling cymbal. Not less than seven members constitute a Lodge in this degree, and any assemblage not in accordance with all the requirements upon this page, that ventures to open a Lodge in Masonic form, is clandestine, and comes under the ban of the Craft universal. ANCIENT MEETING-PLACES. In days of old, the meet- ings of the Masonic Craft were held upon the summits of hills, or in crypts at their bases. This was for pur- poses of seclusion, which is essential to the Masonic work. Hills and dales were accounted sacred places; men thought themselves nearer God there than else- where. The law was given to Moses upon a mountain summit, nine thousand feet high. Some of the most affecting scenes between King Solomon and his builders occurred in the crypts beneath Mounts Moriah and Sion. The great sacrifice for sin, which terminated the Mosaic dispensation of rites and ceremonies, occurred upon Cal- vary, which is a part of the mountain range on which the city of Jerusalem stands. In modern times an attempt is made to express this symbolism by holding Lodge-meetings in the highest apartments of an edifice. Then there is nothing inter- venes between the covering of the Lodge on which heavenly bodies are depictured and the great canopy"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"SO THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. alluded to below, in which the heavenly bodies shine. No eyes look down upon the Mason-work but the eyes of angels deputed as ministering spirits to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation, and the All-seeing Eye, which pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart. EXTENT OF THE LODGE. The limits of the mystical Lodge are the cardinal points; nothing less will satisfy the expansive nature of the principles inculcated in this system. The apartment in which Masons assemble is symbolical of the universe, illimitable on every side, the proper temple of Deity, whose center is every- where, whose circumference is nowhere. To an entering Mason, it is the world iri miniature. \"Wherever man is tracing The weary ways of care, 'Midst arid deserts pacing, Or land of balmy air. We surely know each other; And with our words of cheer, The Brother hails his Brother, And hope wings lightly there.

SUPPORTS OF THE LODGE. The three foundation-stones upon which the structure of speculative Masonry was originally laid were entitled Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty. These were well named: for there was Wisdom to conceive the plan above all others practical; there was Strength to execute the plan above all others com- plicated and laborious; and there was Beauty to adorn the plan above all others capable of receiving the ele- gancies of thought. It were almost superfluous to com- ment upon these three words, Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty. \"Happy,\" said the wisest of men, \"is the man that findeth wisdom better than silver and gold, more precious than rubies. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\" \"In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon and said, Ask what I shall give thee; and Solomon said, Give thy servant an understanding heart.\" Let those who deny that Wisdom is evinced in the struc- ture of Freemasonry, explain, if they can, the exceeding Strength with which it has defied the influences of time and the oppositions of evil men. Let them explain the Beauty with which it stands before the world, the most perfect specimen of moral architecture extant, the most popular institution, the most highly respected in its membership, and the only esoterical system upon earth that has not yielded to the prying eyes of an inquisitive age."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"82 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. COVERING OF THE LODGE. In a preceding paragraph allusion is made to the fact that Lodges seek an upper chamber for their places of assemblage, so that there may be nothing interposed between them and the celestial con- cave, save their own ceiling, upon which are figured the heavenly bodies. In the symbolisms of the Masonic in- stitution, the covering of the Lodge is the starry-decked canopy, the nearest representation of the heavenly home beyond which is afforded in this life. Every object in a Mason's Lodge points to this. The hopes, watered and fed by the inculcations of the lectures, will have their fruition only in this. To the happy land, veiled by the resplendent curtain above, he strives to approach by a Ladder, seen by the sleeper upon Bethel's pillar, when in his lonely slumber God vouchsafed to him a vision. The assent by grades agrees with our own consciousness of weakness. There are many steps, intentionally made short and easy, to conform to human weakness, and every meeting of the Lodge affords us new encouragement to advance along the ascending way. Three of the steps, Faith, Hope, and Charity, are more distinctly marked than the others; and happy the man who places his feet successively upon them. Firmly planted upon the third, the canopy of heaven is not far distant, which being drawn aside by an angel's hand, the flight is ended, the aspirant has his reward ! FURNITURE OF THE LODGE. In subsequent pages of this volume, much space is devoted to the Furniture of the Sanctuary in the wilderness and that of the Tem- ple of Solomon. These were elaborate, costly, and em- blematical of all the purposes of the Mosaic dispensation The Furniture of the Masonic Lodge is more simple, yet"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"ORNAMENTS OF THE LODGE. 33 equally expressive it is the Holy Bible, Square, and Compass. In the first section of this Lecture these objects are merely described as emblems, but in the present connection they have a higher meaning. The precepts and examples contained in the volume thus used to furnish the Lodge are held in highest veneration. He who esteems them not, is ignorant and unworthy of our companionship. It is at once a guide through the present world and a passport to that which is to come. A terrible denunciation has been threatened to him who shall add to or diminish from the matter which the finger of God has placed there. It is dedicated to God in the threefold division of the Masonic Furniture. The Square will have ample elucidation in other por- tions of this volume ; and it only needs here to say, that, in the proper distribution of the Lodge Furniture, it is dedicated to the Master of the Lodge, as the Compass is to the Members: the Square teaching official responsi- bility, the Compass individual regulation of desires and due circumspection of passions. ORNAMENTS OF THE LODGE. As one of the three prin- cipal supports of the Lodge is termed Beauty, it is an- alogous to this that there should be Ornaments of the Lodge. These are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Skirting that surrounds the Pavement, and the Star in its center. These, like all other Masonic objects, are emblematical of moral and religious instructions. It has already been said that the apartment in which Masons assemble represents the moral universe; the very floor of it suggests the course of human life, checkered with good and evil. One who enters it is reminded, in that epitome of his own career, of the vicissitudes that are 3"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"j! THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. both before \"him and behind him. If he is in a condition of distress, he derives comfort from the reflection that he is surrounded with white squares; if in a condition of prosperity, he is taught to be humble, in view of the darker passages of life, to which his very next step may expose him. The Border, or Skirting, is an emblem full of hope to those who trust, as all Masons profess to do, in God; it prefigures the blessings that are derived from a steady dependence upon Divine Providence, which has its refer- ence in the Star that gleams in the center. To such of the Craft as blend their hopes of bliss in Jesus, the Son of God, this combination of emblems suggests the sub- limest aspirations. LIGHTS OF THE LODGE. The emblems representing the sources of Masonic light, or rather the mediums through which Masonic instruction is directly conveyed to the membership, are called Lights. They represent the Master and the two Wardens, who are the windows through which the lights of tradition, revelation, and the Grand Lodge having jurisdiction, can react the minds of the Craft. This is but an extended reference of the thought conveyed in our elucidation of the Lesser Lights in a preceding page. The situation of these lights cor- responding with those of the principal officers of the Lodge, refers the mind to traditions of the Tabernacle and the Temple, which are esoteric ; also to the course of the sun through the heavens. JEWELS or THE LODGE. By the term Jewel, we imply whatever is esteemed most precious among us, and dis- played as such to represent the abounding wealth of the Institution. Morality, Equality, and Rectitude of Life,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"JEWELS OF THE LODGE. 35 for instance, are three moral treasures, which have their emblems in the Square, the Level, and the Plumb. The rude material in the quarry of human life, though in- crusted with many excrescences, is yet precious as afford- ing us objects for our moral work, and this is represented by the Rough Ashlar. The same material, when fitted by Divine Grace and the practice of all virtues for the Temple above, is typified by the Perfect Ashlar; while the Book of God, read in nature and revelation, from which we derive all necessary degree instruction while upon earth, is represented by the Trestle-board. These three symbols are happily selected and happily named Jewels.

SITUATION OF THE LODGE. The Lodge is situated due east and west. All knowledge emanated from the east. Mankind originally emigrated from the east. The He- brews used the word East to describe all the countries or provinces lying around and beyond the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, or east or north-east of Judea. The expres- sion in Genesis, \"from the east/' denotes the country east or south-east of Mount Ararat. In traveling from the foot of that mountain to the plain of Shinar, the de- scendants of Noah would pass southerly on the eastern side of the mountains of Media till they came opposite"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"DEDICATION OF THE LODGE. 37 to Shinar, or to a point north-east of Babylon, from which, by a direct western course, they would pass into Assyria and the plain of Shinar. This is said to be the usual caravan route to this day. The Tabernacle in the Wilderness was set east and west; so was the Temple of Solomon. The walls for- merly inclosing that edifice are proofs of this, corre- sponding in their present direction with the cardinal points. The miraculous blast by which the Red Sea was opened before the feet of the Israelitish host, blew from the east. The bodies of the Masonic dead are buried due east and west. \"DEDICATION OF THE LODGE. While the central figure in the Lodge, the Holy Scriptures, is dedicated to Him from whom it came, the Lodge itself, with all its furni- ture, surroundings, and labors, is dedicated to one of two Sainted Patrons of Masonry, men who in their day ex- emplified the higher graces taught in the lectures Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. The elder of these was sent from. God to announce the coming of Jesus Christ. The other was called, by the commanding voice of Jesus, to leave the humble avoca- tion in which he had been reared, and go out into the world as an evangelist. Whatever virtues of courage, perseverance, obedience to God's Word, and unswerving fidelity that either of these Masonic patrons displayed, is adopted among the treasures of the Lodge. It mat- ters not whether the apocryphal statements which make these men to have been Masons are true or false, it is enough to know that their moral labors were our moral labors, their victories over sin were our victories, and the bright world gained by their perseverance in a good"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"38 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. cause is the same wherever the Supreme Architect pre- sides, and where there are \"many mansions\" remaining for us. In the mean time, it is safe to aver that no deed whose character would have prevented either of these, two men from engaging in it, is suitable to us, who have dedicated our Lodge and its labors to them. TENETS OF MASONRY. It is but the summing up of what has already been repeatedly, intimated in these pages, to say that the tenets of Masonry are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. Being so great a family of men, of all countries arid conditions, there is no cement would hold together such a band save that of Love. Being mutually interested in each other's welfare, it re- quires no law to compel us to look after the wants of such of the band as are sick, solitary, or in distress. The grand aim of the institution is best expressed in the charge given to the members, \" to soothe the unhappy, sympathize with their misfortunes, compassionate th^ir miseries, and, as far as in us lies, restore peace to their troubled minds.\" Our friendships are formed and our connections established upon this basis. The first and greatest lesson communicated to each initiate is Tntih, to be a good man and true; true to God, true to the institution, true to his country, true to himself. Hypocrisy and deceit are abhorrent to the good Mason. The volume upon our altar is the Book of Truth. One reason for the peculiarly strong engage- ments under which the initiate is placed to preserve the essential merits of Freemasonry is, that by his fidelity in this lesser trust, the brethren may judge of his ability to hold fast the truth in all the greater relations of life and of eternity."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CARDINAL VIRTUES OF MASONRY. 39 CARDINAL VIRTUES OF MASONRY. The distinction be- tween the tenets and the virtues of Masonry is barely sufficient to make an easy grade in the moral assent. Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice are judi- cious selections from those classes cf merits so abund- antly developed in the Scriptures. It is both our duty and our happiness, our labor and our reward, to culti- vate Temperance; the want of it unfits the initiate for usefulness and honor among the Craft, and renders him liable to the worst indiscretions. That mental stability which sustains with manly composure the evils of life, and enables a man to resist every proposal to do wrong, is Fortitude. Prudence stands at the helm, while For- titude buffets the tempest, and thus the voyage is made secure. \" If thou faint in the day of adversity,\" said our First Grand Master, \" thy strength is small ; the prudent man dealeth with knowledge, but the fool layeth open his folly.\" One of the most earnest of Evangelists said, \"Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.\" As the three -virtues above named re- late to our self-government, and the usefulness accruing therefrom, Justice, the last of the four, advises us in our dealings with others. The Lord, speaking through Moses, admonished his people in the wilderness: u That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live;\" and he promises that \"the just shall live by faith.\" - MASONIC SERVICE. The manner of Masonic service is finely represented by the emblems of chalk, charcoal, and clay, the last in this section. From the lessons of antiquity we derive instruction in every step up the mys- tic Ladder. At this point we may know that the char-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"40 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. acteristics of our ancient brethren in their relations to their Masters were freedom, fervency, and zeal. Their freedom of service was manifest by night as by day, and they gave off their good works as generously as the rose- leaf its odor. Their fervency of service was like that of the meridian sun itself. Their zeal emulated that of the fertile soil, which in the most inclement season is pre- paring itself, through the hidden agencies of nature, for the work of production. Without such manner of service the great Temple could not have been completed in one ordinary generation. It was because heart and soul were thrown into the handiwork, that such a piece of perfection was begun and finished within the lifetime of a child. God was honored, not only in the work, but in the manner of it, and for thousands of years the story of the great Temple has perpetuated the freedom, fer- vency, and zeal of its builders. CONCLUDING REMARKS UPON THE SCRIPTURES. The value of the Scriptures and the duty of perusing them appear from many considerations. We may estimate tho character and tendency of Divine revelation by contrast- ing the condition of countries where its true light shin- eth with that of other countries to which its beams have not extended. The heathen world is large enough, surely, for experiment. In many of its territories the richest blessings of sun and soil are enjoyed in abundance, and there external nature presents itself in its stateliest and loveliest forms; but where are the beauties of holiness? where the fruits and flowers of moral culture? Or if these are disparaged in comparison with intellectual stature and idolized genius, where are the distinguished philosophers and orators, historians and poets of pagan"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE SCRIPTURES. 41 communities? Amidst numberless diversities of condi- tion, they seem to have only this in common to explain their wretchedness, that they want those oracles of God which have been committed unto us ; and the conclusions appear fairly deducible that it is, in the absence of the Scriptures, the people are there destroyed for lack of knowledge ; that spiritual ignorance, in addition to its proper maladies, has there entailed civil and mental prostration; and that scoffers in our native land owe to the emancipating influence of God's Word that very freedom of thinking which, with ungrateful and impious hand, they wield for the overthrow of its doctrines and institutions. .If we confine our attention to those countries which possess the Word of God, a comparison between that portion of the community by whom the Scriptures are perused, and that portion by whom they are neglected, will conduct us to a like conclusion. No doubt external propriety may, in many instances, be promoted by the simple circumstance of dwelling among Christians who are \"living epistles of Jesus Christ, known and read of all men;\" and it is not less certain that many may con- sult the records of truth, and yet hold the truth in un- righteousness. But these apparent exceptions do not invalidate the general and incontestible fact that the classes most conversant with God's Word are most dis- tinguished for the graces which it inculcates ; while they who consort with thieves, and partake with adulterers, ^ho give their mouth to evil, and frame deceit with their tongue, are the wicked, who hate instruction and cast God's Word behind them. These thoughts, from the pen of a learned divine, are"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"42 THE ENTERED APPRENTICE. applicable to Masonry, a system founded upon the Bible and dependent upon the revealed Word of God for all its virtuous principles and inculcations. The effects marked above, as resulting upon the free spread of the Scriptures, are also manifest upon the op- erations of Freemasonry. Wherever a well-conducted Lodge is planted, its membership being chosen by the cautionary landmarks of the institution, and governed by its moral and spiritual code of laws, a general improve- ment is visible throughout the community. The vices of theft, debauchery, intemperance, profanity, Sabbath- breaking, and irreligion are much lessened, while the positive virtues of charity, self-control, and attention to religious duties are proportionally advanced. This phe- nomenon is not apparent upon the operations of any other society, within our knowledge, outside of the Church; and were there no other evidences of the merits of this ancient institution, this, that it. produces many of the best fruits of the Bible, would be sufficient to recommend it to all thoughtful persons."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE FELLOW CRAFT."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE FELLOW CRAFT.

THE FIRST SECTION. THE THEORY OF THE DEGREE OF FELLOW CRAFT. THE Degree of Fellow Craft represents the Entered Apprentice complete. It is not merely the second grade in the series; all that is to follow does not express so great an advance from the Degree of Fellow Craft, as that of the Fellow Craft is from the Entered Apprentice. The candidate is no longer a beginner, working without wages, forbidden to look into the plans and drawings of the work, excluded from consultations, without a foun- dation, but a Fellow-workman with the best; paid an honest stipend, invited to give counsel upon questions of architectural difficulty, and assisted to build up a rep- utation, in which all the Craft will take a brotherly in- terest. As, therefore, large privileges are conferred upon the Fellow Craft, so heavier responsibilities accumulate upon him. Covenants of power restrain him, duties are en- joined upon him, which\" require industrious application of the best lessons learned in tho preceding grade ; and, (45)"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"46 THE FELLOW CRAFT. above all, he is taught to reverence the name of Him from whom cometh every good and every perfect gift. THE ALTAR. The name of the Altar erected by Moses to commemorate his victory over the Amalekites at Rep- hidim, was Jehovah-nissi, signifying \"the Lord, my Ban- ner.\" This title is equally appropriate to the Masonic Altar. \"The Lord is the banner,\" or standard, of the institution in a peculiar sense; and the Altar, which is the most conspicuous object in the Lodge, is used to up- hold His Word before the eyes of the Craft. According to the Mosaic code, \" whatsoever touched the Altar must be holy;\" and this, again, applies with great force to the Masonic system, whose offerings are the most sound gifts in the power of man to bestow. The poet says: \"Upon the sacred Altar lies, Ah ! many a precious sacrifice, Made by these working men ; The passions curbed, the lusts restrained, And hands with human gore unstained, And hearts from envy clean.\" All contained in the Masonic covenants, whether af- firmative or negative, whether in the nature of duties or restrictions, are so many sacrifices made for God and in the name of God. He alone who can communicate saving efficacy to any means of doing good, has com- manded his blessing from on high upon the sacrifices made on the Masonic Altar, and so may he ever do! PRAYER. The view of the Masonic Altar always sug- gests Prayer as well as sacrifice. The introduction of Prayer as an essential portion of the Masonic drama is so general, that the Verbal Landmark declares, \"No"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"47 man should ever enter upon any great and important undertaking without first invoking the blessings of Deity.\" Prayer, as understood in the Masonic theory, is the application of want to Him who only can relieve it; the voice of sin to Him who only can pa'rdon it. It is the urgency of poverty, the prostration of humility, the fervency of penitence, the confidence of trust. It is not eloquence, but earnestness; not the definition of helplessness, but the feeling of it ; not figures of speech, but compunction of soul. It is the \" Lord save us, we perish,\" of Peter the cry of faith to the ear of mercy. Adoration is the noblest employment of created beings; confession the natural language of guilty creatures; grat- itude the spontaneous expression of pardoned sinners. Prayer is desire. It is not a conception of the mind, nor a mere effort of the intellect, nor an act of the memory; but an elevation of the soul toward its Maker, a pressing sense of our own ignorance and infirmity, a ^consciousness of the perfection of God, of his readiness to hear, of his power to help, of his willingness to save. It is not an emotion produced in the senses, nor an effort wrought in the imagination ; but a determination of the will, an effusion of the heart. Prayer is the guide to self-knowledge, by prompting us to look after our sins, in order to pray against them; a motive to vigilance, by teaching us to guard against those sins which, through self-examination, we have been enabled to detect. Prayer is an act both of the understanding and of the heart. The understanding must apply itself to the knowledge of the divine perfections, or the heart will not be led to the adoration of them. It would not be"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"48 THE FELLOW CRAFT. a reasonable service were the mind excluded. It must be rational worship, or the human worshiper would not bring to the service the distinguishing faculty of his na- ture, which is reason. It must be spiritual worship, or it would want the distinctive quality to make it accept- able to Him who has declared that he will be worshiped Jn spirit and in truth. Prayer is a privilege with which God has favored us, and a necessary part of that obedience which he has required of us to \"pray without ceasing; in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, letting our requests be made known unto God.\" THE SQUARE. In all languages, the idea Masonically conveyed by this emblem has an expression. The poet has done for the Masonic Order what was desired, in the following lines: We meet upon the Level and we part upon the Square; What words of precious meaning those words Masonic are! Come, let us contemplate them, they are worthy of a thought, Tu the very soul of Masonry those precious words are wrought. We meet upon the Level, though from every station come, The rich man from his mansion, and the poor man from his home : For the one must leave his greatness outside the Mason's door, While the other finds his level upon the checkered floor. We part upon the Square, for the world must have its due; We mingle with the multitude, a faithful band and true^ But the influence of our gatherings in Masonry is green; And we long upon the Level to renew the happy scene. There's a world where all are equal ; we are hurrying toward it fast: We tihall meet upon the Level there, when the gates of death ars pass'd ; We shall stand before the Orient, and our Master will be there, To try the blocks we offer with his own unerring Square."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"PRAYER. 49 We shall meet upon the Level there, but never thence depart; There 's a Mansion 't is all ready for each trusting, faithful heart ; There's a Mansion and a welcome, and a multitude is there, Who have met upon the Level, and been tried upon the Square. Let us meet upon the Level, then, while laboring patient here; Let us meet and let us labor, though the labor be severe; Already in the western sky the signs bid us prepare To gather up our Working Tools, and part upon the Square. Hands round, ye faithful Masons, in the bright, fraternal chain : We part upon the Square below to meet in heaven again; what words of precious meaning those words Masonic are We meet upon the Level, and we part upon the Square !

Uniting in the grand design, let us be happy in ourselves, and endeavor to contribute to the happiness of others. Let us promote the useful arts, and by them mark our supe- riority and distinction. Let us cultivate the moral vir- tues, and improve in all that is good and amiable. Let the genius of Masonry preside over our conduct, and under its sovereign sway let us act with becoming dig- nity.

To assist him in a task in which so many fail, the Level is presented to him, and its emblematical meaning expounded. He is admonished that our entrance upon earth, as well as our exit, is humble; that the inclemencies of life equally afflict us; that the baleful passions of human nature know no dis- tinctions of rank; that sorrow, sickness, disease, and mental afflictions are equally distributed; that, in truth, all mankind do \"stand upon a Level,\" so far as their relations to the Author of their being is concerned. These thoughts are calculated to level our pride with the plane on which God has designed us to move. In the burial service of Masonry the -reference to the Level is exceedingly appropriate. In the installation ceremonies it is said : \" The Level demonstrates that we are descended from the same stock, partake of the same nature, and share the same hope; because a time will come, and the wisest know not how soon, when all distinctions but that of goodness will cease, and Death, the grand leveler of human greatness, reduce us to the same state.\" The remarks made upon the emblem of \"the right angle, horizontal, and perpendicular,\" upon a preceding page, may be used here. The qualifications necessary to form a worthy member of our Order are a wise philanthropy, pure morality, in- violable secrecy, and a taste for the polite arts. I. Our Philanthropy. An ancient maxim was that the whole world is, in effect, a great republic, of which every nation is a family, and every particular person a child. To revive and spread abroad this maxim, drawn"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE LEVEL. 51 from the nature of man, is one of the ends of our es- tablishment. We wish to unite all men of an agreeable humor and enlightened understanding, not only by the love of the polite arts, but still more by the great prin- ciples of virtue. From such a union the interests of the Fraternity become the interests of all mankind. From such every nation may draw solid knowledge, and all the subjects of different kingdoms may unite without jealousy, live without disorder, and mutually love one another without renouncing their country. Freemasonry instructs in our duty to the Supreme Architect of the universe, to our neighbors, and to ourselves. It instructs us to be peaceable citizens to the civil powers, and never to be concerned in plots and conspiracies against the well-being of the nations. It teaches truth, peace, and concord. It bids us open our ears to the cries of the unfortunate, and to extend our hands to them with the cup of consolation. It unites men of all nations in one affectionate band of brotherhood. It shows us that we are all upon a level, and that merit is the only just dis- tinction. It orders us to live within compass, and al- ways to act upon the square with the world and with one another. It is not gloomy, but cheerful. It forbids intemperance, but encourages rational mirth and innocent pleasure. In short, it is a superstructure fixed with solid firmness on the broad basis of moral and' social virtue. II. Our Morality. Sound morality is the second dis- position required in our society. Let a man's religion or mode of it be what it will,, we do not exclude him from the benefits and advantages of oar Order, provided he believes in the glorious Architect of heaven and earth,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"52 THE\" FELLOW CRAFT. and practices the sacred duties of morality. We are directed to expand our hearts with the most generous sentiments, to root out bigotry, and stop the cruel hand of persecution. We are bid to unite with virtuous men of the most distant countries and opposite opinions ; to unite with them in the firm and pleasing bond of fra- ternal love; to regard them with the truest affection. As a severe, cruel, gloomy, and unsociable philosophy disgusts men with virtue, we are desirous of rendering it amiable by the allurements of innocent pleasures, agreeable music, pure joy, and rational gayety. Our sen- timents are not what the profane world and ignorant vulgar imagine them to be; all the vices of the heart are banished from them, as well as irreligion, libertinism, ex- cess and debauchery. We banish from our Lodge every dispute which may tend to alter the tranquillity of the mind and gentleness of the manner, or to destroy those sentiments of friend- ship and that perfect harmony to be found only in the retrenching all indecent excesses and discordant pas- sions. The obligations that are laid upon us are to protect 3ur brethren by our authority, to enlighten them by our understanding, to edify them by our virtues, to sacrifice every personal resentment toward them, and diligently to seek for every thing that will best contribute to the peacej concord, and credit of our society. III. Our Secrecy. We have secrets among us. They compose a language sometimes mute and sometimes very eloquent, to be communicated at the greatest distance, and to know our brethren by, let their country or their language be what it may. What has scarcely happened"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE LEVEL. 53 to any other society has happened to us. Our Lodges have been established in and are now spread over all polite nations, and yet among so great a multitude of men, no brother has ever yet betrayed our secrets. Dis- positions the most volatile, the most indiscreet, and the least trained up to secrecy, learn this great science as soon as they enter among us. So great an empire over the mind has this idea of brotherly union ! This invio- lable secrecy powerfully contributes to link together the subjects of different kingdoms, and to facilitate and ren- der mutual between them the communication of benefits. We have many examples in the annals of our Order of brethren traveling into foreign parts, and, finding themselves distressed, have made themselves known to our Lodges and received all needful assistance. We are connected by solemn promises : if any one should fail in the solemn promises that connect us, there is no greater punishment than the remorse of conscience, the infamy of perfidy, and expulsion from our society. To prevent the abuses that befell the fraternities of Greece and Egypt, women are excluded from our Order. It is not that we do not pay a natural and due regard to that most beauteous part of the creation, or that we are unjust enough to look upon them as incapable of secrecy, but because their presence might insensibly alter the purity of our maxims and our manners. We are afraid that Love would enter with them, and draw us to his flowery, tempting paths, where Jealousy would dif- fuse his venom -through our hearts, and from affectionate brethren transform us into implacable rivals. IV. Our Taste for the Polite Arts.

These improve the heart as much as the understanding. They moderate the selfish affections, sweeten and harmonize the temper, and the better fit men for social happiness, that happiness which Freemasonry most zealously en- deavors to promote. THE PLUMB. It only needs a glance at a \" bowed and tottering wall,\" or a building inclining sensibly from the perpendicular, or, what is more common and far more painful, a human being of either sex, wandering from the paths of rectitude, to learn the lesson of this emblem. The Plumb-line seems designed by the Author of virtue to teach us what safety there is in truth. Who wears the Plumb, behold how true His words and walk ! and could we view The chambers of his soul, Each thought enshrined, so pure, so good, By the stern line of rectitude, Points upward to the goal. The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations; to hold the scale of justice in equal poise; to observe the just medium between intemperance and pleasure, and to make our passions and prejudices coincide with the line of our duty. It is the interior of moral rectitude, teaching us to avoid dissimulation in conversation and action, and to direct our paths to the path which leads to immortality. Read here the remarks upon a previous page relative to the emblem of \"the right angle, the horizontal, and the perpendicular.\" RECEPTION ON THE SQUARE.

All its analogies relate to labor and pil- grimage. The Fellow Crafts came from Phoenicia to erect the temples and other stately edifices of Solomon ; we en- gage to erect more stately edifices for our King \"the King of kings and Lord of lords.\" No effort is spared to impress upon the Fellow Crafts that \"they should eat no man's bread for naught;\" and among r the methods em- ployed is the application of the Square. To try the works of every Mason, the Square is presented as the probation of his life, proving whether his works are reg- ular and uniform or not. Who wears the Square upon his breast^ Does in the sight of God attest, And in the face of man, That all his actions will compare With the Divine, the unerring Square, That squares great virtue's plan. Masons should be of one principle and one rank with- out the distinctions of pride and pageantry; intimating that from high to low the minds of Masons should be inclined to good works, above which no man stands ex- alted by his fortune. THE ATTENTIVE EAR, THE INSTRUCTIVE TONGUE, THE FAITHFUL BKEAST. The use of these three emblems is so natural as scarcely to require comment. Information upon all the inculcations of Masonry is chiefly acquired through the attentive ear, both the eye and the hand being subordinate to that.

Strange that any men, too careless to moralize, or too stupid to discern, should enter the porch of Masonry only to fall asleep in the arms of indolence and dullness. It is a marked truth in the operations of Masonry, that he who has the instructive tongue is ever ready to communicate the science to those entitled to receive it. The genius that conducted him through the mystic temple inspired him with all the virtues of the institution^ The annals of the Order are full of the names of those whose ready and silvery tongue found no subjects more worthy to be expatiated upon than those connected with Free- masonry. The third of this splendid trio is the faithful breast. Of all societies, this has been the most distinguished for the inviolable secrecy which its members have preserved. Neither the thunders of the Vatican, nor the tortures of the Inquisition, nor the fierce demands of a depraved public opinion, have succeeded in extorting from the faithful breast those things so solemnly deposited there. HOPE. We have in no author so .good a definition of this emblem as that by the Apostle Paul, in his declara- tion \"that by two immutable things, in which it was im- possible for God to lie, [referring to his promise and his oath^\\ we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold of the hope set before us, which hope we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.\" The same eloquent writer in another passage declares: \"We are saved by hope; if we hope for that which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\" The Psalmist has declared, \" Happy is he whose hope is in the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"JACHIN AND BOAZ. 57 Lord his God.\" His son, the wise King, adds: \"The righteous hath hope in his death.\" The Prophet Joel avers \" the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.\" As we sit in our respective places in the Lodge, arid look upon the open Word in the midst, we may deem that there is a treasury of hopes contained in that book, both for this world and that which is to come. The dealings of God with his ancient people afford a sure foundation that he who is unchangeable in justice, good- ness, and mercy, can not fail to render to those who, by patient continuance in well-doing, shall merit his favor, all needed blessings. These are the inculcations of the emblem of Hope. JACHIN AND BOAZ. It can not be doubted that the most striking and attractive objects to a person approach- ing the Temple up Mount Moriah were the brazen Pil- lars upon the east. Whether to the stranger, who only considered them as architectural ornaments, or to the in- formed Israelite, who read in their names, dimensions, cavities, and ornaments many of the most useful incul- cations in his religious code, these Pillars were the first to catch the eye and the last to fade upon the memory. The height of these transcendent spires is variously given at eighteen and thirty-five cubits : the latter is the more likely, whether we estimate the due proportion between the diameter four cubits, or the magnitude of the great building before which they stood. Nothing less than thirty-five cubits will answer the requirements of the Fellow Craft's lecture, which sets the proportions between the heights and diameters of pillars at seven, eight, nine, ten, and ten for the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":">8 THE FELLOW CRAFT. and Composite Orders respectively. As the particular order of architecture used in these Pillars is not given, we can not designate the exact proportion applicable; but to none of them will a height of eighteen cubits apply. The names of these grand and awe-inspiring objects are full of meaning to a Freemason. The right Pillar that is, the one on the south side of the door of entrance was called \" Jachin;\" literally, \"He will establish.\" The left Pillar that is, the one on the north side of the door of entrance was called \"Boaz;\" literally, \"In it is power.\" Uniting the two definitions into one, the allu- sion is to the Divine promise that in strength God would perpetually establish the kingdom of Israel in the family of David. This, in the Masonic system, implies the en- durance and strength of our institution, which at the end of its three thousand years of history stands more firmly upon its basis than ever before. The cavity and ornaments of the Pillars are equally emblematical. Upon the chapiters were nets of checker- work, wreaths of chain-work, seven upon each chapiter, also lily-work, and two hundred pomegranates in rows, upon each. To the instructed Israelite passing between the Pillars, these symbols betokened the great lessons of unity, peace, and plenty, and taught him that the spirit of unity produces peace, and that the combination of unity . and peace is divinely blessed to plenty. The globes or pommels upon the chapiters, with their proper scientific teachings, conveyed also the Masonic meaning, expressed upon a previous page, that the charities of Freemasons should be as boundless as the spheres.

Upon the Angle of 90 the Fellow Craft, metaphorically, is tried, and happy he whose life and conduct shall bear so rigid a test. A very small deviation from this angle, though it may not be perceptible to man, is .distinctly so to God, who is our Divine Master, and is to reward us not merely according to the amount of our works, but according to the accuracy with which they adapt them- selves to the angle he has traced out for us. It may be that the heathen and the uncultivated denizens of the isles are not prescribed by an Angle so broad as that which is presented to us. God is merciful, and will not place upon any person more responsibilities than he has moral strength to bear; but to us who, in addition to the light of civilization, the Bible and Christianity have the brilliancy of Freemasonry shining within our souls, it is hard to see what excuse we can present our Heav- enly Master in the Judgement-day for a ^deficiency in the angular propriety of our lives. The Angle of 90 is emphatically one of the working tools of our profession; let us see that it is not less so of our practice. THE SECOND SECTION.

Properly delivered, this is the most dramatic and beautiful ceremony yet treated upon in this volume. It fully justifies us in claiming for this grade of Masonry that it particularizes circum- stances of great importance to the Fraternity, and con- firms many of our traditional tenets and customs by sacred and profane record. There is a store of valuable knowledge developed from this lecture, founded on reason, tradition, and the Sacred Record, both enter- taining and instructive. OPERATIVE AND SPECULATIVE MASONRY. The fre- quent use in this volume of the terms \" Operative \" and \"Speculative\" requires an explanation. To the mem- bers of this institution was anciently given the erection of all great edifices. The secrets of architecture were then parts of the secrets of Freemasonry, and none could undertake a temple, a palace, or other grand erection, until he had passed the portals of the Masonic Lodge and acquired the scientific knowledge there treasured up. Then Operative and Speculative Masonry were blended; those who built the actual temple also built the moral one. But through the lapse of ages, the se- crets of operative architecture have been given out to the world, leaving only the mysteries of the moral build- ing. Speculative Masonry, therefore, contemplates in theory what the operative builder reduces to practice, and the tools of the workmen are only used as emblems in the construction of \" the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\" In this thought the following lines are conceived :"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE SEVENTH DAY OF THE WEEK. 61 Darkly hid beneath the quarry, Masons, many a true block lies ; Hands must shape and hands must carry, Ere the stone the Master prize.

THE SEVENTH DAY OF THE WEEK. As the Creator of all things has put it on record that he would have his creatures give the seventh day of each week wholly to him and his service, thus commemorating the great fact of the creation, this has been adopted among the land- marks of our institution. It is the oldest of all observ- ances, this day being consecrated in the first division of time after the creation. The Almighty Maker selected it for his own period of refreshment and rest after the completion of his labors, and we in like manner give the hours to bodily rest and the refreshment of the soul.

The title given to the Jewish day of rest was \"the Sabbath;\" it is from a Hebrew word signifying rest. Since the Christian era, the day of rest is called the Lord's Day, because it is now commemorative of Christ's resurrection from the dead; and there is thus connected with it an affectionate remembrance of the whole char- acter and offices of Him to whose service and glory it is to be devoted. Sunday was the name given by the heathens to the first day of the week, because it was the day on which they worshiped the sun, and this name,^ together with those of the other days of the week, has been continued to our times. The sanctification of one-seventh portion of time by man is regarded throughout the whole of the Old Testa- ment Scriptures as a fundamental principle of duty, and no sin, except perhaps idolatry, is threatened with heavier penalties than Sabbath-breaking. The Divine commandment which stands the fourth in the Decalogue, \" Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy,\" is founded on the fact that the seventh day was blessed and hallowed by God himself, and that he re- quires his creatures to keep it holy to him. This com- mandment is of universal and perpetual obligation. The object to be accomplished by the institution is general, and applies to all people every-where with like force. Wherever there is a human creature capable of contem- plating the character of the Supreme Being, of studying his revealed will, and of considering his own immortal destiny, this commandment requires him to consecrate at least one-seventh part of his time to these holy pur-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THREE, FIVE, AND SEVfiN. 63 poses. The terms of the commandment do not fix the precise day in order, except that it is to be every seventh day. Tn other words, it simply requires that after six days of labor, one day is to be given to rest. There is abundant evidence from history that the seventh day of the week has been observed from the earliest times as a day of rest; and the change from the seventh to the first day does not in any degree change or impair the obligation to sanctify a seventh portion of our time. So far from it, the sacredness and glory of the day are much increased by its association with that great event on which our hope of life and im- mortality entirely depends. It seems to be admitted, by intelligent men of every class and profession, that the observance of a w r eekly day of rest is as essential to our intellectual and physical as to our moral and spiritual nature. The simple rule as to the mode of observing the day seems to be this: that there should be a cheerful resting all the day' from such worldly employments and recrea- tions as may be lawful on other days, and the spending the whole time in the public or private worship of God, except so much as may be occupied by works of neces- sity or mercy. To test the propriety of any act or pur- suit on that day, it is only needful to inquire whether the doing of it will tend to advance us in holy exercises and affection, and in preparation for the heavenly rest, or whether it is an act of necessity which can not be post- poned without serious injury.

Scriptural history shows how frequently they were introduced in sacred events. \" There are three that bear record in heaven : the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.\" This passage expresses the whole theory of the Masonic trinity. The three principal officers of the Lodge, corresponding with the three original degrees in Masonry, are examples of the uses to which this number is applied. The number five is not less suggestive in the Masonic rituals. There are five orders in architecture that are recognized among Freemasons: the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite, of which the three central ones are most highly esteemed in speculative Masonry. There are five senses in human nature : hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, and tasting, of which the first three are so highly estimated in the Masonic system, that no person w r ho has lost any one of them can lawfully be made a Mason. Among the furniture of the sanctuary and the temple, there were five golden candlesticks on either side of the oracle. The number seven has even more numerous allusions in the rituals. There are seven liberal arts and sciences inculcated in the Masonic system ; viz. : grammar, rhet- oric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy, of which the fifth, generally, is most highly estimated. There are seven days in the w r eek; the seventh year was anciently directed to be a sabbath of rest for all things, and the law was directed to be read to the people.

The book of Revelations, the most symbolical series of writ- ings extant, embodies nearly all its mysteries under the number seven as seven churches, seven golden candle- sticks, seven stars, seven lamps representing the seven spirits, the book with seven seals, the seven kings, seven thunders, the dragon with seven heads and seven crowns, seven angels bringing seven plagues, and seven vials of wrath* In our lectures, perfection is likened to gold seven times purified in the fire. In the application of these numbers in the Fellow Craft's ritual, lengthy and beautiful discourses upon the Order in architecture and the seven liberal arts and sciences are delivered, which, being found in the Mon- itor, need no repetition here. THE EAR OF CORN. Much may be said of the ex- pressiveness of this emblem, suspended, in all Well-ar- ranged Lodges, over the Junior Warden's chair. As the contiguity of a fall of water to a field of standing corn gives vigor to the plant, so the graces of the Divine Spirit give nourishment to the good man's piety, and make it fruitful. The Scriptural light thrown upon this emblem is that in the eleventh chapter of Judges. Fifty- one years after the celebrated exploit of Gideon at the well Harod, the Ammonites came out of their deserts eastward, and invaded Palestine in great numbers. A part of them came up into Gilead and encamped at Aroer.

By this heroic deed the country was rid of its oppressors. On Jephthah's return home occurred that pathetic tragedy which has made the name of Jeph- thah's daughter immortal in prose and song. Shortly afterward the Ephraitnites, whose tribe was located on the opposite side of the river westward, taking bitter offense at Jephthah for slighting them in his call for soldiers, or, what is more likely, angry that they were omitted in the distribution of the spoils, crossed the river with a great army and threatened his destruction. Jephthah was in no .whit intimidated, but at once recalled his warriors from their homes, and defeated the Ephraim- ites. Resolved to punish them for their unprovoked assault, he sent portions of his army to the fords in their rear, and intercepting them, slew all who attempted to pass, to the number of forty-two thousand. This was a blow which that haughty tribe never forgot. As a measure for identifying the Ephraimites at the fords, an ear of corn was hung upon a branch and each traveler was requested to give its name. The proper word in Hebrew for an ear of corn is \" Shibboleth,\" so pronounced in the pure language. But the Ephraimites, having a patois of their own, were unable thus to express the first syllable. They called it \"Sibboleth,\" just as the Arabs pronounce the same word to the present day. Their defect of utterance was fatal to them, for every man who thus named the ear of corn was summarily dispatched. In relation to this singular transaction, which in the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE LETTER G. 67 vituals of the Fellow Craft plays a prominent part, a celebrated English writer of the last century says: \"The application which is made of certain words among Ma- sons is as a testimony of their retaining their original one uninfringed, and their first faith with the brother- hood uncorrupted. And to render their words and phrases more abstruse and secure, they selected such as by acceptation in the Scriptures or otherwise might puz- zle the ignorant by a double implication. Thus, ' Shib- boleth/ should we have adopted the Eleusonian mys- teries, would answer as an avowal of our profession, the word implying * ears of corn. 3 But taking its deriva- tive from the Greek tongue, it is equivalent to ' Colo lapidem/ implying that we retain and keep inviolate our obligations as the 'Jurimentum per jovem lapidem/ the most obligatory oath held among the heathens.\" THE LETTER G. A brother entering the Lodge while at work, has his attention turned first to the emblems upon the Altar, of which one is the immortal Word of God, and next to an object suspended over the Master's Chair, an emblem of the letter G. This is the initial let- ter of the name of Deity, that Being before whom Ma- sons of every degree bow and adore. The full bearing of this emblem is conveyed in the following lines : That Name ! I heard it at my mother's knee, When looking up, the dear, remembered face Beaming on mine, so fond, so tenderly, She prayed that GOD her little son would bless. That Name! I spoke it when I entered here, And bowed the knee, as man in worship must; From my heart's center, with sincerity, I cried aloud, \"In GOD is all my trust.\""},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"68 THE 'FELLOW CRAFT.

The earth abundantly yields them to the industrious laborer; from our mother's breast we pass to the yield- ing sources of the soil. The emblem of corn, implying all the nutritious fruits of the earth ; the emblem of wine, implying all that nature affords to gladden the heart, and the emblem of oz7, which to Oriental nations is quite as important as the others, represent nature's bounties, the wages of practical labor.

The spirit of this whole sec- tion is conveyed in the following lines : The sunbeams from the eastern sky Flash from yon blocks exalted high, And on their polished fronts proclaim The framer and the. builder's fame. Glowing beneath the fervid noon, Yon marble dares the southern sun; Yet tells that wall of fervid flame, The framer and the builder's fame.

Beneath the dewy night, the sky Lights up ten thousand lamps on high; Ten thousand lamps unite to name The framer and the builder's fame.

THE FIRST SECTION. THE THEORY OF THE DEGREE OF MASTER MASON. THE Degree of Master Mason is suggestive of gov- ernment over men. The Apprentice and the Fellow Craft draw the materials from quarry and forest, shape them, remove them to the places designed for them, and raise them to the wall: this is physical labor. All this requires a designing head, a draughtsman, and a superin- tendent, and this is the Master Mason. The same ne- cessity exists in Speculative or Moral Masonry. To the Master Mason were intrusted the secrets of architecture, plans, measurements, and estimates, the weight, tenacity, and durability of materials, and all that learning needful to transform rude stones and the trunks of trees into edifices that should be the wonder and de- light of the earth. With such transcendent privileges there was coupled a heavy burden of covenants, and he was expected to exemplify before his fellow-laborers every virtue and grace symbolized on the Trestle-Board of the Master Builder. (73)"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"74 THE MASTER MASON. A late writer has elegantly said : We have seen the type of man complete in moral worth and intellectual culture. What more is left? Communion with ^ his Maker. The mere knowledge of Deity is that of our august Creator, whom we are to reverence and in whom alone we are to put our trust. But we have not yet seen Him walking upon the earth and holding open com- munion with the sons of men. Man has not been enno- bled by personal contact with the All-Holy. Let us suppose three brethren, types respectively of moral, in- tellectual, and physical perfection, joined together in holy fellowship, which should make their very souls as one, might they not in mystic union call upon the great and sacred name of Deity and receive an answer to their prayer ? That such an idea did prevail, we have suffi- cient proof, and it is to this, rather than to any mere utilitarian views, that we are to look for the rule which, in a purely speculative institution, so sternly demands physical as well as moral and intellectual integrity. The Degree of Master Mason is a type of the com- munion of man with God. Long before the incarnation of that great Being was the hope entertained of seeing Him with mortal eyes, and no exertions were deemed too great to insure that consummation. With us these ideas are but a type, for we have that realization so longed for by the brethren of old. And yet, as a type, how interesting it is to look back upon their struggles to look forward into what is now so bright and clear !

These three degrees thus form a perfect and harmonious whole. THE COMPASS. The use of the Compass, whose beau- tiful allegory was explained in a preceding grade, is peculiarly adapted to the present Degree. Within its extreme points, when properly extended, are found the grand principles of Friendship, Morality, and Brotherly Love. No subject can more properly engage the atten- tion than the humane and generous feelings planted by nature in the human breast. Friendship is traced through the circle of private connections to the grand system of universal philanthropy, but the Brotherly Love so well known to the Masonic family is one of the purest emanations of earthly friendship. A community of sentiment and feeling creates a community of interest, cultivated and cherished by every brother. Morality is practical virtue, of which so much is said in the preceding degrees. It is the journey of Wisdom, pursuing and disseminating happiness. It is no cold speculation, but a living principle. Saint John, himself one of the purest exemplars of these three virtues, has left it on record, that if a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, lie is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen? Beloved, if God so loved us, ve ought also to love one another; and this command- ment have we from Him, That he who loveth God, love his brother also. So sings the Masonic lyrist : By one God created, by one Savior saved, By one Spirit lighted, with one mark engraved, We learn through the wisdom our spirits approve, To cherish the spirit of Brotherly Love."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"76 THE MASTER MASON.

Yes, yes, though the week may be long, it will end; Though the Temple be lofty, the key-stone will stand; And the Sabbath, blest day, every thought will remove, Save the memory fraternal of Brotherly Love. THE ALTAR. The sacrifices made upon the Masonic Altar are the bloodless offerings of the soul. David describes them when he says, \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, God, thou wilt not despise.\" These may be individual- ized as sacrifices of our own will, of feelings of contempt, anger, and hatred; of tale-bearing and indiscretion; of selfishness and the indulgence of our passions. Such are the offerings made upon the open Law and in front of the emblem of the letter G. Friendship, on wing etherial flying round, Stretches her arm to bless the hallowed ground; Humanity, well pleased, here takes her stand, Holding her daughter, Pity, by the hand; Here Charity, which soothed the widow's sigh, And wipes the dew-drop from the orphan's eye; Here stands Benevolence, whose large embrace Uncircumscribed takes in the human race; She sees each narrow tie, each private end, Indignant, Virtue's universal friend; Scorning each frantic zealot, bigot tool, She stamps on Masons' breasts her Golden Rule."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE TROWEL. 77 THE TROWEL.

So much has been said in other pages of this volume upon Charity, or more properly Love, that it would be superfluous to enlarge further upon this sub- ject. No one has so clearly defined it as the Apostle who so thoroughly experienced it, the Evangelist John. His soul was filled with this divine emanation when he wrote, \"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.\" \"We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.\" \"Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and truth.\" \"Brethren, let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God and honoreth God. He that loveth not, honoreth not God, for God is love.\" \"Breth- ren, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.\" Under the term \" Charity,\" the Apostle Paul, in a masterly summing-up of the subject, writes: \"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and though I have the gift of prophesy, and understand all mysteries"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"78 THE MASTER MASON. and all knowledge, and though I bestow all iny goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. And now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity, these three ; but the great- est of these is Charity.\" PRAYER. The posture of bended knees is often al- luded to in Scripture. Solomon kneeled down upon his knees before the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven. Ezra says, \"I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God.\" Daniel kneeled on his knees three times a day and prayed. Paul says, \"I bow my knees unto the Father.\" As an appropriate form of Lodge prayer, in w r hich Masons of all persuasions can unite without compromise of religious principle, the one entitled the Lord's Prayer is the most perfect: \"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we for- give our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.\" THE FOUNDATION-STONE. When the Spirit came to Jephthah, Animating his great heart, He arose, put on his armor, Girt his loins about to part; Bowed the knee, implored a blessing, Gave an earnest of his faith, Then, divinely-strung, departed, Set for victory or death."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE FIVE POINTS OF FELLOWSHIP. 79 If a rude, uncultured soldier Thus dre\\v wisdom from above, How should we, enlightened laborers, Children of the Sire of Love How should we, who know \" the wisdom, Gentle, pure, and peaceable,\" Make a prayerful preparation, That our work be square and full !

This section recites the historical tradition of the Order, and presents to view a picture of great moral sublimity. It recites the legend, the symbol- ical interpretation of which testifies our faith in the resur- rection of the body and the immortality of the soul; while it also exemplifies an instance of integrity and firmness seldom equaled, and never surpassed. THE FIVE POINTS OF FELLOWSHIP. The. old records succinctly declare that the Master Mason should not withdraw his hand from a sinking brother; that his foot should never halt in the pursuit of duty ; that his prayers should unceasingly ascend for the distressed; that his faithful heart should equally conceal the secrets and the faults of a brother.; and that approaching evil should be averted by a friendly admonition. The same thought is more elaborately conveyed in the following, from an author of the last generation : I. When the necessities of a brother call for my aid and support, I will be ever ready to lend him such assist- ance, to save him from sinking, as may not be detrimental to myself or connection, if I find him worthy thereof. II. Indolence shall not cause my footsteps to halt nor wrath turn them aside ; but, forgetting every selfish con- sideration, I will be swift of foot to serve, help, and ex- ecute benevolence to a fellow-creature in distress, and more particularly to a brother Mason. III. When I offer up my ejaculations to Almighty God, I will remember a brother's welfare as my own ; for as the voice of babes and sucklings ascends to the Throne of Grace, so most assuredly will the breathings of a fervent heart arise to the mansions of bliss, as our prayers are certainly required of one another."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE FIVE POINTS OF FELLOWSHIP. 81 IV. A brother's secrets, delivered to me as such, I will keep as I would my own ; as betraying that trust might be doing him the greatest injury he could sustain in this mortal life. Nay, it would be like the villainy of an as- sassin who lurks in darkness to stab his adversary when unarmed and least prepared to meet an enemy. V. A brother's character I will support in his absence as I would in his presence. I will not wrongfully revile him myself, nor will I suffer it to be done by others, if in my power to prevent it. Thus by the Five Points of Fellowship are we linked together in an indivisible chain of sincere affection, brotherly love, relief, and truth. Another and even more beautiful comment upon the Five Points of Fellowship is the following : I. When the calamities of our brother call for our aid, we should not withdraw the hand that might sustain him from sinking, but should render him those services which, while they do not encumber or injure our families or fortunes, charity and religion may dictate for the sav- ing of our fellow-creature. II. From which purpose indolence should not persuade the foot to halt, or wrath turn our steps out of the way; but, forgetting injuries and selfish feelings, and remember- ing that man was born for the aid of his generation and not for his own enjoyments only, but to do that which is good, we should be swift to have mercy, to save, to strengthen, and 'execute benevolence. III. As the good things of this life are partially dis- pensed, and some persons are opulent while others are in distress, such principles always enjoin a Mason, be he ever so poor, to testify his good-will toward his brother. 6"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"82 THE MASTER MASON, Riches alone do not allow the means of doing good. Virtue and benevolence are not confined to the walls of opulence. The rich man from his many talents is re- quired to make extensive works, under the principles of virtue. And yet poverty is no excuse for an omission of that exercise; for, as the cry of innocence .ascendeth up to heaven, as the voice of babes and sucklings reaches the throne of God, and as the breathings of a contrite heart are heard in heaven, so a Mason's prayers for the welfare of his brother are required of him. IV. The fourth principle is, never, to injure the -con- fidence of your brother by revealing his secrets, for perhaps that were to rob him of the guard that pro- tects bis property or his life. The tongue of a Mason should be without guile and void of offense, speaking truth with discretion, and keeping itself within the rule of judgment, maintaining a \"heart free of uncharitable- ness, locking up secrets, and communing in charity and love. V. As much is required of a Mason in the way of gifts as discretion may limit. Charity begins at home, but, like a fruitful olive-tree planted by the side of a fountain whose boughs overshoot the wall, so is charity. It spreads its arms abroad from the strength and opu- lence of its station, and lendeth its shade for the repose and relief of those who are gathered under its branches. Charity, when given with imprudence, is no longer a vir- tue; but when flowing from abundance, it is glorious as the beama of morning, in whose beauty thousands rejoice. When donations extorted by piety are detrimental to a man's family, they become sacrifices to superstition, and, like incense to idols, are disapproved by Heaven."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE BUOKEN COLUMN. 83 THE BROKEN COLUMN.

THE UNFINISHED TEMPLE. The Temple of Masonry is ever in course of construction, ever unfinished. Into its walls successive generations of the wise and good are built ; and while time lasts, and the end of all things is delayed, the moral structure is incomplete. But we need not fear its walls will crumble, or that the work will ever cease. The other societies of this world, em- pires, kingdoms, and commonwealths, being of less per- fect constitutions, have been of less permanent duration. Although men have busied themselves through all ages in forming and reforming them, in casting down and building up, yet still their labors have been vain. The reason was hear it and be wise, ye builders of the pres- ent day ! tliey daubed with uniempered mortar ; they ad- mitted into their structures the base, discordant, hetero- geneous materials of pride, ambition, selfishness, malice, guile, hypocrisies, envious and evil speaking, which Free- masonry rejects.

The Egyptian, the Babylonian, the Assyrian, the Per- sian Empires, the commonwealths of Athens, Sparta, and Rome, with many more of later date, where are they now? \"Fallen, fallen, fallen,\" the weeping voice of history replies. The meteors of our age, the gaze of the world, they rose, they blazed awhile on high, they burst and sunk beneath the horizon, to that place of oblivion where the pale ghosts of departed grandeur fly about in sad lamentations for their former glory. Such have been the changes and revolutions which, as a Fraternity, we have seen. From the bosom of the Lodge, seated upon an eminence, its foundations reach- ing the center and its summits the sky, we have beheld, as upon a turbulent ocean at an immense distance be- neath us, the states of this world alternately mounted up and cast down, as they have regarded or neglected the principles described above, while, supported by them, the sublime fabric of our constitution has remained un- shaken through ages. And thug supported it shall remain while the sun opens the day to gild its cloud-capped towers, or the moon leads in the night to checker its starry canopy.

THIS Section is chiefly devoted to the explanation of the hieroglyphical emblems peculiar to this Degree. As usually given, it presents many useful particulars rela- tive to King Solomon's Temple, a portion of which, in the present volume, are, for convenience sake, transferred to other pages. In the richness of its imagery, this Section resembles the Third Section of the Degree of Entered Apprentice. WISDOM, STRENGTH, AND BEAUTY. The emblem of the three Pillars in this section alludes to the three im- mortal artists who contrived, strengthened, and adorned the sacred Fane. Solomon, King of Israel, first in wis- dom, in wealth, in favor with God and man, stands as the Pillar of Wisdom. \" His wisdom excelled/' says the inspired historian, \"the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and He- man and Chalcor and Darda, the sons of Mahal. He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five, and he spoke of trees from the cedar tree, that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall ; he spoke also of beasts and of fowls and of creeping things and of fishes.\" This is all summed up in this passage: \"God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and large- ness of heart even as the sand that is upon the sea- shore.\" This was our Pillar of Wisdom. Our Pillar of Strength was Hiram, King of Phoenicia, a nation of architects and mariners, whose furnishing of skillful builders and choice materials gave to King Solo- mon all the support necessary for his undertaking."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"88 THE MASTER MASON. Our Pillar of Beauty was Hiram Abiff, whose singular proficiency in all the works of the goldsmith, the brass- founder, the dyer and weaver, the lapidary and the jew- eler, gave the desired impetus to the adorning of the edifice. THE COLUMNS AND PILASTERS. Our monitorial in- structor gives the due number of these outward parts of the edifice, by which the visitor from foreign nations, who was not permitted to approach the Temple nearer than the outer courts, could form an idea of the magni- tude and splendor of the interior. Of columns proper there were 1,453; of pilasters, 2,906. Upon other pages of this volume a description of the porch and the courts is given, from which we deduce the necessity of so many columns and pilasters in the building. In the same connection, the lectures of the Master's Degree compute the numbers of the workmen as follows : Grand Masters, 3; Masters, or overseers of the work, 3,300 ; Fellow Crafts, 80,000 ; Entered Apprentices, or bearers of burdens, 70,000. These were all classed and arranged by the wisdom of Solomon, that neither envy, discord, nor confusion were suffered to interrupt that universal peace and tranquillity which pervaded the world at this important period. The materials that made up this band were the virtuous and laborious ; its master- builders the Enochs, the Noahs, the Abrahams, the Moses, the Joshuas of the age. There was not a signal connected with it which did not point either to man's extremity or to God's opportunity ; not a grip which did not speak of human relations demanding human sympa- thies ; not a word that did not tell of power, permanency, or wisdom as the result of active, thorough devotion;"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"LODGE COMBINATIONS. 89 fot a ceremony which was not full of instruction upon (ie great divisions of human knowledge. LODGE COMBINATIONS. The number of members es- sential to the legal opening and working of a Lodge of Entered Apprentices is seven or more, of whom one at east must be a Master Mason. Where two or three assemble round In work the Lord approves, His spirit with the grasp is found, For 'tis the place he loves: Be now all hearts to friendship given, For we, the Sons of Light, are seven. The number of members essential to the legal open- ing and working of a Lodge of Fellow Crafts is five or more, of whom, at least, two must be Master Masons, the other three being Fellow Crafts. This Lodge of Five from Tyre came, Their leader one of matchless fame; All through the toiling seasons seven, Their time upon this work was given. The number of members essential to the legal opening md working of a Lodge of Master Masons is three or lore, all of that Degree.

THE THREE STEPS. This is an emblem recalling the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"90 THE MASTER MASON. various illustrations of the number Three, and this addi- tional one, that human life has three principal stages - youth, man-hood, and old age. The first is symbolical of the Entered Apprentice, as suggested under the head of \" Theory of the First Degree,\" on a preceding page. Masons of that grade are therefore exhorted indus- triously to occupy their minds in the attainment of use- ful knowledge. The second step is beautifully emblem- atical of the Fellow Craft, who is exhorted in the lectures of his Degree to apply the knowledge which he acquired as an Entered Apprentice to the discharge of his re- spective duties to God, \"his neighbor, and himself. The third step is emblematical of the Master Mason, who, in the enjoyment of those happy reflections consequent upon a well-spent life, prepares his mind for a blissful hereafter. Corresponding with this emblem the being of man has three periods time, death, and eternity. Upon one of these steps every member of our widely-spread Order is now standing. He who writes this and he who reads it stands upon the first; but who can anticipate the period of his stay? Upon the second hundreds are standing, gasping, tottering, perhaps dreading the illimitable pro- found that opens before thorn, while in the unknown ex- istence of the third is the great mass of those who, like ourselves, have \"Met upon the Level, to part upon the Square.\" THE POT OF INCENSE.

A pure heart perpetually ascends in per- fumes of gratitude, like the cloud of celestial white that filled the Temple, and like the heaven-descended flame that burned day and night within the sanctum sanctorum. Such is the offering of prayer, the most acceptable in- cense the human heart can raise. Incense for the service of the Sanctuary was ordered to be made of frankincense and other gums and spices, the materials and manufacture of which are particularly described in the Divine Law. It was the business of the priest to offer it up, morning and evening, upon an altar especially erected for this purpose, and this was called the Altar of Incense. The preparation of it for common use was positively forbidden; neither could any other composition be offered as incense upon this altar, nor could this be offered by any but the priest. The Incense approved by God under the present dispensation is more fragrant, more costly, and more acceptable than the rich- est gums of Arabia. The service and the time of offer- ing is in the option of every man. Whenever a Freema- son looks upon the emblem, he should be reminded to make at least one ejaculation of thanksgiving, praise, or confession to Him who ever heareth. THE BEE-HIVE.- This emblem of industry has pecu- liar meaning to the members of a society based upon a working model. The slothful inactivity of the rational drone is severely reproved by it. The industrious bee rises early to the labors of the summer day, gathering from the variegated carpet of nature an aniple supply of food for the winter of his year.

On the contrary, idleness is. the parent of poverty and immorality. Such are the lessons taught by all the working tools the Gauge and Gavel, the Square, Level and Plumb, and the Trowel of the Craft. Every day of the six properly devoted to labor should be so divided that while a share may be given to works of charity and devotion, and a share to refreshment and sleep, one measured part may be given to the avocations of life, those callings upon which the interests of society depend. The proverbs of the wise king abound in rebukes upon indolence and admonition to industry: \"Go to the ant, thou sluggard: consider her ways and be wise; which provided her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest. How long wilt thou sleep, sluggard? Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep : so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an armed man.\" THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS GUARDED BY THE TYLER'S SWORD. So much has been said in this volume upon the importance of secrecy as a Masonic virtue, that the ap- plication of this emblem will be easy. The Book of Con- stitutions, as an emblem, represents all the instruction, esoteric and exoteric, connected with the Masonic ritual. The Tyler of the Lodge, whose emblem, badge, and im-, plement are the Sword, is the guardian of those assem- blages held for the purpose of lawfully communicating the secrets of Masonry. Thus the Sword guarding the Book recalls to the memory of the initiate all the instruc- tions communicated to him upon this subject. This em- blem will convince the Mason of the policy of preserving"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE SWORD POINTING TO THE NAKED HEART 93 inviolably the important secrets which are committed to his breast. Various passages from the Holy Scriptures are ap- pended to enforce these lessons: \"Be ye afraid of the sword, for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a judgment.\" \"Even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise, and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.\" \"Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from troubles. As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honor to a fool.\" \"Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee.\" It will be observed, however, that with us the Sword is but a symbol. There is no punishment in Masonry for the highest crimes, beyond expulsion from the Order. THE SWORD POINTING TO THE NAKED HEART. This emblem is the complement of the last. The punishments of Masonry, at the greatest, are but exclusion from the Order. But although Mercy delays the descending stroke of Justice, there is a day appointed in which Justice will be amply avenged, unless Mercy shall secure us in the ark of her retreat. The sword of Almighty vengeance is drawn to reward iniquity, and pointed steadily toward the sinful heart. Were it not for this belief in retributive justice, how painful would be our observations of human life! All history is full of in- stances of the tyranny of the strong over the weak. How much sin against God and humanity is done privily, of which there is no disclosure in this life ! Yet there is a righteous God, and He does not look upon these things without abhorrence. His Law declares : \" The"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"U4 THE MASTER MA SOX. ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.\" \"If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong; and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? for he is not a man as I am, that I should consider him. I will say untp God, do not condemn me/' These are the lessons taught by this emblem. As surely as Masonry encourages us to hope for a reward to the righteous in the world to come, so certainly does it inculcate the doctrine that there is a punishment there for the evil-doer. THE ALL-SEEING EYE. This emblem implies that all the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings; that the eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good, and especially upon them that fear him and hope in his mercy. There is an Eye through blackest night A vigil ever keeps; A vision of unerring light O'er lowly vale and giddy height The Eye that never sleeps. Midst poverty and sickness lain The lowly sufferer weeps; What marks the face convulsed with pain ? What marks the softened look again? The Eye that never sleeps. Above the far meridian sun, Below profoundest deeps, Where dewy day his course begun, Where scarlet marks his labor done The Eye that never sleeps."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE ANCHOR AND THE ARK. 95 No limit bounds the Eternal sight, No misty cloud o'ersweeps; The depths of hell confess the light, Eternity itself is bright The Eye that never sleeps. Then rest we calm, though round our head The life-storm fiercely sweeps ; What fear is in the blast? What dread To us has death? an Eye's o'erhead The Eye that never sleeps. THE ANCHOR AND THE ARK. Under the emblem of Hope, on a previous page, we explained the manner- in which this first of the three theological virtues is incul- cated to Freemasons. The Ark, an emblem of that which survived the flood, reminds us of that ark of safety which will waft us securely over this sea of troubles; and when arrived in a celestial harbor, the an- chor of a well-grounded hope will moor us forever to that peaceful shore \" where the wicked cease from troub- ling and the weary are at rest.\" This grace is equally important and pleasing in this world of uncertainty and change. The present moment is sure to possess some ingredient to embitter the chalice of mortal enjoyment, and how effectually are we relieved by the soothing hope that the deficiencies of the present day shall be supplied by to-morrow ! The Anchor, which is connected with this emblem, is an emblem of security. When the visions of hope are real and rational, as when we hope in the promises of God, in a future state of happiness to the good, and the like, her anchor is sure and steadfast in the harbor of a celestial country.

Green, but far greener is the Faith That gives us victory over death ; Fragrant, more fragrant far the Hope That buoys our dying spirits up; Enduring, but the Charity That Masons teach will never die. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM. The history of this problem is much confused ; some writers attributing its discovery to one person, some to another. Even the period of its discovery is doubtful; but so many of the most practical operations of architecture and surveying depend upon it, that it is difficult to believe its discovery bears date later than the erection of the Egyptian pyr- amids. Its adoption into Freemasonry implies that the members of this Order should be lovers of the arts and sciences. THE HOUR-GLASS. LIFE'S sands are dropping, dropping, Each grain a moment dies, No stay has time, no stopping; Behold, how swift he flies !

This emblem is trite : as the mower cuts the grass in its season, Death, the grim leveler, sweeps away the human race at the appointed time. Behold, what havoc the Scythe of Time has made in the genera- tions of man ! If by chance we should escape the nu- merous evils incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor, to the years of manhood, yet, withal, we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring Scythe of Time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have* gone before us. THE EMBLEMS OF MORTALITY. At first view these emblems, the Setting-Maul, the Spade, the Coffin, the Open Grave, and the Sprig of Evergreen at its head, seem but to add shades of gloom to those that have just been moralized upon, the Hour-glass and the Scythe. Alas! who can look within an Open Grave without a sensation of profoundest melancholy? Is it for us, we mournfully ask, to resign our manhood and court tho companionship of the worm? Must our eyes, trained to enjoy the charms of nature and of art, be blinded with 7"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"98\"; ' THE MASTER MASON. these clods, our tongues silenced in this narrow recep- tacle? Yes, such will be our doom. A flowing fiver or a standing lake May their dry banks and naked shores forsake; Their waters may exhale and upward move, Their channel leave, to roll in clouds above: But the returning winter will restore What in the summer they had lost before; But if, man, thy vital streams desert Their purple channels and defraud the heart, With fresh recruits they ne'er can be supplied, Nor feel their leaping life's returning tide. . And such are all the lessons of human life. We walk from grave to grave, as one may walk over a hard-fought battle-field, and find no place for his foot save upon the image of his kind. The emblems before us demand the tear of fraternal sympathy, and we can not refuse to weep. The frosts of death have palsied his mortal ten- ement. \" There is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it may sprout again: but man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?\" As Freemasonry, in its three degrees, is an epitome of human life, so one who passes through its impressive ceremonial remains at the last under deep impressions of thje certainty of death and the loathsomeness of the grave.

The shining virtue of Charity, so honorable to our nature and so frequently enjoined in the Holy Volume upon our altars, will appropriately close this chapter. There are none of the characteristics of the an- cient Craft so much valued as this ; their earliest records and their perpetual practice coincide in this particular. Charity includes a supreme love to God and an ardent aifection for the rational beings of his creation. This humane, generous, heaven-inspired principle is diametri- cally opposed to the prime ingredient of human nature, which looks only to self; not until this letter passion is supplanted by the former, will the soul of man be purified and fitted for the society of heaven. The feelings of the heart, guided by reason, should direct the hand of charity."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"100 THE MASTER MASON.

IN entering upon a new system of Masonry, the chap- itral or capitular, distinct in almost every particular from the ancient or symbolical system, a different style of eluci- dation must be 'adopted. We can not any longer look to emblems or symbols as our guides, because there are few characters of this sort applicable to these Degrees. Such designs as ingenious ritualists of the present day have introduced are inconvenient for reference, and will bo thoroughly explained within these pages, but they can not, in a Masonic sense, be styled symbols or emblems. The distinction between Symbolical Masonry, or the Masonry of the Ancient Craft Degrees, and this, which forms the subject-matter of the present and subsequent pages, is, that the one is fixed and bounded by ancient devices called symbols, mostly of an architectural charac- ter, so definite in their character that it is impossible to innovate greatly upon them without detection ; the ether is controlled only by traditions, more or less apocryphal, which receive new forms, as the fancy of modern ritu- alists may treat them. Thus it follows that while the Ancient Craft Degrees are essentially uniform through-"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"108 THE MARK MASTER. out the world, the Degrees conferred in the Chapters and Councils in the United States are essentially different from those which, under similar names, are worked in foreign countries. But with all this confusion of working, liability to inno- vation, and want of antiquity, there is something so beau- tiful in the drama of the following Degrees, the covenants are so impressive and humane, and the lessons inculcated in the various Lectures so fragrant with the spirit of the Divine Word, that it need not be wondered at if, in the United States at least, where the reverence for antiquity is less than in older countries, they are prized equally with the ancient and world-wide system. Almost every Master Mason in this country is, or intends to become, a Royal Arch Mason, and a Mason of the ^Cryptic Rite. What we have said in general terms of the six follow- ing Degrees, (the Mark Master, the Past Master, the Most Excellent Master, the Royal Arch Mason, the Royal Mas- ter, and the Select Master,) we affirm with peculiar empha- sis of the Degree of MARK MASTER. Its drama is exqui- sitely beautiful, exhibiting the work of the scholar, the Christian, the Biblical student, and the genius, who, had he turned his mind to dramatic writings, might even have emulated a Shakspeare. Its covenants are benevolent in an eminent degree, being admirably designed for the fur- therance of that social and charitable intercourse between brethren which this Degree particularly enjoins. Its les- sons, as the following pages will show, are wisely culled from the great treasury of the Divine Word. In brief, so practical is the MARK MASTER'S DEGREE in its char- acter, as conferred in the United States, that its principal device, THE KEY-STONE, is publicly worn, Fearing the same"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"MARK MASTER'S LODGE AND JEWELS. 109 relation to the so-called \" Higher Degrees \" which the symbol of the SQUARE AND COMPASS bears to the \" Lower Degrees.\" In theory, the Degree of MARK MASTER is appendant to that of Fellow Craft, and, could its traditions be his- torically established, might, with propriety, be conferred upon Fellow Crafts as the complement of that grade. Its original members were merely Fellow Crafts ; its lec- tures describe the manner in which Fellow Crafts were classified, governed, and paid; its covenants have direct application to Fellow Crafts alone. But, by general con- sent, the Degree in this country is confined to Master Masons alone, and a new system of Lodges is framed to accommodate it. The title of the organization in which the Degrees of Mark Master, Past Master, Most Excel- lent Master, and Royal Arch Mason are conferred, is Royal Arch Chapter. In a Chapter, not less than nine members can open or work. The government of Chap- ters is intrusted to Grand Chapters of Capitular or Chap- Ural Masonry, of which there is one in every State in the Union. MARK MASTER'S LODGE AND JEWELS. THE ALTAR. The central design in this, as in all preceding Lodges, is the Altar, surmounted with God's revealed Law, crowned with the Masonic implements the Square and Compass. To an observing eye, this constant recurrence of sacred emblems must be highly suggestive. Can an institution be evil in tendency that seeks the blessing of God through every grade of its advancement ? Can the secrecy of which the enemies of"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"110 THE MARK MASTER.

The use of the Jcey-stone as a sym- bolical device is peculiar to the MARK MASTER. Origin- ally connected with a pleasing tradition, upon which the Degree is principally founded, it has become the distinct- ive emblem of the grade ; and the members are impress- ively instructed to mark well its figurative explanation. Upon its front are engraven, within two concentric cir- cles, certain cryptographic characters, known only to the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"MARK MASTER'S LODGE AND JEWELS.

This is some device selected by himself, having reference to his avocation in life, his heraldic bearings, or such figure as is dictated by his fancy. According to the general rule of Mark Masters' Lodges, every member is required to choose a \"Mark\" within a specified time after entrance upon the grade. Such \"Mark\" must not conflict with one previously chosen by a member of the same Lodge; and, being once recorded in the \"Mark Book,\" can not afterward be changed, save by consent of the Lodge. The use of this \"Mark\" in those dispensations of benevolence which form so striking a feature in this sys- tem of Masonry, is exceedingly significant. Its perver- sion is carefully guarded against : no MARK MASTER may pledge his \"Mark\" the second time until it has been redeemed from its former pledge; and the plea of dis- tress made by a MARK MASTER, when accompanied by his \"Mark,\" can not be refused by a member of this grade without violating the covenant of the Degree.

In the Degree of Fellow Craft, of which this of the MARK MASTER is 'but the comple- ment, the Masonic application of the Square is explained. As applied to the person of a candidate for Masonic light, the Square expresses that he must be physically, men- tally, and morally perfect, to be able to pass the strict ordeal of Ancient Craft Masonry. The three squares used in the Lodge of MARK MASTERS have the same gen- eral reference, but in a more extended and threefold sense. Here the works of each member are considered as applied to the squares of the Divine Law in the three dispensa- tions : the Patriarchal, the Mosaic, and the Christian. The grand trial of humanity to be had at the last day, when God \" Shall try the blocks we offer with his own unerring square,\" is forcibly expressed, and an inimitable moral drawn. There is impressed upon every member the duty of being circumspect in all his words and actions, and of discoun- tenancing immorality in others, as well as of keeping his own white apron untarnished by a single stain.

Palestine, as a territory, is destitute of forests suitable for building material. When, therefore, King David pro- jected a grand edifice which should be the crowning glory of the reign of his son Solomon, and an evidence of the national devotion to God, he made application to Hiram, the Phoenician monarch, whose possessions included the powerful mountain ranges of Lebanon, for a supply of the cedars which grew there in unparalleled abundance. The Tyrian king, between whom and King David there existed a more than royal friendship, readily acceded to his request; and thus the work of preparation for build- ing was expedited. So large was the supply of this mate- rial furnished to King Solomon, that, after the comple- tion of the edifice upon Mount Moriah, which occupied seven years and upward, King Solomon erected, upon the contiguous hill westward, a palace for his own use, in which, so abundantly did the cedar enter, that it was entitled \"the House of Lebanon.\" On Lebanon's majestic brow The grand and lofty cedars grew That, shipped in floats to Joppa's port, . Up to Jerusalem were brought. The principal groves of cedar were found about one hundred and fifty miles north-west of Jerusalem, and not far from the sea-coast on which the cities of Sidon, Sarepta, and Tyre stood.

Here they were adapted, by the tools of the work- men, to the exact places they were to occupy in the Temple, and then carried by land to the Sacred Hill. Being incorruptible to atmospheric influences, the cedar beams and planks thus used might have remained to this day, the ornaments of Moriah and Sion, and the tokens of the brotherly covenants that connected the monarchs of Israel and Phoenicia, but for the destructive influences of invasion. The Temple, having stood four hundred and sixteen years, was burned by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, who was the instrument in God's hand to chas- tise a rebellious and idolatrous people. The number of cedars remaining upon Lebanon is very small less, it is said, than one hundred; but these are grand specimens of the Creator's power, towering in sub- limity in the valleys, where they are hidden, and suggest- ing what must have been the ancient glory of Lebanon, covered with a growth of such. JOPPA. The peculiarly hilly, and even precipitous, character of Joppa is preserved in the traditions of the Degree of MARK MASTER, and a benevolent moral de- duced, in accordance with the entire instructions of the grade. True charity, a plant divinely nursed, Fed by the hope from which it rose at first, Thrives against hope, and in the rudest scene; Storms but enliven its unfading green ; Exuberant is the shadow it supplies; Its fruit on earth, its growth above the skies."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"116 THE MARK MASTER, Thus no opportunity is lost, either in covenants, em- blems, traditions, or dramatic exercises, to impress upon the candidate's mind the Divine lesson that, great as faith and hope are esteemed in their effects upon the human heart, \"the greatest of these is charity.\" THE WHITE STONE. Many references are made in this Degree to \"the white stone,\" \"the head-stone,\" \"the stone which the builders rejected,\" \"the head of the corner.\" The whole of this, however, is most impressively con- veyed in the following passage from Revelations: \"To him that overcome th will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving him that receiveth it.\" THE METHOD OF VIGILANCE. The vast numbers of workmen who labored upon the Temple more than one hundred and fifty thousand will suggest to the mind some of the difficulties encountered in rewarding merit by a fair compensation to the laborers, and punishing the guilty, both those who idly dissipated their time, and those who attempted, through fraud, to secure wages which they had not earned. These difficulties, quite in- superable to an ordinary mind, were thoroughly obviated by the wisdom of Solomon, and it is believed that no instance of impropriety occurred, during the whole labor, which was not summarily detected and punished. From the traditions in which these matters are communicated, speculative Masons derive moral instruction, apt, abound- ing, and important. THE WORKING TOOLS. The implements of practical architecture, adopted as appropriate to this Degree, are the chisel and the mallet. The former suggests the"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE CLOSING INJUNCTIONS. 117 effects of discipline and education upon the human heart, in discovering the latent virtues of the mind, drawing them forth to range the large field of matter and space, and displaying the summit of human knowledge, viz., our duty to God and to man. The latter suggests that, in the school of discipline, a man may learn to be content. What the mallet is to the workman, enlightened reason is to the passions ; it curbs ambition, it depresses envy, it moderates anger, and it encourages good dispositions. THE DIVINE LAW OF JUSTICE. In the ceremony of closing the Lodge of MARK MASTERS is introduced the parable of the householder, who employed laborers, as he found them in waiting in the market-place, to do the work of his vineyard. To each he proffers a specified rate of wages upon which the labor was performed. And when, at the close of day, he called together the workmen, and, paying them the covenanted compensa- tion, he found some dissatisfied with the distribution, not because there had been any breach of the contract, but because the laborers of but an hour were receiving as much as those who had borne the burden and heat of the day, the householder silenced their unreasona-ble complaints by reference to the Divine law of justice. THE CLOSING INJUNCTIONS. To the candidate who has passed thoughtfully through the dramatic ceremonial of the MARK MASTER'S DEGREE, fortunate in having a well- instructed Master and an expert membership, the closing injunctions appeal with great power.

THE THEORY OF THE DEGREE OF PAST MASTER. WHAT we have said of the dramatic beauty of the various degrees elucidated in these pages, does not apply to this of PAST MASTER so much as to the others. Its drama is but slight, but a single lesson being com- municated therein, viz., that of the proper government of Lodges by Masters. What it lacks in dramatic force, however, is supplied in the importance of the subject. Nothing is more vital to the prosperity of Freemasonry than the proper instruction of Lodge-masters. All Masonic history is uniform in the expression of this fact. Mr. Webb, -in his remarks upon the Degree of PAST MASTER, says : \"It should be carefully studied and well understood by every Master of a Lodge. It treats of the govern- ment of our society and the disposition of our rulers, and illustrates their requisite qualifications. It includes the ceremony of opening and closing Lodges in the sev- eral preceding Degrees, and also the forms of installa- tion and consecration in the tjrand Lodge, as well as private Lodges. It comprehends the ceremonies at lay- ing the foundation-stones of public buildings, and also at 121"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"122 THE PAST MASTER. dedications and at funerals, by a variety of particulars explanatory of those ceremonies.\" The form of government adopted in Masonry is pecu- liar to itself. While the members of a Lodge are unre- stricted in their prerogative of electing, annually, their Master, such an one as they prefer, yet, from the mo- ment of his installation, they resign the management of their Masonic affairs unreservedly into his hands. He is the custodian of their landmarks. From his authority there is no appeal, save to the Grand Master. There can be no meeting of the Lodge without his approbation, as the visible emblem of authority ; the Charter or War- rant, without which the Lodge can not legally assemble, is in his possession. The Lodge has no representatives in Grand Lodge save himself and the two Wardens, nor can these be ousted from the privilege of representation by any action of the Lodge. This sketch of the Mas- ter's relation to the brethren will show that his station is widely different from that of the chairman or president of an ordinary association. Such being the ancient powers and prerogatives of the Master, it is important that they should be carefully hedged around and determined beyond cavil ; also that he should be thoroughly instructed in them. That a spirit of dictation and haughtiness is likely to grow out of so large a range of authority, is highly probable ; and some means of communication between the Lodge-master and others who hold, or have heretofore held, similar authority, must be admitted as very desirable. It is for these purposes the Degree of PAST MASTER is de- signed."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"'DISPENSING WAGES. 123 DISPENSING WAGES. One of the prime duties of a Master is that of \" paying the Craft their wages,\" con- veyed in the following verses : They come from many a pleasant home, To do the ancient work they come, With cheerful hearts, and light; They leave the outer world a space, And, gathering here in secret place, They spend the social night They earn the meed of honest toil, .

This is their meed of honest toil, Wages of corn, and wine, and oil. TIIE BURIAL OF THE DEAD. Another of the primary duties of the Lodge-master is that of a decorous burial of the fraternal dead. This is a subject of so much im- portance as to demand the best efforts of those to whom it is intrusted. All the symbolisms of Freemasonry point to the grave and the shining world beyond for their explication. This is the most impressive ceremony of the Order that can be performed in public. It has in it all the elements of dramatic effect the dead body, the sorrowing mourners, the coffin, the spade, the sprig of evergreen, the open grave. The ritualists, Preston and Webb, whose plans are mainly followed in the United States, give a burial service sufficiently impressive. It only remains for the Lodge-master to lay the subject impressively before the eyes and ears of his congrega- tion. It has been well said that \" a Masonic burial, properly performed, is productive of twelve Masonio"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LODGE. 125 initiations,\" so deep is the impression made on the minds of the community.

THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LODGED The discipline of .the Lodge being essentially in the Lodge-master's care, he is strictly charged, in his own installation service, in fifteen ancient regulations, hedging him so closely about that he can not materially err. These are, in brief, that he shall be a good and moral man ; that he will be peace- able and law-abiding ; that he will avoid plots and con- spiracies ; that he will respect the civil magistrate, work diligently, live creditably, and act honorably by all men ; that he will honor the Masonic rulers, and submit to their awards ; that he will avoid private quarrels, and cherish temperance; that he will be cautious, courteous, and faithful ; that he will respect the true brethren and dis- countenance the false ; that he will promote the general good of society, cultivate the social virtues, and propa- gate the knowledge of Masonry ; that he will pay homage to the Grand Master, and conform to the lawful edicts of the Grand Lodge ; that he will suffer no innovations in the body of Masonry; that he will attend the sessions of Grand Lodge ; that he will permit no new Lodge to be formed save by consent of Grand Lodge, and give no countenance to clandestine Masonry; that he will admit no man a Mason without cautious scrutiny into charac- ter; and that he will put visitors to due examination before admission."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"126 THE PAST MASTER. THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON. The PAST MASTER has his own traditions relative to King Solomon and his Temple. The following is the scriptural account of this edifice : \"The house which King Solomon built for the Lord, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house ; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house. And for the house he made windows of narrow lights. And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle : and he made chambers round about.

It was begun in the year of the world 2992, and before the Christian era 1012; and, as the Biblical narrative positively asserts, was completed in about seven years. In its construction, Solomon engaged the cooperation of Hiram, the King of Tyre, and of the most skillful artist of that, and, perhaps, of any age, called, it is said, in the Phoenician dialect, Abdonemus, but, in the ancient Masonic constitutions, Amom, or Hiram Abiff, as his Assistant Grand Master of the work.

The spirit of the Dedi- cation Prayer is the spirit of this grade, wherein King Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, in the pres- ence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven, and blessed the Lord God of Israel in fitting terms as a covenant-keeping God. Then, in a series of seven petitions, he asked : 1. That the Temple might become a holy place, in which perjury should ever be detected arid punished. 2. That Israel, stricken at any time before the enemy for their sins, if they should turn toward the Temple and confess, pray, and make supplication to God, might bo forgiven and brought again to the land of their fa: 3.

These seven grand requests being proffered in the hearing of the assembled millions, King Solomon now solemnly blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying: \"The Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers. \"Let him not leave us nor forsake us. \"Let these words of supplication be nigh unto the Lord day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his serv- aut and of his people Israel, at all times, as the matter shall require : that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is (uul, and that there is none else. \"Let your heart, therefore, be perfect with the Lord our God, to walk in his statutes and to keep his com* mamlments, as at this day/* THE PARTING COUNSEL.

WHATEVER degree of popularity the preceding De- grees of Mark Master and Most Excellent Master may have acquired, on account of their beauty of drama, their humane covenants, and the wisdom with which their lectures are framed, they must surrender the palm in all these respects to the one now before us, that of ROYAL ARCH MASON. .

It is the summit and perfection of ancient Masonry. It impresses on our mind a belief of the being and existence of a Supreme Deity, without beginning of days or end of years, and reminds us of the reverence due to His holy name.\" To understand properly the theory of this elaborate and beautiful Degree, we must recall to mind the his- torical fact, more minutely described further on, that the temple of King Solomon, whose construction forms the 141"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"142 THE EOYAL ARCH MASON. subject-matter of the several Degrees of Entered Ap- prentice, Fellow Craft, Master Mason, Mark Master, and Most Excellent Master, was totally destroyed and leveled to its foundation by the Chaldeans, under Nebu- chadnezzar, four hundred and nine years after its com- pletion and dedication. The Jewish nation was carried into captivity to Babylon, where they remained for fifty- two years. Then a portion of them, led by Zerubbabel, returned to Jerusalem, by permission of the reigning king, and rebuilt the temple. This rebuilding, including the national history from the destruction of the first temple, nineteen years before, constitutes the basis of the ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. It can readily be seen, that in this broad field the ritualist had stirring matter to his hand; the destruction of the temple and city; the la- mentable journey of eight hundred miles into captivity; the mournful exile, which even the singing of \" the songs of Sion\" could not enliven ; the joyful return westward, when the days of captivity were ended; and the devoted, self-sacrificing labors of the reconstruction all thesej with subsidiary themes, which the genius of the ritual- ist could so readily intersperse, make up the grandest display of which the science of Freemasonry, ancient or modern, admits. THE BANNERS OF THE TRIBES. The grand march of the Israelites through the wilder- ness from Egypt to Canaan was conducted with an order and system truly admirable. Each tribe had a banner, with distinctive devices borrowed from the imagery em- ployed in the death-bed prophecy of Jacob, (Gen. xlix.)"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THE BANNERS OF THE TRIBES. 143 As these banners are of practical application in the in- structions of the ROYAL ARCH MASON, we give them here in some detail. 1. REUBEN. Jacob said of Reuben, \"Thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.\" The emblem inscribed on the banner of Reuben was that of a young man in the prime of his strength. The place of Reuben in the desert-encampment was on the south side. Simeon and Gad were his supporters. In the division of Canaan, the tribe of Reuben was stationed in the south-east, directly east of the Dead Sea. 2. SIMEON. Jacob said of Simeon, \" Instruments of cruelty are in his habitation. Cursed be his anger, for it was fierce ; and his wrath, for it was cruel.\" The emblem inscribed on the banner of Simeon was an instru- ment of war. The place of Simeon in the desert-encamp- ment was as a supporter of Reuben, on the south side. In the division of Canaan, the tribe of Simeon was sta- tioned in the south-west, on. the Mediterranean coast. 3. LEVI. Jacob coupled Levi with Simeon in his stern rebuke, quoted above. The emblem inscribed on the banner of. Levi was like that of Simeon, an instru- ment of war. This tribe, being made the sacerdotal tribe, its place in the desert-encampment was in the center, with the tabernacle of the congregation. In the division of Canaan, forty-eight towns and cities, with their suburbs, were allotted to Levi. 4. JUDAH. Jacob said of Judah, \"Thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise ; thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies : thy father's children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp. He couched as"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"144 THE ROYAL AKCH MASON. a lion, and as an old lion.\" The emblem incribed on the banner of Judah was a couching lion under a crown and scepter. The place of Judah in the desert-encamp- ment was on the east side. Issachar and Zebulun were his supporters. In the division of Canaan, the tribe of Judah was stationed in the south. 5. ZEBULUN. Jacob said of Zebulun, \" He shall dwell at the haven of the sea, and he shall be for a haven of ships.\" The emblem inscribed on the banner of Zebu- lun was a 'ship. The place of Zebulun in the desert- encampment was as a supporter of Judah, in the east. In the division of Canaan, the tribe of Zebulun was sta- tioned on the west of the Sea of Galilee. 6. ISSACHAR. Jacob said of Issachar, \" He is a strong ass, couching down between two burdens.\" The emblem inscribed on the banner of Issachar was a strong ass, couching between two burdens. The place of Issachar in the desert-encampment was as a supporter of Judah, in the east. In the division of Canaan, the tribe of Issa- char was stationed south of Zebulun, on the Plain of Esdrelon. 7. DAN. Jacob said of Dan, \"Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.\" The emblem inscribed on the banner of Dan was a ser- pent biting the heels of a mounted horse. The place of Dan in the desert-encampment was on the north side, Asher and Naphtali being his supporters. In the divi- sion of Canaan, the tribe of Dan was stationed north of Simeon, on the Mediterranean coast. 8. GAD. Jacob said of Gad, \" A troop shall overcome"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE BANNERS OF THE TRIBES. 145 him, but he shall overcome at the last.\" The emblem inscribed on the banner of Gad was a troop of horsemen. The place of Gad in the desert-encampment was as a supporter of Reuben, in the south. In the division of Canaan, the tribe of Gad was stationed north of Reuben, east of the Jordan. 9. ASHER. Jacob said of Asher, \" Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.\" The emblem inscribed on the banner of Asher was a prolific tree. The place of Asher in the desert-encamp- ment was as a supporter of Dan, in the north. In the division of Canaan, the tribe of Asher was stationed in the north-west, along the Mediterranean coast. 10. NAPHTALI. Jacob said of Naphtali, \"Naphtali is a hind let loose : he giveth goodly words.\" The emblem inscribed on the banner of Naphtali was a hind let loose. The place of Naphtali in the desert-encampment was as a supporter of Dan, in the north. Jn the division of Canaan, the tribe of Naphtali was stationed in the north. 11. JOSEPH. Jacob said of Joseph, \" Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a wall, whose branches run over the wall. His bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob. The blessings of thy father shall be on the head of Joseph.\" The em- blem inscribed on the banners of the two sons of Joseph, JEphraim and Manasseh, was luxuriant branches overrun- ning a wall. The place of Ephraim in the desert-en- campment was on the west. Manasseh and Benjamin were his supporters. In the division of Canaan, the tribe of Ephraim was stationed north of Benjamin, run- ning from the Jordan to the Mediterranean coast. The 10"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"146 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. tribe of Manasseh had two portions, one occupying tho space between Ephraim and Tssachat; the other north of Gad, and extending along the east of the Sea of Galilee to the base of Mount Herroon. 12. BENJAMIN. Jacob said of Benjamin, \" Benjamin shall raven as a wolf; in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.\" The emblem inscribed on the banner of Benjamin was a ravening wolf. The place of Benjamin in the desert- encampment was as a supporter of Ephraim, in the west. In the division of Canaan, the tribe of Benjamin was stationed north of Judah. In the prophecy of Moses, delivered just before hia death, (Deut. xxxiii,) he reiterates these blessings, elab- orating upon the symbolisms of Jacob, and giving strange* beauty to the definitions of these devices. The groupings of the twelve standards deserve our attention. It will be seen by the sketch we have given, and by an examination of the 10th chapter of Numbers, that the general order of march was as follows : I. Judah. Issachar. Zebulun. II. Keuben. Simeon.

The military signals for this grand army were made upon two silver trumpets. These were made of \"an whole piece\" of metal, and used for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps. A certain signal upon one trumpet was for the princes, \"the heads of the thousands of Israel,\" to assemble themselves together \" at the, door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\" An alarm blast, blown once, was the signal for Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, who were on the east, to move forward. An alarm blast, blown twice, was the signal for Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, who were on the south, to move for- ward. But when the congregation was to be gathered together, they should blow, but should not sound an alarm. The sons of Aaron, the priests, should blow with the trumpets, and they should be to them \" for an ordi- nance forever, throughout their generations.\""},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"148 THE EOYAL ARCH MASON.

In the American system of the ROYAL ARCH, great prominence is given to the veils or curtains of the Tab- ernacle. These are made and set up, as nearly as pos- sible, in imitation of those prepared in the wilderness by direct inspiration from God; also, those afterward con- structed under the directions of Solomon, of which the description is, \"He made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.\" (2 Chron., iii.) The Tabernacle, of which the veils or curtains were used as drapery, was built for God, partly to be the pal- ace of his presence as the King of Israel, and partly as the place of the most solemn acts of public worship. It was constructed with extraordinary magnificence in every part, according to the express instruction of Jehovah, and evidently with typical design and use. The means of building it were furnished in superabundance by the voluntary contributions of the people. The oversight of the work was intrusted to Bezaleel and Aholiab, each of"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE VEILS OF THE TABERNACLE. 149 whom was endowed with supernatural skill for that pur- pose, and who bore the same relation to this structure which the Operative Grand Master Hiram bore to the Temple of Solomon. The plan, size, material, furniture, etc., to the most minute particulars, were revealed to Moses upon Mount Sinai. The whole space inclosed for the Tabernacle was one hundred and fifty feet by sev- enty-five. This space was surrounded by fine linen cur- tains, nearly eight feet in height, and hung from brazen or copper pillars. They were secured by rods or cords, fastened to the top, and stretched so as to fasten to wooden or metal pins in the ground. Twenty of these pillars or columns were on each side, and ten on each end. The entrance or gate of the court was closed with a curtain of different color and texture from the rest, stretched on four of the pillars, and so hung as to be drawn up or let down at pleasure. At the upper part or western end of this inclosure, and facing the entrance, was the Tabernacle, properly so called, of which all that we have thus far described was but the fencing. This Tabernacle proper was forty-five by fifteen feet, and fifteen feet high. The sides and rear were inclosed with boards, the front was open. Over the top was thrown a rich, gorgeous fabric, of various materials, the connection and disposition of which, as well as of the other parts of the covering, were prescribed with the utmost minuteness. The entrance or door of the Tabernacle was covered with a beautifully-embroid- ered curtain, suspended on five columns. The interior was subdivided into two apartments, and separated, each from the other, by a richly-wrought curtain, hanging entirely across, and reaching from the top to the bot-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"150 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. torn. This was called the veil, or second veil, because the first entrance was also curtained. The outer apart- ment was called the Holy Place or Sanctuary, or the first Tabernacle, and the inner was the second Taber- nacle or the Most Holy Place, or the Holiest of all. The Tabernacle and its court were finished with perfect exactness, according to the pattern or model supernatu- rally revealed to Moses. And it is estimated that the silver and gold used in its construction, to say nothing of the brass or copper, the wood, the curtains and can- opies, the furniture, etc., amounted to an almost incred- ible sum. When it was finished, it was consecrated, with very solemn and imposing rites, to the service of Jehovah. As all this was used, with more or less exactness, in the construction of Solomon's Temple, afterward in that by Zerubbabel, of which the Degree of ROYAL ARCH MASON particularly treats, and still later in that by Herod, made forever memorable by the visits of Jesus Christ, a sketch of the use and history of the first Tab- ernacle is appended: While passing through the wilderness, the Tabernacle was always pitched in the midst of the camp. The tents of the Levites and priests surrounded it in appointed order, and at some distance from them the residue of the tribes, in four great divisions, consisting of three tribes each, and each division with its appropriate name and standard, or banner. On the east was Judah, assisted by Issachar and Zebulun; on the south Reuben, assisted by Simeon and Gad; on the west Ephraim, assisted by Manasseh and Benjamin; on the north Dan, assisted by Asher and Naphtali. The symbolical banners, relative"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE HUMAN BODY A TABERNACLE. 151 numbers of the tribes, etc., are minutely given upon another page in this volume. The Tabernacle and its furniture were so constructed as to be conveniently taken down, transported, and set up again; and particular individuals or classes had their respective duties assigned to them. Every encampment, to the number of forty-two, and every removal, and even the order of the march, were directed expressly by Jeho- vah. On the day the Tabernacle was completed, God revealed himself in a cloud which overshadowed and filled it. By this cloud assuming the shape of a pillar or column, their subsequent course was governed. When it rested over the tent, the people always rested; and when it moved, the Tabernacle was taken down, and the entire host of Israel followed wherever it led. In the night this cloud became bright, like a pillar of fire, and preceded them in like manner. When the journeyings of the people ended, and they entered Canaan, the Tabernacle was erected at Gilgal, where it continued until the country was subdued; thenco it was removed to Shiloh, where it stood between three hundred and four hundred years. It was thence removed to Nob, and thence, in the reign of David, to Gibeon, where it stood at the commencement of Solomon's reign.

THE ALTAE, The use of the Altar in the ceremonies of the ROYAL ARCH is even more impressive than in other grades. Under the Jewish law, an altar was a structure appro- priated exclusively to the offering of sacrifices. Though sacrifices were offered before the Flood, the word altar does not occur until the time of Noah's departure from the Ark. Altars were of various forms, and at first very rude in their construction, being nothing more, probably, than a square heap of stones or a mound of earth. The altar upon which Jacob made an offering at Bethel was the single stone which had served him for a pillow during the night. The altar which Moses was commanded to build was to be made of earth ; or, if made of stone, it was expressly required to be rough, the use of a tool being regarded as polluting. It was also to be without steps. In the ancient patterns of altars, although the struc-* tures are different, yet we observe upon the most of them a projection upward at each corner, representing the true"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"154 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. figure of the. horns, used, probably, to confine the victims. This should be imitated upon the Masonic Altar. The altars required in the Jewish worship, from which so much of the allegory of the ROYAL ARCH is borrowed, were the Altar of Burnt-offering, or the Brazen Altar. and the Altar of Incense, or the Golden Altar. The first stood directly in front of the principal entrance of the Tabernacle in the wilderness. It was made of shittim- wood, which is doubtless the Masonic Acacia, one of the llnest emblems upon the Trestle-board of Freemasonry. It was seven feet six inches square, and four feet six inches high. It was hollow, and covered or overlaid with plates of brass. The horns upon each corner were of wood, overlaid in the same way. A grate or net-work of brass was also attached to it, either to hold the fire or to support a hearth of earth. The furniture of the altar was all of brass, and consisted of a shovel, a pan, skins or vessels for receiving the blood of the victims, and hooks for turning the sacrifice. At each corner of the altar was a brass ring, and there were also two staves or rods, overlaid with brass, which passed through these rings, and served for carrying the altar from place to place. The fire used upon this altar was divinely sent and perpetually maintained. The altar was a place of con- stant sacrifice; fresh blood was shed upon it continually, and the smoke of the burning sacrifice ascended up with- out interruption toward heaven. In the first Temple the Altar of Burnt- offering occupied the same relative posi- tion as in the Tabernacle : it was thirty feet square, and fifteen feet high. In the Temple of Zerubbabel it was still larger and more beautiful than in the first."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE BURNING BUSH. 155 The Altar of Incense stood within the Holy Place, near the inmost veil. It was eighteen inches square, and twice as high, constructed like the other. The top, sides, and horns were overlaid with pure gold, and it was finished around the upper surface with a crown or border. The rings and rods were like the other, gold being used instead of brass. Incense was burned every morning and even- ing upon it, but no other offerings. Only once a year, when the Priest made atonement, was it stained with blood. THE BURNING BUSH. There are few incidents in the early Scriptures more remarkable or significant than that in which the emblem of the Burning Bush figures. It is described in the third chapter of Exodus : \"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in- law, the priest of Midian : and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. \"And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. \"And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. \"And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. \"And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"156 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thoti standest is holy ground. \"Moreover he said, I am the GoS of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face : for he was afraid to look upon God.\" This remarkable display of Omnipotent power was the preamble to a most important declaration to Moses ; viz., that God had looked with a pitying eye upon the sorrows of his people, bondsmen in Egypt ; that the time of their deliverance was now nigh at hand, and that he, Moses, was the chosen instrument in the hand of God to bring them forth from slavery. Perhaps the ineffable brightness of the Godhead was never so clearly poured upon mortal vision as in that memorable transaction which this symbol is designed to signify. We know that \" no man can see God face to face and live;\" therefore the prophet hid his face, unable to sustain the bright effulgence of uncreated glory. It is but a natural deduction, from this circumstance, to teach that, in order to gain admission into the heavenly mount, burning with far greater brilliancy than that which dazzled the wanderer on the back side of the desert, we must be purified by fire. As this was the beginning of the career of Moses as the Lawgiver and Leader of the hosts of Israel, it will be proper to add that the history of his official life for the forty years following is the history of the Jewish nation from the close of their bondage in Egypt to their approach to the land of promise.

There is one use to be made of the Burning Bush as an emblem, too direct and striking to be overlooked. As this Bush, although on fire, was not consumed, so the Church of God, and, in the same allegory, the Masonic institution, though, from age to age, burning under the fires of persecution, have never been consumed. Nor can they be. God is in them \" the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob\" and they can not be consumed.. In the Masons' Lodge His Word lies open, the center of attraction, the object to which all entering must approach. In the east of the Lodge, His initial shines forth, catching the eye of one entering when he raises it from the open Word. His name is ever invoked in prayers, covenants, lectures, instruc- tions. This, Bush, though burning, can never be con- sumed while God is in it.

Without this theory, much of the emblems and other in- structions are without meaning. The following lines, written for the consecration service of a Masonic body, are appropriate here : Lo, God is here ! our prayers prevail ; In deeper reverence adore; Ask freely now, he will not fail His largest, richest gifts to pour.

Good for us, for our honor and comfort; pleasant and pleasing to God and good men. A rare thing, and therefore commendable. An amiable thing, that will attract our hearts. An exemplary thing, which, where it is, is to be imitated by us with holy emulation. \" The pleasantness of it is illustrated in verse 2. It is fragrant as the holy anointing oil which was strongly perfumed, and diffused its odors, to the great delight of all the bystanders, when it was poured upon the head of Aaron or his successor, the high-priest, so plentifully that it ran down the face, even to the tfollar or binding of the garment. This was holy ointment ; such must our brotherly love be with a pure heart devoted to God. We must love them that are begotten ' for His sake that begat. 3 This ointment was a composition made up by a Divine dispensatory. God appointed the ingre- dients and the quantities. Thus believers are ' taught, of God to love one another.' It is a grace of His work- ing in us. \" It was very precious, and the like of it was not to be made for any common use.

It is 'as the dew;' it brings abundance of blessings along with it, as numerous as the drops of dew. It cools the scorching heat of men's passions as the evening dews cool the air and re- fresh the earth. It contributes very much to our fruit- fulness in every thing that is good. It moistens the heart, and makes it tender and fit to receive the good seed of the Word ; as, on the contrary, malice and bit- terness unfit us to receive it. It is ' as the dew of Her- nion,' a common hill; for brotherly love is the beauty and benefit of civil societies ; < and as the dew tbat de- scencled upon the mountains of Zion/ a holy liili, for it contributes greatly to the fruitfulness of sacred societies.

Nor should our love for our brethren stay for theirs to us that is publican's l ove but go before it ; that is Divine Z0t j. \" The proof of the excellency of brotherly love is given in the fourth verse.

All the localities described in the Masonic lectures are connected with Palestine or the countries Egypt and Chaldea contiguous thereto. This makes it neces- sary, in a course of instruction like this, to give a sketch of what is familiarly termed \" the Holy Land.\" The extreme length of the country, measured from Dan to Beersheba, is about one hundred and eighty miles. Its average breadth is fifty, from the Mediterranean Sea to the deserts on the east. The area of the country is not far from twelve thousand miles, which is about the size of Vermont, to which State .it also approximates in shape and ruggedness. There is no district on the face of the earth that con- tains so many and such sudden transitions as Palestine. It is at once a land of mountains, plains, and valleys. 11"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"162 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. In the north, the Lebanon Mountains divide into two parallel ranges. The western range has summits of thirteen thousand feet. It is broken by the River Leontes, opposite Tyre ; decreases in height but ex- pands in breadth to Nazareth, where it is again broken by the Plain of Esdrselon. Rising again into the hills of Samaria, this range continues thirty-three miles, and is, for *the third time, broken by the Plain of Shechem, near Mount Gerizim. Rising again into the hills of Ephraim, of Benjamin, and of Judah, it finally termin- ates in the deserts to the south. The eastern range includes Mount Hermon, ten thou- sand feet high ; sweeps from thence round the Sea of Galilee eastward into the mountains of Bashan, Gilead, Ammon, Moab, and Edom, and terminates in the hills of Arabia Petrea, at the head of the Bay of Akabah. These two parallel ranges, covering, as they do, four- fifths of the whole country, form the most prominent features in Palestine. The valley that separates them, called Coelesyria, is three hundred and fifty miles in length, and from seven to ten miles broad, serving as the bed of the Orontes, the Litany, and the Jordan. The greater portion of the towns and cities of Pales- tine were situated in the hilly country. This was for protection, in a country always subject to invasion. Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, Bethel, Sliiloh, and Sa- maria are instances of this. Although at present Palestine is but thinly inhabited, its soil poorly cultivated, and the state of society uncivil- ized in the extreme, yet* in the days when the name and the law of God were respected, this was one of the most populous, civilized, and fruitful nations upon earth."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE LAND OF PALESTINE. 163 There is almost an air of extravagance in the inspired description of Palestine. Its marvelous richness ; its cattle upon a thousand hills ; its metallic wealth ; its abounding pastures ; its people, numerous, strong, and respected throughout the earth, all these combined to make it the chosen nation of the world. The hills were terraced to their very tops for purposes of cultivation. The numerous springs and fountains were used to irri- gate, to the last drop, the soil around. The rains* of heaven were collected in great pools and cisterns, of which the remains every-where attract the eye to the present day. And, under the guidance of the wisest sages, the arts of agriculture, commerce, and architect- ure made Palestine a coveted land, ages before Greece and Rome sprung from obscurity. Such was the beautiful territory from which the peo- ple, consequent upon their conquest by Nebuchadnezzar, were banished, to become exiles in an unfriendly land.* The story of their calamity is a sad one. Divided into two nations, under Rehoboam, B. C. 971, the national power and reputation of Israel were henceforth dimin- ished by internecine wars. Shishak, King of Egypt, in- vaded the country only foul' years after the death of Solo- mon, captured Jerusalem, and plundered the Temple. One hundred and forty-five years afterward, the northern tribes invaded the southern, captured Jerusalem, and inflicted great destruction upon it. From these misfor- tunes, however, Judah had recovered, when, in the year B. C. 588, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, assisted by all the surrounding nations, who were his tributaries, brought overwhelming numbers against Judah, and it succumbed.

C. 539, the Babylonish monarchy was overthrown by Cyrus, the young prince of Persia, commander of the combined forces of the Medes and Persians. His uncle, Darius, took the kingdom and thus founded the Medo-Persian Empire, as foretold by the Prophet Daniel. The Babylonian Empire had existed eighty-four years, having been founded B. C. 623. Darius lived but two years after the establishment of his power in Babylon, dying in the sixty-ninth year of the captivity. He was succeeded by Cyrus. This man had been distinctly men- tioned by name in the prophecy of Isaiah, made and recorded more than a hundred years before he was born. It had been predicted of him that he should both over- throw the Babylonish monarchy and restore the Jews to their native land and their former privileges. In the first year of the reign of Cyrus and the seven-"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE RETURN HOME. 169 tieth of the captivity, he issued a proclamation through- out his empire, granting a release to all the Jewish cap- tives, with full privileges to return to Palestine, rebuild Jerusalem, and resuscitate the nation. At the same time he restored all the sacred vessels of the Temple, which had been carried away by Nebuchadnezzar, and made other provisions for the immediate accomplishment of the objects of the royal edict.

It is a Rabbinical tradition, that on the return journey the people made fifteen prominent stages, each being term- inated by a halt of sufficient duration for rest and re- freshment : and that the short Psalms, from 120 to 134, inclusive, were sung respectively upon those occasions. The First Stage opens with the expression, \" In my distress I cried unto the Lord;\" the Second Stage, by this, \" I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from w r hence cometh my help ;\" the Third Stage, \" I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of the Lord;\" the Fourth Stage, \"Unto Thee lift I up mine eyes, Thou that dwellest in the heavens ;\" the Fifth Stage, \"If it had not been for the Lord, who was on our side ;\" the Sixth Stage, \" They that trust in the Lord, shall be as Mount Zion, which can not be removed, but abideth forever ;\" the Seventh Stage, \" When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream ;\" the Eighth Stage, \" Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it ;\" the Ninth Stage, \"Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways ;\" the Tenth Stage, \" Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say ;\" the Eleventh Stage, \" Out of the"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"170 THE EOYAL AKCH MASON. deptns have I cried unto Thee, Lord;\" the Twelfth Stage, \" Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty ;\" the Thirteenth Stage, \"Lord, remember David and all his afflictions ;\" the Fourteenth Stage, \" Behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell to- gether in unity ;\" the Fifteenth and last Stage, \" Be- hold, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, which by night stand in the house of the Lord.\" Before following the Jews from the place of their long exile in Chaldea, it is proper here to quote the whole of the 137th Psalm, as giving evidence of their commend- able constancy amidst the most untoward circumstances : \"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down; yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion. \" We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. \" For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. \"How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? \"If I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand for- get her cunning. \"If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. \"Remember, Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. \"0 daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed;"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE RETURN HOME. 171 happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. \" Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.\" THE NATIONAL BEREAVEMENT. The excessive sorrow that afflicted the minds of the Jews at the loss of their country can not be thoroughly appreciated, unless we take into consideration the facts that these people had possessed Palestine for twelve hundred years, counting from the entrance of Abraham;, that their religious pol- ity was thoroughly identified with it, and that their hopes of the Messiah, who should restore to the world all that had been lost in the expulsion from Eden, were locally connected with Bethlehem-Judah, and other designated spots. The lamentations of which the Prophet Jeremiah was the mouthpiece are not an extravagant expression of the national sorrow. Although uttered only as pre- dictions, they foreshadowed the grievous facts that should follow. In this terrible exhibit of human distress we find such passages as these: \" How doth the city sit solitary that was full of peo- ple ! how is she become as a widow ! She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are in her cheeks. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they are be- come her enemies. She dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest.

All that pass by, clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The Perfection of beauty, The Joy of the whole earth? The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.

They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger. \" Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.

It was in these words : \"Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all hia people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jeru- salem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourn- eth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the free-will offering for the house of God which is in Jeru- salem.\" Ezra, i. An expedition of the returning exiles was formed by Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal house of David, and by Joshua, the high-priest. Zerubbabel was in- vested by the king with all the functions of the Gov- ernor of Judea. This colony amounted to about fifty thousand persons. These took with them the vessels of the house of the Lord, being \" thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second sort, four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. All the vessels of gold and silver were five thousand and four hundred.\" (Ezra, i.)

The money contributed by the more liberal of the Jews is summed up at sixty-one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver. So, joyfully they set forth upon the return journey by the same route which their sorrowing and suffering fathers had traveled fifty-one years before. Arrived at Palestine, their first care, after looking up their former homes, and making necessary provisions for their future support, was to rebuild the Temple. In the second year of their coming, Zerubbabel and Joshua, who had taken the supervision, set forward the workmen in the house of God. \"And when the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord, they set the priests in their ap- parel, (described upon another page,) with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cynbals, to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David king of Israel. And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord ; because he is good, for his mercy endureth forever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when ther praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. But many of the priests and Levites, and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"THE RETURN HOME. 175 house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people : for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.\" Ezra, iii. With all this favorable beginning, however, it was nine- teen years before the cape-stone was set in the edifice. The Samaritans, between whom and the Jews there had long existed an implacable hatred, weakened their hands, troubled them in building, and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose, through the reign of Cyrus and his successors to that of Darius. Ahasuerus was moved by their malicious representations to cause the building to cease, nor was it until the second year of the reign of Darius that it was resumed. That mon- arch decreed that no more hindrance should be made to the work, but that money should be given from the royal treasury toward the cost, and young bullocks, rams, and lambs for the burnt-offerings: also wheat, salt, wine, and oil. The royal edict was thus summed up : Whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem.

Upon the last page is described the earnestness with which the Jews acted upon the proclamation of Cyrus, A similar zeal was aroused by the edict of Darius. To encourage them in their work, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah were raised up. They approached them in the name of the God of Israel. The former severely re- buked the disposition of the people to lie supine under the frowns of King Ahasuerus, and commanded them, \" Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house,\" promising them the Divine aid. \" I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former.\" Zechariah brought good word, and comfortable word from God, saying : \" I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies ; mine house shall be built in it ; my cities, through prosperity, shall yet be spread abroad, and the Lord shall yet com- fort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. \" The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this house ; his hands shall also finish it. \"They that are far off shall come, and build in the temple of the Lord : and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you.

Ezra came with full powers from the king to reestablish the authority of the law of Moses. This second colony numbered about seven thousand. The journey occupied exactly four months, by which we can estimate the difficulties and impediments of the way, even under favorable circumstances. The king, Artaxerxes Longimanus, issued an edict, exceedingly liberal in its character, and ending in these impressive words : \"And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.\" Ezra, vii. Thirteen years later, B. C. 444, the third installment of the nation came up, under Nehemiah. He had re- ceived intelligence at Babylon of the decline of the Jew- ish colony, and obtained a commission from the same monarch, Artaxerxes Longimanus, who had favored Ezra, to visit Jerusalem and rectify the disordered state of affairs. The walls of the city had not been rebuilt, and although the temple was finished, and probably walled in, yet the undefended condition of the people at large subjected them to great reproach and persecution from surrounding nations, the Samaritans taking the lead. Nehemiah was appointed governor for twelve years, with full powers to rebuild the city and restore the ancient fortifications. His arrival was one hundred and twelve years subsequent to that of Zerubbabel. At .the expiration of the term of his first commission, he 12"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"178 THE ROYAL AKCH MASON. was reappointed, and continued to serve in that capacity until about the year B. C. 420. During the latter years of his government lived Malachi, the last of the Old Testament prophets. Besides these three principal col- onies that returned from Babylon to repeople the land, whose loss they had so grievously deplored, we may justly suppose that many thousands of Jews took the opportunity to return to their fatherland by caravans of merchants coming from the east, or in other smaller companies of returning Jews. The Jewish nation continued subject to the Persian power until its overthrow by Alexander, the Macedonian, B. C. 331. In all, they had maintained their allegiance to Persia two hundred and eight years. In the division of Alexander's empire, Palestine fell to Ptolemy Lagus. They were subject to the Greek-Egyptian and the Greek- Syrian monarchs one hundred and fifty-eight years, and until the year B. C. 143. Then they regained their independence by virtue of a royal grant from Demetrius Nicator, king of the Greek-Syrian empire, and held it eighty years; viz., till the year B. C. 63, when Judea was made a Roman province by Pompey. They were still, however, permitted to have governors of their -own nation until the time of Christ. In the year A. D. 9, a Roman governor was appointed, tribute was paid directly to Rome, the power of life and death was taken away, and justice administered in the name and by the laws of Rome. Jerusalem ceased to be the capital of Palestine. In the year A. D. 70, the city of Jerusalem was once more totally razed to the ground by Titus, the Roman general, after a siege and series of assaults, in which more than a million of Jews perished. From this stroke"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"RETURNED HOME. 179 the nation has never recovered. Scattered throughout the earth, exiles, down-trodden, suffered to live in small numbers at Jerusalem, but to enjoy no naturalization or political rights, the Jewish people remain standing monu- ments of the truth of Scripture. The importance of the study of these holy books to the ROYAL ARCH MASON can not be exaggerated. 0, early search the Scriptures!

Hither the tribes came up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. Here enraptured prophets saw bright visions of the world above, and received messages from on high for guilty men. Here our Lord and Savior came in the form of a servant, and groaned and wept, and poured out his soul even unto death, to re- deem us from sin, and to save us from the pains of hell. Here, too, the wrath of an incensed God has fallen upon his chosen people, and has laid waste his heritage. No place upon earth has such a history.

PASSING THE YEILS. One of the most forcible and instructive lessons m the whole Masonic system is that inculcated in the drama of the ROYAL ARCH DEGREE, under the general term of \"Returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.\" Under the guise of a difficult and painful pilgrimage, in which the travelers are buoyed up by the sense of duty and the hope of reward, the whole lesson of human life is con- veyed, surrounded with trials and perplexities, but pre- senting the highest injunctions of duty as a stimulus, and offering the most exalted rewards at the end. It is this which, more than any other, makes the lessons of the ROYAL ARCH MASON sublime. The first of the difficulties of the return journey were the trials of the road itself. Upon other pages we have given, in our description of the journey to Babylon, sketches of the road rendered painful by sharp hills, arid deserts, and interminable distances. This is equally ap- plicable here. Although the traveler had not the fitter accompaniments of chains, cruel guards, and hunger, yet no one can pass over the long way of eight hundred miles from Babylon to Jerusalem, even under favorable circumstances, without intense suffering. The introduc- tion of the following Psalms at this stage of the drama is highly appropriate: \"Lord, I cry unto thee : make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee. Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense ; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. \"Set a watch, Lord, before my mouth; keep the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"PASSING THE VEILS. 183 door of my lips. Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity : and let me not eat of their dainties. \"Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities. When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. \"Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth. But mine eyes are unto thee, God the Lord: in thee is my trust ; leave not my soul destitute. \" Keep ni from the snare which they have laid foi me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.\" Psalm cxli. \"I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication. I poured out my complaint before him ; I shewed before him my trouble. \"When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. \"I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me : refuge failed me ; no man cared for my soul.

Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name : the righteous shall compass me about ; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.\" Psalm cxlii. \"Hear my prayer, Lord; give ear to my supplica- tions; in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy right- eousness. And enter not into judgment with thy serv- ant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. \"For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me ; my heart within me is desolate. \"I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.

So many of the Jews had intermarried with their conquerors that great numbers of the people had lost the distinctive characteristic of the nation a pure genealogy and were necessarily rejected when they should offer themselves for a work that admitted none but the pure and undefiled. Before leaving Baby- lon, careful examinations had been made of the genea- logical claims of every family, and those whose record was unquestioned were furnished with tests, by means of which they should have recognition of the High-Priest at Jerusalem. Of these the Royal Arch traditions are full. What the nature of those tests was can not, of course, be explained here. Arrived at Jerusalem, where a tabernacle had been temporarily pitched among the Temple-ruins upon the Holy Hill, every person offering himself for the work was subjected to necessary examinations preparatory to his enrollment among the faithful. Recurrence is now had to the history of Moses in his work of convincing the Egyptians and the Hebrews of his Divinely-appointed mission. Jehovah condescended to bestow upon him evidences of his power ; Moses' rod was transformed to a serpent. When we enter into the world and discover around us the effects of the artifice of the tempter in the garden, and when we behold this arch-apostate transformed into a serpent, we have passed the first veil of our existence. The serpent referred to above was perpetuated as a Jewish symbol by Moses, who, in a terrible irruption of those venomous creatures into his camp, made a Brazen Serpent and set it upon"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"386 THE HOYAL ARCH MASON. a pole, that it might be seen from all parts of the camp, and then whoever was bitten was healed by simply look- ing at the brazen figure. A second miracle was employed by Jehovah to strengthen the faith of Moses. He was directed to put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out it was leprous as snow. On being commanded to put it the second time into his bosom and withdraw it, it was turned again as his other flesh. At the close of life, when we are called from this probationary scene and prostrated in the pallid leprosy of death, the second veil is drawn behind us. The leprosy is a loathsome and infectious disease, still prevalent in Oriental countries, corresponding in its general characteristics with the lep- rosy of former ages. The bones and the marrow are so pervaded with the virus of the disease that the joints of the hands and feet lose their power, the limbs of the body fall together, and the whole system assumes a most deformed and shocking appearance. There is at this day a small village of lepers, numbering in all about two hundred, on the outside of the southern wall of Jerusa- lem, near the Sion Gate. Their homes are miserable huts, low, dark, and loathsome. Allowed to marry only with each other, their offspring retain their health until arrived at the period of puberty, when the fatal disease makes its appearance, spreads over the system, ulti- mately reaches some vital organ, and the unhappy victim dies. Among the miracles by which Moses convinced Pha- raoh of the Divine appointment of his mission, that of taking water from the river Nile, and turning it into blood by pouring it upon the dry land, was one of the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"PASSING THE VEILS. 187 most stupendous. In the morning of the Resurrection, when the slumbering ashes shall revive, and we learn that the words of the woman of Tekoa are ^untrue, wherein she said \" we are as water spilt upon the ground, which can not be gathered up,\" then shall the third veil be parted from us. The effect of this miracle was tre- mendous ; the great river of Egypt was turned to blood. The leader and governor of the first grand colony from Babylon was Prince Zerubbabel. In his name all the proceedings were had; the care of the sacred vessels intrusted to the Jews by King Cyrus, the money, pro- visions, etc., rested upon him. It follows that none could be accepted at Jerusalem save those who had come up under his patronage. The righteous in the last day will have the stamp of the signet of Heaven upon their fore- heads, and be received by the Captain of their salvation. The prophet Haggai gives clear evidence of the Divine acceptance in which Zerubbabel was held when he says, 44 In that day will I take thee, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will take thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee.\" A signet was usually a ring, with some inscription upon it, used as a seal, by the delivery or transfer of which the highest offices in the kingdom were bestowed. The word is used figuratively in the Bible to denote an act, or token, or process of confirmation. We have already alluded to the circumstance which had impaired the legitimacy of so many of the Jewish people. When Esther was made Queen by the King of Persia, though exalted to great honor, yet her line was thus rendered illegitimate according to the Jewish theory; her children could not inherit with their fathers. The"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"188 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. lineage of every family, or list of ancestors, was pre- served by the Jews with extraordinary care not only because it was through Abraham that the privileges of the Jewish Church were transmitted, but chiefly because of the deep interest which was felt in the predictions concerning the Messiah, and the tribe or family fr~m which he should spring. When, therefore, any presented themselves at the tabernacle among the ruins who could not distinctly trace up their descent, they were scornfully rejected. We have evidences of this in the contempt with which the services of the Samaritans were refused by Zerubbabel, who said : \" Ye have nothing to do with us to build our house unto our God;\" and in the case of a number of the children of priests \" who sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore were they, as pol- luted, put from the priesthood.\" Ezra, ii. These sharp tests to which God's people were put, secured workmen of fidelity and zeal. No part of the labor, however arduous, servile, or protracted, was dis- tasteful to them, and they entered upon the work with a determination that could have but one result perfect success. THE HIGH-PRIEST, KING, AND SCRIBE. THE HIGH-PRIEST. The three principal officers of the ROYAL ARCH CHAPTER, as the system is practiced in the United States, are known as the High-Priest, King, and Scribe. Upon the return of the captives from Babylon, Jeshua was High-Priest, a man full of fervency"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"THE KING. 189 and zeal, who took a leading part at Jerusalem in re- building the altar of the Lord, and offering burnt-offer- ings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God. It is further recorded of this devoted servant of the Most High, that \" In the second year of their coming into the house of God at Jerusalem, in the sec- ond month, began . . . Jeshua the son of Jozadak, . . , and appointed the Levites from twenty years old and up- ward to set forward the work of the house of the Lord.\" \" Then stood Jeshua with his sons ... to set forward the workmen in the house of God.\" Ezra, iii. A further instance of the enlightened zeal of Jeshua is seen in his refusing the application of the Samaritans and others who proffered to build the Temple with them. The High-Priest, knowing their illegitimacy, sternly re- plied : \" Ye -have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel, as Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.\" Ezra, iv. THE KING. The King in a ROYAL ARCH CHAPTER represents Zerubbabel, one of the most distinguished characters described in Scripture. So prominent a part did he take during the period under consideration, in leading the first colony of Jews that returned from the captivity of Babylon, in preserving the sacred vessels intrusted by Cyrus to his charge, in laying the founda- tion-stone and cape-stone of the Temple, and in restoring the ancient religious rites of the nation, that the second Temple is familiarly styled Zerubbabel'a, as the first is called Solomon's Temple. In the prophesy of Zechariah"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"190 THE ROYAL AKCH he is made the special subject of a Divine message. \" This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might or power, but by my spirit.

Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. For who hath despised the day of small things ? for they shall re- joice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerub- babel.\" Zechariah, iv. An affecting evidence of the Divine approval of this man is found in various passages in Haggai, a prophet sent with cheering tidings to Jeshua and Zerubbabel at a time when the people had begun to show signs of dis- couragement. Concerning the latter, Haggai said: \"I will take thee, Zerubbabel, my servant, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts.\" THE SCRIBE. The Scribe in a ROYAL ARCH CHAPTER, according to the American system, represents the prophet Haggai, to whom allusions have been made above. This celebrated personage is supposed to have been born during the captivity, and to have returned with Zerub- babel from Babylon. His prophesy ranks as the thirty- seventh in the order of the books of the Old Testament. It is principally composed of keen reproof and affecting exhortations respecting the building of the second tem- ple, which the people had abandoned for fourteen or"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"THE SCRIBE, 191 fifteen years, because of the opposition and intrigue of their enemies ; and it also contains predictions of Christ and the universal establishment of his kingdom. It is supposed that the glory of the temple, which is predicted by Haggai with great clearness, was to be oc- casioned by the coming of Christ; though Herod made important alterations in it, still the temple of Zerubbabel was always regarded as the second temple, and Christ, the Desire of all nations, did appear and teach in it. The Book of Haggai well deserves to be read it is very brief at every meeting of a ROYAL ARCH CHAPTER. As a specimen of the symbolical style and nervous lan- guage with which the man of God urged forward his companions to their duty. of rebuilding the temple and city, see the following : \"In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying, If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy ? And the priests answered and said, No. Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean ? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean. Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean. And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord: since those days were,"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"192 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the press-fat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.

Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.\" Haggai, ii. OFFICIAL DUTIES. The official duties of these three prominent officers of the ROYAL ARCH CHAPTER respect- ively are made as nearly as possible in analogy with those of the Jewish dispensation. The High-Priest is solemnly inducted with the following prayer : \"Most Holy and glorious Lord God, the Great High- Priest of heaven and earth, we approach thee with rever- ence, and implore thy blessings on the Companion ap- pointed to preside over this assembly, and now prostrate before thee. Fill his heart with fear, that his tongue and actions may pronounce thy glory. Make him steadfast in thy service. Grant him firmness of mind; animate his heart and strengthen his endeavors. May he teach thy judgments and thy laws; and may the incense he shall put before thee, upon thine altar, prove an acceptable sacrifice unto thee. Bless him, Lord, and bless the work of his hands.

Glory be to God the Father, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.\" The High-Priest is then invested with the miter, breast-plate, and robe : the former reminding him of the dignity of his office and its inscription, \"Holiness to the Lord\" of his dependence upon God; the breast-plate teaching him his responsibility to the laws of Royal Arch Masonry, and that its honor should ever be near his heart; the robes teaching him, by their symbolical colors, every grace and virtue that can beautify the hu- man mind, The King is taught by his scarlet robe, an emblem of imperial dignity, that paternal concern which he should feel for the welfare of his Chapter, and the ar- dent zeal with which he should endeavor to promote its prosperity; and by his crown, that to reign sovereign in the hearts and affections of men is made grateful to a generous mind, than to rule over their lives and fortunes, and that to do this with honor and satisfaction he must subject his own passions and prejudices to the dominion of reason and charity. The Scribe is taught by his purple robe, an emblem of union, that the harmony and unanimity of the Chap- tei must be his care, and that he must endeavor to es- tablish a permanent union among all degrees and orders in Masonry. In the conclusion of the respective charges, a general address is delivered to the officers, as follows: \"Precept and example should ever advance with equal 13"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"194 THE ROYAL ARCH SIASON. pace. Those moral duties which you are required to teach unto others you should never neglect to practice your- selves. Do you desire that the demeanor of your equals and inferiors toward you should be marked with defer- ence and respect? Be sure, then, that you omit no op- portunity of furnishing them with examples in your own conduct toward your superiors. Do you desire to obtain instruction from those who are more wise or better in- formed than yourselves? Be sure, then, that you are always ready to impart of your knowledge to those within your sphere who stand in need of and are en- titled to receive it. Do you desire distinction among your Companions ? Be sure, then, that your claims to preferment are founded upon superior attainments. Let no ambitious passion be suffered to induce you to envy or supplant a companion who may be considered as better qualified for promotion than yourselves; but rather let a laudable emulation induce you to strive to excel each other in improvement and discipline, ever remem- bering that he who faithfully performs his duty, even in a subordinate or private station, is as justly entitled to esteem and respect as he who is invested with supreme authority.\" In further allusion to these characters, the Scriptural accounts of the office of High-Priest established him as the head of the Jewish priesthood. All the mole de- scendants of Aaron were by divine appointment conse- crated to the priesthood; and the first-born of the family, in regular succession, was consecrated in the same man- ner to the office of High-Priest. The office was origi- nally held for life, but this, as well as the right of the"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE SPIRIT OF THE WORK. 195 firstborn, were disregarded in the latter ages of the Jewish nation. The High-Priest's most solemn, peculiar, and exclusive duty was to officiate in the Most Holy Place on the great day of atonement. He might at any time perform the duties assigned to the ordinary priests, but this one could be performed by himself alone. The High-Priest is supposed to have had an assistant to oc- cupy his place in case of his incompetency from sick- ness, defilement, or otherwise. The title King is that of a ruler. It is often applied in Scripture to the chief of a tribe, or the ruler of a single town or city. The title is preeminently applied to Jehovah and to our blessed Savior. The term Scribe is first given to the king's secretary or messenger, and to such as excelled in the use of the pen; but, in time, it came to mean simply a learned man. It was the peculiar office of the priests and Levites not only to study the book of the law with great diligence, and to read and explain it to the congregation, but to transcribe it and to multiply copies among the nation at large. The scribes and the doctors of the law are terms often applied to the same class of people. THE SPIRIT OF THE WORK. The spirit of freedom, fervency, and zeal with which the labors of the ROYAL ARCH CHAPTER are supposed to be conducted, is conveyed in the following extracts from Paul's stirring exhortation to the Church at Thessalonica. This passage is statedly used in every Chapter of ROYAL ARCH MASONS:"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"196 THE EOYAL ARCH MASON. \"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received from us.

It was maeh more magnificent than that of the inferior order of priests. A description of it is best given in the words of Scripture : \" And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made clothes of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the Lord com- manded Moses. \"And he made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine-twined linen. \"And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work. \"They made shoulder-pieces for it, to couple it to- gether : by the two edges was it coupled together. \" And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof, of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen ; as the Lord commanded Moses. \"And they wrought onyx-stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. \" And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses. \"And he made the breast-plate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod ; of golc^ blue, and purple, and t, and fine twined linen."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":".200 . THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. \"It was four-square; they made the breast-plate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.\" Exodus, xxxix. In addition to this description, which is elaborated in the subsequent verses, we may add that the ephod con- sisted of two plates, the one covering the back, the other the breast, both being united upon the two shoulders. It is sometimes described as having been thrown over the shoulders and hanging down before, crossed upon the breast. Upon the place where it crossed the breast was the breast-plzlte. This was a piece of embroidered work about ten inches square, with a front and lining to answer as a pouch. It was adorned with precious stones, described below. The upper corners were fastened to the ephod, from which it was not to be loosed : the two lower corners to the girdle. The breast-plate was called the Memorial, because it reminded the priest of his rep- resentative character in relation to the Twelve Tribes, and it was called the Breast-plate of Judgment, prob- ably because worn by him who was instrumentally the fountain of judgment and justice to the Jewish Church. The miter, or head-dress, was formed of eight yards of fine linen in circular folds, and inscribed in front, upon a plate of pure gold, the words \" Holiness to the Lord/' The terms \"Urim and Thummim\" are associated with the breast-plate; but whether they denoted some Divine manifestation made in or upon the breast-plate itself, or whether it was a visible appendage to the breast-plate, indicating its peculiar and sacred use in this respect, is"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"THE ROBES OF THE HIGH-PKIEST. 201 not known. The words literally signify \"Lights and Perfections.\" The utmost that can be satisfactorily known respecting the subject is, that it was a manner or thing through which a knowledge of the Divine will was sought and conveyed. The twelve stones in the breast-plate were a sardius, topaz, carbuncle, the first row; emerald, sapphire, diamond, second row; ligure, agate, amethyst, third row; beryl, onyx, jasper, fourth and lower row. Viewing these grand and enlivening symbolisms, the \"enlightened Freemason can not but wish his lot had been, cast in the days when Freemasons were operative as well as speculative, and when God spoke through the myste- rious TJrim and Thummim as a man speaketh to his neighbor, face to face.

All that can be known of the Temple of Zerubbabel is, that, in style of architecture, it was as nearly as pos- sible a copy of that which had been destroyed by Nebu- chadnezzar nearly ninety years before. This Temple, in general form, resembled the Tabernacle, elaborately de- scribed upon another page. It was a substitute for the Tabernacle, which was only adapted to a wayfaring peo- ple, and was the great center of the same system of ceremonial worship. It was built upon Mount Moriah. This was one summit of a range of hills, ,the general name of which was Mount Sion. Beginning on the north, the ridge bears the name of Bezetha, then Mo- riah, then Ophel, the latter running down to the junc- tion of the ravine termed the Tyropoeon with the valley of Jehoshaphat. Mount Moriah has an altitude of about four hundred feet above the valley on the east. The idea of building a Temple was suggested to the mind of David by the contemplation of his own good fortune, the general state of prosperity to which his country had arrived, and his fraternal relations with the Phoenician King Hiram, whose dominions afforded suit- able wood and his subjects suitable workmen for the edifice. It became to David an object of lively and un- ceasing interest; and although he was not permitted by the Almighty to take a single step in its erection, yet he collected during the latter years of his reign precious metals to the value of many billions of dollars, besides immense quantities of brass, iron, stone, lumber, etc., and secured skillful artificers for every branch of the"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"204 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. work. He also furnished the design, plan, and location o'f the building, in all which he was Divinely instructed. The. superintendence of the building was committed to his wise son Solomon, who in the fourth year of his reign laid the foundation-stone and began the work. Of laborers, native and foreign, there were in all 183,600. 30,000 of these were Jews, who worked in rotation 10,000 a month. 153,600 of them were Phoenicians; viz., 70,000 bearers of burdens, 80,000 hewers in wood and stone, and 3,600 overseers. The parts were all pre- pared at a distance from the site of the building, and when they were brought together, the whole immense structure was erected without the sound of ax, hammer, or any tool of iron. At the end of seven and one-half years it stood complete in all its splendor, the glory of Jerusalem, and the most magnificent edifice in the world. The Temple, like the Tabernacle, had its front toward the east. The porch or portico extended across the whole front, projecting fifteen feet from the main build- ing, and rising to the height of one hundred and eighty feet. Upon the sides and rear of the main building was an additional building of three stories, each nearly eight feet high. This structure was about half the height of the Temple, and, though built against the walls, was not fastened into them. It was divided into apartments like chambers, which opened into the gallery that surrounded it. There was a flight of stairs on the south side which led into the second story, and another leading from the second into the third. The whole building and its en- virons were entered by two courts. The inner court, called the Court before the Temple, or the Court of the Priests, corresponded generally with the Court of the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES UPON MOUNT MORIAII. 205 Tabernacle, as did also the sacred apartments, furniture, and utensils. The Temple of Solomon was destroyed by Nebuchad- nezzar, four hundred and twenty-four years after its completion. A second edifice, in breadth and 'height twice the size of Solomon's, was erected by Zerubbabel, being completed seventy-three years after the destruction of the last. But this lacked five -great essentials of the other; viz., the Ark, the Mercy-seat, the Sacred Fire, the Urim and Thummim, and the visible revelation of the Divine glory, termed the Sheekinah. It was never blessed, either, with the spirit of prophesy like the former. This Temple stood without alteration for nearly five hundred years, when it became much decayed, and Herod the Great undertook its restoration. So large were the alterations made that it was in effect almost a new structure. He began the work seventeen years be- fore Christ, and in less than ten years completed the main edifice, so that it could be occupied. The whole work occupied forty-six years. The dimensions and description of this Temple are recorded in history with considerable minuteness. The outer wall, inclosing the whole, was about one-eighth of a mile square, and stood nearly forty feet about the ground. This wall being built up from the valley be- neath, was, in places, six hundred or even seven hundred feet in height. In these walls were seven massive and costly gates, each fifteen feet wide and thirty high; an additional one in the east, termed the Beautiful Gate, was seventy-five feet high, of the finest metal, highly polished, and richly adorned. Piazzas stood against the wall clear around the hill, supported on the back by the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"206 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. wall itself, in front by a double row of columns ; on the south side the supports were three rows of columns. The porch on the east side was called Solomon's. The larger part of the area within these walls was vacant ground, completely paved with marble, and called the Court of the Gentiles, because all classes of persons were at liberty to enter it; but beyond the wall which separated this from the. next court none but Jews could pass, under penalty of death. The second court was inclosed by a wall, and termed the Court of the Women, because this was the nearest approach to the Temple that women could make, save when they brought a sacrifice. Here was the treasury, and this was the place where some of our Savior's most impressive discourses were delivered. The next court toward the Sanctuary was the Court of Israel. The outer half of this court, which was separated from the inner by a low railing, was entered by common Israelite's to attend upon particular services of religion; but the inner half, next to the Sanctuary, was called the Court of the Priests, into which none save the tribe of Levi could enter, unless when he came to offer his sacri- fice before the altar. Even our Savior, who was of the tribe of Judah, had no privileges here more than the most ordinary Israelite; and wherever it is recorded of him that he entered the Temple, must be understood as confined to the outer part of the Court of Israel. Within the Court of the Priests stood the Altar of Burnt-Offer- ing and the Brazen Laver. Next came the Sanctuary, the materials of which were beautiful and costly beyond description. It was ninety feefc high, ninety feet long, and thirty feet wide, divided"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES UPON MOUNT MORIAH. 207 into two compartments, separated from each other by a curtain or veil. One of these was termed the Holy Place, which occupied sixty feet of the whole length, and in which were the altar of incense, the golden candle- stick, and the table of shew-bread; the other was the Most Holy Place, which measured thirty feet each way. Around the Sanctuary, on all sides except in front, was a structure of three stories high, like that attached to the first Temple, as before described, and a vast Porch extended along the front. The Porch was one hundred and fifty feet long, thirty wide, and at its highest eleva- tion nearly one hundred and eighty feet. The majestic entrance to this Porch was one hundred and thirty-five feet by thirty-seven; it had no door. This Temple was razed to its foundations by the Ro- mans A. D. 70-1, and the site of it was made like a planed field. The present inclosure of Mount Moriah, measured on four sides, is, on the east, 1,523J feet; south, 916; west, 1,600; north, 1,038. The surface of the hill has a gen- eral declination toward the south and east. The walls at their base are about nine feet thick, and average fifty feet in height; at the south-east corner, seventy-seven feet. The walls rise twelve to fifteen feet above the hill. In the east wall is a magnificent gate, fifty -five feet wide, long since closed; no other gate appears in the east or south w r alls. The west wall has eight gates, the north three. There are three principal edifices within the Temple area, all being used for purposes of religion by the Turks. One near the south-western corner is termed Mosque El-Aksa. It is two hundred and eighty feet long by one hundred and eighty-three broad, and at its high-"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"208 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. est rises to about seventy feet. A domed building in the south-east corner is termed Sidna Issa. A number of smaller edifices are along the southern wall. In the center, and traditionally over the site once occupied by the Temples of Solomon, Zerubbabel, and Herod successively, is Kubbet es-Sakhrah, or the Mosque of Omar. This stands upon a marble-paved platform ten feet high, which is ascended through eight portals, of Saracenic style, some of which are truly elegant. The Mosque is one hundred and seventy feet in diameter, and the same in height. The lower story or main body of the building is a true octagon, sixty-seven feet on a side and forty -six feet high; the central and elevated portion is circular. There are four doors and four porches, each facing a cardinal point, the southern one affording the main entrance. Immediately beneath the center of the dome is a singular object, being a portion of the original rock, which every-where else was levelled off when the surface of the mountain was first prepared under the eye of Solomon. This venerable relic, for what purpose left can only be conjectured, is sixty feet long from north to south, and fifty-five broad. Rising five feet above the marble platform, described above, the body of this frag- ment is about fifteen feet high. In its south-east corner is an apartment, chiseled from the solid rock, fifteen feet square and eight feet high, with a roof five feet thick; below this there is reason to believe another such excavation exists, such, perhaps, as the traditions of ROYAL ARCH MASONRY suggest.

These things remind the officers of their power and jurisdiction, warning them not to abuse their position, limiting their jurisdiction, and prescribing their conduct.

A brother of any grade may descant upon the excellence of the Holy Writings as a rule of life, for those writings teach us that, being born upon a level, we should act upon a square, circumscribe our desires within the compass of nature's gifts poured from the horn of Divine plenty. He may learn therefrom to walk uprightly, suffering neither the pressure of poverty nor the avarice of riches to tempt the heart, even for a moment, to swerve from the line of rectitude suspended before them from the center of heaven. The division of time into equal and regular portions is to him a sure rule for securing the greatest good from the opportunities that are daily af- forded him.

THE ARK. In the grades of Most Excellent Master, ROYAL ARCH MASON, and others following, the Ark be- comes a prominent emblem. The original of this was constructed by Moses while on the way from Egypt to Canaan. It was a small chest made for a specific pur- pose, by the express command of Jehovah. It was three feet and nine inches long, two feet and three inches wide, the same in height. It was made of shittim wood, which is the Masonic Acacia, playing so important a part in the drama of the Master Mason, and was covered with plates of gold. A border or crown of gold encircled it near the top, and it was surmounted by the mercy-seat, which was of 'solid gold, and answered the purpose of a cover or lid to the ark. It will be seen by this descrip- tion, which is a literal transcript from Biblical accounts, how unlike the proper form is the Ark usually found in our ROYAL ARCH assemblies. On each end of the mercy- seat was placed a golden image, representing a cherub facing upward and bending down over the Ark. Two wings of gold were attached to the body of the Ark on each side, through which passed the staves or poles that were used in carrying it from place to place. These were made of the same wood with the Ark, and overlaid in the same manner. In the Ark Moses placed a golden pot, containing three quarts of manna ; Aaron's rod, which miraculously bud- ded, blossomed, and yielded fruit at once; and the tables of the testimony, otherwise called the tables of the Ten Commandments. But we learn, from 1 Kings, viii, that"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE ARK. 211 when it was placed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of Solo- man's Temple, \" there was nothing in the Ark, save the two tables of stone.\" On the mercy-seat, which surmounted the Ark, rested the awful and mysterious symbol of the Divine presence. The Temple of Zerubbabel did not contain the Ark. Whether it was seized among the spoils when the city was sacked, or whether it was secreted and afterward destroyed, history does not inform us. The traditions of Freemasonry only partially supply this hiatus in Scrip- ture account. Some comment upon the original contents of the Ark may be expected. The Holy Writings have been alluded to in various parts of this work. As the term was under- stood by Moses, it comprised only the Ten Commandments. As successive additions were made by himself, by Samuel, by Ezra, and perhaps others, the Holy Writings increased in number to embrace thirty-nine different works under the Old Dispensation. The New Testament Scriptures, numbering twenty-seven works, makes the complete cat- alogue of sixty-six. The older portion was conveniently divided by Jewish authors into the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms. In American Lodges and Chapters the connected series of Old and New Testament Scriptures are always used; but the opened pages are invariably in the Old Testament. An account of the loss of the Holy Writings during the later years of the Jewish monarchy,^ and of their recovery under the good king Josiah, is given in 2 Chronicles, xxxiv. The Pot of Manna is re- ferred to in Exodus, xvi: \"Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"212 THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. wherewith I have kept you in the wilderness when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the testimony, to be kept.\" This manna was a substance miraculously furnished to the children of Israel on their journey through the wil- derness, and designed as a substitute for bread, the ma- terial for which they could not raise during their journey- ings. It is called \"the bread rained from heaven.\" The most remarkable things about the manna of the Israelites were, that double the quantity was supplied on the sixth day of the week, so that no one need break the Sabbath by going out in search of it; that on the Sabbath no manna fell from heaven ; and that what they kept from the sixth to the seventh day remained sweet, while that kept from any other became offensive. All three of these miracles were wrought to attest the sanc- tity of the Sabbath. It is described as a small, round thing, as small as the hoar-frost on the ground, like co- riander-seed, white, and the taste of it like wafers made with honey. It was ground in mills or beaten in a mor- tar, then placed in pans, in the shape of cakes, and baked. In gathering this food, each person was permitted to take what was necessary for his own use, not exceeding an omer, or about three quarts, for each member the family. If more was collected, the surplus was distributed to those who had less. For forty years this miraculous supply of food was furnished daily to between three and four millions of people.

Soon do the buds of infancy bloom on the cheek of youth; soon are the blossoms of time succeeded by the fruits of eternity. THE KEY. The emblem of the Key may be improved to impress upon the mind of a ROYAL ARCH MASON the importance of those secrets which have been transmitted through thirty centuries, amidst bitter persecutions, for the benefit of the Sons of Light. As we have thus received them, untarnished by the touch of profane curiosity, and un- impaired by the revolution of time and human events, so must we deliver them, in all their purity and perfection, to the brethren who shall come after us, confident that they will never be divulged to the unworthy. The Key is an emblem often referred to in Scripture. THE THREE SQUARES. Allusion has been made upon another page to the use of these emblems. The traditions of Freemasonry are uniform, that the greatest possible care was exercised at the building of the Temple of Solomon, that every block should be made of exact dimensions to fill a specified place in the wall. Nor was it left to the fidelity and vigilance of one man, or the skill and implement of one man, to decide upon this; three persons at least passed"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"214 THE ROYAL ARCH' MASOH. judgment upon every ashlar before it went into the hands of him who was to cement it within the wall. The emblematical application of this is too apparent to need explanation. In practice no person can be ad- mitted a member of the Masonic Order in any grade until he has passed the trying square of every person present at the ballot-test; a single objection would be fatal to his admission. THE WORKING TOOLS. Since the fiat of Heaven has gone forth, In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, it becomes us cheerfully to submit, laboring industriously in our respective call- ings. Labor is honorable, and to none more so than those who properly comprehend the theory of this grade. The pickax, crowbar, and spade are emblems suggesting to our minds the source from which come our food, me- tallic wealth, fuel, and other necessaries of life. They remind us, too, that we are of the earth, earthy, and that our bodies, when the purpose is accomplished for which we were placed on earth, will return to dust. THE FAITHFUL REMEMBRANCE.

Upon being informed of this, Abraham gathered what force was at his command, pursued the marauders, over- took them at Hobah, north of Damascus, and rescued Lot out of their hands. Returning to his abode, near Hebron, he was saluted, as he passed by Jerusalem, with blessings and good cheer from the venerable Melchisedec, Priest of the Most High God, who abode there. It has ever been one of the hidden problems of Scripture his- tory who this man was, a mystery still further obscured by the strange language of Paul, who, in Hebrews vii, describes him, in symbolical terms, as \"without father, without mother, without descent, having neither begin- ning of days nor end of life.\" But the theory that Melchisedec was Shem, the oldest son of Noah, who is supposed to have been alive at this period, has able sup- porters, and is the most likely of all.

THE VAULTS UNDER THE TEMPLE. It has ever been a tradition among Jewish writers, and woven into various Masonic Degrees, that the hill termed Moriah, upon which the Temple stood, is exca- vated in vaults for mysterious purposes. Travelers, from Bishop Arculf, who visited Jerusalem near the close of the sixth century, down to the present time, have given tales of the native residents embodying allusions to this fact, but no one has furnished the world with a distinct account until within a few years. Dr. James T. Barclay, an American missionary, first discovered the opening to an immense series of excavations, which he has described in his City of the Great King, published in 1858. These caves open near the Damascus Gate, in the north- ern wall of the city, the entrance being under the wall, which is ten feet thick. The outer apartment is more than one thousand feet in diameter, the rock being all quarried out by art, and used doubtless in the construc- tion of the city, the walls, and the Temple. Many blocks are still lying upon the floor of the quarry, squared and prepared for the builders' hands ; others are partly cut from the wall, as if the workmen were called away before their task was finished. This quarry being considerably higher in its lowest place than the ground upon which the Temple stood, explains a ready method for moving down by a gentle descent the heavy material used in that work. The work of quarrying was apparently effected by an instrument resembling a pick -ax, with a broad, chisel-shaped end, as the spaces between the blocks were not more than four inches wide, in which it would be"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"THE VAULTS UNDER THE TEMPLE. 221 impossible for a man to work with a chisel and mallet. After being cut away at each side arid at the bottom, a lever was probably inserted, and the combined force of three or four men could easily pry the block away from the rock behind. The stone is extremely soft and fria- ble, nearly white, and very easily worked, but, like the stone of Malta and Paris, it hardens upon exposure. The marks of the cutting-instrument are as plainly defined as if the workman had but just ceased from his labor. The extreme length of this quarry, as far as explored, from the city wall, is not less than a quarter of a mile. Under the site of the Temple are excavations remain- ing as remarkable as the building itself. Perhaps every portion of the Sacred Hill is thus undermined, although up to the present period only a portion has been ex- plored. In the south-west corner of the Hill there is a broad avenue under ground, two hundred and fifty-nine feet long, forty- two wide, and thirty high. At the end of this, a flight of nine steps leads downward to another hall, fifty feet long and forty wide, supported in the cen- ter by a pillar cut from a single stone, twenty-one feet high and six in diameter. It is probable that further galleries will be found connecting this cavern with others upon the hills westward. In the south-east cor- ner is a series of caves, including a vault, supported by fifteen rows of columns, making an apartment three hundred and nineteen feet by two hundred and fifty. Immediately under the ancient Temple is a cave twenty feet by six, near which, at the depth of sixty or seventy feet, is a cistern capable of holding two million gallons of water!

Then will be seen that the traditions of Freemasonry, which so Jong preserved important topographical, architectural, and religious knowledge concerning the ancient Hill, are well founded, and it is not beyond the bounds of credi- bility that discoveries await us as important in the ad- vancement of Masonic Science as in general information."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"THE THIRD ORDER Uf FREEMASONRY.

THE THEORY OF THE DEGREE OF ROYAL MASTER. THE Degree of ROYAL MASTER is the beginning of a third series, of which the Symbolical Degrees and the Capitular or Chapitral Degrees -are the first two. As a distinctive title, that of Cryptic Degrees has been gen- erally adopted, as referring to the introduction of caves- or caverns peculiar to this system. The Ritual is simple, but expressive. The introduction of the Cryptic De- grees into this country dates from a period about twenty years subsequent to that of the Royal Arch. The rule was then established that none but Royal Arch Masons should receive it. As a grade, it is preparatory to that of Select Master, bearing the same relation to it which the Degree of Entered Apprentice bears to that of Fel- low Craft. Its means of recognition are used as a con- venient and expeditious method of examining a Royal Arch Companion. The title of the organization in which the Degrees of Royal and Select Master are conferred, is Council of Royal and Select Masters.

Mr. Cole informs us that in 1817 the Degree of ROYAL MASTER was \" considered as merely preparatory, and usually conferred immediately before the solemn cere- mony of exaltation to the Royal Arch.\" At that period it was conferred with the Degree of \"Ark Master or Noachite,\" both being considered of equal authority. The latter has become obsolete in this country. PRAYER. The frequent repetition of prayer, in all the Masonic grades, is peculiarly calculated to impress the memory with our constant obligation to piety and devo- tion. Were the benefactions of Providence but partially or unfrequently enjoyed, perhaps we might forget that return of gratitude which is the only remuneration in our power to make ; but his benefits are new every morning and fresh every moment, and surely our per- petual thanksgiving should ascend to heaven. The voice of the Temple the tidings of love, That speaks of the Master who reigneth above; His glory, His glory in the highest who dwells, And Good-will to man, is the burden it tells. Come, Brethren, in chorus, Prolong the glad tidings, No duty so sweet as the hymning of God; His faith each professing, His knowledge possessing, Exalt each the blessing His grace hath bestowed.

Yet the outside world are not to suppose that the mere possession of a few private formulas of word and gesture are sufficient to entitle a person to conceive himself a brother. No. These are but the sequalce of initiation. The whole system is far more elaborate, comprising a petition for initiation, avouchals, and rec- ommendations, cautious inspection of moral character, and of physical and mental qualifications, the ballot thorough and secret, the reception traditional and im- pressive, and a series of covenants, than which noth- ing can be better devised to bind the conscience of a man to good thoughts and good works. These, accom- panied with elaborate ritualisms, lead, in the end, to the communication of appropriate means of recognition, so arranged that while they suggest to the memory the peculiar secrets of the grade, are a constant reminder of its covenants and duties, and the punishment sym- bolically predicted of those who willfully violate and neg- lect them. The means of recognition may be compared, in their unchangeableness and allegorical character, to the Pil- lars of King Solomon's Porch. The raising Pillars and Obelisks was a custom of the eastern nations, and of Egypt in particular; the use of which, we are told, was to record the extent of dominion and the tributes of nations subject to the Egyptian empire, etc., or in com- memoration of memorable events. Diodorus tells us that Sesostris signalized his reign by the erection of two"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"SCRIPTURAL REFERENCES. 231 obelisks, which were cut with a design to acquaint pos- terity of the extent of his power, and the number of the nations he had conquered. Augustus, according to the report of Pliny, transported one of these obelisks to Rome, and placed it in the Campus Martius. Pliny says the Egyptians were the first devisers of such move- ments, and that Mestres, King of Heliopolis, erected the first. Marsham and others attribute the invention to Sesostris. The obelisk of Shannesis exceeded all that had preceded it; Constantine, and Constans, his son, caused it to be moved to Rome, where it remains, the noblest piece of Egyptian antiquity existing in the world. Solomon had pursued this custom in erecting his pillars in the porch of the Temple, which he designed should be a memorial to the Jews as they entered the Holy Place, to warn their minds with confidence and faith by this record of the promises made by the Lord unto his father David, and which were repeated unto him in a vision, in which the voice of God proclaimed, \"I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for- ever.\" SCRIPTURAL REFERENCES. The use of Scriptural pas sages in the Rituals of Masonry has a twofold applica- tion. It conveys to the initiate the peculiar instructions of the grade, often in the most forcible and direct man- ner, while it gives a clue to the memory in recalling the means of recognition. In this double sense the follow- ing passages are appropriate to the degree of ROYAL MASTER : \"And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"232 THE KOYAL MASTER. dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. . \"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain : for the for- mer things are passed away. \" And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. \" And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.

THE consideration of the Cherubim as the most sacred emblem in the Mosaic Ceremonial is a part of the Rituals of the ROYAL MASTER. A group of Cherubims, in allu- sion to those that stood in the Holy of Holies, forms a proper emblem of this grade. The Cherub was a figure composed of various creatures, as a man, an ox, an eagle, or a lion. The first mention of the Cherubs is in Gene- sis, iii, 24, where the figure is not described; but their office was, with a flaming sword, to keep or guard the way of the tree of life. The two Cherubs which Moses was commanded to make, at the ends of the mercy-seat, were to be of beaten work of gold; and their wings were to extend over the mercy-seat, their faces toward each other, and between them was the residence of the Deity. (Ex- odus, xxv.) The Cherubs in Bzekiel's vision had each four heads or faces, the hands of a man and wings. The"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"234 THE ROYAL MASTER. four faces were the face of a bull, that of a man, that of a lion, and that of an eagle. They had the likeness of a man. (Ezekiel, iv and ix.) In 2 Samuel, xxii, 11, and Psalm xviii, Jehovah is represented as riding on a Cherub and flying on the wings of the wind. In the ce- lestial hierarchy Cherubs are represented as spirits next in order to Seraphs. The hieroglyphical and emblem- atical figures embroidered on the veils of the Tabernacle are called Cherubs of curious or skillful work. (Exo- dus, xxvi.) The Scriptural accounts of the position of the Cheru- bims are precise : \"He set the Cherubims within the inner-house: and they stretched forth the wings of the Cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other Cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.\" 1 Kings, vi. This should be an accurate guide to ROYAL MASTERS in the use of this emblem in their Lodges. THE THOUGHT OF DEATH. There is no portion of the Ritual of ROYAL MASTER so impressive as the solemn thought of death, so aptly introduced. \" The young may die, the old must die,\" is said with an impressiveness that is very affecting. To the most of men the end of life is anticipated with horror, insomuch that thousands of mankind would relinquish the opportunity of gaining an inheritance \" incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away,\" if the present life could be immortal.

He anticipates a season of rest and relief from mortal labors, when the grosser implements of sublunary arts shall be suspended in the desolated halls of mortality that the harps of angels may employ his hands forever. There, there will be no more occasion for level or plumb-line, for trowel or gavel, for compass or square. On the perfect level of eternity neither weakness nor envy will jeopardize the good man's bright career, nor will he need an emblem of rec- titude while the example of sister-spirits is ever before him. The cement of heavenly love will be spread by the hand of Deity, and no imperfection will require the force of art to remove it. Infinitely broad will be the circle of duty, and no brother will be disposed to over- leap its boundaries, for all will be kept within the angle of perfection by Him who is able \" to keep us from fall- ing\" and present us faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy.

The Biblical narrative concern- ing this remarkable man is as follows : \"And Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. \"He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cun- ning to work all works in brass. And he came to Solo- mon, and wrought all his work.\" 1 Kings, vii. \" Now I have sent a cunning man, endued with under- standing, of Huram my father's. \" The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson ; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.\" 2 Chronicles, ii.

In this view, he was the most remarkable man, considered as a prac- tical mechanic, or, as the Scriptures term it, \" cunning workman,\" that the world ever produced. It is as nat- ural to attribute to the Divine Providence the great qualities of the Builder Hiram as those of the Monarch Solomon; and it is difficult to see how such a work could have been constructed at all but for his superin- tendence. The Scriptures and Church traditions are silent as to the ultimate history of the \"cunning workman.\" Tra- ditions connected with the apocryphal systems of \" the Scotch Rite\" describe him as returning to Phoenicia and constructing various temples after the completion of Solomon's, but the tradition of the Master Mason's De- gree is positive that he did not outlive the completion of his clief-d'cewvre upon Mount Moriah. The circum- stances of his death, as detailed in the Master's Lodge, are particularly interesting to the ROYAL MASTER, who is made acquainted with many amiable traits of his char- acter, and exhorted to use him as a model of piety, industry, and fidelity to truth. In the capacity of a model, \"the Widow's Son\" is the most prominent figure in the Masonic Rituals. Every thing connected with his career while at Jerusalem his wonderful assiduity to business, his frugality, his artistic skill, his accuracy in adapting means to ends, his modesty in his daily con- tact with kings, his unflinching attachment to discipline, without which so great a work must have miscarried, and, best of all, his fidelity to his trust as a speculative"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"THE CUNNING WORKMAN. 239 workman in a structure that was to survive the ruin of the Temple and the nation all these are traits in the model character of Hiram.

It may, and often does, sub- serve the interests of the Cross, but can never fill its place or answer its ends. So far from setting up any such pretensions, it distinctly and unequivocally avows the contrary; and he who trusts to the moral power of Freemasonry for the revolution of his moral nature, the subjugation of his evil passions, arid for a blissful im- mortality, poorly understands the ground-work of the Order, and works a fatal, unpardonable fraud upon himself."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"THE SELECT MASTER. 16"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"AT MIDNIGHT AS AT NOON.

THE FELLOW CRAFT. This is the complement of the preceding Degree; it is the Apprentice turned Jour- neyman. Not less than five must be associated together in a Lodge to confer it. The theory of it is ability to shape perfect work. The working tools or practical sym- bols are the Plumb, Square, and Level. The instruc- tions are the Attentive Ear, the Instructive Tongue, and the Faithful Breast. 3. THE MASTER MASON. This is the governing Grade of the two preceding; it is the Fellow Craft placed in command of his fellows. Not less than three must be associated together in a Lodge to confer it. The theory of it is ability to govern in the love and fear of God. The working tool or practical symbol is the Trowel. The instructions are Friendship, Morality, and Brotherly Love. 4. THE MARK MASTER. This is the complement, in ritualism, of the Fellow Craft; it is the Fellow Craft made skillful. Not less than eight must be associated together in a Lodge to ^confer it. The theory of it is good labor merits good ivages. The working tools or practical symbols are the Chisel and Mallet. 5. THE PAST MASTER. This is the governing Grade of the four preceding; it is the Master Mason fitted to command a Lodge or many Lodges. Not less than three must be associated together in a Lodge to confer it."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"SKETCH OF NINE DEGREES. 245 The theory of it is that a Masonic governor has three guides to discipline; viz., the Law of God, the Grand Lodge Constitution, and the By-Laws of his own Lodge. 6. THE MOST EXCELLENT MASTER. This is closely connected with the Master Mason's Grade. Not less than two must be associated together in a Lodge to confer it. The theory of it is fervent devotion to God.

This is a continuation of the Master Mason; it is the Master Mason placed under circumstances of exile, hard pilgrimage, persecu- tion, and excessive labor. Not less than nine must asso- ciate together in a Chapter to confer it. The theory of it is unbounded devotion to God. The working tools, or practical symbols are the Pickax, Spade, and Crow- bar. The instructions are Freedom, Fervency, and Zeal. 8. THE ROYAL MASTER. This is a recurrence to the Grade of Fellow Craft; it is the Fellow Craft urgent for more light. Not less than nine nor more than twenty- seven must associate together in a Council to confer it. The theory of it is ardent cravings for Masonic instruc- tion. 9. THE SELECT MASTER.

The working tools or practical emblems, both for this and the preceding grade, are the Trowel within the Triangle. To sum up the theories, or central rays, of these nine grades, they are: 1. Trial and moral discipline. 2. Ability to shape perfect work. 3. Ability to govern in the love and fear of God. 4. Good labor merits good wages. 5. The three fundamental guides to discipline. 6. Fervent devotion to God. 7. Unbounded devotion to God. 8. Ardent cravings for Masonic instruction. 9. Justice and mercy at accord. These are all good lessons, whose contemplation can not fail to improve the mind, soften the heart, restrain prejudices, increase the virtues, and fit the soul for higher labors in the Lodge above. In each Degree, the necessity and duty of prayer are impressed upon the mind of the novitiate, being as clearly important to the aged as to the young, on the borders of the grave as in the flower of manhood. It was pointed out to man, in the earliest ages of the world, as a suitable medium of communion between earth and heaven. It was the \"Ladder of the Patriarch,\" on which angels descend to minister to the happiness of men. Its three rounds are adapted to the flight of the soul to its immortal man- sions. Its benefits are immeasurable, and its obligatory force is commensurate with probationary being. It can never be useless or unimportant, till we have passed through the veils to repose on the bosom of our Maker."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"COVENANTS-RECOGNITIONS-QUALIFICATIONS. 247 COVENANTS. There is also to each grade a series of Covenants, of which, in the cautious spirit of American Masonry, we can say but little. They are derived from Holy Writ, strongly enjoined upon the novitiate, and repeated with variations of language and sentiment in each Degree. They are such as none but a conscien- tious man, walking and working in the fear of God, can keep. RECOGNITIONS. In these grades there is also a series of methods of recognition, arrangements of tests, words, gestures, etc., by which the brethren of the respective Degrees may mutually examine and be examined for all the purposes of the society, without liability to error. Of these, no more can be said in print. QUALIFICATIONS. A general summary of the qualifi- cations requisite to admission into any of these nine grades is thus given : It is formed out of the antiquated documents of Freemasonry extant, especially the '\"An- cient Charges,\" a publication, the oldest in Masonic science, made by authority of the Grand Lodge of Eng- land, in 1723. An applicant for the honors and privi- leges, the duties and responsibilities of Masonry, must be: 1. A Man. \"No woman.\" 2. Free, and Free-born. \"No bondman.\" \"The owner of a bondman might otherwise seize him, even in the Lodge.\" \"Free-born.\" \"No bondsman.\" 3. Of suitable age. \" Of mature and discreet age.\" 4.

Born in honest wedlock. \"No bastard.\" \"De- scended of honest parents.''\" \"Of a good kindred.\" \"Of honest parentage.\" 6. Of good public estimation. \"Of good report.\" \"No man under evil report.\" \"Ignorance would dis- credit the Craft.\" \" Honor is to be done to the Frater- nity by itinerant Masons.\" \"False oaths would bring disgrace upon Masonry.\" \"No persons shall be ac- cepted a Freemason but such as are of good reputa- tion.\" 7. Perfect in body. \"A perfect youth, having no maim or defect in his body.\" \"On no account receive a mutilated person.\" \"His limbs must be quite entire and shapely ; it would be a stigma upon the Fraternity to initiate a halt or lame man.\" \" Of limbs whole, as a man ought to be.\" \"Able in all degrees, having his right limbs, as a man ought to have.\" \" Of able body.\" 8. Of good mental powers. \" If the Master discover that he is a Craftsman not so perfect as he should be, let him be at once discharged.\" \"The Apprentice must be thoroughly instructed in the various points of the Masonic science.\" \"He must keep the secrets intrusted to him.\" 9. Submissive to Masonic rule. \"Willing to serve seven years.\" \"An Apprentice must serve for smaller wages than a Fellow Craft.\" \"He must exercise meek-"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"THEORY OF THE DEGREE OF SELECT MASTER. 249 ness.\" \"He must avoid discord and contention.\" \"He must be constrained to appear wheresoever he is sum- moned.\" \"If he in any wise contend against the or- dinances of the Grand Lodge, he shall be made a sub- ject of Masonic punishment.\" \"He shall conceal and hide.\" From this summary, the entire code of Masonic dis- cipline and duty may be deduced. Nothing more per- fect has ever been presented by human hands for hu- man adoption, and so long as the labors of the Craft are performed upon this model, the Masonic Institution will stand a monument, from age to age, of social ties, mutual benefit, and moral perfection. THE THEORY OF THE DEGREE OF SELECT MASTER. The Degree of SELECT MASTER is the ninth and last of the series contemplated in the present volume. Be- yond it, there is one Degree in the Chivalric System, termed the Red-Gross Knight, which bears the same re- lation to the Royal Arch that the Royal Master's De- gree bears to the SELECT MASTER. But our present plan excludes it from this volume. The Degree of SELECT MASTER, in beauty and im- pressiveness, does not lose in comparison with any other named in the present volume. Its drama is peculiarly interesting, suggesting to the mind the greatest doctrine of the Holy Scriptures; viz., the blending of mercy with justice. Mr. Webb's discription of it is as follows: \"This Degree is the summit and perfection of .ancient Masonry; and without which, the history of the Royal"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"250 THE SELECT MASTER. Arch can not be complete. It rationally accounts for the concealment and preservation of those essentials of the Craft which were brought to light at the erection of the second Temple, and which lay concealed from the Masonic eye four hundred and seventy years. Many particulars relative to those few who, for their superior skill, were selected to complete an important part of King Solomon's Temple are explained. And here, too, is ex- emplified an instance of justice and mercy by our ancient Patron toward one of the Craft, who was led to disobey his commands by an over-zealous attachment for the in- stitution. It ends with a description of a particular cir- cumstance which characterizes the Degree.\" Mr. Cole describes the Degree of SELECT MASTER as \"filling up a chasm which every intelligent Royal Arch Mason has observed. Without it, it seems difficult, if not impossi- ble, to comprehend clearly some of the mysteries that belong to the august Degree of Royal Arch.\" He adds : \" Such is the nature of this Degree, that we can not feel freedom to allude remotely to the nature of its secrets; we may, however, pronounce it the Key to the Arch.\" In 1817 it was conferred only in the city of Baltimore, Maryland, where it ranked as the Fifth Degree in the series, following next to that of Mark Master. In a sub- sequent page, Mr. Cole says : \" Without the Degree of SELECT MASTER, that of Royal Arch discovers to the strict inquirer a chasm, the bottom of which, notwith- standing its native and artificial brilliancy, is enveloped in darkness.\" So much being said in all the Degrees of Craft Ma- sonry relative to the city of Jerusalem, it will be proper here to give a more complete account of that remarka-"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"THEORY OF THE DEGREE OF SELECT MASTER. 251 ble place. Its history surpasses in vicissitudes that of any other upon earth. Seventeen times has it been destroyed and rebuilt. Every nation that has risen in the Oriental world, for nearly four thousand years, has invested and captured Jerusalem, and in turn yielded it to succeeding spoilers. The first notice that history affords us of this remarkable place, is in the account of Abraham pursuing the four kings to Hobah, and rescu- ing his nephew Lot from their hands. Returning to Hebron, which was his residence, he was met in the Vale of Shaveh by Melchizedek, the king of Salem, to whom he paid tithes of the spoil he had captured. At the same time he received from that prince a blessing, even the blessing of the Most High God, together with such refreshments as his wearied party needed. . Upon the conquest of Palestine by Joshua, Jerusalem was cast to the lot of Benjamin ; but the warriors of that tribe failing to seize it from the Jebusites, it fell to the people of Judah, upon whose boundary-line it stood, and whose superior prowess, under king David, wrested it from the hands of the enemy. David made it the Royal City and Metropolis of his kingdom. His son Solomon erected that wonderful and mysterious edifice, the Temple, upon its eastern eminence, Mount Moriah, and in the division of the kingdom, under Rehoboam, it remained the Me- tropolis of the Kingdom of Judah. In the day of its highest splendor and prosperity its population exceeded a million of souls. The Jewish cer- emonial requiring all the people to appear in the Temple three times a year, Jerusalem was ever a thronged city and the great inland mart of the nation. The surround- ing hills, being terraced and irrigated, were covered with"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"252 THE SELECT MASTER. the fruitful things of that latitude, grains, figs, olives and vines. The cattle grazed upon the thousand hills, affording food, clothing, and wealth to the inhabit- ants. But glorious as was the temporal prosperity shared with Tyre, Sidon, the cities of Egypt, and other flourish^ ing emporiums, Jerusalem was more fortunate than any, in being the residence, the earthly home, of the Most High God. Jehovah, who had answered the supplica- tions of King Solomon in the Fire and the Cloud, condescended to abide upon the Mercy-seat under the cherubim, in the Most Holy Place. By oracles, by the mystic Urim and Thummim, by visions, voices, and dreams, he answered the prayers of the faithful through the Divinely-ordained Priesthood, and made his presence known to those who rightly sought him. This fact, well understood by the pious Jews, made Jerusalem the \"joy of the whole earth\" to them. It was the Sacred City, the one spiritual oasis in a wilderness of heathen super- stititions and impiety. From hence came forth the law. The Psalms of David were promulgated from this city. Ezra collated and composed the sacred canon here. Here for hundreds of years stood up, east of the Porch of the Temple, the grand pillars, Jachin and Boaz, the wonder and admiration of all beholders ; an assurance to all, in their very names, that in strength God had cove- nanted to establish the honor, the city, the kingdom, the law forever, provided Israel would continue to serve him as their Lawgiver and Ruler. Such, then, was the City of the Great King; the per- fection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth. But, alas! how great has been her fall ! How doth the city sit sol-"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"CRYPTIC MASONRY. 253 itary that was full of people ! how is she become as a widow ! Reft of thy sons, amid thy foes forlorn, Mourn, widowed Queen ! forgotten Sion, mourn ! Is this thy place, sad city, this thy throne, Where the wild desert rears its craggy stone Where suns, unblest, their angry luster fling, And way-worn pilgrims seek the scanty spring? Where now thy pomp, which kings with envy viewed? Where now thy might, which all these kings subdued? No martial myriads muster in thy gate : No suppliant nations in thy temple wait; No prophet-bards, thy glittering courts among, Wake the full lyre, and swell the tide of song; But lawless force and meager want are there, And the quick, darting eye of restless fear; While cold oblivion, mid thy ruins laid, Folds his dark wing beneath the ivy shade. Jerusalem, now for more than a thousand years in possession of the infidel, is a miserable town, of less than ten thousand inhabitants, possessing not a wreck of its former glory. Temple, brazen pillars, palaces, all are gone. The very surface of the earth upon which pressed the feet of prophets, priests, and kings, is buried, in places, fifty feet deep beneath the debris of the former city, and, with the exception of a few great stones in the foundation- walls about Mount Moriah, it is impossible to point to an object fashioned by the hand of man, and affirmed with certainty, \" this is the handiwork of the men of Solomon.\" CRYPTIC MASONRY. The term \" Cryptic Masonry,\" as applied to the two Degrees of the Council, is derived more especially from the SELECT MASTER.

It is a pleasant tradition, illustrating this de- partment, that the body of the Wi&e King yet lies en- tombed within a crypt, in the bowels of the Sacred Mountain, and that his spirit is permitted to wander forth at midnight, and to visit for one hour the places made memorable by his wisdom, valor, benevolence, or piety, during his lifetime. Among all these, however, there is none which his spirit haunts with such tenacity as working Lodges of Freemasons. Wherever Gavels ring or Jewels gleam, past the midnight hour, the spirit of Solomon is. found, not visible to the eye, but appar- ent, it is said, to the well-informed, by the enlarged spirit of brotherly love animating .every breast. The following lines illustrate the thought: KING SOLOMON'S MIDNIGHT VISIT. IN a deep, rocky Cave great King Solomon lies, Sealed up till the judgment from all prying eyes: The Square on his breast, and his kingly brow crowned, His Gavel and Scepter with filletings wound ; At midnight, impatient, his spirit comes forth, And haunts for a season the places of earth. He flits like a thought to the chambers of kings; To the plain where black battle has shaken his wings; To the cave where the student his late vigil keeps; To the cell where the prisoner hopelessly weeps : But most where Freemasons their mystical round Continue past midnight, King Solomon 's found. ^ 0, then when the bell tolls low tivelve, do we hear A rustling, a whispering startle the ear ;"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"THE TWENTY-SEVEN WORKMEN. 255 A deep solemn murmur, while Crafts stand in awe, At something the eye of a mortal ne'er saw; We know it, we feel it, we welcome the King, Whose spirit takes part in the anthem we sing.

THE TWENTY-SEVEN WORKMEN. In the ranks of the faithful, whose biography is given with more or less minuteness in. the Holy Scriptures, there are Twenty-seven names especially worthy the reverence of SELECT MASTERS. They are named below in the order of their lives. Each in his day performed his part, Trowel in hand, girded about with white rai- ment as becometh the faithful of God, to spread the ce- ment upon the walls of moral architecture, and each is embalmed in the memory of all who revere virtue and fortitude devoted to a holy calling. 1. ADAM. His birth was cotemporaneous with the creation of the world; he was the last and noblest of God's works. The victim of temptation, he was ban- ished from Eden and condemned to a toilsome lot, which"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"250 THE SELECT MASTER. he bore patiently, and thus, by faith in a coming Mes- siah, was reinstated in the favor of God. He died B. C. 8074, aged 930 years. 2. ABEL. Born B. C. 4001, he met with a shocking death at his brother's hands at the age of 126 years. In his meekness, his piety, attention to religious duty, and undeserved death, he is an emblem of 'one \" whose blood speaketh better things than that of Abel.\" 3. ENOCH. Born B. C. 3382, he was translated be- yond the persecutions of his enemies to the land of per- petual peace at the age of 365 years. \"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found because God had translated him ; for before his translation he had his testimony that he pleased God.' 3 4. NOAH. Born B. C. 2948, this godly man, \" being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness which is by faith.\" He survived the flood 349 years, dying at the age of 950 years. 5. ABRAHAM. This memorable character, the founder of the Jewish nation, was born in Chaldea, B. C. 1996, and died near Hebron, in Canaan, at the age of 175 years. \"When called to go into a place which he should afterward receive for an inheritance, he obeyed; for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.\""},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"THE TWENTY-SEVEN WORKMEN. 257 6. ISAAC. Born in the patriarchal abode at Beersheba, B. C. 1896, he lived a peaceable and quiet life, in the constant exercise of charity and benevolence, and died aged 180 years. 7. JACOB. Born B. C. 1836, he lived a life of great vicissitudes, suffering much from the consequences of his own sins and the evil conduct of his children, yet ever trusting in God for pardon, and died in Egypt, in the arms of his beloved son Joseph, aged 147 years. 8. JOSEPH. Born in Padan Aram, B. C. 1746, he was sold by his brothers as a slave, at the age of 17 years ; was taken to Egypt and became its governor at the youthful age of 30. A model son and brother, he brought down all his relatives to Egypt, where he pro- vided for their support, and died at the age of 110 years. 9. MOSES. Born in a state of servitude in Egypt, B. C. 1571, he became at the age of 80 the. Lawgiver and Captain of his people, whom he conducted by an arduous and devious route to the land of their fathers, and expired on Mount Pisgah, in view of the Promised Land, at the age of 120 years. 10. AARON. Born in Egypt, B. C. 1574, he was the Deputy and Spokesman of his greater brother Moses; assisted him in conducting the people and putting into operation their new laws and ceremonials, and died upon Mount Hor, in Edom, at the age of 122 years. 17"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"258 THE SELECT MASTER. 11. JOSHUA. Born in Egypt, B. C. 1553, lie accom- panied the spies from Kadesh Barnea into Canaan, was faithful amidst all disasters, and upon the death of Moses took command of the hosts of Israel, and accom- plished the conquest of Palestine within about six years. He died, aged 110 years. 12. CALEB. Born in Egypt, his career resembled that of Joshua. He was one of the spies who brought a good report to Moses. In the conquest of Canaan he fought a good fight, and was allotted Hebron and its surroundings for his inheritance. 13. BARAK. A deliverer of Israel from the grievous oppressions of Sisera, he ruled his people in the fear of God for forty years. 14. GIDEON. A follower in the chivalrous career of Barak, he rescued his country from the Midianites in a great battle at the well Harod, striking boldly in the name of the Lord. 15. JEPHTHAH. The third in this band of national deliverers, he drove back the Ammonites, achieving a decisive victory at Aroer, and by his piety and valor gave peace to Israel, whom he ruled for six years. 16. SAMUEL. Born at Ramathaim Zophim, B. C. 1155, he became the most eminent prophet and priest since the days of Moses. From early youth he had access to God, and by successive communications derived the Di- vine will by which he ruled his people Israel."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"THE TWENTY-SEVEN WORKMEN. 259 17. DAVID. Born at Bethlehem, B. C. 1085, he was from his youth \" a man after God's own heart.\" Though at times overcome by temptation, his sins were not presump- tuous ; he submitted patiently to punishment, and poured forth his penitence and thanksgiving in his deathless Psalms. He died at the age of 71 years, and was buried on Mount Sion, where his sepulcher is shown to this day. 18. SOLOMON. Born B. C. 1033, he is the Founder of Speculative Masonry or Freemasonry, of which his Temple on Mount Moriah was equally the spiritual and the practical model. He was emphatically the Wise King, the Moralist, the Royal Patron of Science and the Arts. Eed into shocking follies, his old age recalled him to a purer life, and he died, it may be hoped, in the prospect of a better world. 19. HIRAM, KING OF TYRE. The royal friend and provider of King Solomon, the Great Temple at Jerusa- lem was equally indebted to his munificent procurement of materials and his experienced skill in their distribu- tion. 20. HIRAM, THE BUILDER. The Operative Grand Master and companion of two kings, was \"a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, filled with all wisdom and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass; skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"2(JO THE SELECT MASTER. to him.\" This is the man whose noble death in defense of his integrity stands as a Masonic example to all ages. 21. ADONIRAM. This man was the royal Treasurer of Solomon, and an active participant in the erection of the mystic temple of Freemasonry. 22. ELIJAH. The Tishbite of Gilead stands fore- most in the Old Testament Scriptures for nearness of access to the throne of Deity, for boldness of approach to kings, for powers of enduring hunger, thirst, and fa- tigue when upon the mission of God, and for the splen- dor of his departure, on one of the summits of Abarim, a in a chariot of fire and with horses of fire.\" 23. ELISHA. The son of Shaphat, of Abel Meholath, became the successor -of Elijah and the possessor of his mantle. . He enjoyed, like him, the manifest favor of God. His miraculous powers proved his favor with Deity, which he ever exerted for the benefit of suffering humanity. In his day the nation of Israel, long divided into two king- doms, was fast hastening, by a course of idolatry and sin, to its own destruction, an event that might be de- layed, but could not be prevented by all the efforts of these prophets. 24. ZERUBBABEL. A prince of the house of David, one of the captivity, who had kept his apron unspotted during the years of his exile, it was his happy portion to lead back the first portion of Judah to the land of their fathers.

C. 515, seventy-three years after its destruction. 25. EZRA. Coming from Babylon to Jerusalem, he was made governor, B. C. 457, and acted in that capac- ity for twelve years. He then became engaged in col- lecting and publishing the Jewish Scriptures, and restor- ing the purity of the Jewish worship. 26. JUDAS MACCABEUS. Made governor of Judea, B. C. 166, this man was the last of a long array of holy and valiant men who upheld their nation, always strug- gling against the greatest odds, preserved their religion from total destruction, and left upon record examples of undying interest. 27. JOHN THE EVANGELIST. Born by the Sea of Gali- lee, and accustomed to the hardships and poverty of a fisherman's life, this man was raised, by faith in the Son of God, to the most commanding eminence among the Sons of Light. For his amiability he was styled \"the beloved Disciple.\" After the tragedy upon Calvary he took charge of Mary, the mother of Jesus. He bore exile and tortures unflinchingly for Christ's sake, and expired at the ripe age of 100 years, the last and great- est of the Apostles.

The meditative mind loves to dwell upon what bears the impress of ages long gone by. An indefinable charm lingers around aged things the oak, through whose branches have whistled the winds of a thousand winters; the mountain, whose bald summit has warded off the thunderbolts of ages ; the stately pile of art, whose arches have echoed the footsteps of untold generations and enchains the spirit as if by some magic spell. They connect us with the past, and tinge the mind with the solemn hues that color the distant. They extort an homage from the beholder that few things can. He who possesses a feeling soul will linger amid such scenes and objects with a pleasure mixed with grateful awe. And if such is the power of antiquity when connect- ing us with things inanimate, how much more potent does it become when connecting us with the society of living, sentient beings of like feelings with ourselves! How sensitive the chord, how profound the feelings it awakens there ! We no longer feel ourselves existing only now, and as individuals, but to be living at each separate period of our society's duration, and to have our hearts swell with the feelings and our minds kindle with the thoughts of all our brethren before us. Is it strange, then, that the Freemason should read the his- tory of his ancient brethren with emotions? that he should love his Order all the better for being ancient, and render it an homage profounder and more devo-"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"ANTIQUITY. 2t7 tional on that account? Had it been worthless it could never have become old. Things worthless do not so out- last the wastings of time ; do not triumph, age after age, over all the oppositions of power and intelligence, in- flamed by untiring hostility. These thoughts are suggested to our minds in taking a chronological view like that afforded by the tables above. Measuring back from the Evangelist John, we mark a long array of names of men who have left their \"footprints on the sands of time,\" and whose lives have been living monuments of the teachings of Freemasonry. A Society that flourished in the times of a Solomon, a Zerubbabel, a John a light that shone with equal brill- iancy upon an Abraham, a Moses, a Samuel is worthy of profoundest admiration, if only for its antiquity and its unchangeableness in a world so fickle as ours. To look at a table of eminent men in the earlier stages of history is to look upon the Freemasons' Roll. The principles by which these fathers of the ancient Art were actuated were few, simple, sublime. They are all communicated, either in letter or spirit, in the Moral Law, the Ten Commandments. Upon these, as a basis, men of all nations, ages, faiths could harmonize, and can harmonize. To add new rules and injunctions to these is to destroy the very Society which it is pro- posed thus to amend. This the poet has truly expressed in the following lines: The OLD is better; is it not the plan By which the Wise in by-gone days contrived To bind in willing fetters man to man And strangers in a sacred nearness lived?"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"268 THE SELECT MASTER. Is there in modern wisdom aught like that Which 'midst the blood and carnage of the plain Can calm man's fury, mitigate his hate, And join disrupted friends in love again ? No: for three thousand years the smiles of heaven, Smiles on whose sunbeams comes unmeasured joy, To this thrice-honored cement have been given, This bond, this covenant, this sacred tie: It cornea to us full-laden : from the tomb A countless host conspire to name its worth, Who sweetly sleep beneath the Acacia's bloom And there is naught like Masonry on earth, Then guard the venerable relic well; Protect it, Masters, from the unholy hand; See that its emblems the same lessons tell Sublime, through every age and every land: Be not a line erased ; the pen that drew These matchless tracings was the Pen Divine: Infinite wisdom best for mortals knew; God will preserve intact the grand design."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"A BEAUTIFUL AND ACCURATE ELEVATION OF THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON, TAKEN FROM THE CELEBRATED MODEL ERECTED BY COUNSELLOR SCHOTT, OF HAMBURG, ORNA- MENTED WITH THE MOST INTERESTING PASSAGES IN THE LIVES OP KING DAVID, AND SOLOMON, HIS SON. TKI Temple of Solomon, in general form, resembled tho Tabernacle; in fact, it was a substitute for the Tabernacle, which was only adapted to a wayfaring people, and like it, the temple was the great center of the same system of ceremonial worship. It was built upon Mount Moria, which was one summit of a range of hills, the general name of which was Mount Zion. Beginning on the north, this ridge bears the name of Bezetha, then Moriah, then Ophel, the latter running down to the junction of the ravine termed the Tyro- peon, with the valley of Jehoshaphat. Mount Moriah has an altitude on the east of about four hundred feet above the valley."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"TEMPLE OP SOLOMON. The idea of building a temple was suggested to the mind of David by the contemplation of his own good fortune, the general state of prosperity to which his country had arrived, and his fraternal relations with the Phoenician king Hiram, whose dominions afforded suitable wood, and his subjects suitable workmen, foi the edifice. It became to David an object of lively and unceasing interest; and, although, he was not per- mitted by the Almighty to take a single step in its action, yet, during the latter years of his reign, he collected precious metals to the value of many millions of dollars, besides immense quantities of brass, iron, stone and other material, and secured skillful artificers for every branch of the work. He also furnished tho design, plan and location of the building in all of which he was divinely instructed. The superintend- ence and erection of it was, however, committed to his wise son Solomon, who, in the fourth year of his reign, laid the foundation-stone and began the work. Like the Tabernacle, the Temple had its front toward the east. The porch or portico extended across the whole front, projecting fifteen feet from the main build- ing. Upon the sides and rear of the main building was an additional building of three stories, each nearly eight feet high. This structure was about half the height of the Temple proper, and, though built against the walls was not fastened to them. It was divided into apartments like chambers, which opened into the gal- lery which surrounded it. There was a flight of stairs"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"TEMPLE OF SOLOMON. on the south side which led into the second story, and another leading from the second into the third. The whole building and its environs were entered by two courts ; the inner court, called the court of the Priests, corresponds, generally, with the court of the Taber- nacle, as did also the sacred apartments, furniture, and utensils. The structure, for beauty, magnificence, and expense, exceeded every building ever known to the world. It was built with large blocks of white marble, hewn in a very curious manner, and so joined together that they deceived the eye, and looked like one entire stone. Its inner walls, beams, posts, doors, floors, and ceilings were made of cedar wood, olive wood, and planks of fir, covered with plates of gold, engraved with marks of various characters, and adorned with precious jewels of many colors, disposed in a running order. The nails which fastened these plates were of gold, with heads of curious workmanship. The roof was of olive wood, covered with plates of gold which shone with such brightness as to dazzle the eyes of the beholder. The court in which the Temple stood, and those without it, were built on all sides with stately buildings and cloisters; and the gates entering therein were very beautiful and sumptuous. The vessels consecrated to the perpetual use of the Temple were not less noble than the pile itself.

Thero were, likewise, two hundred trumpets, and forty thou- sand other musical instruments made use of in prais- ing God. By Yillalpandus's computation of the num- ber of talents of gold, silver, and brass laid out upon the Temple, the sum amounts to six thousand nine hundred and four millions, eight hundred and twenty- two thousand and five hundred pounds sterling; and the jewels are reckoned to exceed this sum; while ac- cording to Capel's reduction of the talents contained in the gold and silver vessels in the use of the Temple, the sum of the gold ones amounts to five hundred and forty -five millions, two hundred and ninety-six thou- sand, two hundred and three pounds and four shill- ings sterling, and the silver came to four hundred and thirty-nine millions, three hundred and forty -four thousand pounds sterling. Besides these, there were charges for other materials, and of ten thousand men per month in Lebanon to hew timber, seventy thousand to carry burdens, eighty thousand to hew stones, and three thousand three hundred overseers, who were all employed for seven years ; and to whom, besides their regular wages and food, Solomon gave, as a free gift, six millions seven hundred and thirty -three thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven pounds sterling.

The most interesting portion of this structure was, however, the Sanctum Sanctorum, or Holy of Holies, which was a room thirty feet square and thirty feet high. The floor of this apartment was overlaid with gold, and the walls adorned with palm-trees and cher- ubim. The gold finish of this small apartment ab- sorbed four millions three hundred and twenty-seven pounds sterling. This most holy place was made on purpose to be a tabernacle for the Ark, which was placed in the middle of it between two cherubims of image work, each fifteen feet high, having their wings expanded each five cubits long, two of which touched the walls, while the other two met and touched each other exactly over the middle of the ark, their faces being turned inward in a worshiping posture. Tho Ark, called the \"glory of Israel,\" was a small chest or coffer, three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches wide, and three feet three inches high. It was made of wood, excepting only the top or mercy- seat, but all overlaid with gold both inside and out,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"TEMPLE OP SOLOMON. and it had a ledge of gold surrounding it at the top into which, as into a socket, was let the cover called the \" Mercy-seat. 1 ' This mercy-seat was made of solid gold, the thickness of a hand's breadth. At tho two ends of it were two cherubim, looking inward toward each other, with their wings expanded, and embracing the whole circumference of the \"mercy-seat,\" met on every side and in the middle. The whole of this \"mercy-seat,\" it was affirmed by the Eabbins, was made out of one solid lump of gold, with neither rivets nor soldering of any of its parts. It was here the Shekinah or Divine Presence rested, and was visi- ble in the appearance of a cloud above it. From hence the Bathkoll issued and gave answers when God was consulted, and hence it is that God is said, in Scripture, to dwell between the cherubim that is be- tween the cherubim on the mercy-seat because there was the seat or throne of the visible appearance of God's glory among them. This work was engraved at Boston, Mass., upon two steel plates, from the celebrated design of Chancellor Schott, of Hamburg, at a cost exceeding two thousand dollars. Nothing but an examination will afford a sufficient idea of the fund of instruction embodied in this work. The border designs, of which there are eight, the drawings sub- sidiary, of which there are four, and the scriptural and historical passages thickly interspersed, make it a perfect cyclopedia of the subject. The size of the plate is 24 by 42 inches, and the price is, for plain prints $2, and for colored $2.50 each. Where clubs of five or more unite, the prices will be $1.50 for plain, and $.2.00 for colored copies."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"mm UNIVEESITY OF CALIFOKNIA ' LIBKARY, BERKELEY THIS BOOK IS DUE ON THE LAST DATE STAMPED BELOW Books not returned on time are subject to a fine of 50c per volume after the third day overdue, increasing to $1.00 per volume after the sixth day.
